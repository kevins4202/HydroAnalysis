24055,near inertial internal waves niws play an important role in furnishing ocean diapycnal mixing however parameterization of niw induced mixing in high resolution ocean general circulation models ogcms remains a challenging problem partially due to the lack of appropriate tools for isolating niws during the model integration in this study we propose two new methods feasible for online isolation of niws in high resolution ogcms i e the two step filter and three step filter the two step filter only requires the velocity records to be stored at two time steps it performs reasonably well in isolating niws poleward of 30 if the time step is set as 6 h by utilizing the velocity information at one additional time step the three step filter with a time step of 6 h generally outperforms the two step filter in the global ocean specifically the three step filter results in reasonable isolation of niws poleward of 15 where the niw induced mixing is strongest keywords near inertial internal waves energy spectrum filter ocean general circulation model 1 introduction near inertial internal waves niws are ubiquitous in the global ocean alford et al 2016 they are characterized by a prominent peak located slightly above the local inertial frequency in the ocean current frequency spectrum garrett and munk 1972 1975 fu 1981 garrett 2001 accounting for almost half of the kinetic energy in the internal wave field ferrari and wunsch 2009 niws are suggested to play an important role in furnishing diapycnal mixing in both the surface mixed layer and ocean interior munk and wunsch 1998 wunsch and ferrari 2004 jing and wu 2014 however their contribution to diapycnal mixing is not adequately represented in the current generation of ocean general circulation models ogcms so far most models employ a k profile parameterization scheme kpp large et al 1994 with a tidal mixing parameterization scheme also included in some of them st laurent et al 2002 these schemes do not parameterize the diapycnal mixing induced by niws so that their contribution is completely neglected in the past few years several schemes for niw induced diapycnal mixing have been proposed jochum et al 2013 olbers and eden 2013 eden and olbers 2014 jing et al 2016 jochum et al 2013 dealt with the niw induced mixing in both the mixed layer and ocean interior while olbers and eden 2013 and eden and olbers 2014 focused on the parameterization of niw induced mixing below the mixed layer to parameterize the downward radiation of niws in the ocean jochum et al 2013 adopted empirical functions borrowed from tidal schemes whereas olbers and eden 2013 and eden and olbers 2014 derived the parameterizations from the radiation balance equations and wave wave interactions one deficiency in these parameterizations is the neglect of influence of wave mean flow interactions the background flow can both exchange energy with niws and affect their propagation in particular theoretical analyses suggest that the spatially inhomogeneous relative vorticity of background flow plays a crucial role in promoting the downward propagation of niws kunze 1985 young and ben jelloul 1997 balmforth et al 1998 specifically the downward propagation is significantly enhanced in the local minimum of relative vorticity which has been confirmed by elevated niw activity in mesoscale anticyclonic eddies in observations and numerical simulations lee and niiler 1998 zhai et al 2005 2007 2009 jing and wu 2014 the scheme proposed by olbers and eden 2013 and eden and olbers 2014 could be extended to include the interactions between mean flow and niws recently olbers and eden 2017 and eden and olbers 2017 parameterized the interactions between background flow and niws through the vertical shear of background flow alternatively the scheme can be built directly on the model simulated niws in the ocean interior to skip the complicated impact of background flow on niws as done by jing et al 2016 in which diapycnal mixing is related to local niw activity and downscale energy cascade is parameterized by a finescale parameterization modified to account for the underestimation of near inertial shear variance by finite model vertical grid size however the applicability of this scheme requires reliable simulation of both the mesoscale eddy field and surface near inertial wind power which could be a challenging issue for the current generation of global climate models in addition to the dynamical limitations some existing niw parameterization schemes are subject to a technical challenge e g jochum et al 2013 jing et al 2016 i e online 1 1 here online means during the model integration isolation of horizontal current of niws in numerical models the usual method to isolate niws is to apply a band pass filter this method is however inapplicable for online computation as it requires storing horizontal velocity records at many time steps and is hence unaffordable given the limited random access memory ram resources jochum et al 2013 proposed a new isolation method only utilizing the velocity records at two adjacent model integration time steps so that it does not involve any additional storage burdens application of this method to a coarse resolution 1 climate model shows good performance in isolating niws at mid and high latitudes where the niw induced mixing is strongest as demonstrated in section 2 the applicability of this method is however based on the strong damping of super inertial internal waves by coarse resolution models for high resolution models the super inertial internal waves are better simulated and using the method proposed by jochum et al 2013 could lead to severe contamination of niws by super inertial signals in this study we propose new methods for online isolation of niws in high resolution numerical models the new methods only require the velocity records to be stored at one or two additional time step s so that they are still computationally affordable the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we review the basis for signal filtering and propose the new methods in section 3 we evaluate the performance of the new methods by applying them to the 1 12 hybrid coordinate ocean model global reanalysis hycom https hycom org bleck 2002 chassignet et al 2007 conclusions are summarized in section 4 followed by discussion 2 methodology 2 1 two step filter the most straightforward way to isolate niws is to implement a band pass filter 1 z t k l z t k t l h t l where z t k u t k i v t k is the complex horizontal velocity at the kth time step t k k δ t i 1 z t k is the velocity after filtering and h tl is the impulse response function according to the convolution theorem we have 2 p ω h ω p ω where ω is the radian frequency p ω p ω and h ω are the power spectrum of z z and h respectively to effectively isolate niws the value of h ω should be close to unity within some predefined near inertial band say 0 8f 1 3f where f is the local inertial frequency but decrease rapidly to zero outside this requires that the array of h tl is composed of a lot of nonzero terms storing the velocity data at a large number of time steps is not a problem for offline isolation of niws but it will impose unaffordable burdens on the ram for online usage here we first propose a method for online isolation of niws using the velocity records only at two time steps referred to as the two step filter henceforth 3 z t k b z t k 1 c z t k where b s b c s c where b and c are real numbers s can be complex valued the power transfer function of the two step filter is 4 h ω s 2 b e i ω δ t c 2 in the real oceans the frequency spectrum of horizontal current is characterized by a spectral plateau at the lowest frequencies decreasing approximately according to the ω p law where p is an empirical constant forming a pronounced peak inside the near inertial band and then decreasing again according to another power law of ω 2 garrett and munk 1972 fu 1981 ferrari and wunsch 2009 figs 1 and 2 therefore to make the two step filter effective in isolating niws we propose the following conditions to be satisfied 1 h 0 0 2 the amplitude and phase of an inertial oscillation are conserved before and after filtering condition 1 is for suppressing the sub inertial motions detailed derivation is given in appendix a the expression of the two step filter that satisfies both aforementioned conditions is 5 z t k s z t k 1 s z t k where s 1 exp i f δ t 1 we remark that our two step filter reduces to the filter proposed by jochum et al 2013 for fδt approaching zero however the two methods differ substantially from each other when fδt is on the order of unity see appendix b for details fig 3 displays the power transfer function of the two step filter h 2 ω φ δt where φ is the latitude the two step filter exhibits different behaviours depending on the value of δt for small δt values the two step filter resembles a high pass filter in particular h 2 is on the order of ω 2 δt 2 when ω 2 δt 2 1 implying its merits of suppressing the sub inertial motions however this is at the expense of the undesired amplification of super inertial signals such amplification is more severe at low latitudes with smaller δt for large δt values the behaviour of the two step filter becomes complicated with h 2 ω φ δt exhibiting one or several peaks in the frequency domain in particular when the value of δt becomes sufficiently large e g δ t 12 h a pronounced sub inertial peak of h 2 ω φ δt occurs at the high latitudes making the two step filter ineffective in suppressing sub inertial signals to further evaluate the performance of the two step filter we apply it to the surface horizontal velocity records at the kuroshio extension observatory keo 32 3 n 144 6 e and ocean station papa papa 50 1 n 144 9 w respectively figs 1 and 2 tables 1 and 2 the velocity obtained from a band pass filter that retains signals within 0 8f 1 3f is used as the benchmark for comparisons consistent with the dependence of h 2 ω φ δt on δt fig 3 there is a tradeoff between the contamination by sub inertial and super inertial signals figs 1 and 2 using a small δt can effectively filter out the sub inertial signals at the expense of stronger contamination by super inertial signals the opposite is true for the usage of a large δt we remark that the filtered motions are dominated by super inertial signals at both the stations when fδt 1 leading to weak correlation between the kinetic energy of filtered velocity from the two step filter ke2 and band pass filter ke b these results suggest that the filtering method proposed by jochum et al 2013 might be inapplicable to the observational data its validity in isolating niws in a coarse resolution ogcm is probably due to the much weaker super inertial signals in such models than in the observation at keo the optimal δt value seems to be 12 h leading to the highest correlation between ke2 and keb among other δt values table 1 in contrast the optimal δt value at papa seems to be 6 h table 2 the case dependent optimal δt value might result from the difference in the frequency spectra of ocean current and the dependence of h 2 ω φ δt on the latitude figs 1 3 therefore the two step filter cannot achieve the best performance globally with a single δt value to compensate for the shortcomings of the two step filter we further propose another filter by including the velocity record at one additional time step referred to as the three step filter henceforth in the following subsection 2 2 three step filter the three step filter is of the form 6 z t k a z t k 2 b z t k 1 c z t k where a s a b s b c s c where a b and c are real numbers and s is a complex number the power transfer function of the three step filter is 7 h ω s 2 a e 2 i ω δ t b e i ω δ t c 2 to make the three step filter effective in isolating niws we propose the following conditions to be satisfied 1 h 0 0 2 the amplitude and phase of an inertial oscillation are conserved before and after filtering 3 ω f is a local maximum point of h ω the first two conditions are also satisfied by the two step filter whereas the third condition is unique to the three step filter condition 3 guarantees that the contamination by super inertial motions is minor even if the super inertial motions could be as strong as those in observations detailed derivation of the coefficients is given in appendix c at the latitudes where cos fδt 0 we can find a unique solution of a b and c that satisfies the three aforementioned conditions 8 a 1 2 1 q 1 q 9 b 4 a c cos f δ t a c 10 c 1 2 1 q 1 q 11 s 1 a e 2 i f δ t b e i f δ t c where 12 q 1 1 2 cos f δ t it should be noted that there is no single value of δt that satisfies cos fδt 0 globally as the niw induced diapycnal mixing is largest at the mid and high latitudes whalen et al 2012 jing and wu 2014 pollmann et al 2017 we set δ t 6 h to make the range of latitudes where the three aforementioned conditions are all satisfied as large as possible while covering the mid and high latitudes at the latitudes where cos fδt 0 no solution can be found we extend the solution at the critical latitude φ0 29 9 for δ t 6 h to the region at lower latitudes i e 13 a 1 14 b 0 15 c 1 where s retains the same form as in eq 11 in this case the three step filter reduces to the two step filter with a doubled δt value equatorward of the critical latitude fig 4 displays the power transfer function of the three step filter h 3 ω φ δt with δ t 6 h the shapes of h 3 ω φ 6 h and h 2 ω φ 12 h are identical equatorward of φ0 as expected further poleward h 3 ω φ δt and h 2 ω φ δt diverge significantly for instance the maximum of h 2 ω φ 12 h reaches up to 2 3 at 50 and 6 2 at 60 whereas the maximum of h 3 ω φ 6 h remains unity at these latitudes and thus avoids the undesired amplification of super inertial signals the three step filter with δ t 6 h performs reasonably well in isolating niws at the keo and papa stations tables 1 and 2 figs 1 and 2 the contribution of niws to the filtered signals in kinetic energy here contribution is defined as the ratio of the kinetic energy in a frequency band to the kinetic energy of the filtered motions reaches up to 70 4 at keo table 1 and 85 5 at papa table 2 as a result the kinetic energy of the velocity filtered by the three step filter ke3 is tightly correlated to keb with the correlation coefficients being 0 75 and 0 89 at keo and papa respectively tables 1 and 2 we remark that the three step filter with δ t 6 h always outperforms the two step filter if their performances at the two stations are evaluated as a whole 3 results in this section we evaluate the performance of the proposed filters in a high resolution 0 1 ogcm the hycom global 1 12 reanalysis of 2008 with a temporal resolution of 3 h is used the reanalysis data have a uniform 0 08 0 08 horizontal grid and 40 standard z levels the vertical grid size ranges from 2 m to 5 m in the upper 50 m and increases to about 1000 m near the seafloor atmospheric forcing is derived from the hourly national centers for environmental prediction ncep climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr with a horizontal resolution of 0 3125 the kpp scheme is used to represent the vertical mixing process the time steps of the two step filters are set as 3 h 6 h and 12 h respectively whereas the time step of the three step filter is fixed at 6 h 3 1 kinetic energy we first evaluate the performance of the proposed filters in terms of the near inertial kinetic energy fig 5 a displays the global distribution of keb it is characterized by strong spatial variability with its value varying by more than two orders of magnitude high energy level is located in the western part of mid latitude pacific and atlantic and the southern ocean due to the strong storm activity trenberth 1991 chang et al 2002 the pattern of keb also exhibits an enhancement in the regions affected by tropical cyclones and in the eastern tropical pacific due to the intermittent wind jets of central america chelton et al 2000a 2000b such a spatial pattern is generally consistent with that observed from the surface drifters chaigneau et al 2008 suggesting that hycom provides a reliable representation of niws in the real ocean the spatial distribution of ke2 generally agrees with that of keb at the mid or high latitudes but diverges from keb significantly at the low latitudes fig 5 b d for δ t 3 h ke2 biases high by one to two orders of magnitude within 20 in latitude the large bias in this region is mainly due to the contamination by super inertial signals fig 6 this bias can be partially remedied by using a larger δt as the maximum of h 2 decreases with δt fig 3 for instance the contamination by super inertial signals at 20 n is about 60 for δ t 3 h but is reduced to 52 for δ t 6 h and 36 for δ t 12 h as a result the overall magnitude of ke2 in the subtropical region agrees progressively better with keb as δt becomes larger the improved performance of the two step filter with increased δt in the subtropical region is however at the expense of a performance degradation at the high latitudes for instance ke2 with δ t 12 h biases high by more than two orders of magnitude poleward of 60 this large bias is mainly due to the contamination by the sub inertial signals as using a large δt increases the value of h 2 in the sub inertial band this increase is more evident at the high latitudes making the two step filter less efficient in filtering out the sub inertial signals fig 3 fig 6 the three step filter with δ t 6 h generally performs better compared with the two step filters ke3 exhibits overall agreement with keb in the global ocean except equatorward of 15 where the niw induced diapycnal mixing is less important to further quantify the performance of different filters we compute the correlation coefficient r k of ke2 ke3 and keb and the mean squared error ϵk which is defined as 16 ϵ k 1 n k 1 n ke t k ke b t k 2 where ke tk stands for either ke2 or ke3 at the kth time step and n is the number of sampling points fig 7 displays the global distribution of r k among the two step filters δ t 6 h achieves the best performance using δ t 3 h leads to evident reduction of r k in the subtropical region midlatitude western boundary current extensions and southern ocean due to the contamination of super inertial signals fig 6 in contrast increasing δt to 12 h makes the correlation poleward of 60 become insignificant as the filtered signals are strongly contaminated by sub inertial motions fig 6 the three step filter with δ t 6 h generally outperforms the two step filters the value of r k from the three step filter with δ t 6 h is systematically higher than that from the two step filter with δ t 3 h in the global ocean compared with the two step filters with δ t 6 h and 12 h the three step filter with δ t 6 h performs better in the subtropical and high latitude regions respectively comparisons of ϵk among different filters also favor the superiority of the three step filter with δ t 6 h fig 8 for instance ϵk of the three step filter with δ t 6 h is systematically smaller than that of the two step filter with δ t 12 h poleward of 30 the reduction in ϵk of the three step filter is most significant in the subtropical regions where the ϵk of the three step filter with δ t 6 h is less than that of the two step filter with δ t 3 h or δ t 6 h by almost one order of magnitude 3 2 wind power in some parameterizations olbers and eden 2013 eden and olbers 2014 the surface wind power on niws is a key model input in this subsection we analyze the performance of the proposed filters in isolating the near inertial wind power wp defined as 17 wp u τ u τ x v τ y where τx and τy are the zonal and meridional wind stress components respectively fig 9 a displays the global distribution of wp derived from the band pass filter denoted as wpb consistent with previous numerical studies jiang et al 2005 furuichi et al 2008 simmons and alford 2012 rimac et al 2013 2016 enhanced wpb occurs in the regions with strong atmospheric storm activities the global integrated value of wpb is 0 87 tw table 3 which is within the range 0 3 1 4 tw from previous estimates jiang et al 2005 furuichi et al 2008 simmons and alford 2012 rimac et al 2013 2016 the performances of the proposed filters in isolating near inertial wind power are generally similar to those in isolating the near inertial kinetic energy figs 9 11 for the two step filters setting δ t 6 h results in the best performance the three step filter with δ t 6 h outperforms the two step filter with δ t 6 h in the subtropical region but degrades slightly at the midlatitudes furthermore although the near inertial kinetic energy derived from all the proposed filters strongly biases high at the low latitudes due to the contamination of super inertial signals such bias is largely alleviated for the near inertial wind power fig 9 this might be due to the weak correlation between the super inertial motions and wind stress which is expectable given that the super inertial motions in the ocean do not resonate with the wind forcing finally it should be noted that as the temporal resolution of the hycom reanalysis is 3 h the two step filter with δt set as the model integration time step 100 s cannot be applied nevertheless its performance could be inferred based on the analysis above as demonstrated in figs 5 11 the degraded performance of the two step filter with δ t 3 h compared to that with δ t 6 h results mainly from the contamination by the super inertial motions as such contamination becomes more severe with a decreasing δt it suggests that the two step filter with δt 3 h might be ineffective in isolating niws in high resolution ogcms 4 conclusions and discussion in this study we propose two methods for the online isolation of niws in ogcms and evaluate their performance using the observational and high resolution ogcm data the new methods only require the velocity records to be stored at one or two additional time step s so that they are still computationally affordable the major conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the two step filter suppresses the sub inertial signals at the expense of undesired amplification of super inertial signals this results in a tradeoff between the contamination by the sub inertial and super inertial signals depending on the value of time step δt the optimal δt relies on the frequency spectra of ocean current and latitude using δ t 6 h yields reasonable isolation of niws in a high resolution ogcm at the mid or high latitudes however the filtered velocities are severely contaminated by super inertial signals equatorward of 30 2 the three step filter with a properly chosen time step in this work we set it as δ t 6 h can significantly reduce the contamination by super inertial motions in high resolution ogcms its performance in the global ocean as a whole surpasses that of the two step filters in particular the three step filter with δ t 6 h leads to reliable isolation of niws poleward of 15 where the niw induced diapycnal mixing is most significant our analysis suggests that the performance of an online filter is strongly affected by the frequency spectrum of the ocean current that the filter is applied to the main defect of the two step filters including the one proposed by jochum et al 2013 is the amplification of super inertial signals this amplification might be less important in the coarse resolution ogcms where the super inertial motions are strongly damped by models however in the high resolution ogcms where the super inertial motions are better resolved the amplification of super inertial signals by two step filters could become a severe problem in this case using the three step filter with δ t 6 h is more desirable the major defect of the proposed two step and three step filters is their strong degradation in the tropical region due to the severe contamination by the super inertial signals this is because condition 3 cannot be satisfied equatorward of φ0 29 9 for δ t 6 h this shortcoming might be remedied by adding another time step to the three step filter i e developing a filter with four time steps involved but at the expense of increased storage requirements an alternative strategy is to revise conditions 1 and 3 so that we can uniquely determine the coefficients of the filter globally while keeping the filter effective in isolating niws these possibilities will be investigated in future studies acknowledgments this work was

substitution of eq c 4 into cos fδt indicates that there is no δt such that cos fδt 0 holds globally therefore we have to divide the scheme of the three step filter the into two parts at the latitudes

performance of the new methods by applying them to the 1 12 hybrid coordinate ocean model global reanalysis hycom https hycom org bleck 2002 chassignet et al 2007 conclusions are summarized in section 4 followed by discussion 2 methodology 2 1 two step filter the most straightforward way to isolate niws is to implement a band pass filter 1 z t k l z t k t l h t l where z t k u t k i v t k is the complex horizontal velocity at the kth time step t k k δ t i 1 z t k is the velocity after filtering and h tl is the impulse response function according to the convolution theorem we have 2 p ω h ω p ω where ω is the radian frequency p ω p ω and h ω are the power spectrum of z z and h respectively to effectively isolate niws the value of h ω should be close to unity within some predefined near inertial band say 0 8f 1 3f where f is the local inertial frequency but decrease rapidly to zero outside this requires that the array of h tl is composed of a lot of nonzero terms storing the velocity data at a large number of time steps is not a problem for offline isolation of niws but it will impose unaffordable burdens on the ram for online usage here we first propose a method for online isolation of niws using the velocity records only at two time steps referred to as the two step filter henceforth 3 z t k b z t k 1 c z t k where b s b c s c where b and c are real numbers s can be complex valued the power transfer function of the two step filter is 4 h ω s 2 b e i ω δ t c 2 in the real oceans the frequency spectrum of horizontal current is characterized by a spectral plateau at the lowest frequencies decreasing approximately according to the ω p law where p is an empirical constant forming a pronounced peak inside the near inertial band and then decreasing again according to another power law of ω 2 garrett and munk 1972 fu 1981 ferrari and wunsch 2009 figs 1 and 2 therefore to make the two step filter effective in isolating niws we propose the following conditions to be satisfied 1 h 0 0 2 the amplitude and phase of an inertial oscillation are conserved before and after filtering condition 1 is for suppressing the sub inertial motions detailed derivation is given in appendix a the expression of the two step filter that satisfies both aforementioned conditions is 5 z t k s z t k 1 s z t k where s 1 exp i f δ t 1 we remark that our two step filter reduces to the filter proposed by jochum et al 2013 for fδt approaching zero however the two methods differ substantially from each other when fδt is on the order of unity see appendix b for details fig 3 displays the power transfer function of the two step filter h 2 ω φ δt where φ is the latitude the two step filter exhibits different behaviours depending on the value of δt for small δt values the two step filter resembles a high pass filter in particular h 2 is on the order of ω 2 δt 2 when ω 2 δt 2 1 implying its merits of suppressing the sub inertial motions however this is at the expense of the undesired amplification of super inertial signals such amplification is more severe at low latitudes with smaller δt for large δt values the behaviour of the two step filter becomes complicated with h 2 ω φ δt exhibiting one or several peaks in the frequency domain in particular when the value of δt becomes sufficiently large e g δ t 12 h a pronounced sub inertial peak of h 2 ω φ δt occurs at the high latitudes making the two step filter ineffective in suppressing sub inertial signals to further evaluate the performance of the two step filter we apply it to the surface horizontal velocity records at the kuroshio extension observatory keo 32 3 n 144 6 e and ocean station papa papa 50 1 n 144 9 w respectively figs 1 and 2 tables 1 and 2 the velocity obtained from a band pass filter that retains signals within 0 8f 1 3f is used as the benchmark for comparisons consistent with the dependence of h 2 ω φ δt on δt fig 3 there is a tradeoff between the contamination by sub inertial and super inertial signals figs 1 and 2 using a small δt can effectively filter out the sub inertial signals at the expense of stronger contamination by super inertial signals the opposite is true for the usage of a large δt we remark that the filtered motions are dominated by super inertial signals at both the stations when fδt 1 leading to weak correlation between the kinetic energy of filtered velocity from the two step filter ke2 and band pass filter ke b these results suggest that the filtering method proposed by jochum et al 2013 might be inapplicable to the observational data its validity in isolating niws in a coarse resolution ogcm is probably due to the much weaker super inertial signals in such models than in the observation at keo the optimal δt value seems to be 12 h leading to the highest correlation between ke2 and keb among other δt values table 1 in contrast the optimal δt value at papa seems to be 6 h table 2 the case dependent optimal δt value might result from the difference in the frequency spectra of ocean current and the dependence of h 2 ω φ δt on the latitude figs 1 3 therefore the two step filter cannot achieve the best performance globally with a single δt value to compensate for the shortcomings of the two step filter we further propose another filter by including the velocity record at one additional time step referred to as the three step filter henceforth in the following subsection 2 2 three step filter the three step filter is of the form 6 z t k a z t k 2 b z t k 1 c z t k where a s a b s b c s c where a b and c are real numbers and s is a complex number the power transfer function of the three step filter is 7 h ω s 2 a e 2 i ω δ t b e i ω δ t c 2 to make the three step filter effective in isolating niws we propose the following conditions to be satisfied 1 h 0 0 2 the amplitude and phase of an inertial oscillation are conserved before and after filtering 3 ω f is a local maximum point of h ω the first two conditions are also satisfied by the two step filter whereas the third condition is unique to the three step filter condition 3 guarantees that the contamination by super inertial motions is minor even if the super inertial motions could be as strong as those in observations detailed derivation of the coefficients is given in appendix c at the latitudes where cos fδt 0 we can find a unique solution of a b and c that satisfies the three aforementioned conditions 8 a 1 2 1 q 1 q 9 b 4 a c cos f δ t a c 10 c 1 2 1 q 1 q 11 s 1 a e 2 i f δ t b e i f δ t c where 12 q 1 1 2 cos f δ t it should be noted that there is no single value of δt that satisfies cos fδt 0 globally as the niw induced diapycnal mixing is largest at the mid and high latitudes whalen et al 2012 jing and wu 2014 pollmann et al 2017 we set δ t 6 h to make the range of latitudes where the three aforementioned conditions are all satisfied as large as possible while covering the mid and high latitudes at the latitudes where cos fδt 0 no solution can be found we extend the solution at the critical latitude φ0 29 9 for δ t 6 h to the region at lower latitudes i e 13 a 1 14 b 0 15 c 1 where s retains the same form as in eq 11 in this case the three step filter reduces to the two step filter with a doubled δt value equatorward of the critical latitude fig 4 displays the power transfer function of the three step filter h 3 ω φ δt with δ t 6 h the shapes of h 3 ω φ 6 h and h 2 ω φ 12 h are identical equatorward of φ0 as expected further poleward h 3 ω φ δt and h 2 ω φ δt diverge significantly for instance the maximum of h 2 ω φ 12 h reaches up to 2 3 at 50 and 6 2 at 60 whereas the maximum of h 3 ω φ 6 h remains unity at these latitudes and thus avoids the undesired amplification of super inertial signals the three step filter with δ t 6 h performs reasonably well in isolating niws at the keo and papa stations tables 1 and 2 figs 1 and 2 the contribution of niws to the filtered signals in kinetic energy here contribution is defined as the ratio of the kinetic energy in a frequency band to the kinetic energy of the filtered motions reaches up to 70 4 at keo table 1 and 85 5 at papa table 2 as a result the kinetic energy of the velocity filtered by the three step filter ke3 is tightly correlated to keb with the correlation coefficients being 0 75 and 0 89 at keo and papa respectively tables 1 and 2 we remark that the three step filter with δ t 6 h always outperforms the two step filter if their performances at the two stations are evaluated as a whole 3 results in this section we evaluate the performance of the proposed filters in a high resolution 0 1 ogcm the hycom global 1 12 reanalysis of 2008 with a temporal resolution of 3 h is used the reanalysis data have a uniform 0 08 0 08 horizontal grid and 40 standard z levels the vertical grid size ranges from 2 m to 5 m in the upper 50 m and increases to about 1000 m near the seafloor atmospheric forcing is derived from the hourly national centers for environmental prediction ncep climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr with a horizontal resolution of 0 3125 the kpp scheme is used to represent the vertical mixing process the time steps of the two step filters are set as 3 h 6 h and 12 h respectively whereas the time step of the three step filter is fixed at 6 h 3 1 kinetic energy we first evaluate the performance of the proposed filters in terms of the near inertial kinetic energy fig 5 a displays the global distribution of keb it is characterized by strong spatial variability with its value varying by more than two orders of magnitude high energy level is located in the western part of mid latitude pacific and atlantic and the southern ocean due to the strong storm activity trenberth 1991 chang et al 2002 the pattern of keb also exhibits an enhancement in the regions affected by tropical cyclones and in the eastern tropical pacific due to the intermittent wind jets of central america chelton et al 2000a 2000b such a spatial pattern is generally consistent with that observed from the surface drifters chaigneau et al 2008 suggesting that hycom provides a reliable representation of niws in the real ocean the spatial distribution of ke2 generally agrees with that of keb at the mid or high latitudes but diverges from keb significantly at the low latitudes fig 5 b d for δ t 3 h ke2 biases high by one to two orders of magnitude within 20 in latitude the large bias in this region is mainly due to the contamination by super inertial signals fig 6 this bias can be partially remedied by using a larger δt as the maximum of h 2 decreases with δt fig 3 for instance the contamination by super inertial signals at 20 n is about 60 for δ t 3 h but is reduced to 52 for δ t 6 h and 36 for δ t 12 h as a result the overall magnitude of ke2 in the subtropical region agrees progressively better with keb as δt becomes larger the improved performance of the two step filter with increased δt in the subtropical region is however at the expense of a performance degradation at the high latitudes for instance ke2 with δ t 12 h biases high by more than two orders of magnitude poleward of 60 this large bias is mainly due to the contamination by the sub inertial signals as using a large δt increases the value of h 2 in the sub inertial band this increase is more evident at the high latitudes making the two step filter less efficient in filtering out the sub inertial signals fig 3 fig 6 the three step filter with δ t 6 h generally performs better compared with the two step filters ke3 exhibits overall agreement with keb in the global ocean except equatorward of 15 where the niw induced diapycnal mixing is less important to further quantify the performance of different filters we compute the correlation coefficient r k of ke2 ke3 and keb and the mean squared error ϵk which is defined as 16 ϵ k 1 n k 1 n ke t k ke b t k 2 where ke tk stands for either ke2 or ke3 at the kth time step and n is the number of sampling points fig 7 displays the global distribution of r k among the two step filters δ t 6 h achieves the best performance using δ t 3 h leads to evident reduction of r k in the subtropical region midlatitude western boundary current extensions and southern ocean due to the contamination of super inertial signals fig 6 in contrast increasing δt to 12 h makes the correlation poleward of 60 become insignificant as the filtered signals are strongly contaminated by sub inertial motions fig 6 the three step filter with δ t 6 h generally outperforms the two step filters the value of r k from the three step filter with δ t 6 h is systematically higher than that from the two step filter with δ t 3 h in the global ocean compared with the two step filters with δ t 6 h and 12 h the three step filter with δ t 6 h performs better in the subtropical and high latitude regions respectively comparisons of ϵk among different filters also favor the superiority of the three step filter with δ t 6 h fig 8 for instance ϵk of the three step filter with δ t 6 h is systematically smaller than that of the two step filter with δ t 12 h poleward of 30 the reduction in ϵk of the three step filter is most significant in the subtropical regions where the ϵk of the three step filter with δ t 6 h is less than that of the two step filter with δ t 3 h or δ t 6 h by almost one order of magnitude 3 2 wind power in some parameterizations olbers and eden 2013 eden and olbers 2014 the surface wind power on niws is a key model input in this subsection we analyze the performance of the proposed filters in isolating the near inertial wind power wp defined as 17 wp u τ u τ x v τ y where τx and τy are the zonal and meridional wind stress components respectively fig 9 a displays the global distribution of wp derived from the band pass filter denoted as wpb consistent with previous numerical studies jiang et al 2005 furuichi et al 2008 simmons and alford 2012 rimac et al 2013 2016 enhanced wpb occurs in the regions with strong atmospheric storm activities the global integrated value of wpb is 0 87 tw table 3 which is within the range 0 3 1 4 tw from previous estimates jiang et al 2005 furuichi et al 2008 simmons and alford 2012 rimac et al 2013 2016 the performances of the proposed filters in isolating near inertial wind power are generally similar to those in isolating the near inertial kinetic energy figs 9 11 for the two step filters setting δ t 6 h results in the best performance the three step filter with δ t 6 h outperforms the two step filter with δ t 6 h in the subtropical region but degrades slightly at the midlatitudes furthermore although the near inertial kinetic energy derived from all the proposed filters strongly biases high at the low latitudes due to the contamination of super inertial signals such bias is largely alleviated for the near inertial wind power fig 9 this might be due to the weak correlation between the super inertial motions and wind stress which is expectable given that the super inertial motions in the ocean do not resonate with the wind forcing finally it should be noted that as the temporal resolution of the hycom reanalysis is 3 h the two step filter with δt set as the model integration time step 100 s cannot be applied nevertheless its performance could be inferred based on the analysis above as demonstrated in figs 5 11 the degraded performance of the two step filter with δ t 3 h compared to that with δ t 6 h results mainly from the contamination by the super inertial motions as such contamination becomes more severe with a decreasing δt it suggests that the two step filter with δt 3 h might be ineffective in isolating niws in high resolution ogcms 4 conclusions and discussion in this study we propose two methods for the online isolation of niws in ogcms and evaluate their performance using the observational and high resolution ogcm data the new methods only require the velocity records to be stored at one or two additional time step s so that they are still computationally affordable the major conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the two step filter suppresses the sub inertial signals at the expense of undesired amplification of super inertial signals this results in a tradeoff between the contamination by the sub inertial and super inertial signals depending on the value of time step δt the optimal δt relies on the frequency spectra of ocean current and latitude using δ t 6 h yields reasonable isolation of niws in a high resolution ogcm at the mid or high latitudes however the filtered velocities are severely contaminated by super inertial signals equatorward of 30 2 the three step filter with a properly chosen time step in this work we set it as δ t 6 h can significantly reduce the contamination by super inertial motions in high resolution ogcms its performance in the global ocean as a whole surpasses that of the two step filters in particular the three step filter with δ t 6 h leads to reliable isolation of niws poleward of 15 where the niw induced diapycnal mixing is most significant our analysis suggests that the performance of an online filter is strongly affected by the frequency spectrum of the ocean current that the filter is applied to the main defect of the two step filters including the one proposed by jochum et al 2013 is the amplification of super inertial signals this amplification might be less important in the coarse resolution ogcms where the super inertial motions are strongly damped by models however in the high resolution ogcms where the super inertial motions are better resolved the amplification of super inertial signals by two step filters could become a severe problem in this case using the three step filter with δ t 6 h is more desirable the major defect of the proposed two step and three step filters is their strong degradation in the tropical region due to the severe contamination by the super inertial signals this is because condition 3 cannot be satisfied equatorward of φ0 29 9 for δ t 6 h this shortcoming might be remedied by adding another time step to the three step filter i e developing a filter with four time steps involved but at the expense of increased storage requirements an alternative strategy is to revise conditions 1 and 3 so that we can uniquely determine the coefficients of the filter globally while keeping the filter effective in isolating niws these possibilities will be investigated in future studies acknowledgments this work was

substitution of eq c 4 into cos fδt indicates that there is no δt such that cos fδt 0 holds globally therefore we have to divide the scheme of the three step filter the into two parts at the latitudes

corresponding author 1 present address department of earth sciences national natural science foundation of china total variation diminishing tvd advection schemes are widely used in ocean modelling due to the constraints of flux limiters tvd schemes with common single flux limiters of second order or third order accuracy exhibit defects associated with numerical compression or diffusion to reduce the numerical errors induced by these numerical defects a tvd method employing alternating flux limiters tvdal is proposed the principle of tvdal is to alternately use a compressive and a diffusive limiter in different time steps through balancing the compression of the superbee limiter and the diffusion of other flux limiters a reduction of 60 of numerical errors in one dimensional benchmark tests can be achieved with the tvdal scheme in addition the tvdal scheme combined with the strang splitting method is proposed for multi dimensional advection for an idealized 2d experiment with oblique advection the strang splitting tvdal scheme features good shape retention with much lower numerical errors the tvdal scheme has also been applied to model tidally induced internal lee waves indicating that tvdal has the potential ability to balance the numerical compression and diffusion of conventional tvd schemes for cases with highly nonlinear stratified and nonhomogeneous flow fields finally the principles of the tvdal scheme also show the potential application to conventional high order tvd schemes keywords advection schemes tvdal compression diffusion 1 introduction

indicate how and to what extent simulated energy departs from initial pe if pe increases decreases the authors adopted diffusion compression type tvd schemes to counteract the changes in pe however in practice it is difficult to propose a universally valid indicator function for ocean modelling due to the changes to bpe caused by physical mixing in this study tvd with the alternating application of a dissuasive and compressive limiter tvdal is proposed to balance the numerical diffusion and compression issues this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the tvdal scheme the tvdal scheme is tested using one dimensional 1d and two dimensional 2d benchmark experiments in section 3 in section 4 the tvdal scheme is applied to non hydrostatic ocean modelling i e a tidally induced internal lee wave the ratios of combined limiters issues related to higher order schemes and the problem of local extrema are then discussed in section 5 finally a brief conclusion is given in section 6 2 tvd scheme and the alternating limiter 2 1 tvd scheme and flux limiters consider the 1d linear advection equation 3 c t u c x 0 where t is the time x is the spatial coordinate and c c x t is the variable advected by the constant advection speed u eq 3 can be discretized in the c grid as follows 4 c i n 1 c i n λ c i 1 2 c i 1 2 where λ u δ t δ x is the courant number in which δt is the time step and δx is the grid size as mentioned in eq 1 the superscript n and subscript i of c denote the number of time steps and grid divisions respectively c denotes the approximated c value at the interfaces of the grid the key to the advection scheme is the determination of the interface value c which is related to the tracer flux based on the first order upwind scheme and the second order lax wendroff scheme lax and wendroff 1960 sweby 1984 constructed the temporal and spatial second order tvd scheme in which c is given by eq 5 5 c i 1 2 c i n 1 2 ψ r i 1 2 1 λ c i 1 n c i n if u i 1 2 0 c

superbee tvd scheme is a compressive one whereas the others are diffusive therefore the use of an alternating limiter is proposed to balance the flux limiting i e to neutralize compression and diffusion thus the function of the limiter ψ can be constructed as 8 ψ r ψ c o m n is odd ψ d i f n is even where n is the time step and ψ com and ψ dif represent compressive and diffusive limiters respectively in practice exchanging the order of the compression and diffusion limiters has little effect on the results because a difference in a single step has a negligible effect on the total integration in this study superbee was used as the compressive limiter and was combined with different diffusive limiters which is the key concept behind the tvdal scheme applied in this study the flux limiter of the tvdal scheme is denoted by the prefix s for example s muscl represents the tvdal scheme wherein the superbee and muscl flux limiters are alternatingly used the alternating flux limiter scheme comprises two different limiter schemes and uses different limiters in various time steps therefore the efficiency of tvdal is the same as that of tvd 2 3 tvdal combined with the strang splitting method in the 2d benchmark experiment the tvdal scheme was used to resolve 2d advection 9 c t u c x v c y 0 the direct application of tvd to the 2d simulation can still induce numerical

the advection in the y direction is then calculated at the next time step the calculation order is swapped and the advection in the y direction is calculated first for the s muscl scheme the superbee flux limiter is used in the x direction whereas the muscl limiter is used in the y direction at the first step at the next time step the two flux limiters are used by alternating the directions 2 4

scheme is dissipative and diffusive if ev 0 the scheme conserves variance 3 benchmark experiments numerical experiments for idealized 1d and 2d advection were conducted to test the performances of the tvdal schemes by comparing them with the aforementioned conventional tvd schemes 3 1 1d experiment 3 1 1 experiment configuration the 1d linear moving front tests used to test the tvdal schemes are described initially a passive tracer distribution was specified in a 22 km channel three types of distributions i e trapezoidal triangular and normal distributions were used to represent normal sharp and smooth fronts respectively fig 1 in the channel a spatially homogeneous incompressible and reversing flow field u x t u sin 2 π t t existed where u is the amplitude of a reversing flow such as a tidal current and t is the period of tidal flow in the test the variables u and t were set to 0 4 m s and 12 h respectively moreover the tracer values at the two boundaries were set to zero the channel was long enough such that a non zero tracer could not reach the boundaries and the effects of the boundary conditions could be ignored assuming the initial tracer distribution is c x t 0 the analytic distribution should be c x t c x t 0 t u t d t t 0 using a lagrangian coordinate with the movement at a velocity of usin 2πt t the tracer distribution at any time should be the same as that of the initial distribution test cases with different grid spaces 100 m and 200 m and three types of time steps δt were utilized to check the advection schemes the cfl criterion maxima i e cfl u δ t δ x were 0 8 0 4 and 0 2 for the three types of time steps all of the cases were run for 200 t 3 1 2 experiment results fig 1 presents the results of the tvdal and tvd schemes for the 1d test cases for the sake of simplicity only the result of the case with δx 200m and cfl 0 4 is shown because similar results were found in other cases more detailed results are included in figs s1 s4 in the supplementary information si the results of the superbee scheme demonstrated the numerical compression the other conventional tvd schemes i e minmod van leer muscl and hsimt exhibited numerical diffusion particularly for the sharp front cases i e the triangular shape fig 1b tvdal schemes showed improved results due to the counterbalance between the compression of the superbee approach and the diffusion of the other methods in particular the nrmses for the coarse grid cases were reduced by approximately 56 fig 2 a the s minmod scheme significantly reduced the strong numerical diffusion of the minmod scheme and produced a similar result to those of the muscl and hsimt schemes although the results of the traditional van leer scheme were poor relative to muscl and hsimt the performance of the modified scheme i e s vanleer was better the results for both the s muscl and s hsimt schemes approached the analytic solution especially for the trapezoidal case fig 1a although these two tvdal schemes had slight compressions in the smooth case the compressions were significantly less than that of the superbee method and the maxima were basically maintained fig 1c the ev results could explain the improvements in the simulations when using the tvdal schemes in comparison with the tvd schemes for brevity the s muscl scheme was selected as an example for analysis as shown in fig 2b all of the evs for the superbee and muscl schemes were positive and negative respectively indicating the compression of the superbee scheme and the diffusion of the muscl scheme in the trapezoidal cases the s muscl evs were close to zero 0 01 indicating that the alternating flux limiter perfectly balanced the superbee compression and muscl diffusion therefore the simulation resulted in a substantial improvement with a reduction in nrmses for the sharp triangular cases there was excessive diffusion under the diffusive tvd schemes which indicated that superbee compression was insufficient to balance muscl diffusion using the alternating flux limiter s muscl scheme for the normal distribution cases the compression of the superbee scheme was over balanced by the diffusion of the muscl scheme which caused s muscl to be slightly compressive therefore the s muscl results for the triangular and normal distribution cases exhibited smaller improvements than for trapezoidal cases overall for all 1d test cases the nrmse of tvdal schemes was decreased by an average of 60 compared to the original tvd schemes these results suggested that advection schemes with alternating flux limiters could efficiently improve the numerical results of the original schemes by balancing numerical compression and diffusion 3 2 2d experiment 3 2 1 experimental configuration in 2d test cases oblique advection at an angle of 45 for a reversed u shaped distribution fig 3 a a slotted circular truncated cone similar to the idealized experiment by pietrzak 1998 and with a horizontal resolution of 100 m was conducted in a 30 km 30 km domain a horizontal uniform and reversing flow field with v x y t v sin 2 π t t was provided where the direction of the vector v was northeastwards and t was the period of reverse flow the variables v and t were set to 0 4 m s and 12 h respectively in all the 2d test cases as in the preceding 1d experiments the analytic distribution by advection should be the same in terms of the initial distribution at any time using the lagrangian coordinate assuming the initial tracer distribution is c x y t 0 the analytic distribution should be c x y t c x t 0 t u t d t y t 0 t v t d t t 0 simulation results at 100 s time steps over 100 t were obtained 3 2 2 experimental results for brevity only the superbee muscl and s muscl results are shown in fig 3 and others are provided in fig s5 in the si fig 3b and c clearly show that the results of 2d tvd schemes without the splitting method were strongly dispersive and cannot guarantee the non oscillatory property of the tvd scheme as reported by goodman and leveque 1985 therefore it is of critical importance to employ the splitting method for extending the 1d advection scheme to 2d the results of the superbee scheme showed the serious distortion induced by strong artificial steepening fig 3d the muscl scheme retained the peripheric circle shape of the distribution whereas its numerical diffusion resulted in mixing particularly around the bottom of the u shape fig 3e the result of the s muscl scheme accurately retained the u shape and had smaller errors than the muscl scheme although there was a slight change in shape around the inner high value fig 3f the nrmse of the s muscl scheme was reduced by 15 relative that of the hsimt scheme in addition the ev absolute value for the s muscl was only 0 01 which was greatly reduced when compared to muscl 0 14 and superbee 0 24 overall the tvdal schemes performed better than the traditional tvd schemes the nrmse of tvdal schemes decreased by an average of 24 compared to that of the original tvd schemes in the 2d case these results demonstrated that tvdal could efficiently reduce numerical error in multi dimensional cases 4 simulation of tidally induced internal lee waves in addition to the benchmark tests the tvdal schemes were also applied to model tidally induced internal waves this case featured nonlinearity strong stratification and non uniform incompressible flow fields in the horizontal 2d benchmark experiment the strang splitting method was stable because of the linearity and the spatially homogeneous flow field however realistic ocean modelling often must address inhomogeneous flow fields in such cases the strang splitting method could result in instability due to the inconstancy preserving advection problem e g leonard et al 1996 to overcome this problem tvdal in conjunction with the splitting method of pietrzak 1998 for ocean models with a σ coordinate system was applied in the marine environment research and forecast model merf developed by liu et al 2016 which was used for the test case of a tidally induced internal lee wave in the 3d model the limiter alternating sequence was x σ y y σ x x y σ σ y x y x σ and σ x y with the sequence cycles in that order according to that order the x y and σ directional calculations could occur at the first second and third sequences respectively with the same frequencies tvdal was only used for the advection of temperature other algorithms and details of the merf solution procedure were introduced in liu et al 2016 see sections 2 and 3 the model configuration and initial conditions were set according to xing and davies 2006 and berntsen et al 2009 the initial temperature linearly decreased from sea surface to sea floor and the salinity was spatially uniform and kept constant the model domain was discretized with a uniform grid spacing of 10 m in the horizontal direction and 40 uniform σ layers in the vertical direction a time step of 0 2 s was used the western open boundary of the domain was driven by an m2 tide by specifying a velocity of u 0 3sin 0 000140526t m s the experiments were performed with constant values of 10 7 m2 s for both the horizontal and vertical diffusivities as in xing and davies 2006 therefore advection played a dominant role in the transport of cold water in vortexes and temperature field variations five tvd schemes and four tvdal schemes were used for modeling temperature advection in the internal lee wave experiment all of the experiments showed that during the flood stage the flow separation near the top of the sill resulted in convective vortexes above the oscillation of the isotherms at the downstream side of the sill for brevity only the superbee muscl and s muscl results are shown in fig 4 and other results are provided in figs s6 s7 in the si the cold water temperature 11 5 c vortexes generated and propagated above 50 m water depth at the downstream side of the sill the results were consistent with those of previous modeling studies e g xing and davies 2006 the temperature distributions simulated using the different schemes at 1 4 and 1 2 of the tidal cycle are shown in fig 4 according to the superbee tvd simulation results fig 4a and b the cold water mass was transported downstream by approximately 1800 m because of its anti diffusion characteristics however the cold vertexes simulated using muscl tvd schemes did not reach as far as a result of numerical diffusion see fig 4d in fig 4 the right dashed boxes show the large differences in the modeling results within the region where x 1200 1800 m the results of the tvdal schemes revealed that the cold water in the vortexes extended to x 1200 1800 m see fig 4e f indicating that the numerical diffusion was reduced compared to the original diffusive tvd schemes the minimum water temperature mwt values in the cold vortices in the region of different schemes are shown in fig 5 a the mwt values from the compressive superbee scheme were the lowest whereas those from the diffusive scheme were relatively high tvdal which could balance the compression and diffusion had intermediate values for mwt in addition the increased potential energy ipe induced by the vertical variation in water density for the region of x 0 m was calculated using 13 i p e t g ρ t z t d v g ρ 0 z 0 d v g ρ 0 z t z 0 d v where ρ t and z t are the water potential density and the potential height respectively at moment t ρ 0 and z 0 denote the initial water potential density and potential height respectively and ρ0 is the reference density the third term on the right hand side denotes that the increase in potential energy induced by the increase of water level is removed therefore ipe is the increased potential energy due solely to the vertical variation in water density fig 5b shows the differences among the ipes for the different schemes increased with time which means that the impact of using different advection schemes on the simulation result could increase gradually at a 1 4 tidal cycle the difference between superbee and minmod reached 0 3 107 j which was 10 of the ipe 3 2 107 j on average the diffusive schemes had higher ipes due to increased diffusion which resulted in more vertical mixing the compressive superbee schemes had relatively lower ipes basically the ipes of the tvdal schemes were between those of the diffusive and superbee schemes this was consistent with the performance of tvdal in previous idealized test cases e g the ev variations shown in fig 2 because there were no analytic solutions or lab or field data it cannot be concluded which of the advection schemes produced the best results for the lee wave case but the results suggest that tvdal could balance the diffusion and compression from different tvd limiters in a similar way to that in the 1d test case therefore tvdal is a potential method for resolving the issue of numerical diffusion and compression induced by conventional tvd schemes 5 discussion 5 1 combining ratios of the compressive and diffusive limiters in the experiments above the combining ratio was 1 1 for the compressive and diffusive limiters a tvdal with a combining ratio of 1 1 probably cannot produce a maximum benefit because it may not completely counterbalance compression and diffusion due to their different strengths therefore in this section different combining ratios are tested to find the optimal ratio and evaluate the performance of tvdal with a ratio of 1 1 by comparing it with the optimal solution defining sr as the ratio of the time step number of the superbee limiter to that of a diffusive limiter the three idealized 1d test cases with different shapes introduced in section 3 1 were simulated by different tvdal schemes with different srs varying from 20 1 to 1 20 the optimal sr with a minimum nrmse and its reduction of nrmse for different tvdal schemes are listed in table 2 in most cases the optimal srs are approximately 1 1 basically from 3 1 to 1 2 except in the sharp triangle test case for which relatively strong diffusive minmod and vanleer schemes require a higher sr than in other cases however 1 1 sr can also significantly reduce the nrmses of original schemes in those two cases 35 3 and 54 2 respectively in general the optimal srs can reduce the nrmses of original schemes by an average of 67 while tvdal with 1 1 sr can achieve an average 58 nrmse reduction which is very close to the optimal sr therefore the performance of tvdal with 1 1 sr is generally acceptable and to avoid having to select sr the alternating limiter with 1 1 sr is recommended in practice in fact nrmse did not significantly decrease as sr varied from 1 1 to the optimal sr even though ev was closest to zero table 2 the reason was that the finite accuracy limited the reduction in numerical error and the numerical error could not converge with the decrease in ev in this case 5 2 comparison with high order schemes with increasing computational power high order advection schemes with less diffusion and compression have been gradually adopted in community ocean models such as the third order upwind biased scheme used in the modular ocean model mom and regional ocean modeling system roms e g griffies 2009 naughten et al 2017 and the fourth order akima and centered advection scheme implemented in roms e g naughten et al 2017 to investigate the differences between tvdal and higher order schemes the second order s muscl tvdal scheme was compared with the higher order schemes with and without limiters including a fourth order akima scheme a4s used in roms a fourth order centered scheme c4s used in roms a third order upwind scheme u3s used in roms and mom the third order hsimt scheme based on kim and kim 2005 and proposed by wu and zhu 2010 and high order upwind schemes with tvd limiters from pietrzak 1998 i e the fourth order p3 pdm according to the results of the 1d benchmark tests the nrmses of the tvdal schemes for the 1d triangle case were obviously greater than in the other two cases therefore the triangle case was adopted for comparison as shown in fig 6 s muscl tvdal outperformed the third order hsimt and u3s with an nrmse reduction of 0 11 but was inferior to the fourth order p3 pdm schemes with nrmse increases of 0 05 generally the fourth order schemes i e a4s c4s and p3 pdm produced better results than s muscl and other relatively lower order schemes in the range of 6 10 km however a4s and c4s showed 1 km long negative values due to their dispersion whereas p3 pdm was positive definite but had slightly higher 0 02 nrmse than those of a4s and c4s fig 6b it should be noted that the s muscl tvdal is of second order accuracy and costs only 50 of the cpu consumption of the fourth order schemes in addition there are some potential difficulties when applying higher order schemes in unstructured meshes due to their use of greater numbers of nodes by adding another flux limiter tvdal can be easily used or integrated into ocean models using tvd schemes without additional computations 5 3 potential of applying tvdal in high order tvd schemes according to tseng 2008 the higher order schemes could cause oscillations and overshooting under highly convective conditions resulting in unphysical effects while high order schemes with tvd limiters e g the fourth order p3 pdm in this study can eliminate unphysical effects the above results fig 6 also suggest that tvdal would be limited by the finite accuracy of the tvd limiters used hence the superbee scheme was combined with fourth order p3 pdm which has relatively less diffusion to investigate whether tvdal works for high order tvd schemes the nrmses and evs for the different srs of superbee and p3 pdm showed that the minimum nrmse was at sr 1 200 where ev was almost zero the nrmse of tvdal with sr 1 200 was 0 063 which was 11 less than that of p3 pdm 0 071 the results suggest that tvdal with an sr of 10 2 order can also improve higher order tvd schemes to some extent although the improvements will be less than those for lower order schemes this might be because the compressive limiter used in tvdal was still the second order superbee limiter which has finite accuracy replacing the superbee limiter by a higher order compressive limiter should improve higher order tvd schemes more significantly 5 4 local extrema clipping the modeling results of the 1d triangular case indicate that the tvd schemes suffer from a well known inherent drawback in that even the high order tvd schemes degrade to first order at local extrema and produce unphysical clipping at local extrema e g yang and przekwas 1992 leonard et al 1996 because r in eq 7 near the local extrema is negative or zero which means that the limiter ψ r 0 see eq 7 the tvd scheme will become a first order upwind scheme near local extrema this tvd clipping defect also influenced the fourth order p3 pdm scheme which resulted in a lower maximum fig 6a and higher nrmse fig 6b than those of the fourth order a4s and c4s schemes tvdal also suffers this defect because it does not make an intrinsic change to the tvd limiters which still equal zero at local maxima to address this problem of tvd type schemes eno weno schemes have been proposed which are not required to degrade at the local extrema e g harten et al 1987 shi et al 2002 zhang et al 2015 however eno weno schemes need a larger finite difference stencil than the traditional tvd schemes which have more computational costs and become extremely challenging in applications near ocean boundaries and on unstructured meshes e g arora and roe 1997 zhang et al 2015 this is the possible reason for the limited application of eno weno in ocean modelling 6 conclusions although tvd schemes are widely used in ocean modelling numerical errors still occur due to compression or diffusion by different flux limiters to eliminate these numerical errors tvdal is proposed the tvdal schemes were tested in 1d and 2d advection cases in the 1d test tvdal produced a smaller error than the original schemes for both the normal and sharp front cases in general tvdal can reduce nrmse by 60 in 2d cases the tvd schemes were coupled with the strang splitting method the strang splitting tvdal can better maintain advection and the tvd property which is not strictly retained by strang splitting superbee the tvdal scheme also shows an ability to balance compression and diffusion induced by tvd advection schemes for applications to simulations of tidally induced internal lee waves a case that features highly nonlinear stratified and nonhomogeneous flow fields showing the potential application of tvdal to ocean modelling under realistic conditions the test results indicate the 1 1 sr is the practical optimal strategy for combining compressive and diffusive limiters if they are of the same order in the meantime if the limiters have different orders the step ratio of higher order to lower order limiters should be adjusted accordingly acknowledgments merf has been

corresponding author 1 present address department of earth sciences national natural science foundation of china total variation diminishing tvd advection schemes are widely used in ocean modelling due to the constraints of flux limiters tvd schemes with common single flux limiters of second order or third order accuracy exhibit defects associated with numerical compression or diffusion to reduce the numerical errors induced by these numerical defects a tvd method employing alternating flux limiters tvdal is proposed the principle of tvdal is to alternately use a compressive and a diffusive limiter in different time steps through balancing the compression of the superbee limiter and the diffusion of other flux limiters a reduction of 60 of numerical errors in one dimensional benchmark tests can be achieved with the tvdal scheme in addition the tvdal scheme combined with the strang splitting method is proposed for multi dimensional advection for an idealized 2d experiment with oblique advection the strang splitting tvdal scheme features good shape retention with much lower numerical errors the tvdal scheme has also been applied to model tidally induced internal lee waves indicating that tvdal has the potential ability to balance the numerical compression and diffusion of conventional tvd schemes for cases with highly nonlinear stratified and nonhomogeneous flow fields finally the principles of the tvdal scheme also show the potential application to conventional high order tvd schemes keywords advection schemes tvdal compression diffusion 1 introduction advection is a common physical process that plays an important role in ocean modelling the choice of advection schemes has a significant influence on the simulation of ocean dynamics and mass transport e g bernard et al 2006 gerdes et al 1991 hecht et al 1998 lévy et al 2001 liu and xue 2009 mohammadi aragh et al 2015 sommer et al 2009 winther et al 2007 it is of wide interest to find an

schemes to the princeton ocean model pom which resulted in better modeling results for temperature and salinity than those of the traditional central differencing scheme the superbee scheme has also been used in dispersive surface and internal wave modeling e g shi et al 2015 liu et al 2016 mercier and delhez 2010a 2010b modified the superbee scheme for the depth integrated transport equation and

zhu 2010 developed a new spatial third order hsimt high order spatial interpolation at the middle temporal level scheme with a swebyem tvd limiter and applied it to study the changjiang river plume wu 2015 wu et al 2011 however these frequently used tvd schemes are either compressive anti diffusive or diffusive depending on the limiters used for example the superbee scheme is compressive whereas the other aforementioned tvd schemes are diffusive e g jeng and payne 1995 yang and przekwas 1992 wu and zhu 2010 naughten et al 2017 fringer et al 2005 simulated internal waves using several different tvd schemes in a completely closed domain e g a lake where the background potential energy bpe was conserved hence in idealized configurations the bpe represents an indicator that can indicate how and to what extent simulated energy departs from initial pe if pe increases decreases the authors adopted diffusion compression type tvd schemes to counteract the changes in pe however in practice it is difficult to propose a universally valid indicator function for ocean modelling due to the changes to bpe caused by physical mixing in this study tvd with the alternating application of a dissuasive and compressive limiter tvdal is proposed to balance the numerical diffusion and compression issues this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the tvdal scheme the tvdal scheme is tested using one dimensional 1d and two dimensional 2d benchmark experiments in section 3 in section 4 the tvdal scheme is applied to non hydrostatic ocean modelling i e a tidally induced internal lee wave the ratios of combined limiters issues related to higher order schemes and the problem of local extrema are then discussed in section 5 finally a brief conclusion is given in section 6 2 tvd scheme and the alternating limiter 2 1 tvd scheme and flux limiters consider the 1d linear advection equation 3 c t u c x 0 where t is the time x is the spatial coordinate and c c x t is the variable advected by the constant advection speed u eq 3 can be discretized in the c grid as follows 4 c i n 1 c i n λ c i 1 2 c i 1 2 where λ u δ t δ x is the courant number in which δt is the time step and δx is the grid size as mentioned in eq 1 the superscript n and subscript i of c denote the number of time steps and grid divisions respectively c denotes the approximated c value at the interfaces of the grid the key to the advection scheme is the determination of the interface value c which is related to the tracer flux based on the first order upwind scheme and the second order lax wendroff scheme lax and wendroff 1960 sweby 1984 constructed the temporal and spatial second order tvd scheme in which c is given by eq 5 5 c i 1 2 c i n 1 2 ψ r i 1 2 1 λ c i 1 n c i n if u i 1 2 0 c i 1 n 1 2 ψ r i 1 2 1 λ c i 1 n c i n if u i 1 2 0 where ψ is the function of the flux limiter and r denotes the ratio of the upwind gradient to the local gradient as given below 6 r i 1 2 c i n c i 1

newly proposed hsimt hsimt which is based on kim and kim s scheme kim and kim 2005 has spatial third order accuracy wu and zhu 2010 2 2 tvd with an alternating limiter tvdal according to table 1 the superbee tvd scheme is a compressive one whereas the others are diffusive therefore the use of an alternating limiter is proposed to balance the flux limiting i e to neutralize compression and diffusion thus the function of the limiter ψ can be constructed as 8 ψ r ψ c o m n is odd ψ d i f n is even where n is the time step and ψ com and ψ dif represent compressive and diffusive limiters respectively in practice exchanging the order of the compression and diffusion limiters has little effect on the results because a difference in a single step has a negligible effect on the total integration in this study superbee was used as the compressive limiter and was combined with different diffusive limiters which is the key concept behind the tvdal scheme applied in this study the flux limiter of the tvdal scheme is denoted by the prefix s for example s muscl represents the tvdal scheme wherein the superbee and muscl flux limiters are alternatingly used the alternating flux limiter scheme comprises two different limiter schemes and uses different limiters in various time steps therefore the efficiency of tvdal is the same as that of tvd 2 3 tvdal combined with the strang splitting method in the 2d benchmark experiment the tvdal scheme was used to resolve 2d advection 9 c t u c x v c y 0 the direct application of tvd to the 2d simulation can still induce numerical

construct the multi dimensional advection scheme the strang splitting method splits the two directions of eq 9 into two steps and alternates the priority order of the calculation leonard et al 1996 cushman roisin and beckers 2011 by adding the alternating flux limiters into the strang splitting method one can obtain the multi dimensional tvdal scheme and the calculation process of the strang

the advection in the y direction is then calculated at the next time step the calculation order is swapped and the advection in the y direction is calculated first for the s muscl scheme the superbee flux limiter is used in the x direction whereas the muscl limiter is used in the y direction at the first step at the next time step the two flux limiters are used by alternating the directions 2 4

tvdal schemes by comparing them with the aforementioned conventional tvd schemes 3 1 1d experiment 3 1 1 experiment configuration the 1d linear moving front tests used to test the tvdal schemes are described initially a passive tracer distribution was specified in a 22 km channel three types of distributions i e trapezoidal triangular and normal distributions were used to represent normal sharp and smooth fronts respectively fig 1 in the channel a spatially homogeneous incompressible and reversing flow field u x t u sin 2 π t t existed where u is the amplitude of a reversing flow such as a tidal current and t is the period of tidal flow in the test the variables u and t were set to 0 4 m s and 12 h respectively moreover the tracer values at the two boundaries were set to zero the channel was long enough such that a non zero tracer could not reach the boundaries and the effects of the boundary conditions could be ignored assuming the initial tracer distribution is c x t 0 the analytic distribution should be c x t c x t 0 t u t d t t 0 using a lagrangian coordinate with the movement at a velocity of usin 2πt t the tracer distribution at any time should be the same as that of the initial distribution test cases with different grid spaces 100 m and 200 m and three types of time steps δt were utilized to check the advection schemes the cfl criterion maxima i e cfl u δ t δ x were 0 8 0 4 and 0 2 for the three types of time steps all of the cases were run for 200 t 3 1 2 experiment results fig 1 presents the results of the tvdal and tvd schemes for the 1d test cases for the sake of simplicity only the result of the case with δx 200m and cfl 0 4 is shown because similar results were found in other cases more detailed results are included in figs s1 s4 in the supplementary information si the results of the superbee scheme demonstrated the numerical compression the other conventional tvd schemes i e minmod van leer muscl and hsimt exhibited numerical diffusion particularly for the sharp front cases i e the triangular shape fig 1b tvdal schemes showed improved results due to the counterbalance between the compression of the superbee approach and the diffusion of the other methods in particular the nrmses for the coarse grid cases were reduced by approximately 56 fig 2 a the s minmod scheme significantly reduced the strong numerical diffusion of the minmod scheme and produced a similar result to those of the muscl and hsimt schemes although the results of the traditional van leer scheme were poor relative to muscl and hsimt the performance of the modified scheme i e s vanleer was better the results for both the s muscl and s hsimt schemes approached the analytic solution especially for the trapezoidal case fig 1a although these two tvdal schemes had slight compressions in the smooth case the compressions were significantly less than that of the superbee method and the maxima were basically maintained fig 1c the ev results could explain the improvements in the simulations when using the tvdal schemes in comparison with the tvd schemes for brevity the s muscl scheme was selected as an example for analysis as shown in fig 2b all of the evs for the superbee and muscl schemes were positive and negative respectively indicating the compression of the superbee scheme and the diffusion of the muscl scheme in the trapezoidal cases the s muscl evs were close to zero 0 01 indicating that the alternating flux limiter perfectly balanced the superbee compression and muscl diffusion therefore the simulation resulted in a substantial improvement with a reduction in nrmses for the sharp triangular cases there was excessive diffusion under the diffusive tvd schemes which indicated that superbee compression was insufficient to balance muscl diffusion using the alternating flux limiter s muscl scheme for the normal distribution cases the compression of the superbee scheme was over balanced by the diffusion of the muscl scheme which caused s muscl to be slightly compressive therefore the s muscl results for the triangular and normal distribution cases exhibited smaller improvements than for trapezoidal cases overall for all 1d test cases the nrmse of tvdal schemes was decreased by an average of 60 compared to the original tvd schemes these results suggested that advection schemes with alternating flux limiters could efficiently improve the numerical results of the original schemes by balancing numerical compression and diffusion 3 2 2d experiment 3 2 1 experimental configuration in 2d test cases oblique advection at an angle of 45 for a reversed u shaped distribution fig 3 a a slotted circular truncated cone similar to the idealized experiment by pietrzak 1998 and with a horizontal resolution of 100 m was conducted in a 30 km 30 km domain a horizontal uniform and reversing flow field with v x y t v sin 2 π t t was provided where the direction of the vector v was northeastwards and t was the period of reverse flow the variables v and t were set to 0 4 m s and 12 h respectively in all the 2d test cases as in the preceding 1d experiments the analytic distribution by advection should be the same in terms of the initial distribution at any time using the lagrangian coordinate assuming the initial tracer distribution is c x y t 0 the analytic distribution should be c x y t c x t 0 t u t d t y t 0 t v t d t t 0 simulation results at 100 s time steps over 100 t were obtained 3 2 2 experimental results for brevity only the superbee muscl and s muscl results are shown in fig 3 and others are provided in fig s5 in the si fig 3b and c clearly show that the results of 2d tvd schemes without the splitting method were strongly dispersive and cannot guarantee the non oscillatory property of the tvd scheme as reported by goodman and leveque 1985 therefore it is of critical importance to employ the splitting method for extending the 1d advection scheme to 2d the results of the superbee scheme showed the serious distortion induced by strong artificial steepening fig 3d the muscl scheme retained the peripheric circle shape of the distribution whereas its numerical diffusion resulted in mixing particularly around the bottom of the u shape fig 3e the result of the s muscl scheme accurately retained the u shape and had smaller errors than the muscl scheme although there was a slight change in shape around the inner high value fig 3f the nrmse of the s muscl scheme was reduced by 15 relative that of the hsimt scheme in addition the ev absolute value for the s muscl was only 0 01 which was greatly reduced when compared to muscl 0 14 and superbee 0 24 overall the tvdal schemes performed better than the traditional tvd schemes the nrmse of tvdal schemes decreased by an average of 24 compared to that of the original tvd schemes in the 2d case these results demonstrated that tvdal could efficiently reduce numerical error in multi dimensional cases 4 simulation of tidally induced internal lee waves in addition to the benchmark tests the tvdal schemes were also applied to model tidally induced internal waves this case featured nonlinearity strong stratification and non uniform incompressible flow fields in the horizontal 2d benchmark experiment the strang splitting method was stable because of the linearity and the spatially homogeneous flow field however realistic ocean modelling often must address inhomogeneous flow fields in such cases the strang splitting method could result in instability due to the inconstancy preserving advection problem e g leonard et al 1996 to overcome this problem tvdal in conjunction with the splitting method of pietrzak 1998 for ocean models with a σ coordinate system was applied in the marine environment research and forecast model merf developed by liu et al 2016 which was used for the test case of a tidally induced internal lee wave in the 3d model the limiter alternating sequence was x σ y y σ x x y σ σ y x y x σ and σ x y with the sequence cycles in that order according to that order the x y and σ directional calculations could occur at the first second and third sequences respectively with the same frequencies tvdal was only used for the advection of temperature other algorithms and details of the merf solution procedure were introduced in liu et al 2016 see sections 2 and 3 the model configuration and initial conditions were set according to xing and davies 2006 and berntsen et al 2009 the initial temperature linearly decreased from sea surface to sea floor and the salinity was spatially uniform and kept constant the model domain was discretized with a uniform grid spacing of 10 m in the horizontal direction and 40 uniform σ layers in the vertical direction a time step of 0 2 s was used the western open boundary of the domain was driven by an m2 tide by specifying a velocity of u 0 3sin 0 000140526t m s the experiments were performed with constant values of 10 7 m2 s for both the horizontal and vertical diffusivities as in xing and davies 2006 therefore advection played a dominant role in the transport of cold water in vortexes and temperature field variations five tvd schemes and four tvdal schemes were used for modeling temperature advection in the internal lee wave experiment all of the experiments showed that during the flood stage the flow separation near the top of the sill resulted in convective vortexes above the oscillation of the isotherms at the downstream side of the sill for brevity only the superbee muscl and s muscl results are shown in fig 4 and other results are provided in figs s6 s7 in the si the cold water temperature 11 5 c vortexes generated and propagated above 50 m water depth at the downstream side of the sill the results were consistent with those of previous modeling studies e g xing and davies 2006 the temperature distributions simulated using the different schemes at 1 4 and 1 2 of the tidal cycle are shown in fig 4 according to the superbee tvd simulation results fig 4a and b the cold water mass was transported downstream by approximately 1800 m because of its anti diffusion characteristics however the cold vertexes simulated using muscl tvd schemes did not reach as far as a result of numerical diffusion see fig 4d in fig 4 the right dashed boxes show the large differences in the modeling results within the region where x 1200 1800 m the results of the tvdal schemes revealed that the cold water in the vortexes extended to x 1200 1800 m see fig 4e f indicating that the numerical diffusion was reduced compared to the original diffusive tvd schemes the minimum water temperature mwt values in the cold vortices in the region of different schemes are shown in fig 5 a the mwt values from the compressive superbee scheme were the lowest whereas those from the diffusive scheme were relatively high tvdal which could balance the compression and diffusion had intermediate values for mwt in addition the increased potential energy ipe induced by the vertical variation in water density for the region of x 0 m was calculated using 13 i p e t g ρ t z t d v g ρ 0 z 0 d v g ρ 0 z t z 0 d v where ρ t and z t are the water potential density and the potential height respectively at moment t ρ 0 and z 0 denote the initial water potential density and potential height respectively and ρ0 is the reference density the third term on the right hand side denotes that the increase in potential energy induced by the increase of water level is removed therefore ipe is the increased potential energy due solely to the vertical variation in water density fig 5b shows the differences among the ipes for the different schemes increased with time which means that the impact of using different advection schemes on the simulation result could increase gradually at a 1 4 tidal cycle the difference between superbee and minmod reached 0 3 107 j which was 10 of the ipe 3 2 107 j on average the diffusive schemes had higher ipes due to increased diffusion which resulted in more vertical mixing the compressive superbee schemes had relatively lower ipes basically the ipes of the tvdal schemes were between those of the diffusive and superbee schemes this was consistent with the performance of tvdal in previous idealized test cases e g the ev variations shown in fig 2 because there were no analytic solutions or lab or field data it cannot be concluded which of the advection schemes produced the best results for the lee wave case but the results suggest that tvdal could balance the diffusion and compression from different tvd limiters in a similar way to that in the 1d test case therefore tvdal is a potential method for resolving the issue of numerical diffusion and compression induced by conventional tvd schemes 5 discussion 5 1 combining ratios of the compressive and diffusive limiters in the experiments above the combining ratio was 1 1 for the compressive and diffusive limiters a tvdal with a combining ratio of 1 1 probably cannot produce a maximum benefit because it may not completely counterbalance compression and diffusion due to their different strengths therefore in this section different combining ratios are tested to find the optimal ratio and evaluate the performance of tvdal with a ratio of 1 1 by comparing it with the optimal solution defining sr as the ratio of the time step number of the superbee limiter to that of a diffusive limiter the three idealized 1d test cases with different shapes introduced in section 3 1 were simulated by different tvdal schemes with different srs varying from 20 1 to 1 20 the optimal sr with a minimum nrmse and its reduction of nrmse for different tvdal schemes are listed in table 2 in most cases the optimal srs are approximately 1 1 basically from 3 1 to 1 2 except in the sharp triangle test case for which relatively strong diffusive minmod and vanleer schemes require a higher sr than in other cases however 1 1 sr can also significantly reduce the nrmses of original schemes in those two cases 35 3 and 54 2 respectively in general the optimal srs can reduce the nrmses of original schemes by an average of 67 while tvdal with 1 1 sr can achieve an average 58 nrmse reduction which is very close to the optimal sr therefore the performance of tvdal with 1 1 sr is generally acceptable and to avoid having to select sr the alternating limiter with 1 1 sr is recommended in practice in fact nrmse did not significantly decrease as sr varied from 1 1 to the optimal sr even though ev was closest to zero table 2 the reason was that the finite accuracy limited the reduction in numerical error and the numerical error could not converge with the decrease in ev in this case 5 2 comparison with high order schemes with increasing computational power high order advection schemes with less diffusion and compression have been gradually adopted in community ocean models such as the third order upwind biased scheme used in the modular ocean model mom and regional ocean modeling system roms e g griffies 2009 naughten et al 2017 and the fourth order akima and centered advection scheme implemented in roms e g naughten et al 2017 to investigate the differences between tvdal and higher order schemes the second order s muscl tvdal scheme was compared with the higher order schemes with and without limiters including a fourth order akima scheme a4s used in roms a fourth order centered scheme c4s used in roms a third order upwind scheme u3s used in roms and mom the third order hsimt scheme based on kim and kim 2005 and proposed by wu and zhu 2010 and high order upwind schemes with tvd limiters from pietrzak 1998 i e the fourth order p3 pdm according to the results of the 1d benchmark tests the nrmses of the tvdal schemes for the 1d triangle case were obviously greater than in the other two cases therefore the triangle case was adopted for comparison as shown in fig 6 s muscl tvdal outperformed the third order hsimt and u3s with an nrmse reduction of 0 11 but was inferior to the fourth order p3 pdm schemes with nrmse increases of 0 05 generally the fourth order schemes i e a4s c4s and p3 pdm produced better results than s muscl and other relatively lower order schemes in the range of 6 10 km however a4s and c4s showed 1 km long negative values due to their dispersion whereas p3 pdm was positive definite but had slightly higher 0 02 nrmse than those of a4s and c4s fig 6b it should be noted that the s muscl tvdal is of second order accuracy and costs only 50 of the cpu consumption of the fourth order schemes in addition there are some potential difficulties when applying higher order schemes in unstructured meshes due to their use of greater numbers of nodes by adding another flux limiter tvdal can be easily used or integrated into ocean models using tvd schemes without additional computations 5 3 potential of applying tvdal in high order tvd schemes according to tseng 2008 the higher order schemes could cause oscillations and overshooting under highly convective conditions resulting in unphysical effects while high order schemes with tvd limiters e g the fourth order p3 pdm in this study can eliminate unphysical effects the above results fig 6 also suggest that tvdal would be limited by the finite accuracy of the tvd limiters used hence the superbee scheme was combined with fourth order p3 pdm which has relatively less diffusion to investigate whether tvdal works for high order tvd schemes the nrmses and evs for the different srs of superbee and p3 pdm showed that the minimum nrmse was at sr 1 200 where ev was almost zero the nrmse of tvdal with sr 1 200 was 0 063 which was 11 less than that of p3 pdm 0 071 the results suggest that tvdal with an sr of 10 2 order can also improve higher order tvd schemes to some extent although the improvements will be less than those for lower order schemes this might be because the compressive limiter used in tvdal was still the second order superbee limiter which has finite accuracy replacing the superbee limiter by a higher order compressive limiter should improve higher order tvd schemes more significantly 5 4 local extrema clipping the modeling results of the 1d triangular case indicate that the tvd schemes suffer from a well known inherent drawback in that even the high order tvd schemes degrade to first order at local extrema and produce unphysical clipping at local extrema e g yang and przekwas 1992 leonard et al 1996 because r in eq 7 near the local extrema is negative or zero which means that the limiter ψ r 0 see eq 7 the tvd scheme will become a first order upwind scheme near local extrema this tvd clipping defect also influenced the fourth order p3 pdm scheme which resulted in a lower maximum fig 6a and higher nrmse fig 6b than those of the fourth order a4s and c4s schemes tvdal also suffers this defect because it does not make an intrinsic change to the tvd limiters which still equal zero at local maxima to address this problem of tvd type schemes eno weno schemes have been proposed which are not required to degrade at the local extrema e g harten et al 1987 shi et al 2002 zhang et al 2015 however eno weno schemes need a larger finite difference stencil than the traditional tvd schemes which have more computational costs and become extremely challenging in applications near ocean boundaries and on unstructured meshes e g arora and roe 1997 zhang et al 2015 this is the possible reason for the limited application of eno weno in ocean modelling 6 conclusions although tvd schemes are widely used in ocean modelling numerical errors still occur due to compression or diffusion by different flux limiters to eliminate these numerical errors tvdal is proposed the tvdal schemes were tested in 1d and 2d advection cases in the 1d test tvdal produced a smaller error than the original schemes for both the normal and sharp front cases in general tvdal can reduce nrmse by 60 in 2d cases the tvd schemes were coupled with the strang splitting method the strang splitting tvdal can better maintain advection and the tvd property which is not strictly retained by strang splitting superbee the tvdal scheme also shows an ability to balance compression and diffusion induced by tvd advection schemes for applications to simulations of tidally induced internal lee waves a case that features highly nonlinear stratified and nonhomogeneous flow fields showing the potential application of tvdal to ocean modelling under realistic conditions the test results indicate the 1 1 sr is the practical optimal strategy for combining compressive and diffusive limiters if they are of the same order in the meantime if the limiters have different orders the step ratio of higher order to lower order limiters should be adjusted accordingly acknowledgments merf has been

24057,the tyrrhenian circulation driven by the interplay of transport at its main straits and local climate presents a marked seasonal variability in this work we investigate the role of the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric fields in the long term seasonal variability of the tyrrhenian sea circulation we adopt the eddy permitting ocean circulation model nemo med12 simulations cover the 1997 2008 period and are driven by atmospheric fields from promes regional climate model with a horizontal resolution of 50 km and 25 km given that this is the first time that promes variables have been used to run ocean simulations we first evaluate the overall performance of this setup taking into consideration the entire model domain which covers the whole mediterranean sea we show that promes variables allow a good representation of the mediterranean boundary fluxes and water masses focusing on the tyrrhenian sea the comparison of the model results to altimeter data shows that the main features of the seasonal variability of the tyrrhenian large scale circulation are well captured regardless of the resolution of the atmospheric fields however the prescription of 25 km resolution atmospheric fields improves substantially the representation of the dynamical structures resolved by the model based on our results we update intermediate depth circulation patterns very little studied so far we show that changes observed with 25 km fields are not due to a better simulation of transport across corsica sardinia and sicily straits but rather to the improved representation of winds keywords mediterranean sea tyrrhenian sea regional ocean model seasonal circulation patterns atmospheric resolution 1 introduction the mediterranean sea is a semi enclosed basin which is connected to the black sea through the marmara bosphorus system and to the atlantic ocean via the narrow and shallow strait of gibraltar 14 km width 300 m depth the mediterranean landlocked configuration is exacerbated by the strait of sicily which communicates the so called eastern and western mediterranean fig 1 on annual basis the mediterranean is subjected to negative surface heat and freshwater budgets see jordà et al 2017 for a recent review surface buoyancy loss entailed by enhanced winter cooling drives open sea convection which fuels the mediterranean thermohaline circulation bergamasco and malanotte rizzoli 2010 convection occurs at specific sites of the eastern and western mediterranean basins and triggers the formation of distinct water masses with typical hydrographic properties skliris 2014 schematically atlantic water aw enters the mediterranean basin at shallow levels above the strait of gibraltar and flows into the eastern mediterranean via the sicily strait in the levantine sub basin intense heat loss and evaporation during winter causes surface waters to sink to intermediate depths 150 350 m to form the so called levantine intermediate water liw wüst 1961 lascaratos et al 1993 liwex group 2003 liw flows westward below the upper aw increases the salt content at shallow depths and preconditions surface waters for deep water formation medoc group 1970 wu and haines 1996 in the western mediterranean the tyrrhenian stands out for its complex geometry and bathymetry fig 1 the tyrrhenian water column features aw at the surface liw at intermediate depths and tyrrhenian deep water tdw at depth astraldi et al 2002 vetrano et al 2004 aw and liw enter and exit the sub basin through three openings which are crucial for the water mass exchange between the different mediterranean sub basins the strait of sicily the corsica channel and the sardinia channel fig 1 water exchange through these straits together with local atmospheric forcing over the tyrrhenian gives place to a complex circulation pattern which features a marked seasonal variability e g krivosheya and ovchinnikov 1973 korres et al 2000 over the last decades observations and numerical models pointed to a winter large scale surface circulation pattern consisting of a basin scale along slope cyclonic stream fed by the entrance of aw from the south of the sub basin krivosheya and ovchinnikov 1973 artale et al 1994 roussenov et al 1995 zavatarelli and mellor 1995 whereas most of the aw completes the cyclonic path around the tyrrhenian and flows out through sardinia channel part of it continues to the north via the corsica channel and flows into the liguro provençal sub basin and then into the gulf of lions to form the northern current andré et al 2005 in summer the described large scale circulation pattern does not arise and water transport across the corsica channel becomes limited artale et al 1994 vignudelli et al 1999 gasparini et al 2008 the presence of several permanent or quasi permanent and recurrent structures has been reported for decades for instance two permanent cyclonic structures to the northeast and southeast of sardinia are well known features of this sub basin moen 1984 astraldi and gasparini 1994 in recent years the analysis of quality checked satellite images and results from eddy permitting ocean general circulation models among others has revealed that mesoscale processes are of great importance in this sub basin especially in summer béranger et al 2004 rio et al 2007 rinaldi et al 2010 vetrano et al 2010 iacono et al 2013 napolitano et al 2014 new mesoscale structures have been encountered and the seasonal variability of surface circulation patterns has been refined iacono et al 2013 napolitano et al 2014 jouini et al 2016 whereas the seasonal evolution of the tyrrhenian surface circulation is relatively well characterised intermediate depth circulation patterns are still poorly constrained observations are scarce and geostrophic circulation patterns currently used as reference were already proposed in the early 1970s by krivosheya and ovchinnikov 1973 on the basis of hydrographic datasets and in situ measurements the work by krivosheya and ovchinnikov 1973 is one of the most complete reconstructions of the intermediate depth circulation of the tyrrhenian sea available to date only a few high resolution ocean regional circulation models orcms have been applied to address liw circulation within the tyrrhenian vetrano et al 2010 napolitano et al 2014 in these works the simulated time period is not longer than a year and this proves too short to determine whether observed seasonal circulation patterns which often deviate from the reconstructions of krivosheya and ovchinnikov 1973 are representative of the long term seasonal variability or not in this context the application of orcms to perform high resolution hindcast simulations integrated over a sufficiently long time period would constitute an excellent way to achieve a more complete understanding into the most robust features of the seasonal variability of liw circulation over this sub basin in ocean only and coupled ocean atmosphere simulations applied to the study of the oceanography of the mediterranean sea and or its sub basins atmospheric fields often have a horizontal resolution of 50 km see www medcordex eu whereas the use of higher resolution atmospheric grids is generally advised this entails important computational costs that are often not affordable especially in long hindcast simulations or climate projections several modelling works have shown that the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric forcing plays an important role in the representation of the ocean circulation in the nw mediterranean for instance herrmann and somot 2008 find that a horizontal resolution of 50 km is required to reproduce deep convection in the nw mediterranean sea this they argue relates to the increase of meteorological extremes with higher resolution atmospheric fields béranger et al 2010 show that the prescription of higher resolution atmospheric fields allows orographic wind funnelling that intensifies the gyre circulation in the nw mediterranean and favours preconditioning for deep convection events the purpose of this work is to study the effect of increasing the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric fields from 50 km to 25 km on the seasonal variability of the tyrrhenian circulation although the system may be subjected to interannual variations we only tackle the long term seasonal variability in order to concentrate exclusively on robust circulation features this allows us i to assess the ability of state of the art hindcast simulations to reproduce the long term seasonal variability of the tyrrhenian surface circulation ii to gain physics based insight into the very little studied tyrrhenian intermediate depth circulation and use the model results to update previously proposed circulation schemes and iii to study circulation changes in response to an increase of the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric fields and analyse the mechanisms that cause them specifically we investigate whether these are driven by an improvement of the strait transport at the openings of the tyrrhenian sea and or by changes in the regional distribution of the atmospheric fields to that end we use the eddy permitting ocean circulation model nemo med12 which includes the whole mediterranean sea simulations cover the 1997 2008 period and are driven by atmospheric fields obtained from the atmospheric regional climate model arcm promes domínguez et al 2013 nested in era interim reanalysis promes fields here used for the first time to run ocean simulations have been evaluated regarding the surface heat and water budgets for the mediterranean sea showing rather good results in comparison with other arcms sánchez gómez et al 2011 this work constitutes an initial effort towards the achievement of a coupled promes nemo med12 configuration this manuscript is structured as follows in section 2 the model setup is described in section 3 we briefly evaluate the adequate overall performing of this newly developed setup on the mediterranean basin scale in section 4 the role of the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric fields in the tyrrhenian surface and intermediate depth circulation is tackled in section 5 we discuss the effects of the atmospheric data resolution on water properties as well as the causal mechanism responsible for the circulation changes observed with higher resolution atmospheric fields a summary of the most relevant findings and some concluding remarks are presented in section

30 n to 46 n respectively see fig 1s of the supplementary material this is roughly equivalent to a resolution ranging from 6 5 km and 8 km in latitude and from 5 5 km and 7 5 km in longitude see beuvier et al 2012a for details over the mediterranean sea the first rossby radius of deformation takes values between 10 km and 15 km being only smaller than 10 km in weakly stratified coastal regions whereas the horizontal grid is finer than the rossby radius almost everywhere in the mediterranean sea nemo med12 reproduces explicitly processes with a horizontal scale 5 times greater than its horizontal resolution meaning structures with a typical horizontal scale of about 40 km or larger this resolution is sufficient to resolve the most prominent mesoscale structures of the tyrrhenian sub basin most of them with characteristic length scales greater than 100 km iacono et al 2013 in this work we only address the representation of dynamical structures which are fully resolved by the model on the vertical the model has 75 z levels with partial steps unevenly spaced the thickness of the shallowest and deepest model levels are 1 m and 134 m respectively to simulate the mediterranean atlantic exchange a buffer area is implemented over the atlantic portion of the domain within the buffer zone which extends from 11 e to 6 e a three dimensional restoration of potential temperature and salinity towards monthly means of temperature and salinity from the interannual database oras 4 balmaseda et al 2013 is performed to avoid sharp temperature and salinity contrasts between the atlantic and the mediterranean sea the relaxation coefficient varies towards the east from 2 days to 90 days respectively to guarantee water volume conservation sea surface height within the buffer zone is restored towards monthly means of sea surface height from oras 4 the relaxation coefficient ranges from west to east from 2 s to 90 days river runoff and black sea input are specified as a surface discharge at river mouths following the methodology explained in beuvier et al 2012a atmospheric variables used to run the model derive from two previous simulations performed with the atmosphere regional climate model promes domínguez et al 2013 nested in era interim and carried out as part of medcordex rcm intercomparison project ruti et al 2016 this is the first time that promes fields are used to drive ocean simulations promes fields have a horizontal resolution of 50 km and 25 km and are available at a frequency of 3 or 6 h depending on the specific variable air sea interactions are parameterised with bulk formulas which have been extensively applied to study the oceanography of the mediterranean sea e g nittis et al 2003 oddo et al 2005 tonani et al 2008 napolitano et al 2016 these bulk formulas use atmospheric data from promes and the modelled sea surface temperature to compute the solar and non solar components of the heat flux the evaporation rate and the wind stress we use the mediterranean forecast system bulk formulation developed by castellari et al 1998 available in nemo required atmospheric variables are sea level pressure pa total precipitation kg m2 s 2 m air temperature k 2 m dew point temperature k total cloud cover and zonal and meridional components of the 10 m wind m s specifically i the solar radiation is computed using reed 1977 formula ii the net longwave radiation is calculated following bignami et al 1995 iii drag coefficients used to compute wind stress are calculated according to hellerman and rosenstein 1983 and iv the latent and sensible heat fluxes are computed with classical bulk formulas parameterised as in kondo 1975 to avoid a drift in salinity the freshwater flux balance between evaporation precipitation river discharge and black sea input i e e p r b is corrected this correction is computed from the relaxation of the model sea surface salinity towards the sea surface salinity of the medatlas ii climatology medar medatlas group 2002 the restoration coefficient is set to 166 67 mm day psu madec et al 2008 freshwater flux is not corrected at river mouths with bulk formulation the modelled sea surface temperature is used to calculate the surface heat flux and hence a correction of the sea surface temperature is not required starting from an ocean at rest an 8 year spin up spanning from the 1st of january 1989 to the 31st of december 1996 is performed mediterranean initial conditions for potential temperature and salinity derive from the winter state of the medatlas ii climatology medar medatlas group 2002 the atlantic portion of the domain is initialised with monthly means of temperature and salinity from the interannual climatology oras 4 balmaseda et al 2013 for the spin up atmospheric variables from promes with a horizontal resolution of 50 km are used after the spin up two companion simulations are run differing only in the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric fields pr50 50 km resolution and pr25 25 km resolution both simulations extend from the 1st of january 1997 to the 31st of december 2008 3 mediterranean boundary fluxes and water masses prior to the examination of the tyrrhenian sub basin circulation as this is the first time that promes fields are used to drive an oceanic configuration over the mediterranean sea we ensure the overall performance of this new model setup on the mediterranean basin scale to do so we concentrate on diagnostics the representation of which is crucial to adequately reproduce the oceanography of the mediterranean sea for the simulation time period e g beuvier et al 2010 specifically we review the air sea fluxes computed from promes fields and the simulated fluxes across the strait of gibraltar we use those fluxes to quantify the mediterranean heat salt and water budgets the closure of which is essential to avoid temperature and salinity drifts as to the ocean we address the interannual variations of the basin scale heat and salt contents which indicate the ability of this setup to simulate the distinct mediterranean water masses for brevity and because it has been found to be representative of both runs this validation is done with results obtained from the simulation driven by pr50 fields 3 1 air sea fluxes here we evaluate the monthly averaged seasonal cycle of the surface heat flux w m2 and the surface freshwater flux m yr for the simulation period 1997 2008 we compare promes fluxes computed as explained in section 2 to air sea fluxes calculated from variables obtained from observational datasets the methodology adopted for the construction of the observational curves presented in fig 2 a and b is described in the supplementary material a summary of the annual mean values reported in section 3 as well as the annual mean estimates obtained in previous works is offered in table 1 the seasonal cycle of the heat flux given by the addition of the longwave radiation shortwave radiation latent and sensible heat fluxes is presented in fig 2a in which a positive sign indicates that the ocean gains heat from the atmosphere the surface heat flux derived from promes reproduces well qualitatively and quantitatively the seasonal variability from the observational curves but is slightly lower than observations in winter and above them in summer the computed heat flux is positive from march to september with a summer maximum of 171 99 w m2 the heat flux is negative the rest of the year and presents a minimum of 209 02 w m2 in december on average we find an annual mean net surface heat flux of 5 48 w m2 with an interannual standard deviation of 5 06 w m2 this average and its associated deviation are within the dataset range and are in line with heat flux reconstructions from observational products and from model studies table 1 the surface freshwater flux given by the balance between evaporation precipitation runoff and black sea input is presented in fig 2b in which a positive sign indicates that evaporation exceeds freshwater inputs promes simulates reasonably well the seasonal variability of the net water flux from march to september promes freshwater flux takes values slightly lower than those computed from observational products to understand this small mismatch it is important to recall that the medatlas ii climatology used to compute the freshwater flux correction extends until 2002 the simulated time period is therefore only partially covered the freshwater flux attains a minimum of 0 06 m yr in may and a maximum of 1 02 m yr in september on annual mean this has a value of 0 59 0 05 m yr as observed in table 1 this is slightly smaller than the means we compute from observational products and is closer to the upper limit of values derived from observational datasets in sánchez gómez et al 2011 the blue discontinuous line in fig 2b displays the mean value of the freshwater flux correction for the whole simulation time period the computed correction is 0 14 m yr the negative sign indicates that on average this correction lowers the net evaporation through the addition of water 3 2 transport at gibraltar the monthly averaged seasonal cycle of the water transport via the strait of gibraltar is presented in fig 2c and d values are given in sv 1 sv 106 m3 s and a positive sign points to transport from the atlantic into the mediterranean observational data concerning the water transport at gibraltar are sparse and a continuous record spanning over the simulated time period is not available to evaluate the computed transports we turn to existing literature water transport at the strait of gibraltar composed by atlantic inflow into the mediterranean at the surface and mediterranean outflow into the atlantic over the lower portion of the strait is subjected to a marked seasonal variability mediterranean outflow presents a minimum of 0 64 sv in february and a maximum of 0 78 sv in may giving a seasonal amplitude of 0 14 sv fig 2c a similar timing for the seasonal cycle has been found in observational studies with maximum and minimum outflow volumes positioned in spring and late fall winter respectively candela 2001 soto navarro et al 2010 atlantic inflow peaks at 0 80 sv in july and has a minimum value close to 0 66 sv in february resulting in a seasonal amplitude of 0 14 sv fig 2d the monthly averaged cycle for the inflow is also in good agreement with previous works which report maximum inflow volumes in summer and minimum transport in winter bryden et al 1994 garcía lafuente et al 2002 soto navarro et al 2010 for the atlantic inflow and the mediterranean outflow we find annual means of 0 75 0 02 sv and 0 70 0 02 sv respectively these are close to the lower limit of values based on direct measurements at the strait of gibraltar which vary between estimates from bryden et al 1994 and candela 2001 presented in table 1 as for the water transport the heat and salt transports at this strait are positive when these are directed towards the mediterranean for the net heat transport across gibraltar we find an annual mean of 5 88 0 36 w m2 the atlantic is a heat source for the mediterranean and this is well captured by the model as observed in table 1 our estimate is close to the reconstruction of macdonald et al 1994 from in situ measurements of water temperature and current velocity across this strait and shows a very good agreement with the ensemble average of harzallah et al 2016 for the salt transport at gibraltar we calculate 0 002 psu yr which is an intermediate value between the annual mean salt transports found in the regional simulations of beuvier et al 2010 and sevault et al 2014 3 3 water heat and salt budgets water volume conservation implied by a closed water budget requires the net surface water flux to equal the net water transport across gibraltar in our simulation both components have an annual mean value of about 0 05 sv and the water budget is therefore well closed table 1 as in previous model studies we assume that the heat budget is closed when the imbalance between the net heat gained via gibraltar and the net heat lost to the atmosphere equals the mediterranean heat content trend the latter corresponds to the temperature change from the first to the last year of the simulation divided by the total amount of years considered in the simulated period as stated above the net heat transport at gibraltar and the net surface heat flux are 5 88 0 36 w m2 and 5 48 5 06 w m2 respectively for the mediterranean heat content trend we compute 0 005 c yr which equals 1 w m2 the addition of the three components heat transport through the mediterranean surface heat transport through gibraltar and heat content trend is 0 6 w m2 and the budget is nearly closed the mediterranean does not gain or lose salt through the air sea interface and the salt budget is thus closed when the salt transport at gibraltar equals the mediterranean salt content trend both terms are 0 002 psu yr and the salt budget is balanced 3 4 heat and salt contents fig 3 shows annual series of potential temperature c and salinity psu computed from our model results in this figure annual means from the en4 climatology good et al 2013 and the interannual gridded dataset of rixen et al 2005 are also presented following rixen et al 2005 we calculate annual means for the entire mediterranean basin fig 3a and b as well as for several depth ranges fig 3c h the first layer extends from the sea surface to 150 m and serves to characterise hydrographic properties of the aw fig 3c and d the second one ranges from 150 to 600 m and allows us to evaluate intermediate waters namely liw fig 3e and f the third one is found from 600 m to the seafloor and is filled with deep waters fig 3g and h overall the model captures well the interannual variability of the mediterranean basin average temperature fig 3a for the simulation time period computed temperature is qualitatively and quantitatively close to climatological values with a small warm bias 0 1 c in comparison to en4 which is not larger than that presented in previous model studies in the upper layer temperature exhibits a good agreement with both climatologies temperature estimates are close to those from en4 and lay within the uncertainty associated to rixen et al 2005 climatology fig 3c intermediate waters still present a distinct interannual variability and annual means of simulated temperature resemble observational estimates fig 3e temperature of intermediate depth waters is about 0 1 c warmer than that of the en4 climatology all over the simulation period the warm bias encountered for intermediate depth waters exhibits a similar magnitude as that found on the mediterranean basin scale fig 3a this is an indication that intermediate depth waters are playing a role in the overall warming of the mediterranean basin in the deep basin interannual variations are weak and temperature mainly shows a small but progressive increase with time fig 3g this notwithstanding simulated temperature estimates are relatively close to observed values and the increase we find is not larger than that reported in previous model studies mediterranean average salinity is relatively well represented for the simulated period and presents a small salty bias that does not exceed 0 02 psu relative to en4 fig 3b in line with previous model studies e g l hévéder et al 2013 simulated interannual variations of salinity have a smaller amplitude than in the climatologies in the upper and intermediate layers annual means of salinity are mostly in the range of uncertainty associated to the climatology of rixen et al 2005 fig 3d and f as for temperature interannual variations of simulated salinity become less pronounced with depth and from 600 m to the seafloor these are almost absent fig 3h we can conclude that the model setup we present is able to adequately represent the mediterranean air sea fluxes the water transport across the strait of gibraltar and the interannual variability of the different mediterranean water masses the biases we report are not larger than those presented in previous studies see e g beuvier et al 2010 2012b l hévéder et al 2013 sevault et al 2014 harzallah et al 2016 water heat and salt budgets are nearly closed and thus the stability of the run is ensured 4 ocean behaviour in the tyrrhenian sub basin in this section we study the seasonal surface and intermediate depth circulation patterns derived from the simulations driven by pr50 and by pr25 to evaluate whether the prescription of pr50 or pr25 improves the representation of the surface circulation the obtained surface patterns are put against geostrophic velocity fields derived from altimeter data the obtained intermediate depth circulation patterns are compared to available literature 4 1 surface circulation over the tyrrhenian sea aw figs 4 and 5 illustrate seasonal averages of salinity and flow trajectories computed from the simulations driven by pr50 and pr25 at a depth of 55 m for the 1997 2008 period this depth is chosen because this is below the frictional ekman layer and allows us to concentrate on geostrophic features in these figures seasonal averages of geostrophic flow trajectories deduced from copernicus marine environment monitoring system cmems altimeter data for the simulated time period are also presented cmems provides multimission altimeter gridded sea surface heights and derived variables over the mediterranean sea with a horizontal resolution of 1 8 1 8 www marine copernicus eu cmems data indicates the presence of four dynamical coherent structures numbered consistently from 1 to 4 as well as some seasonal structures numbered 5 and 6 in winter in agreement with altimeter data and previous modelling and observational works the large scale circulation pattern that emerges from the simulations conducted with pr50 and pr25 fields points to a strong basin wide cyclonic stream around the sub basin fig 4a c see e g krivosheya and ovchinnikov 1973 artale et al 1994 fresh aw enters the tyrrhenian through the sardinia channel flows along slope to the easternmost sub basin and continues to the northwest until about 10 e and 42 n from there part of the flow moves to the north via the corsica channel while part of it flows to the south parallel to the coasts of corsica and sardinia until about 10 e and 39 n from the latter area water exits the sub basin through the sardinia channel or repeats the described path cyclonic structures 1 and 2 develop to the southeast and to the northeast of sardinia respectively these have been identified as permanent or quasi permanent features philippe and harang 1982 artale et al 1994 rio et al 2007 rinaldi et al 2010 vetrano et al 2010 iacono et al 2013 napolitano et al 2014 the northern one is the so called bonifacio gyre and the southern one with a more complex geometry can be regarded as a wide recirculation area connected to other smaller scale structures as remarked by rinaldi et al 2010 although both structures are reproduced with pr50 and pr25 fields they achieve a greater size and are bounded by faster currents with pr25 hence in better agreement with data the prescription of higher resolution atmospheric fields therefore improves the representation of these structures in cmems data a relatively small anticyclonic centre labelled as 3 is found to the southeast of 2 while it is missing in the simulation carried out with pr50 fields it arises in the simulation driven by pr25 fields flow trajectories from altimeter data also show a prominent anticyclonic centre positioned between 12 e 13 e to which we refer as 4 this has been reported in former observational studies as a permanent circulation feature budillon et al 2009 rinaldi et al 2010 with pr50 fields this structure is absent and a flow meander is found instead however when atmospheric fields with 25 km resolution are prescribed structure 4 is correctly reproduced in spring the general circulation pattern is similar to that in winter with some minor changes fig 4d f a general decrease of mean seasonal current velocities encompassed with an increasing number of the resolved dynamical structures is observed this notwithstanding the along slope cyclonic stream bordering the sub basin found in winter is still clearly displayed cyclonic structures 1 and 2 arise with both atmospheric collections but are better simulated with pr25 for the reasons listed above as in the previous season anticyclonic structures 3 and 4 the latter weaker than in winter are only captured with pr25 in contrast with winter flow along the northern coast of sicily exhibits more meanders and eddies arise over the continental shelf from about 13 e over the region labelled as 5 northwestward flow parallel to the italian coast appears shifted to the west and small eddies develop especially to the east of it the seaward displacement of this stream has also been found in the high resolution numerical simulations of napolitano et al 2014 for spring 2009 in summer the basin scale circulation pattern exhibits remarkable differences relative to winter and spring fig 5a c the previously described basin wide cyclonic circulation scheme breaks down and a great amount of dynamical structures are simulated this has also been reported in former model and observational studies in which the basin scale cyclonic stream has been found to be a winter feature e g artale et al 1994 iacono et al 2013 cyclonic structures 1 and 2 are reproduced with both pr50 and pr25 but the intensification and increase of the zonal extent of structure 2 that emerges from altimeter data in summer is particularly well represented in the simulation driven by pr25 in summer 2 and 3 intensify and get attached allowing the clear visualisation of the so called bonifacio dipole krivosheya and ovchinnikov 1973 astraldi and gasparini 1994 rinaldi et al 2010 with pr50 atmospheric data velocities are small at the expected location of eddy 3 and no well defined anticyclonic centre can be identified on the contrary with pr25 structure 3 which was found in all previous seasons with these fields intensifies substantially and the bonifacio dipole is clearly depicted as to anticyclone 4 current velocities are small and none of the two atmospheric collections tested are able to reproduce enclosed eddies besides the commented structures eddies 5 and 6 stand out as robust summer features anticyclonic eddy 5 forms over the northern coast of sicily this which has also been reported in iacono et al 2013 and napolitano et al 2014 hampers the development of northward flow parallel to the italian coast with pr25 anticyclonic centre 5 becomes less intense more elongated on the zonal direction and achieves a geometry that resembles more that of the corresponding structure from cmems data to the north of 5 a smaller and less intense anticyclone labelled as 6 is found with pr25 atmospheric fields currents that border this eddy intensify improving its representation compared to the case in which pr50 fields are used in line with previous works our results support that the appearance of anticyclonic dynamical structures to the east of the sub basin reverses the flow direction along the italian coast which becomes prevailingly southwards iacono et al 2013 napolitano et al 2014 northward transport through the corsica channel seems too weak or interrupted in fall flow velocities over the southern and eastern flanks of the tyrrhenian increase their magnitude and northward flow along the italian coast and through corsica channel are restored fig 5d f a cyclonic stream around the sub basin is not fully developed yet the resolved mesoscale activity decreases relative to summer but it is still more important than in winter cyclonic structures 1 and 2 are intense and as in summer 2 shows a remarkable increase of its zonal extension in comparison to winter and spring in agreement with altimeter data with pr25 fields anticyclone 3 is depicted and the bonifacio dipole is still visible the dipole does not arise with pr50 exceptionally anticyclonic centre 4 is found with pr50 but a pronounced flow meander arises with pr25 instead from the analysis above we can conclude that the main features of the seasonal variability of the surface large scale circulation are well captured regardless of the resolution of the atmospheric conditions imposed the prescription of pr25 however leads to an improved representation of the most robust and prominent dynamical structures resolved by the model 4 2 intermediate circulation over the tyrrhenian sea liw figs 6 and 7 display seasonal averages of salinity and flow trajectories computed from the simulations driven by pr50 and pr25 at a depth of 400 m for the 1997 2008 period this is the depth of maximum salinity representative of the liw core in both figures the approximate position at which the main surface flow structures were found at shallow levels is indicated with an arrow the structures are numbered as in figs 4 and 5 at this depth currents are slower than at shallower levels note the different arrow scaling in figs 4 7 liw enters the tyrrhenian via the strait of sicily travels to the east and at about 12 5 e and 38 5 n coinciding with a bathymetric anomaly flow bifurcates into two distinct branches regardless of the season one to the east and one to the west the branch that flows to the west reaches the westernmost sub basin through a variable route set by different smaller scale structures and exits the sub basin from the sardinia channel at this channel side by side circulation found at shallow depths is replaced by one directional flow in winter liw enters the tyrrhenian and flows cyclonically along slope around the sub basin fig 6a and b in contrast to what was found at shallower levels from 12 e and 41 n part of the northwestward flow parallel to the italian coast deflects towards the southwest following topographic contours until 10 5 e and 40 n in menna and poulain 2010 mediterranean intermediate circulation for the 2003 2010 period is reconstructed using argo profiling floats in spite of the low resolution of argo data 1 1 the described southwestward water branch obtained in our simulations stands out as a robust flow feature from the latter location flow continues to the south parallel to the coastlines of corsica and sardinia and exits the sub basin at sardinia channel as in former works some of the structures found at shallower levels are detectable at intermediate depths vetrano et al 2010 napolitano et al 2014 with pr50 fields the outer contour that defines cyclonic area 1 is still visible at this depth when pr25 fields are prescribed the outer contour of 1 as well as the geometry of structures 2 and 4 are clearly depicted transition from winter to spring entails similar changes to those found at shallower depths fig 6c and d essentially the winter circulation pattern remains but current velocities decrease northward flow along the coast of italy is slightly shifted to the west and small eddies develop to the east of this stream the large scale pattern we report is in agreement with results from the high resolution numerical simulation of vetrano et al 2010 in which a cyclonic stream around the sub basin accompanied by a flow branch crossing from about 12 e and 41 n to 10 5 e and 40 n is found for spring 2004 the flow configuration we report contradicts napolitano et al 2014 in which the flow vein that crosses the sub basin from east to west is absent and southward flow parallel to the italian coast is found for april 2009 this could indicate that april 2009 is not representative of the mean state of the intermediate spring circulation and highlights the necessity of longer simulations to assess robust seasonal circulation patterns with pr50 and pr25 structures 1 and 2 can still be traced at this depth structures 3 and 4 which appeared with pr25 at shallow depths bounded by currents weaker than in winter are not visible at 400 m in summer as for shallow levels the overall winter and spring circulation scheme does not develop and a greater number of dynamical structures resolved is detected fig 7a and b cyclonic flow around the sub basin does not extend further north than about 41 n where waters deflect to the west the northernmost sub basin appears disconnected from the rest in contrast to what occurs at the surface flow parallel to italy does not reverse direction and is still prevailingly northward in summer with pr50 fields the outer contour of structure 1 and the signature of eddy 5 on salinity are visible with pr25 structures 1 2 3 and 5 are found in fall a transition towards the winter circulation starts fig 7c and d currents intensify and dynamical structures become less abundant eastward flow parallel to the sicilian coast extends further to the east whereas most of the flow that moves along the italian coast deflects from 41 n to the west part of it also continues to the north and completes the longer cyclonic route typical from winter and spring whilst with pr50 fields only the external contour of structure 1 is visible in the simulation driven by pr25 structures 1 2 and 3 are represented as for shallow depths the main features of the seasonal variability of the large scale intermediate depth circulation is well captured with 50 km or 25 km resolution fields but a greater amount of smaller structures is simulated with 25 km atmospheric fields overall the simulated basin scale patterns and their seasonal variability show a good agreement with the schemes proposed by krivosheya and ovchinnikov 1973 on the basis of composite hydrographic datasets the fact that the most intense structures found at the surface appear at intermediate depths reflects the barotropic nature of the flow e g vetrano et al 2010 our results highlight that for a given season a greater amount of the surface dynamical structures appear at 400 m with pr25 fields figs 4 7 a relevant insight that arises from section 4 1 is that the prescription of pr25 with some exceptions i e summer anticyclonic eddy 5 generally intensifies surface dynamical structures this intensification which is supported by the regional distribution of the sea surface height see fig 2s of the supplementary material and the accompanying text causes a greater amount of the surface structures to be visible at this depth the resolved liw mesoscale variability that cannot be explained by barotropic impact may be related to baroclinic instabilities associated with the energetic cyclonic current that borders the sub basin or part of it see escudier et al 2016 5 discussion in section 5 1 we investigate the effect of the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric data on water properties in section 5 2 we examine whether the improved representation of the dynamical structures observed with pr25 is driven by changes of the transport at the major tyrrhenian straits or rather by the regional distribution of atmospheric fields 5 1 effect of the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric fields on water properties at a depth of 55 m aw reaches the westernmost end of sicily with a salinity not higher than 37 7 psu regardless of the season figs 4 and 5 salinity increases within the tyrrhenian due to en route evaporation results from the model study of napolitano et al 2014 indicate that aw salinity is maximum to the west of the sub basin especially inside cyclone 2 where vertical mixing with underlying salty waters occurs in line with that study we also find an overall salinity increase to the west and maximum values within structure 2 from this location salty waters are exported to different areas of the sub basin namely to the south the improved simulation of dynamical structures with pr25 fields has a concomitant effect on salinity distribution this can be checked over the northern tyrrhenian sub basin where in winter salinities close to 38 2 psu are found over a more extensive area with pr25 this is caused by the improved simulation of cyclonic structure 2 which is stronger and more enclosed with pr25 than with pr50 fig 4b and c changes in the representation of structure 2 also have an impact on the regional distribution of the sea surface temperature which is lower and achieves values more consistent with observational data inside it with pr25 fields see fig 3s of the supplementary material and the corresponding text the latter result stresses the relevance of an adequate resolution of atmospheric models in coupled atmosphere ocean models in order to achieve a correct heat distribution over the sea surface which is a primary driver of atmospheric processes at a depth of 400 m liw enters the tyrrhenian with a salinity close to 38 8 psu figs 6 and 7 salinity is maximum close to the strait of sicily where liw flows into the sub basin at this location liw is up to 0 025 psu saltier when pr25 fields are prescribed compared to pr50 fields this must be related to processes that occur out of the tyrrhenian sub basin namely over the eastern mediterranean where liw is produced and transported up to the sicily strait from the entrance area liw salinity decreases gradually towards the sardinia channel due to en route mixing with surrounding fresher waters contrary to what happens at shallow levels salinity decreases from east to west 5 2 what is needed for an improved representation of the resolved dynamical structures with pr25 5 2 1 seasonal variability of the water transport at the tyrrhenian sea straits fig 8 shows the monthly averaged seasonal cycle of water transport at sardinia a corsica b and sicily c straits obtained from the simulations driven by pr50 and pr25 for the 1997 2008 period positive velocities indicate eastward transport at sardinia northward flow at corsica and southeastward transport at sicily for the calculations the interface between the different water masses is defined as follows aw liw interface is defined by a density of 28 9 e g vetrano et al 2004 2010 napolitano et al 2014 at sardinia channel the interface between liw and tdw is set to 29 1 vetrano et al 2010 we observe that for a given strait transports of the different water masses obtained with pr50 and pr25 are almost identical this finding is in line with results presented in section 4 which indicate that the seasonal variability of the tyrrhenian large scale circulation does not change to a large extent when higher resolution atmospheric fields are prescribed in all cases transports of aw and liw are maximum in late fall winter and minimum in summer gasparini et al 2008 a summary of the maximum minimum and average liw and aw transports for each of these traits is offered in table 2 winter and summer cross sections of salinity and velocity at the examined straits are presented and described in fig 4s of the supplementary material and the corresponding text in fig 4s the resulting position of the interfaces between the different water masses assuming the above described criteria is also depicted at sardinia channel the seasonal cycle is fundamentally modulated by the transport of aw fig 8a net water transport which results from the addition of the transports of aw liw and tdw yields annual means of 0 37 sv with pr50 and 0 36 sv with pr25 in line with vetrano et al 2010 at corsica channel in agreement with observations from gasparini et al 2008 water transport is mainly composed by aw and a minor volume of liw fig 8b we compute an annual mean net water transport of 0 34 sv and 0 33 sv with pr50 and pr25 fields respectively data obtained from mooring and ctd measurements at corsica channel from 1985 to 2005 indicate an annual mean net water transport of 0 49 sv gasparini et al 2008 the latter value can be considered close to our estimates especially taking into account that in gasparini et al 2008 the greatest transport occurs in the 1980 s decade which is not included within the time period we simulate at the strait of sicily the calculated annual mean liw transports are 0 63 sv and 0 64 sv with pr50 and pr25 fields respectively these are within the lower range of available values e g moretti et al 1993 but are smaller than 1 sv the annual mean liw transport found in gasparini et al 2008 for the 1993 2006 period computed transports are adequately reproduced and differences in response to the use of pr50 or pr25 fields are minor the improved simulation of the resolved dynamical structures with pr25 is thus not linked to a better representation of the strait transport and may be associated with changes in the spatial distribution of the atmospheric fields this aspect is tackled in the next section 5 2 2 winds and ocean circulation figs 9 a f show winter and summer averages of wind direction and wind speed in m s computed for the 1997 2008 period making use of pr50 and pr25 fields in this figure seasonal averages of wind velocity derived from the cross calibrated multi platform ccmp dataset for the simulation time period are also presented ccmp gridded dataset combines cross calibrated satellite winds obtained from remote sensing systems remss and provides winds with a horizontal resolution of 0 25 0 25 atlas et al 2011 in this figure black discontinuous contours indicate the outer edge of the corresponding surface structures numbered as in figs 4 and 5 in all seasons ccmp winds are highest in the areas adjacent to sardinia and sicily straits fig 9a and d wind intensification within this region appears better represented with pr25 fig 9c and f winds from pr50 reach maximum speeds which are always about 0 5 m s lower than in the ccmp dataset with pr25 winds attain maximum speeds close to 8 m s in winter and 6 m s in summer both values in agreement with ccmp data ccmp winds are also particularly intense to the east of the bonifacio strait located close to 9 e 41 n fig 1 which is unfortunately not contemplated in this database in winter ccmp data indicates the existence of a zonally oriented wind tongue characterised by maximum speeds of about 7 m s the development of this structure may be driven by funnelling of westerlies through the bonifacio strait which is a very well documented phenomena see gérigny et al 2015 and references therein focusing on promes fields we observe that wind funnelling through the bonifacio strait is only resolved in pr25 wind intensification due to wind channelling enhances wind speeds to the east of the strait reaching locally up to 7 5 m s in pr50 wind velocities are about 0 5 m s lower than in pr25 in summer ccmp winds also exhibit a remarkable intensification over this area where velocities attain up to 5 5 m s different to winter in summer orographic wind funnelling occurs in both pr50 and pr25 datasets this notwithstanding wind intensification is more pronounced in pr25 whereas pr50 winds achieve maximum speeds close to 5 m s pr25 winds reach maximum values of about 6 m s it is worth to point out that with pr25 regardless of the season cyclonic structure 2 positions over the areas where wind speed is high ccmp winds indicate a slackening to the southeast of the tyrrhenian sub basin where wind speeds are low over this area the regional distribution of winds differs substantially depending on the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric fields to the north of sicily at about 14 e ccmp winds are not higher than 5 5 m s 6 5 m s in winter and 3 5 m s 4 5 m s in summer in all seasons pr50 winds are about 0 5 m s greater than in ccmp while pr25 winds have almost the same magnitude as in ccmp winds from ccmp also show a remarkable velocity gradient around this area and this is better reproduced with pr25 overall in line with our results an improved simulation of winds near the coastlines with higher resolution atmospheric fields due to a better representation of land sea gradients has also been found in previous model studies obermann et al 2016 akhtar et al 2017 to establish a link between the wind representation and the ocean circulation we now study the mean wind work at play in the tyrrhenian sub basin wunsch 1998 renault et al 2016 we examine winter and summer averages of wind work for the simulations driven by pr50 fig 10 a and c and pr25 fig 10b and d in this figure the outer contours of the corresponding surface structures are also superimposed to compute the mean wind work we adopt the following expression wind work 1 ρ o τ x u o τ y v o where ρo is the density of sea water assumed 1020 kg m3 τx and τy the zonal and meridional components of the wind stress in n m2 and uo and vo the zonal and meridional components of the ocean current velocities averaged from the surface to a depth of 55 m in m s in this expression the overbars indicate long term seasonal averages estimated for the 1997 2008 period computed from daily means see renault et al 2016 the wind work represents the exchange of kinetic energy between the atmosphere and the ocean and a positive sign indicates that both winds and ocean currents move along the same direction and therefore that wind provides kinetic energy to the ocean a negative sign on the contrary entails that winds reduce the ocean s kinetic energy in this figure positive and negative side by side values should be interpreted to indicate either the presence of an eddy water recirculation or wind gradients as to the large scale spatial distribution of the wind work it is greatest in absolute value over the near shore region regardless of the horizontal resolution of atmospheric fields in winter the wind work is positive over the western and southern boundaries of the sub basin and negative along the eastern tyrrhenian coast fig 10a and b in this season as concluded in section 4 1 a cyclonic stream that borders the sub basin develops this drives northwestward flow along the eastern coast of the tyrrhenian which moves against winds namely from the west or the northwest in summer the basin scale cyclonic circulation vanishes and so does the described regional distribution of the wind work in more detail in all seasons wind injects larger amounts of kinetic energy through the western rim of cyclonic structure 2 in the simulation driven by pr25 fields this is in line with the previously reported intensification of winds in response to orographic funnelling through the bonifacio strait with pr25 also the regions over which the wind work enhances along the boundary of cyclone 2 appear more extensive in the simulation performed with pr25 especially in summer the improved representation of structure 2 with pr25 fields which entails an increase of its size and an intensification of its associated currents see figs 4c f and 5c f can be thus clearly linked to wind activity this result supports findings from previous studies in which the wind driven nature of this structure is highlighted moen 1984 in the regional model study of béranger et al 2010 the authors report that an increase of the atmospheric forcing resolution allows orographic wind channelling which contributes to the maintenance of a vigorous cyclonic gyre circulation in the gulf of lions based on the study of the regional distribution of the summer relative vorticity ζ for the 1997 2008 period we compute the areas enclosed by the outermost contour that defines structure 2 with pr50 and pr25 assuming a contour interval of 6 10 7 1 s the surface area of cyclone 2 increases from 2 13 109 m2 with pr50 to 8 48 109 m2 with pr25 fields the computed areas correspond to equivalent radius of 26 07 km and 51 96 km respectively eddy 3 which is particularly developed in summer and is only clearly reproduced in the simulation driven by pr25 is under the influence of westerlies channelled via the bonifacio strait see fig 9 in summer with pr50 fields the wind work over the area where eddy 3 would be expected is rather small and it does not emerge with pr25 kinetic energy provided by the wind along its northern boundary enhances and this may favour its appearance the improved representation of winds through the bonifacio strait is therefore responsible for the better simulation of structures 2 and 3 allowing the development of the summer bonifacio dipole with pr25 other structures that are affected by wind representation are anticyclones 5 and 6 both arise regardless of the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric fields and constitute robust summer features as to structure 5 with pr25 the wind work over its northeastern boundary decreases and the area over which wind injects kinetic energy has a more elongated geometry relative to the simulation driven by pr50 this is consistent with the improved representation of the wind velocity gradients over this region due to wind slackening with pr25 the slowdown of eddy 5 observed with pr25 consistent with cmems geostrophic velocities is thus in agreement with the observed changes in the wind activity to the north of 5 anticyclone 6 arises with pr25 eddy 6 slightly intensifies and this structure together with eddy 5 form a summer dipole which is not so well represented with pr50 to further assess the role of local winds in the improvements observed in the tyrrhenian circulation with higher resolution atmospheric fields we now examine summer time series of wind stress curl a and eddy kinetic energy eke computed making use of daily means of ocean velocity as well as the mean ocean currents for the 1997 2008 period b over the tyrrhenian sub basin fig 11 this analysis concentrates on the summer season because the winter circulation pattern is prone to aw stream instabilities rather than local atmospheric forcing as shown by iacono et al 2013 furthermore in summer the improved representation of dynamical structures is more remarkable than in other seasons overall in the simulations driven by pr25 fields wind stress curl and eke present higher values than with pr50 fields thus in better agreement with observational data the correlation coefficient between simulated and ccmp wind stress curl increases from 0 63 with pr50 to 0 70 with pr25 fields wind stress curl mean biases for the simulation time period decrease from 4 91 10 8 n m3 with pr50 to 3 64 10 9 n m3 with pr25 in agreement with former modelling studies performed with nemo med12 e g beuvier et al 2012a simulated eke levels are lower than those from cmems this notwithstanding the prescription of higher resolution atmospheric fields improves substantially its representation the correlation coefficient between simulated and cmems eke takes values smaller than 0 10 with pr50 and 0 56 with pr25 fields also mean biases decrease in magnitude from 15 08 cm2 s2 with pr50 to 7 21 cm2 s2 with pr25 fields fig 11 also shows that high low values of wind stress curl often coincide in time with an increase decrease of the eke levels the correlation coefficient between the wind stress curl from ccmp and the simulated eke is greater than 0 50 regardless of the atmospheric field resolution although there may be different factors controlling changes in the eke wind stress curl is clearly at play 6 summary and conclusions this work is dedicated to the study of the role of the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric fields in the long term seasonal variability of the tyrrhenian sea circulation to that end we adopt the eddy permitting ocean circulation model nemo med12 which is a mediterranean configuration of nemo and high resolution atmospheric fields from promes regional climate model nested in era interim we examine two companion simulations that cover the 1997 2008 period and only differ in the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric fields which is 50 km pr50 or 25 km pr25 because promes fields are here used for the first time to simulate the oceanography of the mediterranean sea the overall performance of this novel setup is examined prior to the study of the tyrrhenian sea circulation we show that the presented configuration reproduces conveniently the seasonal cycle of the mediterranean air sea fluxes and the transports across the strait of gibraltar the interannual variability of the distinct mediterranean water masses is relatively well simulated and the biases we report are not larger than those found in previous studies the most relevant findings extracted from the examination of the tyrrhenian circulation the primary focus of this study with this particular configuration are the seasonal variability of the tyrrhenian basin scale circulation is well captured with pr50 or pr25 but the representation of the resolved dynamical structures is improved with pr25 fields in line with cmems geostrophic velocities the winter and spring large scale surface circulation patterns are characterised by a broad cyclonic stream around the sub basin which does not arise in summer and fall regardless of the resolution of the atmospheric fields the prescription of pr25 improves the geometry position and velocity of the simulated ocean dynamical structures at shallow levels intermediate depth circulation patterns from the simulations driven by pr50 and pr25 fields for winter spring and summer fall respectively show a good agreement with schemes from krivosheya and ovchinnikov 1973 in winter and spring most liw flows cyclonically around the tyrrhenian and only a minor part of it crosses the sub basin from about 12 e and 41 n to 10 5 e and 40 n in summer and fall most liw deflects to the southwest and the northern domain of the sub basin becomes isolated only the most prominent surface flow structures are found at intermediate depths the use of pr25 fields generally intensifies them and therefore a greater amount of the surface eddies gyres and meanders are reproduced with pr25 at a depth of 400 m the presence or absence of structures such as gyres and eddies as well as their geometry and velocity exert a first order control in the regional distribution of salt and heat in coupled atmosphere ocean models it is advisable that atmospheric grids have a resolution greater than 50 km in order to achieve a correct distribution of heat over the sea surface which is a primary driver of atmospheric processes for uncoupled ocean simulations not focused on mesoscale size processes atmospheric fields with 50 km would seem sufficient improvements in the simulation of the most robust dynamical structures with pr25 are not linked to changes in the transport across sardinia corsica and sicily straits but rather relates to the better simulation of winds changes in the regional distribution of the wind work explain to a large extent the improved representation of the dynamical structures observed in the simulation driven by pr25 in view of our results we can conclude that although there is room improvements the overall performance of the presented model setup is quite satisfactory because conclusions drawn could be to some extent model dependent future work will potentially include a multimodel analysis in the frame of medcordex this will allow us to get insight into the consistency of results obtained with promes atmospheric data and results derived from other model configurations an interesting follow up of this work could include a quantification of the eddy wind work the barotropic conversion from mean kinetic energy to eke and the transformation from eddy potential energy to eke a current effort is being done to achieve a promes nemo med12

24057,the tyrrhenian circulation driven by the interplay of transport at its main straits and local climate presents a marked seasonal variability in this work we investigate the role of the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric fields in the long term seasonal variability of the tyrrhenian sea circulation we adopt the eddy permitting ocean circulation model nemo med12 simulations cover the 1997 2008 period and are driven by atmospheric fields from promes regional climate model with a horizontal resolution of 50 km and 25 km given that this is the first time that promes variables have been used to run ocean simulations we first evaluate the overall performance of this setup taking into consideration the entire model domain which covers the whole mediterranean sea we show that promes variables allow a good representation of the mediterranean boundary fluxes and water masses focusing on the tyrrhenian sea the comparison of the model results to altimeter data shows that the main features of the seasonal variability of the tyrrhenian large scale circulation are well captured regardless of the resolution of the atmospheric fields however the prescription of 25 km resolution atmospheric fields improves substantially the representation of the dynamical structures resolved by the model based on our results we update intermediate depth circulation patterns very little studied so far we show that changes observed with 25 km fields are not due to a better simulation of transport across corsica sardinia and sicily straits but rather to the improved representation of winds keywords mediterranean sea tyrrhenian sea regional ocean model seasonal circulation patterns atmospheric resolution 1 introduction the mediterranean sea is a semi enclosed basin which is connected to the black sea through the marmara bosphorus system and to the atlantic ocean via the narrow and shallow strait of gibraltar 14 km width 300 m depth the mediterranean landlocked configuration is exacerbated by the strait of sicily which communicates the so called eastern and western mediterranean fig 1 on annual basis the mediterranean is subjected to negative surface heat and freshwater budgets see jordà et al 2017 for a recent review surface buoyancy loss entailed by enhanced winter cooling drives open sea convection which fuels the mediterranean thermohaline circulation bergamasco and malanotte rizzoli 2010 convection occurs at specific sites of the eastern and western mediterranean basins and triggers the formation of distinct water masses with typical hydrographic properties skliris 2014 schematically atlantic water aw enters the mediterranean basin at shallow levels above the strait of gibraltar and flows into the eastern mediterranean via the sicily strait in the levantine sub basin intense heat loss and evaporation during winter causes surface waters to sink to intermediate depths 150 350 m to form the so called levantine intermediate water liw wüst 1961 lascaratos et al 1993 liwex group 2003 liw flows westward below the upper aw increases the salt content at shallow depths and preconditions surface waters for deep water formation medoc group 1970 wu and haines 1996 in the western mediterranean the tyrrhenian stands out for its complex geometry and bathymetry fig 1 the tyrrhenian water column features aw at the surface liw at intermediate depths and tyrrhenian deep water tdw at depth astraldi et al 2002 vetrano et al 2004 aw and liw enter and exit the sub basin through three openings which are crucial for the water mass exchange between the different mediterranean sub basins the strait of sicily the corsica channel and the sardinia channel fig 1 water exchange through these straits together with local atmospheric forcing over the tyrrhenian gives place to a complex circulation pattern which features a marked seasonal variability e g krivosheya and ovchinnikov 1973 korres et al 2000 over the last decades observations and numerical models pointed to a winter large scale surface circulation pattern consisting of a basin scale along slope cyclonic stream fed by the entrance of aw from the south of the sub basin krivosheya and ovchinnikov 1973 artale et al 1994 roussenov et al 1995 zavatarelli and mellor 1995 whereas most of the aw completes the cyclonic path around the tyrrhenian and flows out through sardinia channel part of it continues to the north via the corsica channel and flows into the liguro provençal sub basin and then into the gulf of lions to form the northern current andré et al 2005 in summer the described large scale circulation pattern does not arise and water transport across the corsica channel becomes limited artale et al 1994 vignudelli et al 1999 gasparini et al 2008 the presence of several permanent or quasi permanent and recurrent structures has been reported for decades for instance two permanent cyclonic structures to the northeast and southeast of sardinia are well known features of this sub basin moen 1984 astraldi and gasparini 1994 in recent years the analysis of quality checked satellite images and results from eddy permitting ocean general circulation models among others has revealed that mesoscale processes are of great importance in this sub basin especially in summer béranger et al 2004 rio et al 2007 rinaldi et al 2010 vetrano et al 2010 iacono et al 2013 napolitano et al 2014 new mesoscale structures have been encountered and the seasonal variability of surface circulation patterns has been refined iacono et al 2013 napolitano et al 2014 jouini et al 2016 whereas the seasonal evolution of the tyrrhenian surface circulation is relatively well characterised intermediate depth circulation patterns are still poorly constrained observations are scarce and geostrophic circulation patterns currently used as reference were already proposed in the early 1970s by krivosheya and ovchinnikov 1973 on the basis of hydrographic datasets and in situ measurements the work by krivosheya and ovchinnikov 1973 is one of the most complete reconstructions of the intermediate depth circulation of the tyrrhenian sea available to date only a few high resolution ocean regional circulation models orcms have been applied to address liw circulation within the tyrrhenian vetrano et al 2010 napolitano et al 2014 in these works the simulated time period is not longer than a year and this proves too short to determine whether observed seasonal circulation patterns which often deviate from the reconstructions of krivosheya and ovchinnikov 1973 are representative of the long term seasonal variability or not in this context the application of orcms to perform high resolution hindcast simulations integrated over a sufficiently long time period would constitute an excellent way to achieve a more complete understanding into the most robust features of the seasonal variability of liw circulation over this sub basin in ocean only and coupled ocean atmosphere simulations applied to the study of the oceanography of the mediterranean sea and or its sub basins atmospheric fields often have a horizontal resolution of 50 km see www medcordex eu whereas the use of higher resolution atmospheric grids is generally advised this entails important computational costs that are often not affordable especially in long hindcast simulations or climate projections several modelling works have shown that the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric forcing plays an important role in the representation of the ocean circulation in the nw mediterranean for instance herrmann and somot 2008 find that a horizontal resolution of 50 km is required to reproduce deep convection in the nw mediterranean sea this they argue relates to the increase of meteorological extremes with higher resolution atmospheric fields béranger et al 2010 show that the prescription of higher resolution atmospheric fields allows orographic wind funnelling that intensifies the gyre circulation in the nw mediterranean and favours preconditioning for deep convection events the purpose of this work is to study the effect of increasing the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric fields from 50 km to 25 km on the seasonal variability of the tyrrhenian circulation although the system may be subjected to interannual variations we only tackle the long term seasonal variability in order to concentrate exclusively on robust circulation features this allows us i to assess the ability of state of the art hindcast simulations to reproduce the long term seasonal variability of the tyrrhenian surface circulation ii to gain physics based insight into the very little studied tyrrhenian intermediate depth circulation and use the model results to update previously proposed circulation schemes and iii to study circulation changes in response to an increase of the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric fields and analyse the mechanisms that cause them specifically we investigate whether these are driven by an improvement of the strait transport at the openings of the tyrrhenian sea and or by changes in the regional distribution of the atmospheric fields to that end we use the eddy permitting ocean circulation model nemo med12 which includes the whole mediterranean sea simulations cover the 1997 2008 period and are driven by atmospheric fields obtained from the atmospheric regional climate model arcm promes domínguez et al 2013 nested in era interim reanalysis promes fields here used for the first time to run ocean simulations have been evaluated regarding the surface heat and water budgets for the mediterranean sea showing rather good results in comparison with other arcms sánchez gómez et al 2011 this work constitutes an initial effort towards the achievement of a coupled promes nemo med12 configuration this manuscript is structured as follows in section 2 the model setup is described in section 3 we briefly evaluate the adequate overall performing of this newly developed setup on the mediterranean basin scale in section 4 the role of the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric fields in the tyrrhenian surface and intermediate depth circulation is tackled in section 5 we discuss the effects of the atmospheric data resolution on water properties as well as the causal mechanism responsible for the circulation changes observed with higher resolution atmospheric fields a summary of the most relevant findings and some concluding remarks are presented in section 6 2 model setup in this analysis we use nemo med12 which is a mediterranean configuration of the nucleus for european modelling of the ocean nemo v3 2 madec et al 2008 nemo med12 has been formerly adopted to study the large scale and the mesoscale circulation of the mediterranean sea beuvier et al 2012a escudier et al 2016 nemo is a primitive equation finite difference hydrostatic free surface eddy permitting three dimensional ocean model in nemo med12 the horizontal viscosity coefficient for the dynamics i e velocity is set to 1 25 1010 m4 s2 and is applied with a bi laplacian operator the horizontal eddy diffusivity coefficient for tracers i e temperature and salinity has a value of 60 m2 s and is prescribed with a laplacian operator a 1 5 turbulent closure scheme is adopted for the vertical eddy diffusivity blanke and delecluse 1993 whereas tracer advection is specified with the total variance dissipation scheme bottom friction is parameterised by a quadratic function and a filtered free surface formulation is used roullet and madec 2000 solar radiation can penetrate the sea surface bozec et al 2008 the timestep is set to 12 min the bathymetry adopted has a constant resolution of 30 30 and derives from the 10th version of the mercator legos bathymetry fig 1 the horizontal grid is extracted from a global standard three polar orca grid at 1 12 stretched towards a pole located in central russia the other two poles are placed in antarctica and north canada the grid presents a non uniform horizontal resolution which varies approximately between 1 14 and 1 18 from 30 n to 46 n respectively see fig 1s of the supplementary material this is roughly equivalent to a resolution ranging from 6 5 km and 8 km in latitude and from 5 5 km and 7 5 km in longitude see beuvier et al 2012a for details over the mediterranean sea the first rossby radius of deformation takes values between 10 km and 15 km being only smaller than 10 km in weakly stratified coastal regions whereas the horizontal grid is finer than the rossby radius almost everywhere in the mediterranean sea nemo med12 reproduces explicitly processes with a horizontal scale 5 times greater than its horizontal resolution meaning structures with a typical horizontal scale of about 40 km or larger this resolution is sufficient to resolve the most prominent mesoscale structures of the tyrrhenian sub basin most of them with characteristic length scales greater than 100 km iacono et al 2013 in this work we only address the representation of dynamical structures which are fully resolved by the model on the vertical the model has 75 z levels with partial steps unevenly spaced the thickness of the shallowest and deepest model levels are 1 m and 134 m respectively to simulate the mediterranean atlantic exchange a buffer area is implemented over the atlantic portion of the domain within the buffer zone which extends from 11 e to 6 e a three dimensional restoration of potential temperature and salinity towards monthly means of temperature and salinity from the interannual database oras 4 balmaseda et al 2013 is performed to avoid sharp temperature and salinity contrasts between the atlantic and the mediterranean sea the relaxation coefficient varies towards the east from 2 days to 90 days respectively to guarantee water volume conservation sea surface height within the buffer zone is restored towards monthly means of sea surface height from oras 4 the relaxation coefficient ranges from west to east from 2 s to 90 days river runoff and black sea input are specified as a surface discharge at river mouths following the methodology explained in beuvier et al 2012a atmospheric variables used to run the model derive from two previous simulations performed with the atmosphere regional climate model promes domínguez et al 2013 nested in era interim and carried out as part of medcordex rcm intercomparison project ruti et al 2016 this is the first time that promes fields are used to drive ocean simulations promes fields have a horizontal resolution of 50 km and 25 km and are available at a frequency of 3 or 6 h depending on the specific variable air sea interactions are parameterised with bulk formulas which have been extensively applied to study the oceanography of the mediterranean sea e g nittis et al 2003 oddo et al 2005 tonani et al 2008 napolitano et al 2016 these bulk formulas use atmospheric data from promes and the modelled sea surface temperature to compute the solar and non solar components of the heat flux the evaporation rate and the wind stress we use the mediterranean forecast system bulk formulation developed by castellari et al 1998 available in nemo required atmospheric variables are sea level pressure pa total precipitation kg m2 s 2 m air temperature k 2 m dew point temperature k total cloud cover and zonal and meridional components of the 10 m wind m s specifically i the solar radiation is computed using reed 1977 formula ii the net longwave radiation is calculated following bignami et al 1995 iii drag coefficients used to compute wind stress are calculated according to hellerman and rosenstein 1983 and iv the latent and sensible heat fluxes are computed with classical bulk formulas parameterised as in kondo 1975 to avoid a drift in salinity the freshwater flux balance between evaporation precipitation river discharge and black sea input i e e p r b is corrected this correction is computed from the relaxation of the model sea surface salinity towards the sea surface salinity of the medatlas ii climatology medar medatlas group 2002 the restoration coefficient is set to 166 67 mm day psu madec et al 2008 freshwater flux is not corrected at river mouths with bulk formulation the modelled sea surface temperature is used to calculate the surface heat flux and hence a correction of the sea surface temperature is not required starting from an ocean at rest an 8 year spin up spanning from the 1st of january 1989 to the 31st of december 1996 is performed mediterranean initial conditions for potential temperature and salinity derive from the winter state of the medatlas ii climatology medar medatlas group 2002 the atlantic portion of the domain is initialised with monthly means of temperature and salinity from the interannual climatology oras 4 balmaseda et al 2013 for the spin up atmospheric variables from promes with a horizontal resolution of 50 km are used after the spin up two companion simulations are run differing only in the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric fields pr50 50 km resolution and pr25 25 km resolution both simulations extend from the 1st of january 1997 to the 31st of december 2008 3 mediterranean boundary fluxes and water masses prior to the examination of the tyrrhenian sub basin circulation as this is the first time that promes fields are used to drive an oceanic configuration over the mediterranean sea we ensure the overall performance of this new model setup on the mediterranean basin scale to do so we concentrate on diagnostics the representation of which is crucial to adequately reproduce the oceanography of the mediterranean sea for the simulation time period e g beuvier et al 2010 specifically we review the air sea fluxes computed from promes fields and the simulated fluxes across the strait of gibraltar we use those fluxes to quantify the mediterranean heat salt and water budgets the closure of which is essential to avoid temperature and salinity drifts as to the ocean we address the interannual variations of the basin scale heat and salt contents which indicate the ability of this setup to simulate the distinct mediterranean water masses for brevity and because it has been found to be representative of both runs this validation is done with results obtained from the simulation driven by pr50 fields 3 1 air sea fluxes here we evaluate the monthly averaged seasonal cycle of the surface heat flux w m2 and the surface freshwater flux m yr for the simulation period 1997 2008 we compare promes fluxes computed as explained in section 2 to air sea fluxes calculated from variables obtained from observational datasets the methodology adopted for the construction of the observational curves presented in fig 2 a and b is described in the supplementary material a summary of the annual mean values reported in section 3 as well as the annual mean estimates obtained in previous works is offered in table 1 the seasonal cycle of the heat flux given by the addition of the longwave radiation shortwave radiation latent and sensible heat fluxes is presented in fig 2a in which a positive sign indicates that the ocean gains heat from the atmosphere the surface heat flux derived from promes reproduces well qualitatively and quantitatively the seasonal variability from the observational curves but is slightly lower than observations in winter and above them in summer the computed heat flux is positive from march to september with a summer maximum of 171 99 w m2 the heat flux is negative the rest of the year and presents a minimum of 209 02 w m2 in december on average we find an annual mean net surface heat flux of 5 48 w m2 with an interannual standard deviation of 5 06 w m2 this average and its associated deviation are within the dataset range and are in line with heat flux reconstructions from observational products and from model studies table 1 the surface freshwater flux given by the balance between evaporation precipitation runoff and black sea input is presented in fig 2b in which a positive sign indicates that evaporation exceeds freshwater inputs promes simulates reasonably well the seasonal variability of the net water flux from march to september promes freshwater flux takes values slightly lower than those computed from observational products to understand this small mismatch it is important to recall that the medatlas ii climatology used to compute the freshwater flux correction extends until 2002 the simulated time period is therefore only partially covered the freshwater flux attains a minimum of 0 06 m yr in may and a maximum of 1 02 m yr in september on annual mean this has a value of 0 59 0 05 m yr as observed in table 1 this is slightly smaller than the means we compute from observational products and is closer to the upper limit of values derived from observational datasets in sánchez gómez et al 2011 the blue discontinuous line in fig 2b displays the mean value of the freshwater flux correction for the whole simulation time period the computed correction is 0 14 m yr the negative sign indicates that on average this correction lowers the net evaporation through the addition of water 3 2 transport at gibraltar the monthly averaged seasonal cycle of the water transport via the strait of gibraltar is presented in fig 2c and d values are given in sv 1 sv 106 m3 s and a positive sign points to transport from the atlantic into the mediterranean observational data concerning the water transport at gibraltar are sparse and a continuous record spanning over the simulated time period is not available to evaluate the computed transports we turn to existing literature water transport at the strait of gibraltar composed by atlantic inflow into the mediterranean at the surface and mediterranean outflow into the atlantic over the lower portion of the strait is subjected to a marked seasonal variability mediterranean outflow presents a minimum of 0 64 sv in february and a maximum of 0 78 sv in may giving a seasonal amplitude of 0 14 sv fig 2c a similar timing for the seasonal cycle has been found in observational studies with maximum and minimum outflow volumes positioned in spring and late fall winter respectively candela 2001 soto navarro et al 2010 atlantic inflow peaks at 0 80 sv in july and has a minimum value close to 0 66 sv in february resulting in a seasonal amplitude of 0 14 sv fig 2d the monthly averaged cycle for the inflow is also in good agreement with previous works which report maximum inflow volumes in summer and minimum transport in winter bryden et al 1994 garcía lafuente et al 2002 soto navarro et al 2010 for the atlantic inflow and the mediterranean outflow we find annual means of 0 75 0 02 sv and 0 70 0 02 sv respectively these are close to the lower limit of values based on direct measurements at the strait of gibraltar which vary between estimates from bryden et al 1994 and candela 2001 presented in table 1 as for the water transport the heat and salt transports at this strait are positive when these are directed towards the mediterranean for the net heat transport across gibraltar we find an annual mean of 5 88 0 36 w m2 the atlantic is a heat source for the mediterranean and this is well captured by the model as observed in table 1 our estimate is close to the reconstruction of macdonald et al 1994 from in situ measurements of water temperature and current velocity across this strait and shows a very good agreement with the ensemble average of harzallah et al 2016 for the salt transport at gibraltar we calculate 0 002 psu yr which is an intermediate value between the annual mean salt transports found in the regional simulations of beuvier et al 2010 and sevault et al 2014 3 3 water heat and salt budgets water volume conservation implied by a closed water budget requires the net surface water flux to equal the net water transport across gibraltar in our simulation both components have an annual mean value of about 0 05 sv and the water budget is therefore well closed table 1 as in previous model studies we assume that the heat budget is closed when the imbalance between the net heat gained via gibraltar and the net heat lost to the atmosphere equals the mediterranean heat content trend the latter corresponds to the temperature change from the first to the last year of the simulation divided by the total amount of years considered in the simulated period as stated above the net heat transport at gibraltar and the net surface heat flux are 5 88 0 36 w m2 and 5 48 5 06 w m2 respectively for the mediterranean heat content trend we compute 0 005 c yr which equals 1 w m2 the addition of the three components heat transport through the mediterranean surface heat transport through gibraltar and heat content trend is 0 6 w m2 and the budget is nearly closed the mediterranean does not gain or lose salt through the air sea interface and the salt budget is thus closed when the salt transport at gibraltar equals the mediterranean salt content trend both terms are 0 002 psu yr and the salt budget is balanced 3 4 heat and salt contents fig 3 shows annual series of potential temperature c and salinity psu computed from our model results in this figure annual means from the en4 climatology good et al 2013 and the interannual gridded dataset of rixen et al 2005 are also presented following rixen et al 2005 we calculate annual means for the entire mediterranean basin fig 3a and b as well as for several depth ranges fig 3c h the first layer extends from the sea surface to 150 m and serves to characterise hydrographic properties of the aw fig 3c and d the second one ranges from 150 to 600 m and allows us to evaluate intermediate waters namely liw fig 3e and f the third one is found from 600 m to the seafloor and is filled with deep waters fig 3g and h overall the model captures well the interannual variability of the mediterranean basin average temperature fig 3a for the simulation time period computed temperature is qualitatively and quantitatively close to climatological values with a small warm bias 0 1 c in comparison to en4 which is not larger than that presented in previous model studies in the upper layer temperature exhibits a good agreement with both climatologies temperature estimates are close to those from en4 and lay within the uncertainty associated to rixen et al 2005 climatology fig 3c intermediate waters still present a distinct interannual variability and annual means of simulated temperature resemble observational estimates fig 3e temperature of intermediate depth waters is about 0 1 c warmer than that of the en4 climatology all over the simulation period the warm bias encountered for intermediate depth waters exhibits a similar magnitude as that found on the mediterranean basin scale fig 3a this is an indication that intermediate depth waters are playing a role in the overall warming of the mediterranean basin in the deep basin interannual variations are weak and temperature mainly shows a small but progressive increase with time fig 3g this notwithstanding simulated temperature estimates are relatively close to observed values and the increase we find is not larger than that reported in previous model studies mediterranean average salinity is relatively well represented for the simulated period and presents a small salty bias that does not exceed 0 02 psu relative to en4 fig 3b in line with previous model studies e g l hévéder et al 2013 simulated interannual variations of salinity have a smaller amplitude than in the climatologies in the upper and intermediate layers annual means of salinity are mostly in the range of uncertainty associated to the climatology of rixen et al 2005 fig 3d and f as for temperature interannual variations of simulated salinity become less pronounced with depth and from 600 m to the seafloor these are almost absent fig 3h we can conclude that the model setup we present is able to adequately represent the mediterranean air sea fluxes the water transport across the strait of gibraltar and the interannual variability of the different mediterranean water masses the biases we report are not larger than those presented in previous studies see e g beuvier et al 2010 2012b l hévéder et al 2013 sevault et al 2014 harzallah et al 2016 water heat and salt budgets are nearly closed and thus the stability of the run is ensured 4 ocean behaviour in the tyrrhenian sub basin in this section we study the seasonal surface and intermediate depth circulation patterns derived from the simulations driven by pr50 and by pr25 to evaluate whether the prescription of pr50 or pr25 improves the representation of the surface circulation the obtained surface patterns are put against geostrophic velocity fields derived from altimeter data the obtained intermediate depth circulation patterns are compared to available literature 4 1 surface circulation over the tyrrhenian sea aw figs 4 and 5 illustrate seasonal averages of salinity and flow trajectories computed from the simulations driven by pr50 and pr25 at a depth of 55 m for the 1997 2008 period this depth is chosen because this is below the frictional ekman layer and allows us to concentrate on geostrophic features in these figures seasonal averages of geostrophic flow trajectories deduced from copernicus marine environment monitoring system cmems altimeter data for the simulated time period are also presented cmems provides multimission altimeter gridded sea surface heights and derived variables over the mediterranean sea with a horizontal resolution of 1 8 1 8 www marine copernicus eu cmems data indicates the presence of four dynamical coherent structures numbered consistently from 1 to 4 as well as some seasonal structures numbered 5 and 6 in winter in agreement with altimeter data and previous modelling and observational works the large scale circulation pattern that emerges from the simulations conducted with pr50 and pr25 fields points to a strong basin wide cyclonic stream around the sub basin fig 4a c see e g krivosheya and ovchinnikov 1973 artale et al 1994 fresh aw enters the tyrrhenian through the sardinia channel flows along slope to the easternmost sub basin and continues to the northwest until about 10 e and 42 n from there part of the flow moves to the north via the corsica channel while part of it flows to the south parallel to the coasts of corsica and sardinia until about 10 e and 39 n from the latter area water exits the sub basin through the sardinia channel or repeats the described path cyclonic structures 1 and 2 develop to the southeast and to the northeast of sardinia respectively these have been identified as permanent or quasi permanent features philippe and harang 1982 artale et al 1994 rio et al 2007 rinaldi et al 2010 vetrano et al 2010 iacono et al 2013 napolitano et al 2014 the northern one is the so called bonifacio gyre and the southern one with a more complex geometry can be regarded as a wide recirculation area connected to other smaller scale structures as remarked by rinaldi et al 2010 although both structures are reproduced with pr50 and pr25 fields they achieve a greater size and are bounded by faster currents with pr25 hence in better agreement with data the prescription of higher resolution atmospheric fields therefore improves the representation of these structures in cmems data a relatively small anticyclonic centre labelled as 3 is found to the southeast of 2 while it is missing in the simulation carried out with pr50 fields it arises in the simulation driven by pr25 fields flow trajectories from altimeter data also show a prominent anticyclonic centre positioned between 12 e 13 e to which we refer as 4 this has been reported in former observational studies as a permanent circulation feature budillon et al 2009 rinaldi et al 2010 with pr50 fields this structure is absent and a flow meander is found instead however when atmospheric fields with 25 km resolution are prescribed structure 4 is correctly reproduced in spring the general circulation pattern is similar to that in winter with some minor changes fig 4d f a general decrease of mean seasonal current velocities encompassed with an increasing number of the resolved dynamical structures is observed this notwithstanding the along slope cyclonic stream bordering the sub basin found in winter is still clearly displayed cyclonic structures 1 and 2 arise with both atmospheric collections but are better simulated with pr25 for the reasons listed above as in the previous season anticyclonic structures 3 and 4 the latter weaker than in winter are only captured with pr25 in contrast with winter flow along the northern coast of sicily exhibits more meanders and eddies arise over the continental shelf from about 13 e over the region labelled as 5 northwestward flow parallel to the italian coast appears shifted to the west and small eddies develop especially to the east of it the seaward displacement of this stream has also been found in the high resolution numerical simulations of napolitano et al 2014 for spring 2009 in summer the basin scale circulation pattern exhibits remarkable differences relative to winter and spring fig 5a c the previously described basin wide cyclonic circulation scheme breaks down and a great amount of dynamical structures are simulated this has also been reported in former model and observational studies in which the basin scale cyclonic stream has been found to be a winter feature e g artale et al 1994 iacono et al 2013 cyclonic structures 1 and 2 are reproduced with both pr50 and pr25 but the intensification and increase of the zonal extent of structure 2 that emerges from altimeter data in summer is particularly well represented in the simulation driven by pr25 in summer 2 and 3 intensify and get attached allowing the clear visualisation of the so called bonifacio dipole krivosheya and ovchinnikov 1973 astraldi and gasparini 1994 rinaldi et al 2010 with pr50 atmospheric data velocities are small at the expected location of eddy 3 and no well defined anticyclonic centre can be identified on the contrary with pr25 structure 3 which was found in all previous seasons with these fields intensifies substantially and the bonifacio dipole is clearly depicted as to anticyclone 4 current velocities are small and none of the two atmospheric collections tested are able to reproduce enclosed eddies besides the commented structures eddies 5 and 6 stand out as robust summer features anticyclonic eddy 5 forms over the northern coast of sicily this which has also been reported in iacono et al 2013 and napolitano et al 2014 hampers the development of northward flow parallel to the italian coast with pr25 anticyclonic centre 5 becomes less intense more elongated on the zonal direction and achieves a geometry that resembles more that of the corresponding structure from cmems data to the north of 5 a smaller and less intense anticyclone labelled as 6 is found with pr25 atmospheric fields currents that border this eddy intensify improving its representation compared to the case in which pr50 fields are used in line with previous works our results support that the appearance of anticyclonic dynamical structures to the east of the sub basin reverses the flow direction along the italian coast which becomes prevailingly southwards iacono et al 2013 napolitano et al 2014 northward transport through the corsica channel seems too weak or interrupted in fall flow velocities over the southern and eastern flanks of the tyrrhenian increase their magnitude and northward flow along the italian coast and through corsica channel are restored fig 5d f a cyclonic stream around the sub basin is not fully developed yet the resolved mesoscale activity decreases relative to summer but it is still more important than in winter cyclonic structures 1 and 2 are intense and as in summer 2 shows a remarkable increase of its zonal extension in comparison to winter and spring in agreement with altimeter data with pr25 fields anticyclone 3 is depicted and the bonifacio dipole is still visible the dipole does not arise with pr50 exceptionally anticyclonic centre 4 is found with pr50 but a pronounced flow meander arises with pr25 instead from the analysis above we can conclude that the main features of the seasonal variability of the surface large scale circulation are well captured regardless of the resolution of the atmospheric conditions imposed the prescription of pr25 however leads to an improved representation of the most robust and prominent dynamical structures resolved by the model 4 2 intermediate circulation over the tyrrhenian sea liw figs 6 and 7 display seasonal averages of salinity and flow trajectories computed from the simulations driven by pr50 and pr25 at a depth of 400 m for the 1997 2008 period this is the depth of maximum salinity representative of the liw core in both figures the approximate position at which the main surface flow structures were found at shallow levels is indicated with an arrow the structures are numbered as in figs 4 and 5 at this depth currents are slower than at shallower levels note the different arrow scaling in figs 4 7 liw enters the tyrrhenian via the strait of sicily travels to the east and at about 12 5 e and 38 5 n coinciding with a bathymetric anomaly flow bifurcates into two distinct branches regardless of the season one to the east and one to the west the branch that flows to the west reaches the westernmost sub basin through a variable route set by different smaller scale structures and exits the sub basin from the sardinia channel at this channel side by side circulation found at shallow depths is replaced by one directional flow in winter liw enters the tyrrhenian and flows cyclonically along slope around the sub basin fig 6a and b in contrast to what was found at shallower levels from 12 e and 41 n part of the northwestward flow parallel to the italian coast deflects towards the southwest following topographic contours until 10 5 e and 40 n in menna and poulain 2010 mediterranean intermediate circulation for the 2003 2010 period is reconstructed using argo profiling floats in spite of the low resolution of argo data 1 1 the described southwestward water branch obtained in our simulations stands out as a robust flow feature from the latter location flow continues to the south parallel to the coastlines of corsica and sardinia and exits the sub basin at sardinia channel as in former works some of the structures found at shallower levels are detectable at intermediate depths vetrano et al 2010 napolitano et al 2014 with pr50 fields the outer contour that defines cyclonic area 1 is still visible at this depth when pr25 fields are prescribed the outer contour of 1 as well as the geometry of structures 2 and 4 are clearly depicted transition from winter to spring entails similar changes to those found at shallower depths fig 6c and d essentially the winter circulation pattern remains but current velocities decrease northward flow along the coast of italy is slightly shifted to the west and small eddies develop to the east of this stream the large scale pattern we report is in agreement with results from the high resolution numerical simulation of vetrano et al 2010 in which a cyclonic stream around the sub basin accompanied by a flow branch crossing from about 12 e and 41 n to 10 5 e and 40 n is found for spring 2004 the flow configuration we report contradicts napolitano et al 2014 in which the flow vein that crosses the sub basin from east to west is absent and southward flow parallel to the italian coast is found for april 2009 this could indicate that april 2009 is not representative of the mean state of the intermediate spring circulation and highlights the necessity of longer simulations to assess robust seasonal circulation patterns with pr50 and pr25 structures 1 and 2 can still be traced at this depth structures 3 and 4 which appeared with pr25 at shallow depths bounded by currents weaker than in winter are not visible at 400 m in summer as for shallow levels the overall winter and spring circulation scheme does not develop and a greater number of dynamical structures resolved is detected fig 7a and b cyclonic flow around the sub basin does not extend further north than about 41 n where waters deflect to the west the northernmost sub basin appears disconnected from the rest in contrast to what occurs at the surface flow parallel to italy does not reverse direction and is still prevailingly northward in summer with pr50 fields the outer contour of structure 1 and the signature of eddy 5 on salinity are visible with pr25 structures 1 2 3 and 5 are found in fall a transition towards the winter circulation starts fig 7c and d currents intensify and dynamical structures become less abundant eastward flow parallel to the sicilian coast extends further to the east whereas most of the flow that moves along the italian coast deflects from 41 n to the west part of it also continues to the north and completes the longer cyclonic route typical from winter and spring whilst with pr50 fields only the external contour of structure 1 is visible in the simulation driven by pr25 structures 1 2 and 3 are represented as for shallow depths the main features of the seasonal variability of the large scale intermediate depth circulation is well captured with 50 km or 25 km resolution fields but a greater amount of smaller structures is simulated with 25 km atmospheric fields overall the simulated basin scale patterns and their seasonal variability show a good agreement with the schemes proposed by krivosheya and ovchinnikov 1973 on the basis of composite hydrographic datasets the fact that the most intense structures found at the surface appear at intermediate depths reflects the barotropic nature of the flow e g vetrano et al 2010 our results highlight that for a given season a greater amount of the surface dynamical structures appear at 400 m with pr25 fields figs 4 7 a relevant insight that arises from section 4 1 is that the prescription of pr25 with some exceptions i e summer anticyclonic eddy 5 generally intensifies surface dynamical structures this intensification which is supported by the regional distribution of the sea surface height see fig 2s of the supplementary material and the accompanying text causes a greater amount of the surface structures to be visible at this depth the resolved liw mesoscale variability that cannot be explained by barotropic impact may be related to baroclinic instabilities associated with the energetic cyclonic current that borders the sub basin or part of it see escudier et al 2016 5 discussion in section 5 1 we investigate the effect of the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric data on water properties in section 5 2 we examine whether the improved representation of the dynamical structures observed with pr25 is driven by changes of the transport at the major tyrrhenian straits or rather by the regional distribution of atmospheric fields 5 1 effect of the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric fields on water properties at a depth of 55 m aw reaches the westernmost end of sicily with a salinity not higher than 37 7 psu regardless of the season figs 4 and 5 salinity increases within the tyrrhenian due to en route evaporation results from the model study of napolitano et al 2014 indicate that aw salinity is maximum to the west of the sub basin especially inside cyclone 2 where vertical mixing with underlying salty waters occurs in line with that study we also find an overall salinity increase to the west and maximum values within structure 2 from this location salty waters are exported to different areas of the sub basin namely to the south the improved simulation of dynamical structures with pr25 fields has a concomitant effect on salinity distribution this can be checked over the northern tyrrhenian sub basin where in winter salinities close to 38 2 psu are found over a more extensive area with pr25 this is caused by the improved simulation of cyclonic structure 2 which is stronger and more enclosed with pr25 than with pr50 fig 4b and c changes in the representation of structure 2 also have an impact on the regional distribution of the sea surface temperature which is lower and achieves values more consistent with observational data inside it with pr25 fields see fig 3s of the supplementary material and the corresponding text the latter result stresses the relevance of an adequate resolution of atmospheric models in coupled atmosphere ocean models in order to achieve a correct heat distribution over the sea surface which is a primary driver of atmospheric processes at a depth of 400 m liw enters the tyrrhenian with a salinity close to 38 8 psu figs 6 and 7 salinity is maximum close to the strait of sicily where liw flows into the sub basin at this location liw is up to 0 025 psu saltier when pr25 fields are prescribed compared to pr50 fields this must be related to processes that occur out of the tyrrhenian sub basin namely over the eastern mediterranean where liw is produced and transported up to the sicily strait from the entrance area liw salinity decreases gradually towards the sardinia channel due to en route mixing with surrounding fresher waters contrary to what happens at shallow levels salinity decreases from east to west 5 2 what is needed for an improved representation of the resolved dynamical structures with pr25 5 2 1 seasonal variability of the water transport at the tyrrhenian sea straits fig 8 shows the monthly averaged seasonal cycle of water transport at sardinia a corsica b and sicily c straits obtained from the simulations driven by pr50 and pr25 for the 1997 2008 period positive velocities indicate eastward transport at sardinia northward flow at corsica and southeastward transport at sicily for the calculations the interface between the different water masses is defined as follows aw liw interface is defined by a density of 28 9 e g vetrano et al 2004 2010 napolitano et al 2014 at sardinia channel the interface between liw and tdw is set to 29 1 vetrano et al 2010 we observe that for a given strait transports of the different water masses obtained with pr50 and pr25 are almost identical this finding is in line with results presented in section 4 which indicate that the seasonal variability of the tyrrhenian large scale circulation does not change to a large extent when higher resolution atmospheric fields are prescribed in all cases transports of aw and liw are maximum in late fall winter and minimum in summer gasparini et al 2008 a summary of the maximum minimum and average liw and aw transports for each of these traits is offered in table 2 winter and summer cross sections of salinity and velocity at the examined straits are presented and described in fig 4s of the supplementary material and the corresponding text in fig 4s the resulting position of the interfaces between the different water masses assuming the above described criteria is also depicted at sardinia channel the seasonal cycle is fundamentally modulated by the transport of aw fig 8a net water transport which results from the addition of the transports of aw liw and tdw yields annual means of 0 37 sv with pr50 and 0 36 sv with pr25 in line with vetrano et al 2010 at corsica channel in agreement with observations from gasparini et al 2008 water transport is mainly composed by aw and a minor volume of liw fig 8b we compute an annual mean net water transport of 0 34 sv and 0 33 sv with pr50 and pr25 fields respectively data obtained from mooring and ctd measurements at corsica channel from 1985 to 2005 indicate an annual mean net water transport of 0 49 sv gasparini et al 2008 the latter value can be considered close to our estimates especially taking into account that in gasparini et al 2008 the greatest transport occurs in the 1980 s decade which is not included within the time period we simulate at the strait of sicily the calculated annual mean liw transports are 0 63 sv and 0 64 sv with pr50 and pr25 fields respectively these are within the lower range of available values e g moretti et al 1993 but are smaller than 1 sv the annual mean liw transport found in gasparini et al 2008 for the 1993 2006 period computed transports are adequately reproduced and differences in response to the use of pr50 or pr25 fields are minor the improved simulation of the resolved dynamical structures with pr25 is thus not linked to a better representation of the strait transport and may be associated with changes in the spatial distribution of the atmospheric fields this aspect is tackled in the next section 5 2 2 winds and ocean circulation figs 9 a f show winter and summer averages of wind direction and wind speed in m s computed for the 1997 2008 period making use of pr50 and pr25 fields in this figure seasonal averages of wind velocity derived from the cross calibrated multi platform ccmp dataset for the simulation time period are also presented ccmp gridded dataset combines cross calibrated satellite winds obtained from remote sensing systems remss and provides winds with a horizontal resolution of 0 25 0 25 atlas et al 2011 in this figure black discontinuous contours indicate the outer edge of the corresponding surface structures numbered as in figs 4 and 5 in all seasons ccmp winds are highest in the areas adjacent to sardinia and sicily straits fig 9a and d wind intensification within this region appears better represented with pr25 fig 9c and f winds from pr50 reach maximum speeds which are always about 0 5 m s lower than in the ccmp dataset with pr25 winds attain maximum speeds close to 8 m s in winter and 6 m s in summer both values in agreement with ccmp data ccmp winds are also particularly intense to the east of the bonifacio strait located close to 9 e 41 n fig 1 which is unfortunately not contemplated in this database in winter ccmp data indicates the existence of a zonally oriented wind tongue characterised by maximum speeds of about 7 m s the development of this structure may be driven by funnelling of westerlies through the bonifacio strait which is a very well documented phenomena see gérigny et al 2015 and references therein focusing on promes fields we observe that wind funnelling through the bonifacio strait is only resolved in pr25 wind intensification due to wind channelling enhances wind speeds to the east of the strait reaching locally up to 7 5 m s in pr50 wind velocities are about 0 5 m s lower than in pr25 in summer ccmp winds also exhibit a remarkable intensification over this area where velocities attain up to 5 5 m s different to winter in summer orographic wind funnelling occurs in both pr50 and pr25 datasets this notwithstanding wind intensification is more pronounced in pr25 whereas pr50 winds achieve maximum speeds close to 5 m s pr25 winds reach maximum values of about 6 m s it is worth to point out that with pr25 regardless of the season cyclonic structure 2 positions over the areas where wind speed is high ccmp winds indicate a slackening to the southeast of the tyrrhenian sub basin where wind speeds are low over this area the regional distribution of winds differs substantially depending on the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric fields to the north of sicily at about 14 e ccmp winds are not higher than 5 5 m s 6 5 m s in winter and 3 5 m s 4 5 m s in summer in all seasons pr50 winds are about 0 5 m s greater than in ccmp while pr25 winds have almost the same magnitude as in ccmp winds from ccmp also show a remarkable velocity gradient around this area and this is better reproduced with pr25 overall in line with our results an improved simulation of winds near the coastlines with higher resolution atmospheric fields due to a better representation of land sea gradients has also been found in previous model studies obermann et al 2016 akhtar et al 2017 to establish a link between the wind representation and the ocean circulation we now study the mean wind work at play in the tyrrhenian sub basin wunsch 1998 renault et al 2016 we examine winter and summer averages of wind work for the simulations driven by pr50 fig 10 a and c and pr25 fig 10b and d in this figure the outer contours of the corresponding surface structures are also superimposed to compute the mean wind work we adopt the following expression wind work 1 ρ o τ x u o τ y v o where ρo is the density of sea water assumed 1020 kg m3 τx and τy the zonal and meridional components of the wind stress in n m2 and uo and vo the zonal and meridional components of the ocean current velocities averaged from the surface to a depth of 55 m in m s in this expression the overbars indicate long term seasonal averages estimated for the 1997 2008 period computed from daily means see renault et al 2016 the wind work represents the exchange of kinetic energy between the atmosphere and the ocean and a positive sign indicates that both winds and ocean currents move along the same direction and therefore that wind provides kinetic energy to the ocean a negative sign on the contrary entails that winds reduce the ocean s kinetic energy in this figure positive and negative side by side values should be interpreted to indicate either the presence of an eddy water recirculation or wind gradients as to the large scale spatial distribution of the wind work it is greatest in absolute value over the near shore region regardless of the horizontal resolution of atmospheric fields in winter the wind work is positive over the western and southern boundaries of the sub basin and negative along the eastern tyrrhenian coast fig 10a and b in this season as concluded in section 4 1 a cyclonic stream that borders the sub basin develops this drives northwestward flow along the eastern coast of the tyrrhenian which moves against winds namely from the west or the northwest in summer the basin scale cyclonic circulation vanishes and so does the described regional distribution of the wind work in more detail in all seasons wind injects larger amounts of kinetic energy through the western rim of cyclonic structure 2 in the simulation driven by pr25 fields this is in line with the previously reported intensification of winds in response to orographic funnelling through the bonifacio strait with pr25 also the regions over which the wind work enhances along the boundary of cyclone 2 appear more extensive in the simulation performed with pr25 especially in summer the improved representation of structure 2 with pr25 fields which entails an increase of its size and an intensification of its associated currents see figs 4c f and 5c f can be thus clearly linked to wind activity this result supports findings from previous studies in which the wind driven nature of this structure is highlighted moen 1984 in the regional model study of béranger et al 2010 the authors report that an increase of the atmospheric forcing resolution allows orographic wind channelling which contributes to the maintenance of a vigorous cyclonic gyre circulation in the gulf of lions based on the study of the regional distribution of the summer relative vorticity ζ for the 1997 2008 period we compute the areas enclosed by the outermost contour that defines structure 2 with pr50 and pr25 assuming a contour interval of 6 10 7 1 s the surface area of cyclone 2 increases from 2 13 109 m2 with pr50 to 8 48 109 m2 with pr25 fields the computed areas correspond to equivalent radius of 26 07 km and 51 96 km respectively eddy 3 which is particularly developed in summer and is only clearly reproduced in the simulation driven by pr25 is under the influence of westerlies channelled via the bonifacio strait see fig 9 in summer with pr50 fields the wind work over the area where eddy 3 would be expected is rather small and it does not emerge with pr25 kinetic energy provided by the wind along its northern boundary enhances and this may favour its appearance the improved representation of winds through the bonifacio strait is therefore responsible for the better simulation of structures 2 and 3 allowing the development of the summer bonifacio dipole with pr25 other structures that are affected by wind representation are anticyclones 5 and 6 both arise regardless of the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric fields and constitute robust summer features as to structure 5 with pr25 the wind work over its northeastern boundary decreases and the area over which wind injects kinetic energy has a more elongated geometry relative to the simulation driven by pr50 this is consistent with the improved representation of the wind velocity gradients over this region due to wind slackening with pr25 the slowdown of eddy 5 observed with pr25 consistent with cmems geostrophic velocities is thus in agreement with the observed changes in the wind activity to the north of 5 anticyclone 6 arises with pr25 eddy 6 slightly intensifies and this structure together with eddy 5 form a summer dipole which is not so well represented with pr50 to further assess the role of local winds in the improvements observed in the tyrrhenian circulation with higher resolution atmospheric fields we now examine summer time series of wind stress curl a and eddy kinetic energy eke computed making use of daily means of ocean velocity as well as the mean ocean currents for the 1997 2008 period b over the tyrrhenian sub basin fig 11 this analysis concentrates on the summer season because the winter circulation pattern is prone to aw stream instabilities rather than local atmospheric forcing as shown by iacono et al 2013 furthermore in summer the improved representation of dynamical structures is more remarkable than in other seasons overall in the simulations driven by pr25 fields wind stress curl and eke present higher values than with pr50 fields thus in better agreement with observational data the correlation coefficient between simulated and ccmp wind stress curl increases from 0 63 with pr50 to 0 70 with pr25 fields wind stress curl mean biases for the simulation time period decrease from 4 91 10 8 n m3 with pr50 to 3 64 10 9 n m3 with pr25 in agreement with former modelling studies performed with nemo med12 e g beuvier et al 2012a simulated eke levels are lower than those from cmems this notwithstanding the prescription of higher resolution atmospheric fields improves substantially its representation the correlation coefficient between simulated and cmems eke takes values smaller than 0 10 with pr50 and 0 56 with pr25 fields also mean biases decrease in magnitude from 15 08 cm2 s2 with pr50 to 7 21 cm2 s2 with pr25 fields fig 11 also shows that high low values of wind stress curl often coincide in time with an increase decrease of the eke levels the correlation coefficient between the wind stress curl from ccmp and the simulated eke is greater than 0 50 regardless of the atmospheric field resolution although there may be different factors controlling changes in the eke wind stress curl is clearly at play 6 summary and conclusions this work is dedicated to the study of the role of the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric fields in the long term seasonal variability of the tyrrhenian sea circulation to that end we adopt the eddy permitting ocean circulation model nemo med12 which is a mediterranean configuration of nemo and high resolution atmospheric fields from promes regional climate model nested in era interim we examine two companion simulations that cover the 1997 2008 period and only differ in the horizontal resolution of the atmospheric fields which is 50 km pr50 or 25 km pr25 because promes fields are here used for the first time to simulate the oceanography of the mediterranean sea the overall performance of this novel setup is examined prior to the study of the tyrrhenian sea circulation we show that the presented configuration reproduces conveniently the seasonal cycle of the mediterranean air sea fluxes and the transports across the strait of gibraltar the interannual variability of the distinct mediterranean water masses is relatively well simulated and the biases we report are not larger than those found in previous studies the most relevant findings extracted from the examination of the tyrrhenian circulation the primary focus of this study with this particular configuration are the seasonal variability of the tyrrhenian basin scale circulation is well captured with pr50 or pr25 but the representation of the resolved dynamical structures is improved with pr25 fields in line with cmems geostrophic velocities the winter and spring large scale surface circulation patterns are characterised by a broad cyclonic stream around the sub basin which does not arise in summer and fall regardless of the resolution of the atmospheric fields the prescription of pr25 improves the geometry position and velocity of the simulated ocean dynamical structures at shallow levels intermediate depth circulation patterns from the simulations driven by pr50 and pr25 fields for winter spring and summer fall respectively show a good agreement with schemes from krivosheya and ovchinnikov 1973 in winter and spring most liw flows cyclonically around the tyrrhenian and only a minor part of it crosses the sub basin from about 12 e and 41 n to 10 5 e and 40 n in summer and fall most liw deflects to the southwest and the northern domain of the sub basin becomes isolated only the most prominent surface flow structures are found at intermediate depths the use of pr25 fields generally intensifies them and therefore a greater amount of the surface eddies gyres and meanders are reproduced with pr25 at a depth of 400 m the presence or absence of structures such as gyres and eddies as well as their geometry and velocity exert a first order control in the regional distribution of salt and heat in coupled atmosphere ocean models it is advisable that atmospheric grids have a resolution greater than 50 km in order to achieve a correct distribution of heat over the sea surface which is a primary driver of atmospheric processes for uncoupled ocean simulations not focused on mesoscale size processes atmospheric fields with 50 km would seem sufficient improvements in the simulation of the most robust dynamical structures with pr25 are not linked to changes in the transport across sardinia corsica and sicily straits but rather relates to the better simulation of winds changes in the regional distribution of the wind work explain to a large extent the improved representation of the dynamical structures observed in the simulation driven by pr25 in view of our results we can conclude that although there is room improvements the overall performance of the presented model setup is quite satisfactory because conclusions drawn could be to some extent model dependent future work will potentially include a multimodel analysis in the frame of medcordex this will allow us to get insight into the consistency of results obtained with promes atmospheric data and results derived from other model configurations an interesting follow up of this work could include a quantification of the eddy wind work the barotropic conversion from mean kinetic energy to eke and the transformation from eddy potential energy to eke a current effort is being done to achieve a promes nemo med12

24058,a performance study of seven regional ocean configurations based on nemo has been carried out for the adriatic sea over a common period 1980 2012 assessed models differ in resolution model physics atmospheric forcing forced vs coupled models and river discharges imposed within the adriatic sea models have been evaluated on the long term temperature and salinity measurements in all of the adriatic sub basins in particular within dense water collectors jabuka pit and south adriatic pit and dense water formation sites northern and southern adriatic adriatic wide salinity content is mostly linked to the proper introduction of the overall water budget rather than to the local river forcing forced models mostly overestimate temperature and salinity values on average coupled models better reproduce the thermohaline properties and processes in particular the adriatic ionian bimodal oscillating system bios reversals and its decadal variability wintertime heat losses are playing major role in defining the adriatic deep water adw transport rates in coupled models while in forced models preconditioning in salinity is the most important factor further on increase of resolution of the atmospheric forcing results in more realistic ocean behaviour including dense water formation dwf in the complex coastal northern adriatic however all models have large temperature biases and lower deep stratification at the dense water collector sites indicating overall underrepresentation of the adriatic dwf consequently mixed layer depth in the southern adriatic is overestimated reaching the bottom during some years ocean model resolution and river forcing seem to play a second order role in defining the overall adriatic ionian thermohaline properties while inclusion of aerosol trend only slightly modified the bios reproduction keywords adriatic sea regional ocean modelling model validation thermohaline properties dense water formation adriatic ionian bimodal oscillating system 1 introduction in the last decades regional climate models have been developed as a tool for assessing past and future climate changes in areas not properly recognized by the global models producing fine scale information useful for assessment and impact studies e g giorgi 2006 yet regional ocean climate models and long term ocean simulations still suffer from a number of shortcomings ruti et al 2016 rummukainen 2016 giorgi and gutowski 2016 although their reliability is constantly improved improvements include model parameterizations scinocca et al 2016 resolution and bathymetry pinardi et al 1996 oddo et al 2005 soto navarro et al 2015 atmospheric forcing castellari et al 2000 herrmann and somot 2008 artale et al 2009 beranger et al 2010 nabat et al 2015 zou et al

others for that reason different regional ocean model configurations are tested for any given basin to achieve their best performance one of such basin is the mediterranean sea for which numerous long term ocean simulations have been tested gualdi et al 2013 sevault et al 2014 ruti et al 2016 processes in the mediterranean are characterized by strong temporal and spatial variability josey 2003

and numerous straits pose a challenge for proper reproduction of mesoscale processes in particular of coastal and open convection dense water generation that drive the mediterranean thermohaline circulation roether and schlitzer 1991 schlitzer et al 1991 estournel et al 2016 waldman et al 2017 a special tribute is paid to the dynamics and water mass exchange between the mediterranean and atlantic through the 14 km wide strait of gibraltar soto navarro et al 2015 further it is especially challenging to reproduce the mediterranean winds even with high resolution mesoscale atmospheric models myers et al 1998 ruti et al 2008 herrmann et al 2011 davolio et al 2015 this particularly refers to the winds that are significantly modified by the coastal orography mistral tramontane bora drobinski et al 2001 chronis et al 2011 grisogono and belušić 2009 winds misrepresentation leads to misrepresentation of their effects to the ocean and thus to misrepresentation of a great number of ocean phenomena herrmann and somot 2008 béranger et al 2010 ličer et al 2016 as a consequence the mediterranean ocean modelling has a long tradition of constant improvement of its different segments on the long term basis the mediterranean models have mostly been tested for the western mediterranean only somot et al 2018 waldman et al 2016 ruti et al 2016 in this study we are assessing performance of regional ocean models in the adriatic sea over the long term time scale the adriatic basin fig 1 consists of a shallow northern shelf with depths up to 80 m middle adriatic depressions jabuka pit with maximum depth of 280 m and the 1230 m deep circular southern adriatic pit sap the basin is connected with the ionian sea through the 850 m deep otranto strait general adriatic circulation is cyclonic controlled by the topography and the bathymetry wind stress surface buoyancy fluxes river discharge and mass and energy exchanges through the strait of otranto orlić et al 1992 artegiani et al 1997a poulain and raicich 2001 zavatarelli et al 2002 it is a place where dense water formation dwf occurs during wintertime both through cooling of shelf waters in the northern adriatic resulting in the northern adriatic dense water naddw vilibić and supić 2005 and through the deep convection in the sap that results in the adriatic deep water adw buljan and zore armanda 1976 gačić et al 2002 bora wind driven cooling in the shallow northern adriatic is intense enough to induce a substantial surface heat loss up to a maximum of 2000 w m2 grisogono and belušić 2009 janeković et al 2014 davolio et al 2015 resulting in ocean convection process that rapidly reaches the very bottom resulting naddw spreads over the entire northern adriatic malanotte rizzoli 1977 bergamasco et al 1999 freshwater load in this area raicich 1996 especially during late autumn and early winter is also crucial in defining the naddw characteristics franco and michelato 1992 as these freshwaters especially the ones coming from po river spread over a large part of the northern adriatic and therefore control the salinity content artegiani et al 1997a b supić et al 2004 newly formed naddw recognized as one of the densest mediterranean water mass vilibić and supić 2005 mihanović et al 2013 flows along the western adriatic coast in southward direction as a density current nof 1983 and in a short time less than a month accumulates in jabuka pit artegiani and salusti 1987 vilibić 2003 janeković et al 2014 a month later the naddw is transported towards the deep layers of the sap vilibić and šantić 2008 bensi et al 2013 querin et al 2013 carniel et al 2016 chiggiato et al 2016 the adw which is itself generated in the sap as a direct result of winter surface heat losses has a lower density than the naddw but an order of magnitude larger volume ovchinnikov et al 1985 gačić et al 2002 vilibić and orlić 2002 numerous studies reported interannual variability in the intensity of the deep convection process occurring in the sap mantziafou and lascaratos 2004 2008 oddo and guarnieri 2011 which in turn affects the adw density values and total volumes this variability is preconditioned by the presence of saltier water mass i e by the amount of warm and saline levantine intermediate water liw that enters the adriatic sea from the levantine basin zore armanda 1963 gačić et al 2010 dunić et al 2018 and together with wintertime cooling determine the rate of the dwf cardin and gačić 2003 after generation the adw exits the adriatic sea through the bottom layers of the otranto strait gačić et al 1996 reale et al 2016 and flows towards the deep layers of the ionian sea and eastern mediterranean sustaining the eastern mediterranean thermohaline circulation roether and schlitzer 1991 manca et al 2002 somot et al 2006 the adriatic thermohaline and biogeochemical properties are also characterized by substantial decadal variations buljan 1953 civitarese et al 2010 vilibić et al 2012 which are coherent with the circulation regimes in the northern ionian sea experimental studies using sea surface height ssh measurements gačić et al 2010 mihanović et al 2015 identified two different circulation regimes in the northern ionian cyclonic and anticyclonic first transition was documented between 1997 and 1998 when circulation switched from anticyclonic to cyclonic contrasting transition was observed in 2006 gačić et al 2010 with anticyclonic pattern persisting until 2011 gačić et al 2014 one of the main drivers of the observed variability is the internal dynamics of the adriatic ionian system as upper layer circulation reversal in the northern ionian is affected by the changes in geostrophic balance of the area due to different water mass advection borzelli et al 2009 gačić et al 2010 when the northern ionian sea experiences cyclonic circulation regime saline liw enters the adriatic sea and increases density of both the naddw and the adw gačić et al 2010 during the anticyclonic regime less saline western mediterranean waters enter the adriatic leading to a decrease in naddw and adw density spreading of the adw and the naddw with different characteristics into the northern ionian is hypothesized to change the vorticity through stretching or compressing of the water column at the perimeter of the gyre thus changing the circulation regimes it is suggested that described adriatic ionian feedback mechanism behaves as a bimodal oscillating system called the adriatic ionian bimodal oscillating system bios gačić et al 2010 the adriatic dwf dynamics and variability was investigated via both experimental studies buljan and zore armanda 1976 gačić et al 2002 bensi et al 2013 mihanović et al 2013 2015 and using numerical simulations explicitly designed to investigate these processes bergamasco et al 1999 beg paklar et al 2001 dobričić 2002 zavatarelli et al 2002 cushman roisin et al 2007 janeković et al 2010 2014 gunduz et al 2013 however these studies were carried out only for a short time scale and on the process level also neglecting the analyses of coupled runs there are a few studies that document dwf interannual variability mantziafou and lascaratos 2008 béranger et al 2010 oddo and guarnieri 2011 revealing its high temporal and spatial variability in those studies importance of high resolution properly introduced topography and external forcing atmospheric and river discharges as well as model coupling strategies is suggested in order to properly simulate these physical processes that require a mesoscale approach their conclusions were however based only on the analysis of short term simulations the only study involving a multi decadal regional simulation performance analysis of the adriatic thermohaline properties and processes was recently conducted by dunić et al 2018 the focus of that study was the dwf and the bios reproduction as well as their interannual and decadal variability using nemo med8 simulations 50 year run in order to quantify long term changes in oceanographic properties of the adriatic ionian thermohaline circulation and its variability on a longer time scales and to test the performance of climate models with different setup in the basin we used seven different regional hindcast simulations based on various configurations of nemo mediterranean versions covering era interim period 1980 2012 these simulations are produced within the framework of the med cordex initiative www medcordex eu we chose models with different settings to investigate impact of different factors vertical and horizontal resolution freshwater load surface heat fluxes air sea interaction and aerosol trend effect on interannual and decadal variability of the adriatic ionian thermohaline properties including the adriatic dwf and the bios we evaluated performance of models on the long term in situ data collected over the three northern adriatic transects the palagruža sill transect and at jabuka pit and south adriatic pit as well as on the altimetry remote observations section 2 presents data used for evaluation gives basic description of models and provides an assessment of rivers and wintertime net heat fluxes section 3 pictures overall performance of the models while verification on in situ data is presented in section 4 section 5 presents the model performances on reproduction of the dwf and the bios discussion and conclusions are provided in section 6 2 material and methods 2 1 regional ocean system models 2 1 1 models and models setup nemo med model is a numerical 3d ocean model adapted regionally for the reproduction of the mediterranean properties and processes e g beuvier et al 2010 herrmann et al 2010 somot et al 2018 it is based on the nemo nucleus for european modelling of the ocean free surface finite difference primitive equation numerical global ocean model madec 2008 the domain of the model covers the mediterranean sea and a small fraction of the atlantic used as a buffer zone imposed off the strait of gibraltar with 3d damping of temperature and salinity and 2d damping of sea level imposed exchange with the black sea is parameterized as a river point source that imposes the black sea evaporation precipitation runoff e p r freshwater budget to the aegean sea the model bathymetry is based on etopo 5 x5 database smith and sandwell 1997 vertical mixing is parameterized by the turbulent kinetic energy scheme blanke and delecluse 1993 by an enhanced vertical diffusion of 10 m² s for convective adjustment and by an interior background diffusivity of 10 m² s initial conditions are taken from the medar medatlas ii derived for the 1960s medar medatlas 2002 while spin up period and the ocean lateral conditions differ between simulations depending on the available computing resources and requirements at the time of models run execution using 7 nemo med simulations we analysed the reproduction of the long term adriatic thermohaline properties and processes the selected simulations differ in horizontal and vertical resolutions spatial and temporal resolution of the atmospheric forcing inclusion or not of the aerosol trend freshwater forcing coming from the rivers and the inclusion or not of the atmospheric coupling more details are listed in table 1 simulations are marked as follows med8f med8c1 c3 and med12f1 f3 where 8 and 12 stand for the overall horizontal resolution 1 8 vs 1 12 while f and c stand for the forced and coupled simulation respectively the med12f3 simulation has an additional nested eddy permitting model with higher horizontal resolution 1 36 in the adriatic ionian area all simulations are run for 1980 2012 period all med8 based and med12 based simulations have 43 and 75 unevenly spaced vertical z layers respectively med8f simulation is forced by arperav2 atmospheric forcing daily mean fields of momentum freshwater and heat fluxes with resolution of 50 km relaxation to the era 40 sea surface temperature sst herrmann et al 2010 while med12f1 f3 models are forced by aldera atmospheric forcing 3 h mean fields of momentum freshwater and heat fluxes with resolution of 12 km relaxation to the era interim sst hamon et al 2016 med12f3 differs from the med12f1 f2 in the initial conditions spin up duration sst relaxation term and in the inclusion of additional freshwater flux correction as for the river forcing freshwater fluxes are introduced at the river mouths as the surface boundary flux in the forced models taking the climatology from the rivdis database vörösmarty et al 1996 ludwig et al 2009 med8f contains 33 main river mouths in the mediterranean of which 8 are placed in the adriatic two of them in front of the river po and the rest are albanian rivers red dots in fig 1 in dunić et al 2018 freshwater fluxes in med12f1 and med12f3 come from the same 33 mediterranean rivers and the remaining discharge of the mediterranean is imposed as an averaged coastal runoff over all lateral grid points beuvier et al 2012 the difference in med12f2 simulation is the treatment of the adriatic sea instead of the previous 8 adriatic river mouths with additional coastal runoff we imposed a new river climatology with total of 44 adriatic river mouths and no additional coastal runoff as documented by vilibić et al 2016 seasonal signal in river discharges in med12f2 was taken from vilibić et al 2016 modulated in time with ludwig et al 2009 interannual variability fully coupled regional climate models med8c1 c3 include regional representation of the atmosphere aladin climate model radu et al 2008 land surface and hydrology isba model noilhan and mahfouf 1996 rivers trip model oki and sud 1998 and the ocean the same nemo med8 model as in med8f the coupling is performed on a daily basis by the oasis coupler valcke 2013 atmospheric lateral conditions are taken from the era interim reanalysis aerosol climatology in the atmospheric models or forcing is included in all simulations with more recent climatology used in med8c2 c3 simulations med8c2 differs from med8c1 in the spin up period aerosol climatology and in additional spectral nudging applied to the atmospheric forcing in med8c1 med8c3 differs from med8c2 in the inclusion of the observed decreasing trend in the sulfate aerosol optical depth aod forcing over the 1980 2012 period which was found to improve the reproduction of the past european climate trend for radiation 2 meter temperature over land and sst nabat et al 2014 2 1 2 assessment of the adriatic river forcing river discharges constitute a significant portion of the water mass budget in the adriatic sea affecting strongly ocean properties particularly in the shallow northern adriatic kourafalou 1999 vilibić et al 2016 thus an assessment of annual river discharges introduced to the models and their seasonal cycles was performed separately for the three adriatic regions fig 2 east eastern coastline of the adriatic denoted with yellow colour north northern part denoted with blue colour and west western coastline denoted with green colour in fig 1 annual river discharges in models range between 600 and 1560 m3 s in east 1479 and 2192 m3 s in north and 0 and 333 m3 s in west domain med8f has only six river mouths vjosa seman shkumbini erzen mat and drin in east two adige and po in north and zero river mouths in west in total eight rivers mouths in the adriatic sea in addition to these rivers med12f1 and med12f3 has included coastal runoff for further explanation see section 2 1 1 rivers introduced in med12f2 are based on the recent measurements for which we can consider to be most reliable vilibić et al 2016 and are totalling in 18 14 and 12 river mouths in east north and west respectively due to the lack of the data the discharge rates in med8f med12f1 and med12f3 after 2001 didn t include interannual variability instead the annual discharge rates were taken as a constant equal to the 2001 value however seasonal variability was still included in that period all models show similar interannual and seasonal variability in any given region east west or north but differ significantly between regions in the eastern adriatic east minimum discharge rates are found during summer while highest rates are present in autumn winter period however med8f with only eight river mouths in the basin is experiencing a substantially low adriatic discharge during all years coupled models show higher discharges in winter for about 600 m3 s and lower in summer almost zero compared to the new adriatic river climatology 500 m3 s used in med12f2 in the northern adriatic north the seasonal cycle is different experiencing minima in february and august september and maxima in spring and late autumn the spring peak largely driven by the snow melt raicich 1996 in med8f med12f1 and med12f3 is shifted from march april to may june compared to med12f2 but properly reproduced by the coupled models august december period as well as the autumn peak driven by the precipitation maximum raicich 1996 is underrepresented in all models compared to med12f2 up to 700 m3 s on average the northern adriatic annual discharge rates are highest in med12f2 and lowest in coupled models in the western adriatic west discharges are much lower compared to the other two regions med8f has zero discharge as no river mouths were introduced to the model there in this area med12f1 and med12f3 don t show seasonal cycle since coastal runoff used in the model has only interannual variability variety of river forcing options allow us to study influence of water discharge rates on the model performances 2 1 3 assessment of the wintertime atmospheric forcing wintertime heat losses are responsible for the adriatic dwf which in turn drives the thermohaline circulation in the adriatic ionian basin orlić et al 2006 somot et al 2006 heat fluxes are introduced in the med8f model through dynamically downscaled ecmwf era 40 reanalysis called arperav2 herrmann and somot 2008 herrmann et al 2010 that has 50 km of resolution over the 1961 2013 period the three med12f models are forced with 12 km aldera which is a regional downscaled era interim reanalysis hamon et al 2016 covering the period from 1979 2013 averaged november december january february ndjf net heat fluxes fig 3 over two dense water formation areas northern and southern adriatic denoted with red squares in fig 1 reveal their synchrony in interannual variability their average values are similar in all models over the southern adriatic with the lowest values found in med8f but differ in the northern adriatic where ndjf average heat losses are higher by about 20 30 for coupled models compared to the forced ones also the southern adriatic average heat losses are larger than in the northern adriatic during wintertime e g average med8c1 heat fluxes equal to 129 w m2 in the northern adriatic and 149 w m2 in the southern adriatic not shown amongst other larger difference between air temperature and sst is affecting larger wintertime heat losses in the deep southern adriatic during the coldest part of the year december february in contrast the shallow northern adriatic is rapidly cooled during autumn when heat losses are not at their maximum average ndjf net heat fluxes over the whole adriatic sea for the analysed period equal to 161 155 155 154 146 146 and 130 w m2 for the med8f med8c1 med8c2 med8c3 med12f1 med12f2 and med12f3 respectively the flux rates are following the literature where old climatology may 1982 is estimating average ndjf net heat losses over the whole adriatic basin to be 173 w m2 artegiani et al 1997a recent estimates based on era 40 reanalysis data set reduced these heat losses by 10 20 cardin and gačić 2003 with yearly adriatic averaged ndjf flux values between 133 and 165 w m2 depending on the used methodology yet a comparison of different heat flux estimations comes with limitations as various data sets spatial coverage methodologies and time periods are represented in the literature however we conclude that all the forcing datasets used in this study lie in the range of already published estimates with arpera having stronger and aldera milder forcing 2 2 observational data in situ temperature and salinity collected at 22 stations have been used for evaluation of ocean simulations most of the stations 15 of them are located in the northern adriatic spanning over three transects na nb nc fig 1 the data have been collected monthly at standard oceanographic depths 0 5 10 20 m and bottom during 1980 2012 there were 144 507 and 435 cruises over na nb and nc transects respectively temperature was measured using reversing thermometers and salinity was determined using mohr and knudsen s method supić et al 2012 in the middle and southern adriatic 5 stations are located along the palagruža sill ps transect and two individual stations within the two adriatic depressions sap station d1200 and jabuka pit station jp at the ps transect data were measured with quasi monthly resolution at the northernmost stations p1 and p2 and seasonally at stations p3 p5 during the given time period 237 241 93 86 and 91 samplings were taken at stations p1 to p5 respectively at station jp the data were collected mostly on a seasonal basis till 1990 followed by occasional surveying only 93 profiles at station d1200 the data were sampled quasi uniformly over all seasons throughout the common period 86 profiles at the ps transect and stations jp and d1200 temperature was determined using reversing thermometers until 1998 while salinity was determined with rs 10 induction salinometers afterwards idroanut 36 and seabird 25 ctd probes were in use samplings were performed at standard oceanographic depths 0 10 20 30 50 75 100 150 200 300 400 500 600 800 1000 m and bottom whenever a change in methodology occurred instruments were intercalibrated potential density anomalies pdas with a reference pressure of zero were estimated using teos 10 algorithms the data have already been statistically quality checked and used in a number of studies vilibić 2003 vilibić et al 2011 2012 2013 supić et al 2012 mihanović et al 2015 dunić et al 2018 even though all the series started before 1980 this study focuses on the common period of all models 1980 2012 for the bios related analysis we used daily absolute dynamic topography adt multimission gridded data that cover the time period from 1993 2012 this data was taken from the aviso web site http www aviso altimetry fr regional smdt med 2014 in the duacs 2014 v15 0 3 models overall performance spatial distribution of the 1980 2012 averaged bottom potential temperatures salinities and pdas fig 4 reveal a similarity in their spatial patterns but with an offset between mean values compared to other models med8f has highest bottom temperatures average of 14 7 c and highest salinities average of 38 5 resulting in high densities over the entire domain average of 28 7 kg m3 the three coupled models are rather similar with averaged bottom temperatures between 13 9 c and 14 2 c salinity averages between 38 2 and 38 3 and pda averages of about 28 7 kg m3 the three forced models of higher resolution med12f1 f3 reproduce lower bottom temperatures average of 14 5 c compared to med8f when it comes to salinity two forced models med12f1 f2 reproduce slightly higher bottom salinities than coupled models average of 38 3 whereas med12f3 reproduces lowest bottom salinities of all models average of 38 1 therefore having lower bottom pda 28 5 kg m3 compared to med12f1 f2 models about 28 6 kg m3 temperature salinity and density average spatial distributions do not reveal the northern adriatic as a dwf site in fact bottom northern adriatic waters are simulated to have the lowest densities of the entire adriatic waters this is not unrealistic as dense waters generated in the northern adriatic are advected towards the middle and southern adriatic within a few tens of days after generation thus having a very short residence time in the north mihanović et al 2013 successfulness of dwf reproduction in the northern adriatic will be checked later by focusing on the analysis of thermohaline properties simulated during common dwf periods moving to the south a pool of cold and dense waters can be found at the bottom of jabuka pit this pool is particularly pronounced in coupled model runs med8c1 3 with average temperatures of 12 5 c and densities of 29 2 kg m3 the same applies to the bottom layers of the southern adriatic pit although waters which are modelled to reside there have higher temperatures and salinities in average 1 5 c and 0 2 higher and lower densities in average 0 3 kg m3 lower than the jabuka pit waters the coastal north eastern waters are resolved only with higher resolution med12f models depths in this area are higher than at the open northern adriatic waters with 1 2 c lower temperatures than in the adjacent open adriatic waters it should be noted that this area has only recently been recognized as the secondary northern adriatic dense water formation site mihanović et al 2013 due to the strong heat losses driven by severe bora reaching up to 2000 w m2 during extreme bora wind events janeković et al 2014 contrary to the expectations med12f3 simulation has very low pda values at the bottom of this area 28 3 kg m3 mostly due to unrealistically low salinities 37 3 caused by the larger freshwater load compared to other models oppositely and in agreement with the recent observations med12f1 and med12f2 classify this deep coastal region as an area where the adriatic dense waters are generated if we compare the model runs which differ in only one parameter we can conclude i inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c3 vs non inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c2 does not create any significant changes of bottom thermohaline properties and ii inclusion of the new river climatology in med12f2 vs old river climatology in med12f1 only slightly increases salinities in the eastern coastal area resulting in higher pda next we look at seasonal temperature salinity and pda cycles at several depths over the entire domain of the adriatic sea fig 5 the shape of the seasonal cycles is consistent between the models but there is an offset between mean values expectedly temperature seasonal cycle fig 5a peaks in august at surface layers and in december at bottom layers maximum temperatures in the intermediate layer are reached in november december marking this as the time when combination of vertical mixing and inflow of the liw to the adriatic strongly influences the temperature increase throughout the water column coupled models exhibit lower temperatures of about 0 5 1 0 c than the forced ones due to the overestimated surface shortwave and latent heat losses sevault et al 2014 this difference is most pronounced during february april and reduced during late autumn and early winter october december temperature vertical changes are more pronounced in coupled models than in forced ones salinity seasonal distribution among different models is again of similar shape but with an offset between mean values fig 5b model with highest salinity throughout the water column is med8f average salinity changes between 37 9 at surface and 38 7 at 100 m where an inflow of saline liw is occurring and model with consistently low salinity is med12f3 average salinity at surface and at 100 m is about 37 5 as for other models the offset varies vertically coupled models have i higher salinities averages of 37 8 37 9 than med12f1 2 models averages of 37 6 37 8 at the surface ii significantly lower salinities at 100 m depths averages of 38 5 38 6 than med12f1 2 models averages of 38 7 and iii similar salinities as med12f1 2 models in the bottom layer vertical salinity gradients are somewhat less pronounced in coupled models than in forced models for example maximum salinity changes between 38 1 at the surface and 38 6 at the liw intrusion depth in med8c2 whereas it changes between 37 9 at the surface and 38 7 at the liw intrusion depth in med12f2 model surface salinity fig 5b has a substantial seasonal cycle with minimum in may june lagging for one month after the river discharge peak which normally occurs in april may raicich 1996 vilibić et al 2016 these less saline waters are then spread over the thermally driven stratified waters particularly over the northern adriatic franco and michelato 1992 supić et al 2004 at 100 m salinity increases from february march to september october this corresponds to a known period in which a few months after the adriatic dwf events the adriatic thermohaline circulation strengthens thus increasing advection of saline waters from the northern ionian sea orlić et al 2006 the salinity difference between models is larger than its seasonal cycle the near bottom salinity generally follows seasonality of intermediate waters keeping also the spread of average values between the models for about 0 4 between med8f and med12f3 over the water column simulated pdas are largest in three coupled models medc1 c3 and in med8f model average of about 28 4 kg m3 forced models generally reproduce waters with lower densities with the lowest values found in the fresh med12f3 model average pda changes from 28 1 kg m3 in med12f3 to 28 3 kg m3 in med12f1 fig 5c february march maximum bottom pdas relevant for the dwf range from 28 9 kg m3 in med12f3 to 29 2 kg m3 in med8f and coupled models as for seasonal changes the pda cycle fig 5c generally follows temperature cycle even in intermediate layers influenced by the liw where salinity changes oppose the temperature changes the largest pda values in the intermediate layer are reached in march adjoining temperature minimum as deep convection surpasses these depths in the most parts of the adriatic this also applies to the deep layers as the pda is driven by dense water generation that spreads rapidly in bottom layers after its generation during winter particularly in the northern adriatic although the seasonality in the pda is dominantly driven by temperature the overall pda differences between models are driven by both salinity and temperature when comparing only the model sets which differ in two parameters we conclude i inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c3 vs non inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c2 created minor opposing changes in temperature and salinity distribution resulting in almost identical density distributions ii inclusion of the new river climatology in med12f2 vs old river climatology in med12f1 slightly lowered surface salinity and slightly increased intermediate and bottom salinities resulting in almost negligible differences of averaged pdas between these two models plots of interannual distribution of salinity along the 40on transect crossing eastern side between 19 1 19 9oe of the otranto strait fig 6 a are used to discover how different models reproduce advection of the saline liw to the adriatic med8f and med12f3 have consistently highest and lowest salinities of all models average over the eastern side of the otranto strait of 38 9 kg m3 and 38 6 kg m3 respectively coupled models in particular med8c2 and med8c3 in general have higher salinities than forced models except med8f most models simulate periods with higher inflow of saline waters over most of the water column i in med8f model there are two prolonged periods with increased salinities over most of the water column during 1984 1993 and during 2002 2012 ii in coupled models inflow of highly saline water is intensified during 1996 2000 and during 2002 2012 iii in med12f1 and med12f2 similar inflow over the entire water column is intensified only during 2005 2008 being in good agreement with oddo and guarnieri 2011 who ascribed it to the production of saline water masses in the aegean sea and their effect on the liw pathways and iv no period with inflow of saline waters over the entire water column is reproduced by med12f3 simulation the liw inflow is occurring at greater depths in med8 models mostly between 200 and 600 m with s 38 7 than in med12 models mostly between 50 and 400 m with s 38 8 except med12f3 where liw inflow to the adriatic is very weak and above 200 m the observations and previous numerical simulations document the core of liw inflow at depths between 150 and 400 m gačić et al 1996 malanotte rizzoli et al 1997 kršinić and grbec 2002 manca et al 2002 and between 150 600 m oddo and guarnieri 2011 gunduz et al 2013 mantziafou and lascaratos 2004 respectively liw inflow is very weak in med12f3 model yet a broad salinity maxima are found in the deep layers of med12f3 model below 700 m these maxima were not found in other simulations hovmoller salinity diagrams for the deepest section of the palagruža sill station ps3 are shown in fig 6b palagruža sill is a key area for the adriatic water mass exchange and for the liw advection towards the middle and the northern adriatic buljan and zore armanda 1976 martin et al 2009 very strong interannual salinity variability is simulated to occur at this location as expected model with the highest simulated salinities is med8f averaged value of 38 7 and with the lowest is med12f3 averaged value of 38 4 salinities of forced models med12f1 f2 are higher average of 38 6 than salinities of coupled models averages of 38 4 38 5 similarly to the otranto most models show periods characterized by the presence of very saline waters i in med8f model these periods are again very long saline waters are present over palagruža sill during 1984 1992 and during 2002 2012 ii in coupled models saline waters are present during 1984 1992 1994 and during 2000 2006 and iii in med12f1 and med12f2 saline waters are present during 1984 1994 and during 2000 2008 although periods with slightly increased salinities are reproduced no period with the liw inflow over entire water column is reproduced by med12f3 model in the upper 150 m simulated temporal salinity changes at the palagruža sill are matching the ones simulated over the otranto strait this implies that the changes found at the palagruža sill transect are mostly driven by the water mass exchange between the adriatic and the ionian to better understand the behaviour of presented models regarding the liw intrusions at the otranto strait particularly of med12f3 and its high negative salinity bias that propagates throughout the entire adriatic sea we examined the mean vertical salinity distribution at the otranto strait transect crossing at 40on fig 7 models with lower horizontal and vertical resolution med8f med8c1 c3 are simulating the liw core at greater depths 300 350 m than med12 models med12f1 f3 200 250 m also the liw inflow is stretched to higher depths in the med8 models up to 800 m all models peak in salinity and liw inflow along the eastern side of the transect as found in observations while the outflow of the adw is present at the bottom and western slope of the transect the only exception is med12f3 which has the salinity maximum at the bottom of the transect and a very weak liw inflow and outflow found on the western and eastern parts of the transect respectively in surface to intermediate layers not shown also no adw outflow is present at the bottom of the transect altogether much weaker cross transect currents are reproduced by med12f3 than by other models not shown as med12f3 salinity distribution in the sap is similar not shown with salinity maxima found near the bottom 600 m it seems that the inflowing liw was denser than the residing waters in the sap at the beginning of the simulation due to overfreshening of the adriatic waters leading to vertical instabilities and liw sinking to the bottom of the sap this in turn i restricted the dwf to the upper layers and reduced the mixed layer depth mld see section 5 1 2 ii reduced the adw density characterizing it with much lower salinities as not preconditioned by the liw that sunk to the bottom and iii induced a very weak adw outflow at the otranto strait transect altogether a substantial deviation in reproduction of the adriatic ionian circulation is performed by med12f3 influencing as well the bios regimes in the northern ionian sea see section 5 2 when comparing the model runs which differ in only one parameter both for otranto strait fig 6a and palagruža sill fig 6b neither i inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c3 vs non inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c2 nor ii inclusion of the new river climatology in med12f2 vs old river climatology in med12f1 significantly changed the salinity distribution 4 model validation on observations 4 1 northern adriatic temperature and salinity data coming out of seven regional ocean simulations were evaluated with the available in situ data collected at three northern adriatic transects na nb nc representing northern middle and eastern parts of the area the stations are enumerated following w e direction for the transects na and nb and following n s direction for the nc transect fig 1 modelled temperature and salinity coming from the nearest grid points have been used for comparison to the observations vertically averaged model to observation temperature salinity and pda biases for all three northern transects are shown in fig 8 in general temperature is overestimated by all models most by med8f with averaged bias of 1 1 c and least by med8c1 with averaged bias of 0 5 c temperature overestimation is more pronounced near the western coast left parts of na and nb transects and the northernmost part transect na and less pronounced along the easterly placed nc transect the strong positive temperature bias is driven by higher subsurface and bottom temperatures which is a result of deeper than observed modelled seasonal thermocline particularly in med8 models in which it almost reached the bottom at the shallowest northern and western parts not shown the improper thermocline reproduction is presumably the result of insufficient vertical resolution of z models over wide northern adriatic shelf where med8 and med12 models have only 5 6 and 14 16 layers respectively coupling strategies are reducing the strength of local vertical mixing which was found higher in forced models except for med12f3 by reducing the heat losses and wind effects to the sea surface pullen et al 2007 ličer et al 2016 for that reason averaged mld over the adriatic sea in coupled models is lower than in the forced ones 27 m vs 31 m regarding salinity forced models exhibit negative biases in most of the northern adriatic with positive biases present only in the easternmost part nc transect the exception is med12f3 model which as expected for being overly fresh has negative salinity biases at all stations by contrast the coupled models are characterized by positive salinity biases at all stations except those in the northernmost part stations na1 na2 and partially nc1 positive biases are far largest at nb1 station which is a station closest to the po river delta implying that the po river discharge is not well introduced to the coupled models as seen in fig 2 as well as a consequence of both positive temperature and negative salinity biases the pda is strongly underestimated by forced models particularly in the northern and middle parts of the northern adriatic with the pdas bias reaching more than 0 6 kg m3 at some stations the only parts where forced models experience lower negative or slightly positive pda biases are at stations in the southern part of the nc transect stations nc3 nc5 following positive salinity biases coupled models exhibit different pda bias properties as corresponding salinity and temperature biases have same signs and thus opposite influence at the most of the northern adriatic in its southern and eastern parts nb transect and southern part of the nc transect pda biases in coupled models are slightly positive 0 1 0 2 kg m3 while they are negative at remaining points largest at the na1 station about 0 4 kg m3 when comparing the model runs which differ in one parameter we conclude that both i inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c3 vs non inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c2 and ii inclusion of the new river climatology in med12f2 vs old river climatology in med12f1 produce only minor changes in average thermohaline properties of the northern adriatic 4 2 middle and south adriatic multi model evaluation in the middle and southern parts of the adriatic was performed on in situ data measured along the palagruža sill transect stations ps1 ps5 enumerated from n to s fig 1 and at the jabuka pit jp and sap d1200 stations at the palagruža sill transect temperature bias reveals a distinction between forced and coupled models fig 9 a the coupled models have a negative bias at the surface up to 1 3 c which slightly decreases in the intermediate layer up to 0 8 c where the liw is advected from the southeast negative temperature bias further decreases towards the bottom where it stays between 0 and 0 4 c except at the station ps4 by contrast forced models have a positive and a negative surface temperature bias near the northern and southern parts of the transect respectively with increasing positive bias in intermediate 50 m and bottom layers where it surpasses 0 8 c that refers particularly to the med8f model as for salinity fig 9b throughout the whole water column most positive salinity biases are estimated for med8f model averaged values of 0 3 0 1 and 0 2 for the surface intermediate and bottom layer respectively and most negative for med12f3 model average values of 0 15 0 18 and 0 18 for the surface intermediate and bottom layer respectively for coupled models negative salinity biases are considerable and present throughout the water column at most of the stations with higher absolute values in intermediate and bottom layers up to 0 3 implying that liw reproduced by the coupled models is not saline enough on the other hand salinity biases found in forced models especially in med12f1 f2 in particular in the intermediate and bottom layers are of smaller absolute values up to 0 1 in med12f1 and f2 implying that liw characteristics are reproduced better by the forced models summing temperature and salinity effects pda biases are positive at the surface switching to negative in the intermediate and bottom layers in all models except med12f3 where pda biases are negative throughout the entire water column at almost all transect stations fig 9c the highest bottom pda underestimation over 0 2 kg m3 is expectedly found in med12f3 model primarily as a result of an underestimated salinity more than 0 2 aside for this model other models have a weak med8f up to 0 07 kg m3 or moderate e g med12f1 and med12f2 up to 0 15 kg m3 negative bias in deep layers that particularly refers to the bottom of the ps3 and ps5 stations where the dense waters originating from the northern adriatic are crossing the sill predominantly in spring and summer vilibić et al 2004 marini et al 2016 indicating that their pdas are underestimated by both forced and coupled models temperature biases found in jabuka pit a collector of dense waters artegiani et al 1997a vilibić et al 2004 are particularly pronounced in its near bottom layers fig 10 a left panel these layers are deeper than the palagruža sill and therefore are not directly influenced by the advection of incoming intermediate liw waters the positive temperature bias at 250 m ranges between 1 1 c and 1 2 c for coupled models to 1 5 1 8 c for forced models implying that all models either fail to reproduce accumulation of dense naddw at the bottom of the jabuka pit or that they reproduce insufficiently cold naddw at the intermediate layer where the liw advection normally occurs temperature biases are lower with negative biases reproduced by coupled models and zero or positive biases reproduced by forced models again implying that liw intrusions and characteristics are reproduced better by forced than by coupled models yet all models follow the same shape of vertical profiles of the temperature bias but with an offset between mean values not largely changing in rate up to 100 m and then strongly increasing towards the bottom similarly the shape of salinity biases fig 10b left panel differs only in an offset between models that is preserved through the water column a concave bulge particularly pronounced in coupled models and med12f3 may be found in intermediate layers 50 150 m revealing a salinity underestimation of the liw by these models together with a large negative temperature bias it indicates that coupled models and med12f3 do not properly represent either the advection of liw towards the middle adriatic or that liw source characteristics were not properly reproduced or were changed over its pathway to the adriatic the pda bias fig 10c left panel is mostly driven by the temperature effect being highest in the near bottom layers in the med12f3 model 0 4 kg m3 and lowest in forced models 0 2 0 3 kg m3 in intermediate layers the pda bias is much lower as the effects of temperature and salinity to density are contrasting for coupled models and med12f3 while temperature and salinity biases are rather low for forced models the d1200 station is characterized by negative temperature biases at the thermocline depth 20 30 m up to 1 8 c fig 10a right panel simulated by all models then the biases become less negative or slightly positive depending on the model toward the middle layers up to 50 m resulting in overestimated 0 2 0 3 c temperatures in forced models except med12f3 and largely underestimated temperatures 0 4 to 0 6 c by coupled models biases become more positive or less negative towards the bottom of the pit with smallest absolute biases simulated for med8c2 and med8c3 models 0 1 c and highest for med8f 0 5 c all four forced models show positive temperature biases at the bottom of d1200 implying that dense waters which are coming to the pit from the northern adriatic through sinking along its perimeter carniel et al 2016 chiggiato et al 2016 are of lower volumes or higher temperatures than observed the most negative salinity bias up to 0 2 fig 10b right panel is found between 100 and 500 m where liw advection has its maximum vilibić and orlić 2001 this is particularly pronounced in med8c1 and med12f3 models lowest salinity biases at the liw inflow depth are obtained with med12f1 f2 forced models in all models salinity bias becomes less negative or more positive toward the bottom similarly to the temperature bias the pda biases fig 10c right panel mostly originate from the temperature biases and are thus substantially positive in the surface layer and becoming negative at the bottom of the pit 1000 1200 m the 800 1200 m pda bias difference is around 0 04 kg m3 for all models but med12f3 for which is around 0 07 kg m3 when comparing the model sets which differ in one parameter we conclude that at all three studied locations jabuka pit palagruža sill transect and d1200 i inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c3 vs non inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c2 and ii inclusion of the new river climatology in med12f2 vs old river climatology in med12f1 produced only minor changes to the average thermohaline properties in the middle and south adriatic 5 model validation of processes 5 1 adriatic dense water formation 5 1 1 northern adriatic dense waters are dominantly generated in the northern adriatic during late winter mostly in february franco and michelato 1992 artegiani et al 1997a vilibić and supić 2005 kuzmić et al 2006 when waters with lowest temperatures are found there supić et al 2004 therefore biases for temperature salinity and pda collected for february have been used as a proxy for successfulness of dwf reproduction separately at the surface and at the bottom fig 11 if comparing fig 11 to fig 8 in which we have shown northern adriatic biases averaged over the entire period we can notice the same behaviour of biases of all forced models but opposite behaviour of biases of coupled models in february coupled models reproduce colder biases up to 1 1 c fig 10a and only slightly fresher biases up to 0 14 water masses with particularly low in absolute value biases of salinity and pda at bottom layers fig 11b and c this implies that dwf in the northern adriatic is reproduced better with coupled models than with the forced ones coupled models work especially well over the western part of transects nb1 nb3 where both temperature and salinity biases and consequently pda biases are of lowest absolute values this is particularly rewarding as dense waters are known to be dominantly generated in the central and western section of the northern adriatic shelf within a cyclonic eddy driven largely by the bora wind bergamasco et al 1999 beg paklar et al 2001 upon generation these waters leave northern adriatic area along the western adriatic coast vilibić et al 2004 mihanović et al 2013 thus model validation along the western part of the northern adriatic is more relevant for dwf validation contrary forced models reproduce february temperature and salinity biases up to 1 7 c and 0 6 fig 11a and b comparable to temperature and salinity biases estimated for the entire year fig 8a and b this strongly implies that northern adriatic dwf is not so well reproduced by the forced models this is somewhat surprising especially for med12 models which are forced by the atmospheric fields of higher resolution 12 km 3 hourly than are atmospheric fields used for forcing or coupling of med8 models 50 km daily looking a bit more in detail into salinity biases we notice that salinity february biases of forced models med12f1 f2 fig 11b exhibit quite high negative surface biases in the western part of the northern adriatic up to 2 2 which is an indicator of much higher spreading of river waters primarily of po river introduced in all models from the shoreline these low salinity waters spread over the dwf site thus presumably weakening or preventing dwf in that part of the northern adriatic in med12f1 f2 by contrast surface salinity bias in coupled models is positive 0 3 0 5 along the central and western northern adriatic implying that the low salinity coastal current is suppressed more to the shoreline following the observations kourafalou 1999 beg paklar et al 2001 better reproduction of dense water by the coupled models can be perceived from q q plots in which all northern adriatic measurements are compared to the modelled values fig 12 for all models systematic offsets between measured and modelled temperature are present through the data however forced models have larger errors both at intermediate and at higher tails of temperature distributions fig 12a this particularly applies to the lowest february temperatures associated with high heat losses and strong dwf where an overestimation in temperature by forced models is rather strong up to 1 2 c coupled models perform best in the range 9 0 11 0 c and around 12 0 c while larger temperature underestimations are present at low temperatures associated with the dwf salinity is fairly reproduced by all models at the upper tail of the distribution where salinities are higher than 38 0 with the best reproduction achieved by the coupled models these models keep fair reproduction of the february lower salinities as well from 37 0 to 38 0 whereas forced models are underestimating them as for the lowest salinity values 37 0 present mostly in the po influenced westernmost part of the northern adriatic coupled models strongly overestimate these values while forced models slightly underestimate them coupled models are successfully reproducing highest pdas values above 28 2 kg m3 fig 12c but overestimating lower pdas mostly due to the salinity overestimation salinity also strongly affects the pda bias of forced models for values below 28 8 kg m3 with the pda of forced models underestimated for most values exception is med8f model in which pda of the densest waters is overestimated spatial characteristics and the dynamics of modelled dwf might be assessed from the bottom pda distribution during a period with a documented strong dwf like february 2012 during this period record breaking densities were measured in the northern adriatic mihanović et al 2013 raicich et al 2013 benetazzo et al 2014 janeković et al 2014 ličer et al 2016 the average bottom pda distribution obtained for february 2012 by all models is compared to the pda distribution fig 13 extracted from a high resolution ocean modelling system 2 km roms ocean model driven by an 8 km atmospheric aladin forcing by a new river climatology and by daily fields of adriatic forecasting system afs areg model applied at the open boundary at the otranto strait janeković et al 2014 this model run was extensively validated on the available measurements and shown to reproduce temporal and spatial characteristics of all observed dwf phases a dry preconditioning with low precipitation and river discharges during preceding year mihanović et al 2013 the dwf occurring in the cyclone anticyclone bipole over the whole water column zore armanda and gačić 1987 beg paklar et al 2001 kuzmić et al 2006 and spreading of dense water mass along the western coastline towards jabuka pit and the sap vilibić and mihanović 2013 mihanović et al 2013 marini et al 2016 when compared to the roms model the pda values are underestimated in most of the domain by all models except med8f fig 13 where they reach their maximum in the northernmost and shallowest part of the shelf exactly where the record breaking densities were measured mihanović et al 2013 this does not however instantly imply that med8f model is optimal for reproduction of dwf processes the fact is that this model is overly saline both due to the water mass characteristics entering the adriatic through otranto fig 6a and dunić et al 2018 and to low river discharges fig 2 with just two northern adriatic river mouths introduced to this model on the other hand med12f1 and med12f2 have much less saline waters entering the adriatic through otranto strait and better river climatology particularly the med12f2 in which a combination of river discharges measured during the last decade and databases based on ludwig et al 2009 were used in spite of better salinity content med12f1 f2 were not able to properly reproduce dwf in the open northern adriatic even though a slight improvement is visible in the med12f2 model taking form of bottom waters with higher densities when compared to med12f1 as implied during discussion related to fig 11 this might be due to improper introduction of the po river outflow also it should be noted that river discharges were imposed as constant after 2001 in all forced models except med12f2 both med12f1 and med12f2 models were able to reproduce secondary pda maximum present in the eastern coastal area quite well the last forced model med12f3 properly reproduces spatial distribution with maximum pda in the northernmost part of the shelf but with a distinct offset compared to roms model we should keep in mind that this model has far lowest e p r budget and thus much lower overall salinities for the same reason no dwf was found in the eastern coastal area of med12f3 model as the coastal runoff is contributing to the largest freshwater load of all models in this area compared to med12f2 averaged discharge rates in med12f3 are for 270 kg m3 higher also the med8 model domains do not cover the coastal eastern adriatic due to their coarser resolution and thus cannot reproduce dwf in this area this is a significant shortcoming since it has been shown that dense waters generated at this location contributed up to about 40 to the total production of dense waters in 2012 janeković et al 2014 conclusively a smaller area in which dwf is occurring presumably results in additional underestimation of northern adriatic dwf in med8 models as for coupled models although they are reproducing denser waters than med12f1 f2 in the open northern adriatic dwf maximum is not at a proper position or of a proper value maximum pda and therefore the maximum dwf site in coupled models is placed off the kvarner bay at locations where the strongest bora wind jet is present so called senj jet janeković et al 2014 as the northern adriatic dwf is primarily driven by strong heat losses beg paklar et al 2001 mihanović et al 2013 some model differences may be associated with spatial distribution of heat losses fig 14 models with coarser resolution of their atmospheric forcing med8 exhibit a broad maximum in february 2012 spanning off the eastern coastal area with absolute values of this maximum higher than absolute values of heat losses modelled by roms model but with no real signature of the gulf of trieste jet or senj jet the forced models driven by aldera high resolution forcing med12f show more realistic spatial details and in particular the signature of the three identified jets however in med12 models the northern heat loss maximum the senj jet is weaker than the southern one the sukošan jet that is contrasting the high resolution model used by janeković et al 2014 which reproduced twice larger heat losses within the senj jet than within the sukošan jet also heat losses within the bora banner originating in the gulf of trieste in which bora blows over the shallowest part of the northern adriatic influencing the generation of the densest waters in 2012 mihanović et al 2013 raicich et al 2013 janeković et al 2014 are not reproduced to be of sufficient strength by med12 models conclusively coupled models are better reproducing the dense water distribution and pda values at open northern adriatic than forced models due to overall larger heat losses and higher salinities thus to properly reproduce northern adriatic dwf we need to use both coupled models and atmospheric models of higher resolutions with an emphasis on the latter which are able to simulate spatial distribution of heat losses more realistically in this area according to bias analysis figs 11 and 12 increasing heat losses is slightly more important than increasing spatial resolution as models with higher heat losses med8c1 c3 reproduce dwf better than models with higher resolution med12f1 f2 much like for discussion of reproduction of general yearly thermohaline properties of the adriatic it seems that neither i inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c3 vs non inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c2 nor ii inclusion of the new river climatology in med12f2 vs old river climatology in med12f1 influenced northern adriatic dwf however an extension of the domain to the kvarner bay by med12 models of which med12f2 is performing somewhat better surely has an effect on northern adriatic dwf rates 5 1 2 southern adriatic the sap is a place where adw is generated through open convection processes in february and early march e g gačić et al 2002 one way to measure the strength of the open convection process is the mld which has been estimated for all models using the turbocline criterion somot et al 2006 unfortunately there are no in situ stations from which reliable long term mld estimations might be obtained for the area as d1200 is positioned at the perimeter of the deep convection area dunić et al 2018 in addition a number of cross adriatic temperature and salinity measurements were carried out since the 1970 s vilibić and orlić 2001 indicating that the mld did not surpass 900 m while atmosphere ocean buoy has been operational in the southern part of the pit only during the last decade bozzano et al 2013 thus the modelled mld will be compared to the existing literature and mld estimates coming from certain field campaigns fig 15 shows interannual variability of spatial and temporal maximum mld at the sap that was determined from the daily modelled mld values for all models maximum values are reached in february the mean maximum yearly mlds over the whole period 1980 2012 are 844 m 673 m 641 m 636 m 738 m 733 m and 477 m for med8f med8c1 med8c2 med8c3 med12f1 med12f2 and med12f3 respectively thus med8f has generally the largest mld while med12f3 has the lowest as for other models the mld is modelled to be higher in coupled models for years associated with very strong heat losses fig 3 in 1984 coupled models gave maximum mld of 1100 m and med12f1 f2 forced models gave maximum of 800 950 m in 1993 coupled models gave maximum mld of 1200 m and med12f1 and med12f2 models gave maximum of 1100 m furthermore the range of values is considerably different between coupled and med12f1 f2 models e g the mld varies between 200 and 1200 m in med8c2 and between 500 and 1100 m in med12f1 vilibić and orlić 2001 documented the mld reaching 800 m in 1987 manca and bregant 1998 displayed the mld reaching 600 m in 1996 gačić et al 2002 estimated mld depth at 900 m 35 m low convective year and 300 m in 1992 1997 and 1998 respectively which is all in good agreement with the coupled models aside for 1998 vilibić and šantić 2008 documented the mld depth in 2006 to about 650 m while mihanović et al 2013 investigated argo profiling float data in the winter of 2012 and estimated the mld at around 500 m the latter being in agreement with med12f3 by contrast the absence of the open convection has not been frequently investigated with recent winter of 2015 for which the maximum mld has been estimated to 250 300 m lučić et al 2017 and abovementioned winter of 1998 for which mld has been estimated to 35 m gačić et al 2002 in spite of the fact that observations might underestimate the real value due to undersampling i e lack of sampling at periods of intense water formation it still appears that mixing is much stronger in models than in reality aside for med12f3 model for which it was simulated to be weaker one potential reason for mld overestimation during severe winters by the presented models might be an underestimation of the northern adriatic dwf detected by the d1200 biases fig 9 as these waters are found to fill the near bottom layers below 800 m in the sap bensi et al 2013 querin et al 2013 chiggiato et al 2016 langone et al 2016 increasing the vertical stability of deep layers and preventing deep convection reaching the bottom consequently the modelled stability of deep waters 800 1200 m is lowered allowing for the surface forcing to penetrate much higher in depth in the models the next culprit might be liw misreproduction in intermediate layers which in reality changes the stability of the waters hit by vertical mixing during severe wintertime outbreaks and open ocean convection and which are misrepresented in studied climate models in particular in coupled ones too strong heat losses might also be a reason for enhanced mixing as well as the problem with model parametrisation and bathymetry representation which might cause too strong vertical mixing in particular over steep areas like the sap dutour sikirić et al 2009 all simulations show strong interannual and decadal dwf variability fig 15 especially prominent in the coupled models the correlation factors between averaged ndjf net heat fluxes estimated for the southern adriatic fig 3 and the yearly maximum mld are around 0 8 for all models significant at the 99 level this denotes the strong effect of the atmospheric forcing in shaping the dwf on an interannual scale which is in agreement with gulf of lions studies l hévéder et al 2013 somot et al 2018 after 1993 a decade with weaker convective activity occurred supported by lower ndjf net heat fluxes yet the decadal variability is also affected by the bios which may affect dwf preconditioning once generated the adw flows to the bottom of the otranto strait towards the deep eastern mediterranean roether and schlitzer 1991 robinson et al 2001 to estimate adw outflow cumulative southward annual transports over the 40 latitude stretching across the otranto strait above a certain pda threshold have been estimated fig 16 as shown before all models differ in their mean salinity values that affect the pdas inside the adriatic for that reason we determined the pda threshold for each model separately as the 95 percentile of all monthly mean pda values found below 100 m at otranto strait which refers to the seasonal pycnocline depth buljan and zore armanda 1976 the thresholds were found higher and more realistic e g vilibić and orlić 2001 in coupled models 29 23 kg m3 29 26 kg m3 and 29 26 kg m3 for med8c1 med8c2 and med8c3 respectively implying that these models are reproducing denser adriatic water masses the estimated values are in good agreement with observed densities of the southern adriatic deep waters 29 2 kg m3 vilibić and orlić 2001 mantziafou and lascaratos 2008 the pda threshold in med8f was somewhat lower 29 21 kg m3 and the lowest thresholds of 29 16 kg m3 29 16 kg m3 and 29 18 kg m3 were estimated for med12f1 med12f2 and med12f3 respectively all models but med12f3 range the averaged adw transport from approximately 1500 km3 yr to 17 000 km3 yr with substantial interannual variability fig 16 these estimates are in accordance with the estimations based on multi year current measurements in the otranto strait that may vary substantially between years 3 150 13 000 km3 yr gačić et al 1996 2002 and box model estimates for 1975 1976 9 500 12 500 km3 yr vilibić and orlić 2002 considering all models as an ensemble 1984 1987 1992 1993 2004 2008 and 2012 are the years with the strongest adw transports with the best agreement between models reached in 1993 2004 and 2006 in 1992 extremely strong adw transport is reproduced by med8f while missed in other models no adw transport is reproduced from the mid 1990s till early 2000s matching the post eastern mediterranean transient emt phase characterized by the presence of fresher waters in the whole adriatic vilibić et al 2012 which prevented the generation of the adriatic dense waters adw transports in the otranto strait are mostly connected to the mld decadal variability in the southern adriatic although they differ during some years as an example minor adw transport is modelled for 1981 1982 accompanied by almost complete mixing of the whole sap and mld almost reaching the bottom in particular in med8f model fig 15 however the adw of 1981 1982 is characterized by lower densities february 1982 average pda in the sap is 29 17 kg m3 in med8f than average february average pda in the sap is 29 26 kg m3 in med8f not shown in contrast during years 1993 2004 and 2006 we find both deep mld in the sap and large adw transports in the otranto strait corroborated in contrast to other models adw outflow in the med12f3 model is strongly underestimated or even prevented during some years the correlation factor between the maximum mld in the sap and adw transports is very low 0 1 and insignificant interannual variability of simulated adriatic dwf can also be perceived from the total volumes of dense water masses fig 17 the total volumes were estimated on a monthly basis separately for northern and southern adriatic red squares in fig 1 for the same reason as before differing water mass characteristics between models due to the salinity differences for all models pda thresholds in northern subbasin were calculated as the 95 percentile of all values while we took the same thresholds as for the adw transports fig 16 for the southern subbasin in order to preserve the consistency in the northern adriatic convection processes occur almost every year in all models with variable strength years associated with higher naddw production are 1981 1984 1987 1991 1999 2002 2006 2008 2012 visible in almost all models and most of them described in the literature e g artegiani and salusti 1987 vilibić et al 2004 vilibić and supić 2005 mihanović et al 2013 however the naddw densities are differing between models coupled models in overall are simulating denser naddw compared to the forced ones by 0 3 kg m3 with more realistic pda values except med8f as being too salty which can be ascribed to their ability for better representation of surface heat losses interesting thing to notice is the seasonal variability in total volumes winter maxima and summer minima indicating naddw short residual time period of only several months artegiani and salusti 1987 vilibić 2003 janeković et al 2014 the southern adriatic is showing different interannual variability compared to the northern adriatic but highly correlated with the adw transport at the otranto strait correlation factor between yearly averages of the two time series is between 0 86 and 0 89 significant at 99 level for all models except med12f3 in med12f3 model a weak convection appeared at the beginning of the simulation after which the dense water volumes decreased to almost zero which confirms our previous hypothesis given at the end of section 3 other models are experiencing substantial dwf in the southern adriatic during 1993 and between 2004 2006 which is in a good agreement with the literature e g vilibić and šantić 2008 mantziafou and lascaratos 2008 for these simulations the pdas threshold is in the range of suggested value by the literature 29 2 kg m3 mantziafou and lascaratos 2008 being somewhat better represented in the coupled models comparing models which differ only in one parameter i inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c3 vs non inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c2 does not result in any significant changes of dwf in the southern adriatic ii inclusion of the new river climatology in med12f2 vs old river climatology in med12f1 only slightly changes dwf properties of the southern adriatic visible in both mld and adw otranto transport reason for the latter is that the total runoff volumes between med12f1 and med12f2 are very close 3720 m3 s vs 3630 m3 s however the two models differ in the way of introducing the river discharges see sections 2 1 1 and 2 1 2 the latter doesn t affect the dwf rates however a change in total runoff discharges does verri et al 2018 5 2 adriatic ionian bimodal oscillating system bios modelled ssh is evaluated against the absolute dynamic topography adt aviso product available since 1993 with 1 8 resolution i e the sum of the sea level anomaly and mean dynamic topography as the bios represents a reversal pattern between cyclonic and anticyclonic circulation in the northern ionian sea it has been found that ssh might be used as a proxy for quantification of this process gačić et al 2010 bessiers et al 2013 mihanović et al 2015 reale et al 2017 a simple bios index equaling to the ssh difference between the centre and the perimeter of the northern ionian gyre has been constructed from the observations and successfully related to the adriatic thermohaline biogeochemical and biological decadal oscillations gačić et al 2014 mihanović et al 2015 dunić et al 2018 peharda et al 2016 2018 the bios index defined as the ssh difference between southern and northern boxes in fig 1 is estimated from both aviso measurements and from modelled ssh fig 18 sea level difference sld was computed between central and northern lateral part of the northern ionian fig 1 red squares following the analysis of gačić et al 2014 and mihanović et al 2015 seasonal signal has been removed from the measured and simulated data in order to properly distinguish interannual and decadal variability of the bios regimes positive index implies anticyclonic circulation and advection of less saline waters from the western mediterranean to the adriatic while negative index is associated with the cyclonic circulation strong liw inflow and high salinity conditions in the adriatic two anticyclonic and two cyclonic bios regimes occurred between 1993 and 2012 anticyclonic till 1997 and 2006 2010 cyclonic 1998 2004 and after 2011 forced models strongly underestimate index values during both cyclonic and anticyclonic regimes which is particularly observable between 1995 and 1997 during that time forced models provide near zero index while the measured index is quite high and exhibits a strong anticyclonic circulation in the northern ionian sea simultaneously the coupled models follow observations much better although lagging for a year in switching to the cyclonic bios regime in med8c1 and med8c3 somewhat less pronounced in med8c2 the med12f3 model fails to reproduce all bios regimes this may be due to a weak or blocked dwf outflow through the otranto strait fig 16 which is believed to be the major mechanism responsible for maintaining oscillatory patterns gačić et al 2010 for the second anticyclonic bios regime 2006 2010 all forced models again underestimate the bios index fig 18 on the other hand coupled models slightly overestimate index and prolong the anticyclonic circulation till 2011 med8c1 and med8c3 or even till the end of the investigated period med8c2 for cyclonic regimes the overall difference between modelled and observed bios indexes is much lower than for anticyclonic regimes in summary the coupled models are better in reproducing observations of which med8c3 with included aerosol trend apparently agrees best with observations the reason for this could be in both i the fact that adriatic dwf is stronger in coupled models resulting with adw dense enough up to 29 26 kg m3 compared to forced models whose densities are up to 29 21 kg m3 to cascade into the deep layers of the northern ionian and therefore provoking the reversals and ii sst relaxation term added in forced models that jams the bios reversals this issue is going to be researched in future studies interestingly and finally we see some non negligible differences between models which differ only in one parameter i inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c3 vs non inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c2 results in significantly different duration of anticyclone periods between the two models ii inclusion of the new river climatology in med12f2 vs old river climatology in med12f1 creates less pronounced but still visible differences in the northern ionian sea e g in 1997 1998 and 2008 2009 6 discussion and conclusion a constant development of the mediterranean climate ocean models during the last decade has significantly increased their reliability gualdi et al 2013 ruti et al 2016 however the adriatic sea was often omitted from assessment studies although it is known as the major dwf site for the eastern mediterranean robinson et al 2001 there are several reasons for that of which the major one is unavailability of reliable long term in situ data and the fact that the temporal and spatial scales of dominant processes are lower than in the most of the mediterranean requiring high resolution modelling to properly reproduce processes important for the thermohaline circulation e g the dwf for which high resolution atmospheric models are a requirement beg paklar et al 2001 grisogono and belušić 2009 davolio et al 2015 the first such study has been conducted by dunić et al 2018 who evaluated nemo med8 model med8f in our notation on the 1961 2012 period and found a number of shortcomings in the dwf and bios reproduction due to the model setup in this paper performance of six additional climate ocean simulations with improvements in atmospheric forcing higher spatial and temporal resolution interactive ocean atmosphere coupling river discharge old or new river climatologies interactive river model and resolution horizontal and vertical model nesting approach has been assessed model outputs have been validated on the in situ data whilst the major processes the dwf and the bios have also been evaluated the following conclusions were reached 1 forced models med8f and med12f1 f2 generally overestimate temperature and salinity this overestimation is most pronounced in med8f model where positive temperature and salinity biases are present throughout the water column in all studied areas on the other hand med12f3 overestimates temperature but because of its large shortcoming regarding the e p r budget significantly underestimates salinity throughout the water column in all studied areas 2 coupled models generally underestimate salinity as a result of underrepresented liw with an exception of the northern adriatic surface layer at which salinity is overestimated probably due to the river discharge underrepresentation and interestingly at the otranto strait where salinity is larger than in forced models throughout the water column except med8f 3 when comparing two model sets which differ only in one parameter we conclude that both i inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c3 vs non inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c2 and ii inclusion of the new river climatology in med12f2 vs old river climatology in med12f1 only slightly changed thermohaline properties of the adriatic water masses 4 liw intrusion is modelled better by higher resolution forced models med12f1 f2 than by lower resolution med8 models biases at liw intrusion depth are lowest in med12f1 f2 models in addition to resolution differences this might also be due to the configuration differences between med8 and med12 models affecting the processes in the levantine and ionian basins which influenced the liw depth at the otranto strait found at 200 m in med12f1 f2 models and below 200 m in med8 models unfortunately no long term monitoring of thermohaline properties had been applied in the otranto strait while occasional campaigns put the liw core between 150 and 400 m gačić et al 1996 malanotte rizzoli et al 1997 kršinić and grbec 2002 manca et al 2002 5 all models underestimate dwf in the northern adriatic if looking only at model to measurement bias values dwf is reproduced better with coupled models med8c1 c3 than with forced models med12f1 f3 this is mostly due to the fact that heat losses are 20 30 higher in coupled models than in forced models and thus larger volumes of waters of higher densities are generated in coupled models however forced models better reproduce spatial properties of dwf but this is primarily due to higher resolution of forcing atmospheric model and thus to more realistic spatial representation of atmospheric heat fluxes i e their proper positioning in space and better representation of the domain 6 med12f3 was not able to properly simulate southern adriatic dwf its outflow through the otranto strait and the liw counterflow different oceanic initial conditions than other med12f models low spin up duration and or overestimated e p r budget lower freshwater fluxes led to underrepresented salinity of the whole basin which damped the convection processes in the southern adriatic just a few years after the beginning of the simulation 7 nevertheless all models except med12f3 are unsuccessfully reproducing dwf in the northernmost part of the northern adriatic this is likely due to a strong underestimation in wind and heat fluxes within the trieste bora jet and due to overspreading of river waters to dwf site low salinity waters spread too far from the coastline resulting in an increased stratification that preconditions the dwf and therefore reduce the area where the naddw is generated 8 the only two models in which spatial positioning of primary northern adriatic dwf site is properly reproduced are med8f and med12f3 but with the former one strongly overestimating densities of generated waters due to overestimated salinities within the model and the latter strongly underestimating densities of generated waters due to underestimations of salinity within the model a common difference between med8f and other studied models is the distribution of the river mouths med8f has just two river mouths in the north whereas other models have 7 medc1 c3 or more med12f1 f3 river mouths cumulative river discharge through these river sources is similar for all models fig 2 however apparently too much fresh waters is put into other models at locations to the east of the po river which has been known to overfreshen the water column and not allow for dense water generation at the open northern adriatic dwf site vilibić et al 2016 9 a further proof that the dwf in the northern adriatic has been underestimated may be found in both dense water collectors of the naddw the jabuka pit and the sap where the modelled temperatures have the largest positive bias for all models the direct consequence is an overestimation of the convection depth in the sap where the open convection in most models has been found to reach bottom or near bottom layers while the literature does not record the mld deeper than 900 m 10 coupled models reproduce better the bios index which has been found to describe the decadal oscillations in the adriatic thermohaline properties however a question is if such a simplified index may be a proper proxy for the modelled bios as models were found to inadequately map the spatial patterns related to bios dunić et al 2018 further research should be carried out on this topic by examining the bios spatial patterns mihanović et al 2015 bessiers et al 2013 11 when comparing two model sets which differ only in one parameter we conclude that i inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c3 vs non inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c2 influences bios circulation in the northern ionian but not as much the adriatic dwf processes and that ii inclusion of the new river climatology in med12f2 vs old river climatology in med12f1 does not significantly influence dwf processes in the northern and southern adriatic but slightly influences bios circulation in the northern ionian to rank the importance of different variables and processes the dwf and the bios variables have been correlated to their potential drivers in the ocean wintertime ndjf net heat fluxes over northern and southern areas denoted as squares 1 and 2 in fig 1 salt content and river discharges fig 19 a for the dwf in the northern adriatic the correlation between naddw density february pda and northern adriatic salinity is found to be the most significant for all models a weaker connection is documented between february pda and ndjf net heat fluxes ranking the heat loss effect less important for naddw density than the salt content also different slopes between the february pda and ndjf net heat fluxes indicate that the cooling rate for the same amount of energy loss varies between the models which is largely caused by the effect of different domains between med8 and med12 models lastly the february pda is weakly correlated to river discharges in the northern adriatic ranking the interannual variations in the northern adriatic freshwater load of minor importance to the total dwf in comparison to the salinity content this is due to the bios induced interannual and decadal variations and to the wintertime cooling however as shown before spreading of freshwater masses significantly influences spatial distribution of dwf processes for the dwf occurring in the sap fig 19b the same ranking of contributors for the adw outflow over the otranto strait is suggested as for the northern adriatic but with weaker connections both salinity and ndjf heat losses are equally shaping the modelled adw outflow towards the ionian sea while the rivers don t play a significant role there is a substantial difference between forced and coupled models the forced models are better correlated with february salinity while the coupled models are more dependent on the wintertime heat losses the connection between the bios index and its drivers e g adw outflow through the otranto strait or mld depth in the sap has not however been established with significant levels as indicated by dunić et al 2018 the circulation patterns associated with the bios may spatially differ between the models which may not be properly described by a simple bios index therefore either more complex methods should be applied to capture bios spatial patterns or better variables should be defined for the bios drivers and to ascribe them to the decadal variations in the adriatic thermohaline properties although presenting the state of the art numerical physical oceanographic simulations on a decadal time scales nemo med models are still affected by a number of limitations concerning the adriatic ionian basin these effects are more pronounced as process scales in the adriatic are smaller than in the open mediterranean sea coarse resolution horizontal and vertical is affecting the mixing circulation dynamics and spreading of water masses especially on the shallow areas such as the northern adriatic the higher resolution of the upper layers may resolve the shallow water processes mellor et al 2002 while higher horizontal resolution could improve bottom flow and intense mesoscale cyclonic anticyclonic dynamics that moderates the northern adriatic dwf kuzmić et al 2006 as it was seen in the performance of the med12f3 model because of its higher horizontal resolution of 0 03 this model was able to reproduce the water mass dynamics of the northern adriatic open waters better than other models however the greatest med12f3 shortage was high underestimation of the basin wide salinity content due to the underrepresented e p r budget which led to an overall deficiency of adriatic dwf reproduction this accents a necessity for introduction of high resolution coupled modelling and proper overall freshwater budget for reproduction of processes in coastal regions such as the northern adriatic such as used in short term atmosphere ocean simulations warner et al 2010 another important factor when it comes to the convection processes is their triggering strong and cold wind outbreaks which require high resolution representation of the atmospheric forcing combined with realistic air sea interactions performance of all three coupled models because of their ability to explicitly resolve atmosphere ocean coupling was better than performance of the forced models in a sense of both dwf processes and the northern ionian bimodal reversals still coupled and forced models were of different resolution thus proper assessment of resolution vs coupling effects cannot be achieved however the evaluation of the coupled models at jp and d1200 stations adriatic depressions reveal a drawback in the salinity content inside the adriatic basin which resulted in fresher adw masses it is worth noting that the current 7 simulation ensemble should be considered as an ensemble of opportunity which has not been designed specifically to study the influence of model configuration individual elements on the adriatic sea representation this often precludes the possibility to reach final conclusions on attributing the differences obtained between the ensemble members in light of the documented model performances this study might be used for proper tuning of future models in the adriatic ionian basin for example we can recommend that the future studies should use coupled models with higher resolution and proper river discharges to document mesoscale processes that are common for the adriatic this is particularly relevant for future scenario runs as there is a great uncertainty if the thermohaline circulation i e the dense water formation and the bios will weaken in the future climate as indicated by the observations vilibić et al 2013 through lower ventilation of deep layers that will increase the hypoxic conditions degobbis et al 2000 djakovac et al 2012 a weakening of the circulation might have a disastrous consequence on the whole biogeochemistry of the region thus the trophic chain and fisheries which can be properly addressed only by reliable climate models acknowledgements to all developers of the nemo med models and to all

24058,a performance study of seven regional ocean configurations based on nemo has been carried out for the adriatic sea over a common period 1980 2012 assessed models differ in resolution model physics atmospheric forcing forced vs coupled models and river discharges imposed within the adriatic sea models have been evaluated on the long term temperature and salinity measurements in all of the adriatic sub basins in particular within dense water collectors jabuka pit and south adriatic pit and dense water formation sites northern and southern adriatic adriatic wide salinity content is mostly linked to the proper introduction of the overall water budget rather than to the local river forcing forced models mostly overestimate temperature and salinity values on average coupled models better reproduce the thermohaline properties and processes in particular the adriatic ionian bimodal oscillating system bios reversals and its decadal variability wintertime heat losses are playing major role in defining the adriatic deep water adw transport rates in coupled models while in forced models preconditioning in salinity is the most important factor further on increase of resolution of the atmospheric forcing results in more realistic ocean behaviour including dense water formation dwf in the complex coastal northern adriatic however all models have large temperature biases and lower deep stratification at the dense water collector sites indicating overall underrepresentation of the adriatic dwf consequently mixed layer depth in the southern adriatic is overestimated reaching the bottom during some years ocean model resolution and river forcing seem to play a second order role in defining the overall adriatic ionian thermohaline properties while inclusion of aerosol trend only slightly modified the bios reproduction keywords adriatic sea regional ocean modelling model validation thermohaline properties dense water formation adriatic ionian bimodal

atlantic through the 14 km wide strait of gibraltar soto navarro et al 2015 further it is especially challenging to reproduce the mediterranean winds even with high resolution mesoscale atmospheric models myers et al 1998 ruti et al 2008 herrmann et al 2011 davolio et al 2015 this particularly refers to the winds that are significantly modified by the coastal orography mistral tramontane bora drobinski et al 2001 chronis et al 2011 grisogono and belušić 2009 winds misrepresentation leads to misrepresentation of their effects to the ocean and thus to misrepresentation of a great number of ocean phenomena herrmann and somot 2008 béranger et al 2010 ličer et al 2016 as a consequence the mediterranean ocean modelling has a long tradition of constant improvement of its different segments on the long term basis the mediterranean models have mostly been tested for the western mediterranean only somot et al 2018 waldman et al 2016 ruti et al 2016 in this study we are assessing performance of regional ocean models in the adriatic sea over the long term time scale the adriatic basin fig 1 consists of a shallow northern shelf with depths up to 80 m middle adriatic depressions jabuka pit with maximum depth of 280 m and the 1230 m deep circular southern adriatic pit sap the basin is connected with the ionian sea through the 850 m deep otranto strait general adriatic circulation is cyclonic controlled by the topography and the bathymetry wind stress surface buoyancy fluxes river discharge and mass and energy exchanges through the strait of otranto orlić et al 1992 artegiani et al 1997a poulain and raicich 2001 zavatarelli et al 2002 it is a place where dense water formation dwf occurs during wintertime both through cooling of shelf waters in the northern adriatic resulting in the northern adriatic dense water naddw vilibić and supić 2005 and through the deep convection in the sap that results in the adriatic deep water adw buljan and zore armanda 1976 gačić et al 2002 bora wind driven cooling in the shallow northern adriatic is intense enough to induce a substantial surface heat loss up to a maximum of 2000 w m2 grisogono and belušić 2009 janeković et al 2014 davolio et al 2015 resulting in ocean convection process that rapidly reaches the very bottom resulting naddw spreads over the entire northern adriatic malanotte rizzoli 1977 bergamasco et al 1999 freshwater load in this area raicich 1996 especially during late autumn and early winter is also crucial in defining the naddw characteristics franco and michelato 1992 as these freshwaters especially the ones coming from po river spread over a large part of the northern adriatic and therefore control the salinity content artegiani et al 1997a b supić et al 2004 newly formed naddw recognized as one of the densest mediterranean water mass vilibić and supić 2005 mihanović et al 2013 flows along the western adriatic coast in southward direction as a density current nof 1983 and in a short time less than a month accumulates in jabuka pit artegiani and salusti 1987 vilibić 2003 janeković et al 2014 a month later the naddw is transported towards the deep layers of the sap vilibić and šantić 2008 bensi et al 2013 querin et al 2013 carniel et al 2016 chiggiato et al 2016 the adw which is itself generated in the sap as a direct result of winter surface heat losses has a lower density than the naddw but an order of magnitude larger volume ovchinnikov et al 1985 gačić et al 2002 vilibić and orlić 2002 numerous studies reported interannual variability in the intensity of the deep convection process occurring in the sap mantziafou and lascaratos 2004 2008 oddo and guarnieri 2011 which in turn affects the adw density values and total volumes this variability is preconditioned by the presence of saltier water mass i e by the amount of warm and saline levantine intermediate water liw that enters the adriatic sea from the levantine basin zore armanda 1963 gačić et al 2010 dunić et al 2018 and together with wintertime cooling determine the rate of the dwf cardin and gačić 2003 after generation the adw exits the adriatic sea through the bottom layers of the otranto strait gačić et al 1996 reale et al 2016 and flows towards the deep layers of the ionian sea and eastern mediterranean sustaining the eastern mediterranean thermohaline circulation roether and schlitzer 1991 manca et al 2002 somot et al 2006 the adriatic thermohaline and biogeochemical properties are also characterized by substantial decadal variations buljan 1953 civitarese et al 2010 vilibić et al 2012 which are coherent with the circulation regimes in the northern ionian sea experimental studies using sea surface height ssh measurements gačić et al 2010 mihanović et al 2015 identified two different circulation regimes in the northern ionian cyclonic and anticyclonic first transition was documented between 1997 and 1998 when circulation switched from anticyclonic to cyclonic contrasting transition was observed in 2006 gačić et al 2010 with anticyclonic pattern persisting until 2011 gačić et al 2014 one of the main drivers of the observed variability is the internal dynamics of the adriatic ionian system as upper layer circulation reversal in the northern ionian is affected by the changes in geostrophic balance of the area due to different water mass advection borzelli et al 2009 gačić et al 2010 when the northern ionian sea experiences cyclonic circulation regime saline liw enters the adriatic sea and increases density of both the naddw and the adw gačić et al 2010 during the anticyclonic regime less saline western mediterranean waters enter the adriatic leading to a decrease in naddw and adw density spreading of the adw and the naddw with different characteristics into the northern ionian is hypothesized to change the vorticity through stretching or compressing of the water column at the perimeter of the gyre thus changing the circulation regimes it is suggested that described adriatic ionian feedback mechanism behaves as a bimodal oscillating system called the adriatic ionian bimodal oscillating system bios gačić et al 2010 the adriatic dwf dynamics and variability was investigated via both experimental studies buljan and zore armanda 1976 gačić et al 2002 bensi et al 2013 mihanović et al 2013 2015 and using numerical simulations explicitly designed to investigate these processes bergamasco et al 1999 beg paklar et al 2001 dobričić 2002 zavatarelli et al 2002 cushman roisin et al 2007 janeković et al 2010 2014 gunduz et al 2013 however these studies were carried out only for a short time scale and on the process level also neglecting the analyses of coupled runs there are a few studies that document dwf interannual variability mantziafou and lascaratos 2008 béranger et al 2010 oddo and guarnieri 2011 revealing its high temporal and spatial variability in those studies importance of high resolution properly introduced topography and external forcing atmospheric and river discharges as well as model coupling strategies is suggested in order to properly simulate these physical processes that require a mesoscale approach their conclusions were however based only on the analysis of short term simulations the only study involving a multi decadal regional simulation performance analysis of the adriatic thermohaline properties and processes was recently conducted by dunić et al 2018 the focus of that study was the dwf and the bios reproduction as well as their interannual and decadal variability using nemo med8 simulations 50 year run in order to quantify long term changes in oceanographic properties of the adriatic ionian thermohaline circulation and its variability on a longer time scales and to test the performance of climate models with different setup in the basin we used seven different regional hindcast simulations based on various configurations of nemo mediterranean versions covering era interim period 1980 2012 these simulations are produced within the framework of the med cordex initiative www medcordex eu we chose models with different settings to investigate impact of different factors vertical and horizontal resolution freshwater load surface heat fluxes air sea interaction and aerosol trend effect on interannual and decadal variability of the adriatic ionian thermohaline properties including the adriatic dwf and the bios we evaluated performance of models on the long term in situ data collected over the three northern adriatic transects the palagruža sill transect and at jabuka pit and south adriatic pit as well as on the altimetry remote observations section 2 presents data used for evaluation gives basic description of models and provides an assessment of rivers and wintertime net heat fluxes section 3 pictures overall performance of the models while verification on in situ data is presented in section 4 section 5 presents the model performances on reproduction of the dwf and the bios discussion and conclusions are provided in section 6 2 material and methods 2 1 regional ocean system models 2 1 1 models and models setup nemo med model is a numerical 3d ocean model adapted regionally for the reproduction of the mediterranean properties and processes e g beuvier et al 2010 herrmann et al 2010 somot et al 2018 it is based on the nemo nucleus for european modelling of the ocean free surface finite difference primitive equation numerical global ocean model madec 2008 the domain of the model covers the mediterranean sea and a small fraction of the atlantic used as a buffer zone imposed off the strait of gibraltar with 3d damping of temperature and salinity and 2d damping of sea level imposed exchange with the black sea is parameterized as a river point source that imposes the black sea evaporation precipitation runoff e p r freshwater budget to the aegean sea the model bathymetry is based on etopo 5 x5 database smith and sandwell 1997 vertical mixing is parameterized by the turbulent kinetic energy scheme blanke and delecluse 1993 by an enhanced vertical diffusion of 10 m² s for convective adjustment and by an interior background diffusivity of 10 m² s initial conditions are taken from the medar medatlas ii derived for the 1960s medar medatlas 2002 while spin up period and the ocean lateral conditions differ between simulations depending on the available computing resources and requirements at the time of models run execution using 7 nemo med simulations we analysed the reproduction of the long term adriatic thermohaline properties and processes the selected simulations differ in horizontal and vertical resolutions spatial and temporal resolution of the atmospheric forcing inclusion or not of the aerosol trend freshwater forcing coming from the rivers and the inclusion or not of the atmospheric coupling more details are listed in table 1 simulations are marked as follows med8f med8c1 c3 and med12f1 f3 where 8 and 12 stand for the overall horizontal resolution 1 8 vs 1 12 while f and c stand for the forced and coupled simulation respectively the med12f3 simulation has an additional nested eddy permitting model with higher horizontal resolution 1 36 in the adriatic ionian area all simulations are run for 1980 2012 period all med8 based and med12 based simulations have 43 and 75 unevenly spaced vertical z layers respectively med8f simulation is forced by arperav2 atmospheric forcing daily mean fields of momentum freshwater and heat fluxes with resolution of 50 km relaxation to the era 40 sea surface temperature sst herrmann et al 2010 while med12f1 f3 models are forced by aldera atmospheric forcing 3 h mean fields of momentum freshwater and heat fluxes with resolution of 12 km relaxation to the era interim sst hamon et al 2016 med12f3 differs from the med12f1 f2 in the initial conditions spin up duration sst relaxation term and in the inclusion of additional freshwater flux correction as for the river forcing freshwater fluxes are introduced at the river mouths as the surface boundary flux in the forced models taking the climatology from the rivdis database vörösmarty et al 1996 ludwig et al 2009 med8f contains 33 main river mouths in the mediterranean of which 8 are placed in the adriatic two of them in front of the river po and the rest are albanian rivers red dots in fig 1 in dunić et al 2018 freshwater fluxes in med12f1 and med12f3 come from the same 33 mediterranean rivers and the remaining discharge of the mediterranean is imposed as an averaged coastal runoff over all lateral grid points beuvier et al 2012 the difference in med12f2 simulation is the treatment of the adriatic sea instead of the previous 8 adriatic river mouths with additional coastal runoff we imposed a new river climatology with total of 44 adriatic river mouths and no additional coastal runoff as documented by vilibić et al 2016 seasonal signal in river discharges in med12f2 was taken from vilibić et al 2016 modulated in time with ludwig et al 2009 interannual variability fully coupled regional climate models med8c1 c3 include regional representation of the atmosphere aladin climate model radu et al 2008 land surface and hydrology isba model noilhan and mahfouf 1996 rivers trip model oki and sud 1998 and the ocean

climatology in the atmospheric models or forcing is included in all simulations with more recent climatology used in med8c2 c3 simulations med8c2 differs from med8c1 in the spin up period aerosol climatology and in additional spectral nudging applied to the atmospheric forcing in med8c1 med8c3 differs from med8c2 in the inclusion of the observed decreasing trend in the sulfate aerosol optical

assessment of the adriatic river forcing river discharges constitute a significant portion of the water mass budget in the adriatic sea affecting strongly ocean properties particularly in the shallow northern adriatic kourafalou 1999 vilibić et al 2016 thus an assessment of annual river discharges introduced to the models and their seasonal cycles was performed separately for the three adriatic regions fig 2 east eastern coastline of the adriatic denoted with yellow colour north northern part denoted with blue colour and west western coastline denoted with green colour in fig 1 annual river discharges in models range between 600 and 1560 m3 s in east 1479 and 2192 m3 s in north and 0 and 333 m3 s in west domain med8f has only six river mouths vjosa seman shkumbini erzen mat and drin in east two adige and po in north and zero river mouths in west in total eight rivers mouths in the adriatic sea in addition to these rivers med12f1 and med12f3 has included coastal runoff for further explanation see section 2 1 1 rivers introduced in med12f2 are based on the recent measurements for which we can consider to be most reliable vilibić et al 2016 and are totalling in 18 14 and 12 river mouths in east north and west respectively due to the lack of the data the discharge rates in med8f med12f1 and med12f3 after 2001 didn t include interannual variability instead the annual discharge rates were taken as a constant equal to the 2001 value however seasonal variability was still included in that period all models show similar interannual and seasonal variability in any given region east west or north but differ significantly between regions in the eastern adriatic east minimum discharge rates are found during summer while highest rates are present in autumn winter period however med8f with only eight river mouths in the basin is experiencing a substantially low adriatic discharge during all years coupled models show higher discharges in winter for about 600 m3 s and lower in summer almost zero compared to the new adriatic river climatology 500 m3 s used in med12f2 in the northern adriatic north the seasonal cycle is different experiencing minima in february and august september and maxima in spring and late autumn the spring peak largely driven by the snow melt raicich 1996 in med8f med12f1 and med12f3 is shifted from march april to may june compared to med12f2 but properly reproduced by the coupled models august december period as well as the autumn peak driven by the precipitation maximum raicich 1996 is underrepresented in all models compared to med12f2 up to 700 m3 s on average the northern adriatic annual discharge rates are highest in med12f2 and lowest in coupled models in the western adriatic west discharges are much lower compared to the other two regions med8f has zero discharge as no river mouths were introduced to the model there in this area med12f1 and med12f3 don t show seasonal cycle since coastal runoff used in the model has only interannual variability variety of river forcing options allow us to study influence of water discharge rates on the model performances 2 1 3 assessment of the wintertime atmospheric forcing wintertime heat losses are responsible for the adriatic dwf which in turn drives the thermohaline circulation in the adriatic ionian basin orlić et al 2006 somot et al 2006 heat fluxes are introduced in the med8f model through dynamically downscaled ecmwf era 40 reanalysis called arperav2 herrmann and somot 2008 herrmann et al 2010 that has 50 km of resolution over the 1961 2013 period the three med12f models are forced with 12 km aldera which is a regional downscaled era interim reanalysis hamon et al 2016 covering the period from 1979 2013 averaged november december january february ndjf net heat fluxes fig 3 over two dense water formation areas northern and southern adriatic denoted with red squares in fig 1 reveal their synchrony in interannual variability their average values are similar in all models over the southern adriatic with the lowest values found in med8f but differ in the northern adriatic where ndjf average heat losses are higher by about 20 30 for coupled models compared to the forced ones also the southern adriatic average heat losses are larger than in the northern adriatic during wintertime e g average med8c1 heat fluxes equal to 129 w m2 in the northern adriatic and 149 w m2 in the southern adriatic not shown amongst other larger difference between air temperature and sst is affecting larger wintertime heat losses in the deep southern adriatic during the coldest part of the year december february in contrast the shallow northern adriatic is rapidly cooled during autumn when heat losses are not at their maximum average ndjf net heat fluxes over the whole adriatic sea for the analysed period equal to 161 155 155 154 146 146 and 130 w m2 for the med8f med8c1 med8c2 med8c3 med12f1 med12f2 and med12f3 respectively the flux rates are following the literature where old climatology may 1982 is estimating average ndjf net heat losses over the whole adriatic basin to be 173 w m2 artegiani et al 1997a recent estimates based on era 40 reanalysis data set reduced these heat losses by 10 20 cardin and gačić 2003 with yearly adriatic averaged ndjf flux values between 133 and 165 w m2 depending on the used methodology yet a comparison of different heat flux estimations comes with limitations as various data sets spatial coverage methodologies and time periods are represented in the literature however we conclude that all the forcing datasets used in this study lie in the range of already published estimates with arpera having stronger and aldera milder forcing 2 2 observational data in situ temperature and salinity collected at 22 stations have been used for evaluation of ocean simulations most of the stations 15 of them are located in the northern adriatic spanning over three transects na nb nc fig 1 the data have been collected monthly at standard oceanographic depths 0 5 10 20 m and bottom during 1980 2012 there were 144 507 and 435 cruises over na nb and nc transects respectively temperature was measured using reversing thermometers and salinity was determined using mohr and knudsen s method supić et al 2012 in the middle and southern adriatic 5 stations are located along the palagruža sill ps transect and two individual stations within the two adriatic depressions sap station d1200 and jabuka pit station jp at the ps transect data were measured with quasi monthly resolution at the northernmost stations p1 and p2 and seasonally at stations p3 p5 during the given time period 237 241 93 86 and 91 samplings were taken at stations p1 to p5 respectively at station jp the data were collected mostly on a seasonal basis till 1990 followed by occasional surveying only 93 profiles at station d1200 the data were sampled quasi uniformly over all seasons throughout the common period 86 profiles at the ps transect and stations jp and d1200 temperature was determined using reversing thermometers until 1998 while salinity was determined with rs 10 induction salinometers afterwards idroanut 36 and seabird 25 ctd probes were in use samplings were performed at standard oceanographic depths 0 10 20 30 50 75 100 150 200 300 400 500 600 800 1000 m and bottom whenever a change in methodology occurred instruments were intercalibrated potential density anomalies pdas with a reference pressure of zero were estimated using teos 10 algorithms the data have already been statistically quality checked and used in a number of studies vilibić 2003 vilibić et al 2011 2012 2013 supić et al 2012 mihanović et al 2015 dunić et al 2018 even though all the series started before 1980 this study focuses on the common period of all models 1980 2012 for the bios related analysis we used daily absolute dynamic topography adt multimission gridded data that cover the time period from 1993 2012 this data was taken from the aviso web site http www aviso altimetry fr regional smdt med 2014 in the duacs 2014 v15 0 3 models overall performance spatial distribution of the 1980 2012 averaged bottom potential temperatures salinities and pdas fig 4 reveal a similarity in their spatial patterns but with an offset between mean values compared to other models med8f has highest bottom temperatures average of 14 7 c and highest salinities average of 38 5 resulting in high densities over the entire domain average of 28 7 kg m3 the three coupled models are rather similar with averaged bottom temperatures between 13 9 c and 14 2 c salinity averages between 38 2 and 38 3 and pda averages of about 28 7 kg m3 the three forced models of higher resolution med12f1 f3 reproduce lower bottom temperatures average of 14 5 c compared to med8f when it comes to salinity two forced models med12f1 f2 reproduce slightly higher bottom salinities than coupled models average of 38 3 whereas med12f3 reproduces lowest bottom salinities of all models average of 38 1 therefore having lower bottom pda 28 5 kg m3 compared to med12f1 f2 models about 28 6 kg m3 temperature salinity and density average spatial distributions do not reveal the northern adriatic as a dwf site in fact bottom northern adriatic waters are simulated to have the lowest densities of the entire adriatic waters this is not unrealistic as dense waters generated in the northern adriatic are advected towards the middle and southern adriatic within a few tens of days after generation thus having a very short residence time in the north mihanović et al 2013 successfulness of dwf reproduction in the northern adriatic will be checked later by focusing on the analysis of thermohaline properties simulated during common dwf periods moving to the south a pool of cold and dense waters can be found at the bottom of jabuka pit this pool is particularly pronounced in coupled model runs med8c1 3 with average temperatures of 12 5 c and densities of 29 2 kg m3 the same applies to the bottom layers of the southern adriatic pit although waters which are modelled to reside there have higher temperatures and salinities in average 1 5 c and 0 2 higher and lower densities in average 0 3 kg m3 lower than the jabuka pit waters the coastal north eastern waters are resolved only with higher resolution med12f models depths in this area are higher than at the open northern adriatic waters with 1 2 c lower temperatures than in the adjacent open adriatic waters it should be noted that this area has only recently been recognized as the secondary northern adriatic dense water formation site mihanović et al 2013 due to the strong heat losses driven by severe bora reaching up to 2000 w m2 during extreme bora wind events janeković et al 2014 contrary to the expectations med12f3 simulation has very low pda values at the bottom of this area 28 3 kg m3 mostly due to unrealistically low salinities 37 3 caused by the larger freshwater load compared to other models oppositely and in agreement with the recent observations med12f1 and med12f2 classify this deep coastal region as an area where the adriatic dense waters are generated if we compare the model runs which differ in only one parameter we can conclude i inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c3 vs non inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c2 does not create any significant changes of bottom thermohaline properties and ii inclusion of the new river climatology in med12f2 vs old river climatology in med12f1 only slightly increases salinities in the eastern coastal area resulting in higher pda next we look at seasonal temperature salinity and pda cycles at several depths over the entire domain of the adriatic sea fig 5 the shape of the seasonal cycles is consistent between the models but there is an offset between mean values expectedly temperature seasonal cycle fig 5a peaks in august at surface layers and in december at bottom layers maximum temperatures in the intermediate layer are reached in november december marking this as the time when combination of vertical mixing and inflow of the liw to the adriatic strongly influences the temperature increase throughout the water column coupled models exhibit lower temperatures of about 0 5 1 0 c than the forced ones due to the overestimated surface shortwave and latent heat losses sevault et al 2014 this difference is most pronounced during february april and reduced during late autumn and early winter october december temperature vertical changes are more pronounced in coupled models than in forced ones salinity seasonal distribution among different models is again of similar shape but with an offset between mean values fig 5b model with highest salinity throughout the water column is med8f average salinity changes between 37 9 at surface and 38 7 at 100 m where an inflow of saline liw is occurring and model with consistently low salinity is med12f3 average salinity at surface and at 100 m is about 37 5 as for other models the offset varies vertically coupled models have i higher salinities averages of 37 8 37 9 than med12f1 2 models averages of 37 6 37 8 at the surface ii significantly lower salinities at 100 m depths averages of 38 5 38 6 than med12f1 2 models averages of 38 7 and iii similar salinities as med12f1 2 models in the bottom layer vertical salinity gradients are somewhat less pronounced in coupled models than in forced models for example maximum salinity changes between 38 1 at the surface and 38 6 at the liw intrusion depth in med8c2 whereas it changes between 37 9 at the surface and 38 7 at the liw intrusion depth in med12f2 model surface salinity fig 5b has a substantial seasonal cycle with minimum in may june lagging for one month after the river discharge peak which normally occurs in april may raicich 1996 vilibić et al 2016 these less saline waters are then spread over the thermally driven stratified waters particularly over the northern adriatic franco and michelato 1992 supić et al 2004 at 100 m salinity increases from february march to september october this corresponds to a known period in which a few months after the adriatic dwf events the adriatic thermohaline circulation strengthens thus increasing advection of saline waters from the northern ionian sea orlić et al 2006 the salinity difference between models is larger than its seasonal cycle the near bottom salinity generally follows seasonality of intermediate waters keeping also the spread of average values between the models for about 0 4 between med8f and med12f3 over the water column simulated pdas are largest in three coupled models medc1 c3 and in med8f model average of about 28 4 kg m3 forced models generally reproduce waters with lower densities with the lowest values found in the fresh med12f3 model average pda changes from 28 1 kg m3 in med12f3 to 28 3 kg m3 in med12f1 fig 5c february march maximum bottom pdas relevant for the dwf range from 28 9 kg m3 in med12f3 to 29 2 kg m3 in med8f and coupled models as for seasonal changes the pda cycle fig 5c generally follows temperature cycle even in intermediate layers influenced by the liw where salinity changes oppose the temperature changes the largest pda values in the intermediate layer are reached in march adjoining temperature minimum as deep convection surpasses these depths in the most parts of the adriatic this also applies to the deep layers as the pda is driven by dense water generation that spreads rapidly in bottom layers after its generation during winter particularly in the northern adriatic although the seasonality in the pda is dominantly driven by temperature the overall pda differences between models are driven by both salinity and temperature when comparing only the model sets which differ in two parameters we conclude i inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c3 vs non inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c2 created minor opposing changes in temperature and salinity distribution resulting in almost identical density distributions ii inclusion of the new river climatology in med12f2 vs old river climatology in med12f1 slightly lowered surface salinity and slightly increased intermediate and bottom salinities resulting in almost negligible differences of averaged pdas between these two models plots of interannual distribution of salinity along the 40on transect crossing eastern side between 19 1 19 9oe of the otranto strait fig 6 a are used to discover how different models reproduce advection of the saline liw to the adriatic med8f and med12f3 have consistently highest and lowest salinities of all models average over the eastern side of the otranto strait of 38 9 kg m3 and 38 6 kg m3 respectively coupled models in particular med8c2 and med8c3 in general have higher salinities than forced models except med8f most models simulate periods with higher inflow of saline waters over most of the water column i in med8f model there are two prolonged periods with increased salinities over most of the water column during 1984 1993 and during 2002 2012 ii in coupled models inflow of highly saline water is intensified during 1996 2000 and during 2002 2012 iii in med12f1 and med12f2 similar inflow over the entire water column is intensified only during 2005 2008 being in good agreement with oddo and guarnieri 2011 who ascribed it to the production of saline water masses in the aegean sea and their effect on the liw pathways and iv no period with inflow of saline waters over the entire water column is reproduced by med12f3 simulation the liw inflow is occurring at greater depths in med8 models mostly between 200 and 600 m with s 38 7 than in med12 models mostly between 50 and 400 m with s 38 8 except med12f3 where liw inflow to the adriatic is very weak and above 200 m the observations and previous numerical simulations document the core of liw inflow at depths between 150 and 400 m gačić et al 1996 malanotte rizzoli et al 1997 kršinić and grbec 2002 manca et al 2002 and between 150 600 m oddo and guarnieri 2011 gunduz et al 2013 mantziafou and lascaratos 2004 respectively liw inflow is very weak in med12f3 model yet a broad salinity maxima are found in the deep layers of med12f3 model below 700 m these maxima were not found in other simulations hovmoller salinity diagrams for the deepest section of the palagruža sill station ps3 are shown in fig 6b palagruža sill is a key area for the adriatic water mass exchange and for the liw advection towards the middle and the northern adriatic buljan and zore armanda 1976 martin et al 2009 very strong interannual salinity variability is simulated to occur at this location as expected model with the highest simulated salinities is med8f averaged value of 38 7 and with the lowest is med12f3 averaged value of 38 4 salinities of forced models med12f1 f2 are higher average of 38 6 than salinities of coupled models averages of 38 4 38 5 similarly to the otranto most models show periods characterized by the presence of very saline waters i in med8f model these periods are again very long saline waters are present over palagruža sill during 1984 1992 and during 2002 2012 ii in coupled models saline waters are present during 1984 1992 1994 and during 2000 2006 and iii in med12f1 and med12f2 saline waters are present during 1984 1994 and during 2000 2008 although periods with slightly increased salinities are reproduced no period with the liw inflow over entire water column is reproduced by med12f3 model in the upper 150 m simulated temporal salinity changes at the palagruža sill are matching the ones simulated over the otranto strait this implies that the changes found at the palagruža sill transect are mostly driven by the water mass exchange between the adriatic and the ionian to better understand the behaviour of presented models regarding the liw intrusions at the otranto strait particularly of med12f3 and its high negative salinity bias that propagates throughout the entire adriatic sea we examined the mean vertical salinity distribution at the otranto strait transect crossing at 40on fig 7 models with lower horizontal and vertical resolution med8f med8c1 c3 are simulating the liw core at greater depths 300 350 m than med12 models med12f1 f3 200 250 m also the liw inflow is stretched to higher depths in the med8 models up to 800 m all models peak in salinity and liw inflow along the eastern side of the transect as found in observations while the outflow of the adw is present at the bottom and western slope of the transect the only exception is med12f3 which has the salinity maximum at the bottom of the transect and a very weak liw inflow and outflow found on the western and eastern parts of the transect respectively in surface to intermediate layers not shown also no adw outflow is present at the bottom of the transect altogether much weaker cross transect currents are reproduced by med12f3 than by other models not shown as med12f3 salinity distribution in the sap is similar not shown with salinity maxima found near the bottom 600 m it seems that the inflowing liw was denser than the residing waters in the sap at the beginning of the simulation due to overfreshening of the adriatic waters leading to vertical instabilities and liw sinking to the bottom of the sap this in turn i restricted the dwf to the upper layers and reduced the mixed layer depth mld see section 5 1 2 ii reduced the adw density characterizing it with much lower salinities as not preconditioned by the liw that sunk to the bottom and iii induced a very weak adw outflow at the otranto strait transect altogether a substantial deviation in reproduction of the adriatic ionian circulation is performed by med12f3 influencing as well the bios regimes in the northern ionian sea see section 5 2 when comparing the model runs which differ in only one parameter both for otranto strait fig 6a and palagruža sill fig 6b neither i inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c3 vs non inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c2 nor ii inclusion of the new river climatology in med12f2 vs old river climatology in med12f1 significantly changed the salinity distribution 4 model validation on observations 4 1 northern adriatic temperature and salinity data coming out of seven regional ocean simulations were evaluated with the available in situ data collected at three northern adriatic transects na nb nc representing northern middle and eastern parts of the area the stations are enumerated following w e direction for the transects na and nb and following n s direction for the nc transect fig 1 modelled temperature and salinity coming from the nearest grid points have been used for comparison to the observations vertically averaged model to observation temperature salinity and pda biases for all three northern transects are shown in fig 8 in general temperature is overestimated by all models most by med8f with averaged bias of 1 1 c and least by med8c1 with averaged bias of 0 5 c temperature overestimation is more pronounced near the western coast left parts of na and nb transects and the northernmost part transect na and less pronounced along the easterly placed nc transect the strong positive temperature bias is driven by higher subsurface and bottom temperatures which is a result of deeper than observed modelled seasonal thermocline particularly in med8 models in which it almost reached the bottom at the shallowest northern and western parts not shown the improper thermocline reproduction is presumably the result of insufficient vertical resolution of z models over wide northern adriatic shelf where med8 and med12 models have only 5 6 and 14 16 layers respectively coupling strategies are reducing the strength of local vertical mixing which was found higher in forced models except for med12f3 by reducing the heat losses and wind effects to the sea surface pullen et al 2007 ličer et al 2016 for that reason averaged mld over the adriatic sea in coupled models is lower than in the forced ones 27 m vs 31 m regarding salinity forced models exhibit negative biases in most of the northern adriatic with positive biases present only in the easternmost part nc transect the exception is med12f3 model which as expected for being overly fresh has negative salinity biases at all stations by contrast the coupled models are characterized by positive salinity biases at all stations except those in the northernmost part stations na1 na2 and partially nc1 positive biases are far largest at nb1 station which is a station closest to the po river delta implying that the po river discharge is not well introduced to the coupled models as seen in fig 2 as well as a consequence of both positive temperature and negative salinity biases the pda is strongly underestimated by forced models particularly in the northern and middle parts of the northern adriatic with the pdas bias reaching more than 0 6 kg m3 at some stations the only parts where forced models experience lower negative or slightly positive pda biases are at stations in the southern part of the nc transect stations nc3 nc5 following positive salinity biases coupled models exhibit different pda bias properties as corresponding salinity and temperature biases have same signs and thus opposite influence at the most of the northern adriatic in its southern and eastern parts nb transect and southern part of the nc transect pda biases in coupled models are slightly positive 0 1 0 2 kg m3 while they are negative at remaining points largest at the na1 station about 0 4 kg m3 when comparing the model runs which differ in one parameter we conclude that both i inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c3 vs non inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c2 and ii inclusion of the new river climatology in med12f2 vs old river climatology in med12f1 produce only minor changes in average thermohaline properties of the northern adriatic 4 2 middle and south adriatic multi model evaluation in the middle and southern parts of the adriatic was performed on in situ data measured along the palagruža sill transect stations ps1 ps5 enumerated from n to s fig 1 and at the jabuka pit jp and sap d1200 stations at the palagruža sill transect temperature bias reveals a distinction between forced and coupled models fig 9 a the coupled models have a negative bias at the surface up to 1 3 c which slightly decreases in the intermediate layer up to 0 8 c where the liw is advected from the southeast negative temperature bias further decreases towards the bottom where it stays between 0 and 0 4 c except at the station ps4 by contrast forced models have a positive and a negative surface temperature bias near the northern and southern parts of the transect respectively with increasing positive bias in intermediate 50 m and bottom layers where it surpasses 0 8 c that refers particularly to the med8f model as for salinity fig 9b throughout the whole water column most positive salinity biases are estimated for med8f model averaged values of 0 3 0 1 and 0 2 for the surface intermediate and bottom layer respectively and most negative for med12f3 model average values of 0 15 0 18 and 0 18 for the surface intermediate and bottom layer respectively for coupled models negative salinity biases are considerable and present throughout the water column at most of the stations with higher absolute values in intermediate and bottom layers up to 0 3 implying that liw reproduced by the coupled models is not saline enough on the other hand salinity biases found in forced models especially in med12f1 f2 in particular in the intermediate and bottom layers are of smaller absolute values up to 0 1 in med12f1 and f2 implying that liw characteristics are reproduced better by the forced models summing temperature and salinity effects pda biases are positive at the surface switching to negative in the intermediate and bottom layers in all models except med12f3 where pda biases are negative throughout the entire water column at almost all transect stations fig 9c the highest bottom pda underestimation over 0 2 kg m3 is expectedly found in med12f3 model primarily as a result of an underestimated salinity more than 0 2 aside for this model other models have a weak med8f up to 0 07 kg m3 or moderate e g med12f1 and med12f2 up to 0 15 kg m3 negative bias in deep layers that particularly refers to the bottom of the ps3 and ps5 stations where the dense waters originating from the northern adriatic are crossing the sill predominantly in spring and summer vilibić et al 2004 marini et al 2016 indicating that their pdas are underestimated by both forced and coupled models temperature biases found in jabuka pit a collector of dense waters artegiani et al 1997a vilibić et al 2004 are particularly pronounced in its near bottom layers fig 10 a left panel these layers are deeper than the palagruža sill and therefore are not directly influenced by the advection of incoming intermediate liw waters the positive temperature bias at 250 m ranges between 1 1 c and 1 2 c for coupled models to 1 5 1 8 c for forced models implying that all models either fail to reproduce accumulation of dense naddw at the bottom of the jabuka pit or that they reproduce insufficiently cold naddw at the intermediate layer where the liw advection normally occurs temperature biases are lower with negative biases reproduced by coupled models and zero or positive biases reproduced by forced models again implying that liw intrusions and characteristics are reproduced better by forced than by coupled models yet all models follow the same shape of vertical profiles of the temperature bias but with an offset between mean values not largely changing in rate up to 100 m and then strongly increasing towards the bottom similarly the shape of salinity biases fig 10b left panel differs only in an offset between models that is preserved through the water column a concave bulge particularly pronounced in coupled models and med12f3 may be found in intermediate layers 50 150 m revealing a salinity underestimation of the liw by these models together with a large negative temperature bias it indicates that coupled models and med12f3 do not properly represent either the advection of liw towards the middle adriatic or that liw source characteristics were not properly reproduced or were changed over its pathway to the adriatic the pda bias fig 10c left panel is mostly driven by the temperature effect being highest in the near bottom layers in the med12f3 model 0 4 kg m3 and lowest in forced models 0 2 0 3 kg m3 in intermediate layers the pda bias is much lower as the effects of temperature and salinity to density are contrasting for coupled models and med12f3 while temperature and salinity biases are rather low for forced models the d1200 station is characterized by negative temperature biases at the thermocline depth 20 30 m up to 1 8 c fig 10a right panel simulated by all models then the biases become less negative or slightly positive depending on the model toward the middle layers up to 50 m resulting in overestimated 0 2 0 3 c temperatures in forced models except med12f3 and largely underestimated temperatures 0 4 to 0 6 c by coupled models biases become more positive or less negative towards the bottom of the pit with smallest absolute biases simulated for med8c2 and med8c3 models 0 1 c and highest for med8f 0 5 c all four forced models show positive temperature biases at the bottom of d1200 implying that dense waters which are coming to the pit from the northern adriatic through sinking along its perimeter carniel et al 2016 chiggiato et al 2016 are of lower volumes or higher temperatures than observed the most negative salinity bias up to 0 2 fig 10b right panel is found between 100 and 500 m where liw advection has its maximum vilibić and orlić 2001 this is particularly pronounced in med8c1 and med12f3 models lowest salinity biases at the liw inflow depth are obtained with med12f1 f2 forced models in all models salinity bias becomes less negative or more positive toward the bottom similarly to the temperature bias the pda biases fig 10c right panel mostly originate from the temperature biases and are thus substantially positive in the surface layer and becoming negative at the bottom of the pit 1000 1200 m the 800 1200 m pda bias difference is around 0 04 kg m3 for all models but med12f3 for which is around 0 07 kg m3 when comparing the model sets which differ in one parameter we conclude that at all three studied locations jabuka pit palagruža sill transect and d1200 i inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c3 vs non inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c2 and ii inclusion of the new river climatology in med12f2 vs old river climatology in med12f1 produced only minor changes to the average thermohaline properties in the middle and south adriatic 5 model validation of processes 5 1 adriatic dense water formation 5 1 1 northern adriatic dense waters are dominantly generated in the northern adriatic during late winter mostly in february franco and michelato 1992 artegiani et al 1997a vilibić and supić 2005 kuzmić et al 2006 when waters with lowest temperatures are found there supić et al 2004 therefore biases for temperature salinity and pda collected for february have been used as a proxy for successfulness of dwf reproduction separately at the surface and at the bottom fig 11 if comparing fig 11 to fig 8 in which we have shown northern adriatic biases averaged over the entire period we can notice the same behaviour of biases of all forced models but opposite behaviour of biases of coupled models in february coupled models reproduce colder biases up to 1 1 c fig 10a and only slightly fresher biases up to 0 14 water masses with particularly low in absolute value biases of salinity and pda at bottom layers fig 11b and c this implies that dwf in the northern adriatic is reproduced better with coupled models than with the forced ones coupled models work especially well over the western part of transects nb1 nb3 where both temperature and salinity biases and consequently pda biases are of lowest absolute values this is particularly rewarding as dense waters are known to be dominantly generated in the central and western section of the northern adriatic shelf within a cyclonic eddy driven largely by the bora wind bergamasco et al 1999 beg paklar et al 2001 upon generation these waters leave northern adriatic area along the western adriatic coast vilibić et al 2004 mihanović et al 2013 thus model validation along the western part of the northern adriatic is more relevant for dwf validation contrary forced models reproduce february temperature and salinity biases up to 1 7 c and 0 6 fig 11a and b comparable to temperature and salinity biases estimated for the entire year fig 8a and b this strongly implies that northern adriatic dwf is not so well reproduced by the forced models this is somewhat surprising especially for med12 models which are forced by the atmospheric fields of higher resolution 12 km 3 hourly than are atmospheric fields used for forcing or coupling of med8 models 50 km daily looking a bit more in detail into salinity biases we notice that salinity february biases of forced models med12f1 f2 fig 11b exhibit quite high negative surface biases in the western part of the northern adriatic up to 2 2 which is an indicator of much higher spreading of river waters primarily of po river introduced in all models from the shoreline these low salinity waters spread over the dwf site thus presumably weakening or preventing dwf in that part of the northern adriatic in med12f1 f2 by contrast surface salinity bias in coupled models is positive 0 3 0 5 along the central and western northern adriatic implying that the low salinity coastal current is suppressed more to the shoreline following the observations kourafalou 1999 beg paklar et al 2001 better reproduction of dense water by the coupled models can be perceived from q q plots in which all northern adriatic measurements are compared to the modelled values fig 12 for all models systematic offsets between measured and modelled temperature are present through the data however forced models have larger errors both at intermediate and at higher tails of temperature distributions fig 12a this particularly applies to the lowest february temperatures associated with high heat losses and strong dwf where an overestimation in temperature by forced models is rather strong up to 1 2 c coupled models perform best in the range 9 0 11 0 c and around 12 0 c while larger temperature underestimations are present at low temperatures associated with the dwf salinity is fairly reproduced by all models at the upper tail of the distribution where salinities are higher than 38 0 with the best reproduction achieved by the coupled models these models keep fair reproduction of the february lower salinities as well from 37 0 to 38 0 whereas forced models are underestimating them as for the lowest salinity values 37 0 present mostly in the po influenced westernmost part of the northern adriatic coupled models strongly overestimate these values while forced models slightly underestimate them coupled models are successfully reproducing highest pdas values above 28 2 kg m3 fig 12c but overestimating lower pdas mostly due to the salinity overestimation salinity also strongly affects the pda bias of forced models for values below 28 8 kg m3 with the pda of forced models underestimated for most values exception is med8f model in which pda of the densest waters is overestimated spatial characteristics and the dynamics of modelled dwf might be assessed from the bottom pda distribution during a period with a documented strong dwf like february 2012 during this period record breaking densities were measured in the northern adriatic mihanović et al 2013 raicich et al 2013 benetazzo et al 2014 janeković et al 2014 ličer et al 2016 the average bottom pda distribution obtained for february 2012 by all models is compared to the pda distribution fig 13 extracted from a high resolution ocean modelling system 2 km roms ocean model driven by an 8 km atmospheric aladin forcing by a new river climatology and by daily fields of adriatic forecasting system afs areg model applied at the open boundary at the otranto strait janeković et al 2014 this model run was extensively validated on the available measurements and shown to reproduce temporal and spatial characteristics of all observed dwf phases a dry preconditioning with low precipitation and river discharges during preceding year mihanović et al 2013 the dwf occurring in the cyclone anticyclone bipole over the whole water column zore armanda and gačić 1987 beg paklar et al 2001 kuzmić et al 2006 and spreading of dense water mass along the western coastline towards jabuka pit and the sap vilibić and mihanović 2013 mihanović et al 2013 marini et al 2016 when compared to the roms model the pda values are underestimated in most of the domain by all models except med8f fig 13 where they reach their maximum in the northernmost and shallowest part of the shelf exactly where the record breaking densities were measured mihanović et al 2013 this does not however instantly imply that med8f model is optimal for reproduction of dwf processes the fact is that this model is overly saline both due to the water mass characteristics entering the adriatic through otranto fig 6a and dunić et al 2018 and to low river discharges fig 2 with just two northern adriatic river mouths introduced to this model on the other hand med12f1 and med12f2 have much less saline waters entering the adriatic through otranto strait and better river climatology particularly the med12f2 in which a combination of river discharges measured during the last decade and databases based on ludwig et al 2009 were used in spite of better salinity content med12f1 f2 were not able to properly reproduce dwf in the open northern adriatic even though a slight improvement is visible in the med12f2 model taking form of bottom waters with higher densities when compared to med12f1 as implied during discussion related to fig 11 this might be due to improper introduction of the po river outflow also it should be noted that river discharges were imposed as constant after 2001 in all forced models except med12f2 both med12f1 and med12f2 models were able to reproduce secondary pda maximum present in the eastern coastal area quite well the last forced model med12f3 properly reproduces spatial distribution with maximum pda in the northernmost part of the shelf but with a distinct offset compared to roms model we should keep in mind that this model has far lowest e p r budget and thus much lower overall salinities for the same reason no dwf was found in the eastern coastal area of med12f3 model as the coastal runoff is contributing to the largest freshwater load of all models in this area compared to med12f2 averaged discharge rates in med12f3 are for 270 kg m3 higher also the med8 model domains do not cover the coastal eastern adriatic due to their coarser resolution and thus cannot reproduce dwf in this area this is a significant shortcoming since it has been shown that dense waters generated at this location contributed up to about 40 to the total production of dense waters in 2012 janeković et al 2014 conclusively a smaller area in which dwf is occurring presumably results in additional underestimation of northern adriatic dwf in med8 models as for coupled models although they are reproducing denser waters than med12f1 f2 in the open northern adriatic dwf maximum is not at a proper position or of a proper value maximum pda and therefore the maximum dwf site in coupled models is placed off the kvarner bay at locations where the strongest bora wind jet is present so called senj jet janeković et al 2014 as the northern adriatic dwf is primarily driven by strong heat losses beg paklar et al 2001 mihanović et al 2013 some model differences may be associated with spatial distribution of heat losses fig 14 models with coarser resolution of their atmospheric forcing med8 exhibit a broad maximum in february 2012 spanning off the eastern coastal area with absolute values of this maximum higher than absolute values of heat losses modelled by roms model but with no real signature of the gulf of trieste jet or senj jet the forced models driven by aldera high resolution forcing med12f show more realistic spatial details and in particular the signature of the three identified jets however in med12 models the northern heat loss maximum the senj jet is weaker than the southern one the sukošan jet that is contrasting the high resolution model used by janeković et al 2014 which reproduced twice larger heat losses within the senj jet than within the sukošan jet also heat losses within the bora banner originating in the gulf of trieste in which bora blows over the shallowest part of the northern adriatic influencing the generation of the densest waters in 2012 mihanović et al 2013 raicich et al 2013 janeković et al 2014 are not reproduced to be of sufficient strength by med12 models conclusively coupled models are better reproducing the dense water distribution and pda values at open northern adriatic than forced models due to overall larger heat losses and higher salinities thus to properly reproduce northern adriatic dwf we need to use both coupled models and atmospheric models of higher resolutions with an emphasis on the latter which are able to simulate spatial distribution of heat losses more realistically in this area according to bias analysis figs 11 and 12 increasing heat losses is slightly more important than increasing spatial resolution as models with higher heat losses med8c1 c3 reproduce dwf better than models with higher resolution med12f1 f2 much like for discussion of reproduction of general yearly thermohaline properties of the adriatic it seems that neither i inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c3 vs non inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c2 nor ii inclusion of the new river climatology in med12f2 vs old river climatology in med12f1 influenced northern adriatic dwf however an extension of the domain to the kvarner bay by med12 models of which med12f2 is performing somewhat better surely has an effect on northern adriatic dwf rates 5 1 2 southern adriatic the sap is a place where adw is generated through open convection processes in february and early march e g gačić et al 2002 one way to measure the strength of the open convection process is the mld which has been estimated for all models using the turbocline criterion somot et al 2006 unfortunately there are no in situ stations from which reliable long term mld estimations might be obtained for the area as d1200 is positioned at the perimeter of the deep convection area dunić et al 2018 in addition a number of cross adriatic temperature and salinity measurements were carried out since the 1970 s vilibić and orlić 2001 indicating that the mld did not surpass 900 m while atmosphere ocean buoy has been operational in the southern part of the pit only during the last decade bozzano et al 2013 thus the modelled mld will be compared to the existing literature and mld estimates coming from certain field campaigns fig 15 shows interannual variability of spatial and temporal maximum mld at the sap that was determined from the daily modelled mld values for all models maximum values are reached in february the mean maximum yearly mlds over the whole period 1980 2012 are 844 m 673 m 641 m 636 m 738 m 733 m and 477 m for med8f med8c1 med8c2 med8c3 med12f1 med12f2 and med12f3 respectively thus med8f has generally the largest mld while med12f3 has the lowest as for other models the mld is modelled to be higher in coupled models for years associated with very strong heat losses fig 3 in 1984 coupled models gave maximum mld of 1100 m and med12f1 f2 forced models gave maximum of 800 950 m in 1993 coupled models gave maximum mld of 1200 m and med12f1 and med12f2 models gave maximum of 1100 m furthermore the range of values is considerably different between coupled and med12f1 f2 models e g the mld varies between 200 and 1200 m in med8c2 and between 500 and 1100 m in med12f1 vilibić and orlić 2001 documented the mld reaching 800 m in 1987 manca and bregant 1998 displayed the mld reaching 600 m in 1996 gačić et al 2002 estimated mld depth at 900 m 35 m low convective year and 300 m in 1992 1997 and 1998 respectively which is all in good agreement with the coupled models aside for 1998 vilibić and šantić 2008 documented the mld depth in 2006 to about 650 m while mihanović et al 2013 investigated argo profiling float data in the winter of 2012 and estimated the mld at around 500 m the latter being in agreement with med12f3 by contrast the absence of the open convection has not been frequently investigated with recent winter of 2015 for which the maximum mld has been estimated to 250 300 m lučić et al 2017 and abovementioned winter of 1998 for which mld has been estimated to 35 m gačić et al 2002 in spite of the fact that observations might underestimate the real value due to undersampling i e lack of sampling at periods of intense water formation it still appears that mixing is much stronger in models than in reality aside for med12f3 model for which it was simulated to be weaker one potential reason for mld overestimation during severe winters by the presented models might be an underestimation of the northern adriatic dwf detected by the d1200 biases fig 9 as these waters are found to fill the near bottom layers below 800 m in the sap bensi et al 2013 querin et al 2013 chiggiato et al 2016 langone et al 2016 increasing the vertical stability of deep layers and preventing deep convection reaching the bottom consequently the modelled stability of deep waters 800 1200 m is lowered allowing for the surface forcing to penetrate much higher in depth in the models the next culprit might be liw misreproduction in intermediate layers which in reality changes the stability of the waters hit by vertical mixing during severe wintertime outbreaks and open ocean convection and which are misrepresented in studied climate models in particular in coupled ones too strong heat losses might also be a reason for enhanced mixing as well as the problem with model parametrisation and bathymetry representation which might cause too strong vertical mixing in particular over steep areas like the sap dutour sikirić et al 2009 all simulations show strong interannual and decadal dwf variability fig 15 especially prominent in the coupled models the correlation factors between averaged ndjf net heat fluxes estimated for the southern adriatic fig 3 and the yearly maximum mld are around 0 8 for all models significant at the 99 level this denotes the strong effect of the atmospheric forcing in shaping the dwf on an interannual scale which is in agreement with gulf of lions studies l hévéder et al 2013 somot et al 2018 after 1993 a decade with weaker convective activity occurred supported by lower ndjf net heat fluxes yet the decadal variability is also affected by the bios which may affect dwf preconditioning once generated the adw flows to the bottom of the otranto strait towards the deep eastern mediterranean roether and schlitzer 1991 robinson et al 2001 to estimate adw outflow cumulative southward annual transports over the 40 latitude stretching across the otranto strait above a certain pda threshold have been estimated fig 16 as shown before all models differ in their mean salinity values that affect the pdas inside the adriatic for that reason we determined the pda threshold for each model separately as the 95 percentile of all monthly mean pda values found below 100 m at otranto strait which refers to the seasonal pycnocline depth buljan and zore armanda 1976 the thresholds were found higher and more realistic e g vilibić and orlić 2001 in coupled models 29 23 kg m3 29 26 kg m3 and 29 26 kg m3 for med8c1 med8c2 and med8c3 respectively implying that these models are reproducing denser adriatic water masses the estimated values are in good agreement with observed densities of the southern adriatic deep waters 29 2 kg m3 vilibić and orlić 2001 mantziafou and lascaratos 2008 the pda threshold in med8f was somewhat lower 29 21 kg m3 and the lowest thresholds of 29 16 kg m3 29 16 kg m3 and 29 18 kg m3 were estimated for med12f1 med12f2 and med12f3 respectively all models but med12f3 range the averaged adw transport from approximately 1500 km3 yr to 17 000 km3 yr with substantial interannual variability fig 16 these estimates are in accordance with the estimations based on multi year current measurements in the otranto strait that may vary substantially between years 3 150 13 000 km3 yr gačić et al 1996 2002 and box model estimates for 1975 1976 9 500 12 500 km3 yr vilibić and orlić 2002 considering all models as an ensemble 1984 1987 1992 1993 2004 2008 and 2012 are the years with the strongest adw transports with the best agreement between models reached in 1993 2004 and 2006 in 1992 extremely strong adw transport is reproduced by med8f while missed in other models no adw transport is reproduced from the mid 1990s till early 2000s matching the post eastern mediterranean transient emt phase characterized by the presence of fresher waters in the whole adriatic vilibić et al 2012 which prevented the generation of the adriatic dense waters adw transports in the otranto strait are mostly connected to the mld decadal variability in the southern adriatic although they differ during some years as an example minor adw transport is modelled for 1981 1982 accompanied by almost complete mixing of the whole sap and mld almost reaching the bottom in particular in med8f model fig 15 however the adw of 1981 1982 is characterized by lower densities february 1982 average pda in the sap is 29 17 kg m3 in med8f than average february average pda in the sap is 29 26 kg m3 in med8f not shown in contrast during years 1993 2004 and 2006 we find both deep mld in the sap and large adw transports in the otranto strait corroborated in contrast to other models adw outflow in the med12f3 model is strongly underestimated or even prevented during some years the correlation factor between the maximum mld in the sap and adw transports is very low 0 1 and insignificant interannual variability of simulated adriatic dwf can also be perceived from the total volumes of dense water masses fig 17 the total volumes were estimated on a monthly basis separately for northern and southern adriatic red squares in fig 1 for the same reason as before differing water mass characteristics between models due to the salinity differences for all models pda thresholds in northern subbasin were calculated as the 95 percentile of all values while we took the same thresholds as for the adw transports fig 16 for the southern subbasin in order to preserve the consistency in the northern adriatic convection processes occur almost every year in all models with variable strength years associated with higher naddw production are 1981 1984 1987 1991 1999 2002 2006 2008 2012 visible in almost all models and most of them described in the literature e g artegiani and salusti 1987 vilibić et al 2004 vilibić and supić 2005 mihanović et al 2013 however the naddw densities are differing between models coupled models in overall are simulating denser naddw compared to the forced ones by 0 3 kg m3 with more realistic pda values except med8f as being too salty which can be ascribed to their ability for better representation of surface heat losses interesting thing to notice is the seasonal variability in total volumes winter maxima and summer minima indicating naddw short residual time period of only several months artegiani and salusti 1987 vilibić 2003 janeković et al 2014 the southern adriatic is showing different interannual variability compared to the northern adriatic but highly correlated with the adw transport at the otranto strait correlation factor between yearly averages of the two time series is between 0 86 and 0 89 significant at 99 level for all models except med12f3 in med12f3 model a weak convection appeared at the beginning of the simulation after which the dense water volumes decreased to almost zero which confirms our previous hypothesis given at the end of section 3 other models are experiencing substantial dwf in the southern adriatic during 1993 and between 2004 2006 which is in a good agreement with the literature e g vilibić and šantić 2008 mantziafou and lascaratos 2008 for these simulations the pdas threshold is in the range of suggested value by the literature 29 2 kg m3 mantziafou and lascaratos 2008 being somewhat better represented in the coupled models comparing models which differ only in one parameter i inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c3 vs non inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c2 does not result in any significant changes of dwf in the southern adriatic ii inclusion of the new river climatology in med12f2 vs old river climatology in med12f1 only slightly changes dwf properties of the southern adriatic visible in both mld and adw otranto transport reason for the latter is that the total runoff volumes between med12f1 and med12f2 are very close 3720 m3 s vs 3630 m3 s however the two models differ in the way of introducing the river discharges see sections 2 1 1 and 2 1 2 the latter doesn t affect the dwf rates however a change in total runoff discharges does verri et al 2018 5 2 adriatic ionian bimodal oscillating system bios modelled ssh is evaluated against the absolute dynamic topography adt aviso product available since 1993 with 1 8 resolution i e the sum of the sea level anomaly and mean dynamic topography as the bios represents a reversal pattern between cyclonic and anticyclonic circulation in the northern ionian sea it has been found that ssh might be used as a proxy for quantification of this process gačić et al 2010 bessiers et al 2013 mihanović et al 2015 reale et al 2017 a simple bios index equaling to the ssh difference between the centre and the perimeter of the northern ionian gyre has been constructed from the observations and successfully related to the adriatic thermohaline biogeochemical and biological decadal oscillations gačić et al 2014 mihanović et al 2015 dunić et al 2018 peharda et al 2016 2018 the bios index defined as the ssh difference between southern and northern boxes in fig 1 is estimated from both aviso measurements and from modelled ssh fig 18 sea level difference sld was computed between central and northern lateral part of the northern ionian fig 1 red squares following the analysis of gačić et al 2014 and mihanović et al 2015 seasonal signal has been removed from the measured and simulated data in order to properly distinguish interannual and decadal variability of the bios regimes positive index implies anticyclonic circulation and advection of less saline waters from the western mediterranean to the adriatic while negative index is associated with the cyclonic circulation strong liw inflow and high salinity conditions in the adriatic two anticyclonic and two cyclonic bios regimes occurred between 1993 and 2012 anticyclonic till 1997 and 2006 2010 cyclonic 1998 2004 and after 2011 forced models strongly underestimate index values during both cyclonic and anticyclonic regimes which is particularly observable between 1995 and 1997 during that time forced models provide near zero index while the measured index is quite high and exhibits a strong anticyclonic circulation in the northern ionian sea simultaneously the coupled models follow observations much better although lagging for a year in switching to the cyclonic bios regime in med8c1 and med8c3 somewhat less pronounced in med8c2 the med12f3 model fails to reproduce all bios regimes this may be due to a weak or blocked dwf outflow through the otranto strait fig 16 which is believed to be the major mechanism responsible for maintaining oscillatory patterns gačić et al 2010 for the second anticyclonic bios regime 2006 2010 all forced models again underestimate the bios index fig 18 on the other hand coupled models slightly overestimate index and prolong the anticyclonic circulation till 2011 med8c1 and med8c3 or even till the end of the investigated period med8c2 for cyclonic regimes the overall difference between modelled and observed bios indexes is much lower than for anticyclonic regimes in summary the coupled models are better in reproducing observations of which med8c3 with included aerosol trend apparently agrees best with observations the reason for this could be in both i the fact that adriatic dwf is stronger in coupled models resulting with adw dense enough up to 29 26 kg m3 compared to forced models whose densities are up to 29 21 kg m3 to cascade into the deep layers of the northern ionian and therefore provoking the reversals and ii sst relaxation term added in forced models that jams the bios reversals this issue is going to be researched in future studies interestingly and finally we see some non negligible differences between models which differ only in one parameter i inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c3 vs non inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c2 results in significantly different duration of anticyclone periods between the two models ii inclusion of the new river climatology in med12f2 vs old river climatology in med12f1 creates less pronounced but still visible differences in the northern ionian sea e g in 1997 1998 and 2008 2009 6 discussion and conclusion a constant development of the mediterranean climate ocean models during the last decade has significantly increased their reliability gualdi et al 2013 ruti et al 2016 however the adriatic sea was often omitted from assessment studies although it is known as the major dwf site for the eastern mediterranean robinson et al 2001 there are several reasons for that of which the major one is unavailability of reliable long term in situ data and the fact that the temporal and spatial scales of dominant processes are lower than in the most of the mediterranean requiring high resolution modelling to properly reproduce processes important for the thermohaline circulation e g the dwf for which high resolution atmospheric models are a requirement beg paklar et al 2001 grisogono and belušić 2009 davolio et al 2015 the first such study has been conducted by dunić et al 2018 who evaluated nemo med8 model med8f in our notation on the 1961 2012 period and found a number of shortcomings in the dwf and bios reproduction due to the model setup in this paper performance of six additional climate ocean simulations with improvements in atmospheric forcing higher spatial and temporal resolution interactive ocean atmosphere coupling river discharge old or new river climatologies interactive river model and resolution horizontal and vertical model nesting approach has been assessed model outputs have been validated on the in situ data whilst the major processes the dwf and the bios have also been evaluated the following conclusions were reached 1 forced models med8f and med12f1 f2 generally overestimate temperature and salinity this overestimation is most pronounced in med8f model where positive temperature and salinity biases are present throughout the water column in all studied areas on the other hand med12f3 overestimates temperature but because of its large shortcoming regarding the e p r budget significantly underestimates salinity throughout the water column in all studied areas 2 coupled models generally underestimate salinity as a result of underrepresented liw with an exception of the northern adriatic surface layer at which salinity is overestimated probably due to the river discharge underrepresentation and interestingly at the otranto strait where salinity is larger than in forced models throughout the water column except med8f 3 when comparing two model sets which differ only in one parameter we conclude that both i inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c3 vs non inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c2 and ii inclusion of the new river climatology in med12f2 vs old river climatology in med12f1 only slightly changed thermohaline properties of the adriatic water masses 4 liw intrusion is modelled better by higher resolution forced models med12f1 f2 than by lower resolution med8 models biases at liw intrusion depth are lowest in med12f1 f2 models in addition to resolution differences this might also be due to the configuration differences between med8 and med12 models affecting the processes in the levantine and ionian basins which influenced the liw depth at the otranto strait found at 200 m in med12f1 f2 models and below 200 m in med8 models unfortunately no long term monitoring of thermohaline properties had been applied in the otranto strait while occasional campaigns put the liw core between 150 and 400 m gačić et al 1996 malanotte rizzoli et al 1997 kršinić and grbec 2002 manca et al 2002 5 all models underestimate dwf in the northern adriatic if looking only at model to measurement bias values dwf is reproduced better with coupled models med8c1 c3 than with forced models med12f1 f3 this is mostly due to the fact that heat losses are 20 30 higher in coupled models than in forced models and thus larger volumes of waters of higher densities are generated in coupled models however forced models better reproduce spatial properties of dwf but this is primarily due to higher resolution of forcing atmospheric model and thus to more realistic spatial representation of atmospheric heat fluxes i e their proper positioning in space and better representation of the domain 6 med12f3 was not able to properly simulate southern adriatic dwf its outflow through the otranto strait and the liw counterflow different oceanic initial conditions than other med12f models low spin up duration and or overestimated e p r budget lower freshwater fluxes led to underrepresented salinity of the whole basin which damped the convection processes in the southern adriatic just a few years after the beginning of the simulation 7 nevertheless all models except med12f3 are unsuccessfully reproducing dwf in the northernmost part of the northern adriatic this is likely due to a strong underestimation in wind and heat fluxes within the trieste bora jet and due to overspreading of river waters to dwf site low salinity waters spread too far from the coastline resulting in an increased stratification that preconditions the dwf and therefore reduce the area where the naddw is generated 8 the only two models in which spatial positioning of primary northern adriatic dwf site is properly reproduced are med8f and med12f3 but with the former one strongly overestimating densities of generated waters due to overestimated salinities within the model and the latter strongly underestimating densities of generated waters due to underestimations of salinity within the model a common difference between med8f and other studied models is the distribution of the river mouths med8f has just two river mouths in the north whereas other models have 7 medc1 c3 or more med12f1 f3 river mouths cumulative river discharge through these river sources is similar for all models fig 2 however apparently too much fresh waters is put into other models at locations to the east of the po river which has been known to overfreshen the water column and not allow for dense water generation at the open northern adriatic dwf site vilibić et al 2016 9 a further proof that the dwf in the northern adriatic has been underestimated may be found in both dense water collectors of the naddw the jabuka pit and the sap where the modelled temperatures have the largest positive bias for all models the direct consequence is an overestimation of the convection depth in the sap where the open convection in most models has been found to reach bottom or near bottom layers while the literature does not record the mld deeper than 900 m 10 coupled models reproduce better the bios index which has been found to describe the decadal oscillations in the adriatic thermohaline properties however a question is if such a simplified index may be a proper proxy for the modelled bios as models were found to inadequately map the spatial patterns related to bios dunić et al 2018 further research should be carried out on this topic by examining the bios spatial patterns mihanović et al 2015 bessiers et al 2013 11 when comparing two model sets which differ only in one parameter we conclude that i inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c3 vs non inclusion of aerosol trend in med8c2 influences bios circulation in the northern ionian but not as much the adriatic dwf processes and that ii inclusion of the new river climatology in med12f2 vs old river climatology in med12f1 does not significantly influence dwf processes in the northern and southern adriatic but slightly influences bios circulation in the northern ionian to rank the importance of different variables and processes the dwf and the bios variables have been correlated to their potential drivers in the ocean wintertime ndjf net heat fluxes over northern and southern areas denoted as squares 1 and 2 in fig 1 salt content and river discharges fig 19 a for the dwf in the northern adriatic the correlation between naddw density february pda and northern adriatic salinity is found to be the most significant for all models a weaker connection is documented between february pda and ndjf net heat fluxes ranking the heat loss effect less important for naddw density than the salt content also different slopes between the february pda and ndjf net heat fluxes indicate that the cooling rate for the same amount of energy loss varies between the models which is largely caused by the effect of different domains between med8 and med12 models lastly the february pda is weakly correlated to river discharges in the northern adriatic ranking the interannual variations in the northern adriatic freshwater load of minor importance to the total dwf in comparison to the salinity content this is due to the bios induced interannual and decadal variations and to the wintertime cooling however as shown before spreading of freshwater masses significantly influences spatial distribution of dwf processes for the dwf occurring in the sap fig 19b the same ranking of contributors for the adw outflow over the otranto strait is suggested as for the northern adriatic but with weaker connections both salinity and ndjf heat losses are equally shaping the modelled adw outflow towards the ionian sea while the rivers don t play a significant role there is a substantial difference between forced and coupled models the forced models are better correlated with february salinity while the coupled models are more dependent on the wintertime heat losses the connection between the bios index and its drivers e g adw outflow through the otranto strait or mld depth in the sap has not however been established with significant levels as indicated by dunić et al 2018 the circulation patterns associated with the bios may spatially differ between the models which may not be properly described by a simple bios index therefore either more complex methods should be applied to capture bios spatial patterns or better variables should be defined for the bios drivers and to ascribe them to the decadal variations in the adriatic thermohaline properties although presenting the state of the art numerical physical oceanographic simulations on a decadal time scales nemo med models are still affected by a number of limitations concerning the adriatic ionian basin these effects are more pronounced as process scales in the adriatic are smaller than in the open mediterranean sea coarse resolution horizontal and vertical is affecting the mixing circulation dynamics and spreading of water masses especially on the shallow areas such as the northern adriatic the higher resolution of the upper layers may resolve the shallow water processes mellor et al 2002 while higher horizontal resolution could improve bottom flow and intense mesoscale cyclonic anticyclonic dynamics that moderates the northern adriatic dwf kuzmić et al 2006 as it was seen in the performance of the med12f3 model because of its higher horizontal resolution of 0 03 this model was able to reproduce the water mass dynamics of the northern adriatic open waters better than other models however the greatest med12f3 shortage was high underestimation of the basin wide salinity content due to the underrepresented e p r budget which led to an overall deficiency of adriatic dwf reproduction this accents a necessity for introduction of high resolution coupled modelling and proper overall freshwater budget for reproduction of processes in coastal regions such as the northern adriatic such as used in short term atmosphere ocean simulations warner et al 2010 another important factor when it comes to the convection processes is their triggering strong and cold wind outbreaks which require high resolution representation of the atmospheric forcing combined with realistic air sea interactions performance of all three coupled models because of their ability to explicitly resolve atmosphere ocean coupling was better than performance of the forced models in a sense of both dwf processes and the northern ionian bimodal reversals still coupled and forced models were of different resolution thus proper assessment of resolution vs coupling effects cannot be achieved however the evaluation of the coupled models at jp and d1200 stations adriatic depressions reveal a drawback in the salinity content inside the adriatic basin which resulted in fresher adw masses it is worth noting that the current 7 simulation ensemble should be considered as an ensemble of opportunity which has not been designed specifically to study the influence of model configuration individual elements on the adriatic sea representation this often precludes the possibility to reach final conclusions on attributing the differences obtained between the ensemble members in light of the documented model performances this study might be used for proper tuning of future models in the adriatic ionian basin for example we can recommend that the future studies should use coupled models with higher resolution and proper river discharges to document mesoscale processes that are common for the adriatic this is particularly relevant for future scenario runs as there is a great uncertainty if the thermohaline circulation i e the dense water formation and the bios will weaken in the future climate as indicated by the observations vilibić et al 2013 through lower ventilation of deep layers that will increase the hypoxic conditions degobbis et al 2000 djakovac et al 2012 a weakening of the circulation might have a disastrous consequence on the whole biogeochemistry of the region thus the trophic chain and fisheries which can be properly addressed only by reliable climate models acknowledgements to all developers of the nemo med models and to all

24059,in this research a three dimensional coupled wave circulation model including meteorological forcing freshwater inflow and time varying open boundary conditions for new river inlet is validated a mechanistic approach is taken to investigate how various wave current interaction mechanisms affect the nearshore circulation plume expansion and surface wave field in the plume region of a relatively small partially mixed tidal estuarine system more specifically focus is comparing four different modeling cases including 1 a three dimensional ocean circulation model no wave effects 2 a coupled wave circulation model 3 a coupled wave and circulation model including vertical mixing enhancement due to wave breaking and 4 a wave model without surface current effects findings reveal forces are applied by incoming waves due to various wave current interaction mechanisms wave momentum released by incoming waves pushes the outgoing freshwater ebb plume back to the shoreline and prevents the plume from expanding freely towards the open ocean findings also reveals that releasing wave dissipated energy in the expanding plume region enhances vertical mixing mixes down freshwater and therefore thickens the plume these results are congruent with observations at the mouth of the columbia river keywords wave current interaction tidal inlet river plume wind waves three dimensional circulation wave breaking 1 introduction dynamical interaction of the surface gravity waves and stratified flows is not well understood nearshore incident gravity waves encounter relatively strong opposing currents at the edge of an expanding freshwater plume thomson et al 2014 these strong opposing currents in most cases super critical flow make waves that experience rapid changes including shoaling refraction convergence and breaking particularly short period surface waves steepen and become physically unstable e g breaking and blocking at the edge and inside of the plume region akan et al 2017 2018 the wave breaking starts from the high frequency part of the wave spectrum and extracts energy and momentum from surface waves in other words the high speed opposing current at the edge and at the surface of the plume region acts like a low pass filter which lets only the lower frequency part of the surface wave spectrum e g swells to pass the plume region and reach to the shoreline or the tidal inlet entrance area the extracted energy and momentum affect nearshore three dimensional circulation considerably gerbi et al 2013 moghimi et al 2016 this process results in significant enhancement in the position size shape and other characteristics of the expanding tidal freshwater plume and modifies incident wave field features recent field observations at the columbia river showed that incoming short period gravity waves which are experiencing a super critical opposing current at the plume front break and lose significant amounts of energy and momentum at the plume region thomson et al 2014 compared observations from two days with similar tidal forcing and river discharge but with different wave conditions this demonstrated that the plume thickness and its extent differs between the two cases substantially it was speculated that the injected energy due to wave breaking enhances turbulence quantities and vertical mixing and therefore is the main mechanism for the very different plume thickness demonstrated during these two days this hypothesis is not yet fully validated in a realistic modeling study akan et al 2017 employed a coupled wave and three dimensional ocean circulation model to study wave current interaction at the columbia river freshwater plume the study showed how various mechanisms for exchanging momentum between incoming surface gravity waves and expanding large freshwater plumes affect plume and wave characteristics however the role of extracted energy from breaking waves in vertical mixing enhancement and its effects on the expanding freshwater plume characteristics were not investigated moghimi et al 2016 performed a series of modeling experiments using a two equation turbulence closure model to provide a quantitative description of the effects of energy released by surface breaking waves and to identify the relationship with turbulence kinetic dissipation rates inside the water column at the new river inlet nc their modeling system similar to the common coupled wave and three dimensional coastal ocean circulation models checked the consistency and applicability of state of the art coupled modeling systems in terms of energy exchange between surface waves and the ocean water columns using a one dimensional vertical water column turbulence model they suggested use of a vertical mixing parametrization to relate dissipated energy from surface breaking waves to vertical distribution of turbulent dissipation rates inside the wave affected part of the water column three times the significant wave heights from the ocean surface one of the primary objectives for this current study is to investigate the mechanism of turbulent kinetic energy tke injection from the surface wave field and to study its role in enhancing vertical mixing and modifying plume physical features new river inlet nc was the site of an intensive observation campaign during april june 2012 several modeling methods and observational research were utilized to study various aspect of tidal circulation wave current interaction sediment transport morphology lagrangian drifters dispersion and dye release transport chen et al 2015 spydell et al 2015 feddersen et al 2016 olabarrieta et al 2014 however to the best of our knowledge in all conducted modeling studies the new river inlet was considered as a well mixed shallow inlet without considering river and catchment area freshwater inflow and precipitation effects feddersen et al 2016 recently presented a dye release study based on modeling and in situ observation for the same measurement campaign although the modeling study was done assuming the well mixed inlet system i e no stratification the authors stated the importance of investigating the wave effects on tidal inlet flow in a full three dimensional ocean circulation setting based on the vertical salinity observation presented in their study and discharge information available for new river we identified a direct connection between precipitation events and vertical salinity gradient i e formation of ebb tidal freshwater plume for example the stratified freshwater plume reported in this paper for may 18 2012 is a consequence of a relatively minor precipitation event for may 17 2012 fig 1 looking at the frequency of the rain events with similar or more severe precipitation reveals that during the year 2012 more than 60 events with similar or larger river inflow were observed fig 2 therefore it is necessary to apply a full three dimensional model for new river estuary as a partially mixed tidal system to address questions concerning processes such as sediment and pollution transport morphology or biogeochemical activities in the new river inlet the energy and momentum exchange of out going tidal jet and incoming waves are of the same comparable order of magnitude this makes new river inlet an ideal system to study the wave current plume interaction as opposed to the systems like the columbia river where the out going momentum flux from the tidal plume is several orders of magnitude larger than the momentum flux input by the waves therefore vertical mixing enhancement due to inclusion of surface flux of energy from wave dissipation and wave momentum exchange show a considerable impact on the freshwater plume characteristics e g volume and location in a tidal cycle time scale the purpose of this paper is twofold first we present a three dimensional coupled ocean circulation and wave model for the new river estuary system covering from river to ocean this is the first time that a three dimensional coupled circulation model including meteorological forcing freshwater inflow and time varying open boundary conditions for the new river inlet is validated and becomes available to the scientific community this is especially important because of the very rich oceanographic data sets which are still being used in various on going research activities secondly we also take a mechanistic approach to investigate how various wave current interaction mechanisms affect the nearshore circulation plume expansion and surface wave field in the plume region of a relatively small partially mixed tidal estuarine system more specifically we concentrate on comparing four different modeling cases including 1 three dimensional ocean circulation model no wave effects 2 coupled wave circulation model 3 coupled wave and circulation model including vertical mixing enhancement due to wave breaking and 4 wave model without surface current effects the organization of this paper is as follows section 2 describes the circulation wave and turbulence models sections 3 1 and 3 2 presents model set up and validation of the results against the observation sections 3 3 and 4 describe modeling experiments design and results section 5 provides discussions over various aspects of wave current interaction and its dynamical effects on waves and freshwater plume section 6 concludes the paper with a summary of the main findings and outlooks 2 methods 2 1 the model system we carried out numerical experiments for this study using the coawst coupled model system developed by warner et al 2008 it should be noted that the role of the atmospheric subsystem as a model component in the coupled application is not considered the atmospheric information were treated as the input data i e external forcing read by wave and ocean circulation components in terms of wave forcing in the governing equation of the ocean circulation model we employed an implementation of vortex force vf formalism by kumar et al 2012 following mcwilliams et al 2004 and uchiyama et al 2010 we utilized the three dimensional coastal ocean model roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 and the third generation wind wave model swan booij et al 1999 as our main modeling components for this study roms is a three dimensional free surface terrain following system which is designed to solve the primitive nonlinear hydrostatic equations with the boussinesq assumption the wave averaged momentum equation reads as 1 u t u u w u z f z u φ f d z u w ν u z k j f w 2 φ z g ρ ρ 0 k z k 3 u w z 0 where u w are quasi eulerian mean velocities f is the coriolis parameter φ is the dynamic pressure f is the non wave non conservative force d represents the diffusive terms j k is the vortex force and k is the lower order bernoulli head as described in mcwilliams et al 2004 fw is the non conservative wave forces an overbar indicates time average and a prime indicates turbulent fluctuating quantity see kumar et al 2012 for implementation details swan is a phase averaged wave model that solves the wave action balance equation to predict the evolution of frequency directional wave spectra due to the effects of bathymetry water depth and ambient currents the model accounts for sources and sinks of wave action for each spectral component due to the effects of wind input white capping or depth induced wave breaking dissipation wave induced bottom drag dissipation and nonlinear triad or quadruplets interactions the effects of the tidal current and water level variation on the wave modeling results and wave forcing in ocean circulation were taken into account in a two way coupled fashion the governing equation for wave action balance komen et al 1994 n e ω wave θ ω wave reads as 4 n t x c g u n c ω wave n ω wave c θ n θ s tot ω wave where e defined as the wave energy at relative angular frequency ω wave propagating at an angle of θ c g is the intrinsic wave group velocity vector u is ambient current velocity vector and x is the horizontal geographic coordinate system the propagation velocities in spectral space ω wave θ are given by c ω wave and cθ the terms on the left hand side of the equation are responsible for local changes and propagation of the wave energy the right hand side of the equation represents source and sink terms associated with wave generation dissipation and nonlinear wave wave interactions where 5 s tot s in s nl s ds w s ds br s ds b s in is the energy input from wind to the wave field s nl is the nonlinear wave wave interaction s ds b is the dissipation due to bottom friction s ds br is the dissipation due to depth induced surface wave breaking and s ds w is the dissipation due to white capping at the surface we define total surface dissipation as s ds s s ds br s ds w 2 2 wave enhanced turbulence and vertical mixing surface breaking waves inject tke in the ocean surface layer which modifies its turbulence and mixing properties kitaigorodskii et al 1983 thorpe 1984 umlauf and burchard 2003 introduced a generic length scale two equation turbulence closure model which is also able to consider wave injected turbulence as a shear free production craig and banner 1994 burchard 2001 they suggested that the surface boundary condition for turbulent kinetic energy k could be approximated by a flux boundary condition 6 f k s ν turb σ k k z in which f k s is the flux of energy injected to the surface of the ocean due to surface wave dissipation here ν turb is the vertical eddy viscosity and σk is the turbulence schmidt number mellor and yamada 1982 z is the positive upward vertical coordinate the surface flux of tke f k s can be directly obtained from an ocean wave model in terms of computed surface wave dissipation terms jenkins 1989 by f k s wave β s s ds s where β s is a constant recent studies and inter comparison of the model results and available observations suggest that the k ω two equation turbulence closure model is well suited for wave enhanced turbulence and mixing studies for near shore and estuarine applications jones and monismith 2008 moghimi et al 2013 moghimi et al 2016 employed a high resolution k ω turbulence closure model and were able to fully resolve turbulence dissipation rate profiles close to the ocean surface they compared their model results with observations from surface wave instrument floats with tracking swifts in the nearshore region at new river inlet for the april june 2012 observation campaign thomson 2012 for the present study we employed k ω two equation turbulence closure model by setting the generic length scale turbulence closure model coefficients and stability function following carniel et al 2009 and kantha and clayson 2004 the turbulence model receives surface flux of tke and surface roughness from the wave model the surface flux of tke is a summation of all wave dissipation terms at the surface i e β s 1 and the surface roughness z 0 s is calculated as a fraction of the significant wave height h s by z 0 s 0 6 h s moghimi et al 2016 2 3 plume geometrical properties to evaluate and compare numerical experiments we defined some of the physical and geometrical properties of the freshwater plume gerbi et al 2013 the calculated parameters include freshwater plume centroid position plume surface area and plume average thickness we computed these parameters for the freshwater plume exited from the inlet entrance towards ocean at x 0 m we defined the freshwater plume as the water less saline than 35 2 psu then we calculated the plume centroid and plume average thickness from the freshwater concentration parameter defined by gerbi et al 2013 as 7 f s 0 s s 0 where s is salinity and s 0 35 2 the x and z centroid are defined as 8 x v x f d v v f d v 9 z v z f d v v f d v where v is the total volume of the freshwater plume x and z are the local coordinate of each freshwater parcel dv we computed the average plume thickness by dividing the total volume v to the plume surface area sp 3 numerical modeling 3 1 model set up the new river estuary nre is located in southeastern north carolina in the united states it connects the new river to the atlantic ocean via the new river inlet see blue rectangle in fig 3 a this is a relatively shallow estuary system with mean depth of 2 m at the entrance it consists of two channels the main channel is maintained in a specific range of depths by dredging for marine transportation purposes with a maximum depth of about 10 m the maximum tidal range at the entrance is less than 2 m and waves greater than 1 5 m approach the inlet entrance area in storm conditions the water depth increases to about 15 m within 5 km from the shoreline towards open ocean we constructed our models bathymetry by combining historical data and recent surveys at the new river inlet entrance region the numerical models bathymetry for both regional and local cases red and blue rectangles in fig 3 b are mainly based on a u s army corps of engineers survey in august 2010 we also updated the inlet entrance region by their survey conducted on may 10 2012 due to the importance of the complicated tidal channel system in circulation of the new river estuary and its inlet region macmahan et al 2014 we used aerial information from the google earth database to reconstruct the tidal channels in some areas without direct bathymetrical information primarily for the regional circulation model the model grid contains two levels of nested domains with increasing horizontal resolution to resolve the detailed physical processes in the ocean side and bay side of the inlet entrance specification of the model parameters for each grid are presented in table 1 the regional grid red rectangle in fig 3 encompasses the estuary and extends offshore onto the continental shelf to water depths of 30 m the local grid blue rectangle in fig 3 has a relatively fine resolution extending about 9 km out onto the continental shelf to water depths of about 14 m the local cartesian coordinate system x y is introduced where x is directed toward offshore and y directed alongshore respectively fig 4 we initialized the regional grid using navy coastal ocean model ncom salinity and temperature in the ocean side and linearly interpolated salinity from the shoreline to 15 psu towards land at the end of the computational grid based on available limited observations koroknay 2012 we spun up the circulation model for the regional grid for three months based on estimated flushing time of 64 days for the new river estuary ensign et al 2004 we forced the regional circulation model by the main 8 tidal constituents using oregon state university tidal inversion software otps egbert and erofeeva 2002 which applies tidal elevation and depth averaged velocities at the open boundaries we applied the non tidal forcing at the open boundary by interpolating non tidal water elevation from three hourly ncom results we did not apply non tidal velocities at the boundary which might have some effects in the vicinity of the regional coarse model boundary however since the local fine model boundary is far from the coarse grid boundary we believe that the local model solution is not affected we constructed temperature and salinity boundary conditions from three hourly three dimensional ncom outputs for the regional model we ran the standalone circulation model of the regional grid for the whole simulation period including spin up and the observation period then we extracted required initial and boundary conditions for the local grid blue grid in fig 3 which were used to execute standalone and coupled cases we did not include the first couple of hours of our simulations in our analysis considering initial adjustment moving from a coarse to a fine resolution we reduced this transition time by using non uniform grid sizes in a way that the grid sizes of the coarse and the fine grids around the boundary of the local set up fine became comparable based on available observations a moderate rain event triggers a noticeable freshwater ebb plume that will be mixed away in a couple of tidal cycles fig 1 apart from the direct precipitation at the surface of the estuary the main source of the fresh water is the new river and some other tributaries which are also mainly driven by direct run off at each rain event we used the usgs observation station at gum branch jacksonville as a reference for the new river discharge due to limited discharge measurements for other tributaries inflow to the system and the fact that most of the fresh water inflow is directly triggered by precipitation run off we assumed that their discharge specifications are similar to the new river therefore we scaled the discharge for the 6 major tributaries based on limited available discharge measurements koroknay 2012 we imposed the meteorological forcing as a combination of the national centers for environmental prediction ncep north american regional reanalysis narr and in situ measurements during the entire simulation period we forced a spatially constant and time variable forcing when the in situ measurements were available mainly for the month of may 2012 we also reduced narr short wave radiation for an average bias of 15 based on comparing available in situ measurements during may 2012 we used narr precipitation information over the new river system for the whole simulation period we forced the wave model local grid by spectral boundary conditions derived from noaa buoy station 41012 located at 30 042n 80 534w the spectra were discretized into 55 frequency and 90 direction bins we extended frequency axes to cover 0 025 to 2 5 hz to resolve the wave dissipation in high frequency tail of the wave spectrum following moghimi et al 2016 where hz is the number of cycles per second the wave model was forced by the same wind as the circulation model and was executed in the third generation mode for other wave model physical parameters we employed white capping dissipation by van der westhuysen et al 2007 bottom dissipation by hasselmann et al 1973 wind input yan 1987 3 2 validation the new river inlet was the site of an intensive observation campaign in april june 2012 as a part of the data assimilation and remote sensing for littoral application darla project jessup et al 2011 and rivet i riverine and estuarine transport experiment supported by the office of naval research observations include in situ meteorology wave buoys bottom mounted pressure gauges current velocity water column temperature and salinity as well as airborne and tower based video infrared and radar remote sensing see fig 4 during the observation period there was a rain event on may 17 2012 that triggered a freshwater plume formation at the new river inlet to be able to investigate this event we conducted our coupled modeling experiments from 14 to 19 of may 2012 we defined our base model as the coupled roms and swan model hereafter cpl which was forced by realistic meteorology tide and wave boundary conditions we employed available observations from in situ measurement stations fig 1 to validate our base model results wind speed and direction from the meteorological pile are shown in fig 1 a from 14 to 19 may 2012 we encountered two different wind conditions with the similar average wind speed of 6 m s 1 however the wind direction changed almost 180 from an onshore directed to an offshore directed wind system in this paper we will primarily focus on the two ebb events occurring during may 18 2012 where the offshore directed wind prevails the hourly mean discharge of the new river at the usgs station located at gum jacksonville nc is shown in fig 1 c due to a rain event a sudden increase in the discharge from 1 to 5 m3s 1 on may 17 2012 is observable we also plotted the frequency histogram of the hourly mean discharge of new river for the whole 2012 period in fig 2 there are more than 60 rain fall events with discharge greater than 5 m3s 1 the significant wave height comparison between the wave model and in situ measurement at wave buoy see fig 4 for buoy location is presented in fig 1 e and f the modeled and observed time series of significant wave height show small bias and rms errors comparison between the water surface elevation from the coupled model and the bottom mounted pressure gauge see fig 4 for the sensor location is shown in fig 1 g and h the modeled and observed time series of water surface elevation are well correlated and represent very small bias and rms errors the surface and bottom salinity at the wire walker fig 4 for the sensor location are given in fig 1 i i j k and l the fresh water inflow event on may 17 2012 resulted in generation of a freshwater plume that is captured in both the model and in observation of surface and bottom salinity it should be noted that the wire walker provided the whole water column salinity and temperature however here we averaged the first and last half meter of the water column to calculate surface and bottom salinity and temperature observations then we compared the interpolated model values with the resulted observations given the difficulties for constructing the freshwater forcing files we think that the model and data comparison specifically for the surface salinity with bias and rms errors of less than 0 2 psu is in acceptable range however the model still missed the freshwater inflow event at 1800 may 17 2012 since there was not a significant variability in water column temperature based on wirewalker observation we will only concentrate on salinity differences as the main driver for the observed and modeled density variations given that fact the contribution of extreme events in processes like sediment transport are significant 3 3 experimental design in this section we defined the numerical experiments that we used to test our hypotheses on the mechanisms in which surface gravity waves and inlet hydraulics interacts and leads to modifying physical characteristics of an expanding freshwater plume as well as incident surface gravity waves our main hypotheses are strong opposing surface currents in an expanding plume region cause incident surface waves to steepen and become physically unstable and break this results in enhancing wave breaking and extracting energy and momentum from waves and therefore injection of a substantial amount of energy and momentum into the water column momentum injected during wave breaking and shoaling in plume region exerts forces against plume expansion and confines the plume to the inlet entrance area energy injected during wave breaking enhances turbulence and vertical mixing and reduces plume surface signature and increases plume thickness our numerical experiments to test these hypotheses includes four model runs for the new river inlet local set up as no wav a standalone ocean circulation model results without wave effects cpl a coupled wave and ocean circulation model in this case a two way dynamical coupling is employed in which the wave model provides the wave forcing terms to the ocean circulation and the ocean circulation model provides water surface elevation and current field to the wave model however effects of injected energy due to surface wave breaking on enhancing vertical mixing is not included cpl tke similar to the cpl case plus the ocean circulation model also receives wave dissipation at the surface as a source of tke to force its turbulence closure model for enhancing vertical mixing due to energy injection from surface breaking waves no cur wave model simulation including water level variation however not including surface current we initialized all simulations with the same initial condition on may 17 2012 at 01 00 utc extracted from the realistic coupled simulation cpl explained in section 3 2 and compared the simulations results during may 18 2012 to make the wave effects more pronounced while maintaining the results as a realistic simulation we applied a constant in time and spatially variable wave boundary conditions of may 15 2012 1200 utc for the simulation period with significant wave height of 1 3 m see green vector fig 5 d 4 results comparison of the modeled salinity for vertical transects at y 1700 m transect b in fig 4 and sea surface salinity for a snapshot of the departing freshwater plume on may 18 2012 6 30 utc reveals the significance of inclusion of wave forcing mechanisms on the extent and vertical distribution of the plume structure fig 5 plume extent for no wav without wave solution extended to x 2200 m fig 5 a and b and for cpl wave momentum exchange decreased to x 1700 m fig 5 c d however the plume extent for cpl tke which has both wave momentum and energy exchange vertical mixing enhancement included shows a significant reduction in its surface signature and its plume extent reaches to x 1400 m fig 5 e f cpl results show a slightly thicker freshwater plume around the front in comparison with no wav as it clearly pushed towards the shoreline because of momentum exchange with the incident wave however for cpl tke the enhanced downward wave related mixing show a pronounced change in plume extent as freshwater mixed downwards and the vertical salinity gradient reduced significantly both in the ocean and the land side of the plume region comparing surface salinity at the entrance region inside the mouth for cpl and cpl tke cases shows that the enhanced mixing at the front and plume region result in more saline surface current and less horizontal and vertical stratification even inside the estuary based on the distance perpendicular to the shore line from x 0 m along the transect at y 1700 m transect b in fig 4 and also assuming cpl as the base run we can deduce that not considering wave momentum exchange no wav increases the maximum extent of the freshwater plume by more than 20 furthermore inclusion of wave dissipation in turbulence closure reduces the plume maximum extent by 20 for this specific transect therefore both vertical salinity profiles and surface snapshots for the above mentioned cases confirm our hypotheses to further investigate our hypotheses and examine the differences in a quantitative manner we present the time evolution of the plume geometrical properties for the above mentioned cases fig 6 here x is the cross shore distance of the position of the freshwater plume centroid in the local coordinate system fig 4 z is the positive upward vertical coordinate with zero at the mean sea level we compared two ebb events on may 18 2012 6 30 utc dashed line and may 18 2012 18 30 utc solid line in fig 6 on may 18 2012 6 30 utc the plume centroid for no wav goes out towards open ocean for both peak ebb cases up to x max 900 m however these values for both coupled cases show that the fresh water plume did not go that far x max 800 m fig 6 a for the second ebb event on may 18 2012 18 30 utc a clear distinction between three cases is visible for this ebb no wav cpl and cpl tke plume centroid goes towards the ocean for x max 900 m x max 800 m and x max 750 m respectively fig 6 a the vertical position of the freshwater plume centroid for both ebb situations shows similar results for both ebb situations no wav freshwater plume is more concentrated towards the surface and cpl tke plume is more distributed inside the water column therefore the plume centroid for the cpl tke run is deeper compared to the other cases which suggests increased vertical mixing in the cpl tke case fig 6 b comparison of the freshwater plume surface reveals that no wav generates the largest and cpl tke produced the smallest plume surface area fig 6 c using freshwater plume volume and surface we can compute an estimate of plume thickness where no wav shows the thinnest thickness 1 3 m and cpl tke presents the thickest plume thickness 2 1 m this results in a reduction of the surface area of the freshwater plume by considering wave effects in both mixing and momentum equations figs 6 d 5 b d and f our modeling results confirm our hypotheses concerning mechanics of forces applied by incoming waves due to various wave current interaction mechanisms wave momentum released by incoming waves pushes the outgoing freshwater ebb plume back to the shoreline and prevent the plume from expanding freely towards the open ocean it also reveals that releasing wave dissipated energy in the expanding plume region enhances vertical mixing mixes down freshwater and therefore thickens the plume these results are in agreement with thomson et al 2014 observations at the mouth of the columbia river to further discuss and quantify the role of each of the various wave current interaction mechanisms we examined some aspects of these processes in the following section 5 discussion 5 1 plume extent evolution in time here we investigate the time dependent dynamics of the wave current interaction effects on an expanding freshwater plume using the hovmoller diagrams of the relative surface divergence nondimensionalized surface divergence by the coriolis frequency relative divergence is plotted at transect a at x 1500 m parallel to the shoreline in the ocean side of the inlet entrance and transect b at y 1700 m perpendicular to the shoreline figs 7 and 8 location shown in fig 4 surface divergence is an indicator of the plume front location that can be calculated when the three dimensional velocity field is available at the front a strong down welling current causes a convergence zone and hence a negative divergence therefore in the above mentioned figures the negative divergence regions in blue represent the plume front location fig 7represents the width of the plume passes in time through the transect a during the first ebb on may 18 2012 the plume maximum width of no wav is about 5 km cpl is 3 6 km and cpl tke is about 2 5 km in this specific ebb situation and because of the wind condition the plume turns to the negative x direction since y 0 m is right in front of the entrance were the powerful ebb jet enters the ocean for almost all of the cases the plume reaches to transect a at t 5 h however the plume front of no wav stayed beyond x 1500 m for a long time and advected towards negative y eventually it returns closer to the shoreline however the plume front of cpl tke returns sooner also there is a noticeable difference between no wav and cpl which is more obvious in the second ebb event return of the plume front happens slower than the cpl case as an index of how wave forcing could affect plume front location and its dynamics fig 8represents the extent of the plume front towards open ocean along the transect b in time during may 18 2012 the plume extent of cpl tke is the smallest along the transect b in comparison with two other cases we calculated the front propagation speed for the first ebb frontal feature starting from x 1500 m around time 5 hour based on our calculation the front propagation speed for no wav is about 190 m h cpl is about 140 m h and cpl tke is about 110 m h for this specific transect x 1500 2500 the propagation velocity reduced by a factor of two from no wav to cpl tke plume front of no wav cpl and cpl tke cases reach their maximum distance from the entrance in 10 8 5 and 7 h brando et al 2015 compared remotely sensed sea surface temperature and results from a wave atmosphere and ocean coupled modeling system cowast they achieved a qualitative agreement between their modeling results and sea surface temperature from remote sensing device at sub mesoscale and mesoscale for some of the major rivers plume in another study we employed a coupled wave and ocean circulation model with higher spatial resolution nested inside the current local model for the new river inlet we see that surface divergence of cpl case with realistic wave forcing qualitatively matches back scatter pattern in terasar ortiz suslow et al 2015 image spatially and temporally we also did some comparisons between one minute averaged x band radar díaz méndez et al 2015 back scatter and surface divergence of model results and see qualitative match not shown here 5 2 wave current interaction and plume extent in space to demonstrate how wave current interaction modifies plume spatial extent and wave field properties we compared results of the cases at the transect b located at y 1700 m shown in fig 4 on may 18 2012 6 30 utc fig 9 we define the freshwater plume region where the δsalt bottom and surface salinity differences parameter fig 9 d presents significant difference between bottom and surface salinity for this specific transect on may 18 2012 6 30 utc the local x coordinate of the approximate plume lift off and front are given in table 2 wave height evolution for both coupled cases cpl and cpl tke and wave model without current effects no cur are shown in fig 9 a we also plotted the differences between wave height and its running mean to magnify their changes around the plume front the wave height is decreasing while propagating towards shoreline the main dissipation process before the waves encounter the plume is the bottom dissipation the δhsig line plots for cpl and cpl tke cases show a clear wave shoaling due to strong opposing current at the edge of the plume fronts x1700 m and x1300 m for cpl and cpl tke respectively this is followed by an enhancement in surface wave dissipation and a reduction of wave height at the front position fig 9 b surface waves after passing the front and entering into the plume region still experience an opposing current as well as reduction in water depth which reflects in wave height by a slight shoaling and further wave dissipation these effects are observable in both coupled cases results in the wave only case no cur the wave height decays with the same slope parallel to the coupled cases however excluding the opposing current from this simulation resulted in reducing wave dissipation and therefore greater significant wave height obviously the δhsig line plot for the wave only case no cur does not show any sign of the plume front location evolution of wave spectrum for waves traveling across the plume front and finally arriving at the shallow regions where depth induced breaking actively drains wave energy is presented in fig 10 the energy difference between point p09 to p68 represents both bottom dissipation and surface dissipation due to opposing current induced wave breaking at the plume front and inside the plume region wave surface dissipation for cpl and cpl tke are shown in fig 9 b we also added the differences between wave surface dissipation and its running mean to magnify their changes around the plume front noticeable increases in wave surface dissipation are shown for both coupled cases where the incoming wave meets the expanding plume fronts of cpl and cpl tke at x 1700 m and x 1400 m respectively as it is explained by moghimi et al 2016 wave dissipation due to opposing current implemented in swan wave model by van der westhuysen et al 2007 considers this effect and is calibrated for a limited range of opposing velocities applicable to the new river inlet case however for settings like the mouth of the columbia river where extreme opposing current velocities reaches to 3 ms 1 needs to be validated and require consideration of modifications with an explanation of the findings the sum of all wave averaged momentum terms including vertical j vortex force k vortex force and non conservative surface wave breaking terms as well as the total acceleration for all of the cases are shown in fig 9 c see eq 1 here we observe peaks in wave momentum that coincide with the enhanced wave dissipation regions at the plume front for both coupled cases fig 9 b however the raise in cpl is sharper and more pronounced and follows the same pattern as the horizontal gradient in δsalt bottom and surface salinity differences and δu surface and bottom velocity velocity shown in fig 9 d and e incraesed wave momentum against the exiting ebb jet results in reduction of total acceleration the wave force essentially pushes the plume back to the inlet entrance region and will not let it expand freely towards open ocean the same pattern for both cpl and cpl tke cases can be seen however they are different in terms of location and horizontal gradient which also relate back to wave current dynamical interaction with and without enhanced vertical mixing in fig 9 d δsalt of no wav cpl and cpl tke is calculated by subtracting surface salinity from bottom salinity a significant reduction in the plume spatial extent for cpl tke in comparison with cpl and no wav is visible we also noted that cpl tke resulted in less δsalt i e stratification with a smoother gradient around the plume front region see section 5 4 for further discussion we identify similar features in fig 9 e where the vertical δu parameter for no wav cpl and cpl tke cases is determined by subtracting bottom velocity from surface velocity significant reduction in vertical shear due to enhanced vertical mixing in cpl tke case is also presented in fig 9 g water surface elevation differences determined by subtracting cpl and cpl tke elevation from no wav corresponding values are presented a general positive difference of about 1 cm for both cases is a sign of a barotropic pressure gradient induced by momentum released from dissipating waves as they propagate towards shoreline there is a sharp decrease in water surface elevation for both coupled cases due to wave set down right around the plume front where enhanced surface dissipation of incident waves at the front is noticeable for cpl at x 1750 m and for cpl tke at x 1450 m it should be noted that here we are discussing a time snapshot of a process which essentially evolves over the time in the cpl tke case wave dissipation is treated as an injection of tke at the ocean surface it causes a significant enhancement in vertical mixing at the plume front as well as inside of the plume region as it spreads and expands in time enhanced vertical mixing reduces vertical shear and stratification this results in reduction of the gradient of opposing current in the plume region which reduces the wave shoaling and makes wave dissipation less pronounced and therefore reduces wave forcing terms in ocean circulation momentum equations 5 3 effects of wave current interaction on horizontal advection here we investigate effects of net wave transport on advection of an expanding plume by examining various components of horizontal salt advection terms the advecting velocity in the wave averaged naiver stokes equations are defined by u l u u s t where ul is the total velocity or lagrangian velocity u is the mean current eulerian velocity and ust is the wave related net velocity stokes drift we decomposed the horizontal salt advection into its two original components by u s x and u s t s x terms fig 11 the wave related stokes drift transport term in x direction u momentum acts primarily against mean current eulerian transport figs 11 a e f i and j in the positive y side of the expanding plume wave related advection term results in reducing horizontal advection of salt towards open ocean therefore it counts as a yet another reason for why plume expansion is slower towards open ocean for coupled cases in comparison with no wav however in the very end of the plume wake e g x 1000 m and y 2400 m in figs 11 e and f the wave related term increases the magnitude of the eulerian advection that has the tendency of returning the freshwater plume towards the shoreline the stokes drift advection term in y direction v momentum works mostly in agreement with the eulerian salt advection term specifically around the ocean side of the plume front above y 200 m which results in magnifying salt advection in y direction figs 11 c g k and l therefore we can identify wave related stokes transport as one of the mechanisms contributing to the modification of plume expansion rates however this mechanism acts differently in x and y directions it generally slows down the plume expansion in comparison with no wav in x direction and promotes it in y direction the overall results of this mechanism for this specific situation is to push the plume landwards and elongate it parallel to the shoreline in other words the stokes transport creates a dynamic barrier that inhibits the plume s offshore expansion the plume still has to expand so it deepens and expands further in the alongshore direction for another example on how wave induced net transport advects the columbia river plume see akan et al 2017 5 4 effects of wave current interaction on vertical mixing to investigate the effects of wave current interaction in terms of energy transfer from breaking waves to ocean water column in the form of tke a vertical transect at y 1700 m for salinity tke and turbulent vertical salt flux are shown in fig 12 we also overlaid the vertical velocity vector field on salinity cross section plots fig 12 a c a sharp and strong downwelling at the plume front and general upwelling landwards of the front are visible in all cases no wav and cpl manifest stronger downwelling and upwelling in this region cpl tke represents deeper downwelling of the freshwater its front also stays closer to the shore and it is thicker uniform and more mixed which are signs of the effects of enhanced exchange and vertical mixing due to inclusion of the wave dissipation in the vertical mixing parametrization profiles of tke for no wav cpl and cpl tke are presented in fig 12 d f taking into account the energy dissipated from breaking waves as a surface flux boundary condition for the turbulence model resulted in enhancement of tke close to the surface for the cpl tke case in comparison with other cases in all the cases we see a tke enhancement at the plume front and at the region where the plume becomes bottom attached closer to the shoreline due to turbulent shear production in these regions profiles of the turbulent vertical salt fluxes k d s d y for no wav cpl and cpl tke are presented in fig 12 g i the salt flux is positive for all cases the heavier ocean saltwater is mixing upwards with light freshwater at the surface by turbulent mixing activity and other physical processes we see greater and more concentrated salt fluxes close to the surface for no wav and cpl cases however the enhanced vertical mixing in cpl tke stretched the region of elevated turbulent salt flux over almost the entire water column to further investigate the effects of wave current interaction on the vertical and horizontal structure of the expanding freshwater plume a vertical transect at y 0 m on may 18 2012 6 30 utc for salinity tke and turbulent vertical salt flux are shown in fig 13 for all three cases presented in fig 13 lift off regions are located at x 850 m however the plume extent for no wav without wave cpl wave momentum exchange and cpl tke extended to x 1750 m x 1600 m and x 1450 m respectively fig 13 a c for this transect cpl and no wav salinity fields in the freshwater plume region are comparable however cpl tke represents a pronounced change in freshwater advection downwards at the plume front and returning saline ocean water upward landward of the front the enhanced vertical advection is also collocated with enhanced salinity turbulent vertical flux fig 13 i 6 conclusion in this research for the first time we validated a realistic full three dimensional ocean wave coupled model for the new river estuarine system which includes detailed atmospheric forcing freshwater inflow and time dependent temperature and salinity at the ocean boundary condition as opposed to systems like the columbia river mouth in which out going momentum flux of the ebb tidal plume is several orders of magnitude larger than the momentum flux input by the waves we showed that the new river inlet is an ideal system to study the wave current plume interaction because the energy and momentum exchange of the out going tidal jet and incoming waves are in a comparable order of magnitude we employed the modeling system to investigate the validity of the hypotheses on the mechanisms in which surface gravity waves and expanding freshwater plume interacts our modeling results confirm our hypotheses concerning mechanics of forces applied by incoming waves due to various wave current interaction mechanisms in particular we showed that wave momentum released by incoming waves via various conservative i e stokes drift and non conservative i e breaking waves slows down the outgoing freshwater ebb plume confine it to the shoreline and prevent the plume from expanding freely towards the open ocean tke injection at the plume front and inside the plume region results in deepening the plume and reducing the horizontal velocity gradient it also increases the plume front width less sharp plume edge reduction in the horizontal velocity gradient at the plume region and plume front results in reduction of wave shoaling and its steepness wave breaking and amount of tke injection wave current interaction at the plume region and its front as well as its feedback to both wave and current field are intense and interrelated failing to include these processes in the modeling will result in magnification of the wave shoaling and breaking as well as a sharper plume edge which may affect other interested processes such as bio geo chemistry pollution and sediment transport and fate processes wave dissipation due to opposing current implemented in swan wave model is calibrated for a limited range of opposing velocities however for settings like the mouth of the columbia river where extreme opposing current velocities reaches to 3 ms 1 there is a need to check the validity and suggest required modifications taking into account freshwater inflow specifically for modeling studies related to biogeochemistry or morphological studies for similar inlet systems is strongly suggested

24059,in this research a three dimensional coupled wave circulation model including meteorological forcing freshwater inflow and time varying open boundary conditions for new river inlet is validated a mechanistic approach is taken to investigate how various wave current interaction mechanisms affect the nearshore circulation plume expansion and surface wave field in the plume region of a relatively small partially mixed tidal estuarine system more specifically focus is comparing four different modeling cases including 1 a three dimensional ocean circulation model no wave effects 2 a coupled wave circulation model 3 a coupled wave and circulation model including vertical mixing enhancement due to wave breaking and 4 a wave model without surface current effects findings reveal forces are applied by incoming waves due to various wave current interaction mechanisms wave momentum released by incoming waves pushes the outgoing freshwater ebb plume back to the shoreline and prevents the plume from expanding freely towards the open ocean findings also reveals that releasing wave dissipated energy in the expanding plume region enhances vertical mixing mixes down freshwater and therefore thickens the plume these results are congruent with observations at the mouth of the columbia river keywords wave current interaction tidal inlet river plume wind waves three dimensional circulation wave breaking 1 introduction dynamical interaction of the surface gravity waves and stratified flows is not well understood nearshore incident gravity waves encounter relatively strong opposing currents at the edge of an expanding freshwater plume thomson et al 2014 these strong opposing currents in most cases super critical flow make waves that experience rapid changes including shoaling refraction convergence and breaking particularly short period surface waves steepen and become physically unstable e g breaking and blocking at the edge and inside of the plume region akan et al 2017 2018 the wave breaking starts from the high frequency part of the wave spectrum and extracts energy and momentum from surface waves in other words the high speed opposing current at the edge and at the surface of the plume region acts like a low pass filter which lets only the lower frequency part of the surface wave spectrum e g swells to pass the plume region and reach to the shoreline or the tidal inlet entrance area the extracted energy and momentum affect nearshore three dimensional circulation considerably gerbi et al 2013 moghimi et al 2016 this process results in significant enhancement in the position size shape and other characteristics of the expanding tidal freshwater plume and modifies incident wave field features recent field observations at the columbia river showed that incoming short period gravity waves which are experiencing a super critical opposing current at the plume front break and lose significant amounts of energy and momentum at the plume region thomson et al 2014 compared observations from two days with similar tidal forcing and river discharge but with different wave conditions this demonstrated that the plume thickness and its extent differs between the two cases substantially it was speculated that the injected energy due to wave breaking enhances turbulence quantities and vertical mixing and therefore is the main mechanism for the very different plume thickness demonstrated during these two days this hypothesis is not yet fully validated in a realistic modeling study akan et al 2017 employed a coupled wave and three dimensional ocean circulation model to study wave current interaction at the columbia river freshwater plume the study showed how various mechanisms for exchanging momentum between incoming surface gravity waves and expanding large freshwater plumes affect plume and wave characteristics however the role of extracted energy from breaking waves in vertical mixing enhancement and its effects on the expanding freshwater plume characteristics were not investigated moghimi et al 2016 performed a series of modeling experiments using a two equation turbulence closure model to provide a quantitative description of the effects of energy released by surface breaking waves and to identify the relationship with turbulence kinetic dissipation rates inside the water column at the new river inlet nc their modeling system similar to the common coupled wave and three dimensional coastal ocean circulation models checked the consistency and applicability of state of the art coupled modeling systems in terms of energy exchange between surface waves and the ocean water columns using a one dimensional vertical water column turbulence model they suggested use of a vertical mixing parametrization to relate dissipated energy from surface breaking waves to vertical distribution of turbulent dissipation rates inside the wave affected part of the water column three times the significant wave heights from the ocean surface one of the primary objectives for this current study is to investigate the mechanism of turbulent kinetic energy tke injection from the surface wave field and to study its role in enhancing vertical mixing and modifying plume physical features new river inlet nc was the site of an intensive observation campaign during april june 2012 several modeling methods and observational research were utilized to study various aspect of tidal circulation wave current interaction sediment transport morphology lagrangian drifters dispersion and dye release transport chen et al 2015 spydell et al 2015 feddersen et al 2016 olabarrieta et al 2014 however to the best of our knowledge in all conducted modeling studies the new river inlet was considered as a well mixed shallow inlet without considering river and catchment area freshwater inflow and precipitation effects feddersen et al 2016 recently presented a dye release study based on modeling and in situ observation for the same measurement campaign although the modeling study was done assuming the well mixed inlet system i e no stratification the authors stated the importance of investigating the wave effects on tidal inlet flow in a full three dimensional ocean circulation setting based on the vertical salinity observation presented in their study and discharge information available for new river we identified a direct connection between precipitation events and vertical salinity gradient i e formation of ebb tidal freshwater plume for example the stratified freshwater plume reported in this paper for may 18 2012 is a consequence of a relatively minor precipitation event for may 17 2012 fig 1 looking at the frequency of the rain events with similar or more severe precipitation reveals that during the year 2012 more than 60 events with similar or larger river inflow were observed fig 2 therefore it is necessary to apply a full three dimensional model for new river estuary as a partially mixed tidal system to address questions concerning processes such as sediment and pollution transport morphology or biogeochemical activities in the new river inlet the energy and momentum exchange of out going tidal jet and incoming waves are of the same comparable order of magnitude this makes new river inlet an ideal system to study the wave current plume interaction as opposed to the systems like the columbia river where the out going momentum flux from the tidal plume is several orders of magnitude larger than the momentum flux input by the waves therefore vertical mixing enhancement due to inclusion of surface flux of energy from wave dissipation and wave momentum exchange show a considerable impact on the freshwater plume characteristics e g volume and location in a tidal cycle time scale the purpose of this paper is twofold first we present a three dimensional coupled ocean circulation and wave model for the new river estuary system covering from river to ocean this is the first time that a three dimensional coupled circulation model including meteorological forcing freshwater inflow and time varying open boundary conditions for the new river inlet is validated and becomes available to the scientific community this is especially important because of the very rich oceanographic data sets which are still being used in various on going research activities secondly we also take a mechanistic approach to investigate how various wave current interaction mechanisms affect the nearshore circulation plume expansion and surface wave field in the plume region of a relatively small partially mixed tidal estuarine system more specifically we concentrate on comparing four different modeling cases including 1 three dimensional ocean circulation model no wave effects 2 coupled wave circulation model 3 coupled wave and circulation model including vertical mixing enhancement due to wave breaking and 4 wave model without surface current effects the organization of this paper is as follows section 2 describes the circulation wave and turbulence models sections 3 1 and 3 2 presents model set up and validation of the results against the observation sections 3 3 and 4 describe modeling experiments design and results section 5 provides discussions over various aspects of wave current interaction and its dynamical effects on waves and freshwater plume section 6 concludes the paper with a summary of the main findings and outlooks 2 methods 2 1 the model system we carried out numerical experiments for this study using the coawst coupled model system developed by warner et al 2008 it should be noted that the role of the atmospheric subsystem as a model component in the coupled application is not considered the atmospheric information were treated as the input data i e external forcing read by wave and ocean circulation components in terms of wave forcing in the governing equation of the ocean circulation model we employed an implementation of vortex force vf formalism by kumar et al 2012 following mcwilliams et al 2004 and uchiyama et al 2010 we utilized the three dimensional coastal ocean model roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 and the third generation wind wave model swan booij et al 1999 as our main modeling components for this study roms is a three dimensional free surface terrain following system which is designed to solve the primitive nonlinear hydrostatic equations with the boussinesq assumption the wave averaged momentum equation reads as 1 u t u u w u z f z u φ f d z u w ν u z k j

terms j k is the vortex force and k is the lower order bernoulli head as described in mcwilliams et al 2004 fw is the non conservative wave forces an overbar indicates time average and a prime indicates turbulent fluctuating quantity see kumar et al 2012 for implementation details swan is a phase averaged wave model that solves the wave action balance equation to predict the evolution of frequency directional wave spectra due to the effects of bathymetry water depth and ambient currents the model accounts for sources and sinks of wave action for each spectral component due to the effects of wind input white capping or depth induced wave breaking dissipation wave induced bottom drag dissipation and nonlinear triad or quadruplets interactions the effects of the tidal current and water level variation on the wave modeling results and wave forcing in ocean circulation were taken into account in a two way coupled fashion the governing equation for wave action balance komen et al 1994 n e ω wave θ ω wave reads as 4 n t x c g u n c ω wave n ω wave c θ n θ s tot ω wave where e defined as the wave energy at relative angular frequency ω wave propagating at an angle of θ c g is the intrinsic wave group velocity vector u is ambient current velocity vector and x is the horizontal geographic coordinate system the propagation velocities in spectral space ω wave θ are given by c ω wave and cθ the terms on the left hand side of the equation are responsible for local changes and propagation of the wave energy the right hand side of the equation represents source and sink terms

modifies its turbulence and mixing properties kitaigorodskii et al 1983 thorpe 1984 umlauf and burchard 2003 introduced a generic length scale two equation turbulence closure model which is also able to consider wave injected turbulence as a shear free production craig and banner 1994 burchard 2001 they suggested that the surface boundary condition for turbulent kinetic energy k could be approximated by a flux boundary condition 6 f k s ν turb σ k k z in which f k s is the flux of energy injected to the surface of the ocean due to surface wave dissipation here ν turb is the vertical eddy viscosity and σk is the turbulence schmidt number mellor and yamada 1982 z is the positive upward vertical coordinate the surface flux of tke f k s can be directly obtained from an ocean wave model in terms of computed surface wave dissipation terms jenkins 1989 by f k s wave β s s ds s where β s is a constant recent studies and inter comparison of the model results and available observations suggest that the k ω two equation turbulence closure model is well suited for wave enhanced turbulence and mixing studies for near shore and estuarine applications jones and monismith 2008 moghimi et al 2013 moghimi et al 2016 employed a high resolution k ω turbulence closure model and were able to fully resolve turbulence dissipation rate profiles close to the ocean surface they compared their model results with observations from surface wave instrument floats with tracking swifts in the nearshore region at new river inlet for the april june 2012 observation campaign thomson 2012 for the present study we employed k ω two equation turbulence closure model by setting the generic length scale turbulence closure model coefficients and stability function following carniel et al 2009 and kantha and clayson 2004 the turbulence model receives surface flux of tke and surface roughness from the wave model the surface flux of tke is a summation of all wave dissipation terms at the surface i e β s 1 and the surface roughness z 0 s is calculated as a fraction of the significant wave height h s by z 0 s 0 6 h s moghimi et al 2016 2 3 plume geometrical properties to evaluate and compare numerical experiments we defined some of the physical and geometrical properties of the freshwater plume gerbi et al 2013 the calculated parameters include freshwater plume centroid position plume surface area and plume average thickness we computed these parameters for the freshwater plume exited from the inlet entrance towards ocean at x 0 m we defined the freshwater plume as the water less saline than 35 2 psu then we calculated the plume centroid and plume average thickness from the freshwater concentration parameter defined by gerbi et al 2013 as 7 f s 0 s s 0 where s is salinity and s 0 35 2 the x and z centroid are defined as 8 x v x f d v v f d v 9 z v z f d v v f d v where v is the total volume of the freshwater plume x and z are the local coordinate of each freshwater parcel dv we computed the average plume thickness by dividing the total volume v to the plume surface area sp 3 numerical modeling 3 1 model set up the new river estuary nre is located in southeastern north carolina in the united states it connects the new river to the atlantic ocean via the new river inlet see blue rectangle in fig 3 a this is a relatively shallow estuary system with mean depth of 2 m at the entrance it consists of two channels the main channel is maintained in a specific range of depths by dredging for marine transportation purposes with a maximum depth of about 10 m the maximum tidal range at the entrance is less than 2 m and waves greater than 1 5 m approach the inlet entrance area in storm conditions the water depth increases to about 15 m within 5 km from the shoreline towards open ocean we constructed our models bathymetry by combining historical data and recent surveys at the new river inlet entrance region the numerical models bathymetry for both regional and local cases red and blue rectangles in fig 3 b are mainly based on a u s army corps of engineers survey in august 2010 we also updated the inlet entrance region by their survey conducted on may 10 2012 due to the importance of the complicated tidal channel system in circulation of the new river estuary and its inlet region macmahan et al 2014 we used aerial information from the google earth database to reconstruct the tidal channels in some areas without direct bathymetrical information primarily for the regional circulation model the model grid contains two levels of nested domains with increasing horizontal resolution to resolve the detailed physical processes in the ocean side and bay side of the inlet entrance specification of the model parameters for each grid are presented in table 1 the regional grid red rectangle in fig 3 encompasses the estuary and extends offshore onto the continental shelf to water depths of 30 m the local grid blue rectangle in fig 3 has a relatively fine resolution extending about 9 km out onto the continental shelf to water depths of about 14 m the local cartesian coordinate system x y is introduced where x is directed toward offshore and y directed alongshore respectively fig 4 we initialized the regional grid using navy coastal ocean model ncom salinity and temperature in the ocean side and linearly interpolated salinity from the shoreline to 15 psu towards land at the end of the computational grid based on available limited observations koroknay 2012 we spun up the circulation model for the regional grid for three months based on estimated flushing time of 64 days for the new river estuary ensign et al 2004 we forced the regional circulation model by the main 8 tidal constituents using oregon state university tidal inversion software otps egbert and erofeeva 2002 which applies tidal elevation and depth averaged velocities at the open boundaries we applied the non tidal forcing at the open boundary by interpolating non tidal water elevation from three hourly ncom results we did not apply non tidal velocities at the boundary which might have some effects in the vicinity of the regional coarse model boundary however since the local fine model boundary is far from the coarse grid boundary we believe that the local model solution is not affected we constructed temperature and salinity boundary conditions from three hourly three dimensional ncom outputs for the regional model we ran the standalone circulation model of the regional grid for the whole simulation period including spin up and the observation period then we extracted required initial and boundary conditions for the local grid blue grid in fig 3 which were used to execute standalone and coupled cases we did not include the first couple of hours of our simulations in our analysis considering initial adjustment moving from a coarse to a fine resolution we reduced this transition time by using non uniform grid sizes in a way that the grid sizes of the coarse and the fine grids around the boundary of the local set up fine became comparable based on available observations a moderate rain event triggers a noticeable freshwater ebb plume that will be mixed away in a couple of tidal cycles fig 1 apart from the direct precipitation at the surface of the estuary the main source of the fresh water is the new river and some other tributaries which are also mainly driven by direct run off at each rain event we used the usgs observation station at gum branch jacksonville as a reference for the new river discharge due to limited discharge measurements for other tributaries inflow to the system and the fact that most of the fresh water inflow is directly triggered by precipitation run off we assumed that their discharge specifications are similar to the new river therefore we scaled the discharge for the 6 major tributaries based on limited available discharge measurements koroknay 2012 we imposed the meteorological forcing as a combination of the national centers for environmental prediction ncep north american regional reanalysis narr and in situ measurements during the entire simulation period we forced a spatially constant and time variable forcing when the in situ measurements were available mainly for the month of may 2012 we also reduced narr short wave radiation for an average bias of 15 based on comparing available in situ measurements during may 2012 we used narr precipitation information over the new river system for the whole simulation period we forced the wave model local grid by spectral boundary conditions derived from noaa buoy station 41012 located at 30 042n 80 534w the spectra were discretized into 55 frequency and 90 direction bins we extended frequency axes to cover 0 025 to 2 5 hz to resolve the wave dissipation in high frequency tail of the wave spectrum following moghimi et al 2016 where hz is the number of cycles per second the wave model was forced by the same wind as the circulation model and was executed in the third generation mode for other wave model physical parameters we employed white capping dissipation by van der westhuysen et al 2007 bottom dissipation by hasselmann et al 1973 wind input yan 1987 3 2 validation the new river inlet was the site of an intensive observation campaign in april june 2012 as a part of the data assimilation and remote sensing for littoral application darla project jessup et al 2011 and rivet i riverine and estuarine transport experiment supported by the office of naval research observations include in situ meteorology wave buoys bottom mounted pressure gauges current velocity water column temperature and salinity as well as airborne and tower based video infrared and radar remote sensing see fig 4 during the observation period there was a rain event on may 17 2012 that triggered a freshwater plume formation at the new river inlet to be able to investigate this event we conducted our coupled modeling experiments from 14 to 19 of may 2012 we defined our base model as the coupled roms and swan model hereafter cpl which was forced by realistic meteorology tide and wave boundary conditions we employed available observations from in situ measurement stations fig 1 to validate our base model results wind speed and direction from the meteorological pile are shown in fig 1 a from 14 to 19 may 2012 we encountered two different wind conditions with the similar average wind speed of 6 m s 1 however the wind direction changed almost 180 from an onshore directed to an offshore directed wind system in this paper we will primarily focus on the two ebb events occurring during may 18 2012 where the offshore directed wind prevails the hourly mean discharge of the new river at the usgs station located at gum jacksonville nc is shown in fig 1 c due to a rain event a sudden increase in the discharge from 1 to 5 m3s 1 on may 17 2012 is observable we also plotted the frequency histogram of the hourly mean discharge of new river for the whole 2012 period in fig 2 there are more than 60 rain fall events with discharge greater than 5 m3s 1 the significant wave height comparison between the wave model and in situ measurement at wave buoy see fig 4 for buoy location is presented in fig 1 e and f the modeled and observed time series of significant wave height show small bias and rms errors comparison between the water surface elevation from the coupled model and the bottom mounted pressure gauge see fig 4 for the sensor location is shown in fig 1 g and h the modeled and observed time series of water surface elevation are well correlated and represent very small bias and rms errors the surface and bottom salinity at the wire walker fig 4 for the sensor location are given in fig 1 i i j k and l the fresh water inflow event on may 17 2012 resulted in generation of a freshwater plume that is captured in both the model and in observation of surface and bottom salinity it should be noted that the wire walker provided the whole water column salinity and temperature however here we averaged the first and last half meter of the water column to calculate surface and bottom salinity and temperature observations then we compared the interpolated model values with the resulted observations given the difficulties for constructing the freshwater forcing files we think that the model and data comparison specifically for the surface salinity with bias and rms errors of less than 0 2 psu is in acceptable range however the model still missed the freshwater inflow event at 1800 may 17 2012 since there was not a significant variability in water column temperature based on wirewalker observation we will only concentrate on salinity differences as the main driver for the observed and modeled density variations given that fact the contribution of extreme events in processes like sediment transport are significant 3 3 experimental design in this section we defined the numerical experiments that we used to test our hypotheses on the mechanisms in which surface gravity waves and inlet hydraulics interacts and leads to modifying physical characteristics of an expanding freshwater plume as well as incident surface gravity waves our main hypotheses are strong opposing surface currents in an expanding plume region cause incident surface waves to steepen and become physically unstable and break this results in enhancing wave breaking and extracting energy and momentum from waves and therefore injection of a substantial amount of energy and momentum into the water column momentum injected during wave breaking and shoaling in plume region exerts forces against plume expansion and confines the plume to the inlet entrance area energy injected during wave breaking enhances turbulence and vertical mixing and reduces plume surface signature and increases plume thickness our numerical experiments to test these hypotheses includes four model runs for the new river inlet local set up as no wav a standalone ocean circulation model results without wave effects cpl a coupled wave and ocean circulation model in this case a two way dynamical coupling is employed in which the wave model provides the wave forcing terms to the ocean circulation and the ocean circulation model provides water surface elevation and current field to the wave model however effects of injected energy due to surface wave breaking on enhancing vertical mixing is not included cpl tke similar to the cpl case plus the ocean circulation model also receives wave dissipation at the surface as a source of tke to force its turbulence closure model for enhancing vertical mixing due to energy injection from surface breaking waves no cur wave model simulation including water level variation however not including surface current we initialized all simulations with the same initial condition on may 17 2012 at 01 00 utc extracted from the realistic coupled simulation cpl explained in section 3 2 and compared the simulations results during may 18 2012 to make the wave effects more pronounced while maintaining the results as a realistic simulation we applied a constant in time and spatially variable wave boundary conditions of may 15 2012 1200 utc for the simulation period with significant wave height of 1 3 m see green vector fig 5 d 4 results comparison of the modeled salinity for vertical transects at y 1700 m transect b in fig 4 and sea surface salinity for a snapshot of the departing freshwater plume on may 18 2012 6 30 utc reveals the significance of inclusion of wave forcing mechanisms on the extent and vertical distribution of the plume structure fig 5 plume extent for no wav without wave solution extended to x 2200 m fig 5 a and b and for cpl wave momentum exchange decreased to x 1700 m fig 5 c d however the plume extent for cpl tke which has both wave momentum and energy exchange vertical mixing enhancement included shows a significant reduction in its surface signature and its plume extent reaches to x 1400 m fig 5 e f cpl results show a slightly thicker freshwater plume around the front in comparison with no wav as it clearly pushed towards the shoreline because of momentum exchange with the incident wave however for cpl tke the enhanced downward wave related mixing show a pronounced change in plume extent as freshwater mixed downwards and the vertical salinity gradient reduced significantly both in the ocean and the land side of the plume region comparing surface salinity at the entrance region inside the mouth for cpl and cpl tke cases shows that the enhanced mixing at the front and plume region result in more saline surface current and less horizontal and vertical stratification even inside the estuary based on the distance perpendicular to the shore line from x 0 m along the transect at y 1700 m transect b in fig 4 and also assuming cpl as the base run we can deduce that not considering wave momentum exchange no wav increases the maximum extent of the freshwater plume by more than 20 furthermore inclusion of wave dissipation in turbulence closure reduces the plume maximum extent by 20 for this specific transect therefore both vertical salinity profiles and surface snapshots for the above mentioned cases confirm our hypotheses to further investigate our hypotheses and examine the differences in a quantitative manner we present the time evolution of the plume geometrical properties for the above mentioned cases fig 6 here x is the cross shore distance of the position of the freshwater plume centroid in the local coordinate system fig 4 z is the positive upward vertical coordinate with zero at the mean sea level we compared two ebb events on may 18 2012 6 30 utc dashed line and may 18 2012 18 30 utc solid line in fig 6 on may 18 2012 6 30 utc the plume centroid for no wav goes out towards open ocean for both peak ebb cases up to x max 900 m however these values for both coupled cases show that the fresh water plume did not go that far x max 800 m fig 6 a for the second ebb event on may 18 2012 18 30 utc a clear distinction between three cases is visible for this ebb no wav cpl and cpl tke plume centroid goes towards the ocean for x max 900 m x max 800 m and x max 750 m respectively fig 6 a the vertical position of the freshwater plume centroid for both ebb situations shows similar results for both ebb situations no wav freshwater plume is more concentrated towards the surface and cpl tke plume is more distributed inside the water column therefore the plume centroid for the cpl tke run is deeper compared to the other cases which suggests increased vertical mixing in the cpl tke case fig 6 b comparison of the freshwater plume surface reveals that no wav generates the largest and cpl tke produced the smallest plume surface area fig 6 c using freshwater plume volume and surface we can compute an estimate of plume thickness where no wav shows the thinnest thickness 1 3 m and cpl tke presents the thickest plume thickness 2 1 m this results in a reduction of the surface area of the freshwater plume by considering wave effects in both mixing and momentum equations figs 6 d 5 b d and f our modeling results confirm our hypotheses concerning mechanics of forces applied by incoming waves due to various wave current interaction mechanisms wave momentum released by incoming waves pushes the outgoing freshwater ebb plume back to the shoreline and prevent the plume from expanding freely towards the open ocean it also reveals that releasing wave dissipated energy in the expanding plume region enhances vertical mixing mixes down freshwater and therefore thickens the plume these results are in agreement with thomson et al 2014 observations at the mouth of the columbia river to further discuss and quantify the role of each of the various wave current interaction mechanisms we examined some aspects of these processes in the following section 5 discussion 5 1 plume extent evolution in time here we investigate the time dependent dynamics of the wave current interaction effects on an expanding freshwater plume using the hovmoller diagrams of the relative surface divergence nondimensionalized surface divergence by the coriolis frequency relative divergence is plotted at transect a at x 1500 m parallel to the shoreline in the ocean side of the inlet entrance and transect b at y 1700 m perpendicular to the shoreline figs 7 and 8 location shown in fig 4 surface divergence is an indicator of the plume front location that can be calculated when the three dimensional velocity field is available at the front a strong down welling current causes a convergence zone and hence a negative divergence therefore in the above mentioned figures the negative divergence regions in blue represent the plume front location fig 7represents the width of the plume passes in time through the transect a during the first ebb on may 18 2012 the plume maximum width of no wav is about 5 km cpl is 3 6 km and cpl tke is about 2 5 km in this specific ebb situation and because of the wind condition the plume turns to the negative x direction since y 0 m is right in front of the entrance were the powerful ebb jet enters the ocean for almost all of the cases the plume reaches to transect a at t 5 h however the plume front of no wav stayed beyond x 1500 m for a long time and advected towards negative y eventually it returns closer to the shoreline however the plume front of cpl tke returns sooner also there is a noticeable difference between no wav and cpl which is more obvious in the second ebb event return of the plume front happens slower than the cpl case as an index of how wave forcing could affect plume front location and its dynamics fig 8represents the extent of the plume front towards open ocean along the transect b in time during may 18 2012 the plume extent of cpl tke is the smallest along the transect b in comparison with two other cases we calculated the front propagation speed for the first ebb frontal feature starting from x 1500 m around time 5 hour based on our calculation the front propagation speed for no wav is about 190 m h cpl is about 140 m h and cpl tke is about 110 m h for this specific transect x 1500 2500 the propagation velocity reduced by a factor of two from no wav to cpl tke plume front of no wav cpl and cpl tke cases reach their maximum distance from the entrance in 10 8 5 and 7 h brando et al 2015 compared remotely sensed sea surface temperature and results from a wave atmosphere and ocean coupled modeling system cowast they achieved a qualitative agreement between their modeling results and sea surface temperature from remote sensing device at sub mesoscale and mesoscale for some of the major rivers plume in another study we employed a coupled wave and ocean circulation model with higher spatial resolution nested inside the current local model for the new river inlet we see that surface divergence of cpl case with realistic wave forcing qualitatively matches back scatter pattern in terasar ortiz suslow et al 2015 image spatially and temporally we also did some comparisons between one minute averaged x band radar díaz méndez et al 2015 back scatter and surface divergence of model results and see qualitative match not shown here 5 2 wave current interaction and plume extent in space to demonstrate how wave current interaction modifies plume spatial extent and wave field properties we compared results of the cases at the transect b located at y 1700 m shown in fig 4 on may 18 2012 6 30 utc fig 9 we define the freshwater plume region where the δsalt bottom and surface salinity differences parameter fig 9 d presents significant difference between bottom and surface salinity for this specific transect on may 18 2012 6 30 utc the local x coordinate of the approximate plume lift off and front are given in table 2 wave height evolution for both coupled cases cpl and cpl tke and wave model without current effects no cur are shown in fig 9 a we also plotted the differences between wave height and its running mean to magnify their changes around the plume front the wave height is decreasing while propagating towards shoreline the main dissipation process before the waves encounter the plume is the bottom dissipation the δhsig line plots for cpl and cpl tke cases show a clear wave shoaling due to strong opposing current at the edge of the plume fronts x1700 m and x1300 m for cpl and cpl tke respectively this is followed by an enhancement in surface wave dissipation and a reduction of wave height at the front position fig 9 b surface waves after passing the front and entering into the plume region still experience an opposing current as well as reduction in water depth which reflects in wave height by a slight shoaling and further wave dissipation these effects are observable in both coupled cases results in the wave only case no cur the wave height decays with the same slope parallel to the coupled cases however excluding the opposing current from this simulation resulted in reducing wave dissipation and therefore greater significant wave height obviously the δhsig line plot for the wave only case no cur does not show any sign of the plume front location evolution of wave spectrum for waves traveling across the plume front and finally arriving at the shallow regions where depth induced breaking actively drains wave energy is presented in fig 10 the energy difference between point p09 to p68 represents both bottom dissipation and surface dissipation due to opposing current induced wave breaking at the plume front and inside the plume region wave surface dissipation for cpl and cpl tke are shown in fig 9 b we also added the differences between wave surface dissipation and its running mean to magnify their changes around the plume front noticeable increases in wave surface dissipation are shown for both coupled cases where the incoming wave meets the expanding plume fronts of cpl and cpl tke at x 1700 m and x 1400 m respectively as it is explained by moghimi et al 2016 wave dissipation due to opposing current implemented in swan wave model by van der westhuysen et al 2007 considers this effect and is calibrated for a limited range of opposing velocities applicable to the new river inlet case however for settings like the mouth of the columbia river where extreme opposing current velocities reaches to 3 ms 1 needs to be validated and require consideration of modifications with an explanation of the findings the sum of all wave averaged momentum terms including vertical j vortex force k vortex force and non conservative surface wave breaking terms as well as the total acceleration for all of the cases are shown in fig 9 c see eq 1 here we observe peaks in wave momentum that coincide with the enhanced wave dissipation regions at the plume front for both coupled cases fig 9 b however the raise in cpl is sharper and more pronounced and follows the same pattern as the horizontal gradient in δsalt bottom and surface salinity differences and δu surface and bottom velocity velocity shown in fig 9 d and e incraesed wave momentum against the exiting ebb jet results in reduction of total acceleration the wave force essentially pushes the plume back to the inlet entrance region and will not let it expand freely towards open ocean the same pattern for both cpl and cpl tke cases can be seen however they are different in terms of location and horizontal gradient which also relate back to wave current dynamical interaction with and without enhanced vertical mixing in fig 9 d δsalt of no wav cpl and cpl tke is calculated by subtracting surface salinity from bottom salinity a significant reduction in the plume spatial extent for cpl tke in comparison with cpl and no wav is visible we also noted that cpl tke resulted in less δsalt i e stratification with a smoother gradient around the plume front region see section 5 4 for further discussion we identify similar features in fig 9 e where the vertical δu parameter for no wav cpl and cpl tke cases is determined by subtracting bottom velocity from surface velocity significant reduction in vertical shear due to enhanced vertical mixing in cpl tke case is also presented in fig 9 g water surface elevation differences determined by subtracting cpl and cpl tke elevation from no wav corresponding values are presented a general positive difference of about 1 cm for both cases is a sign of a barotropic pressure gradient induced by momentum released from dissipating waves as they propagate towards shoreline there is a sharp decrease in water surface elevation for both coupled cases due to wave set down right around the plume front where enhanced surface dissipation of incident waves at the front is noticeable for cpl at x 1750 m and for cpl tke at x 1450 m it should be noted that here we are discussing a time snapshot of a process which essentially evolves over the time in the cpl tke case wave dissipation is treated as an injection of tke at the ocean surface it causes a significant enhancement in vertical mixing at the plume front as well as inside of the plume region as it spreads and expands in time enhanced vertical mixing reduces vertical shear and stratification this results in reduction of the gradient of opposing current in the plume region which reduces the wave shoaling and makes wave dissipation less pronounced and therefore reduces wave forcing terms in ocean circulation momentum equations 5 3 effects of wave current interaction on horizontal advection here we investigate effects of net wave transport on advection of an expanding plume by examining various components of horizontal salt advection terms the advecting velocity in the wave averaged naiver stokes equations are defined by u l u u s t where ul is the total velocity or lagrangian velocity u is the mean current eulerian velocity and ust is the wave related net velocity stokes drift we decomposed the horizontal salt advection into its two original components by u s x and u s t s x terms fig 11 the wave related stokes drift transport term in x direction u momentum acts primarily against mean current eulerian transport figs 11 a e f i and j in the positive y side of the expanding plume wave related advection term results in reducing horizontal advection of salt towards open ocean therefore it counts as a yet another reason for why plume expansion is slower towards open ocean for coupled cases in comparison with no wav however in the very end of the plume wake e g x 1000 m and y 2400 m in figs 11 e and f the wave related term increases the magnitude of the eulerian advection that has the tendency of returning the freshwater plume towards the shoreline the stokes drift advection term in y direction v momentum works mostly in agreement with the eulerian salt advection term specifically around the ocean side of the plume front above y 200 m which results in magnifying salt advection in y direction figs 11 c g k and l therefore we can identify wave related stokes transport as one of the mechanisms contributing to the modification of plume expansion rates however this mechanism acts differently in x and y directions it generally slows down the plume expansion in comparison with no wav in x direction and promotes it in y direction the overall results of this mechanism for this specific situation is to push the plume landwards and elongate it parallel to the shoreline in other words the stokes transport creates a dynamic barrier that inhibits the plume s offshore expansion the plume still has to expand so it deepens and expands further in the alongshore direction for another example on how wave induced net transport advects the columbia river plume see akan et al 2017 5 4 effects of wave current interaction on vertical mixing to investigate the effects of wave current interaction in terms of energy transfer from breaking waves to ocean water column in the form of tke a vertical transect at y 1700 m for salinity tke and turbulent vertical salt flux are shown in fig 12 we also overlaid the vertical velocity vector field on salinity cross section plots fig 12 a c a sharp and strong downwelling at the plume front and general upwelling landwards of the front are visible in all cases no wav and cpl manifest stronger downwelling and upwelling in this region cpl tke represents deeper downwelling of the freshwater its front also stays closer to the shore and it is thicker uniform and more mixed which are signs of the effects of enhanced exchange and vertical mixing due to inclusion of the wave dissipation in the vertical mixing parametrization profiles of tke for no wav cpl and cpl tke are presented in fig 12 d f taking into account the energy dissipated from breaking waves as a surface flux boundary condition for the turbulence model resulted in enhancement of tke close to the surface for the cpl tke case in comparison with other cases in all the cases we see a tke enhancement at the plume front and at the region where the plume becomes bottom attached closer to the shoreline due to turbulent shear production in these regions profiles of the turbulent vertical salt fluxes k d s d y for no wav cpl and cpl tke are presented in fig 12 g i the salt flux is positive for all cases the heavier ocean saltwater is mixing upwards with light freshwater at the surface by turbulent mixing activity and other physical processes we see greater and more concentrated salt fluxes close to the surface for no wav and cpl cases however the enhanced vertical mixing in cpl tke stretched the region of elevated turbulent salt flux over almost the entire water column to further investigate the effects of wave current interaction on the vertical and horizontal structure of the expanding freshwater plume a vertical transect at y 0 m on may 18 2012 6 30 utc for salinity tke and turbulent vertical salt flux are shown in fig 13 for all three cases presented in fig 13 lift off regions are located at x 850 m however the plume extent for no wav without wave cpl wave momentum exchange and cpl tke extended to x 1750 m x 1600 m and x 1450 m respectively fig 13 a c for this transect cpl and no wav salinity fields in the freshwater plume region are comparable however cpl tke represents a pronounced change in freshwater advection downwards at the plume front and returning saline ocean water upward landward of the front the enhanced vertical advection is also collocated with enhanced salinity turbulent vertical flux fig 13 i 6 conclusion in this research for the first time we validated a realistic full three dimensional ocean wave coupled model for the new river estuarine system which includes detailed atmospheric forcing freshwater inflow and time dependent temperature and salinity at the ocean boundary condition as opposed to systems like the columbia river mouth in which out going momentum flux of the ebb tidal plume is several orders of magnitude larger than the momentum flux input by the waves we showed that the new river inlet is an ideal system to study the wave current plume interaction because the energy and momentum exchange of the out going tidal jet and incoming waves are in a comparable order of magnitude we employed the modeling system to investigate the validity of the hypotheses on the mechanisms in which surface gravity waves and expanding freshwater plume interacts our modeling results confirm our hypotheses concerning mechanics of forces applied by incoming waves due to various wave current interaction mechanisms in particular we showed that wave momentum released by incoming waves via various conservative i e stokes drift and non conservative i e breaking waves slows down the outgoing freshwater ebb plume confine it to the shoreline and prevent the plume from expanding freely towards the open ocean tke injection at the plume front and inside the plume region results in deepening the plume and reducing the horizontal velocity gradient it also increases the plume front width less sharp plume edge reduction in the horizontal velocity gradient at the plume region and plume front results in reduction of wave shoaling and its steepness wave breaking and amount of tke injection wave current interaction at the plume region and its front as well as its feedback to both wave and current field are intense and interrelated failing to include these processes in the modeling will result in magnification of the wave shoaling and breaking as well as a sharper plume edge which may affect other interested processes such as bio geo chemistry pollution and sediment transport and fate processes wave dissipation due to opposing current implemented in swan wave model is calibrated for a limited range of opposing velocities however for settings like the mouth of the columbia river where extreme opposing current velocities reaches to 3 ms 1 there is a need to check the validity and suggest required modifications taking into account freshwater inflow specifically for modeling studies related to biogeochemistry or morphological studies for similar inlet systems is strongly suggested
