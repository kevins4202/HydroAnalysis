micropollutants omps are largely discharged into the environment with wastewater in numerous forms these omps mostly signifies a wide spectrum of chemical used in pharmaceutical products which are consumed in various forms regularly samaras et al 2013 tijani et al 2013 rapid population growth industrialization and commercialization have further worsened this concern the demand for large volumes of clean water resources makes it necessary to remove these omps from wastewater by conventional treatment systems joss et al 2006 around the world according to the world health organization who approximately 750 million people not accessible to developed sources of drinking water unicef and who 2012 pharmaceutically active compounds phacs are commonly reported omps present in municipal wastewater streams lekkerkerker teunissen et al 2012 the presence of this phacs in aquatic environment gave rise to environmental issues and possible risk on human and nature xiu shengmiao et al 2005 even though in the aquatic environment phacs are present at low levels but its prolong participation may lead to toxic effect into the environment oetken et al 2005 feces and urine are the main sources of phacs and due to partial absorption of medicine by the body it gives out in unchanged as well as metabolites forms lam and mabury 2005 ternes 1998 in the present work carbamazepine cbz is taken in aqueous phases as a sedative drug cbz can give rise to severe toxicity in the emopoietic and liver system molinari et al 2006 this recalcitrant drug show comparatively high hydrophobicity in deionized water ojajuni et al 2016 furthermore being a psychoactive drug so it can potentially hamper the predator s escaping ability in fish keen et al 2012 apart from the continuous input of cbz into the aquatic environment this drug is also highly resistant to biodegradation and because it possesses low octanol water partition coefficient it is expected to remain in the aqueous phase aswaghosh et al 2016 from the literature it is studied that pharmaceutical drugs are sensitive to photodegradation in various experiment using sunlight uv lamps etc were performed for its removal from the wastewater young et al 2014 challis et al 2014 georgaki et al 2014 achilleos et al 2010 therefore various removal process such as adsorption photochemical process biological process and photodegradation process had been opted since past few years for the removal of this harmful drug baghdadi et al 2016 laurentiis et al 2012 kosjek et al 2009 haroune et al 2014 semiconductor nanoparticles such as zno tio2 had been used extensively for the photodegradation of cbz drug georgaki et al 2014 achilleos et al 2010 rutile type sno2 crystal is an n type semiconductor with a versatile wide band gap of 3 6 ev at 300 k derbal et al 2008 due to their excellent chemical stability optical and gas sensing properties these semiconductor metal oxide structures are extravagantly explored in the field of catalysis dye based solar cells transistors light emitting diodes gas sensors etc prakash et al 2016 carreño et al 2004 shang et al 2012 sberveglieri 1992 wang and chen 2009 li et al 2002 sno2 nanocrystals show an excellent photocatalytic activity in the presence of visible as well as uv lights elango and roopan 2016 therefore sno2 nps were widely employed as a photocatalyst in the degradation of harmful organic dyes srivastava and mukhopadhyay 2014 it is found that sno2 have a very low toxicity level as well as no significant carcinogenic properties and poorly absorbed by the body begum et al 2016a in recent years it is found show excellent response as an antibacterial as well as antioxidant agent vidhu and philip 2015 various other metal oxide semiconductor nanoparticles like tio2 ceo2 al2o3 have also been explored in various applications mora sero et al 2007 wang et al 2014 tzompantzi et al 2014 however the precursors for the synthesis of sno2 nanoparticles are of low cost and easy handling as compared to other metal oxides nanoparticles ibarguen et al 2007 numerous techniques like sol gel microwave spray pyrolysis hydrothermal and chemical precipitation route have been successfully used to synthesize nanoparticles begum et al 2016b muneer et al 2015 madhu et al 2013 efforts are made to develop a better synthetic route with the advantages of the simple and easy process with great purity controlled morphology and particle size distribution chemical homogeneity and low toxicity chemical precipitation method possess various advantages over other methods for the synthesis of different types of metal oxides nanoparticles as it provides high purity of product low cost good homogeneity and no organic solvents are needed in the process of synthesis and also more dispersed particles can be obtained nazari et al 2014 gaber et al 2014 therefore in the present work we have opted chemical precipitation method for the synthesis of sno2 nps additionally in chemical precipitation method annealing at high temperature is required so that the size of the nanoparticle can be modified according to their application gaber et al 2014 the size of the nanoparticles gets increased with increasing the annealing temperature in the synthesis of nanoparticles surfactant like cationic anionic and nonionic can acts as a stabilizing agent and it also plays a great role in controlling the size of the nanoparticles as well as it minimizes agglomerations pandey and dixit 2011 surfactants mostly are amphiphiles with hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups heinz et al 2017 these head groups actually prevent the agglomeration of the particles and also control their size it is found that surfactant molecules have also been employed as capping agents lee et al 2002 the surfactant molecules act as the hybrid building blocks for conversion into higher order structures by getting attached to the surface of nanoparticles li et al 1999 in the present work the role of cationic surfactant ctab and anionic surfactants sds in the synthesis of sno2 nanoparticles is investigated the effect of surfactants on the size and morphology of sno2 nanoparticles is also studied in the present study sno2 nanoparticles were synthesized by simple cost effective safe routes using cheap and non toxic reagents in order to control the size of the nanoparticles as well as it minimizes agglomerations cationic surfactant ctab and anionic surfactants sds were employed the effect on the synthesized sno2 nanoparticles with the annealing temperature is also investigated the synthesized sno2 nps were employed for the photodegradation of cbz drug under uv light to the best knowledge of the authors the photodegradation of the cbz drug by using sno2nps as a catalyst was performed for the first time 2 experimental 2 1 materials stannous chloride dehydrates sncl2 2h2o aspartic acid anhydrous cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and carbamazepines cbz were analytical grade and all were purchased from sigma aldrich double distilled water was used as a solvent in all the experiments 2 2 synthesis of sno2 nanoparticles photocatalyst sno2 nanoparticles were synthesized by a simple chemical precipitation method where 100 ml aqueous anhydrous aspartic acid solution 0 1 m was added to 100 ml 0 1 m sncl2 2h2o solution with continuous stirring to the solution mixture 10 ml 0 06 m ctab solution was added dropwise and was stirred for 3 h on a magnetic stirrer at 100 c then a light yellow precipitate so formed which was kept for 24 h to get matured then the resulting precipitate was washed with distilled water for several times to remove the impurities as well as excess surfactant and dried in an oven at 60 c for 12 h which results in a pale yellow powder this pale yellow powder was further annealed at two different temperatures i e 300 and 600 c and was marked sc1 and sc2 the same procedure was followed for the synthesis of sno2 nanoparticles using the aqueous aspartic acid solution sncl2 2h2o and sds as a surfactant it was also annealed at two different temperatures i e 300 and 600 c and marked as ss1 and ss2 the systematic scheme of the reaction is shown below scheme 1 2 3 characterization of synthesized sno2 nanoparticles to study the size morphology and diffraction ring of the so prepared sno2 nanoparticles before and after photodegradation of cbz were exemplified via tem transmission electron microscopy hrtem high resolution transmission electron microscopy and saed the selected area electron diffraction by using jem 2100 transmission electron further the synthesized sno2 nanocatalyst before and after photodegradation was illustrated by powder x ray diffraction xrd method using phillips x pert pro diffractometer with cu kα radiation of wavelength 1 5418 å uv visible spectra of the synthesized sno2 nanoparticles were recorded using genesys 10s uv vis spectrophotometer operational with quartz cell of path length 1 cm from wavelength between 200 nm and 400 nm at a speed of 600 nm min 1 infrared ft ir spectra were recorded in the wave number range from 400 to 4000 cm 1 by bruker hyperion 3000 ftir spectrometer the mass spectrometry was performed using liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer 410 prostar binary lc with 500 ms it pda detectors varian inc usa ionization was operated using an esi source in positive ion mode data acquisition was performed with bruker compass data analysis 4 1 2 4 setup of uv c light photoreactor in the present study the uv c light was used for the degradation of the cbz drug molecule fig 1 shows the setup of the uv c light photoreactor used in the degradation of cbz drug in this setup a stainless steel chamber with dimension of 45 cm 40 cm 45 cm inside the chamber a magnetic stirrer was kept and on the roof of the chamber there consist of three philips tuv 36 w uv c lamps of wavelength 254 nm which were set up in parallel the irradiance on the surface of solution mixture is 3 2 mw cm2 it is measured using lutron uvc 254 uv light meter by placing on the surface of the solution mixture which was kept 7 cm away from the uv c lamps the electric wiring of the uv c light and magnetic stirrer is connected to a switchboard outside the chamber the door of the chamber is kept in the front with lock system through which the sample can be kept inside to perform the experiment the drug solution along with the photocatalyst was kept in a borosil beaker with a magnetic needle the beaker was kept on the magnetic stirrer inside the chamber at a fixed position with a distance of 7 cm away from the lamps and the door was kept locked the switch of both the magnetic stirrer and uv light were kept on for the photoreaction process when withdrawing of the suspension is required both the switch of uv light and magnetic stirrer should be kept off before unlocking the door and then the beaker can be removed 2 5 photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine the photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine was performed by taking different experimental conditions under the uv c light the photocatalytic experiments were carried out by the dispersion of required amount 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 g l of both the synthesized sno2 nanoparticles i e sc1 and ss1 in 200 ml different concentrations i e 5 10 15 20 and 25 ppm of carbamazepine cbz solution respectively in two separate 500 ml borosil beaker and was kept for continuous stirring on a magnetic stirrer this solution mixture was kept in the dark under with continuous stirring for 1 h before uv irradiation for the adsorption desorption equilibrium the adsorption desorption study depicted in fig s1 of esi shows that a very minute percentage of the cbz was removed in presence of both the sc1 and ss1 nanoparticles respectively so removal of cbz due to adsorption can be neglected in this study for the analysis of the photocatalytic activity of the synthesized sno2 nanocatalyst the solution mixture of sno2 nps and cbz solution was kept under uv c light philips tuv 36 w uv c lamp with a continuous stirring condition at room temperature for 1 h a total of 2 ml of the solution mixture was withdrawn after every constant interval of time and then centrifuged the supernatant was monitored in a uv vis spectrophotometer genesys 10s uv vis spectrophotometer operational with 1 cm quartz cell to determine the concentration of cbz remaining in the solution mixture after every withdrawal a fresh solution mixture was set for photodegradation experiment and kept for irradiation for the required time for the accuracy of the results this procedure was continued until the maximum removal of cbz from aqueous solution was observed the same study was performed under uv light with a blank solution of cbz the blank solution of cbz was prepared by taking known concentrations i e 5 10 15 20 and 25 ppm of aqueous cbz solution without the addition of any photocatalysts and was kept under uv c light with the same conditions as that of photodegradation experiments carried out for cbz solution in presence of photocatalyst till maximum removal of cbz was attained here also the cbz solution was continuously monitored using uv vis spectrophotometer using the given equation percentage degradation of the cbz can be calculated 1 percentage efficiency c0 c c0 100 where co and c are the concentration of cbz in initial and at time t in min respectively here both in dark and blank study of the photodegradation showed almost negligible removal of cbz and no degradation of cbz respectively as shown in fig s1 of esi 2 6 reusability of the photocatalyst reusability of a catalyst is a very important factor to establish the durability of the catalyst therefore to evaluate the efficiency of sno2 nps a recyclability test was performed after completing the photodegradation process the used photocatalyst was recovered by centrifugation and was passed to whatman no 42 filter paper to collect the catalyst the obtained catalyst was washed several times with hot water and finally once with acetone and then dried in a hot air oven for 3 h at 60 c then the recovered catalyst was again used for the photodegradation of cbz solution and the percentage removal was noted using equation 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 tem hrtem and saed studies the synthesized sno2 nanoparticles nps synthesized by both the surfactant i e ctab and sds at different temperature were characterized by its tem images and saed patterns for size distribution and morphological study from the hrtem images of all the synthesized sno2 nps the microstructure is scrutinized the tem image fig 2 a of sc1 shows that particles are spherical in shape with an average size of 8 nm form the tem image particle size distribution histogram shown in fig 2d is also obtained which also illustrates that the average size diameter of sc1 nps is 8 nm from the hrtem images and saed patterns lattice fringes and diameter diffraction rings can be calculated therefore fig 2b depicts the hrtem image of sc1 which on the calculation of the lattice spacing shows 0 26 nm and 0 178 nm which are corresponding to 101 and 211 lattice plane of typical sno2 fig 2c shows the saed pattern of sc1which show bright concentric diffraction ring indicating it to be polycrystalline in nature from the diffraction ring it was also revealed that it goes well with the 110 101 200 211 and 301 plane of tetragonal rutile structure of sno2 jcpds 41 1445 fig 3 a displays the tem image of sno2 nanoparticles sc2 from which the size of the particles was found to be 13 5 nm it is also observed that the particles were well dispersed and the size of the particles is larger than the nanoparticles of sc1 the hrtem image i e fig 3b shows that the calculated lattice fringe is 0 176 which corresponds to 211 plane of sno2 fig 3c shows the saed patterns of sc2 which shows concentric circles indicating it to be polycrystalline in nature on the calculation of the d spacing from the diameter of the concentric circle of saed patterns it was found that all the planes match well with the standard sno2 again from the particle distribution histogram chart fig 3d shows that the average size of the sc2 nanoparticles was 13 5 nm from the tem image and the particle size distribution histogram of ss1 nps shown in fig 4 a and d discloses that the average size of the particles is 9 5 nm it also shows that it is well dispersed and spherical in shape the hrtem image shown in fig 4b gives two interplanar distances around 0 26 nm which can be assigned with the 101 diffraction planes of the tetragonal rutile structure of sno2 fig 4c represents the saed pattern recorded for ss1 nps the bright concentric diffraction rings of the saed patterns depicts that the ss1 nps are polycrystalline in nature and on calculation it shows that the d value corresponds to plane 110 101 200 and 211 of rutile structure of standard sno2 jcpds 41 1445 fig 5 a and d illustrate the tem image and particle size distribution histogram of ss2 nps it was found the average diameter of ss2 nps is 15 5 nm from the hrtem image given in the figure 5b shows that the lattice fringes of 0 23 nm which is attributed to 200 lattice plane of standard sno2 the saed patterns in fig 5c shows many concentric circles which attribute high polycrystallinity nature and on the calculation of d spacing from the diameter of the concentric circles it is found the all the plane 110 200 and 220 matches perfectly with the lattice plane of the tetragonal rutile crystal structure of sno2 jcpds 41 1445 3 2 xrd studies the xrd pattern of sno2 nps prepared using ctab sc1 and sc2 and sds ss1 and ss2 as surfactant is shown in fig 6 a and b respectively the xrd patterns of sc1 and sc2 in fig 6 a shows peaks at 2θ values around 26 49 33 8 37 58 51 67 and 65 81 71 25 which were assigned to the 110 101 200 211 301 and 202 crystal planes respectively all the peaks of sc1 and sc2 nps are found to be matched well with the standard tetragonal structured sno2 nps jcpds 41 1445 the xrd patterns of ss1 and ss2 nps are represented in fig 6 b where it shows diffraction peaks at 2θ values approximately around 26 58 33 78 37 9 51 86 54 7 57 94 61 9 64 84 65 92 71 26 and 78 84 which corresponds to 110 101 200 211 220 002 310 112 301 202 and 321 planes respectively which reflects to the pure phase of tetragonal rutile sno2 crystal jcpds 41 1445 no impurity peaks were observed in any of the xrd patterns from collective results it also verifies the formation of sno2 nps with polycrystalline in nature from xrd data we can take the full width at half maximum fwhm of the diffraction peak to calculate the average crystallite size using the debye scherrer equation 2 d k λ β c o s θ where d is taken as the crystallite size in nm λ is the diffraction wavelength in å β is the fwhm in radian θ is the diffraction angle in degree and k is a constant which also called as shape factor and its value is close to unity therefore the average crystallite size of the prepared sno2 nps sc1 sc2 ss1 and ss2 are calculated using the above equation and are found to be 8 nm 13 nm 9 nm and 15 nm respectively this shows that all the average crystallite size of the synthesized sno2 nps are very close to that of the average particle size measured from the tem image of sc1 sc2 ss1 and ss2 hence we can say that the xrd data of the synthesized sno2 nps are in good agreement with the tem results which further confirms the formation of sno2 nps 3 3 uv vis studies all the uv absorbance of the synthesized sno2 nps were carried at room temperature fig 7 a gives the uv vis absorption spectra of the sc1 sc2 ss1 and ss2 exhibiting small absorption peaks at around 310 nm and 303 nm for sc1 and sc2 the sc2 nps also shows a shoulder peak at around 438 nm in case of ss1 absorbance spectra exhibit a shoulder peak at about 231 nm and three more absorption peak at around 327 nm 484 nm and 539 nm for ss2 the maximum absorption onset is observed around 223 nm with three more peaks at around 304 nm 490 nm and 527 nm from the uv absorbance spectra it is observed that there is a common spectral range in all the synthesized sno2 np which range from 303 to 327 nm it also observed on increasing the annealing temperature the peaks from this range shift to the left side in both the cases i e peaks for sc1 and ss1 at around 310 and 327 shifts to 303 and 304 in case of sc2 and ss2 respectively in semiconductor nanomaterials like sno2 it is expected to have the quantum confinement effect exclusive optical properties are observed in semiconductor nanoparticles depends firmly on the particle size of nps therefore the particle size of semiconductors plays a strong role in band gap energy tauc plot can be used to determine the band gap energy eg of the prepared sc1 sc2 ss1 and ss2 nps from the uv absorption spectra for semiconductors the optical absorbance coefficient α with incident photon energy can be expressed as 3 α ν h ν k h ν e g n where hν is the photoenergy eg is the absorption bandgap energy ev k is constant α ν is the absorption coefficient that can be expressed by the beer lambert law as ɑ υ 2 203aρ cl where a is the absorbance a u ρ is the density of the sno2 nanoparticles in g cm3 c is the concentration in mg l and l is the path length in cm the value of n varies on different type of transition therefore when the value of n is 1 2 2 3 2 and 3 for allowed direct allowed indirect forbidden direct and forbidden indirect transitions respectively in the case of semiconductor nanomaterial like sno2 nanoparticles n is equal to1 2 which is allowed the direct transition optical band gap energy eg value can be achieved extrapolation of the curve to zero absorption coefficient of the plot obtained by plotting αhν 2vs hν 6 9 therefore fig 7 b shows the extrapolation curve of the tauc plot of sc1 sc2 ss1 and ss2 nanoparticles from which the calculated band gap energy was found to be 4 08 3 95 4 0 and 3 9 ev respectively the band gap increases with decreasing particle size indicating that the particles are really in the quantum regime herein it is evident that on increase in the size of the sno2 nanoparticles band gap energy decreases therefore the sno2 particles are in the quantum regime 3 4 ftir analysis the ftir spectra of the prepared sno2 nanoparticles can give the idea of chemical composition fig 8 gives the typical ftir spectrum of sc1 sc2 ss1 and ss2 nps the occurrence characteristic sharp band of sno2 nps at around 620 cm 1 and 627 cm 1 due to the sn o sn anti symmetric vibrations are observed in case of sc1 sc2 ss1 and ss2 respectively begum et al 2016b in all the synthesized sno2nps the bands at around 1628 1634 and 3426 3434 cm 1 are originated due to the bending vibration of absorbed water molecule on the surface of the sno2 nps and due to the stretching vibrations of oh groups respectively these bands are generally due to the moisture adsorbed during sample preparation the band around 2927 cm 1observed in all the synthesized nanoparticles can be attributed to the asymmetric c h stretching which is due to the alkyl chain of the incorporated surfactant residuals in all the synthesized nanoparticles it is found that with increasing the annealing temperature the peaks due to oh group decreased due to the loss of water molecule at higher temperature 3 5 assessment of photocatalytic activity of prepared sno2 nanoparticles evaluation of the catalytic activity of the synthesized sno2 nps was done by observing the change in optical absorption of cbz drug solutions during its photodegradation process cbz drug shows a characteristic absorption maximum at 285 nm on uv vis spectra here the decrease in the absorption peak at 285 nm was taken into account as no other new characteristic peaks were observed during the progress of degradation process karpinska et al 2015 pereira et al 2007 from the dark study it showed negligible removal of cbz and hence neglected in the entire study investigated below it is found from the literature that the photocatalyst having a greater surface area shows maximum photocatalytic activity greater surface area of photocatalyst enables the dispersal of the cbz molecules to the active sites the sno2 photocatalyst resulting in maximum photodegradation therefore for the current study sc1 and ss1 sno2 nps were selected out of all the four synthesized sno2 nps sc1 sc2 ss1 and ss2 due to their smaller size and high surface area 3 5 1 effect of catalyst loading the effect of the amount of sno2 on degradation efficiency of cbz was evaluated by changing the amount of catalyst loading keeping other parameters constant i e cbz concentration of 10 ppm and ph 5 the catalyst loading was varied from 0 1 g l to 1 0 g l the optimum catalyst amount was determined by varying the catalyst concentrations i e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 1 0 g l maximum degradation of cbz about 97 in the case of sc1 and 95 in the case of ss1 was obtained at an optimum catalyst concentration of 0 5 g l and 0 6 g l respectively from this dose study as shown in fig 9 a it is found that sc1 is a better catalyst than ss1 as with a lower catalytic dose it gives higher degradation efficiency than ss1 more precisely it can be stated that with a dose of 0 5 g l of photocatalyst it is found that 97 of cbz is degraded in case of sc1 whereas 92 of cbz is degraded in case of ss1 respectively the excessive use of photocatalyst would increase solution opacity therefore the catalytic loading beyond the optimum value increases the turbidity of the suspension and light scattering and thereby a decrease in the penetration of photons deep in the suspension hence all the catalyst surface cannot be activated which results in the decrease in number of the production of active radicals and thereby decreases in the efficiency of photodegradation determination of optimum catalyst loading is very important in order to avoid an unnecessary use of photocatalysts and to get the highest photodegradation efficiency 3 5 2 effect of initial cbz concentration the effect of initial concentration of cbz was studied by keeping a fixed concentration of sno2 nanoparticles sc1 and ss1 0 6 g l and 5 0 g l and ph 5 of the reaction mixture the optimum concentration of cbz was obtained by varying cbz concentration from 5 to 25 ppm five different cbz concentrations of 5 10 15 20 and 25 ppm were selected at cbz concentration of 5 ppm highest degradation in case of both ss1 and sc1 as shown in fig 9 b as the concentration of cbz increased the percentage of drug degradation was decreased this is due to retardation in light penetration into the solution as on increasing the initial concentration of the cbz the path length of photons entering the solution decreases houas et al 2001 again on increasing the initial drug concentration the requisite catalyst surface area for degradation of cbz will be more for which more catalyst loading will be necessary which in turn again increase solution opacity georgaki et al 2014 from this study it is found that sc1 nanoparticles show better photocatalytic activity than ss1 nanocatalyst 3 5 3 effect of contact time fig 9 c shows the effect of contact time with catalysts on photodegradation of cbz the uv visible spectra of photodegradation of cbz solution in presence of sno2 nps were recorded after regular interval of time for optimum contact time determination photodegradation process was carried out in two batches separately with optimum sno2 nanocatalyst dose of 0 6 g l and 0 5 g l of sc1 and ss1 in 200 ml of 5 ppm cbz solution at constant solution ph of 5 for 90 min under the uv c light the photocatalytic efficiency of catalysts was estimated in terms of percentage of drug degraded at a particular time it is observed that on increasing the contact time the percentage removal of the cbz drug from the solution increases and at a certain point of time that is at around 60 min the degradation percentage reaches 97 and 95 for sc1 and ss1 and after that it remains almost constant this result indicated that the interaction between the sno2 nps and cbz molecules are highest with the irradiation time of 60 min after that the surface of the catalyst gets saturated due to which further more degradation is not observed 3 5 4 effect of initial ph the determination ph is very important as in the photocatalytic degradation of cbz drug molecule by sno2 photocatalyst the ph of the suspension shows one of the important roles the effect of ph 2 9 as shown in fig 9 d in the photodegradation of cbz was studied by taking 5 ppm cbz solution and a fixed dose of sno2 photocatalyst 0 6 g l and 0 5 g l for sc1 and ss1 respectively under uv c light removal at room temperature degradation of cbz was inspected at both acidic and basic mediums by adjusting the ph with the help of 0 1 m 0 01 m hcl and naoh maximum degradation of cbz was observed in the acidic ph ph 5 total degradation at this ph was found to be around 97 and 95 within 60 min for sc1 and ss1 the sno2 nps surface is positively charged in acidic medium and in basic medium it is negatively charged since sno2 surface is positively charged at ph 5 a considerably s electrostatic attraction seems to be present between the positively charged sno2 nps surface and cbz drug molecule leading to maximum photocatalytic degradation when the ph increases the number of negatively charged sites on the sno2 nps surface do not support the degradation process due to the electrostatic repulsion between the surface and drug molecule thereby significantly decreasing the degradation process it is also observed that at very low ph at around 2 3 the degradation is low this may be due to the fact that under highly acidic conditions sno2 nps may get agglomerated thus reducing the surface area accessible for photodegradation process 3 6 comparative study of photodegradation of cbz by sc1 and ss1 nanoparticles the comparative degradation histogram of the cbz in the absence of catalyst as well as presence of both the sc1 and ss1 photocatalyst respectively are shown in fig s1 of esi to determine the comparative photocatalytic activity sno2 nanoparticles 0 5 g l of sno2 nps sc1 and ss1 respectively were dispersed in 200 ml of 5 ppm aqueous solutions cbz separately in two 500 ml conical flask and were kept in continuous stirring the solution mixture was kept in the dark under with continuous stirring for 1 h for the adsorption desorption equilibrium study in both the suspension no degradation was observed in the absence of uv c light after the completion of 1 h in the dark the solution was kept inside uv c photoreactor for another 1 h in order to study the degradation process of the drug molecule the variations in the adsorption of uv spectra of cbz solution due to degradation of the drug molecules were noted at a regular interval of time the same procedure was followed with a blank solution of cbz no variation of the band in the uv spectra of cbz was observed the uv vis absorption spectra of cbz solutions in the presence of sno2 nanoparticles sc1 and ss1 are shown in fig 10 a and b in the course of the photodegradation process of cbz drug solutions the intensity of the characteristic band at 285 nm decreases with the increase the contact time of irradiation signifying the fast degradation of cbz molecules it was observed that after 60 min the peak around 285 nm becomes almost flat in both the cases i e in presence of sc1 and ss1 as photocatalyst which indicates the complete degradation of cbz in the solution to study the catalytic activity of both the synthesized photocatalyst sc1 and ss1 the kinetics of the degradation cbz drug molecule were determined respectively it shows that it follows the pseudo first order kinetic model in both the cases which are represented using the following langmuir hinshelwood equation 4 ln c0 c kt where k is the rate constant co and c are absorbance or concentration before and after photodegradation of drug molecule respectively from equation 4 rate constant of both sc1 and ss1 can be determined by applying linear correlation the plots ln c0 c versus irradiation time t in the presence of sc1 and ss1 are shown in fig 10 c therefore the rate constant k min 1 for the degradation of cbz was calculated and found be 6 6 10 2 min 1 and 5 7 10 2 min 1 in presence of sc1 and ss1 respectively here to evaluate the kinetics of the degradation cbz drug decrease in the absorption peak at 285 nm was taken into account as no other new characteristic peaks were observed during the progress of degradation process karpinska et al 2015 this was validated from literature where it is reported that the data acquired by hplc method of the degraded solution of cbz showed formation of no new peaks due to transformation products karpinska et al 2015 pereira et al 2007 further from fig 10 d it was found that the percentage efficiency of degradation of cbz drug solution in presence of sc1 is 97 and in presence of ss1 is 92 so from all the above comparative studies it can be concluded that the sno2 nps synthesized using ctab as a surfactant sc1 shows better results as compared to the sno2 nps synthesized using sds as a surfactant therefore we can say that the sno2 nps synthesized using ctab as surfactant is a better alternative in the removal of cbz drug from wastewater 3 7 mechanism of photodegradation of cbz by sno2 nanoparticles under uv c light the residual cbz concentration in aqueous samples was first analyzed using uv vis spectrophotometry to measure the intensity change of the maximum absorbance peak at 285 nm a probable sno2 photocatalytic mechanism is shown in scheme 1 on irradiation of uv c light on the surface of sno2 nps an electron hole pair is generated eq 5 prakash et al 2016 the photogenerated electrons move from the valence band vb to the conduction band cb of photocatalyst and thereby facilitating oxygen reduction eq 6 kim et al 2016 the water molecule present on the surface of the sno2 nps captures the h and produces primarily hydroxyl radical oh eq 7 abdelkader et al 2016 the e on the conduction band reacts with oxygen radical and h produces hydrogen peroxide eq 8 wanga et al 2016 thereby cbz possibly will be reacted to different intermediates contacting with oh h o2 and hydrogen peroxide bo et al 2017 the photocatalytic degradation mechanism of cbz can be proposed as follows as in scheme 2 scheme 2 photodegradation of cbz may be directly attributed to the attack of oh resulting in the hydroxylation of either the double bond or the aromatic rings of cbz which is a major path for degradation of organic molecules sun et al 2013 the schematic representation of the degradation of cbz in presence of sc1 and ss1 is shown in fig 11 3 8 determination of probable transformation products formed during the photodegradation of cbz to study the transformation product of cbz in photodegradation process lcms was recorded using 410 prostar binary lc with 500 ms it pda detectors from the scan range of 1 690 m z to determine the probable formation of transformation product from cbz lcms analysis of the degradation solution was carried out multiple scanning of the degraded cbz solution were done in order to acquire all possible signals of intermediate products formed during photodegradation of cbz from the signal obtained from lcms analysis the m z values were observed and the possible product formation is deduced as shown in table 1 fig s2 a e of esi depicts the lcms data obtained at five scanning at three different interval of irradiation time fig s2 gives the signal of the first scan of the degraded solution that was run initially after 5 min of uv c degradation in presence of sno2 nps to determine the initial possible degradation products after that three more scans of the degraded cbz solution after 30 min of irradiation was run as shown in fig s2 b d here these three lc ms scans were run because in one scanning we may not get all the signal of the intermediates formed so two more scans were run in order to get more accuracy finally one final scanning fig s2e was done after 1 h that is on the completion of the degradation process in order to determine the lc ms signals of possible final transformation products from the lcms data the signal at m z 236 02 may be due to the parent compound cbz as shown in fig s2 a daniele et al 2017 the signal at m z 252 3 as shown in fig s2 c and d may be due to the formation of 10 11 epoxycarbamazepine which may formed through a hydration process miao and metcalfe 2003 from the literature it is found to be one of the common degradation products of cbz deng et al 2013 additionally the signals at m z 252 3 fig s2 c and d also indicates the formation of 10 1 aminovinyl 10 10 dihydroacridine 9 carbaldehyde from the epoxy bond cleavage of the 10 11 epoxcarbamazepine daniele et al 2017 again in fig s2 a and b the signal observed at m z 267 5 can be assigned to 1 1 bis 2 formylphenyl urea which might formed by the cleavage of azepine ring of 10 11 epoxcarbamazepine deng et al 2013 this product so formed may further oxidize and forms carboxylic compounds 2 2 carbamoylazanediyl dibenzoic acid whose lcms signal is observed at m z 301 in fig s2 a and d and 2 1 2 formylphenyl ureido benzoic acid at m z 285 2 by losing conh2 group as shown in fig s2 a and d deng et al 2013 hu et al 2009 the signal at m z 179 3 as depicted in fig s2 b is due to the formation of acridine daniele et al 2017 its formation might take place by the ring contraction of 10 11 epoxycarbamazepine which leads to the formation of acridine 9 carbaldehyde as observed in fig s2 b at m z 208 4 again loss of cho group from acridine 9 carbaldehyde results in acridine formation kosjek et al 2009 acridine is one of the most common photodegradation products of cbz reported in all the literature calisto et al 2011 acridine further transforms into acridin 9 10h one which is observed at m z 195 of fig s2 c daniele et al 2017 the transformation products 2 2 carbamoylazanediyl dibenzoic acid and 2 1 2 formylphenyl ureido benzoic acid may further lose functional groups like conh2 cho and co or combines to hydroxy group to produce compounds like 2 aminobenzoic acid and 2 hydroxybenzoic acid on hydroxidation whose signals were observed in fig s2 c at m z 139 3 and 138 3 vogna et al 2004 further the signal observed in fig s2 b at m z 105 and 151 2 may be ascribed to the formation of benzaldehyde and an acidic aromatic intermediate 2 formylbenzoic acid bo et al 2017 lcms data of the completed degraded solution as shown in fig s2 e shows signals at m z 132 16 116 2 and 74 04 which may be because of the formation of short chain aliphatic acids like 4 hydroxy 2 3 dioxobutanoic acid maleic acid fumaric acid and propionic acid generated on the complete cleavage of the benzene ring bo et al 2017 a probable mechanistic path is deduced based on all the m z values obtain from lcms of photodegradation solution of cbz fig 12 3 9 recyclability of prepared nanoparticles the recyclability of the photocatalyst is an essential part of the photodegradation process to estimate the stability and efficiency of the prepared sno2 photocatalyst the recovered catalyst was reused again for the degradation of cbz solution this process as repeatedly studied for 8 times and was found that no noteworthy decrease of photocatalytic activity of prepared sno2 nps was observed an in appreciable loss of photocatalytic activity was observed after the fifth cycle of the photodegradation process as shown in fig s3 of esi this minute loss in photocatalytic activity may be due to inaccessibility of surface site on synthesized sno2 nps after the 5th cycle hence we can say that the prepared sno2 nps is an excellent reusable photocatalyst and could be used up to 8 cycles for the photodegradation of cbz molecules to determine the crystallinity and morphological changes of the prepared sno2photocatalyst tem and xrd analysis were done before and after degradation of cbz fig s4 as shown in esi represents the tem images of sc1 and ss1 after photodegradation of cbz on comparing the tem images of sc1 and ss1 nanocatalyst before and after photocatalysis no characteristic change in morphology was found nor was any kind of agglomeration observed fig s4b shows the xrd patterns of sc1 and ss1 nanoparticles after degradation of cbz no significant changes in crystallinity were observed in the xrd pattern of sc1 and ss1 nanoparticles before and after photodegradation all the crystallographic planes of sc1 and ss1 nanoparticles after degradation remain same as that of before photocatalysis 4 conclusion in conclusion it is found that sno2 nanoparticles were efficaciously synthesized employing a simple chemical precipitation method using aspartic acid anhydrous and surfactant such as ctab and sds from the comparative study of all the characterization it is found that the size of the particles can be tuned by changing the surfactants and increasing annealing temperature it is confirmed from tem images and xrd patterns that the sno2 nps synthesized with cationic surfactant ctab sc1 and sc2 forms smaller sized nanoparticles 8 and 13 5 nm than that of the nanoparticles synthesized with anionic surfactant sds ss1 and ss2 with sizes of 9 5 and 15 5 nm respectively it also confirms that all the sno2 nps synthesized both with ctab and sds by this method forms spherical in shape tetragonal rutile structure and polycrystalline nature again from the tem images and xrd it showed that the sno2 nanoparticles sc1 and ss1 synthesized at a lower annealing temperature at 300 c forms average sizes of 8 and 9 5 and higher annealing temperature at 600 c forms average particle sizes of 13 5 and 15 5 nm respectively therefore it is manifest that annealing temperature also plays a great role in controlling the size of the particles as increasing the annealing temperature the size of the sno2 nps increases from the band gap energy study it is found that in case of smaller size of the sno2 nps sc1 and ss1 which shows band gap energy 4 08 and 4 0 ev which is higher as compared with the greater sized sno2 nps sc2 and ss2 which is about 3 95 and 3 9 ev respectively due to the quantum confinement effects blue shift in band gap energy is observed therefore it can be marked from all the above observation that the size of the nanoparticles depends on the annealing temperature it is also observed that the band gap energy depends on the size of the synthesized sno2 nps the photocatalytic activity study on the photodegradation of cbz drug showed that synthesized sc1 and ss1 nps can degrade 97 and 92 respectively within 60 min under uv c light the kinetic study confirms that the rate constant for sc1 is 6 66 10 2 min 1 which is higher than the rate constant of ss1 5 7 10 2 min 1 from all the comparative study it is found that sno2 nps synthesized with ctab shows better photocatalytic activity than the sno2 np synthesized with sds from the lcms analysis it was found the photodegradation of cbz results in the formation of various transformation products lcms analysis of the complete degradation of cbz solution shows the formation of four different short chain aliphatic acids the reusability study of the synthesized sno2 nps sc1 and ss1 shows that it can run up to 8 cycles without affecting its structural and morphological properties further it is confirmed

catalytic loading initial concentration ph and contact time were also studied for optimization the results indicate that sc1 is a better photocatalyst with rate constant 6 66 10 2 min 1 than ss1 with rate 5 7 10 2 min 1 to determine the transformation product formed on the photodegradation lcms esi analysis was done the synthesized sno2 nps can be recycled up to 8th cycles without any notable alteration in its photocatalytic activity graphical abstract image 1 keywords sno2 nanoparticles aspartic acid anhydrous ctab sds carbamazepine uv c light 1 introduction in recent years organic micropollutants omps are largely discharged into the environment with wastewater in numerous forms these omps mostly signifies a wide spectrum of chemical used in pharmaceutical products which are consumed in various forms regularly samaras et al 2013 tijani et al 2013 rapid population growth industrialization and commercialization have further worsened this concern the demand for large volumes of clean water resources makes it necessary to remove these omps from wastewater by conventional treatment systems joss et al 2006 around the world according to the world health organization who approximately 750 million people not accessible to developed sources of drinking water unicef and who 2012 pharmaceutically active compounds phacs are commonly reported omps present in municipal wastewater streams lekkerkerker teunissen et al 2012 the presence of this phacs in aquatic environment gave rise to environmental issues and possible risk on human and nature xiu shengmiao et al 2005 even though in the aquatic environment phacs are present at low levels but its prolong participation may lead to toxic effect into the environment oetken et al 2005 feces and urine are the main sources of phacs and due to partial absorption of medicine by the body it gives out in unchanged as well as metabolites forms lam and mabury 2005 ternes 1998 in the present work carbamazepine cbz is taken in aqueous phases as a sedative drug cbz can give rise to severe toxicity in the emopoietic and liver system molinari et al 2006 this recalcitrant drug show comparatively high hydrophobicity in deionized water ojajuni et al 2016 furthermore being a psychoactive drug so it can potentially hamper the predator s escaping ability in fish keen et al 2012 apart from the continuous input of cbz into the aquatic environment this drug is also highly resistant to biodegradation and because it possesses low octanol water partition coefficient it is expected to remain in the aqueous phase aswaghosh et al 2016 from the literature it is studied that pharmaceutical drugs are sensitive to photodegradation in various experiment using sunlight uv lamps etc were performed for its removal from the wastewater young et al 2014 challis et al 2014 georgaki et al 2014 achilleos et al 2010 therefore various removal process such as adsorption photochemical process biological process and photodegradation process had been opted since past few years for the removal of this harmful drug baghdadi et al 2016 laurentiis et al 2012 kosjek et al 2009 haroune et al 2014 semiconductor nanoparticles such as zno tio2 had been used extensively for the photodegradation of cbz drug georgaki et al 2014 achilleos et al 2010 rutile type sno2 crystal is an n type semiconductor with a versatile wide band gap of 3 6 ev at 300 k derbal et al 2008 due to their excellent chemical stability optical and gas sensing properties these semiconductor metal oxide structures are extravagantly explored in the field of catalysis dye based solar cells transistors light emitting diodes gas sensors etc prakash et al 2016 carreño et al 2004 shang et al 2012 sberveglieri 1992 wang and chen 2009 li et al 2002 sno2 nanocrystals show an excellent photocatalytic activity in the presence of visible as well as uv lights elango and roopan 2016 therefore sno2 nps were widely employed as a photocatalyst in the degradation of harmful organic dyes srivastava and mukhopadhyay 2014 it is found that sno2 have a very low toxicity level as well as no significant carcinogenic properties and poorly absorbed by the body begum et al 2016a in recent years it is found show excellent response as an antibacterial as well as antioxidant agent vidhu and philip 2015 various other metal oxide semiconductor nanoparticles like tio2 ceo2 al2o3 have also been explored in various applications mora sero et al 2007 wang et al 2014 tzompantzi et al 2014 however the precursors for the synthesis of sno2 nanoparticles are of low cost and easy handling as compared to other metal oxides nanoparticles ibarguen et al 2007 numerous techniques like sol gel microwave spray pyrolysis hydrothermal and chemical precipitation route have been successfully used to synthesize nanoparticles begum et al 2016b muneer et al 2015 madhu et al 2013 efforts are made to develop a better synthetic route with the advantages of the simple and easy process with great purity controlled morphology and particle size distribution chemical homogeneity and low toxicity chemical precipitation method possess various advantages over other methods for the synthesis of different types of metal oxides nanoparticles as it provides high purity of product low cost good homogeneity and no organic solvents are needed in the process of synthesis and also more dispersed particles can be obtained nazari et al 2014 gaber et al 2014 therefore in the present work we have opted chemical precipitation method for the synthesis of sno2 nps additionally in chemical precipitation method annealing at high temperature is required so that the size of the nanoparticle can be modified according to their application gaber et al 2014 the size of the nanoparticles gets increased with increasing the annealing temperature in the synthesis of nanoparticles surfactant like cationic anionic and nonionic can acts as a stabilizing agent and it also plays a great role in controlling the size of the nanoparticles as well as it minimizes agglomerations pandey and dixit 2011 surfactants mostly are amphiphiles with hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups heinz et al 2017 these head groups actually prevent the agglomeration of the particles and also control their size it is found that surfactant molecules have also been employed as capping agents lee et al 2002 the surfactant molecules act as the hybrid building blocks for conversion into higher order structures by getting attached to the surface of nanoparticles li et al 1999 in the present work the role of cationic surfactant ctab and anionic surfactants sds in the synthesis of sno2 nanoparticles is investigated the effect of surfactants on the size and morphology of sno2 nanoparticles is also studied in the present study sno2 nanoparticles were synthesized by simple cost effective safe routes using cheap and non toxic reagents in order to control the size of the nanoparticles as well as it minimizes agglomerations cationic surfactant ctab and anionic surfactants sds were employed the effect on the synthesized sno2 nanoparticles with the annealing temperature is also investigated the synthesized sno2 nps were employed for the photodegradation of cbz drug under uv light to the best knowledge of the authors the photodegradation of the cbz drug by using sno2nps as a catalyst was performed for the first time 2 experimental 2 1 materials stannous chloride dehydrates sncl2 2h2o aspartic acid anhydrous cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and carbamazepines cbz were analytical grade and all were purchased from sigma aldrich double distilled water was used as a solvent in all the experiments 2 2 synthesis of sno2 nanoparticles photocatalyst sno2 nanoparticles were synthesized by a simple chemical precipitation method where 100 ml aqueous anhydrous aspartic acid solution 0 1 m was added to 100 ml 0 1 m sncl2 2h2o solution with continuous stirring to the solution mixture 10 ml 0 06 m ctab solution was added dropwise and was stirred for 3 h on a magnetic stirrer at 100 c then a light yellow precipitate so formed which was kept for 24 h to get matured then the resulting precipitate was washed with distilled water for several times to remove the impurities as well as excess surfactant and dried in an oven at 60 c for 12 h which results in a pale yellow powder this pale yellow powder was further annealed at two different temperatures i e 300 and 600 c and was marked sc1 and sc2 the same procedure was followed for the synthesis of sno2 nanoparticles using the aqueous aspartic acid solution sncl2 2h2o and sds as a surfactant it was also annealed at two different temperatures i e 300 and 600 c and marked as ss1 and ss2 the systematic scheme of the reaction is shown below scheme 1 2 3 characterization of synthesized sno2 nanoparticles to study the size morphology and diffraction ring of the so prepared sno2 nanoparticles before and after photodegradation of cbz were exemplified via tem transmission electron microscopy hrtem high resolution transmission electron microscopy and saed the selected area electron diffraction by using jem 2100 transmission electron further the synthesized sno2 nanocatalyst before and after photodegradation was illustrated by powder x ray diffraction xrd method using phillips x pert pro diffractometer with cu kα radiation of wavelength 1 5418 å uv visible spectra of the synthesized sno2 nanoparticles were recorded using genesys 10s uv vis spectrophotometer operational with quartz cell of path length 1 cm from wavelength between 200 nm and 400 nm at a speed of 600 nm min 1 infrared ft ir spectra were recorded in the wave number range from 400 to 4000 cm 1 by bruker hyperion 3000 ftir spectrometer the mass spectrometry was performed using liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer 410 prostar binary lc with 500 ms it pda detectors varian inc usa ionization was operated using an esi source in positive ion mode data acquisition was performed with bruker compass data analysis 4 1 2 4 setup of uv c light photoreactor in the present study the uv c light was used for the degradation of the cbz drug molecule fig 1 shows the setup of the uv c light photoreactor used in the degradation of cbz drug in this setup a stainless steel chamber with dimension of 45 cm 40 cm 45 cm inside the chamber a magnetic stirrer was kept and on the roof of the chamber there consist of three philips tuv 36 w uv c lamps of wavelength 254 nm which were set up in parallel the irradiance on the surface of solution mixture is 3 2 mw cm2 it is measured using lutron uvc 254 uv light meter by placing on the surface of the solution mixture which was kept 7 cm away from the uv c lamps the electric wiring of the uv c light and magnetic stirrer is connected to a switchboard outside the chamber the door of the chamber is kept in the front with lock system through which the sample can be kept inside to perform the experiment the drug solution along with the photocatalyst was kept in a borosil beaker with a magnetic needle the beaker was kept on the magnetic stirrer inside the chamber at a fixed position with a distance of 7 cm away from the lamps and the door was kept locked the switch of both the magnetic stirrer and uv light were kept on for the photoreaction process when withdrawing of the suspension is required both the switch of uv light and magnetic stirrer should be kept off before unlocking the door and then the beaker can be removed 2 5 photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine the photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine was performed by taking different experimental conditions under the uv c light the photocatalytic experiments were carried out by the dispersion of required amount 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 g l of both the synthesized sno2 nanoparticles i e sc1 and ss1 in 200 ml different concentrations i e 5 10 15 20 and 25 ppm of carbamazepine cbz solution respectively in two separate 500 ml borosil beaker and was kept for continuous stirring on a magnetic stirrer this solution mixture was kept in the dark under with continuous stirring for 1 h before uv irradiation for the adsorption desorption equilibrium the adsorption desorption study depicted in fig s1 of esi shows that a very minute percentage of the cbz was removed in presence of both the sc1 and ss1 nanoparticles respectively so removal of cbz due to adsorption can be neglected in this study for the analysis of the photocatalytic activity of the synthesized sno2 nanocatalyst the solution mixture of sno2 nps and cbz solution was kept under uv c light philips tuv 36 w uv c lamp with a continuous stirring condition at room temperature for 1 h a total of 2 ml of the solution mixture was withdrawn after every constant interval of time and then centrifuged the supernatant was monitored in a uv vis spectrophotometer genesys 10s uv vis spectrophotometer operational with 1 cm quartz cell to determine the concentration of cbz remaining in the solution mixture after every withdrawal a fresh solution mixture was set for photodegradation experiment and kept for irradiation for the required time for the accuracy of the results this procedure was continued until the maximum removal of cbz from aqueous solution was observed the same study was performed under uv light with a blank solution of cbz the blank solution of cbz was prepared by taking known concentrations i e 5 10 15 20 and 25 ppm of aqueous cbz solution without the addition of any photocatalysts and was kept under uv c light with the same conditions as that of photodegradation experiments carried out for cbz solution in presence of photocatalyst till maximum removal of cbz was attained here also the cbz solution was continuously monitored using uv vis spectrophotometer using the given equation percentage degradation of the cbz can be calculated 1 percentage efficiency c0 c c0 100 where co and c are the concentration of cbz in initial and at time t in min respectively here both in dark and blank study of the photodegradation showed almost negligible removal of cbz and no degradation of cbz respectively as shown in fig s1 of esi 2 6 reusability of the photocatalyst reusability of a catalyst is a very important factor to establish the durability of the catalyst therefore to evaluate the efficiency of sno2 nps a recyclability test was performed after completing the photodegradation process the used photocatalyst was recovered by centrifugation and was passed to whatman no 42 filter paper to collect the catalyst the obtained catalyst was washed several times with hot water and finally once with acetone and then dried in a hot air oven for 3 h at 60 c then the recovered catalyst was again used for the photodegradation of cbz solution and the percentage removal was noted using equation 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 tem hrtem and saed studies the synthesized sno2 nanoparticles nps synthesized by both the surfactant i e ctab and sds at different temperature were characterized by its tem images and saed patterns for size distribution and morphological study from the hrtem images of all the synthesized sno2 nps the microstructure is scrutinized the tem image fig 2 a of sc1 shows that particles are spherical in shape with an average size of 8 nm form the tem image particle size distribution histogram shown in fig 2d is also obtained which also illustrates that the average size diameter of sc1 nps is 8 nm from the hrtem images and saed patterns lattice fringes and diameter diffraction rings can be calculated therefore fig 2b depicts the hrtem image of sc1 which on the calculation of the lattice spacing shows 0 26 nm and 0 178 nm which are corresponding to 101 and 211 lattice plane of typical sno2 fig 2c shows the saed pattern of sc1which show bright concentric diffraction ring indicating it to be polycrystalline in nature from the diffraction ring it was also revealed that it goes well with the 110 101 200 211 and 301 plane of tetragonal rutile structure of sno2 jcpds 41 1445 fig 3 a displays the tem image of sno2 nanoparticles sc2 from which the size of the particles was found to be 13 5 nm it is also observed that the particles were well dispersed and the size of the particles is larger than the nanoparticles of sc1 the hrtem image i e fig 3b shows that the calculated lattice fringe is 0 176 which corresponds to 211 plane of sno2 fig 3c shows the saed patterns of sc2 which shows concentric circles indicating it to be polycrystalline in nature on the calculation of the d spacing from the diameter of the concentric circle of saed patterns it was found that all the planes match well with the standard sno2 again from the particle distribution histogram chart fig 3d shows that the average size of the sc2 nanoparticles was 13 5 nm from the tem image and the particle size distribution histogram of ss1 nps shown in fig 4 a and d discloses that the average size of the particles is 9 5 nm it also shows that it is well dispersed and spherical in shape the hrtem image shown in fig 4b gives two interplanar distances around 0 26 nm which can be assigned with the 101 diffraction planes of the tetragonal rutile structure of sno2 fig 4c represents the saed pattern recorded for ss1 nps the bright concentric diffraction rings of the saed patterns depicts that the ss1 nps are polycrystalline in nature and on calculation it shows that the d value corresponds to plane 110 101 200 and 211 of rutile structure of standard sno2 jcpds 41 1445 fig 5 a and d illustrate the tem image and particle size distribution histogram of ss2 nps it was found the average diameter of ss2 nps is 15 5 nm from the hrtem image given in the figure 5b shows that the lattice fringes of 0 23 nm which is attributed to 200 lattice plane of standard sno2 the saed patterns in fig 5c shows many concentric circles which attribute high polycrystallinity nature and on the calculation of d spacing from the diameter of the concentric circles it is found the all the plane 110 200 and 220 matches perfectly with the lattice plane of the tetragonal rutile crystal structure of sno2 jcpds 41 1445 3 2 xrd studies the xrd pattern of sno2 nps prepared using ctab sc1 and sc2 and sds ss1 and ss2 as surfactant is shown in fig 6 a and b respectively the xrd patterns of sc1 and sc2 in fig 6 a shows peaks at 2θ values around 26 49 33 8 37 58 51 67 and 65 81 71 25 which were assigned to the 110 101 200 211 301 and 202 crystal planes respectively all the peaks of sc1 and sc2 nps are found to be matched well with the standard tetragonal structured sno2 nps jcpds 41 1445 the xrd patterns of ss1 and ss2 nps are represented in fig 6 b where it shows diffraction peaks at 2θ values approximately around 26 58 33 78 37 9 51 86 54 7 57 94 61 9 64 84 65 92 71 26 and 78 84 which corresponds to 110 101 200 211 220 002 310 112 301 202 and 321 planes respectively which reflects to the pure phase of tetragonal rutile sno2 crystal jcpds 41 1445 no impurity peaks were observed in any of the xrd patterns from collective results it also verifies the formation of sno2 nps with polycrystalline in nature from xrd data we can take the full width at half maximum fwhm of the diffraction peak to calculate the average crystallite size using the debye scherrer equation 2 d k λ β c o s θ where d is taken as the crystallite size in nm λ is the diffraction wavelength in å β is the fwhm in radian θ is the diffraction angle in degree and k is a constant which also called as shape factor and its value is close to unity therefore the average crystallite size of the prepared sno2 nps sc1 sc2 ss1 and ss2 are calculated using the above equation and are found to be 8 nm 13 nm 9 nm and 15 nm respectively this shows that all the average crystallite size of the synthesized sno2 nps are very close to that of the average particle size measured from the tem image of sc1 sc2 ss1 and ss2 hence we can say that the xrd data of the synthesized sno2 nps are in good agreement with the tem results which further confirms the formation of sno2 nps 3 3 uv vis studies all the uv absorbance of the synthesized sno2 nps were carried at room temperature fig 7 a gives the uv vis absorption spectra of the sc1 sc2 ss1 and ss2 exhibiting small absorption peaks at around 310 nm and 303 nm for sc1 and sc2 the sc2 nps also shows a shoulder peak at around 438 nm in case of ss1 absorbance spectra exhibit a shoulder peak at about 231 nm and three more absorption peak at around 327 nm 484 nm and 539 nm for ss2 the maximum absorption onset is observed around 223 nm with three more peaks at around 304 nm 490 nm and 527 nm from the uv absorbance spectra it is observed that there is a common spectral range in all the synthesized sno2 np which range from 303 to 327 nm it also observed on increasing the annealing temperature the peaks from this range shift to the left side in both the cases i e peaks for sc1 and ss1 at around 310 and 327 shifts to 303 and 304 in case of sc2 and ss2 respectively in semiconductor nanomaterials like sno2 it is expected to have the quantum confinement effect exclusive optical properties are observed in semiconductor nanoparticles depends firmly on the particle size of nps therefore the particle size of semiconductors plays a strong role in band gap energy tauc plot can be used to determine the band gap energy eg of the prepared sc1 sc2 ss1 and ss2 nps from the uv absorption spectra for semiconductors the optical absorbance coefficient α with incident photon energy can be expressed as 3 α ν h ν k h ν e g n where hν is the photoenergy eg is the absorption bandgap energy ev k is constant α ν is the absorption coefficient that can be expressed by the beer lambert law as ɑ υ 2 203aρ cl where a is the absorbance a u ρ is the density of the sno2 nanoparticles in g cm3 c is the concentration in mg l and l is the path length in cm the value of n varies on different type of transition therefore when the value of n is 1 2 2 3 2 and 3 for allowed direct allowed indirect forbidden direct and forbidden indirect transitions respectively in the case of semiconductor nanomaterial like sno2 nanoparticles n is equal to1 2 which is allowed the direct transition optical band gap energy eg value can be achieved extrapolation of the curve to zero absorption coefficient of the plot obtained by plotting αhν 2vs hν 6 9 therefore fig 7 b shows the extrapolation curve of the tauc plot of sc1 sc2 ss1 and ss2 nanoparticles from which the calculated band gap energy was found to be 4 08 3 95 4 0 and 3 9 ev respectively the band gap increases with decreasing particle size indicating that the particles are really in the quantum regime herein it is evident that on increase in the size of the sno2 nanoparticles band gap energy decreases therefore the sno2 particles are in the quantum regime 3 4 ftir analysis the ftir spectra of the prepared sno2 nanoparticles can give the idea of chemical composition fig 8 gives the typical ftir spectrum of sc1 sc2 ss1 and ss2 nps the occurrence characteristic sharp band of sno2 nps at around 620 cm 1 and 627 cm 1 due to the sn o sn anti symmetric vibrations are observed in case of sc1 sc2 ss1 and ss2 respectively begum et al 2016b in all the synthesized sno2nps the bands at around 1628 1634 and 3426 3434 cm 1 are originated due to the bending vibration of absorbed water molecule on the surface of the sno2 nps and due to the stretching vibrations of oh groups respectively these bands are generally due to the moisture adsorbed during sample preparation the band around 2927 cm 1observed in all the synthesized nanoparticles can be attributed to the asymmetric c h stretching which is due to the alkyl chain of the incorporated surfactant residuals in all the synthesized nanoparticles it is found that with increasing the annealing temperature the peaks due to oh group decreased due to the loss of water molecule at higher temperature 3 5 assessment of photocatalytic activity of prepared sno2 nanoparticles evaluation of the catalytic activity of the synthesized sno2 nps was done by observing the change in optical absorption of cbz drug solutions during its photodegradation process cbz drug shows a characteristic absorption maximum at 285 nm on uv vis spectra here the decrease in the absorption peak at 285 nm was taken into account as no other new characteristic peaks were observed during the progress of degradation process karpinska et al 2015 pereira et al 2007 from the dark study it showed negligible removal of cbz and hence neglected in the entire study investigated below it is found from the literature that the photocatalyst having a greater surface area shows maximum photocatalytic activity greater surface area of photocatalyst enables the dispersal of the cbz molecules to the active sites the sno2 photocatalyst resulting in maximum photodegradation therefore for the current study sc1 and ss1 sno2 nps were selected out of all the four synthesized sno2 nps sc1 sc2 ss1 and ss2 due to their smaller size and high surface area 3 5 1 effect of catalyst loading the effect of the amount of sno2 on degradation efficiency of cbz was evaluated by changing the amount of catalyst loading keeping other parameters constant i e cbz concentration of 10 ppm and ph 5 the catalyst loading was varied from 0 1 g l to 1 0 g l the optimum catalyst amount was determined by varying the catalyst concentrations i e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 1 0 g l maximum degradation of cbz about 97 in the case of sc1 and 95 in the case of ss1 was obtained at an optimum catalyst concentration of 0 5 g l and 0 6 g l respectively from this dose study as shown in fig 9 a it is found that sc1 is a better catalyst than ss1 as with a lower catalytic dose it gives higher degradation efficiency than ss1 more precisely it can be stated that with a dose of 0 5 g l of photocatalyst it is found that 97 of cbz is degraded in case of sc1 whereas 92 of cbz is degraded in case of ss1 respectively the excessive use of photocatalyst would increase solution opacity therefore the catalytic loading beyond the optimum value increases the turbidity of the suspension and light scattering and thereby a decrease in the penetration of photons deep in the suspension hence all the catalyst surface cannot be activated which results in the decrease in number of the production of active radicals and thereby decreases in the efficiency of photodegradation determination of optimum catalyst loading is very important in order to avoid an unnecessary use of photocatalysts and to get the highest photodegradation efficiency 3 5 2 effect of initial cbz concentration the effect of initial concentration of cbz was studied by keeping a fixed concentration of sno2 nanoparticles sc1 and ss1 0 6 g l and 5 0 g l and ph 5 of the reaction mixture the optimum concentration of cbz was obtained by varying cbz concentration from 5 to 25 ppm five different cbz concentrations of 5 10 15 20 and 25 ppm were selected at cbz concentration of 5 ppm highest degradation in case of both ss1 and sc1 as shown in fig 9 b as the concentration of cbz increased the percentage of drug degradation was decreased this is due to retardation in light penetration into the solution as on increasing the initial concentration of the cbz the path length of photons entering the solution decreases houas et al 2001 again on increasing the initial drug concentration the requisite catalyst surface area for degradation of cbz will be more for which more catalyst loading will be necessary which in turn again increase solution opacity georgaki et al 2014 from this study it is found that sc1 nanoparticles show better photocatalytic activity than ss1 nanocatalyst 3 5 3 effect of contact time fig 9 c shows the effect of contact time with catalysts on photodegradation of cbz the uv visible spectra of photodegradation of cbz solution in presence of sno2 nps were recorded after regular interval of time for optimum contact time determination photodegradation process was carried out in two batches separately with optimum sno2 nanocatalyst dose of 0 6 g l and 0 5 g l of sc1 and ss1 in 200 ml of 5 ppm cbz solution at constant solution ph of 5 for 90 min under the uv c light the photocatalytic efficiency of catalysts was estimated in terms of percentage of drug degraded at a particular time it is observed that on increasing the contact time the percentage removal of the cbz drug from the solution increases and at a certain point of time that is at around 60 min the degradation percentage reaches 97 and 95 for sc1 and ss1 and after that it remains almost constant this result indicated that the interaction between the sno2 nps and cbz molecules are highest with the irradiation time of 60 min after that the surface of the catalyst gets saturated due to which further more degradation is not observed 3 5 4 effect of initial ph the determination ph is very important as in the photocatalytic degradation of cbz drug molecule by sno2 photocatalyst the ph of the suspension shows one of the important roles the effect of ph 2 9 as shown in fig 9 d in the photodegradation of cbz was studied by taking 5 ppm cbz solution and a fixed dose of sno2 photocatalyst 0 6 g l and 0 5 g l for sc1 and ss1 respectively under uv c light removal at room temperature degradation of cbz was inspected at both acidic and basic mediums by adjusting the ph with the help of 0 1 m 0 01 m hcl and naoh maximum degradation of cbz was observed in the acidic ph ph 5 total degradation at this ph was found to be around 97 and 95 within 60 min for sc1 and ss1 the sno2 nps surface is positively charged in acidic medium and in basic medium it is negatively charged since sno2 surface is positively charged at ph 5 a considerably s electrostatic attraction seems to be present between the positively charged sno2 nps surface and cbz drug molecule leading to maximum photocatalytic degradation when the ph increases the number of negatively charged sites on the sno2 nps surface do not support the degradation process due to the electrostatic repulsion between the surface and drug molecule thereby significantly decreasing the degradation process it is also observed that at very low ph at around 2 3 the degradation is low this may be due to the fact that under highly acidic conditions sno2 nps may get agglomerated thus reducing the surface area accessible for photodegradation process 3 6 comparative study of photodegradation of cbz by sc1 and ss1 nanoparticles the comparative degradation histogram of the cbz in the absence of catalyst as well as presence of both the sc1 and ss1 photocatalyst respectively are shown in fig s1 of esi to determine the comparative photocatalytic activity sno2 nanoparticles 0 5 g l of sno2 nps sc1 and ss1 respectively were dispersed in 200 ml of 5 ppm aqueous solutions cbz separately in two 500 ml conical flask and were kept in continuous stirring the solution mixture was kept in the dark under with continuous stirring for 1 h for the adsorption desorption equilibrium study in both the suspension no degradation was observed in the absence of uv c light after the completion of 1 h in the dark the solution was kept inside uv c photoreactor for another 1 h in order to study the degradation process of the drug molecule the variations in the adsorption of uv spectra of cbz solution due to degradation of the drug molecules were noted at a regular interval of time the same procedure was followed with a blank solution of cbz no variation of the band in the uv spectra of cbz was observed the uv vis absorption spectra of cbz solutions in the presence of sno2 nanoparticles sc1 and ss1 are shown in fig 10 a and b in the course of the photodegradation process of cbz drug solutions the intensity of the characteristic band at 285 nm decreases with the increase the contact time of irradiation signifying the fast degradation of cbz molecules it was observed that after 60 min the peak around 285 nm becomes almost flat in both the cases i e in presence of sc1 and ss1 as photocatalyst which indicates the complete degradation of cbz in the solution to study the catalytic activity of both the synthesized photocatalyst sc1 and ss1 the kinetics of the degradation cbz drug molecule were determined respectively it shows that it follows the pseudo first order kinetic model in both the cases which are represented using the following langmuir hinshelwood equation 4 ln c0 c kt where k is the rate constant co and c are absorbance or concentration before and after photodegradation of drug molecule respectively from equation 4 rate constant of both sc1 and ss1 can be determined by applying linear correlation the plots ln c0 c versus irradiation time t in the presence of sc1 and ss1 are shown in fig 10 c therefore the rate constant k min 1 for the degradation of cbz was calculated and found be 6 6 10 2 min 1 and 5 7 10 2 min 1 in presence of sc1 and ss1 respectively here to evaluate the kinetics of the degradation cbz drug decrease in the absorption peak at 285 nm was taken into account as no other new characteristic peaks were observed during the progress of degradation process karpinska et al 2015 this was validated from literature where it is reported that the data acquired by hplc method of the degraded solution of cbz showed formation of no new peaks due to transformation products karpinska et al 2015 pereira et al 2007 further from fig 10 d it was found that the percentage efficiency of degradation of cbz drug solution in presence of sc1 is 97 and in presence of ss1 is 92 so from all the above comparative studies it can be concluded that the sno2 nps synthesized using ctab as a surfactant sc1 shows better results as compared to the sno2 nps synthesized using sds as a surfactant therefore we can say that the sno2 nps synthesized using ctab as surfactant is a better alternative in the removal of cbz drug from wastewater 3 7 mechanism of photodegradation of cbz by sno2 nanoparticles under uv c light the residual cbz concentration in aqueous samples was first analyzed using uv vis spectrophotometry to measure the intensity change of the maximum absorbance peak at 285 nm a probable sno2 photocatalytic mechanism is shown in scheme 1 on irradiation of uv c light on the surface of sno2 nps an electron hole pair is generated eq 5 prakash et al 2016 the photogenerated electrons move from the valence band vb to the conduction band cb of photocatalyst and thereby facilitating oxygen reduction eq 6 kim et al 2016 the water molecule present on the surface of the sno2 nps captures the h and produces primarily hydroxyl radical oh eq 7 abdelkader et al 2016 the e on the conduction band reacts with oxygen radical and h produces hydrogen peroxide eq 8 wanga et al 2016 thereby cbz possibly will be reacted to different intermediates contacting with oh h o2 and hydrogen peroxide bo et al 2017 the photocatalytic degradation mechanism of cbz can be proposed as follows as in scheme 2 scheme 2 photodegradation of cbz may be directly attributed to the attack of oh resulting in the hydroxylation of either the double bond or the aromatic rings of cbz which is a major path for degradation of organic molecules sun et al 2013 the schematic representation of the degradation of cbz in presence of sc1 and ss1 is shown in fig 11 3 8 determination of probable transformation products formed during the photodegradation of cbz to study the transformation product of cbz in photodegradation process lcms was recorded using 410 prostar binary lc with 500 ms it pda detectors from the scan range of 1 690 m z to determine the probable formation of transformation product from cbz lcms analysis of the degradation solution was carried out multiple scanning of the degraded cbz solution were done in order to acquire all possible signals of intermediate products formed during photodegradation of cbz from the signal obtained from lcms analysis the m z values were observed and the possible product formation is deduced as shown in table 1 fig s2 a e of esi depicts the lcms data obtained at five scanning at three different interval of irradiation time fig s2 gives the signal of the first scan of the degraded solution that was run initially after 5 min of uv c degradation in presence of sno2 nps to determine the initial possible degradation products after that three more scans of the degraded cbz solution after 30 min of irradiation was run as shown in fig s2 b d here these three lc ms scans were run because in one scanning we may not get all the signal of the intermediates formed so two more scans were run in order to get more accuracy finally one final scanning fig s2e was done after 1 h that is on the completion of the degradation process in order to determine the lc ms signals of possible final transformation products from the lcms data the signal at m z 236 02 may be due to the parent compound cbz as shown in fig s2 a daniele et al 2017 the signal at m z 252 3 as shown in fig s2 c and d may be due to the formation of 10 11 epoxycarbamazepine which may formed through a hydration process miao and metcalfe 2003 from the literature it is found to be one of the common degradation products of cbz deng et al 2013 additionally the signals at m z 252 3 fig s2 c and d also indicates the formation of 10 1 aminovinyl 10 10 dihydroacridine 9 carbaldehyde from the epoxy bond cleavage of the 10 11 epoxcarbamazepine daniele et al 2017 again in fig s2 a and b the signal observed at m z 267 5 can be assigned to 1 1 bis 2 formylphenyl urea which might formed by the cleavage of azepine ring of 10 11 epoxcarbamazepine deng et al 2013 this product so formed may further oxidize and forms carboxylic compounds 2 2 carbamoylazanediyl dibenzoic acid whose lcms signal is observed at m z 301 in fig s2 a and d and 2 1 2 formylphenyl ureido benzoic acid at m z 285 2 by losing conh2 group as shown in fig s2 a and d deng et al 2013 hu et al 2009 the signal at m z 179 3 as depicted in fig s2 b is due to the formation of acridine daniele et al 2017 its formation might take place by the ring contraction of 10 11 epoxycarbamazepine which leads to the formation of acridine 9 carbaldehyde as observed in fig s2 b at m z 208 4 again loss of cho group from acridine 9 carbaldehyde results in acridine formation kosjek et al 2009 acridine is one of the most common photodegradation products of cbz reported in all the literature calisto et al 2011 acridine further transforms into acridin 9 10h one which is observed at m z 195 of fig s2 c daniele et al 2017 the transformation products 2 2 carbamoylazanediyl dibenzoic acid and 2 1 2 formylphenyl ureido benzoic acid may further lose functional groups like conh2 cho and co or combines to hydroxy group to produce compounds like 2 aminobenzoic acid and 2 hydroxybenzoic acid on hydroxidation whose signals were observed in fig s2 c at m z 139 3 and 138 3 vogna et al 2004 further the signal observed in fig s2 b at m z 105 and 151 2 may be ascribed to the formation of benzaldehyde and an acidic aromatic intermediate 2 formylbenzoic acid bo et al 2017 lcms data of the completed degraded solution as shown in fig s2 e shows signals at m z 132 16 116 2 and 74 04 which may be because of the formation of short chain aliphatic acids like 4 hydroxy 2 3 dioxobutanoic acid maleic acid fumaric acid and propionic acid generated on the complete cleavage of the benzene ring bo et al 2017 a probable mechanistic path is deduced based on all the m z values obtain from lcms of photodegradation solution of cbz fig 12 3 9 recyclability of prepared nanoparticles the recyclability of the photocatalyst is an essential part of the photodegradation process to estimate the stability and efficiency of the prepared sno2 photocatalyst the recovered catalyst was reused again for the degradation of cbz solution this process as repeatedly studied for 8 times and was found that no noteworthy decrease of photocatalytic activity of prepared sno2 nps was observed an in appreciable loss of photocatalytic activity was observed after the fifth cycle of the photodegradation process as shown in fig s3 of esi this minute loss in photocatalytic activity may be due to inaccessibility of surface site on synthesized sno2 nps after the 5th cycle hence we can say that the prepared sno2 nps is an excellent reusable photocatalyst and could be used up to 8 cycles for the photodegradation of cbz molecules to determine the crystallinity and morphological changes of the prepared sno2photocatalyst tem and xrd analysis were done before and after degradation of cbz fig s4 as shown in esi represents the tem images of sc1 and ss1 after photodegradation of cbz on comparing the tem images of sc1 and ss1 nanocatalyst before and after photocatalysis no characteristic change in morphology was found nor was any kind of agglomeration observed fig s4b shows the xrd patterns of sc1 and ss1 nanoparticles after degradation of cbz no significant changes in crystallinity were observed in the xrd pattern of sc1 and ss1 nanoparticles before and after photodegradation all the crystallographic planes of sc1 and ss1 nanoparticles after degradation remain same as that of before photocatalysis 4 conclusion in conclusion it is found that sno2 nanoparticles were efficaciously synthesized employing a simple chemical precipitation method using aspartic acid anhydrous and surfactant such as ctab and sds from the comparative study of all the characterization it is found that the size of the particles can be tuned by changing the surfactants and increasing annealing temperature it is confirmed from tem images and xrd patterns that the sno2 nps synthesized with cationic surfactant ctab sc1 and sc2 forms smaller sized nanoparticles 8 and 13 5 nm than that of the nanoparticles synthesized with anionic surfactant sds ss1 and ss2 with sizes of 9 5 and 15 5 nm respectively it also confirms that all the sno2 nps synthesized both with ctab and sds by this method forms spherical in shape tetragonal rutile structure and polycrystalline nature again from the tem images and xrd it showed that the sno2 nanoparticles sc1 and ss1 synthesized at a lower annealing temperature at 300 c forms average sizes of 8 and 9 5 and higher annealing temperature at 600 c forms average particle sizes of 13 5 and 15 5 nm respectively therefore it is manifest that annealing temperature also plays a great role in controlling the size of the particles as increasing the annealing temperature the size of the sno2 nps increases from the band gap energy study it is found that in case of smaller size of the sno2 nps sc1 and ss1 which shows band gap energy 4 08 and 4 0 ev which is higher as compared with the greater sized sno2 nps sc2 and ss2 which is about 3 95 and 3 9 ev respectively due to the quantum confinement effects blue shift in band gap energy is observed therefore it can be marked from all the above observation that the size of the nanoparticles depends on the annealing temperature it is also observed that the band gap energy depends on the size of the synthesized sno2 nps the photocatalytic activity study on the photodegradation of cbz drug showed that synthesized sc1 and ss1 nps can degrade 97 and 92 respectively within 60 min under uv c light the kinetic study confirms that the rate constant for sc1 is 6 66 10 2 min 1 which is higher than the rate constant of ss1 5 7 10 2 min 1 from all the comparative study it is found that sno2 nps synthesized with ctab shows better photocatalytic activity than the sno2 np synthesized with sds from the lcms analysis it was found the photodegradation of cbz results in the formation of various transformation products lcms analysis of the complete degradation of cbz solution shows the formation of four different short chain aliphatic acids the reusability study of the synthesized sno2 nps sc1 and ss1 shows that it can run up to 8 cycles without affecting its structural and morphological properties further it is confirmed

19861,little is known about the forces that determine the assembly of diverse bacterial communities inhabiting drinking water treatment filters and how this affects drinking water quality two contrasting ecological theories can help to understand how natural microbial communities assemble niche theory and neutral theory where environmental deterministic factors or stochastic factors predominate respectively this study investigates the development of the microbial community on two common contrasting filter materials quartz sand and granular activated carbon gac to elucidate the main factors governing their assembly through the evaluation of environmental i e filter medium type and stochastic forces random deaths births and immigration laboratory scale filter columns were used to mimic a rapid gravity filter the microbiome of the filter materials and of the filter influent and effluent was characterised using next generation 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and flow cytometry chemical parameters i e dissolved organic carbon trihalomethanes formation were also monitored to assess the final effluent quality the filter communities seemed to be strongly assembled by selection rather than neutral processes with only 28 of those otus shared with the source water detected on the filter medium following predictions using a neutral community model gac hosted a phylogenetically more diverse community than sand the two filter media communities seeded the effluent water triggering differences in both water quality and community composition of the effluents overall gac proved to be better than sand in controlling microbial growth by promoting higher bacterial decay rates and hosting less bacterial cells and showed better performance for putative pathogen

present with high abundance in drinking water treatment systems not only in source waters 105 106 cells ml hammes et al 2008 lautenschlager et al 2014 and at different points of a drinking water treatment plant dwtp 105 cells ml hammes et al 2008 vital et al 2012 but also in the distribution networks 104 105 cells ml hammes et al 2008 lautenschlager et al 2013 modern dwtps employ multi step treatment processes to bring source water up to acceptable drinking water standards among them filters are widely used due to their high performance in removing fine solids and soluble organic matter their low energy consumption and low maintenance requirements water filters are populated by a high diversity of bacteria pinto et al 2012 which may contribute in the removal of contaminants such as dissolved organic carbon doc nitrogen and micropollutants richter et al 2008 or might play a detrimental role by harbouring potential pathogens or releasing doc with a subsequent increase in trihalomethane thm formation moreover water filters have a significant influence on the bacterial community composition in the post filtration water and distribution network pinto et al 2012 nevertheless little is known about how water treatment bacterial communities assemble what forces determine their structure in water filters and how this affects their functions such as the quality of the final drinking water in water treatment processes better identification of these forces provides a challenging opportunity to optimise dwtps performance two contrasting ecological theories explain how natural microbial communities assemble the traditional niche based theory ramette and tiedje 2007 tilman 1982 and the unified neutral theory of biodiversity hubbell 2005 2001 such as the neutral community model ncm sloan et al 2006 according to traditional niche based theory microbial communities are shaped by deterministic factors such as competition and niche differentiation sloan et al 2006 creating a strong link between microbial population traits and the specific environment in which they grow the controversial neutral theories break the link between microbial population composition and environment identifying stochastic factors such as death birth immigration and speciation as the main drivers for microbial assembly hubbell 2005 the neutral theory has been cast as a simple mathematical model with a small number of parameters and has been able to describe the structure species abundance distribution and species area relationships of a wide range of micro and macro communities volkov et al 2007 from fish muneepeerakul et al 2008 and beetles ulrich and zalewski 2007 to some natural microbial communities sloan et al 2006 however despite being successful in describing some ecological patterns stochastic factors alone cannot always explain all the variation observed in complex microbial communities in which case a combination of the two types of factors stochastic and environmental seem more effective in describing complex realities ofiteru et al 2010 stegen et al 2012 in this study we investigated the development of microbial communities on two drinking water filter materials quartz sand and granular activated carbon receiving the same source water in laboratory scale columns the ncm was used as a null model and employed to test how much of the variation in the filter microbial communities could be described by neutral stochastic processes of random deaths births within the local community and immigration from the same metacommunity if neutral processes were predominant in the assembly of lab scale filter communities a good agreement between the model predictions and the experimental data would be found on the other hand any deviations from the model assumptions expressed by a poor agreement would represent the predominance of deterministic forces over stochastic processes induced by the filtration process itself or by the presence of two contrasting filtering materials in addition we assessed what effect the different filter media and their respective communities had on the function of the water filters including doc removal potential thm formation and putative pathogen removal 2 methods 2 1 columns set up and operation the biological community developing on two different filter materials quartz sand sigma aldrich germany and granular activated carbon gac activated charcoal untreated granular sigma aldrich germany was studied by employing a suite of four lab scale columns two replicates for each filter

compared by non metric multidimensional scaling nmds principal coordinate analysis pco and cluster analysis of bray curtis similarities chase et al 2011 quantitative pcr qpcr was used to quantify the number of bacterial cells present on the filter medium samples the 338f bakke et al 2011 and 1046r huber et al 2009 primers were used to target the 16s rrna gene assuming that each organism in our microbial community contained one copy of the gene qpcr assays were performed on a cfx96 real time pcr detection system bio rad united kingdom using the following temperature profile 98 c for 3 min

standards in concentration ranging between 102 and 108 fragment copies per μl were obtained from circular plasmids containing the target fragment of dna and a calibration curve was generated in every qpcr run melt curve analysis between 65 and 95 c was performed at the end of each qpcr run to assess the specificity of the products the average efficiency of the qpcr analyses was 95 2 5 ecological analyses a modified version of the neutral community model morris et al 2013 sloan et al 2006 was used to identify otus present in the target communities i e the local filter communities as the effect of neutral stochastic processes of random deaths and births within the local communities and stochastic immigration from the metacommunity the ncm was therefore used as a null model compliance with which would be indicative that neutral stochastic processes predominate in community assembly in lab scale water filters and differences from which would be indicative of deterministic processes predominating the composition of the metacommunity was inferred by averaging the composition of the influent water samples at both sampling points t0 and t56 as proposed by morris et al 2013 in their application of the ncm in order to include the highest number of filter colonisers in the analysis the samples employed to represent the local target communities were those collected in duplicate from the top and bot portions of the four filter columns the frequency of detection was expressed as the number of filter material samples where a specific otu was detected over the total number of filter samples a further analysis was conducted where the filter media samples were considered as source communities and employed to infer the metacommunity composition and the filter effluent samples collected in duplicate at t56 as the local target communities only the otus shared between source and target communities were employed for the analyses the model uses 95 binomial confidence intervals using the hmsic package in r morris et al 2013 and otus falling between these intervals were considered to be present as a result of neutral stochastic processes of random births and deaths within the local communities and stochastic immigration from the source community influent water or filter medium therefore following neutrality otus that fell outside the upper bound of the confidence interval were those characterised by higher frequencies of detection in the local target communities filter medium or effluent water than predicted by the neutral model based on their abundance in the source otus that fell outside the lower bound of the confidence interval were those detected less frequently in the local target communities than predicted by the ncm any deviation from the model upper and lower bound of the confidence interval would represent the predominance of non neutral processes such as environmental selection and competition and would account for those taxa that are advantaged or disadvantaged by the local community environment the best fit of the model with the data was found by calibrating the coupled parameter n t m where m is the immigration rate and n t is the total number of individuals in the local community that was considered stable after 56 days of filter operation the phylogenetic community structure was also characterised using the mean nearest taxon distance mntd and the nearest taxon index nti as described in stegen et al 2012 mntd finds the phylogenetic distance between each otu within a sample and its closest relative in the same sample therefore it measures how phylogenetically close the taxa in a community are related to each other very low mntd values are typical of communities composed of taxa that are highly related and therefore indicative of those communities where environmental selection has overcome stochastic assembly stegen et al 2012 nti quantifies the number of standard deviations that the observed community mntd is from the mean of a null distribution nti greater than 2 indicates a community whose taxa are more closely related than expected by chance whereas an nti less than 2 are indicative of communities where coexisting taxa are more distantly related than expected by chance this method has shown to successfully distinguish niche based assembled local communities from neutrally assembled ones by dispersal using simulated metacommunities kembel 2009 we employed this test to evaluate how much selection has impacted the assembly of our communities over and above stochastic forces average nti values were assigned to sand and gac filters employing the duplicates samples from top and bot portions 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of neutral processes on microbial assembly we observed that the neutral community model accounted for only 28 measured as pearson coefficient p 6 2 10 11 confidence intervals 0 19 1 38 of the observed variation in the frequency of otus as predicted by their relative abundance in the influent water indeed the majority of the taxa employed in the ncm analyses the ones shared between influent water and filter media communities 54 were either more frequent 24 of taxa or less frequent 30 of taxa than would be expected by their relative abundances if they were assembled by neutral stochastic processes alone table 1 fig 2 a this suggests that neutral forces can at best only explain a small part of the microbial assembly and that deterministic forces are predominant in the system if the assembly of the microbial community in the two filter media were neutral rather than determined by environmental selection in the filter the mean relative abundance of each otu in the influent would dictate the frequency with which that otu is detected in the filter regardless the filter medium type therefore plotting the relative abundance of otus in the influent water against the detection frequency of otus in the filter would result in a continuous monotonically increasing curve converging to 100 fig 2 other studies have assessed the consistency of the neutral theory with the assembly of natural microbial communities a study on the microbial composition of lung communities showed a much higher correlation between the model prediction and the empirical observations than that observed by us spearman rank correlation 0 84 morris et al 2013 nevertheless it seems that the correlation we observed is comparable to that in another engineered system activated sludge where the neutral community model could account for 20 of the variability measured as r2 of the heterotroph community ofiteru et al 2010 moreover the microbial communities observed on the filter media of our lab scale filters showed a composition of taxa more phylogenetically related than expected if they were stochastically assembled nti greater than 2 therefore the filtration process itself for our specific conditions and at a laboratory scale exerted a strong selective effect within the 56 days of our study if we assume that all the taxa must have originated from the source community among the filtration processes we studied a further level of selection was posed by the presence of two contrasting materials it appeared that sand exerted a higher environmental pressure than gac selecting for a phylogenetically closer community the mean sand nti observed was significantly higher than the mean gac nti 8 41 and 7 16 respectively t test p 0 013 table si1 in total 683 otus were detected among influent and filter media samples 503 otus were detected on the filter material while 588 otus were detected in the filter influent samples 408 were shared between the source and the filter community and were employed in the model only 46 of the shared otus equal to 37 of the total otus detected in the filter media fell in the neutral region constructed with the 95 binomial confidence intervals table 1 fig 2a the same analysis was performed on the effluent communities this time considering the filter material as a source of dispersal here we observed that the effect of neutral stochastic processes on the community assembly was more pronounced indeed the model was able to describe 50 pearson coefficient p 5 7 10 11 confidence interval 0 37 0 65 of the observed variation in the community fig 2b however 35 of taxa were either more frequent 12 or less frequent 23 than would be expected by their relative abundances if neutral processes alone had assembled them the improved fit with neutrality reflects the stochastic nature of the filtration process itself water flows through the filter sloughing off part of the community that has developed on the filter material and what is present in higher abundance on the filter is then found in higher frequency in the effluent water sloan et al 2006 among the 631 otus detected between filter media and effluent water 611 were detected in the effluent and 503 on the filter media 483 were shared between filter media and effluent water table 1 almost all the otus present on the filter media were detected in the effluent water except 20 which confirms that the filter community seeds the effluent water pinto et al 2012 however 128 otus that were present in the filter effluent were not detected on the filter samples these otus that were passing through pinto et al 2012 the filter were originally present in the influent water but were unable to colonise it they represented 21 of the total otus detected in the effluent these findings suggest that filter communities are not strongly assembled by neutral processes and that the filtration process generates a selective environment where deterministic forces overcome stochastic ones within 56 days of operation dini andreote et al 2015 3 2 the effect of filter medium type on microbial communities in the filters communities that developed on the surface of the two different materials showed significant differences in their similarity anosim global r 0 976 and p 0 1 different samples from the two replicates tended to cluster according to the material on which they developed fig 3 such clustering seems likely to be the result of the different properties of the two types of materials used such as intraparticle porosity surface area chemistry and adsorption capacity furthermore it must be noted that the particle sizes of the two different materials though similar were more varied for gac than sand in more detail planctomyces was the most abundant genus on sand filters sand representing 11 and 13 of the top top and bottom bot communities followed by gemmata at 8 1 top and 1 3 bot and by two other taxa whose genera were not assigned from the pirellulaceae and saprospiraceae families the two otus with the highest relative abundance on gac filters were unidentified beyond the class level a gammaproteobacteria constituted 5 6 and 6 2 of the top and bot gac communities and an unknown bacteria constituted 5 3 and 5 2 of the two communities those otus that contributed the most to the dissimilarity between the two filter communities were identified using the simper similarity percentages analysis in primer these were taxa of the genus planctomyces and gemmata that were detected with a high relative abundance on both materials but with higher values observed in sand rather than in gac in addition species belonging to the genus of gordonia sulfuritalea and nitrospira were identified as main contributors and were detected in very low abundances on gac but with higher abundances in sand two other taxa one belonging to the genus hydrogenophaga and the other to the family opitutaceae were detected mainly in gac columns in a previous study hydrogenophaga related bacteria were one of the most predominant bacteria isolated from different gac filters sampled in the netherlands magic knezev et al 2009 3 3 the effect of filter medium type on microbial communities in the effluent water influent and effluent water samples differed significantly over time and between filter media two way crossed anosim global r 1 and 0 998 respectively p 0 001 for both factors the influent communities at t0 and at t56 showed 53 similarity indicating a change of the feeding water between these sampling times fig 4 a among the effluent samples the bacterial community seemed to cluster according to the filter material samples of the two physical replicates for each filter material clustered together with a similarity of 85 for both sand and gac at t0 and 75 at t56 permanova analyses showed that both filter influent microbial composition and filter material influenced the microbial composition of the effluent water p 0 001 for both factors however the influent water microbial composition seems to be the main contributing factor according to principal component analysis influent water explained 60 8 of the total variation fig 4b while the filter medium type explained 14 of the effluent water composition variation in microbial community similarities the similarity between influent and effluent water communities decreased from the beginning to the end of the experiment from 70 at t0 to 65 at t56 the 30 dissimilarity between influent and effluent water at t0 can only be explained as a direct result of the filtration process where microorganisms in the influent water were removed from the water during the passage through the filter since no other microorganisms were present on the two media at the beginning of the experiment the slight dissimilarity between the two effluent types at this stage of the experiment 15 is probably the result of different porosity created by the two materials due to different grain structures at the end of the experiment the similarity between influent and effluent decreased along with the similarity between the effluents from the two different filter media from 70 to 65 and from 80 to 75 respectively fig 4a in this case the presence of established microbial communities on the filter material might explain the increase of both dissimilarities part of the community developed on the filter seeds the effluent water thereby affecting its composition indeed some of the taxa whose concentration increased from influent to effluent water were those enriched in the filter environment moreover the most abundant bacteria detected in the influent water samples belonged to the class of actinobacteria 15 and 33 at t0 and t56 flavobacteria 24 and 11 at t0 and t56 and betaproteobacteria 30 and 10 at t0 and t56 planctomycetia 12 gac 26 sand alphaproteobacteria 17 gac 12 sand and gammaproteobacteria 9 gac 4 sand were the most abundant classes found on the filter biofilm previous studies have observed that certain species inhabiting freshwater have higher capacity to attach to surfaces and survive in biofilms while others mostly survive in a planktonic state douterelo et al 2013 in freshwater ecosystems flavobacteria often lives in an entirely planktonic state growing on specific algal exudates zeder et al 2009 this would explain the high relative abundance of those bacteria classes in the influent water and their very low abundance on biofilm less than 1 3 4 implications for water quality cell removal suspended cells were removed from the influent water through the columns fig 5 a sand and gac removed the same concentration of cells no statistically significant difference was observed between the two effluents at each sampling time paired t test p value 0 172 both materials removed on average 66 9 of the cells entering the columns however the concentration of cells detected on the columns at the end of the experiment differed between the two materials gac hosted less cells per cm3 than sand despite having a higher specific surface area and a rougher structure that would allow a better cells colonisation in total 4 91 0 48 109 cells cm3 and 2 90 0 20 109 cells cm3 colonised sand and gac respectively fig 5b which is in the same range as previously measured cell concentrations in drinking water biofilters lautenschlager et al 2014 velten et al 2007 we also calculated that during the whole duration of the experiment 1 42 1011 cells entered the columns and 4 51 1010 left the system therefore 9 66 1010 cells were either retained in the columns or removed from the system a total of 3 75 0 64 1010 cells colonised the sand columns at the end of the experiment while 2 22 0 30 1010 cells colonised the gac columns suggesting that in both materials cell decay is an important removal mechanism this net decay was higher in gac a minimum of 7 74 109 cells ignoring cell growth on doc as compared to sand a minimum of 5 62 109 cells this analysis demonstrates that cell removal from the influent water is not merely due to physicochemical entrapment and screening out of cells by the filter material but also involves cell lysis or predation by heterotrophic nano flagellates note that the cell decay could in reality be even higher than calculated since we did not consider cell growth in our cell number balance the gac adsorption capacity was very high at the beginning of the experiment in fact almost 40 of the doc present in the water was removed reducing the amount of doc available in the water for microbial growth this might lead to higher cell decay in the filters and to the lower colonisation of gac on both materials more cells were measured on the top of the columns rather than the bottom fig 5b this was most likely due to higher readily biodegradable substrate availability in this region a stratification already observed in previous studies lautenschlager et al 2014 velten et al 2011 and from the decay of cells filtered onto the columns from the influent the higher amount of cells detected on the top positions of the filters can be linked with the higher observed alpha biodiversity in fact while no differences in terms of alpha biodiversity were observed between the two materials on both materials a higher diversity was observed at the top positions table si2 of supplementary information 3 5 implications for water quality putative pathogens and faecal indicators six main genera that harbour putative pathogens and faecal indicators were identified in the influent and effluent water collected at t56 and on the filter material mycobacterium aeromonas clostridium legionella enterobacter and flavobacterium from here on described as putative pathogens the relative abundances of those genera were multiplied by the total cell concentrations measured using flow cytometry expressed in cells ml or qpcr in order to estimate the final total abundances fig 6 a fig 6b the concentrations of those genera harbouring putative pathogens in the influent water were significantly higher than the concentrations in the effluent water t test p 0 02 except for legionella whose concentration increased from influent to effluent t test p 0 006 and was found significantly higher in sand effluent t test p 0 007 the concentration of mycobacterium clostridium and flavobacterium cells were significantly lower in sand effluent t test p 0 04 than in gac effluent and no significant difference was observed between the two effluent types for enterobacter cells only mycobacterium clostridium legionella and flavobacterium were detected on the filter media mycobacterium cells were found at significantly higher abundance on sand columns in both top and bottom positions t test p 0 02 clostridium cells were detected only in the top positions of the columns in both materials but no significant difference was detected between the two media legionella cells were detected on both media in both positions with a significant higher abundance of cells on the bottom position of sand columns t test p 0 015 finally flavobacterium cells were detected on both materials in both positions but no significant difference was detected between the two materials the absence or their presence at abundances lower than detection limits of aeromonas and enterobacter cells on filter material agrees with previous studies showing poor survival of those bacteria in drinking water biofilm kwon et al 2011 lehtola et al 2007 the filtration process is confirmed as an effective treatment for ensuring a two log reduction of faecal indicators from the influent water over 27 cm total filter depth regardless of the material employed to explain the observed two log reduction between influent and effluent for these passing through bacteria which were absent from the filter biofilm community we estimated very high decay rates equal to 12 0 h 1 for aeromonas in both filter materials and 8 11 h 1 and 11 7 h 1 for enterobacter in sand and gac respectively while aeromonas and enterobacter cells seem to act as taxa that pass through and or decay the rest of the putative pathogens identified colonised the filter in the case of legionella this led to a net cell growth with significant release of cells into the effluent water resulting in increased number of legionella cells compared to the influent species of mycobacterium and legionella have been detected in several drinking water biofilms and a previous study has found that these bacteria are able to accumulate in biofilms even under high shear turbulent flow conditions lehtola et al 2007 the distinct behaviour of different genera harbouring putative pathogens in the water filtration process which tends to shape communities in distribution networks demonstrates a need for more comprehensive characterisation and monitoring of the drinking water microbiome it must also be acknowledged that further research would be necessary to confirm the identity of the taxa identified in this study and referred to as putative pathogens as true pathogens and check their viability 3 6 implications for chemical water quality doc removal and thm formation potential doc removal differed between gac and sand packed columns fig 7 a in gac columns removal started high at 40 due to doc adsorption but dropped after 19 days stabilising at an average of 15 the stable doc removal from day 25 onwards is most likely due to biological activity compared to the chemical physical adsorption that occurred in the first 25 days in sand columns no significant doc removal was recorded in the first 20 days while it progressively increased reaching an average of 9 in the following 36 days which as in the gac columns could likely be attributed to biology velten et al 2011 the difference in doc removal efficiency was also reflected in the thm formation potential of the filter effluents which was 277 9 16 3 μg thms l for sand and 188 8 14 1 μg thms l for the gac columns at 23 h chlorine contact time the organic matter present in water is known to be the main contributor to the formation of several classes of undesirable disinfection by products where thms are the most prevalent the thm formation potential thmfp increases with the concentration of doc present in water ramavandi et al 2015 it was therefore not unexpected that a higher concentration of thms would occur in the sand column effluent where the doc removal was slightly less effective however the amount of thms normalised to the quantity of doc present in the water was at any of the three different chlorine contact times still much higher for sand column effluent than for gac fig 7b it can be inferred that the two materials preferentially removed different fractions of doc with gac being more effective in removing the doc fractions that are responsible for the highest amount of thm produced it has been demonstrated that the chemical characteristics of dissolved organic matter influences the formation of disinfection by products specific doc fractions were found to have a higher thmfp than others ramavandi et al 2015 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 since doc is partially biodegradable selective doc removal by the two filter media would also create two different environmental conditions for the filter colonizing microorganisms whether the preferential removal of thm precursors in gac columns was only due to chemical adsorption or to the combination of chemical activity and biological degradation was not evaluated further studies are required to assess reliably how the different microbial communities of the two filter media distinctly degrade such compounds 4 conclusions this is the first study that investigates the role played by neutral and deterministic factors in the assembly of filter microbial communities in a controlled setting the assembly of lab scale water filter communities is only weakly influenced by neutral processes the filtration process itself exerts an environmental pressure and between the two materials investigated sand selected for communities more phylogenetically closely related than gac two different communities developed on the two materials triggered a difference between the two effluent communities and affecting the overall quality of the effluent water higher abundance of legionella was found on the sand grains resulting in a significantly higher concentration of legionella cells in the sand effluent compared to gac this suggests that such material could preferentially be used to control legionella released in the distribution network the different putative pathogens showed very distinct behaviours suggesting that traditional faecal indicator bacteria such as e coli may not adequately represent other pathogens such as mycobacterium avium and legionella pneumophila in water treatment overall this study has showed that the filter medium is a deterministic factor that can drive the assembly of different microbial communities resulting in the improvement or deterioration of effluent water quality this raises the exciting opportunity that such filter communities could be

19861,little is known about the forces that determine the assembly of diverse bacterial communities inhabiting drinking water treatment filters and how this affects drinking water quality two contrasting ecological theories can help to understand how natural microbial communities assemble niche theory and neutral theory where environmental deterministic factors or stochastic factors predominate respectively this study investigates the development of the microbial community on two common contrasting filter materials quartz sand and granular activated carbon gac to elucidate the main factors governing their assembly through the evaluation of environmental i e filter medium type and stochastic forces random deaths births and immigration laboratory scale filter columns were used to mimic a rapid gravity filter the microbiome of the filter materials and of the filter influent and effluent was characterised using next generation 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and flow cytometry chemical parameters i e dissolved organic carbon trihalomethanes formation were also monitored to assess the final effluent quality the filter communities seemed to be strongly assembled by selection rather than neutral processes with only 28 of those otus shared with the source water detected on the filter medium following predictions using a neutral community model gac hosted a phylogenetically more diverse community than sand the two filter media communities seeded the effluent water triggering differences in both water quality and community composition of the effluents overall gac proved to be better than sand in controlling microbial growth by promoting higher bacterial decay rates and hosting less bacterial cells and showed better performance for putative pathogen control by leaking less legionella cells into the effluent water graphical abstract image 1 keywords neutral model microbial ecology water filter drinking water quality abbreviations doc dissolved

present with high abundance in drinking water treatment systems not only in source waters 105 106 cells ml hammes et al 2008 lautenschlager et al 2014 and at different points of a drinking water treatment plant dwtp 105 cells ml hammes et al 2008 vital et al 2012 but also in the distribution networks 104 105 cells ml hammes et al 2008 lautenschlager et al 2013 modern dwtps employ multi step treatment processes to bring source water up to acceptable drinking water standards among them filters are widely used due to their high performance in removing fine solids and soluble organic matter their low energy consumption and low maintenance requirements water filters are populated by a high diversity of bacteria pinto et al 2012 which may contribute in the removal of contaminants such as dissolved organic carbon doc nitrogen and micropollutants richter et al 2008 or might play a detrimental role by harbouring potential pathogens or releasing doc with a subsequent increase in trihalomethane thm formation moreover water filters have a significant influence on the bacterial community composition in the post filtration water and distribution network pinto et al 2012 nevertheless little is known about how water treatment bacterial communities assemble what forces determine their structure in water filters and how this affects their functions such as the quality of the final drinking water in water treatment processes better identification of these forces provides a challenging opportunity to optimise dwtps performance two contrasting ecological theories explain how natural microbial communities assemble the traditional niche based theory ramette and tiedje 2007 tilman 1982 and the unified neutral theory of biodiversity hubbell 2005 2001 such as the neutral community model ncm sloan et al 2006 according to traditional niche based theory microbial communities are shaped by deterministic factors such as competition and niche differentiation sloan et al 2006 creating a strong link between microbial population traits and the specific environment in which they grow the controversial neutral theories break the link between microbial population composition and environment identifying stochastic factors such as death birth immigration and speciation as the main drivers for microbial assembly hubbell 2005 the neutral theory has been cast as a simple mathematical model with a small number of parameters and has been able to describe the structure species abundance distribution and species area relationships of a wide range of micro and macro communities volkov et al 2007 from fish muneepeerakul et al 2008 and beetles ulrich and zalewski 2007 to some natural microbial communities sloan et al 2006 however despite being successful in describing some ecological patterns stochastic factors alone cannot always explain all the variation observed in complex microbial communities in which case a combination of the two types of factors stochastic and environmental seem more effective in describing complex realities ofiteru et al 2010 stegen et al 2012 in this study we investigated the development of microbial communities on two drinking water filter materials quartz sand and granular activated carbon receiving the same source water in laboratory scale columns the ncm was used as a null model and employed to test how much of the variation in the filter microbial communities could be described by neutral stochastic processes of random deaths births within the local community and immigration from the same metacommunity if neutral processes were predominant in the assembly of lab scale filter communities a good agreement between the model predictions and the experimental data would be found on the other hand any deviations from the model assumptions expressed by a poor agreement would represent the predominance of deterministic forces over stochastic processes induced by the filtration process itself or by the presence of two contrasting filtering materials in addition we assessed what effect the different filter media and their respective communities had on the function of the water filters including doc removal potential thm formation and putative pathogen removal 2 methods 2 1 columns set up and operation the biological community developing on two different filter materials quartz sand sigma aldrich germany and granular activated carbon gac activated charcoal untreated granular sigma aldrich germany was studied by employing a suite of four lab scale columns two replicates for each filter media the filters consisted of stainless steel 30 cm columns with 0 6 cm inner diameter columns were packed with clean and autoclaved filter material 3 6 g of gac and 15 g of sand to obtain a filter depth of 27 cm fig 1 particle size ranged from 0 25 mm to 0 84 mm for gac and from 0 21 mm to 0 29 mm for sand the columns were operated for 56 days 5280 empty bed volumes at room temperature 21 9 2 c according to previous literature this period of time was considered sufficient to ensure the development of a stable biofilm through the whole length of the filter as suggested by the steady state

analyses a modified version of the neutral community model morris et al 2013 sloan et al 2006 was used to identify otus present in the target communities i e the local filter communities as the effect of neutral stochastic processes of random deaths and births within the local communities and stochastic immigration from the metacommunity the ncm was therefore used as a null model compliance with which would be indicative that neutral stochastic processes predominate in community assembly in lab scale water filters and differences from which would be indicative of deterministic processes predominating the composition of the metacommunity was inferred by averaging the composition of the influent water samples at both sampling points t0 and t56 as proposed by morris et al 2013 in their application of the ncm in order to include the highest number of filter colonisers in the analysis the samples employed to represent the local target communities were those collected in duplicate from the top and bot portions of the four filter columns the frequency of detection was expressed as the number of filter material samples where a specific otu was detected over the total number of filter samples a further analysis was conducted where the filter media samples were considered as source communities and employed to infer the metacommunity composition and the filter effluent samples collected in duplicate at t56 as the local target communities only the otus shared between source and target communities were employed for the analyses the model uses 95 binomial confidence intervals using the hmsic package in r morris et al 2013 and otus falling between these intervals were considered to be present as a result of neutral stochastic processes of random births and deaths within the local communities and stochastic immigration from the source community influent water or filter medium therefore following neutrality otus that fell outside the upper bound of the confidence interval were those characterised by higher frequencies of detection in the local target communities filter medium or effluent water than predicted by the neutral model based on their abundance in the source otus that fell outside the lower bound of the confidence interval were those detected less frequently in the local target communities than predicted by the ncm any deviation from the model upper and lower bound of the confidence interval would represent the predominance of non neutral processes such as environmental selection and competition and would account for those taxa that are advantaged or disadvantaged by the local community environment the best fit of the model with the data was found by calibrating the coupled parameter n t m where m is the immigration rate and n t is the total number of individuals in the local community that was considered stable after 56 days of filter operation the phylogenetic community structure was also characterised using the mean nearest taxon distance mntd and the nearest taxon index nti as described in stegen et al 2012 mntd finds the phylogenetic distance between each otu within a sample and its closest relative in the same sample therefore it measures how phylogenetically close the taxa in a community are related to each other very low mntd values are typical of communities composed of taxa that are highly related and therefore indicative of those communities where environmental selection has overcome stochastic assembly stegen et al 2012 nti quantifies the number of standard deviations that the observed community mntd is from the mean of a null distribution nti greater than 2 indicates a community whose taxa are more closely related than expected by chance whereas an nti less than 2 are indicative of communities where coexisting taxa are more distantly related than expected by chance this method has shown to successfully distinguish niche based assembled local communities from neutrally assembled ones by dispersal using simulated metacommunities kembel 2009 we employed this test to evaluate how much selection has impacted the assembly of our communities over and above stochastic forces average nti values were assigned to sand and gac filters employing the duplicates samples from top and bot portions 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of neutral processes on microbial assembly we observed that the neutral community model accounted for only 28 measured as pearson coefficient p 6 2 10 11 confidence intervals 0 19 1 38 of the observed variation in the frequency of otus as predicted by their relative abundance in the influent water indeed the majority of the taxa employed in the ncm analyses the ones shared between influent water and filter media communities 54 were either more frequent 24 of taxa or less frequent 30 of taxa than would be expected by their relative abundances if they were assembled by neutral stochastic processes alone table 1 fig 2 a this suggests that neutral forces can at best only explain a small part of the microbial assembly and that deterministic forces are predominant in the system if the assembly of the microbial community in the two filter media were neutral rather than determined by environmental selection in the filter the mean relative abundance of each otu in the influent would dictate the frequency with which that otu is detected in the filter regardless the filter medium type therefore plotting the relative abundance of otus in the influent water against the detection frequency of otus in the filter would result in a continuous monotonically increasing curve converging to 100 fig 2 other studies have assessed the consistency of the neutral theory with the assembly of natural microbial communities a study on the microbial composition of lung communities showed a much higher correlation between the model prediction and the empirical observations than that observed by us spearman rank correlation 0 84 morris et al 2013 nevertheless it seems that the correlation we observed is comparable to that in another engineered system activated sludge where the neutral community model could account for 20 of the variability measured as r2 of the heterotroph community ofiteru et al 2010 moreover the microbial communities observed on the filter media of our lab scale filters showed a composition of taxa more phylogenetically related than expected if they were stochastically assembled nti greater than 2 therefore the filtration process itself for our specific conditions and at a laboratory scale exerted a strong selective effect within the 56 days of our study if we assume that all the taxa must have originated from the source community among the filtration processes we studied a further level of selection was posed by the presence of two contrasting materials it appeared that sand exerted a higher environmental pressure than gac selecting for a phylogenetically closer community the mean sand nti observed was significantly higher than the mean gac nti 8 41 and 7 16 respectively t test p 0 013 table si1 in total 683 otus were detected among influent and filter media samples 503 otus were detected on the filter material while 588 otus were detected in the filter influent samples 408 were shared between the source and the filter community and were employed in the model only 46 of the shared otus equal to 37 of the total otus detected in the filter media fell in the neutral region constructed with the 95 binomial confidence intervals table 1 fig 2a the same analysis was performed on the effluent communities this time considering the filter material as a source of dispersal here we observed that the effect of neutral stochastic processes on the community assembly was more pronounced indeed the model was able to describe 50 pearson coefficient p 5 7 10 11 confidence interval 0 37 0 65 of the observed variation in the community fig 2b however 35 of taxa were either more frequent 12 or less frequent 23 than would be expected by their relative abundances if neutral processes alone had assembled them the improved fit with neutrality reflects the stochastic nature of the filtration process itself water flows through the filter sloughing off part of the community that has developed on the filter material and what is present in higher abundance on the filter is then found in higher frequency in the effluent water sloan et al 2006 among the 631 otus detected between filter media and effluent water 611 were detected in the effluent and 503 on the filter media 483 were shared between filter media and effluent water table 1 almost all the otus present on the filter media were detected in the effluent water except 20 which confirms that the filter community seeds the effluent water pinto et al 2012 however 128 otus that were present in the filter effluent were not detected on the filter samples these otus that were passing through pinto et al 2012 the filter were originally present in the influent water but were unable to colonise it they represented 21 of the total otus detected in the effluent these findings suggest that filter communities are not strongly assembled by neutral processes and that the filtration process generates a selective environment where deterministic forces overcome stochastic ones within 56 days of operation dini andreote et al 2015 3 2 the effect of filter medium type on microbial communities in the filters communities that developed on the surface of the two different materials showed significant differences in their similarity anosim global r 0 976 and p 0 1 different samples from the two replicates tended to cluster according to the material on which they developed fig 3 such clustering seems likely to be the result of the different properties of the two types of materials used such as intraparticle porosity surface area chemistry and adsorption capacity furthermore it must be noted that the particle sizes of the two different materials though similar were more varied for gac than sand in more detail planctomyces was the most abundant genus on sand filters sand representing 11 and 13 of the top top and bottom bot communities followed by gemmata at 8 1 top and 1 3 bot and by two other taxa whose genera were not assigned from the pirellulaceae and saprospiraceae families the two otus with the highest relative abundance on gac filters were unidentified beyond the class level a gammaproteobacteria constituted 5 6 and 6 2 of the top and bot gac communities and an unknown bacteria constituted 5 3 and 5 2 of the two communities those otus that contributed the most to the dissimilarity between the two filter communities were identified using the simper similarity percentages analysis in primer these were taxa of the genus planctomyces and gemmata that were detected with a high relative abundance on both materials but with higher values observed in sand rather than in gac in addition species belonging to the genus of gordonia sulfuritalea and nitrospira were identified as main contributors and were detected in very low abundances on gac but with higher abundances in sand two other taxa one belonging to the genus hydrogenophaga and the other to the family opitutaceae were detected mainly in gac columns in a previous study hydrogenophaga related bacteria were one of the most predominant bacteria isolated from different gac filters sampled in the netherlands magic knezev et al 2009 3 3 the effect of filter medium type on microbial communities in the effluent water influent and effluent water samples differed significantly over time and between filter media two way crossed anosim global r 1 and 0 998 respectively p 0 001 for both factors the influent communities at t0 and at t56 showed 53 similarity indicating a change of the feeding water between these sampling times fig 4 a among the effluent samples the bacterial community seemed to cluster according to the filter material samples of the two physical replicates for each filter material clustered together with a similarity of 85 for both sand and gac at t0 and 75 at t56 permanova analyses showed that both filter influent microbial composition and filter material influenced the microbial composition of the effluent water p 0 001 for both factors however the influent water microbial composition seems to be the main contributing factor according to principal component analysis influent water explained 60 8 of the total variation fig 4b while the filter medium type explained 14 of the effluent water composition variation in microbial community similarities the similarity between influent and effluent water communities decreased from the beginning to the end of the experiment from 70 at t0 to 65 at t56 the 30 dissimilarity between influent and effluent water at t0 can only be explained as a direct result of the filtration process where microorganisms in the influent water were removed from the water during the passage through the filter since no other microorganisms were present on the two media at the beginning of the experiment the slight dissimilarity between the two effluent types at this stage of the experiment 15 is probably the result of different porosity created by the two materials due to different grain structures at the end of the experiment the similarity between influent and effluent decreased along with the similarity between the effluents from the two different filter media from 70 to 65 and from 80 to 75 respectively fig 4a in this case the presence of established microbial communities on the filter material might explain the increase of both dissimilarities part of the community developed on the filter seeds the effluent water thereby affecting its composition indeed some of the taxa whose concentration increased from influent to effluent water were those enriched in the filter environment moreover the most abundant bacteria detected in the influent water samples belonged to the class of actinobacteria 15 and 33 at t0 and t56 flavobacteria 24 and 11 at t0 and t56 and betaproteobacteria 30 and 10 at t0 and t56 planctomycetia 12 gac 26 sand alphaproteobacteria 17 gac 12 sand and gammaproteobacteria 9 gac 4 sand were the most abundant classes found on the filter biofilm previous studies have observed that certain species inhabiting freshwater have higher capacity to attach to surfaces and survive in biofilms while others mostly survive in a planktonic state douterelo et al 2013 in freshwater ecosystems flavobacteria often lives in an entirely planktonic state growing on specific algal exudates zeder et al 2009 this would explain the high relative abundance of those bacteria classes in the influent water and their very low abundance on biofilm less than 1 3 4 implications for water quality cell removal suspended cells were removed from the influent water through the columns fig 5 a sand and gac removed the same concentration of cells no statistically significant difference was observed between the two effluents at each sampling time paired t test p value 0 172 both materials removed on average 66 9 of the cells entering the columns however the concentration of cells detected on the columns at the end of the experiment differed between the two materials gac hosted less cells per cm3 than sand despite having a higher specific surface area and a rougher structure that would allow a better cells colonisation in total 4 91 0 48 109 cells cm3 and 2 90 0 20 109 cells cm3 colonised sand and gac respectively fig 5b which is in the same range as previously measured cell concentrations in drinking water biofilters lautenschlager et al 2014 velten et al 2007 we also calculated that during the whole duration of the experiment 1 42 1011 cells entered the columns and 4 51 1010 left the system therefore 9 66 1010 cells were either retained in the columns or removed from the system a total of 3 75 0 64 1010 cells colonised the sand columns at the end of the experiment while 2 22 0 30 1010 cells colonised the gac columns suggesting that in both materials cell decay is an important removal mechanism this net decay was higher in gac a minimum of 7 74 109 cells ignoring cell growth on doc as compared to sand a minimum of 5 62 109 cells this analysis demonstrates that cell removal from the influent water is not merely due to physicochemical entrapment and screening out of cells by the filter material but also involves cell lysis or predation by heterotrophic nano flagellates note that the cell decay could in reality be even higher than calculated since we did not consider cell growth in our cell number balance the gac adsorption capacity was very high at the beginning of the experiment in fact almost 40 of the doc present in the water was removed reducing the amount of doc available in the water for microbial growth this might lead to higher cell decay in the filters and to the lower colonisation of gac on both materials more cells were measured on the top of the columns rather than the bottom fig 5b this was most likely due to higher readily biodegradable substrate availability in this region a stratification already observed in previous studies lautenschlager et al 2014 velten et al 2011 and from the decay of cells filtered onto the columns from the influent the higher amount of cells detected on the top positions of the filters can be linked with the higher observed alpha biodiversity in fact while no differences in terms of alpha biodiversity were observed between the two materials on both materials a higher diversity was observed at the top positions table si2 of supplementary information 3 5 implications for water quality putative pathogens and faecal indicators six main genera that harbour putative pathogens and faecal indicators were identified in the influent and effluent water collected at t56 and on the filter material mycobacterium aeromonas clostridium legionella enterobacter and flavobacterium from here on described as putative pathogens the relative abundances of those genera were multiplied by the total cell concentrations measured using flow cytometry expressed in cells ml or qpcr in order to estimate the final total abundances fig 6 a fig 6b the concentrations of those genera harbouring putative pathogens in the influent water were significantly higher than the concentrations in the effluent water t test p 0 02 except for legionella whose concentration increased from influent to effluent t test p 0 006 and was found significantly higher in sand effluent t test p 0 007 the concentration of mycobacterium clostridium and flavobacterium cells were significantly lower in sand effluent t test p 0 04 than in gac effluent and no significant difference was observed between the two effluent types for enterobacter cells only mycobacterium clostridium legionella and flavobacterium were detected on the filter media mycobacterium cells were found at significantly higher abundance on sand columns in both top and bottom positions t test p 0 02 clostridium cells were detected only in the top positions of the columns in both materials but no significant difference was detected between the two media legionella cells were detected on both media in both positions with a significant higher abundance of cells on the bottom position of sand columns t test p 0 015 finally flavobacterium cells were detected on both materials in both positions but no significant difference was detected between the two materials the absence or their presence at abundances lower than detection limits of aeromonas and enterobacter cells on filter material agrees with previous studies showing poor survival of those bacteria in drinking water biofilm kwon et al 2011 lehtola et al 2007 the filtration process is confirmed as an effective treatment for ensuring a two log reduction of faecal indicators from the influent water over 27 cm total filter depth regardless of the material employed to explain the observed two log reduction between influent and effluent for these passing through bacteria which were absent from the filter biofilm community we estimated very high decay rates equal to 12 0 h 1 for aeromonas in both filter materials and 8 11 h 1 and 11 7 h 1 for enterobacter in sand and gac respectively while aeromonas and enterobacter cells seem to act as taxa that pass through and or decay the rest of the putative pathogens identified colonised the filter in the case of legionella this led to a net cell growth with significant release of cells into the effluent water resulting in increased number of legionella cells compared to the influent species of mycobacterium and legionella have been detected in several drinking water biofilms and a previous study has found that these bacteria are able to accumulate in biofilms even under high shear turbulent flow conditions lehtola et al 2007 the distinct behaviour of different genera harbouring putative pathogens in the water filtration process which tends to shape communities in distribution networks demonstrates a need for more comprehensive characterisation and monitoring of the drinking water microbiome it must also be acknowledged that further research would be necessary to confirm the identity of the taxa identified in this study and referred to as putative pathogens as true pathogens and check their viability 3 6 implications for chemical water quality doc removal and thm formation potential doc removal differed between gac and sand packed columns fig 7 a in gac columns removal started high at 40 due to doc adsorption but dropped after 19 days stabilising at an average of 15 the stable doc removal from day 25 onwards is most likely due to biological activity compared to the chemical physical adsorption that occurred in the first 25 days in sand columns no significant doc removal was recorded in the first 20 days while it progressively increased reaching an average of 9 in the following 36 days which as in the gac columns could likely be attributed to biology velten et al 2011 the difference in doc removal efficiency was also reflected in the thm formation potential of the filter effluents which was 277 9 16 3 μg thms l for sand and 188 8 14 1 μg thms l for the gac columns at 23 h chlorine contact time the organic matter present in water is known to be the main contributor to the formation of several classes of undesirable disinfection by products where thms are the most prevalent the thm formation potential thmfp increases with the concentration of doc present in water ramavandi et al 2015 it was therefore not unexpected that a higher concentration of thms would occur in the sand column effluent where the doc removal was slightly less effective however the amount of thms normalised to the quantity of doc present in the water was at any of the three different chlorine contact times still much higher for sand column effluent than for gac fig 7b it can be inferred that the two materials preferentially removed different fractions of doc with gac being more effective in removing the doc fractions that are responsible for the highest amount of thm produced it has been demonstrated that the chemical characteristics of dissolved organic matter influences the formation of disinfection by products specific doc fractions were found to have a higher thmfp than others ramavandi et al 2015 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 since doc is partially biodegradable selective doc removal by the two filter media would also create two different environmental conditions for the filter colonizing microorganisms whether the preferential removal of thm precursors in gac columns was only due to chemical adsorption or to the combination of chemical activity and biological degradation was not evaluated further studies are required to assess reliably how the different microbial communities of the two filter media distinctly degrade such compounds 4 conclusions this is the first study that investigates the role played by neutral and deterministic factors in the assembly of filter microbial communities in a controlled setting the assembly of lab scale water filter communities is only weakly influenced by neutral processes the filtration process itself exerts an environmental pressure and between the two materials investigated sand selected for communities more phylogenetically closely related than gac two different communities developed on the two materials triggered a difference between the two effluent communities and affecting the overall quality of the effluent water higher abundance of legionella was found on the sand grains resulting in a significantly higher concentration of legionella cells in the sand effluent compared to gac this suggests that such material could preferentially be used to control legionella released in the distribution network the different putative pathogens showed very distinct behaviours suggesting that traditional faecal indicator bacteria such as e coli may not adequately represent other pathogens such as mycobacterium avium and legionella pneumophila in water treatment overall this study has showed that the filter medium is a deterministic factor that can drive the assembly of different microbial communities resulting in the improvement or deterioration of effluent water quality this raises the exciting opportunity that such filter communities could be

19862,perfluorinated organic compounds pfc are an important group of pollutants which are difficult to be degraded in conventional water treatment even hydroxyl radical based processes are not capable to degrade these compounds sulfate radicals can oxidize a group of pfc i e perfluorinated carboxylic pfcas acids however information in literature on kinetics and reaction mechanism is largely based on model simulations which are prone to errors the present study provides mechanistic insights based on product formation material balances competition kinetics experiments and quantum chemical calculations furthermore energy requirements for sulfate radical based degradation of pfca is evaluated in the present study pfcas can be partly mineralized in chain reactions initiated by sulfate radicals so4 the perfluorinated acetic acid tfa propionic acid and butanoic acid are largely degraded in a primary reaction with sulfate radicals in case of pfca with a chain length of 4 carbons low yields of pfca products were observed regarding reaction kinetics sulfate radicals react very slow with pfcas 104 m 1 s 1 thus the energy demand required for generation of so4 by photolysis of s2o8 2 uv s2o8 2 is very high a 90 degradation of a pfca by uv s2o8 2 was estimated to be 55 kw h m 3 in pure water keywords sulfate radicals perfluorinated compounds pfoa energy demand water treatment reaction mechanism trifluoroacetic acid 1 introduction the distribution environmental behavior human health risk and emission routes of perfluorinated compounds pfc are intensively discussed in science as well as on a political level due to the potential harm for human health the us epa set an advisory drinking water standard for perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos of 70 μg l 1 us epa 2016 pfc have a high persistence in the environment and especially long chain pfc such as pfoa and pfos have the tendency for bioaccumulation fujii et al 2007 due to the high mobility and the ubiquitous occurrence of pfc the remediation of contaminated sites is very difficult thus the prevention of pfc release is important that is partly achieved by substitution of pfc with other compounds however the unique features of perfluorinated organics are still important for some applications such as fire fighting foams fujii et al 2007 and the production of semiconductors tang et al 2006 and thus renders replacement difficult pfc are present in the environment and were detected all over the globe rayne and forest 2009 zhou et al 2016 wang et al 2010 zareitalabad et al 2013 pan et al 2014 sammut et al 2017 orellana et al 2017 banzhaf et al 2017 whereby fluorotelomer alcohols may act as highly mobile precursors for perfluorinated carboxylic acids ellis et al 2004 pfc are present in drinking water resources where they probably persist for a long time due to their high environmental stability thus drinking water suppliers have to deal with the possibility of elevated pfc concentrations in their raw water and thereby need to consider treatment strategies as barriers for pfc however besides drinking water other sources of pfc exposure to humans are also important such as house dust diet and air luvarà et al 2010 perfluorinated compounds survive most of the conventional techniques in drinking and wastewater treatment and were observed in finished drinking water in germany switzerland usa and other countries rayne and forest 2009 rumsby et al 2009 in particular treatment techniques based on the structural change of the target molecules such as ozonation or hydroxyl radical oh based oxidation advanced oxidation fail due to the high chemical stability of these compounds schröder and meesters 2005 kutsuna and hori 2007 hori et al 2004 separation methods such as ion exchange and sorption on activated carbon as well as nanofiltration and reverse osmosis appear to be effective to remove pfc from water also combined processes such as the cristal process powdered activated carbon dosage coupled with membrane filtration are promising in removal of some pfc strategies for pcf removal were reviewed in lutze et al 2011 sulfate radical anions so4 are strong oxidizing agents for which a reduction potential in the range of 2 5 3 1 v was reported neta et al 1988 wardman 1989 these radicals can be generated in various ways such as uv

2 experimental procedures solutions were prepared in water purified by an ultra pure water production system purelab ultra from elga so4 were generated by thermolysis and photolysis of s2o8 2 thermolysis was performed at 60 70 and 80 c in a shaking water bath gfl gesellschaft für labortechnik mbh most experiments have been conducted at 70 c which was optimal for sample handling the reaction was stopped by chilling the solutions in an ice bath after different time intervals the solutions were closed gas tight with a screw cap and ptfe sealing for photochemical experiments a merry go round photo reactor was used details on an analogous photo apparatus can be obtained from literature wegelin et al 1994 as radiation source an hg low pressure arc tnn 15 32 15 w hans und thomas schneider glasapparatebau was used the body of this radiation source suprasil quartz glass is transparent for the 185 nm emission line of the hg arc however the recirculating cooling water in the cooling finger acts as a strong spectral filter a 185 nm 200 cm 1 path length 0 5 cm the radiation source must be operated in a protective argon atmosphere the absence of oxygen prevents the formation of ozone thus the inner part of the cooling finger containing the radiation source was continuously purged with argon these experiments were conducted at 25 c in all experiments the ph of the solution was monitored but not adjusted or buffered the use of a buffer was avoided since it can form secondary reactive species in the reaction with so4 details on usage of buffers in so4 based processes are described in literature lutze et al 2015a during the reactions initiated by s2o8 2 and so4 the solution s ph becomes acidic starting ph 4 final ph 2 which was also observed in prior studies qian et al 2016 lutze et al 2015b the drop in ph can be explained by reactions of sulfate radicals with perfluorinated compounds yielding hf reactions 7 9 and 10 and with persulfate which may yield sulfuric acid reactions 18 20 since most of the solutions had a low conductivity and buffer strength the ph was determined by a special electrode used for solutions with low ion concentration serial number 6 0253 100 metrohm for other solutions a regular ph electrode was used serial number 6 0234 100 metrohm for determining rate constants competition kinetics was applied competition method iv described in supporting information of dodd et al 2009 tfa was used as a reference compound because it reacts with comparable kinetics as the other pfcas k so4 1 6 104 m 1 s 1 maruthamuthu et al 1995 tfa is also a potential product of pfca degradation the formation of the competitor i e tfa as a product in competition experiments results in a bias because it slows down the observed degradation rate of the competitor hence the kinetic constant which is derived from such an experiment is underestimated by the yield of the interfering product here tfa in case the primary yields of this product are known this can be taken into account the primary tfa yield in the degradation of c6 c8 is below 5 and can thus be neglected in case of pfcas with lower carbon chain length considerable primary yields of tfa were observed c5 10 c4 30 yield of tfa this results in a maximal 30 underestimation of the reaction rate constant of the pfcas under study this was included in the calculations for the upper limit of reaction rates constants of pfcas with so4 note that the reaction rate constant for pfpra was not determined for achieving the largest conceivable range of reaction rate constants the upper limit of reaction rate constants was not corrected the problems with using tfa as a competitor were accepted since other compounds with such a low reactivity towards so4 are hardly available all compound concentrations were determined by an ion chromatograph coupled with ion suppression and conductivity detector 883 ic basic plus and 881 compact ic pro with additional co2 suppressor unit metrohm

processor metrohm this allowed simultaneous determination of pfcas and fluoride two sample loops were used 20 and 50 μl the analysis by ic of samples containing s2o8 2 is hampered by the long retention time of s2o8 2 the elution of s2o8 2 can be accelerated by addition of acetonitrile or acetone which also suppresses hydrophobic interactions of pfcas with carbon chain length of c3 the ic eluent was based on hco3 and co3 2 which allows to reduce the background conductivity by chemical suppression acidic cation exchanger the eluent used for 883 ic basic plus was composed as follows 0 65

311 g d p basis set as implemented in jaguar 9 3 program jaguar version 9 3 schrodinger llc new york ny 2016 the diffuse function was added because of negatively charged molecules the solvent effect of water was taken into account using jaguar s poisson boltzmann solver pbf tannor et al 1994 the frequency analysis was done to characterize the stationary points on the potential surface and to obtain total enthalpy h and gibbs free energy g at 298 k the reaction enthalpies δh and gibbs free energies of reaction δg0 of studied molecules were calculated as the difference of the calculated h and g between the reactants and products respectively indeed the method provides accurate results to other studies it was shown in our previous work merényi et al 2010 that the dft calculations in solvent water in present case at b3lyp 6 311 d p level of theory differ from the thermokinetic data systematically by some 15 kj mol 1 this is not very much considering that the solvation energy of anions is poorly calculated by dft additionally in actual work to confirm the accuracy of the employed hybrid functional dft calculations were carried out for selected reactions using pbe0 d3 and m06 2x density functionals perdew et al 1996 adamo and barone 1999 zhao and truhlar 2008 pbe0 d3 functional includes also physically and chemically important london dispersion interaction grimme et al 2010 these computational models were already successfully used in our previous works beyer et al 2017 weilbeer et al 2017 stolz et al 2017 the calculated thermochemical parameters show the same trend as those calculated with b3lyp functional for example for the reaction 6 see below the calculated δh and δg are 42 kj mol 1 and 92 kj mol 1 pbe0 d3 and 66 kj mol 1 and 124 kj mol 1 m06 2x these are in agreement with b3lyp results 72 kj mol 1 and 125 kj mol 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 mechanistic aspects of the reaction so4 plus pfcas kutsuna and hori 2007 proposed a reaction pathway for short chain pfca degradation c3 c4 by so4 1 cf3 cf2 2 co o so4 cf3 cf2 2 co o so4 2 2 cf3 cf2 2 co o cf3cf2cf2 co2 3 cf3cf2cf2 o2 cf3cf2cf2 o o 4 2 cf3cf2cf2 o o cf3cf2cf2 o o o o cf2cf2cf3 5 cf3cf2cf2 o o o o cf2cf2cf3 2 cf3cf2cf2o o2 6 cf3cf2cf2o cf3cf2 cof2 7 cof2 h2o co2 2hf 8 cf3cf2cf2o hso4 cf3cf2cf2oh so4 9 cf3cf2cf2oh cf3cf2cof hf 10 cf3cf2cof h2o cf3cf2coo hf h this proposition indicates that the degradation of pfoa is a stepwise elimination of cf2 units leading to pfcas with shorter carbon chains which further react with so4 until complete mineralization to co2 and hf this is supported by the experimental findings of arising and subsequent decomposition of short chain pfcas and a nearly 100 yield of fluoride per cf2 unit degraded hori et al 2005a the presence of perfluoroalkoxyl radicals and oxygen principally enables another pathway which could result in elimination of more than 1 cf2 unit per so4 attack the release of carbonyl fluoride reaction 6 yields a carbon centered radical shortened by one cf2 unit which adds o2 reaction 3 the reaction of oxygen with non perfluorinated carbon centered radicals is often fast von sonntag et al 1997 which likely applies to perfluorinated carbon centered radicals the perfluoroalkylperoxyl radical gives rise to corresponding perfluoroalkoxyl radical in its bimolecular decay reactions 4 and 5 which in turn forms another carbon centered radical in reaction 6 hence reactions 2 6 could comprise an oxygen driven chain reaction peroxyl radicals can principally also decompose in an unimolecular decay in cleaving o2 von sonntag et al 1997 however the unimolecular decay of peroxyl radicals is favored by electron donating groups in α position towards the peroxyl moiety von sonntag et al 1997 thus perfluorinated alkyl groups as electron poor systems are not likely to follow this route reaction 8 may interrupt the oxygen driven chain reaction so4 2 is formed in nearly all reactions of so4 as a result of electron transfer or h abstraction and is present as hso4 at acidic conditions pka 1 9 mackay et al 2006 indeed hso4 so4 2 may be formed in high concentration in corresponding experiments since hori et al applied large amounts of s2o8 2 e g 50 mm that is 100 fold excess over pfoa hori et al 2004 2005a this could increase the driving force of the termination reaction 8 smaller dosages of s2o8 2 i e 2 fold excess over pfcas 10 mm s2o8 2 as done in the present study give a different product pattern fig 1 fig 1 reveals two observations 1 a complete mass balance of fluorine sum of fluoride and fluorine atoms attached to measured pfca divided by fluorine atoms attached to initially added pfca times 100 is contrasting an incomplete pfca mass balance sum of all pfcas divided by initially added pfca times 100 2 different pfca products are formed simultaneously possibly as primary products these observations can be explained by a pfca degrading chain reaction via reactions 3 6 thereby the carbon centered radical from reaction 6 may feed reaction 3 resulting in an additional cleavage of a cf2 unit under formation of co2 and f the number of cycles of this loop would depend on the concentration of scavengers for the oxyl radicals such as in reaction 8 this reaction seems to be less important in the present system presumably due to the low concentration of potential scavengers for perfluorooxylradicals e g hso4 due to a lower dose of persulfate the second observation leads to the assumption that the chain reaction reactions 3 6 is interrupted after different numbers of reaction cycles kutsuna and hori 2007 made similar observations they reported that in the reaction of pfpra tfa was formed with a yield of 88 and in the reaction of pfba a yield of pfpra and tfa of 92 was determined which is higher than in our study however the authors also observed an incomplete primary yield of pfpra from pfba degradation they estimated that 20 of the degradation of pfba directly yields tfa kutsuna and hori 2007 the perfluoroalkoxyl radical may decay by β fragmentation reaction 6 kutsuna and hori 2007 an analogous reaction was observed for tert butoxyl radicals yielding acetone and methyl radicals erben russ et al 1987 rate of unimolecular decomposition 106 107 s 1 gilbert et al 1981 the carbonyl fluoride from reaction 6 is expected to hydrolyze as its chlorinated analogue does k 9 s 1 25 c mertens et al 1994 the carbon centered radical in turn adds oxygen 109 m 1 s 1 von sonntag et al 1997 and yields another peroxylalkoxyl radical reactions 3 5 the smallest perfluorinated oxyl radical f3co may cleave a fluorine atom as a product of β fragmentation reaction 11 since the fluorine atom rapidly reacts with water yielding hf and oh reaction 12 it is removed from the equilibrium which increases the driving force of this reaction 11 f3co f cf2 o 12 f h2o hf oh k 4 1010 m 1 s 1 bucher and scaiano 1994 beside hso4 reaction 8 also s2o8 2 could be a potential scavenger in the present system for assessing the importance of different competing reactions corresponding rate constants are key factors however information of the reactions of perfluoroalkoxyl radicals is lacking in the literature therefore these reactions will be discussed on the basis of thermodynamic data table 1 compiles potential reactions of the perfluorinated alkoxyl radicals occurring in the present reaction system and gives estimates about their kinetics and thermodynamics the rate of elimination of carbonyl fluoride can be derived from the analogous reaction of butoxyl radicals reaction 17 k 106 107 s 1 gilbert et al 1981 δg0 66 kj mol 1 the driving force in the reaction of perfluorinated alkoxyl radicals is even higher δg0 125 kj mol 1 reaction 6 what indicates that the latter reaction reveals the same if not a faster kinetics i e 106 s 1 note that an increase of the reaction rate constant k with δg0 was reported and discussed in detail in a previous study lee et al 2015 the suggested chain interrupting reaction 8 is similar to the corresponding reaction with oh reaction 13 in that they share a similar free energy yield reaction 13 δg0 68 kj mol 1 reaction 8 δg0 53 kj mol 1 the similar δg0 values indicate that both reactions could reveal the same kinetics 106 m 1 s 1 table 1 in the studies of hori et al the concentration of s2o8 2 was 50 mm hori et al 2004 2005a that means maximal 100 mm so4 2 was formed this corresponds to ca 50 mm hso4 and 50 mm so4 2 at ph 2 pk a hso4 1 92 mackay et al 2006 thus at ph 2 the observed reaction rate constant of perfluoroalkoxyl radicals plus hso4 is probably in the range of 104 105 s 1 concentration of hso4 multiplied by second order rate constant of reaction 8 that is at least one order of magnitude below the β fragmentation rate of perfluoroalkoxyl radicals reaction 6 indicating that the unimolecular decay of perfluorooxyl radicals may not be interrupted by reaction 8 note that so4 2 which is present at larger fractions at ph 2 seem not to react with oh jiang et al 1992 which may also apply for the fluorinated oxyl radical however s2o8 2 might also be involved in scavenging of perfluoroalkoxyl radicals reaction 16 the reaction of s2o8 2 with oh is well known reaction 15 and endergonic table 1 the exergonicity of the analogous reaction between s2o8 2 and perfluoroalkoxyl radicals reaction 16 table 1 suggests a similar if not faster reaction kinetics the deprotonated alcohol from reaction 16 is rapidly protonated and forms a carboxylic acid in presence of water reactions 9 and 10 the removal of the alcohol from the reaction system may serve as an additional driving force in reaction 16 assuming that perfluoroalkoxyl radicals react with s2o8 2 at a similar rate as oh following interpretation is conceivable with 50 mm s2o8 2 the observed first order kinetics of reaction 16 is in the same order of magnitude compared with β fragmentation reaction 6 i e 105 106 s 1 this implies that even a small decrease in the concentration of s2o8 2 distinctively diminishes the scavenging of perfluoroalkoxyl radicals and explains why a small change in the concentration of s2o8 2 from 50 to 10 mm already results in considerable differences regarding the product pattern another reaction which might scavenge perfluoroalkoxyl radicals is h abstraction from water reaction 14 this reaction is slightly endergonic 14 kj mol 1 but might experience a considerable driving force due to the high concentration of water 55 5 m moreover the product of reaction 14 is removed from the equilibrium by reactions 9 and 10 hence this reaction could also be a feasible competitor for β fragmentation of the perfluoroalkoxyl radicals reaction 6 the scavenging of perfluoroalkoxyl radicals can also form so4 this is obvious in reaction 8 yielding so4 in a primary reaction reactions 15 and 16 could also give rise to so4 as will be described below the oh formed in reaction 14 has a moderate reactivity towards s2o8 2 reaction 18 k 1 2 107 m 1 s 1 nist which can become dominant if s2o8 2 is present in high concentration e g 50 mm in 1962 house postulated the formation of so4 in the reaction of oh plus s2o8 2 reaction 18b 18b oh s2o8 2 hso4 so4 ½ o2 house 1962 reaction 18b probably includes several steps and is initiated by electron transfer yielding oh and s2o8 s2o8 may decompose as follows scheme 1 note that the stoichiometry of reaction 18b is conserved in the reaction of so4 plus s2o8 2 studied by mark and von sonntag mark et al 1990 a similar pathway was indicated mark and von sonntag observed the evolvement of o2 and a drop in ph which might account for the formation of sulfuric acid reactions 19 and 20 and elimination of o2 in a bimolecular decay of so5 reaction 22 thus the reaction of oh and perfluoroalkoxyl radicals plus s2o8 2 might indeed yield so4 hitherto the degradation of c3 c5 pfcas was discussed by means of primary yields of fluoride and pfca products fig 1 now this discussion will be extended for the range of c2 c8 pfcas fig 2 in pfcas the perfluorinated carbon may be attached to 2 or 3 fluorines r cf2 r and cf3 r hence 2 or 3 fluorines are cleaved off in the proposed reactions 6 7 and 11 thus the primary yield of f can be used for roughly estimating the number of carbons oxidized to co2 in a primary reaction e g a primary yield of 4 fluorides in the reaction of pfoa by so4 indicates that 2 cf2 units were oxidized to co2 per degraded parent compound i e per so4 attack however cleavage of the carboxylic group reactions 1 and 2 precedes formation of fluoride hence the carbon lost by decarboxylation was added to the number of carbons derived from the fluoride formation the sum gives the total number of carbons oxidized to co2 in a reaction of so4 with pfcas the table in fig 2 indicates the number of carbons cleaved in a primary reaction derived by the above approach however especially in case of c3 c5 pfcas rounding errors can cause a large uncertainity and the data should be interpreted carefully roughly 2 4 carbons are oxidized per radical attack indicating that the chain reaction of perfluorinated alkoxylradicals reactions 3 6 may occur a similar degree of primary defluorination was observed for c3 c5 pfcas whereas pfca of longer chain length display a certain suppression of primary defluorination note that in additional experiments a somewhat higher fluorine yield was determined for pfoa resulting in an average of ca 30 primary defluorination in addition the pfca and total fluorine yields of pfcas with chain length of c6 c8 are incomplete indicating that products were formed which were not detected by ic one explanation for the loss of organic fluorine is the formation of perfluorinated peroxides scheme 2 reactions 24 and 25 these peroxides may not be reactive towards so4 and thus represent a sink for fluorine self termination of alkoxylradicals was observed in the chemistry of ch3o albeit in low yields 2 in that case the self termination competes with a fast rearrangement of the alkoxylradicals into hydroxymethyl radicals by a 1 2 h shift von sonntag et al 1997 yet in case of perfluorinated radicals this reaction pathway is not possible and the peroxide yield might be higher this reaction is thought to happen in the solvent cage upon elimination of oxygen thus dimerization of the perfluoroalkoxyl radicals competes with their escape from the solvent cage the residence time of perfluoroalkoxyl radicals in that solvent cage is expected to increase with increasing hydrophobicity i e increasing c chain length resulting in an elevated probability of peroxide formation this would explain the deficient fluorine mass balance especially in case of c6 c8 pfcas however the proposed peroxide was not isolated or identified to corroborate this hypothesis hence this observation still requires clarification that we aim for by further investigation however this is out of scope of the present study 4 2 comparison of pfca and perfluorinated sulfonic acids the second important group of perfluorinated compounds frequently detected in the environment comprises perfluorinated sulfonic acids pfsas the sulfonate group has a much lower electron density than the carboxylic group thus it can be expected that pfsas resist the attack of so4 even more than pfca do for assessing the degradability of pfsas the behavior of tfa was compared with trifluoromethane sulfonic acid tfms in uv s2o8 2 a so4 based process which is more related to water treatment than thermal activation of s2o8 2 in a first step the photochemical system was optimized regarding the s2o8 2 dose for achieving highest possible oxidation strength fig 3 shows the degradation of tfa in uv s2o8 2 at different concentrations of s2o8 2 the fluorine yield in all experiments is 3 per tfa degraded thus each radical attack yields a complete mineralization tfa was not degraded in absence of s2o8 2 during the experimental run hence direct photolysis can be ruled out in the present system the increase of the s2o8 2 dosage results in a higher observed tfa degradation rate fig 3 inset to a certain extent as a consequence of increased radical formation rate however this tendency reaches a plateau at a s2o8 2 dosage of 12 5 25 and 50 mm considering that s2o8 2 reacts by one order of magnitude faster with so4 than tfa k tfa 1 6 104 m 1 s 1 maruthamuthu et al 1995 k s2o8 2 6 3 105 m 1 s 1 herrmann et al 1995 it is remarkable that the degradation of tfa is possible in presence of 10 50 fold excess of s2o8 2 in fact 98 of the so4 available for a reaction with s2o8 2 and tfa will react with s2o8 2 which should largely hamper the degradation of tfa further details on calculations of fractions of different reactions in a mechanism see lutze et al 2015a the observation that tfa is still degraded indicates that the reaction of so4 with s2o8 2 yields so4 in analogy to reactions 18 22 scheme 1 a s2o8 2 concentration of 25 mm was chosen for comparing the behavior of tfms with tfa fig 4 in accordance to the previous results tfa is mineralized during uv s2o8 2 treatment while tfms persisted uv s2o8 2 a further increase of s2o8 2 concentration to 50 mm does also not lead to a significant degradation of tfms with these data at hand it can be postulated that a so4 based pathway of pfsa degradation has no significance in water treatment fig 4 also shows that tfa cannot be degraded by oh in uv h2o2 squares 5 reaction kinetics since the reaction rate constants of tfa competitor and that of pfcas under study are supposed to be similar one can assume similar activation energies that means that the activation energy is cancelled out in the competition plot fig 5 the ratio of the degradation of pfca and tfa gives the reaction rate constant of the pfcas for the conditions under which the degradation kinetics of tfa was determined see maruthamuthu et al 1995 for testing if the activation energies of tfa and other pfcas are similar the competition experiment was performed for pfoa at different temperatures 60 c 70 c and 80 c fig 5 inset the data points of all experiments fall on one line which indicates that the competition experiment is independent from temperature the reaction rate constant of so4 plus different pfcas c8 c4 fig 5 show that the reactivity of pfcas is in the same order of magnitude of tfa k so4 tfa 1 6 104 0 1 m 1 s 1 maruthamuthu et al 1995 the differences in the relative reaction rate constants of pfcas with respect to tfa are not related to the chain length of the pfca and can be considered to originate from experimental errors hence it can be concluded that all pfcas react with so4 with a kinetics in the range of 1 7 104 4 4 104 m 1 s 1 while the number of perfluorinated carbons does not affect the rate constant the degree of halogenation and the type of halogens attached to the carbon chain greatly affects the rate constants table 2 in case of so4 the kinetic data display a sharp drop in the reaction rate constant from monofluoro to difluoro acetate by 40 times and a much smaller decrease of the reactivity from di to trifluoro acetate factor 5 hence it seems to be of minor importance if 2 or 3 fluorine atoms are attached to the α c atom compared to 1 fluorine attached this is in accordance to the observation that the reaction kinetics of tfa and other pfca with so4 is similar despite the different number of fluorine atoms attached at the α carbon tfa 3 fluorine atoms pfcas with larger chain length 2 fluorine atoms oh barely reacts with tfa whereas the single and double fluorinated derivatives are still moderately reactive towards oh the lack of any hydrogen in tfa disables h abstraction thus the oh is forced to react by electron transfer which is hampered by the fluorine driven deactivation of the carboxylic group conversely perchlorinated acetate may still allow electron transfer at the carboxylic group due to the weaker deactivation by the chlorinated alkyl group the upper limit determined for the second order reaction rate constant k oh tfa 106 m 1 s 1 is two orders of magnitude higher than the kinetics of the reaction so4 plus tfa k 1 6 104 m 1 s 1 table 2 thus it is conceivable that oh reacts faster with tfa than so4 yet as shown in fig 4 above tfa persists in oh based systems whereas it is degraded in presence of so4 the reaction kinetics determined in the present study agree well with the data of kutsuna and hori 2007 but are different from qian et al 2016 qian et al derived the reaction rate constants from model calculations by fitting model data to experimental data regarding pfoa degradation and formation of pfca products pfhpa pfhxa pfpea pfba pfpra assuming a stepwise degradation of pfcas i e pfoa forms pfhpa pfhpa forms pfhxa etc in such a kinetic model low yields of pfca products can only be predicted by assuming high degradation rates for the products which minimizes the competition with the parent compounds for so4 this might explain why qian et al determined increasing rate constants with decreasing carbon chain length of pfca 5 1 degradation of perfluorinated compounds in water treatment the present study has shown that pfcas can be oxidized by so4 which is not possible in oh based reactions and that depending on the boundary conditions e g concentration of s2o8 2 the degradation of pfcas is prone to an unzipping reaction converting more than one cf2 unit to co2 and f per radical attack however the reaction rate constants of so4 plus pfcas are very slow 1 6 4 4 104 m 1 s 1 table 2 compared to typical reaction rate constants of so4 with other substrates e g 107 109 m 1 s 1 kinetic constants are compiled in neta et al 1988 thus extremely high oxidant exposures are required to achieve a degradation of pfcas by so4 fig 6 kinetic data taken from neta et al 1988 maruthamuthu et al 1995 lutze et al 2015a manoj et al 2007 for further details on the dependency of oxidant exposure and degradation of pollutants see von sonntag and von gunten 2012 tremendous amounts of energy are required to achieve such so4 exposures as will be explained below the energy demand for 90 atrazine degradation during uv s2o8 2 was determined to be ca 0 9 kw h m 3 for a river water lutze et al 2015b which agrees well to the energy demand required for degradation of atrazine in a lake water by uv h2o2 katsoyiannis et al 2011 if the matrix does not change during the radical based treatment the radical exposure increases linearly with the energy demand hence the energy demand for 90 degradation of pfca is around 5 orders of magnitude higher compared to atrazine degradation this high energy demand cannot compete with other options for pfca removal such as nanofiltration or sorption on activated carbon fig 4 shows the degradation of tfa as a function of the fluence and the corresponding data enable calculating the energy demand for tfa degradation in kwh m 3 hg low pressure arc with 254 nm main emission line 50 tfa degradation required 178 kj m 2 which gives an energy demand of 17 kw h m 3 optical path length 0 01 m details on the calculations can be obtained from katsoyiannis et al 2011 the degradation of tfa is first order with respect to time and fluence and one can extrapolate the fluence for 90 tfa degradation the fluence for 90 tfa degradation is 590 kj m 2 which gives 55 kw h m 3 optical path length 0 01 m this energy demand is in good agreement to the results from qian et al 2016 energy demand reported to be 70 kw h m 3 ultra pure water 15 mm s2o8 2 150 μm pfoa this is 50 times more energy than needed in uv h2o2 for degradation of pollutants such as atrazine see above corroborating that other treatment options may be economically more feasible it has to be mentioned that the energy demand for pfca degradation by so4 presumably increases in presence of other solutes which consume so4 fig 6 shows that nearly all constituents present in a real water matrix e g organic matter chloride bicarbonate and nitrate react faster with so4 than pfcas in case of chloride oh are formed upon oxidation by so4 lutze et al 2015b mcelroy 1990 which however do not react with pfca schröder and meesters 2005 in sum the whole water matrix experiences so4 radical attack until a surplus of oxidation strength is achieved which eventually leads to a degradation of pfcas the chemistry which will be initiated in such a situation involves the formation of numerous other reactive agents e g no3 with uncertain consequences one might now be apt for using the reaction of fe2 plus s2o8 2 which can form so4 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 since this reaction does not require a high electrical energy supply however in this system the degradation of pfcas is hampered by the fast reaction of so4 plus fe2 k 9 9 108 m 1 s 1 nist and it is doubtful if the degradation of pfcas occurs under such conditions 6 conclusion the present study has shown that so4 are principally able to degrade pfcas however the energy demand may be high and pfsas can hardly be degraded by so4 at all other treatment options currently used to remove both classes of compounds from water i e activated carbon filtration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis presumably require less energy reactivation or incineration of activated carbon may also be a potential option for mineralization of pfc in case of pfc mineralization is a desired treatment aim because primary transformation products of perfluorinated compounds are perfluorinated carboxylic acids which are undesired in drinking water even for tfa one of the shortest transformation products of pfc a health related indication value of 3 μg l 1 was set scheurer et al 2016 hence so4 based processes seem not to be a feasible alternative it has to be noted that perfluorinated compounds with small carbon chains c4 might also not be readily removed by activated carbon filtration but maybe by nanofiltration or reverse osmosis another option might be electrochemical oxidation which displays a certain potential to degrade perfluorinated compounds niu et al 2012 including perfluorinated sulfonic acids carter and farrell 2008 water which is heated up in an industrial process may also provide a basis for thermolysis of s2o8 2 without the necessity of applying extra energy and might allow the degradation of pfcas the small reaction rate constant of so4 plus pfcas suggests a high activation energy hence the increase of pfca reaction rate constants with temperature might be more pronounced than the competing reactions with other solutes by this means pfca degradation kinetics might catch up the kinetics of competing side reactions with increasing ambient temperature acknowledgement we thank the water chemistry society for generous financial support of the present work 
19862,perfluorinated organic compounds pfc are an important group of pollutants which are difficult to be degraded in conventional water treatment even hydroxyl radical based processes are not capable to degrade these compounds sulfate radicals can oxidize a group of pfc i e perfluorinated carboxylic pfcas acids however information in literature on kinetics and reaction mechanism is largely based on model simulations which are prone to errors the present study provides mechanistic insights based on product formation material balances competition kinetics experiments and quantum chemical calculations furthermore energy requirements for sulfate radical based degradation of pfca is evaluated in the present study pfcas can be partly mineralized in chain reactions initiated by sulfate radicals so4 the perfluorinated acetic acid tfa propionic acid and butanoic acid are largely degraded in a primary reaction with sulfate radicals in case of pfca with a chain length of 4 carbons low yields of pfca products were observed regarding reaction kinetics sulfate radicals react very slow with pfcas 104 m 1 s 1 thus the energy demand required for generation of so4 by photolysis of s2o8 2 uv s2o8 2 is very high a 90 degradation of a pfca by uv s2o8 2 was estimated to be 55 kw h m 3 in pure water keywords sulfate radicals perfluorinated compounds pfoa energy demand water treatment reaction mechanism trifluoroacetic acid 1 introduction the distribution environmental behavior human health risk and emission routes of perfluorinated compounds pfc are intensively discussed in science as well as on a political level due to the potential harm for human health the us epa set an advisory drinking water standard for perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos of 70 μg l 1 us epa 2016 pfc have a high persistence in the environment and especially long chain pfc such as pfoa and pfos have the tendency for bioaccumulation fujii et al 2007 due to the high mobility and the ubiquitous occurrence of pfc the remediation of contaminated sites is very difficult thus the prevention of pfc release is important that is partly achieved by substitution of pfc with other compounds however the unique features of perfluorinated organics are still important for some applications such as fire fighting foams fujii et al 2007 and the production of semiconductors tang et al 2006 and thus renders replacement difficult pfc are present in the environment and were detected all over the globe rayne and forest 2009 zhou et al 2016 wang et al 2010 zareitalabad et al 2013 pan et al 2014 sammut et al 2017 orellana et al 2017 banzhaf et al 2017 whereby fluorotelomer alcohols may act as highly mobile precursors for perfluorinated carboxylic acids ellis et al 2004 pfc are present in drinking water resources where they probably persist for a long time due to their high environmental stability thus drinking water suppliers have to deal with the possibility of elevated pfc concentrations in their raw water and thereby need to consider treatment strategies as barriers for pfc however besides drinking water other sources of pfc exposure to humans are also important such as house dust diet and air luvarà et al 2010 perfluorinated compounds survive most of the conventional techniques in drinking and wastewater treatment and were observed in finished drinking water in germany switzerland usa and other countries rayne and forest 2009 rumsby et al 2009 in particular treatment techniques based on the structural change of the target molecules such as ozonation or hydroxyl radical oh based oxidation advanced oxidation fail due to the high chemical stability of these compounds schröder and meesters 2005 kutsuna and hori 2007 hori et al 2004 separation methods such as ion exchange and sorption on activated carbon as well as nanofiltration and reverse osmosis appear to be effective to remove pfc from water also combined processes such as the cristal process powdered activated carbon dosage coupled with membrane filtration are promising in removal of some pfc strategies for pcf removal were reviewed in lutze et al 2011 sulfate radical anions so4 are strong oxidizing agents for which a reduction potential in the range of 2 5 3 1 v was reported neta et al 1988 wardman 1989 these radicals can be generated in various ways such as uv photolysis and reduction of peroxodisulfate s2o8 2 or peroxomonosulfate hso5 by transition metals as well as thermolysis of s2o8 2 t 40 c anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 liang and bruell 2008 johnson et al 2008 hori et al 2008 perfluorocarboxylic acids of chain length between c2 c11 were degraded by so4 in pure water systems uv s2o8 2 and thermolysis of s2o8 2 kutsuna and hori 2007 hori et al 2004 2005a 2005b 2008 a second order rate constant has been determined for the reaction of so4 with trifluoroacetic acid 1 6 104 m 1 s 1 maruthamuthu et al 1995 and estimated for pfcas with carbon chain length of c3 1 4 104 m 1 s 1 and c4 1 3 104 m 1 s 1 kutsuna and hori 2007 rate constants for pfca c3 c8 have been derived from kinetic modeling ranging from 2 59 105 m 1 s 1 pfoa to 9 31 107 m 1 s 1 perfluoropropionic acid pfpra qian et al 2016 mechanistic considerations regarding reactions of so4 with pfpra and pfba are available in literature kutsuna and hori 2007 however information on reactions of the widely distributed pfoa is still lacking furthermore most reported rate constants are derived from data fitting in kinetic models with at least two unknowns the present study investigates the mechanistic details on basis of material balances and provides kinetic data determined by competition kinetics the kinetic data was used to assess the energy demand for degradation of

2 experimental procedures solutions were prepared in water purified by an ultra pure water production system purelab ultra from elga so4 were generated by thermolysis and photolysis of s2o8 2 thermolysis was performed at 60 70 and 80 c in a shaking water bath gfl gesellschaft für labortechnik mbh most experiments have been conducted at 70 c which was optimal for sample handling the reaction was stopped by chilling the solutions in an ice bath after different time intervals the solutions were closed gas tight with a screw cap and ptfe sealing for photochemical experiments a merry go round photo reactor was used details on an analogous photo apparatus can be obtained from literature wegelin et al 1994 as radiation source an hg low pressure arc tnn 15 32 15 w hans und thomas schneider glasapparatebau was used the body of this radiation source suprasil quartz glass is transparent for the 185 nm emission line of the hg arc however the recirculating cooling water in the cooling finger acts as a strong spectral filter a 185 nm 200 cm 1 path length 0 5 cm the radiation source must be operated in a protective argon atmosphere the absence of oxygen prevents the formation of ozone thus the inner part of the cooling finger containing the radiation source was continuously purged with argon these experiments were conducted at 25 c in all experiments the ph of the solution was monitored but not adjusted or buffered the use of a buffer was avoided since it can form secondary reactive species in the reaction with so4 details on usage of buffers in so4 based processes are described in literature lutze et al 2015a during the reactions initiated by s2o8 2 and so4 the solution s ph becomes acidic starting ph 4 final ph 2 which was also observed in prior studies qian et al 2016 lutze et al 2015b the drop in ph can be explained by reactions of sulfate radicals with perfluorinated compounds yielding hf reactions 7 9 and 10 and with persulfate which may yield sulfuric acid reactions 18 20 since most of the solutions had a low conductivity and buffer strength the ph was determined by a special electrode used for solutions with low ion concentration serial number 6 0253 100 metrohm for other solutions a regular ph electrode was used serial number 6 0234 100 metrohm for determining rate constants competition kinetics was applied competition method iv described in supporting information of dodd et al 2009 tfa was used as a reference compound because it reacts with comparable kinetics as the other pfcas k so4 1 6 104 m 1 s 1 maruthamuthu et al 1995 tfa is also a potential product of pfca degradation the formation of the competitor i e tfa as a product in competition experiments results in a bias because it slows down the observed degradation rate of the competitor hence the kinetic constant which is derived from such an experiment is underestimated by the yield of the interfering product here tfa in case the primary yields of this product are known this can be taken into account the primary tfa yield in the degradation of c6 c8 is below 5 and can thus be neglected in case of pfcas with lower carbon chain length considerable primary yields of tfa were observed c5 10 c4 30 yield of tfa this results in a maximal 30 underestimation of the reaction rate constant of the pfcas under study this was included in the calculations for the upper limit of reaction rates constants of pfcas with so4 note that the reaction rate constant for pfpra was not determined for achieving the largest conceivable range of reaction rate constants the upper limit of reaction rate constants was not corrected the problems with using tfa as a competitor were accepted since other compounds with such a low reactivity towards so4 are hardly available all compound concentrations were determined by an ion chromatograph coupled with ion suppression and conductivity detector 883 ic basic plus and 881 compact ic pro with additional co2 suppressor unit metrohm

processor metrohm this allowed simultaneous determination of pfcas and fluoride two sample loops were used 20 and 50 μl the analysis by ic of samples containing s2o8 2 is hampered by the long retention time of s2o8 2 the elution of s2o8 2 can be accelerated by addition of acetonitrile or acetone which also suppresses hydrophobic interactions of pfcas with carbon chain length of c3 the ic eluent was based on hco3 and co3 2 which allows to reduce the background conductivity by chemical suppression acidic cation exchanger the eluent used for 883 ic basic plus was composed as follows 0 65

311 g d p basis set as implemented in jaguar 9 3 program jaguar version 9 3 schrodinger llc new york ny 2016 the diffuse function was added because of negatively charged molecules the solvent effect of water was taken into account using jaguar s poisson boltzmann solver pbf tannor et al 1994 the frequency analysis was done to characterize the stationary points on the potential surface and to obtain total enthalpy h and gibbs free energy g at 298 k the reaction enthalpies δh and gibbs free energies of reaction δg0 of studied molecules were calculated as the difference of the calculated h and g between the reactants and products respectively indeed the method provides accurate results to other studies it was shown in our previous work merényi et al 2010 that the dft calculations in solvent water in present case at b3lyp 6 311 d p level of theory differ from the thermokinetic data systematically by some 15 kj mol 1 this is not very much considering that the solvation energy of anions is poorly calculated by dft additionally in actual work to confirm the accuracy of the employed hybrid functional dft calculations were carried out for selected reactions using pbe0 d3 and m06 2x density functionals perdew et al 1996 adamo and barone 1999 zhao and truhlar 2008 pbe0 d3 functional includes also physically and chemically important london dispersion interaction grimme et al 2010 these computational models were already successfully used in our previous works beyer et al 2017 weilbeer et al 2017 stolz et al 2017 the calculated thermochemical parameters show the same trend as those calculated with b3lyp functional for example for the reaction 6 see below the calculated δh and δg are 42 kj mol 1 and 92 kj mol 1 pbe0 d3 and 66 kj mol 1 and 124 kj mol 1 m06 2x these are in agreement with b3lyp results 72 kj mol 1 and 125 kj mol 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 mechanistic aspects of the reaction so4 plus pfcas kutsuna and hori 2007 proposed a reaction pathway for short chain pfca degradation c3 c4 by so4 1 cf3 cf2 2 co o so4 cf3 cf2 2 co o so4 2 2 cf3 cf2 2 co o cf3cf2cf2 co2 3 cf3cf2cf2 o2 cf3cf2cf2 o o 4 2 cf3cf2cf2 o o cf3cf2cf2 o o o o cf2cf2cf3 5 cf3cf2cf2 o o o o cf2cf2cf3 2 cf3cf2cf2o o2 6 cf3cf2cf2o cf3cf2 cof2 7 cof2 h2o co2 2hf 8 cf3cf2cf2o hso4 cf3cf2cf2oh so4 9 cf3cf2cf2oh cf3cf2cof hf 10 cf3cf2cof h2o cf3cf2coo hf h this proposition indicates that the degradation of pfoa is a stepwise elimination of cf2 units leading to pfcas with shorter carbon chains which further react with so4 until complete mineralization to co2 and hf this is supported by the experimental findings of arising and subsequent decomposition of short chain pfcas and a nearly 100 yield of fluoride per cf2 unit degraded hori et al 2005a the presence of perfluoroalkoxyl radicals and oxygen principally enables another pathway which could result in elimination of more than 1 cf2 unit per so4 attack the release of carbonyl fluoride reaction 6 yields a carbon centered radical shortened by one cf2 unit which adds o2 reaction 3 the reaction of oxygen with non perfluorinated carbon centered radicals is often fast von sonntag et al 1997 which likely applies to perfluorinated carbon centered radicals the perfluoroalkylperoxyl radical gives rise to corresponding perfluoroalkoxyl radical in its bimolecular decay reactions 4 and 5 which in turn forms another carbon centered radical in reaction 6 hence reactions 2 6 could comprise an oxygen driven chain reaction peroxyl radicals can principally also decompose in an unimolecular decay in cleaving o2 von sonntag et al 1997 however the unimolecular decay of peroxyl radicals is favored by electron donating groups in α position towards the peroxyl moiety von sonntag et al 1997 thus perfluorinated alkyl groups as electron poor systems are not likely to follow this route reaction 8 may interrupt the oxygen driven chain reaction so4 2 is formed in nearly all reactions of so4 as a result of electron transfer or h abstraction and is present as hso4 at acidic conditions pka 1 9 mackay et al 2006 indeed hso4 so4 2 may be formed in high concentration in corresponding experiments since hori et al applied large amounts of s2o8 2 e g 50 mm that is 100 fold excess over pfoa hori et al 2004 2005a this could increase the driving force of the termination reaction 8 smaller dosages of s2o8 2 i e 2 fold excess over pfcas 10 mm s2o8 2 as done in the present study give a different product pattern fig 1 fig 1 reveals two observations 1 a complete mass balance of fluorine sum of fluoride and fluorine atoms attached to measured pfca divided by fluorine atoms attached to initially added pfca times 100 is contrasting an incomplete pfca mass balance sum of all pfcas divided by initially added pfca times 100 2 different pfca products are formed simultaneously possibly as primary products these observations can be explained by a pfca degrading chain reaction via reactions 3 6 thereby the carbon centered radical from reaction 6 may feed reaction 3 resulting in an additional cleavage of a cf2 unit under formation of co2 and f the number of cycles of this loop would depend on the concentration of scavengers for the oxyl radicals such as in reaction 8 this reaction seems to be less important in the present system presumably due to the low concentration of potential scavengers for perfluorooxylradicals e g hso4 due to a lower dose of persulfate the second observation leads to the assumption that the chain reaction reactions 3 6 is interrupted after different numbers of reaction cycles kutsuna and hori 2007 made similar observations they reported that in the reaction of pfpra tfa was formed with a yield of 88 and in the reaction of pfba a yield of pfpra and tfa of 92 was determined which is higher than in our study however the authors also observed an incomplete primary yield of pfpra from pfba degradation they estimated that 20 of the degradation of pfba directly yields tfa kutsuna and hori 2007 the perfluoroalkoxyl radical may decay by β fragmentation reaction 6 kutsuna and hori 2007 an analogous reaction was observed for tert butoxyl radicals yielding acetone and methyl radicals erben russ et al 1987 rate of unimolecular decomposition 106 107 s 1 gilbert et al 1981 the carbonyl fluoride from reaction 6 is expected to hydrolyze as its chlorinated analogue does k 9 s 1 25 c mertens et al 1994 the carbon centered radical in turn adds oxygen 109 m 1 s 1 von sonntag et al 1997 and yields another peroxylalkoxyl radical reactions 3 5 the smallest perfluorinated oxyl radical f3co may cleave a fluorine atom as a product of β fragmentation reaction 11 since the fluorine atom rapidly reacts with water yielding hf and oh reaction 12 it is removed from the equilibrium which increases the driving force of this reaction 11 f3co f cf2 o 12 f h2o hf oh k 4 1010 m 1 s 1 bucher and scaiano 1994 beside hso4 reaction 8 also s2o8 2 could be a potential scavenger in the present system for assessing the importance of different competing reactions corresponding rate constants are key factors however information of the reactions of perfluoroalkoxyl radicals is lacking in the literature therefore these reactions will be discussed on the basis of thermodynamic data table 1 compiles potential reactions of the perfluorinated alkoxyl radicals occurring in the present reaction system and gives estimates about their kinetics and thermodynamics the rate of elimination of carbonyl fluoride can be derived from the analogous reaction of butoxyl radicals reaction 17 k 106 107 s 1 gilbert et al 1981 δg0 66 kj mol 1 the driving force in the reaction of perfluorinated alkoxyl radicals is even higher δg0 125 kj mol 1 reaction 6 what indicates that the latter reaction reveals the same if not a faster kinetics i e 106 s 1 note that an increase of the reaction rate constant k with δg0 was reported and discussed in detail in a previous study lee et al 2015 the suggested chain interrupting reaction 8 is similar to the corresponding reaction with oh reaction 13 in that they share a similar free energy yield reaction 13 δg0 68 kj mol 1 reaction 8 δg0 53 kj mol 1 the similar δg0 values indicate that both reactions could reveal the same kinetics 106 m 1 s 1 table 1 in the studies of hori et al the concentration of s2o8 2 was 50 mm hori et al 2004 2005a that means maximal 100 mm so4 2 was formed this corresponds to ca 50 mm hso4 and 50 mm so4 2 at ph 2 pk a hso4 1 92 mackay et al 2006 thus at ph 2 the observed reaction rate constant of perfluoroalkoxyl radicals plus hso4 is probably in the range of 104 105 s 1 concentration of hso4 multiplied by second order rate constant of reaction 8 that is at least one order of magnitude below the β fragmentation rate of perfluoroalkoxyl radicals reaction 6 indicating that the unimolecular decay of perfluorooxyl radicals may not be interrupted by reaction 8 note that so4 2 which is present at larger fractions at ph 2 seem not to react with oh jiang et al 1992 which may also apply for the fluorinated oxyl radical however s2o8 2 might also be involved in scavenging of perfluoroalkoxyl radicals reaction 16 the reaction of s2o8 2 with oh is well known reaction 15 and endergonic table 1 the exergonicity of the analogous reaction between s2o8 2 and perfluoroalkoxyl radicals reaction 16 table 1 suggests a similar if not faster reaction kinetics the deprotonated alcohol from reaction 16 is rapidly protonated and forms a carboxylic acid in presence of water reactions 9 and 10 the removal of the alcohol from the reaction system may serve as an additional driving force in reaction 16 assuming that perfluoroalkoxyl radicals react with s2o8 2 at a similar rate as oh following interpretation is conceivable with 50 mm s2o8 2 the observed first order kinetics of reaction 16 is in the same order of magnitude compared with β fragmentation reaction 6 i e 105 106 s 1 this implies that even a small decrease in the concentration of s2o8 2 distinctively diminishes the scavenging of perfluoroalkoxyl radicals and explains why a small change in the concentration of s2o8 2 from 50 to 10 mm already results in considerable differences regarding the product pattern another reaction which might scavenge perfluoroalkoxyl radicals is h abstraction from water reaction 14 this reaction is slightly endergonic 14 kj mol 1 but might experience a considerable driving force due to the high concentration of water 55 5 m moreover the product of reaction 14 is removed from the equilibrium by reactions 9 and 10 hence this reaction could also be a feasible competitor for β fragmentation of the perfluoroalkoxyl radicals reaction 6 the scavenging of perfluoroalkoxyl radicals can also form so4 this is obvious in reaction 8 yielding so4 in a primary reaction reactions 15 and 16 could also give rise to so4 as will be described below the oh formed in reaction 14 has a moderate reactivity towards s2o8 2 reaction 18 k 1 2 107 m 1 s 1 nist which can become dominant if s2o8 2 is present in high concentration e g 50 mm in 1962 house postulated the formation of so4 in the reaction of oh plus s2o8 2 reaction 18b 18b oh s2o8 2 hso4 so4 ½ o2 house 1962 reaction 18b probably includes several steps and is initiated by electron transfer yielding oh and s2o8 s2o8 may decompose as follows scheme 1 note that the stoichiometry of reaction 18b is conserved in the reaction of so4 plus s2o8 2 studied by mark and von sonntag mark et al 1990 a similar pathway was indicated mark and von sonntag observed the evolvement of o2 and a drop in ph which might account for the formation of sulfuric acid reactions 19 and 20 and elimination of o2 in a bimolecular decay of so5 reaction 22 thus the reaction of oh and perfluoroalkoxyl radicals plus s2o8 2 might indeed yield so4 hitherto the degradation of c3 c5 pfcas was discussed by means of primary yields of fluoride and pfca products fig 1 now this discussion will be extended for the range of c2 c8 pfcas fig 2 in pfcas the perfluorinated carbon may be attached to 2 or 3 fluorines r cf2 r and cf3 r hence 2 or 3 fluorines are cleaved off in the proposed reactions 6 7 and 11 thus the primary yield of f can be used for roughly estimating the number of carbons oxidized to co2 in a primary reaction e g a primary yield of 4 fluorides in the reaction of pfoa by so4 indicates that 2 cf2 units were oxidized to co2 per degraded parent compound i e per so4 attack however cleavage of the carboxylic group reactions 1 and 2 precedes formation of fluoride hence the carbon lost by decarboxylation was added to the number of carbons derived from the fluoride formation the sum gives the total number of carbons oxidized to co2 in a reaction of so4 with pfcas the table in fig 2 indicates the number of carbons cleaved in a primary reaction derived by the above approach however especially in case of c3 c5 pfcas rounding errors can cause a large uncertainity and the data should be interpreted carefully roughly 2 4 carbons are oxidized per radical attack indicating that the chain reaction of perfluorinated alkoxylradicals reactions 3 6 may occur a similar degree of primary defluorination was observed for c3 c5 pfcas whereas pfca of longer chain length display a certain suppression of primary defluorination note that in additional experiments a somewhat higher fluorine yield was determined for pfoa resulting in an average of ca 30 primary defluorination in addition the pfca and total fluorine yields of pfcas with chain length of c6 c8 are incomplete indicating that products were formed which were not detected by ic one explanation for the loss of organic fluorine is the formation of perfluorinated peroxides scheme 2 reactions 24 and 25 these peroxides may not be reactive towards so4 and thus represent a sink for fluorine self termination of alkoxylradicals was observed in the chemistry of ch3o albeit in low yields 2 in that case the self termination competes with a fast rearrangement of the alkoxylradicals into hydroxymethyl radicals by a 1 2 h shift von sonntag et al 1997 yet in case of perfluorinated radicals this reaction pathway is not possible and the peroxide yield might be higher this reaction is thought to happen in the solvent cage upon elimination of oxygen thus dimerization of the perfluoroalkoxyl radicals competes with their escape from the solvent cage the residence time of perfluoroalkoxyl radicals in that solvent cage is expected to increase with increasing hydrophobicity i e increasing c chain length resulting in an elevated probability of peroxide formation this would explain the deficient fluorine mass balance especially in case of c6 c8 pfcas however the proposed peroxide was not isolated or identified to corroborate this hypothesis hence this observation still requires clarification that we aim for by further investigation however this is out of scope of the present study 4 2 comparison of pfca and perfluorinated sulfonic acids the second important group of perfluorinated compounds frequently detected in the environment comprises perfluorinated sulfonic acids pfsas the sulfonate group has a much lower electron density than the carboxylic group thus it can be expected that pfsas resist the attack of so4 even more than pfca do for assessing the degradability of pfsas the behavior of tfa was compared with trifluoromethane sulfonic acid tfms in uv s2o8 2 a so4 based process which is more related to water treatment than thermal activation of s2o8 2 in a first step the photochemical system was optimized regarding the s2o8 2 dose for achieving highest possible oxidation strength fig 3 shows the degradation of tfa in uv s2o8 2 at different concentrations of s2o8 2 the fluorine yield in all experiments is 3 per tfa degraded thus each radical attack yields a complete mineralization tfa was not degraded in absence of s2o8 2 during the experimental run hence direct photolysis can be ruled out in the present system the increase of the s2o8 2 dosage results in a higher observed tfa degradation rate fig 3 inset to a certain extent as a consequence of increased radical formation rate however this tendency reaches a plateau at a s2o8 2 dosage of 12 5 25 and 50 mm considering that s2o8 2 reacts by one order of magnitude faster with so4 than tfa k tfa 1 6 104 m 1 s 1 maruthamuthu et al 1995 k s2o8 2 6 3 105 m 1 s 1 herrmann et al 1995 it is remarkable that the degradation of tfa is possible in presence of 10 50 fold excess of s2o8 2 in fact 98 of the so4 available for a reaction with s2o8 2 and tfa will react with s2o8 2 which should largely hamper the degradation of tfa further details on calculations of fractions of different reactions in a mechanism see lutze et al 2015a the observation that tfa is still degraded indicates that the reaction of so4 with s2o8 2 yields so4 in analogy to reactions 18 22 scheme 1 a s2o8 2 concentration of 25 mm was chosen for comparing the behavior of tfms with tfa fig 4 in accordance to the previous results tfa is mineralized during uv s2o8 2 treatment while tfms persisted uv s2o8 2 a further increase of s2o8 2 concentration to 50 mm does also not lead to a significant degradation of tfms with these data at hand it can be postulated that a so4 based pathway of pfsa degradation has no significance in water treatment fig 4 also shows that tfa cannot be degraded by oh in uv h2o2 squares 5 reaction kinetics since the reaction rate constants of tfa competitor and that of pfcas under study are supposed to be similar one can assume similar activation energies that means that the activation energy is cancelled out in the competition plot fig 5 the ratio of the degradation of pfca and tfa gives the reaction rate constant of the pfcas for the conditions under which the degradation kinetics of tfa was determined see maruthamuthu et al 1995 for testing if the activation energies of tfa and other pfcas are similar the competition experiment was performed for pfoa at different temperatures 60 c 70 c and 80 c fig 5 inset the data points of all experiments fall on one line which indicates that the competition experiment is independent from temperature the reaction rate constant of so4 plus different pfcas c8 c4 fig 5 show that the reactivity of pfcas is in the same order of magnitude of tfa k so4 tfa 1 6 104 0 1 m 1 s 1 maruthamuthu et al 1995 the differences in the relative reaction rate constants of pfcas with respect to tfa are not related to the chain length of the pfca and can be considered to originate from experimental errors hence it can be concluded that all pfcas react with so4 with a kinetics in the range of 1 7 104 4 4 104 m 1 s 1 while the number of perfluorinated carbons does not affect the rate constant the degree of halogenation and the type of halogens attached to the carbon chain greatly affects the rate constants table 2 in case of so4 the kinetic data display a sharp drop in the reaction rate constant from monofluoro to difluoro acetate by 40 times and a much smaller decrease of the reactivity from di to trifluoro acetate factor 5 hence it seems to be of minor importance if 2 or 3 fluorine atoms are attached to the α c atom compared to 1 fluorine attached this is in accordance to the observation that the reaction kinetics of tfa and other pfca with so4 is similar despite the different number of fluorine atoms attached at the α carbon tfa 3 fluorine atoms pfcas with larger chain length 2 fluorine atoms oh barely reacts with tfa whereas the single and double fluorinated derivatives are still moderately reactive towards oh the lack of any hydrogen in tfa disables h abstraction thus the oh is forced to react by electron transfer which is hampered by the fluorine driven deactivation of the carboxylic group conversely perchlorinated acetate may still allow electron transfer at the carboxylic group due to the weaker deactivation by the chlorinated alkyl group the upper limit determined for the second order reaction rate constant k oh tfa 106 m 1 s 1 is two orders of magnitude higher than the kinetics of the reaction so4 plus tfa k 1 6 104 m 1 s 1 table 2 thus it is conceivable that oh reacts faster with tfa than so4 yet as shown in fig 4 above tfa persists in oh based systems whereas it is degraded in presence of so4 the reaction kinetics determined in the present study agree well with the data of kutsuna and hori 2007 but are different from qian et al 2016 qian et al derived the reaction rate constants from model calculations by fitting model data to experimental data regarding pfoa degradation and formation of pfca products pfhpa pfhxa pfpea pfba pfpra assuming a stepwise degradation of pfcas i e pfoa forms pfhpa pfhpa forms pfhxa etc in such a kinetic model low yields of pfca products can only be predicted by assuming high degradation rates for the products which minimizes the competition with the parent compounds for so4 this might explain why qian et al determined increasing rate constants with decreasing carbon chain length of pfca 5 1 degradation of perfluorinated compounds in water treatment the present study has shown that pfcas can be oxidized by so4 which is not possible in oh based reactions and that depending on the boundary conditions e g concentration of s2o8 2 the degradation of pfcas is prone to an unzipping reaction converting more than one cf2 unit to co2 and f per radical attack however the reaction rate constants of so4 plus pfcas are very slow 1 6 4 4 104 m 1 s 1 table 2 compared to typical reaction rate constants of so4 with other substrates e g 107 109 m 1 s 1 kinetic constants are compiled in neta et al 1988 thus extremely high oxidant exposures are required to achieve a degradation of pfcas by so4 fig 6 kinetic data taken from neta et al 1988 maruthamuthu et al 1995 lutze et al 2015a manoj et al 2007 for further details on the dependency of oxidant exposure and degradation of pollutants see von sonntag and von gunten 2012 tremendous amounts of energy are required to achieve such so4 exposures as will be explained below the energy demand for 90 atrazine degradation during uv s2o8 2 was determined to be ca 0 9 kw h m 3 for a river water lutze et al 2015b which agrees well to the energy demand required for degradation of atrazine in a lake water by uv h2o2 katsoyiannis et al 2011 if the matrix does not change during the radical based treatment the radical exposure increases linearly with the energy demand hence the energy demand for 90 degradation of pfca is around 5 orders of magnitude higher compared to atrazine degradation this high energy demand cannot compete with other options for pfca removal such as nanofiltration or sorption on activated carbon fig 4 shows the degradation of tfa as a function of the fluence and the corresponding data enable calculating the energy demand for tfa degradation in kwh m 3 hg low pressure arc with 254 nm main emission line 50 tfa degradation required 178 kj m 2 which gives an energy demand of 17 kw h m 3 optical path length 0 01 m details on the calculations can be obtained from katsoyiannis et al 2011 the degradation of tfa is first order with respect to time and fluence and one can extrapolate the fluence for 90 tfa degradation the fluence for 90 tfa degradation is 590 kj m 2 which gives 55 kw h m 3 optical path length 0 01 m this energy demand is in good agreement to the results from qian et al 2016 energy demand reported to be 70 kw h m 3 ultra pure water 15 mm s2o8 2 150 μm pfoa this is 50 times more energy than needed in uv h2o2 for degradation of pollutants such as atrazine see above corroborating that other treatment options may be economically more feasible it has to be mentioned that the energy demand for pfca degradation by so4 presumably increases in presence of other solutes which consume so4 fig 6 shows that nearly all constituents present in a real water matrix e g organic matter chloride bicarbonate and nitrate react faster with so4 than pfcas in case of chloride oh are formed upon oxidation by so4 lutze et al 2015b mcelroy 1990 which however do not react with pfca schröder and meesters 2005 in sum the whole water matrix experiences so4 radical attack until a surplus of oxidation strength is achieved which eventually leads to a degradation of pfcas the chemistry which will be initiated in such a situation involves the formation of numerous other reactive agents e g no3 with uncertain consequences one might now be apt for using the reaction of fe2 plus s2o8 2 which can form so4 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 since this reaction does not require a high electrical energy supply however in this system the degradation of pfcas is hampered by the fast reaction of so4 plus fe2 k 9 9 108 m 1 s 1 nist and it is doubtful if the degradation of pfcas occurs under such conditions 6 conclusion the present study has shown that so4 are principally able to degrade pfcas however the energy demand may be high and pfsas can hardly be degraded by so4 at all other treatment options currently used to remove both classes of compounds from water i e activated carbon filtration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis presumably require less energy reactivation or incineration of activated carbon may also be a potential option for mineralization of pfc in case of pfc mineralization is a desired treatment aim because primary transformation products of perfluorinated compounds are perfluorinated carboxylic acids which are undesired in drinking water even for tfa one of the shortest transformation products of pfc a health related indication value of 3 μg l 1 was set scheurer et al 2016 hence so4 based processes seem not to be a feasible alternative it has to be noted that perfluorinated compounds with small carbon chains c4 might also not be readily removed by activated carbon filtration but maybe by nanofiltration or reverse osmosis another option might be electrochemical oxidation which displays a certain potential to degrade perfluorinated compounds niu et al 2012 including perfluorinated sulfonic acids carter and farrell 2008 water which is heated up in an industrial process may also provide a basis for thermolysis of s2o8 2 without the necessity of applying extra energy and might allow the degradation of pfcas the small reaction rate constant of so4 plus pfcas suggests a high activation energy hence the increase of pfca reaction rate constants with temperature might be more pronounced than the competing reactions with other solutes by this means pfca degradation kinetics might catch up the kinetics of competing side reactions with increasing ambient temperature acknowledgement we thank the water chemistry society for generous financial support of the present work

1 introduction dissolved organic matter om found in drinking water sources includes a biodegradable fraction bom and a non biodegradable fraction the difference between them is operationally defined based on the bom characterization method including aerobic and anoxic methods drinking water utilities are concerned about controlling bom as it a uniquely provides a carbon source for microbial regrowth in the distribution system b can react with disinfectants to yield disinfection by products dbps and c can be specific compounds that are considered contaminants volk et al 1997a lechevallier 2014 regrowth of bacteria can accelerate corrosion lower hydraulic capacity and make it difficult to maintain a disinfection residual in the distribution system kaplan and volk 1994 bom provides energy and carbon for the metabolism of heterotrophic bacteria volk et al 1997c bom to varying levels can be found in all drinking water sources from natural or anthropogenic om bom is also created in a treatment plant after oxidant disinfectant addition especially by ozone and to a lesser extent by chlorine the bom fraction includes identifiable specific biodegradable organic compounds e g formaldehyde geosmin and as well compounds that are not identifiable e g biodegradable humic substances the collective measures biodegradable organic carbon bdoc and assimilable organic carbon aoc are the most commonly used parameters to measure bom under aerobic conditions servais et al 2005 many specific compounds are not biodegradable under the conditions of aerobic drinking water biofilters while others can be completely removed zearley and summers 2012 hallé et al 2015 an extensive evaluation of bom occurrence in drinking water sources with and without ozonation has not been reported filters which remove bom via biological mechanisms biofilters can be operationally defined as filters in which there is no disinfectant residual in the effluent and include bank filtration systems slow sand filters and rapid rate biofilters this review is limited to rapid rate biofilters these filters may utilize a range of media including sand anthracite and granular activated carbon gac disinfectant residuals are readily reduced by gac in the top portion of a filter bed and as such all gac filters are biologically active while many biofilters are incidentally operated additional performance may be achievable both higher levels of removal and additional compounds removed when the design and operation of biofilters are optimized kaplan et al 1994 basu et al 2015 selbes et al 2017 while biofilter performance results have been reported zhu et al 2010 juhna and melin 2006 the impact of design and operational parameters examined basu et al 2015 brown et al 2016 and models developed servais et al 2005 a comprehensive overview and performance meta analysis are not available the objectives of this paper are to review a the levels of bom in drinking water sources with and without ozonation as assessed by aoc and bdoc and b rapid rate biofilter performance as assessed by the removal of bdoc this review is limited to aerobic biological conditions focusing on surface waters and does not explicitly include specific biodegradable organic compounds this review builds on earlier reviews by urfer et al 1997 servais et al 2005 zhu et al 2010 wang et al 2014 basu et al 2015 and brown et al 2016 2 results and discussion 2 1 biodegradable organic matter occurrence review the suite of biodegradable compounds that comprise bom included humic substances amino acids carbohydrates and the ozonated by products obps aldehydes and ketoacids kaplan et al 1980 lytle and perdue 1981 sweet and perdue 1982 kaplan and bott 1983 kaplan et al 2005 volk et al 1997a found stream water doc was comprised of 72 78 humic substances 9 16 carbohydrates mostly polysaccharides 2 3 amino acids and 15 22 om with a molecular weight 100 kda for this source the bdoc represented 21 34 of the doc and was comprised of 68 85 humic substances 22 43 carbohydrates mostly polysaccharides 2 6 amino acids and 33 45 om 100 kda a portion of bom is collectively measured by aoc which measures growth of a microbial inoculum and a larger bom portion by bdoc measurement which measures changes in organic carbon content of sample due to microbial metabolism huck 1990 kaplan et al 2005 aoc is the portion of bdoc that is most readily used by bacteria and converted to cell mass while bdoc is the portion of organic carbon that is biodegraded by heterotrophic microorganisms for 1 energy production and transformed into co2 or other organic substances or 2 for biomass growth huck 1990 escobar and randall 2001b juhna and melin 2006 wang et al 2014 aoc and bdoc measurements provide complementary information and both are important indicators for water biostability volk et al 1994 charnock and kjonno 2000 escobar and randall 2001a wang et al 2014 for instance huck 1990 suggested that aoc bacterial biomass should be measured when determining bacterial regrowth or growth of coliforms and bdoc change in organic carbon concentration should be measured when determining decrease in chlorine demand or dbp formation potential influent source water bom varies over time including seasonal variations as a result of natural and anthropogenic events i e floods droughts algal blooms snowmelt soil run off seasonal changes wastewater industrial and agricultural discharge servais et al 2005 lechevallier 2014 bradford et al 1994 found the aoc to doc ratios were between 0 5 and 31 in surface and groundwaters suggesting that organic carbon can range from biologically stable to very assimilable studies have surveyed aoc and bdoc levels in source waters distribution system reclaimed water treatment and desalination plants kaplan et al 1989 1993 bradford et al 1994 najm et al 2000 volk and lechevallier 2000 2002 wang et al 2014 liu et al 2002 found aoc concentrations in different distribution systems varied due to seasonal and drinking water treatment plant operating conditions a summary of aoc and bdoc surveys is presented in table 1 demonstrates bom variability oxidation of organic matter will increase the biodegradable portion by reducing the size of dom molecules and increasing the number of oxygenated functional groups langlais et al 1991 krasner et al 1992 volk et al 1993 weinberg et al 1993 siddiqui et al 1997 hozalski et al 1999 lechevallier 2014 ozone is a strong oxidant and increases aoc levels in drinking water through the conversion of aromatic unsaturated organic structures humic and fulvic acids to saturated polycarbonaceous compounds of low molecular weight van der kooij et al 1989 volk et al 1997c in addition ozone fosters biological growth by providing large amounts of oxygen to the water which is the electron acceptor for bacteria during doc oxidation juhna and melin 2006 black and bérubé 2014 found preozonation reduced high molecular weight compounds but contrary to the majority of the literature the authors found preozonation did not appear to increase the biodegradability of the source water as the oxidant reacted with both the biodegradable fraction and non biodegradable fraction equally other oxidants i e chlorine potassium permanganate and chlorine dioxide also react with om to increase the level of aoc in treated supplies van der kooij 1987 lechevallier et al 1991 bacteria can more readily utilize the lower molecular weight compounds for growth and energy lechevallier et al 1992 found a 2 fold increase in aoc after ozonation and filter effluent aoc levels were higher in preozonated waters compared to nonozonated waters ozonated byproducts include aldehydes acetones ketoacids aldo ketones and carboxylic acids and they are highly biodegradable krasner et al 1993 weinberg et al 1993 carlson and amy 1998 found the composition of bdoc removed in preozonation biofiltration was 3 of aldehydes 12 ketoacids 13 15 carboxylic acids and 70 72 unknown 2 1 1 bom methods the aoc bioassay method correlates the growth of a test organism either defined inoculum or indigenous microflora with the concentration of bom i e biomass growth weinrich et al 2009 escobar and randall 2001a wang et al 2014 kaplan et al 2005 aoc methods use various strains of organisms most commonly p fluorescens p17 aquaspirillum nox or indigenous bacteria to inoculate and grow bacteria over a specific time period as a result of biodegradable carbon assimilation the bdoc assay method measures the doc consumption over time by indigenous bacteria om oxidation normally in batch reactors escobar and randall 2001a kaplan et al 2005 the bdoc value is calculated as the difference between doc at the beginning and end of the designed time period the doc remaining is the nonbiodegradable or refractory doc kaplan et al 2005 lechevallier 2014 and elhadidy et al 2016 provide detailed explanations of the evolution of the aoc and bdoc methods 2 1 2 occurrence analysis an extensive review of aoc and bdoc values in surface waters with and without ozonation was performed and a statistical analysis of the data is summarized in tables 2 and 3 respectively detailed data are provided in the si tables s1 s2 s3 and s4 paired data as available were collected from each aoc and bdoc study some studies reported only one parameter therefore the number of values n are not equal for all parameters the ozonated waters have more aoc values than toc because most studies did not record toc directly after ozonation all aoc toc and bdoc toc ratios are only reported for paired data all studies reported here used p17 nox or combined p17 and nox for the aoc assay inoculum for the aoc nonozonated data set n 89 the median toc value was 3 5 mg l with a range of 0 5 mg l to 16 3 mg l the median aoc value was 120 μg l with a range of 6 3 μg l to 482 μg l aoc toc ratio varied from 0 2 to 38 3 and had a median of 2 8 while this review focused on surface waters a cursory review of groundwaters was done for the same variables overall groundwater om yielded a smaller median aoc value for nonozonated data n 30 as seen in the si table s5 which is consistent with other literature studies bradford et al 1994 kaplan et al 1994 volk and lechevallier 2002 for the bdoc nonozonated data set n 100 the median toc value was 3 6 mg l with a range of 0 2 mg l to 16 3 mg l the median bdoc value was 1 0 mg l with a range of 0 1 mg l to 7 8 mg l bdoc toc ratio ranged from 1 to 72 with the median at 20 this suggests that 20 of the toc is biodegradable and can be used utilized for energy and biomass growth groundwater om yielded lower bdoc toc ratios n 7 as seen in si table s6 the ratio of aoc to bdoc for 25 paired data sets varied from 3 to 89 and with a median of 22 this suggest that 22 of the bdoc 3 of the toc is highly biodegradable and can be used for biomass growth a best practice approach is to follow ozonation with biofiltration to improve the water biostability in the distribution system in addition this coupled process will yield a decrease in the om ozonation will increase the bom fraction and biofiltration will decrease it leading to an overall decrease in the om fraction ozonation has been shown to increase the bom fraction speitel et al 1993 cipparone et al 1997 hozalski et al 1999 carlson and amy 2001 dowbiggin et al 2001 pharand et al 2015 the literature bom values for ozonated surface waters are summarized in table 3 albeit ozonated data were nonpaired with nonozonated data table 2 i e the ozonated data in table 3 cannot be directly compared to the nonozonated data in table 2 to ascertain the direct impact of ozonation for the ozonated aoc data set the median toc value was 3 2 mg l n 56 slightly lower than the nonozonated median toc the median aoc value for ozonated waters was 230 μg l n 71 the number of aoc values is higher than for toc values as not all studies reported toc values and as expected the median aoc value of the ozonated waters was much higher than the nonozonated median aoc value of 120 μ l while the data were nonpaired other studies have shown similar increases in aoc values after ozonation janssens et al 1984 van der kooij et al 1989 huck 1990 lechevallier et al 1992 the ratio of aoc to toc n 55 increased by a factor of 3 for the ozonated waters compared to the nonozonated ratio values from 2 9 to 8 8 for the ozonated bdoc data set n 103 the median toc value was 2 9 mg l which was lower than the nonozonated median toc of 3 6 mg l the median bdoc value of the ozonated waters was slightly lower 0 8 mg l compared to that 1 0 mg l for the nonpaired nonozonated median value but the median bdoc toc ratio increased from 20 for the nonozonated waters to 30 for the ozonation waters with maximum and minimum ratio values of 62 and 8 respectively other studies have shown similar increases in bdoc toc values after ozonation servais et al 1987 huck 1990 shukairy et al 1992 volk et al 1993 hence after ozonation 30 of the toc is biodegradable and can be utilized by bacteria for energy and biomass growth the nonpaired aoc and bdoc data with and without ozone suggest that ozone increases aoc values more than bdoc values shukairy et al 1992 and escobar and randall 2001b also found ozonation increased aoc more than bdoc this suggests that ozone preferentially generates the more easily assimilated compounds that are detected by aoc measurements aoc bdoc paired ratio values increased from 22 in nonozonated waters n 24 to 30 in the ozonation waters n 17 in nonpaired study comparison thus after ozonation 30 of the bdoc 9 of the total toc can be used by bacteria for biomass growth ozone dose toc was found to be significantly correlated to bdoc toc aoc toc and aoc bdoc ratios p values 0 05 for all three scenarios but a weak linear or other type correlations were found for all three relationships r2 0 4 due to the scatter around the regression line a distribution analysis of the aoc toc and bdoc toc ratios with and without ozone can be seen in fig 1 the distribution of the data found 25th and 75th percentiles of source waters without ozone were 1 3 and 6 aoc toc and 14 and 27 bdoc toc respectively for waters with ozone the data found 25th and 75th percentiles of source waters were 5 and 14 aoc toc and 20 and 38 bdoc toc respectively 2 2 biofiltration performance review biofiltration is an attractive treatment option for bom control due to its effective contaminant removal low maintenance cost and ease of operation for all surface water treatment plants with single stage filtration the primary and paramount objective is the control of microbial pathogens while the removal of bom is a non acute issue both pathogen control and bom removal can be both successfully accomplished with well operated biofilters goldgrabe et al 1993 a survey of 38 north american utilities that employ biofiltration found the drivers for implementing biofiltration were as follows multiple drivers 17 responses taste and odor 15 responses toc removal 14 responses improving filter performance 14 responses dbp removal 11 responses distribution system water quality stability 11 responses sustainable water treatment 5 responses incidental 1 responses and inorganics 1 responses brown et al 2016 zhu et al 2010 and basu et al 2015 have reviewed factors affecting biofilter performance in a semi quantitative manner juhna and melin 2006 reported a range of studies with ozone biofilter removals of 15 30 toc n 19 40 80 aoc n 7 and 25 80 bdoc n 9 as with any treatment option design and operation should be optimized filter media backwash disinfectants empty bed contact time ebct temperature pre oxidants and other parameters affect the removal efficacy of the biofilter and should be optimized if possible to achieve maximum removal hozalski et al 1995 urfer et al 1997 moll et al 1999 zhu et al 2010 basu et al 2015 again this filter optimization needs to be carried out within the design and operation conditions for effective pathogen removal 2 2 1 impact of design and operation parameters filter media filter media e g sand anthracite and gac provides a surface for bacteria to attach and form communities and biomass servais et al 1994 media surface area is important as well as media adsorption capacity in many studies the impact of residual adsorption capacity by gac is not directly assessed so caution needs to be used in over interpreting results attributed to biological removal from short term pilot studies run with gac that has residual adsorption capacity this is illustrated in fig 2 where toc removal is expressed as a function of time for two biofilters one with inert media such as anthracite and sand and one with gac media with inert media the acclimation time is normally 1 3 months for toc removal at normal temperature ranges 10 20 c after that the system will operate at steady state unless there are changes in the influent water quality e g temperature or in operating conditions e g flow rate wang 1995 miltner et al 1995 also shown is the breakthrough history for gac which is impacted by the influent toc concentration and the filter ebct with lower influent toc and higher ebcts leading to longer breakthrough i e better removal at a given time initially the toc removal by gac is greater than that for a biofilter with inert media but with time the gac adsorption capacity for toc becomes slowly exhausted and the removal becomes dominated by biological mechanisms at this point the gac biofilter is often referred to as a biological activated carbon bac filter in this study a conservative approach was taken and toc removal data from biofilters with gac were only used when the gac filter had been run for 18 months a survey of 38 north american utilities found biofilter media configurations was predominantly gac sand 37 and anthracite sand 37 while gac alone 23 and sand alone 3 configurations were less abundant brown et al 2016 some studies have shown that at warm temperatures gac sand and anthracite sand performed similarly but gac sand filters performed better at low temperatures especially for aldehyde removal lechevallier et al 1992 urfer et al 1997 liu et al 2001 emelko et al 2006 selbes et al 2017 found gac provided more removal than anthracite for doc don and dbp precursors while mckie et al 2015 found gac and anthracite performed similarly at two separate drinking water utility locations other studies reported that gac is more adaptable to handle unfavorable conditions such as lower temperatures prechlorination and disinfectant in the backwash as well as provide a buffer for the biofilter ripening period through adsorption krasner et al 1993 carlson et al 1994 servais et al 1994 urfer et al 1997 liu et al 2000 2001 wang et al 1995 found at an ebct of 9 2 min after 6 months of operation the doc removal for gac anthracite and sand biofilters was 29 16 and 20 respectively basu et al 2015 reviewed a study comparing gac to anthracite and found at an ebct of 8 min gac biofilter removed 11 14 of doc and the anthracite biofilter removed 1 3 of doc additionally at an ebct of 16 min gac biofilter removed 15 20 of doc and the anthracite biofilter removed 2 7 of doc chowdhury et al 2009 found gac biofilter removed 9 of toc while anthracite biofilter removed 7 of toc urfer et al 1997 and basu et al 2015 suggested that better performance by gac compared to inert media could be a result of gac s ability to handle adverse operating conditions due to a higher surface area or porosity for biomass accumulation additional adsorption capacity continuous bioregeneration the literature differs on biomass concentrations found on media type some studies found gac to have higher biomass concentrations wang et al 1995 huck et al 2000 others found anthracite to have higher biomass concentrations at high temperatures emelko et al 2006 while others found similar biomass concentrations for anthracite and gac evans et al 2013 pharand et al 2014 even at cold temperatures emelko et al 2006 therefore media selection should be site specific based on influent water quality parameters urfer et al 1997 backwashing procedures backwashing procedures can impact doc removal efficacy basu et al 2015 reviewed backwashing effects on biofilter performance through various mechanisms including detachment and removal of biomass redistribution of media and associated fixed biomass adverse impacts of potential oxidants in the backwash water and elimination of accumulated particles hozalski et al 1999 found periodic backwashing did not affect biofilter performance as long as 60 80 of the biomass was retained liao et al 2015 found the biomass in a gac filter could quickly recover to pre backwash conditions within 2 days and doc removal was highest directly after backwashing disinfectants in the backwash water can have adverse impacts on the performance of biofilters by damaging the biomass through oxidation the detrimental effects of chlorine in the backwash water has been reported by several authors reckhow et al 1992 xie and reckhow 1992 ahmad et al 1994 pharand et al 2013 mckie et al 2015 miltner et al 1996 compared biofilters with different backwash configurations and found the anthracite biofilter with no disinfectant in the backwash outperformed the biofilter backwashed with chloramine disinfectant residual of 2 mg l and both outperformed the biofilter backwashed with chlorine residual of 1 6 mg l in terms of control of nom ozone dbps and dbp precursors liu et al 2000 found the biofilter operated with a chlorinated backwash residual of 1 5 mg l during low temperatures performed worse than the biofilter with no chlorine in backwash during higher temperatures liu et al 2001 found that backwashing with chloramines residual of 0 25 mg l did not significantly affect the bom removal but if chlorine could not be avoided in the backwash water higher temperatures and gac helped reduce the impairment from chlorine wang et al 1995 reported better control of effluent concentrations with a biofilter with no disinfectant in the backwash compared to a biofilter backwashed with chlorine residual of 1 0 mg l however chowdhury et al 2009 found chlorine in the influent and the backwash had no effect on toc removal with gac biofilters wang et al 1995 found higher biomass concentrations on the anthracite filter 55 nmol lipid p gmedia with no exposure to chlorine compared to the anthracite filter that was backwashed with chlorinated water 6 nmol lipid p g media residual of 1 0 mg l miltner et al 1995 suggested that biofilters perform better without disinfectants in the backwash due to a short term weakening of the biomass rather than physical abrasion of the biomass when backwashing urfer et al 1997 found chlorine residual of 1 mg l in the backwash water lowered the amount of biomass in the anthracite sand filter and the removal of chlorine demand but did not affect the removal capacity of quickly biodegrading compounds such as formaldehyde and aoc urfer et al 1997 stated that backwashing biofilters using air scour does not lead to loss of attached biomass because bacteria attached to the media more strongly than nonbiological particles emelko et al 2006 also found that backwashing with or without air scouring did not affect toc removal for gac sand or anthracite sand filters overall the reviewed performance data indicate the better bom removal occurs when a disinfectant is not present in the backwash water fortunately 76 of the 38 north american utilities surveyed in the did not use chlorinated backwash water brown et al 2016 for many existing plants the plant layout is such that producing backwash water without a disinfectant residual would be impractical but the option of a disinfectant residual free backwash water should be provided in new and retro fit plant designs when biofiltration is being considered therefore treatment objectives should be defined before selecting backwash water conditions in order to get the best efficiency from the biofilter ebct empty bed contact time is a measure of the water residence time in the biofilter and is a crucial design parameter for operating biofilters the actual water residence time is about 50 lower as about 50 of the empty bed is occupied by the media hydraulic loading rate hlr measures the flux rate of volumetric flow per unit area of water onto the biofilters and is inversely related to ebct i e lower hlrs increase ebct for a given filter depth as seen in equation 1 1 ebct filter media depth hlr filter media volume flow rate a survey of 38 north american utilities that employ biological filtration found 33 of facilities operated at 2 5 min ebct 20 of facilities operated at 5 7 min ebct 27 of facilities operated at 7 10 min ebct and 20 of facilities operated at 10 min ebct brown et al 2016 longer ebcts yield longer exposure and can enhance utilization of the substrate which leads to more bom and other contaminant removal lechevallier et al 1992 krasner et al 1993 carlson and amy 1995 2001 klevens et al 1996 miltner et al 1996 wu and xie 2005 ko et al 2007 zhang et al 2017 ebct not hlr has an impact on doc removal efficacy and should be the optimized parameter as long as ebct does not conflict with particle removal goals or hydraulic efficiency it has been shown that external mass transfer in the hlr range of 1 5 15 m hr 0 6 6 gpm ft2 does not constrain the removal of doc rather utilization of the substrate at the media surface limits doc biodegradation wang and summers 1994 more than half of north american utilities surveyed operated in the loading rate range of 6 6 12 8 m hr 2 6 5 0 gpm ft2 n 38 brown et al 2016 wang and summers 1994 found that hlrs in the range of 1 5 15 m hr did not affect substrate removal when measured at the same ebct yet as ebct increased from 3 to 33 min doc removal increased from 16 to 24 servais et al 1994 found similar doc removals from three bac filters operated at a constant ebct of 10 min and three different hlrs 6 12 and to 18 m hr similarly carlson and amy 1998 found similar doc removals from two anthracite biofilters operated at different hlrs 5 0 and 9 7 m hr but the same ebct 10 and 11 min chowdhury et al 2009 found when ebct increased from 7 1 to 9 3 min in gac filters toc removal increased from 9 to 11 urfer et al 1997 summarized that studies have shown doc removal increases with ebct but the relationship is not linear lechevallier et al 1992 found doc removal increased from 30 to 50 when the ebct extended from 5 min to 20 min in a gac filter therefore longer ebcts improve doc removal efficiency while increasing ebct will increase bom removal there may be a practical limit or threshold as increasing ebct either yields longer filter bed depths at a set hlr or more filter area larger filters at a set filter depth temperature studies have shown that temperature affects biofiltration performance moll et al 1999 huck et al 2000 fonseca et al 2001 liu et al 2001 fonseca and summers 2003 wu and xie 2005 evans et al 2013 hallé et al 2015 basu et al 2015 selbes et al 2016 as microbial growth and degradation rates are a function of temperature urfer et al 1997 selbes et al 2016 found a large seasonal variability in biofilter performance over a 12 month period with doc removal efficiency the lowest in the colder months 5 and the highest in warmer months 24 moll et al 1999 found nom removal decreased at 5 c 15 doc removal compared to filters operated at 20 and 35 c 24 doc removal emelko et al 2006 showed water temperature significantly affected oxalate removal in gac columns with removals decreasing with decreasing temperature hallé et al 2015 also found the temperature of the feedwater affected doc removal in the biofilters wulfeck and summers 1994 saw toc removal decrease by 34 in full scale biofilters operating at less than 14 c compared to those operating above 14 c hozalski et al 1999 demonstrated that decreased water temperature required longer ebcts to achieve the same steady state removal since doc removal is dependent on temperature conversion of a conventional filter to a biofilter should begin at warmer conditions to allow for a quick ripening period urfer et al 1997 liu et al 2000 mofidi et al 2005 fonseca and summers 2003 reported that temperature did not affect biomass concentration but did impact biofilter activity persson et al 2006 found the specific activity of biofilter biomass was a function of temperature but bdoc removal was only slightly correlated to temperature in the range of 7 c 20 c tradeoffs exists with temperature and ebct as both parameters effect doc removal efficacy higher temperatures and longer ebcts increase doc removal thus ebct should be optimized for the required removal at specific influent temperatures i e longer ebcts are required at colder temperatures to maintain constant removal biomass biomass concentration affects removal efficacy throughout the biofilter as higher biomass allows for more oxidation of toc carlson and amy 1998 however emelko et al 2006 and huck et al 2000 found biomass levels as measured by phospholipid methods were not linearly related to bom removal biomass profile atp and phospholipid measurements throughout the filter have shown to be the highest at the top of the filter and to decrease with increasing filter depth wang et al 1995 huck et al 2000 urfer and huck 2001 persson et al 2006 van der aa et al 2006 velten et al 2011 rahman 2013 xiang et al 2013 pharand et al 2014 biofilters with residual disinfectants entering the filter have low biomass at the top of the filter but once the residual is quenched biomass quickly increases followed by the decreasing trend seen with filters without influent residuals urfer et al 1997 boon et al 2011 velten et al 2011 evans et al 2013 basu et al 2015 reviewed six studies and found biomass ripening periods ranged between 20 days and 16 months liu et al 2001 found biofilter acclimation was a function of temperature backwash conditions type of media and bom characteristics doc removal increases with increasing biomass until some threshold biomass concentration is reached urfer et al 1997 in the steady state biofilm a mass balance of biomass growth and loss due to detachment abrasion and decay is achieved siddiqui et al 1997 operating conditions that damage the biomass should be avoided e g oxidants in the influent or backwash water miltner et al 1995 wang et al 1995 preozonation preozonation as stated above can increase the bom fraction and thus enhance doc removal in the biofilter huck 1990 siddiqui et al 1997 urfer et al 1997 carlson and amy 2001 magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 black and bérubé 2014 selbes et al 2017 a survey of 38 facilities found 63 of them utilize preozonation brown et al 2016 preozonation has been shown to increase biomass activity at the top of the biofilter compared to nonozonated biofilters goel et al 1995 fonseca et al 2001 magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 pharand et al 2014 studies have shown that bdoc degradation rates increase linearly with ozone dose but a threshold ozone dose exist where biodegradation rates plateau carlson and amy 1997 2001 yavich et al 2004 siddiqui et al 1997 found increasing ozone doc ratio converted more doc to bdoc but did not increase doc removal after an ozone doc ratio of 1 mg mg basu et al 2015 summarized from nine studies that the optimal ozone dose for enhancing doc biodegradation in biofilters was 1 2 mgo3 mg toc however the residuals of oxidants into the biofilter should be minimized as they damage the biomass at the top of the biofilter evans et al 2013 urfer et al 1997 reported ozone concentrations of 0 1 0 2 mg l onto the filters inhibited biological activity of anthracite sand filters if oxidant residuals entering the biofilter cannot be minimized gac should be used at the top of the filter to reduce the disinfectant and allow the remaining filter bed to remain biologically active 2 2 2 biofilter performance analysis an extensive review of biofiltration performance for toc removal under a wide range of conditions including temperature preoxidation ebct and media type is summarized in table 4 and the details provided in si tables s7 and s8 the studies consisted of bench pilot and full scale data toc removal values are presented for all temperature ranges and oxidation conditions then further divided into respective temperature range 10 c 10 20 c 20 c and oxidation condition nonozonated and ozonated in addition the ebct average and range are reported at the bottom of the table for the respective temperature and ozonation conditions as it has an impact on toc removal efficiency most studies did not report the removal of bdoc only toc for all temperature and oxidation conditions n 117 biofilters operated in an ebct range of 2 38 min average 12 min removed 12 median of the influent toc with minimum and maximum removals of 2 and 47 temperature affected the biofilter toc removal efficacy a histogram of temperatures throughout the studies n 117 ranging from 0 5 c to 35 c can be seen in fig 3 about half of the studies 51 were performed in the temperature range between 10 c and 20 c comparatively a survey of 38 full scale utilities found 47 of utility source waters ranged between 15 c and 20 c brown et al 2016 in a nonpaired analysis of the removal data by temperature shows that as temperature increased from 10 c 10 20 c 20 c toc removal median values increased from 10 to 12 17 for all the data 7 10 to 15 for the nonozonated data and 11 13 to 20 for the ozonated data respectively as seen in table 4 thus at higher temperatures biofilters removal efficacy increases for both oxidation conditions with at 20 c doubling that at 10 c and 50 higher than that at 10 20 c when the data were separated by oxidation conditions the filter efficiency for nonozonated water n 45 was 10 toc removed median and that for ozonated water n 72 was 15 toc removed median further separating into temperature ranges studies with high temperatures 20 c and ozonated conditions demonstrated the highest toc removal at a median of 20 n 24 with a range of 6 45 the toc removal efficiency at the high temperature range increased from 15 for the nonozonated waters to 20 for the ozonated waters medians however lower differentials were found for median removals at the lower temperature range filter media type gac sand and anthracite had only slight impact on biofilter removal efficacy the studies with gac were only included in our analysis if the gac was in operation for over 18 months about 75 000 bed volumes at a 10 min ebct to ensure the gac adsorption capacity for toc was operationally exhausted and removal was due to biodegradation the median toc removals for gac sand and anthracite at all temperatures and oxidant conditions were 16 n 22 14 n 19 and 13 n 76 respectively as discussed in the literature review ebct also affects the biofilter removal efficacy fig 4 shows a histogram of the ebcts n 102 reported in the studies the distribution of ebct peaks at 7 5 min and drops off after 10 min which then tails out to 38 min a small peak is also seen for 25 30 min ebcts most of the studies 65 were run at ebcts between 2 and 10 min longer ebcts allow for more toc removal and should be optimized for treatment objectives while a systematic impact of temperature and pre oxidation condition can be seen in table 4 results there are high levels of variability in any given category as indicated by the high standard deviations and the resulting coefficient of variation cv values 0 2 to 0 6 part of this variation can be attributed to the range of ebcts in a category which are shown in table 4 the toc removal data only increased by a maximum of 3 when temperature increased from the 10 c range to the 10 20 c range in the all data nonozonated and ozonated conditions this small increase could be a result of longer ebcts at the lower temperature range compared to the medium temperature range for all data ebct averaged 15 min for the 10 c range and 11 min for the 10 20 c range for nonozonated data ebct averaged 14 min for the 10 c range and 12 min for the 10 20 c range for ozonated data ebct averaged 16 min for the 10 c range and 10 min for the 10 20 c range this wide range of ebcts in a given oxidant and temperature category complicates the analysis of the data to overcome this a pseudo first order model was applied to the toc removal data to demonstrate the effects of ebct equation 2 huck et al 1994 wang and summers 1994 zhang and huck 1996 chen et al 2016 with this simplified model bdoc removal is an exponential function of the observed rate constant k and ebct as follows 2 c cinf exp k ebct where c the bdoc concentration of the effluent cinf is the bdoc concentration of the influent k the observed rate constant min 1 and ebct min one drawback of applying this approach is that an average bdoc fraction 20 for the nonozonated waters table 2 and 30 for the ozonated waters table 3 must be assumed to calculate the influent bdoc concentration from the influent toc concentration values the removal of bdoc is first calculated with equation 2 and the toc removal is then calculated based on the assumed bdoc fraction of the toc i e 20 for the nonozonated studies and 30 for the ozonated studies more sophisticated models have been developed for bom removal by biofilters and they are reviewed by servais et al 2005 however the required additional parameters such as biomass and the distribution of easily to more recalcitrant biodegradable om are not available in the literature studies the intent is to use this model to illustrate the impact of ebct and temperature on bom removal not as a calibrated predictive model the k values shown in table 5 were calculated from the literature toc removal and associated ebct table 5 is organized similar to toc removal from table 4 with the data presented all together and then divided into temperature range and oxidation condition the n values for table 5 may not equal to that in table 4 because not all studies reported ebct for all data n 107 the average k value was 0 10 min 1 with a range of 0 01 0 36 min 1 in a nonpaired analysis the average k value increased as the temperature increased for the combined non and ozonated data the average k increased from 0 05 min 1 at 10 c to 0 09 min 1 at 10 20 c to 0 14 min 1 at 20 c for all temperature ranges the average k values increased from 0 08 min 1 for the nonozonated data n 44 to 0 10 min 1 for the ozonated data n 62 for the nonozonated data the average k values increased from 0 05 min 1 at 10 c to 0 09 min 1 at 10 20 c to 0 11 min 1 at 20 c the ozonated data showed the greatest increase as the k value increased from 0 04 min 1 at 10 c to 0 09 min 1 at 10 20 c to 0 15 min 1 at 20 c the observed rate constant illustrates the rate at which toc is biodegraded at higher temperatures toc biodegrades more quickly which is consistent with literature findings moll et al 1999 huck et al 2000 fonseca et al 2001 liu et al 2001 fonseca and summers 2003 wu and xie 2005 evans et al 2013 hallé et al 2015 selbes et al 2016 the large cv values 0 5 to 1 0 are partially an outcome of assuming a constant bdoc fraction of the influent water as the cv values for the bdoc fraction are 0 5 table 2 and 0 4 table 3 for the nonozonated and ozonated waters respectively an analysis of the observed rate constant values as a function of ebct for each temperature and oxidant category showed that the k values are 69 higher for ebcts less than 6 min n 26 compared to ebcts greater than 6 min n 81 above 6 min ebct there was not a significant correlation between ebct and k values for each temperature and oxidant category p values were all 0 12 this is consistent with the approach of dividing the bom into a fast reacting fraction which is consumed in the top of the filter bed and a slower reacting fraction which is consumed throughout the filter servais et al 2005 a distribution analysis of the toc percent removal and k constants with and without ozone can be seen in fig 5 for both parameters the nonozonated water data should not be compared to the ozonated water data as they are not from the same population i e compounding variables ebct and temperature affect toc removal and they are not equally represented in the distribution of the data the distribution of the data found 25th and 75th percentiles of biofiltration toc removal without ozone were 8 and 13 and with ozone were 10 and 20 respectively for k constant the distribution found 25th and 75th percentiles of k values without ozone were 0 03 min 1 and 0 09 min 1 and with ozone were 0 04 min 1 and 0 13 min 1 respectively understanding the impact of ebct on performance allows for optimization of biofilter operations fig 6 demonstrates the effect of ebct using equation 2 and the average literature observed k values from table 5 one k value was used for each temperature range calculated from the literature data k 0 05 min 1 for 10 c k 0 09 min 1 for 10 20 c k 0 14 min 1 for 20 c the toc removals were capped at 20 for the nonozonated studies and 30 for the ozonated studies based on the bdoc values of surface water found in tables 2 and 3 respectively toc removals of ozonated and nonozonated waters were modeled as a function of ebct using equation 2 as seen in fig 6 as ebct increases toc removal increases with ebct and asymptotically approaches bdoc values of 20 or 30 depending on oxidation conditions the advantage of using a constant k value for each temperature range allows utilities to estimate the required ebct for the desired toc removal depending on site specific water temperature in the ebct range of 5 10 min the range reported for 60 of the data differences in removal at 10 c compared to 20 c for either the ozonated or nonozonated waters are greater than that due to ozonation at a given temperature range this illustrates the importance of temperature ebct and ozone on performance ozone is expensive and utilities that do not employ ozone for disinfection can overcome the lack of preoxidant by utilizing longer ebcts to achieve similar toc removals the ability of overcoming the toc removal benefit of preozone through an extension of ebct can be demonstrated with the results in fig 6 if a utility wants a 15 toc removal and is operating in the temperature range of 10 20 c based on fig 6 an ebct of only 7 min is required if the water is preozonated however if pre ozonation is not used an ebct of 15 min can be used to achieve the same 15 toc removal again this analysis is only intended as an estimate of the trade offs that utilities can consider when evaluating biofiltration long term pilot filters are a better way of assessing the design trade offs colder climates with low water temperatures have lower removals at similar ebcts compared to that at warmer climates as shown in fig 6 the biofilter treating ozonated water at 20 c will achieve 20 removal in 8 min however the biofilter treating ozonated water at 10 c will need 22 min of ebct to achieve 20 removal thus if the cold water biofilter were operated at longer ebcts it could achieve similar removal as the biofilter operated in a warmer climate seasonal water temperature changes require optimization of ebct with longer ebcts needed to compensate for less toc removal during colder months fortunately water demand variation is often seasonal with a lower demand during colder seasons thus the ebct can be increased without adverse effects for cold temperatures drinking water utilities can operate all of the filters but at a lower hlr in order to extend the ebct during warmer months shorter ebcts will achieve similar toc removals compared to colder months with longer ebcts therefore drinking water utilities can increase the hlr lowering ebct to meet their demand without reducing toc removal 3 conclusions an extensive literature review found bdoc and aoc comprised 20 and 3 respectively of the toc found in nonozonated water with aoc comprising 22 of the bdoc in the paired data for the ozonated waters bdoc and aoc comprised 30 and 9 respectively of the toc with aoc comprising 30 of the bdoc in the paired data for all temperature and oxidation conditions n 117 biofilters operating in an ebct range of 2 38 min removed 12 median of the influent toc the median filter efficiency for nonozonated water was 10 toc removed n 45 and that for ozonated water was 15 toc removed n 72 temperature had a large impact on the toc removal efficiency as temperature increased from 10 c to 10 20 c to 20 c toc removal median values increased from 10 to 12 17 for all data a pseudo first order model is useful for illustrating the impact of ebct pre ozonation and temperature on biofilter performance biofiltration can be an efficient treatment technology to remove the biodegradable portion of organic matter from the influent water but should be optimized to achieve maximum removal ebct temperature oxidant conditions and

1 introduction dissolved organic matter om found in drinking water sources includes a biodegradable fraction bom and a non biodegradable fraction the difference between them is operationally defined based on the bom characterization method including aerobic and anoxic methods drinking water utilities are concerned about controlling bom as it a uniquely provides a carbon source for microbial regrowth in the distribution system b can react with disinfectants to yield disinfection by products dbps and c can be specific compounds that are considered contaminants volk et al 1997a lechevallier 2014 regrowth of bacteria can accelerate corrosion lower hydraulic capacity and make it difficult to maintain a disinfection residual in the distribution system kaplan and volk 1994 bom provides energy and carbon for the metabolism of heterotrophic bacteria volk et al 1997c bom to varying levels can be found in all drinking water sources from natural or anthropogenic om bom is also created in a treatment plant after oxidant disinfectant addition especially by ozone and to a lesser extent by chlorine the bom fraction includes identifiable specific biodegradable organic compounds e g formaldehyde geosmin and as well compounds that are not identifiable e g biodegradable humic substances the collective measures biodegradable organic carbon bdoc and assimilable organic carbon aoc are the most commonly used parameters to measure bom under aerobic conditions servais et al 2005 many specific compounds are not biodegradable under the conditions of aerobic drinking water biofilters while others can be completely removed zearley and summers 2012 hallé et al 2015 an extensive evaluation of bom occurrence in drinking water sources with and without ozonation has not been reported filters which remove bom via biological mechanisms biofilters can be operationally defined as filters in which there is no disinfectant residual in the effluent and include bank filtration systems slow sand filters and rapid rate biofilters this review is limited to rapid rate biofilters these filters may utilize a range of media including sand anthracite and granular activated carbon gac disinfectant residuals are readily reduced by gac in the top portion of a filter bed and as such all gac filters are biologically active while many biofilters are incidentally operated additional performance may be achievable both higher levels of removal and additional compounds removed when the design and operation of biofilters are optimized kaplan et al 1994 basu et al 2015 selbes et al 2017 while biofilter performance results have been reported zhu et al 2010 juhna and melin 2006 the impact of design and operational parameters examined basu et al 2015 brown et al 2016 and models developed servais et al 2005 a comprehensive overview and performance meta analysis are not available the objectives of this paper are to review a the levels of bom in drinking water sources with and without ozonation as assessed by aoc and bdoc and b rapid rate biofilter performance as assessed by the removal of bdoc this review is limited to aerobic biological conditions focusing on surface waters and does not explicitly include specific biodegradable organic compounds this review builds on earlier reviews by urfer et al 1997 servais et al 2005 zhu et al 2010 wang et al 2014 basu et al 2015 and brown et al 2016 2 results and discussion 2 1 biodegradable organic matter occurrence review the suite of biodegradable compounds that comprise bom included humic substances amino acids carbohydrates and the ozonated by products obps aldehydes and ketoacids kaplan et al 1980 lytle and perdue 1981 sweet and perdue 1982 kaplan and bott 1983 kaplan et al 2005 volk et al 1997a found stream water doc was comprised of 72 78 humic substances 9 16 carbohydrates mostly polysaccharides 2 3 amino acids and 15 22 om with a molecular weight 100 kda for this source the bdoc represented 21 34 of the doc and was comprised of 68 85 humic substances 22 43 carbohydrates mostly polysaccharides 2 6 amino acids and 33 45 om 100 kda a portion of bom is collectively measured by aoc which measures growth of a microbial inoculum and a larger bom portion by bdoc measurement which measures changes in organic carbon content of sample due to microbial metabolism huck 1990 kaplan et al 2005 aoc is the portion of bdoc that is most readily used by bacteria and converted to cell mass while bdoc is the portion of organic carbon that is biodegraded by heterotrophic microorganisms for 1 energy production and transformed into co2 or other organic substances or 2 for biomass growth huck 1990 escobar and randall 2001b juhna and melin 2006 wang et al 2014 aoc and bdoc measurements provide complementary information and both are important indicators for water biostability volk et al 1994 charnock and kjonno 2000 escobar and randall 2001a wang et al 2014 for instance huck 1990 suggested that aoc bacterial biomass should be measured when determining bacterial regrowth or growth of coliforms and bdoc change in organic carbon concentration should be measured when determining decrease in chlorine demand or dbp formation potential influent source water bom varies over time including seasonal variations as a result of natural and anthropogenic events i e floods droughts algal blooms snowmelt soil run off seasonal changes wastewater industrial and agricultural discharge servais et al 2005 lechevallier 2014 bradford et al 1994 found the aoc to doc ratios were between 0 5 and 31 in surface and groundwaters suggesting that organic carbon can range from biologically stable to very assimilable studies have surveyed aoc and bdoc levels in source waters distribution system reclaimed water treatment and desalination plants kaplan et al 1989 1993 bradford et al 1994 najm et al 2000 volk and lechevallier 2000 2002 wang et al 2014 liu et al 2002 found aoc concentrations in different distribution systems varied due to seasonal and drinking water treatment plant operating conditions a summary of aoc and bdoc surveys is presented in table 1 demonstrates bom variability oxidation of organic matter will increase the biodegradable portion by reducing the size of dom molecules and increasing the number of oxygenated functional groups langlais et al 1991 krasner et al 1992 volk et al 1993 weinberg et al 1993 siddiqui et al 1997 hozalski et al 1999 lechevallier 2014 ozone is a strong oxidant and increases aoc levels in drinking water through the conversion of aromatic unsaturated organic structures humic and fulvic acids to saturated polycarbonaceous compounds of low molecular weight van der kooij et al 1989 volk et al 1997c in addition ozone fosters biological growth by providing large amounts of oxygen to the water which is the electron acceptor for bacteria during doc oxidation juhna and melin 2006 black and bérubé 2014 found preozonation reduced high molecular weight compounds but contrary to the majority of the literature the authors found preozonation did not appear to increase the biodegradability of the source water as the oxidant reacted with both the biodegradable fraction and non biodegradable fraction equally other oxidants i e chlorine potassium permanganate and chlorine dioxide also react with om to increase the level of aoc in treated supplies van der kooij 1987 lechevallier et al 1991 bacteria can more readily utilize the lower molecular weight compounds for growth and energy lechevallier et al 1992 found a 2 fold increase in aoc after ozonation and filter effluent aoc levels were higher in preozonated waters compared to nonozonated waters ozonated byproducts include aldehydes acetones ketoacids aldo ketones and carboxylic acids and they are highly biodegradable krasner et al 1993 weinberg et al 1993 carlson and amy 1998 found the composition of bdoc removed in preozonation biofiltration was 3 of aldehydes 12 ketoacids 13 15 carboxylic acids and 70 72 unknown 2 1 1 bom methods the aoc bioassay method correlates the growth of a test organism either defined inoculum or indigenous microflora with the concentration of bom i e biomass growth weinrich et al 2009 escobar and randall 2001a wang et al 2014 kaplan et al 2005 aoc methods use various strains of organisms most commonly p fluorescens p17 aquaspirillum nox or indigenous bacteria to inoculate and grow bacteria over a specific time period as a result of biodegradable carbon assimilation the bdoc assay method measures the doc consumption over time by indigenous bacteria om oxidation normally in batch reactors escobar and randall 2001a kaplan et al 2005 the bdoc value is calculated as the difference between doc at the beginning and end of the designed time period the doc remaining is the nonbiodegradable or refractory doc kaplan et al 2005 lechevallier 2014 and elhadidy et al 2016 provide detailed explanations of the evolution of the aoc and bdoc methods 2 1 2 occurrence analysis an extensive review of aoc and bdoc values in surface waters with and without ozonation was performed and a statistical analysis of the data is summarized in tables 2 and 3 respectively detailed data are provided in the si tables s1 s2 s3 and s4 paired data as available were collected from each aoc and bdoc study some studies reported only one parameter therefore the number of values n are not equal for all parameters the ozonated waters have more aoc values than toc because most studies did not record toc directly after ozonation all aoc toc and bdoc toc ratios are only reported for paired data all studies reported here used p17 nox or combined p17 and nox for the aoc assay inoculum for the aoc nonozonated data set n 89 the median toc value was 3 5 mg l with a range of 0 5 mg l to 16 3 mg l the median aoc value was 120 μg l with a range of 6 3 μg l to 482 μg l aoc toc ratio varied from 0 2 to 38 3 and had a median of 2 8 while this review focused on surface waters a cursory review of groundwaters was done for the same variables overall groundwater om yielded a smaller median aoc value for nonozonated data n 30 as seen in the si table s5 which is consistent with other literature studies bradford et al 1994 kaplan et al 1994 volk and lechevallier 2002 for the bdoc nonozonated data set n 100 the median toc value was 3 6 mg l with a range of 0 2 mg l to 16 3 mg l the median bdoc value was 1 0 mg l with a range of 0 1 mg l to 7 8 mg l bdoc toc ratio ranged from 1 to 72 with the median at 20 this suggests that 20 of the toc is biodegradable and can be used utilized for energy and biomass growth groundwater om yielded lower bdoc toc ratios n 7 as seen in si table s6 the ratio of aoc to bdoc for 25 paired data sets varied from 3 to 89 and with a median of 22 this suggest that 22 of the bdoc 3 of the toc is highly biodegradable and can be used for biomass growth a best practice approach is to follow ozonation with biofiltration to improve the water biostability in the distribution system in addition this coupled process will yield a decrease in the om ozonation will increase the bom fraction and biofiltration will decrease it leading to an overall decrease in the om fraction ozonation has been shown to increase the bom fraction speitel et al 1993 cipparone et al 1997 hozalski et al 1999 carlson and amy 2001 dowbiggin et al 2001 pharand et al 2015 the literature bom values for ozonated surface waters are summarized in table 3 albeit ozonated data were nonpaired with nonozonated data table 2 i e the ozonated data in table 3 cannot be directly compared to the nonozonated data in table 2 to ascertain the direct impact of ozonation for the ozonated aoc data set the median toc value was 3 2 mg l n 56 slightly lower than the nonozonated median toc the median aoc value for ozonated waters was 230 μg l n 71 the number of aoc values is higher than for toc values as not all studies reported toc values and as expected the median aoc value of the ozonated waters was much higher than the nonozonated median aoc value of 120 μ l while the data were nonpaired other studies have shown similar increases in aoc values after ozonation janssens et al 1984 van der kooij et al 1989 huck 1990 lechevallier et al 1992 the ratio of aoc to toc n 55 increased by a factor of 3 for the ozonated waters compared to the nonozonated ratio values from 2 9 to 8 8 for the ozonated bdoc data set n 103 the median toc value was 2 9 mg l which was lower than the nonozonated median toc of 3 6 mg l the median bdoc value of the ozonated waters was slightly lower 0 8 mg l compared to that 1 0 mg l for the nonpaired nonozonated median value but the median bdoc toc ratio increased from 20 for the nonozonated waters to 30 for the ozonation waters with maximum and minimum ratio values of 62 and 8 respectively other studies have shown similar increases in bdoc toc values after ozonation servais et al 1987 huck 1990 shukairy et al 1992 volk et al 1993 hence after ozonation 30 of the toc is biodegradable and can be utilized by bacteria for energy and biomass growth the nonpaired aoc and bdoc data with and without ozone suggest that ozone increases aoc values more than bdoc values shukairy et al 1992 and escobar and randall 2001b also found ozonation increased aoc more than bdoc this suggests that ozone preferentially generates the more easily assimilated compounds that are detected by aoc measurements aoc bdoc paired ratio values increased from 22 in nonozonated waters n 24 to 30 in the ozonation waters n 17 in nonpaired study comparison thus after ozonation 30 of the bdoc 9 of the total toc can be used by bacteria for biomass growth ozone dose toc was found to be significantly correlated to bdoc toc aoc toc and aoc bdoc ratios p values 0 05 for all three scenarios but a weak linear or other type correlations were found for all three relationships r2 0 4 due to the scatter around the regression line a distribution analysis of the aoc toc and bdoc toc ratios with and without ozone can be seen in fig 1 the distribution of the data found 25th and 75th percentiles of source waters without ozone were 1 3 and 6 aoc toc and 14 and 27 bdoc toc respectively for waters with ozone the data found 25th and 75th percentiles of source waters were 5 and 14 aoc toc and 20 and 38 bdoc toc respectively 2 2 biofiltration performance review biofiltration is an attractive treatment option for bom control due to its effective contaminant removal low maintenance cost and ease of operation for all surface water treatment plants with single stage filtration the primary and paramount objective is the control of microbial pathogens while the removal of bom is a non acute issue both pathogen control and bom removal can be both successfully accomplished with well operated biofilters goldgrabe et al 1993 a survey of 38 north american utilities that employ biofiltration found the drivers for implementing biofiltration were as follows multiple drivers 17 responses taste and odor 15 responses toc removal 14 responses improving filter performance 14 responses dbp removal 11 responses distribution system water quality stability 11 responses sustainable water treatment 5 responses incidental 1 responses and inorganics 1 responses brown et al 2016 zhu et al 2010 and basu et al 2015 have reviewed factors affecting biofilter performance in a semi quantitative manner juhna and melin 2006 reported a range of studies with ozone biofilter removals of 15 30 toc n 19 40 80 aoc n 7 and 25 80 bdoc n 9 as with any treatment option design and operation should be optimized filter media backwash disinfectants empty bed contact time ebct temperature pre oxidants and other parameters affect the removal efficacy of the biofilter and should be optimized if possible to achieve maximum removal hozalski et al 1995 urfer et al 1997 moll et al 1999 zhu et al 2010 basu et al 2015 again this filter optimization needs to be carried out within the design and operation conditions for effective pathogen removal 2 2 1 impact of design and operation parameters filter media filter media e g sand anthracite and gac provides a surface for bacteria to attach and form communities and biomass servais et al 1994 media surface area is important as well as media adsorption capacity in many studies the impact of residual adsorption capacity by gac is not directly assessed so caution needs to be used in over interpreting results attributed to biological removal from short term pilot studies run with gac that has residual adsorption capacity this is illustrated in fig 2 where toc removal is expressed as a function of time for two biofilters one with inert media such as anthracite and sand and one with gac media with inert media the acclimation time is normally 1 3 months for toc removal at normal temperature ranges 10 20 c after that the system will operate at steady state unless there are changes in the influent water quality e g temperature or in operating conditions e g flow rate wang 1995 miltner et al 1995 also shown is the breakthrough history for gac which is impacted by the influent toc concentration and the filter ebct with lower influent toc and higher ebcts leading to longer breakthrough i e better removal at a given time initially the toc removal by gac is greater than that for a biofilter with inert media but with time the gac adsorption capacity for toc becomes slowly exhausted and the removal becomes dominated by biological mechanisms at this point the gac biofilter is often referred to as a biological activated carbon bac filter in this study a conservative approach was taken and toc removal data from biofilters with gac were only used when the gac filter had been run for 18 months a survey of 38 north american utilities found biofilter media configurations was predominantly gac sand 37 and anthracite sand 37 while gac alone 23 and sand alone 3 configurations were less abundant brown et al 2016 some studies have shown that at warm temperatures gac sand and anthracite sand performed similarly but gac sand filters performed better at low temperatures especially for aldehyde removal lechevallier et al 1992 urfer et al 1997 liu et al 2001 emelko et al 2006 selbes et al 2017 found gac provided more removal than anthracite for doc don and dbp precursors while mckie et al 2015 found gac and anthracite performed similarly at two separate drinking water utility locations other studies reported that gac is more adaptable to handle unfavorable conditions such as lower temperatures prechlorination and disinfectant in the backwash as well as provide a buffer for the biofilter ripening period through adsorption krasner et al 1993 carlson et al 1994 servais et al 1994 urfer et al 1997 liu et al 2000 2001 wang et al 1995 found at an ebct of 9 2 min after 6 months of operation the doc removal for gac anthracite and sand biofilters was 29 16 and 20 respectively basu et al 2015 reviewed a study comparing gac to anthracite and found at an ebct of 8 min gac biofilter removed 11 14 of doc and the anthracite biofilter removed 1 3 of doc additionally at an ebct of 16 min gac biofilter removed 15 20 of doc and the anthracite biofilter removed 2 7 of doc chowdhury et al 2009 found gac biofilter removed 9 of toc while anthracite biofilter removed 7 of toc urfer et al 1997 and basu et al 2015 suggested that better performance by gac compared to inert media could be a result of gac s ability to handle adverse operating conditions due to a higher surface area or porosity for biomass accumulation additional adsorption capacity continuous bioregeneration the literature differs on biomass concentrations found on media type some studies found gac to have higher biomass concentrations wang et al 1995 huck et al 2000 others found anthracite to have higher biomass concentrations at high temperatures emelko et al 2006 while others found similar biomass concentrations for anthracite and gac evans et al 2013 pharand et al 2014 even at cold temperatures emelko et al 2006 therefore media selection should be site specific based on influent water quality parameters urfer et al 1997 backwashing procedures backwashing procedures can impact doc removal efficacy basu et al 2015 reviewed backwashing effects on biofilter performance through various mechanisms including detachment and removal of biomass redistribution of media and associated fixed biomass adverse impacts of potential oxidants in the backwash water and elimination of accumulated particles hozalski et al 1999 found periodic backwashing did not affect biofilter performance as long as 60 80 of the biomass was retained liao et al 2015 found the biomass in a gac filter could quickly recover to pre backwash conditions within 2 days and doc removal was highest directly after backwashing disinfectants in the backwash water can have adverse impacts on the performance of biofilters by damaging the biomass through oxidation the detrimental effects of chlorine in the backwash water has been reported by several authors reckhow et al 1992 xie and reckhow 1992 ahmad et al 1994 pharand et al 2013 mckie et al 2015 miltner et al 1996 compared biofilters with different backwash configurations and found the anthracite biofilter with no disinfectant in the backwash outperformed the biofilter backwashed with chloramine disinfectant residual of 2 mg l and both outperformed the biofilter backwashed with chlorine residual of 1 6 mg l in terms of control of nom ozone dbps and dbp precursors liu et al 2000 found the biofilter operated with a chlorinated backwash residual of 1 5 mg l during low temperatures performed worse than the biofilter with no chlorine in backwash during higher temperatures liu et al 2001 found that backwashing with chloramines residual of 0 25 mg l did not significantly affect the bom removal but if chlorine could not be avoided in the backwash water higher temperatures and gac helped reduce the impairment from chlorine wang et al 1995 reported better control of effluent concentrations with a biofilter with no disinfectant in the backwash compared to a biofilter backwashed with chlorine residual of 1 0 mg l however chowdhury et al 2009 found chlorine in the influent and the backwash had no effect on toc removal with gac biofilters wang et al 1995 found higher biomass concentrations on the anthracite filter 55 nmol lipid p gmedia with no exposure to chlorine compared to the anthracite filter that was backwashed with chlorinated water 6 nmol lipid p g media residual of 1 0 mg l miltner et al 1995 suggested that biofilters perform better without disinfectants in the backwash due to a short term weakening of the biomass rather than physical abrasion of the biomass when backwashing urfer et al 1997 found chlorine residual of 1 mg l in the backwash water lowered the amount of biomass in the anthracite sand filter and the removal of chlorine demand but did not affect the removal capacity of quickly biodegrading compounds such as formaldehyde and aoc urfer et al 1997 stated that backwashing biofilters using air scour does not lead to loss of attached biomass because bacteria attached to the media more strongly than nonbiological particles emelko et al 2006 also found that backwashing with or without air scouring did not affect toc removal for gac sand or anthracite sand filters overall the reviewed performance data indicate the better bom removal occurs when a disinfectant is not present in the backwash water fortunately 76 of the 38 north american utilities surveyed in the did not use chlorinated backwash water brown et al 2016 for many existing plants the plant layout is such that producing backwash water without a disinfectant residual would be impractical but the option of a disinfectant residual free backwash water should be provided in new and retro fit plant designs when biofiltration is being considered therefore treatment objectives should be defined before selecting backwash water conditions in order to get the best efficiency from the biofilter ebct empty bed contact time is a measure of the water residence time in the biofilter and is a crucial design parameter for operating biofilters the actual water residence time is about 50 lower as about 50 of the empty bed is occupied by the media hydraulic loading rate hlr measures the flux rate of volumetric flow per unit area of water onto the biofilters and is inversely related to ebct i e lower hlrs increase ebct for a given filter depth as seen in equation 1 1 ebct filter media depth hlr filter media volume flow rate a survey of 38 north american utilities that employ biological filtration found 33 of facilities operated at 2 5 min ebct 20 of facilities operated at 5 7 min ebct 27 of facilities operated at 7 10 min ebct and 20 of facilities operated at 10 min ebct brown et al 2016 longer ebcts yield longer exposure and can enhance utilization of the substrate which leads to more bom and other contaminant removal lechevallier et al 1992 krasner et al 1993 carlson and amy 1995 2001 klevens et al 1996 miltner et al 1996 wu and xie 2005 ko et al 2007 zhang et al 2017 ebct not hlr has an impact on doc removal efficacy and should be the optimized parameter as long as ebct does not conflict with particle removal goals or hydraulic efficiency it has been shown that external mass transfer in the hlr range of 1 5 15 m hr 0 6 6 gpm ft2 does not constrain the removal of doc rather utilization of the substrate at the media surface limits doc biodegradation wang and summers 1994 more than half of north american utilities surveyed operated in the loading rate range of 6 6 12 8 m hr 2 6 5 0 gpm ft2 n 38 brown et al 2016 wang and summers 1994 found that hlrs in the range of 1 5 15 m hr did not affect substrate removal when measured at the same ebct yet as ebct increased from 3 to 33 min doc removal increased from 16 to 24 servais et al 1994 found similar doc removals from three bac filters operated at a constant ebct of 10 min and three different hlrs 6 12 and to 18 m hr similarly carlson and amy 1998 found similar doc removals from two anthracite biofilters operated at different hlrs 5 0 and 9 7 m hr but the same ebct 10 and 11 min chowdhury et al 2009 found when ebct increased from 7 1 to 9 3 min in gac filters toc removal increased from 9 to 11 urfer et al 1997 summarized that studies have shown doc removal increases with ebct but the relationship is not linear lechevallier et al 1992 found doc removal increased from 30 to 50 when the ebct extended from 5 min to 20 min in a gac filter therefore longer ebcts improve doc removal efficiency while increasing ebct will increase bom removal there may be a practical limit or threshold as increasing ebct either yields longer filter bed depths at a set hlr or more filter area larger filters at a set filter depth temperature studies have shown that temperature affects biofiltration performance moll et al 1999 huck et al 2000 fonseca et al 2001 liu et al 2001 fonseca and summers 2003 wu and xie 2005 evans et al 2013 hallé et al 2015 basu et al 2015 selbes et al 2016 as microbial growth and degradation rates are a function of temperature urfer et al 1997 selbes et al 2016 found a large seasonal variability in biofilter performance over a 12 month period with doc removal efficiency the lowest in the colder months 5 and the highest in warmer months 24 moll et al 1999 found nom removal decreased at 5 c 15 doc removal compared to filters operated at 20 and 35 c 24 doc removal emelko et al 2006 showed water temperature significantly affected oxalate removal in gac columns with removals decreasing with decreasing temperature hallé et al 2015 also found the temperature of the feedwater affected doc removal in the biofilters wulfeck and summers 1994 saw toc removal decrease by 34 in full scale biofilters operating at less than 14 c compared to those operating above 14 c hozalski et al 1999 demonstrated that decreased water temperature required longer ebcts to achieve the same steady state removal since doc removal is dependent on temperature conversion of a conventional filter to a biofilter should begin at warmer conditions to allow for a quick ripening period urfer et al 1997 liu et al 2000 mofidi et al 2005 fonseca and summers 2003 reported that temperature did not affect biomass concentration but did impact biofilter activity persson et al 2006 found the specific activity of biofilter biomass was a function of temperature but bdoc removal was only slightly correlated to temperature in the range of 7 c 20 c tradeoffs exists with temperature and ebct as both parameters effect doc removal efficacy higher temperatures and longer ebcts increase doc removal thus ebct should be optimized for the required removal at specific influent temperatures i e longer ebcts are required at colder temperatures to maintain constant removal biomass biomass concentration affects removal efficacy throughout the biofilter as higher biomass allows for more oxidation of toc carlson and amy 1998 however emelko et al 2006 and huck et al 2000 found biomass levels as measured by phospholipid methods were not linearly related to bom removal biomass profile atp and phospholipid measurements throughout the filter have shown to be the highest at the top of the filter and to decrease with increasing filter depth wang et al 1995 huck et al 2000 urfer and huck 2001 persson et al 2006 van der aa et al 2006 velten et al 2011 rahman 2013 xiang et al 2013 pharand et al 2014 biofilters with residual disinfectants entering the filter have low biomass at the top of the filter but once the residual is quenched biomass quickly increases followed by the decreasing trend seen with filters without influent residuals urfer et al 1997 boon et al 2011 velten et al 2011 evans et al 2013 basu et al 2015 reviewed six studies and found biomass ripening periods ranged between 20 days and 16 months liu et al 2001 found biofilter acclimation was a function of temperature backwash conditions type of media and bom characteristics doc removal increases with increasing biomass until some threshold biomass concentration is reached urfer et al 1997 in the steady state biofilm a mass balance of biomass growth and loss due to detachment abrasion and decay is achieved siddiqui et al 1997 operating conditions that damage the biomass should be avoided e g oxidants in the influent or backwash water miltner et al 1995 wang et al 1995 preozonation preozonation as stated above can increase the bom fraction and thus enhance doc removal in the biofilter huck 1990 siddiqui et al 1997 urfer et al 1997 carlson and amy 2001 magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 black and bérubé 2014 selbes et al 2017 a survey of 38 facilities found 63 of them utilize preozonation brown et al 2016 preozonation has been shown to increase biomass activity at the top of the biofilter compared to nonozonated biofilters goel et al 1995 fonseca et al 2001 magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 pharand et al 2014 studies have shown that bdoc degradation rates increase linearly with ozone dose but a threshold ozone dose exist where biodegradation rates plateau carlson and amy 1997 2001 yavich et al 2004 siddiqui et al 1997 found increasing ozone doc ratio converted more doc to bdoc but did not increase doc removal after an ozone doc ratio of 1 mg mg basu et al 2015 summarized from nine studies that the optimal ozone dose for enhancing doc biodegradation in biofilters was 1 2 mgo3 mg toc however the residuals of oxidants into the biofilter should be minimized as they damage the biomass at the top of the biofilter evans et al 2013 urfer et al 1997 reported ozone concentrations of 0 1 0 2 mg l onto the filters inhibited biological activity of anthracite sand filters if oxidant residuals entering the biofilter cannot be minimized gac should be used at the top of the filter to reduce the disinfectant and allow the remaining filter bed to remain biologically active 2 2 2 biofilter performance analysis an extensive review of biofiltration performance for toc removal under a wide range of conditions including temperature preoxidation ebct and media type is summarized in table 4 and the details provided in si tables s7 and s8 the studies consisted of bench pilot and full scale data toc removal values are presented for all temperature ranges and oxidation conditions then further divided into respective temperature range 10 c 10 20 c 20 c and oxidation condition nonozonated and ozonated in addition the ebct average and range are reported at the bottom of the table for the respective temperature and ozonation conditions as it has an impact on toc removal efficiency most studies did not report the removal of bdoc only toc for all temperature and oxidation conditions n 117 biofilters operated in an ebct range of 2 38 min average 12 min removed 12 median of the influent toc with minimum and maximum removals of 2 and 47 temperature affected the biofilter toc removal efficacy a histogram of temperatures throughout the studies n 117 ranging from 0 5 c to 35 c can be seen in fig 3 about half of the studies 51 were performed in the temperature range between 10 c and 20 c comparatively a survey of 38 full scale utilities found 47 of utility source waters ranged between 15 c and 20 c brown et al 2016 in a nonpaired analysis of the removal data by temperature shows that as temperature increased from 10 c 10 20 c 20 c toc removal median values increased from 10 to 12 17 for all the data 7 10 to 15 for the nonozonated data and 11 13 to 20 for the ozonated data respectively as seen in table 4 thus at higher temperatures biofilters removal efficacy increases for both oxidation conditions with at 20 c doubling that at 10 c and 50 higher than that at 10 20 c when the data were separated by oxidation conditions the filter efficiency for nonozonated water n 45 was 10 toc removed median and that for ozonated water n 72 was 15 toc removed median further separating into temperature ranges studies with high temperatures 20 c and ozonated conditions demonstrated the highest toc removal at a median of 20 n 24 with a range of 6 45 the toc removal efficiency at the high temperature range increased from 15 for the nonozonated waters to 20 for the ozonated waters medians however lower differentials were found for median removals at the lower temperature range filter media type gac sand and anthracite had only slight impact on biofilter removal efficacy the studies with gac were only included in our analysis if the gac was in operation for over 18 months about 75 000 bed volumes at a 10 min ebct to ensure the gac adsorption capacity for toc was operationally exhausted and removal was due to biodegradation the median toc removals for gac sand and anthracite at all temperatures and oxidant conditions were 16 n 22 14 n 19 and 13 n 76 respectively as discussed in the literature review ebct also affects the biofilter removal efficacy fig 4 shows a histogram of the ebcts n 102 reported in the studies the distribution of ebct peaks at 7 5 min and drops off after 10 min which then tails out to 38 min a small peak is also seen for 25 30 min ebcts most of the studies 65 were run at ebcts between 2 and 10 min longer ebcts allow for more toc removal and should be optimized for treatment objectives while a systematic impact of temperature and pre oxidation condition can be seen in table 4 results there are high levels of variability in any given category as indicated by the high standard deviations and the resulting coefficient of variation cv values 0 2 to 0 6 part of this variation can be attributed to the range of ebcts in a category which are shown in table 4 the toc removal data only increased by a maximum of 3 when temperature increased from the 10 c range to the 10 20 c range in the all data nonozonated and ozonated conditions this small increase could be a result of longer ebcts at the lower temperature range compared to the medium temperature range for all data ebct averaged 15 min for the 10 c range and 11 min for the 10 20 c range for nonozonated data ebct averaged 14 min for the 10 c range and 12 min for the 10 20 c range for ozonated data ebct averaged 16 min for the 10 c range and 10 min for the 10 20 c range this wide range of ebcts in a given oxidant and temperature category complicates the analysis of the data to overcome this a pseudo first order model was applied to the toc removal data to demonstrate the effects of ebct equation 2 huck et al 1994 wang and summers 1994 zhang and huck 1996 chen et al 2016 with this simplified model bdoc removal is an exponential function of the observed rate constant k and ebct as follows 2 c cinf exp k ebct where c the bdoc concentration of the effluent cinf is the bdoc concentration of the influent k the observed rate constant min 1 and ebct min one drawback of applying this approach is that an average bdoc fraction 20 for the nonozonated waters table 2 and 30 for the ozonated waters table 3 must be assumed to calculate the influent bdoc concentration from the influent toc concentration values the removal of bdoc is first calculated with equation 2 and the toc removal is then calculated based on the assumed bdoc fraction of the toc i e 20 for the nonozonated studies and 30 for the ozonated studies more sophisticated models have been developed for bom removal by biofilters and they are reviewed by servais et al 2005 however the required additional parameters such as biomass and the distribution of easily to more recalcitrant biodegradable om are not available in the literature studies the intent is to use this model to illustrate the impact of ebct and temperature on bom removal not as a calibrated predictive model the k values shown in table 5 were calculated from the literature toc removal and associated ebct table 5 is organized similar to toc removal from table 4 with the data presented all together and then divided into temperature range and oxidation condition the n values for table 5 may not equal to that in table 4 because not all studies reported ebct for all data n 107 the average k value was 0 10 min 1 with a range of 0 01 0 36 min 1 in a nonpaired analysis the average k value increased as the temperature increased for the combined non and ozonated data the average k increased from 0 05 min 1 at 10 c to 0 09 min 1 at 10 20 c to 0 14 min 1 at 20 c for all temperature ranges the average k values increased from 0 08 min 1 for the nonozonated data n 44 to 0 10 min 1 for the ozonated data n 62 for the nonozonated data the average k values increased from 0 05 min 1 at 10 c to 0 09 min 1 at 10 20 c to 0 11 min 1 at 20 c the ozonated data showed the greatest increase as the k value increased from 0 04 min 1 at 10 c to 0 09 min 1 at 10 20 c to 0 15 min 1 at 20 c the observed rate constant illustrates the rate at which toc is biodegraded at higher temperatures toc biodegrades more quickly which is consistent with literature findings moll et al 1999 huck et al 2000 fonseca et al 2001 liu et al 2001 fonseca and summers 2003 wu and xie 2005 evans et al 2013 hallé et al 2015 selbes et al 2016 the large cv values 0 5 to 1 0 are partially an outcome of assuming a constant bdoc fraction of the influent water as the cv values for the bdoc fraction are 0 5 table 2 and 0 4 table 3 for the nonozonated and ozonated waters respectively an analysis of the observed rate constant values as a function of ebct for each temperature and oxidant category showed that the k values are 69 higher for ebcts less than 6 min n 26 compared to ebcts greater than 6 min n 81 above 6 min ebct there was not a significant correlation between ebct and k values for each temperature and oxidant category p values were all 0 12 this is consistent with the approach of dividing the bom into a fast reacting fraction which is consumed in the top of the filter bed and a slower reacting fraction which is consumed throughout the filter servais et al 2005 a distribution analysis of the toc percent removal and k constants with and without ozone can be seen in fig 5 for both parameters the nonozonated water data should not be compared to the ozonated water data as they are not from the same population i e compounding variables ebct and temperature affect toc removal and they are not equally represented in the distribution of the data the distribution of the data found 25th and 75th percentiles of biofiltration toc removal without ozone were 8 and 13 and with ozone were 10 and 20 respectively for k constant the distribution found 25th and 75th percentiles of k values without ozone were 0 03 min 1 and 0 09 min 1 and with ozone were 0 04 min 1 and 0 13 min 1 respectively understanding the impact of ebct on performance allows for optimization of biofilter operations fig 6 demonstrates the effect of ebct using equation 2 and the average literature observed k values from table 5 one k value was used for each temperature range calculated from the literature data k 0 05 min 1 for 10 c k 0 09 min 1 for 10 20 c k 0 14 min 1 for 20 c the toc removals were capped at 20 for the nonozonated studies and 30 for the ozonated studies based on the bdoc values of surface water found in tables 2 and 3 respectively toc removals of ozonated and nonozonated waters were modeled as a function of ebct using equation 2 as seen in fig 6 as ebct increases toc removal increases with ebct and asymptotically approaches bdoc values of 20 or 30 depending on oxidation conditions the advantage of using a constant k value for each temperature range allows utilities to estimate the required ebct for the desired toc removal depending on site specific water temperature in the ebct range of 5 10 min the range reported for 60 of the data differences in removal at 10 c compared to 20 c for either the ozonated or nonozonated waters are greater than that due to ozonation at a given temperature range this illustrates the importance of temperature ebct and ozone on performance ozone is expensive and utilities that do not employ ozone for disinfection can overcome the lack of preoxidant by utilizing longer ebcts to achieve similar toc removals the ability of overcoming the toc removal benefit of preozone through an extension of ebct can be demonstrated with the results in fig 6 if a utility wants a 15 toc removal and is operating in the temperature range of 10 20 c based on fig 6 an ebct of only 7 min is required if the water is preozonated however if pre ozonation is not used an ebct of 15 min can be used to achieve the same 15 toc removal again this analysis is only intended as an estimate of the trade offs that utilities can consider when evaluating biofiltration long term pilot filters are a better way of assessing the design trade offs colder climates with low water temperatures have lower removals at similar ebcts compared to that at warmer climates as shown in fig 6 the biofilter treating ozonated water at 20 c will achieve 20 removal in 8 min however the biofilter treating ozonated water at 10 c will need 22 min of ebct to achieve 20 removal thus if the cold water biofilter were operated at longer ebcts it could achieve similar removal as the biofilter operated in a warmer climate seasonal water temperature changes require optimization of ebct with longer ebcts needed to compensate for less toc removal during colder months fortunately water demand variation is often seasonal with a lower demand during colder seasons thus the ebct can be increased without adverse effects for cold temperatures drinking water utilities can operate all of the filters but at a lower hlr in order to extend the ebct during warmer months shorter ebcts will achieve similar toc removals compared to colder months with longer ebcts therefore drinking water utilities can increase the hlr lowering ebct to meet their demand without reducing toc removal 3 conclusions an extensive literature review found bdoc and aoc comprised 20 and 3 respectively of the toc found in nonozonated water with aoc comprising 22 of the bdoc in the paired data for the ozonated waters bdoc and aoc comprised 30 and 9 respectively of the toc with aoc comprising 30 of the bdoc in the paired data for all temperature and oxidation conditions n 117 biofilters operating in an ebct range of 2 38 min removed 12 median of the influent toc the median filter efficiency for nonozonated water was 10 toc removed n 45 and that for ozonated water was 15 toc removed n 72 temperature had a large impact on the toc removal efficiency as temperature increased from 10 c to 10 20 c to 20 c toc removal median values increased from 10 to 12 17 for all data a pseudo first order model is useful for illustrating the impact of ebct pre ozonation and temperature on biofilter performance biofiltration can be an efficient treatment technology to remove the biodegradable portion of organic matter from the influent water but should be optimized to achieve maximum removal ebct temperature oxidant conditions and backwash strategies among others can impact biofilter efficacy and should be carefully chosen or taken into consideration in the design and operation of biofilters acknowledgements the authors were

19864,capacitive deionization cdi is considered to be one of the most promising technologies for the desalination of brackish water with low to medium salinity in practical applications faradaic redox reactions occurring in cdi may have both negative and positive effects on cdi performance in this review we present an overview of the types and mechanisms of faradaic reactions in cdi systems including anodic oxidation of carbon electrodes cathodic reduction of oxygen and faradaic ion storage and identify their apparent negative and positive effects on water desalination a variety of strategies including development of novel electrode materials and use of alternative configurations and or operational modes are proposed for the purpose of mitigation or elimination of the deterioration of electrodes and the formation of byproducts caused by undesired side faradaic reactions it is also recognized that faradaic reactions facilitate a variety of exciting new applications including i the incorporation of intercalation electrodes to enhance water desalination or to selectively separate certain ions through reversible faradaic reactions and ii the use of particular anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction reactions to realize functions such as water disinfection and contaminant removal graphical abstract image keywords capacitive deionization faradaic reactions electrode oxidation ph fluctuations intercalation electrodes 1 introduction with ongoing population growth and continuing industry development the demand for freshwater has become one of the most critical global challenges of the 21st century elimelech and phillip 2011 porada et al 2013b shannon et al 2008 the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco estimates that nearly one third of the world s population is now living in water stressed regions with this number expected to double by the year 2025 unesco 2009 to satisfy this demand various water desalination technologies have been developed to produce freshwater from seawater and brackish water given that nearly 98 of the total water available falls into these categories where brackish water is classified as water containing salt concentrations in the range of 1000 10 000 mg l elimelech and phillip 2011 georgopoulou et al 2001 humplik et al 2011 of the various water desalination technologies available e g reverse osmosis and electrodialysis capacitive deionization cdi is considered to be one of the most promising alternatives for desalination of waters with low to medium salinity porada et al 2013b subramani and jacangelo 2015 suss et al 2015 the study of cdi dates back to the late 1960s and early 1970s caudle 1966 johnson and newman 1971 murphy and caudle 1967 followed by a gap in the development of this technology between the late 1970s and mid 2000s porada et al 2013b over the last twenty years however breakthroughs in electrode materials and preparation huang et al 2017 liu et al 2015 cell configurations gao et al 2015b jeon et al 2013 lee et al 2006 2014 suss et al 2012 operational modes garcia quismondo et al 2016 zhao et al 2012 and process modelling dykstra et al 2016 porada et al 2013a tang et al 2016 have generated renewed interest in cdi technology from both water treatment and energy recovery perspectives as evidence of this renewed interest the number of papers published in the cdi field has increased enormously since 2000 fig 1 in a typical cdi cell fig 2 when applying a voltage difference across the two electrodes cations are attracted to the cathode and anions to the anode resulting in the salt ions being removed from solution following ion electrosorption the electrodes can be regenerated by short circulating the anode and cathode or executing polarity reversal with the trapped ions released back into the brine stream huang et al 2013 suss et al 2015 zhao et al 2013 there are two main mechanisms for ion storage during cdi desalination processes i e non faradaic ion storage and faradaic ion storage biesheuvel et al 2017 su and hatton 2017 with non faradaic capacitive ion storage the most important electrochemical process for salt removal this process is based on the formation of an electrical double layer edl at the carbon electrode where upon applying a potential difference ions are captured electrostatically and stored capacitively in the diffuse layer formed inside the carbon electrode intraparticle pores porada et al 2013b in order to enhance the non faradaic capacitive ion storage considerable efforts have been invested in fabricating electrode materials with high adsorption capacity and sustainable use these properties are usually associated with materials that possess high surface area appropriate pore distribution excellent electrical conductivity and good chemical stability liu et al 2015 faradaic processes although assumed by early investigators to facilitate ion removal from water johnson et al 1970 porada et al 2013b have not been extensively examined until recently whilst non faradaic processes are the most common phenomenon in cdi it is now recognized that faradaic reactions fig 3 may have both negative and positive effects on cdi performance various types of faradaic reactions exist in cdi systems some of which need to be considered seriously as they may lead to i a decrease in electrode performance energy efficiency and or electrode lifespan and or ii the formation of chemical by products and or ph fluctuations of the product water cohen et al 2013 2015 he et al 2016 lee et al 2014 while others can be employed to improve desalination performance through pseudocapacitive intercalation effects and formation of charged species in this study three types of faradaic reactions are categorized as described below type i are oxidation reactions that occur at the anode including carbon electrode oxidation chloride oxidation water oxidation and other particular contaminant oxidation reactions such as oxidation of inorganic ions and organic matters of these reactions the carbon oxidation reactions have attracted the most attention given the deleterious effects that may accrue such as pore structure impairment and mass loss with subsequent decrease in carbon electrode longevity and deterioration of cdi performance cohen et al 2013 wouters et al 2013 type ii are reduction reactions that take place at the cathode with oxygen reduction being the most common while it has been reported that the oxygen reduction reaction leads to the asymmetric distribution of potential of the anode and cathode with subsequent acceleration of the anodic carbon oxidation reactions he et al 2016 the in situ generation of by products such as h2o2 as a result of oxygen reduction might be constructively used for water disinfection possibly via combination with uv irradiation and or degradation of organic contaminants provided that h2o2 can be effectively activated to produce more powerful oxidants in addition cathodic reduction reactions may contribute to the removal of heavy metals from water as a result of the possible deposition of the metals at the electrode type iii are faradaic ion storage processes in which pseudocapacitive intercalation effects are used to store ions through reversible redox reactions instead of electrostatic storage in the edls at the electrode electrolyte interfaces chen et al 2017a lee et al 2014 smith 2017 su and hatton 2017 due to the superior ion electrosorption capacity of intercalation electrodes compared to traditional carbon electrodes faradaic ion storage processes have received considerable attention recently lee et al 2014 some of the most commonly investigated intercalation electrode materials are sodium transition metal oxides natmo tm mn ti fe ni co etc see fig 3b sodium iron pyrophosphate prussian blue analogues for the capture of cations and conductive polymers polypyrrole or polyaniline see fig 3c ag acl biocl for the bonding of anions han et al 2015 palomares et al 2012 porada et al 2017 su et al 2016 in the current review we provide a comprehensive description of the possible faradaic reactions that could occur in cdi desalination processes we also provide insight into both the positive and negative effects of these reactions guidelines and strategies that may be used to reduce or eliminate the negative side effects of faradaic reactions are presented and approaches to best utilizing faradaic reactions in a positive manner are described 2 types of faradaic reactions as introduced above three major types of faradaic reactions are addressed in this review article namely i anodic reactions associated with oxidation of the carbon electrode chloride and water iii cathodic reactions particularly those involving oxygen reduction and iii faradaic ion storage occurring on particular redox active electrodes 2 1 anodic oxidation reactions 2 1 1 carbon oxidation of all the anodic faradaic reactions in cdi systems those involving carbon electrode oxidation are of most importance given their potential for negative impact on the performance and longevity of the system the standard electrode potential for carbon oxidation is 0 21 v vs she maass et al 2008 oh et al 2008 which is likely to be within the cdi potential window when the cdi cell is operated at 1 2 v or higher as such during the cdi desalination process the carbon anode might not only electrochemically store anions but may also sacrificially take part in the oxidation process with the carbon electrode initially incorporating oxygen containing groups and potentially eventually being converted at least in part into co2 which leads to carbon mass loss and deterioration in cdi performance these oxidation processes may be a consequence of both direct oxidation when the anode is polarized according to eqs 1 3 ayranci and conway 2001 bayram and ayranci 2011 lee et al 2010 maass et al 2008 oh et al 2008 and indirect oxidation as a result of the anodic generation of oxidants such as chlorine and hydroxyl radicals 1 c h 2 o c o 2 h 2 e 2 c h 2 o c oh h e 3 c 2 h 2 o co 2 4 h 4 e e 0 0 21 v she strategies to evaluate the oxidation of the cdi electrodes are based on monitoring the changes in the functional groups of electrodes using methods such as x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps scanning electron microscopy sem with energy dispersive x ray edx mapping fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir acid base titration and cyclic voltammetry bouhadana et al 2011b chen et al 2013 cohen et al 2013 2015 the changes in the xps oxygen o 1s and carbon c 1s response to the charging and discharging cycling of the carbon anode and cathode were also demonstrated cohen et al 2013 it was found that the intensity of the o 1s spectrum increased while the c 1s intensity decreased in the carbon anode after long term operation indicating that the anode acquired more oxygen containing groups during the desalination process cohen et al 2013 in a similar work utilizing xps analysis it was found that various new oxygen containing species were formed on the carbon electrode surface after prolonged operation although the types of these oxygen species were not fully identified bouhadana et al 2011b cohen et al 2015 also reported that the oxygen composition in the anode increased from 3 77 to 8 52 wt following long term cdi operation 20 days based on sem edx results by performing cyclic voltammetry measurements haro et al 2011 revealed that the intensity of the cathodic anodic peaks assigned to quinone hydroquinone groups on the carbon anode increased following several cycles of cdi operation confirming the gradual oxidation of the carbon to oxygen containing groups in addition thermal analysis of these anodes suggest that the appearance of high temperature desorption bands generally identified as co evolving groups could be attributed to the incorporation of carbonyl type groups on the carbon electrodes these observations agree with the acid base titration results reported by chen et al 2013 who found that the amount of cooh groups present in a carbon electrode increased from 0 027 to 0 391 mmol g 1 after use increase in resistivity and decrease in surface area and pore volume during the prolonged charging discharging cycles have also been associated with the anodic oxidation of carbon electrodes cohen et al 2015 duan et al 2015a gao et al 2014 haro et al 2011 omosebi et al 2014 recent results also demonstrated that oxidation of the carbon anode induced changes in pore structure with a decrease in the volume of the micropores bayram and ayranci 2011 chen et al 2013 the parameter recognized to contribute most strongly to ion electrosorption capacity porada et al 2013a as such the prolonged anodic oxidation of carbon electrodes can be expected to lead to the deterioration of electrode structural properties with resultant desalination performance decline gao et al 2014 omosebi et al 2014 therefore approaches to the reduction and or the elimination of this faradaic side reaction are critically required 2 1 2 chloride and water oxidation anodic oxidation of cl and water may occur during the cdi electrochemical treatment of brackish waters provided anodic potentials are sufficiently positive to drive these redox reactions the mechanisms involving the anodic oxidation of cl are as follows i the direct oxidation of cl at the anode yields free chlorine i e cl2 eq 4 ii cl2 is rapidly hydrolyzed and disproportionates to form hypochlorous acid hclo eq 5 and iii hclo and its deprotonated form clo eq 6 can be further oxidized to chlorate clo3 anodically eq 7 additionally the direct oxidation of cl to clo3 may occur at the anode eq 8 comninellis and nerini 1995 jung et al 2010 martínez huitle and brillas 2009 martinez huitle et al 2015 szpyrkowicz et al 1994 4 2 cl cl 2 2 e e 0 1 36 v she 5 cl 2 h 2 o hclo h cl 6 hclo h clo 7 6 hclo 3 h 2 o 2 clo 3 4 cl 12 cl 3 2 o 2 6 e e 0 0 46 v she 8 cl 3 h 2 o clo 3 6 h 6 e e 0 1 45 v she the formation of clo3 during cdi operation has been confirmed by lado et al 2013 and wouters et al 2013 who showed that a minimal amount of clo3 accumulated during the first 5 min whilst rapid removal of cl occurred over this same time period with cl concentration approaching steady state following 10 min of charging the production rate of clo3 increased significantly it was also found that the more cl that was removed from solution the more extensive was the generation of clo3 in the cdi system wouters et al 2013 this result suggests that cl associated with the anode surface rather than free cl in solution was the main contributor to the generation of clo3 it should be noted that while a relatively low cathode potential of 1 74 v vs she was reported in the above work neither the anode potential nor charging voltage were provided as such quantification of clo3 generated under more typical cdi operating conditions with well defined anode potential is required to properly interpret these results as noted earlier the anodic oxidation of water eqs 9 and 10 may also occur barrera díaz et al 2014 martinez huitle et al 2015 moreira et al 2017 sires et al 2014 9 2 h 2 o o 2 4 h 4 e e 0 1 23 v she 10 h2o ho h e e 0 2 80 v she although the oxygen evolution reaction eq 9 exhibits a relatively lower standard redox potential than that for the chloride oxidation reaction eq 4 the oxidation of cl is likely to occur preferentially in the cdi system in view of its lower overpotential and the abundance of cl in the vicinity of the anode during the electrosorption process abdel aal et al 1993 balaji et al 2009 bennett 1980 hlushkou et al 2016 knust et al 2013 to limit the extent of current leakage due to the occurrence of water electrolysis the cdi process is typically operated at charging voltages below the limit of 1 23 v porada et al 2013b it is critical however that the anode potential be monitored over the duration of cdi operation since it is likely that i an asymmetric distribution of potentials of the electrodes will occur with a positive shift in potential of the anode and ii significant ph fluctuations in the vicinity of the anode will occur an anodic potential sufficient to induce oxidation of cl to cl2 may be used if there is a specific desire to generate cl2 for either disinfection or ammonia oxidation purposes though there will obviously be a risk of current leakage due to water oxidation 2 2 cathodic reduction reactions 2 2 1 dissolved oxygen reduction dissolved oxygen do is ubiquitous in feed waters to cdi units as a result faradaic oxygen reduction reactions occur at the cathode with the possible oxygen reduction reactions shown in eqs 12 14 dissolved oxygen can be reduced either via two electron transfer to hydrogen peroxide h2o2 eq 12 with e 0 0 69 v she or four electron reduction to water via eq 14 with e 0 1 23 v she shapira et al 2016 in view of the evidence for the presence of h2o2 in cdi systems he et al 2016 the cathodic reduction of oxygen most likely occurs via the two electron transfer pathway according to eq 12 12 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 e 0 0 69 v she 13 h 2 o 2 2 h 2 e 2 h 2 o e 0 1 78 v she 14 o 2 4 h 4 e 2 h 2 o e 0 1 23 v she it has been reported that the cdi cathode potential is typically in the range 0 3 to 0 6 v vs she suggesting that cathodic oxygen reduction is inevitable recent batch mode cdi studies have revealed that decrease in do concentration is accompanied by formation of h2o2 he et al 2016 the reduction of do concentration follows pseudo first order kinetics i e 15 d o 2 d t k o 2 where k represents the pseudo first order rate constant for do decrease as reported by he et al 2016 the k values increased from 5 4 10 5 to 2 7 10 3 s 1 with increase in charging voltage from 0 5 to 1 5 v the steady state concentration of h2o2 varied significantly with the charging voltage with h2o2 concentration reaching as high as 60 μm when the charging voltage was 1 2 v as shown in fig 4 kim et al 2016b also reported the cathodic generation of h2o2 on operation of a cdi unit in single pass mode it was found that approximately 0 1 mg of h2o2 was produced over 50 operation cycles at a charging voltage of 1 2 v electrochemical analysis confirmed that cathodic oxygen reduction was thermodynamically favorable even at very low charging voltages e g 0 6 v 2 2 2 carbon reduction carbon electrodes not only undergo anodic oxidation but also experience cathodic reduction or hydrogenation eq 16 resulting in the introduction of additional ch groups to the carbon electrodes soffer and folman 1972 although several research groups have mentioned the possibility of occurrence of carbon reduction in their cdi systems chen et al 2013 lado et al 2014 there has been no conclusive evidence presented to date to confirm the occurrence of this reaction nor its standard potential 16 c h 2 o e c h oh the range of redox potentials over which the main faradaic reactions occur on the cdi anodes and cathodes and typical electrode working potentials as a function of cell voltage are shown in fig 5 holubowitch et al 2017 the potential map provides a very useful practical guide for optimization of cell voltage such that side faradaic reactions are minimized 2 3 faradaic ion storage faradaic ion storage processes involve the application of intercalation electrodes mainly transition metal containing material or conductive polymer for ion harvesting from saline waters the ion storage mechanisms involve the trapping of ions into the crystallographic sites of the intercalation materials via redox reactions with this process fundamentally different from the edl charging process occurring within conventional carbon electrodes due to the exemplary salt electro adsorption capacity and potential ion selectivity of these electrodes faradaic ion storage processes are attracting increasing attention interest in faradaic desalination has been inspired by sodium and lithium ion battery systems transition metal containing materials have been most commonly used for cathode construction while preparation with sodium manganese oxide na0 44mno2 na2mn5o10 lithium manganese oxide lixmn2o4 sodium iron pyrophosphate na2fep2o7 sodium nickel hexacyanoferrate nanihcf and sodium iron hexacyanoferrate nafehcf are of most interest in view of their capacity to trap alkali metal ions such as na and li but lower preference for ions such as mg2 and ca2 chen et al 2017a 2017b lee et al 2014 2017 missoni et al 2016 porada et al 2017 examples of reactions occurring at these cathodes are provided in eqs 20 and 21 20 na 0 44 x mno 2 x na x e na 0 44 mno 2 21 x li li 1 x mn 1 x m iii n o 2 iv x e limn iv mn o 4 iii there appears to be much less choice for the anode silver conductive polymers or biocl have been reported to be effective for the capture of chloride ions the most common anions in the saline water chen et al 2017a 2017b missoni et al 2016 examples of reactions taking place at the anodes are shown in eqs 22 24 22 ag cl agcl e 23 x cl x pp 0 x pp cl x e 24 bi bi 2 o 3 3 cl 3 biocl 3 e detailed discussion of the applications and desalination performances of faradaic electrodes is presented in section 5 1 3 negative effects of faradaic reactions as mentioned earlier the aging of carbon electrodes due particularly to anodic oxidation of electrode materials over long term cdi operation results in numerous side effects such as desalination performance decline water quality fluctuations and undesirable energy consumption 3 1 desalination performance decline cdi cells are usually depending on the design initially symmetrical with the potentials of the anodes and cathodes identical assuming they possess the same surface area and pore distribution bouhadana et al 2011a cohen et al 2015 cohen et al 2011 after a number of cycles of charging and discharging operation the distribution of potential between the anodes and cathodes ceases to be symmetrical due to the occurrence of faradaic side reactions e g the reduction of oxygen that inevitably occurs at the cathode with a positive shift in potential of the anodes consequently the anode potential may exceed its potential limit of stability leading to the occurrence of anodic carbon electrode oxidation in turn changes in the structure of the electrodes due to anodic oxidation may further drive the cdi cell away from symmetric behavior with the occurrence of cl and water oxidation see section 2 for further details finally resulting in decline in the charge efficiency and the desalination performance there have been several studies showing the decline in desalination capacity and charge efficiency during prolonged cdi operation bouhadana et al 2011a cohen et al 2013 gao et al 2015b lu et al 2017 gao et al 2015b conducted a detailed investigation with cdi cells equipped with 16 pairs of pristine carbon xerogel electrodes at charging discharging voltages of 1 2 0 and 0 8 0 v as shown in fig 6 a and b both the electrosorption capacity and charge efficiency declined significantly with an increase in the cycle number during the prolonged cycling tests a more rapid decline in the desalination performance was observed on increase in the charging voltage from 0 8 to 1 2 v similarly lu et al 2017 observed severe cdi performance degradation with the salt electrosorption capacity declining from 7 3 to 0 5 mg g 1 after 70 cycles in symmetric 1 2 0 v operation another recent study also reported that the charge efficiency dropped sharply from 92 to 69 5 and was accompanied by a dramatic increase in cell voltage from 0 6 to 4 8 v due to the occurrence of inevitable faradaic reactions despite these changes the rate of ion adsorption increased significantly by around 7 times liang et al 2017 an indicator of cdi performance decline after prolonged charge discharge cycles relates to the occurrence of a so called inversion effect which was reflected by the occurrence of ion desorption i e a rise in effluent conductivity during charging in turn ions are adsorbed and trapped in the electrodes i e effluent conductivity decreases on cell discharge bouhadana et al 2011a 3 2 water quality fluctuations as mentioned above the occurrence of faradaic reactions at the cdi electrodes may lead to ph fluctuations and the formation of chemical byproducts leading to severe fluctuations in the effluent water quality he et al 2016 reported that the effluent ph varied significantly with different charging voltages in a batch mode cdi cell upon applying a charging voltage of 0 9 v the ph rapidly climbed to 10 and then reached steady state while the effluent ph increased slightly and then decreased rapidly at charging voltages higher than 1 2 v which was in agreement with other studies lado et al 2014 lee et al 2010 cohen et al 2013 also reported that over long term cdi operation 13 days the ph shifted to more acidic conditions with ph fluctuations particularly severe during charging at 0 9 v while the ph fluctuations were insignificant and within the ph range of 6 7 when the cdi cell was charged at a lower voltage of 0 7 v interestingly the ph in the vicinity of the electrodes was significantly different to that in the bulk solution a highly inhomogenous ph environment appeared during the water desalination processes with the near anode and near cathode ph reaching 2 4 and 10 3 under a typical operation voltage of 1 2 v respectively holubowitch et al 2017 litmus paper was used in an earlier study to roughly measure the near electrode ph values and revealed that the ph close to the anode can decrease to as low as 2 3 while the ph at cathode can climb higher than 10 choi 2014 according to eqs 12 and 14 the oxygen reduction reactions at the cathode consume h with these reactions the dominant faradaic processes occurring when the voltage is relatively low e g 1 0 v resulting in ph increase lee et al 2010 with an increase in the charging voltage carbon electrode oxidation reactions start to occur eq 3 with the release of h into solution as the charging voltage further increases cl and water oxidation could take place at the anode eqs 4 8 most of these oxidation reactions are capable of generating h resulting in a decrease in the ph of the treated stream other interpretations of observed ph variations on operation of cdi systems could be attributed to the difference in ion mobility of h oh and other ions and or the non faradaic preferable electrosorption of these ions andres and yoshihara 2016 han et al 2013 porada et al 2013b interestingly dykstra et al 2017 presented a model enabling the prediction of ph changes in the mcdi cell they found that although the different mobilities of various ions contributed to the ph fluctuation of the effluent faradaic reactions played a more important role in relation to ph changes during cdi operation bouhadana et al 2011b reported that the ph fluctuation was dramatically reduced when replacing dissolved air with nitrogen by bubbling nitrogen gas into the solution suggesting that the ph fluctuation depends strongly on faradaic reactions involving oxygen at the electrodes while it has been reported that change of ph exerted an insignificant influence on salt removal during cdi operation porada et al 2012a significant effluent ph fluctuations remain problematic for example when cations such as ca2 and mg2 are present in the feed water scale formation on the surface of the cathodes is likely to be a problem particularly at higher phs where carbonate minerals containing these cations readily form choi and kang 2016 it is also worthwhile mentioning that the stability of some of the redox active electrodes such as those made from transition metal oxide carbon composites is likely to depend strongly on ph a rapid decrease of ph in the vicinity of the anodes could lead to the undesirable leakage of metal ions from the metal oxide composites potentially posing significant health risks to consumers in addition to ph fluctuations faradaic reactions may also generate undesired byproducts during charging and discharging cycles one example is the production of clo3 which as described earlier could be generated upon the oxidation of cl at the anode wouters et al 2013 the presence of high concentrations of clo3 in effluents represents serious health risks for both humans and animals srinivasan and sorial 2009 with deleterious effects including oxidative damage to erythrocytes and mutagenic activities in mammalian cells jung et al 2010 richardson et al 2007 due to these toxic effects the who has proposed a threshold limit for clo3 in drinking waters of 0 7 mg l 1 edition 2011 as such effective strategies must be implemented to prevent the generation of clo3 and its derivative by products if cdi is applied to drinking water purification 3 3 energy loss faradaic reactions also referred to as parasitic electrochemical charge transfer leakage currents and ohmic losses are the main reasons that the energy efficiency declines possibly by 20 30 over months of operation farmer et al 1996 recent studies of the energy loss mechanisms in cdi units under constant current cc operation reveal that resistive and parasitic losses primarily due to leakage currents associated with faradaic reactions at the electrodes are the two major sources of energy loss hemmatifar et al 2016 results of these studies indicate that resistive energy loss was dominant under high current conditions as it increases approximately linearly with current for fixed charge transfer on the other hand parasitic loss dominated in low current cases as the electrode is held at higher voltages for a longer period of time compared to operation in cc mode the energy loss in constant voltage cv mode is more significant mainly due to the higher resistive dissipation as well as the longer charging time spent at higher oxidizing potentials qu et al 2016 4 strategies to reduce eliminate faradaic side effects as described previously faradaic reactions may cause a range of negative side effects over prolonged cdi operation including desalination performance decline water quality fluctuations and undesirable energy consumption a variety of strategies may be envisaged to reduce eliminate these faradaic side effects including optimization of the cdi configuration modification of cdi operation mode and fabrication of novel cdi electrodes 4 1 alternative cdi configurations 4 1 1 membrane capacitive deionization membrane capacitive deionization mcdi is a significant improvement over conventional cdi and involves the incorporation of ion exchange membranes iems in front of the cdi electrodes thereby enabling more selective ion adsorption and desorption li et al 2008 incorporation of iems in cdi is also recognized to be an effective method to alleviate particular faradaic reactions including the cathodic reduction of oxygen and anodic oxidation of carbon omosebi et al 2014 tang et al 2017 compared the faradaic reactions occurring in cdi and mcdi cells equipped with carbon cloth electrodes through investigation of h2o2 production and do decay during charging h2o2 was generated with a steady state concentration of up to 60 μm in the cdi cell due to do reduction at the cathode eq 12 while less than 2 μm h2o2 was observed in the mcdi cell this was consistent with the observation that do decreased rapidly to 1 mg l 1 in the cdi cell while insignificant decay of do was observed in the mcdi cell as reported previously the oxygen diffusivity in neosepta and nafion membranes is two orders of magnitude smaller than that in water ogumi et al 1984 consequently iems incorporated in cdi units act as efficient barriers to transport of do to the cathode thereby inhibiting oxygen reduction reactions at the cathode in the mcdi cell the elimination of cathodic oxygen reduction could contribute to the alleviation of the positive shift of potential distribution to the anode over long term cdi operation bouhadana et al 2011b cohen et al 2013 more interestingly some researchers presented the effects of faradaic reactions on the long term performance of cdi and mcdi units equipped with carbon xerogel electrodes omosebi et al 2014 unlike cdi which was found to experience severe desalination performance decline in a short period of time mcdi exhibited stable performance over the 50 h of operation post testing evaluation of the used cdi anode showed a positive shift of e pzc by 0 5 v after 50 h operation while the voltage increase of the anode e pzc was only 0 2 v in the mcdi cell these results clearly demonstrate that the carbon oxidation reactions were suppressed by the incorporation of iems into the cdi unit more details in section 3 1 4 1 2 inverted capacitive deionization gao et al 2015b proposed a new cdi configuration termed inverted capacitive deionization i cdi with the aim to diminish side effects of faradaic reactions and achieve stable and efficient desalination performance the i cdi system involves the use of an anode with net negative surface charge and a cathode with net positive surface charge interestingly salt removal in this novel i cdi system was achieved in a manner completely opposite to traditional cdi systems with cell charging leading to ion desorption from the edls of the electrodes while cell discharging by short circuiting the anode and cathode led to ion adsorption fig 6a and b most importantly desalination performance was shown to be maintained for over 600 h an improvement in lifetime of the system by 530 compared to that of a conventional cdi system operated under similar conditions in a more recent work gao et al 2015a developed an amine treated anode with nh3 groups providing positive surface charge and acid treated carbon cathode with coo groups providing negative surface charge and achieved a desalination capacity of 5 3 mg g 1 at charging discharging voltages of 1 1 0 v with this performance representing a significant improvement with regard to both salt removal capacity and working voltage window compared to the first generation of i cdi systems wu et al 2016 further fabricated an i cdi system equipped with an activated carbon cathode modified by poly 4 vinylpyridine and a carbon anode treated with nitric acid and achieved a remarkably high salt removal capacity of 20 6 mg g 1 in i cdi systems the oxidation of the anode is not regarded as an adverse effect as is the case in conventional cdi systems indeed oxygen containing functional groups formed during the carbon oxidation process increase the net negative surface charge thereby further expanding the available internal working voltage window for salt separation performance fig 7 c as a consequence the formation of oxide thin layers at the anode could contribute to a significant improvement in cdi desalination stability in long term operation paving a new way for high performance cdi 4 1 3 flow electrode capacitive deionization flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi is an innovative mcdi method using suspended carbon slurry that flow in the flow channels carved on the current collectors fcdi exhibits a number of distinctive benefits for water desalination i e excellent ion adsorption capacity continuous desalination behavior and potentially energy and resource recovery if designed and operated appropriately it has been reported recently that the anode ph could decrease to 1 5 while cathode ph increased to 12 5 when the fcdi was operated in a separated flow electrode mode anode and cathode slurry flowing separately nativ et al 2017 however when using the combined flow electrode the anode and cathode flow electrodes mixing outside the fcdi cell the faradaic reaction could be partly supressed with the combined flow electrode ph stabilized at around 7 and the energy consumption much lower compared to the separated flow electrode cdi 4 1 4 flow by and flow through capacitive deionization flow by and flow through cdi are two types of common cdi configurations guyes et al 2017 suss et al 2012 a recent comparison of the long term stability of these two configurations during desalination indicated that use of a flow by configuration could enhance the cdi cell stability by up to 360 compared to the flow through configuration with a lifetime of 18 days compared to 5 days cohen et al 2015 as such flow by cdi is considered to be a better configuration than flow through cdi mainly due to the presence of a hydrodynamic diffuse boundary layer which prevents rapid transport of dissolved oxygen to the surface of the cathode the limitation of oxygen reduction on the cathode results in the reduction of an asymmetric distribution of potentials in flow by cells 4 2 operational approaches 4 2 1 optimization of the voltage window as reported by lu et al 2017 cdi underwent significant performance decline even when operated at a voltage as low as 1 2 v to mitigate the performance decline they tested a number of different charging and discharging voltages and finally obtained the optimal operation voltage window to be charging at 0 8 v and discharging at 0 4 v the cdi system exhibited a slightly lower desalination capacity 6 3 mg g 1 under this voltage window compared to that of the 1 2 0 v experiment 7 3 mg g 1 nevertheless it is an important finding that carbon oxidation was inhibited in this optimal voltage window with negligible performance degradation observed even after more than 70 operation cycles 4 2 2 constant current operation to reduce faradaic reactions one straightforward and effective method is to apply a lower charging voltage to the cdi cells indeed there always exists a conflict between mitigation of anodic oxidation of carbon electrodes and enhancement of desalination performance based on the gouy chapman stern model higher charging voltage applied to the cdi cell results in improvement of ion electrosorption capacity while the higher voltage could lead to increased anodic oxidation of the carbon electrodes over prolonged cdi operation zhao et al 2009 as such cc mode is more favorable than cv mode since electrodes are exposed to higher voltages for less time resulting in lower resistive and parasitic losses during cc compared to cv operation qu et al 2016 4 2 3 periodic electrode polarity reversal it has been found that the decline in cdi electrosorption capacity on aging of the carbon electrodes can be recovered to a large extent by periodically reversing the cell polarity cohen et al 2015 farmer et al 1996 cohen et al 2015 have examined this possibility and found that when the cdi unit was operated periodically according to the following four steps i 0 9 v ii 0 v iii 0 9 v iv 0 v with each step lasting for 30 min the desalination performance showed no obvious decline even after running for 34 days while control experiments with the charging discharging cycle of 0 9 v 0 v achieved only 5 days of stable operation the ph fluctuations were only in the range of 5 8 7 indicating reasonable stability of the cell unlike the regular behavior of the conventional cdi with one electrode serving as the anode and the other as the cathode during charging in periodic polarity reversing mode each electrode periodically serves as anode or cathode this operation provides an identical working condition for both electrodes in long term operation thereby avoiding the asymmetric shifting of the e pzc between two electrodes and thus suppressing the faradaic reactions especially reducing the rate and extent of the oxidation of the electrodes cohen et al 2015 similarly gao et al 2017 reported desalination performance of the cdi stack equipped with carbon xerogel electrodes by alternating polarization of 1 2 0 v long term operation suggested that this operational mode could eliminate the formation of inversion peaks thereby effectively extending the cycling stability for salt ion removal the surface charge of both carbon electrodes gradually shifted from positively charged to negatively charged due to the inevitable and irreversible faradaic reactions as each electrode alternately served as cdi anode during this alternating polarization process these studies also demonstrated for the first time that the highest salt adsorption capacity was attained after 200 h of operation when the positively and negatively charged surface sites on the electrodes became nearly equal 4 2 4 deoxygenation cell as demonstrated previously the presence of dissolved oxygen results in undesirable oxygen reduction reactions at the cathode even under a low operating voltage use of a low cost deoxygenation cell to remove dissolved oxygen before the water enters the cdi cell results in inhibition of the oxygen reduction reaction and suppresses its competition with the cation capacitive adsorption thereby resulting in an enhanced salt adsorption capacity and reduced energy consumption holubowitch et al 2017 4 3 novel cdi electrode fabrication recent studies have demonstrated that the impregnation of certain types of polymers could effectively suppress the faradaic effects choi and choi 2010 fabricated carbon electrodes by mixing the activated carbon powder with polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf binder and showed that the faradaic current decreased significantly with increase in the pvdf content of the carbon electrodes further investigations suggested that the polymer binder reduced the redox activity of the functional groups i e carbonyl or quinone type oxygen functional groups on the carbon surface hsieh and teng 2002 in addition a novel polymer impregnated carbon anode involving coating a mixture of the type i strong base anion resin n methyl 2pyrrolidone nmp and pvdf onto carbon cloth was fabricated by gao et al 2016 the experimental results showed that stable desalination performance and higher charge efficiency with much less significant effluent ph fluctuations were obtained using this novel anode meanwhile the e pzc of the pristine anode shifted positively by 0 26 v whereas the polymer coated anode showed minimal obvious e pzc shift after prolonged operation demonstrating that the coverage of anion exchange polymer layers could effectively mitigate the anodic oxidation of carbon electrodes srimuk et al 2016 chemically modified activated carbon ac electrodes with titania which could provide additional catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reactions at the cathode and preventing oxidization of the carbon electrode the study revealed that titania coated ac electrodes exhibited higher desalination capacity and better long time stability than pure ac electrodes in oxygen saturated nacl solution after 15 operating cycles the ac titania hybrid electrode presented a comparable high salt removal capacity of 8 mg g 1 whereas cdi with the pure ac electrodes lost almost all the desalination capacity it was shown that pure ac electrodes exhibited the oxygen reduction reaction in a two electron transfer and produced h2o2 which was then used to attack the carbon electrodes resulting in a decline in desalination performance in contrast ac titania electrodes consumed the oxygen via a three electron transfer reaction that suppressed the formation of h2o2 preventing the carbon electrode from being oxidized and partially reducing the deterioration of the cdi desalination performance 5 positive applications of faradaic reactions although faradaic reactions are generally recognized to cause serious problems including electrode deterioration and associated desalination performance decline water quality fluctuations and undesirable energy loss some faradaic reactions may contribute to the enhancement of desalination performance and or may contribute to the achievement of cdi multifunctionality such as simultaneous desalination and disinfection micropollutant degradation these possibilities are discussed briefly below 5 1 desalination performance enhancement 5 1 1 faradaic ion storage over the past few years researchers have been focusing on optimization of traditional cdi systems equipped with static porous carbon electrodes and have achieved salt adsorption capacities approaching 15 mg g 1 for flow carbon electrode system a slightly higher salt adsorption capacity of 20 mg g 1 is expected due to the low intrinsic charge storage capacitance of porous carbon electrodes however a cdi device based on the mechanism of non faradaic capacitive adsorption ion storage in the edls of carbon micropores suffers from the limitation of improvement of salt adsorption capacity as mentioned in section 2 3 an alternative means of enhancing ion storage is to employ innovative pseudocapacitive electrodes which extract ions through reversible faradaic reactions that occur on intercalation of ionic species within the electrodes with advantages particularly in the desalination of highly concentrated saline water and in the selective harvesting of particular ions a comparison of desalination performance among electrodes based on edl and faradaic ion storage mechanisms is presented in table 1 following the pioneering attempts at using pure faradaic based cdi cells in which sodium manganese oxide na2mn5o10 was employed as the cathode for sodium capture while ag agcl served as the anode for chloride capture pasta et al 2012 a modified hybrid cdi cell was proposed by lee et al 2014 this hybrid cdi cell was composed of a faradaic type cathode sodium manganese oxide materials na4mn9o18 and a non faradaic type anode porous carbon materials and exhibited a desalination capacity of 31 2 mg g 1 twice as high as that for pure carbon capacitive electrodes in their subsequent work kim et al 2016a sodium iron pyrophosphate na2fep2o7 electrodes which served as the faradaic cathode were developed with this hybrid cdi system achieving a reasonably high electrosorption capacity 30 2 mg g 1 porada et al 2017 prepared a novel porous electrode which contained redox active nickel hexacyanoferrate nihcf nanoparticles and used them for electrochemical water desalination when applying a current density of 2 8 a m 2 a high electrosorption capacity 34 mg g 1 was achieved 1 5 times higher than that of the cdi with carbon electrodes 12 5 mg g 1 meanwhile the current efficiency reached 80 95 and energy costs of desalination were significantly reduced chen et al 2017a b reported a similar faradaic capacitive deionization cell based on na0 44mno2 cathode and ag agcl anode for chemical intercalation and deintercalation of sodium and chloride ions with this electrode system exhibiting a stable and reversible desalination capacity of 57 4 mg g 1 after 100 cycles of operation with an excellent charge efficiency of 97 9 95 6 during the charging discharging process more recently anther novel faradaic capacitive based desalination system was developed with sodium nickel hexacyanoferrate nanihcf and sodium iron hcf nafehcf as the electrodes lee et al 2017 one interesting aspect of this cell is that desalination took place not only during the charging step but also the discharging step achieving the continuous desalination brackish water with a high desalination capacity 59 9 mg g 1 and efficient energy consumption 5 10 w hh mol 1 following this work kim et al 2017 developed a similar cdi system using identical copper hexacyanoferrate cuhcf electrodes to bind sodium and chloride separated via the anion exchange membrane with this cell realizing a desalination capacity of nearly 100 mg g 1 most recently dual ion electrochemical desalination systems using na0 44mno2 as the sodium ion faradaic electrode and biocl as the chloride ion faradaic electrode have been explored an extremely high salt capture capacity of 68 5 mg g 1 and a charge efficiency of 97 7 were achieved chen et al 2017b with these results suggesting a promising future for highly saline water desalination while a variety of electrodes have been fabricated for the selective intercalation of cations only a few have been developed for the capture of anions missoni et al 2016 developed an alternative limn2o4 polypyrrole electrochemical cell to selectively capture lithium chloride from seawater or other natural brine solution chloride ions were successfully extracted by the polypyrrole coated carbon felt anode while the lithium ions were effectively harvested in the limn2o4 cathode upon applying a low potential difference of 0 6 1 1 v a competitive charge efficiency of 50 with energy consumption of 5 10 w hh mol 1 was achieved with excellent reproducibility over 200 cycles in addition to removal of salts cations and anions from aqueous solution faradaic ion storage has also been applied to the selective separation of charged organic matter from electrolyte solutions containing strong inorganic salts as well as dilute organic pollutants su et al 2016 developed a system comprised of carbon electrodes coated with redox active material pvf cnt which exhibited excellent selectivity towards organic anions carboxylates coo sulfonates so3 and phosphonates po3 2 with a separation factor of more than 140 and 3000 times compared to inorganic anions pf6 and clo4 in aqueous and organic solutions respectively in later studies a similar system with organometallic functionalized redox cathode and ferrocene modified redox anode was used in an asymmetric electrochemical capacitive cell and demonstrated a remarkable degree of selectivity for the retention of charged micro pollutants such as pesticides endocrine disruptors and pharmaceuticals with a current density of up to 96 their findings provide a promising and energy efficient pathway for the capture recovery of value added products and or the separation isolation of dilute but highly toxic organic pollutants from aqueous or organic systems su et al 2017 although faradaic ion storage is a promising area and one in which there is considerable interest several problems still remain to be solved i most intercalation electrodes are only efficient for capture of particular ions for example sodium manganese oxide nmo can selectively take up na while nihcf shows affinity for k while attractive for removal of particular ions this selectivity limits their application with regard to treatment of source waters containing multiple types of ions including na k ca2 and mg2 ii there is a lack of materials that can serve as the anion storage electrodes in aqueous media although ag agcl was found to be a highly efficient cl ion capture electrode its further application is likely to be limited by commercial constraints more studies should be focused on the development of cost effective efficient and stable intercalation electrodes for anions such as cl f no3 so4 2 from saline waters iii although researchers have claimed that these faradaic electrodes can be operated for hundreds of cycles without significant decrease in desalination performance undesired leakage of metal ions from the intercalation materials might occur during prolonged operation potentially causing risks when used for drinking water desalination bouchard et al 2011 dion et al 2016 5 1 2 electron mediators another innovative application of faradaic reactions in desalination enhancement involves the introduction of redox active electron shuttles such as quinones into fcdi systems where aqueous suspensions of activated carbon particles flow through a channel carved on the current collector ma et al 2016 the quinone species in the flow electrode acted as an electron mediator with redox transformation between the reduced hydroquinone h2q and oxidized benzoquinone q forms of the quinone occurring at the electrode surface and electrolyte interface fig 8 a the presence of the h2q q couple in the flowing carbon suspension significantly accelerated the charge transfer between the carbon particles and current collectors thereby enhancing both the salt electrosorption and desorption processes fig 8b on applying a charging voltage of 1 2 v the average salt removal rate increased by 131 on adding h2q at a concentration of 14 mm to a 1 wt activated carbon suspension with a similar positive effect observed during the discharging process this result represents a breakthrough in the development of fcdi with the application of faradaic reactions providing a highly efficient means for enhancing desalination performance 5 2 other faradaic applications 5 2 1 disinfection as described previously active species such as hclo ho and h2o2 can be generated through the occurrence of faradaic reactions in a cdi cell with these species potentially of use in water disinfection laxman et al 2015 evaluated the bacterial inactivation properties of a cdi cell with activated carbon cloth electrodes and observed an approximate 3 fold reduction in the number of viable bacterial colonies from 3 104 cfu ml 1 in the feed water following cdi operation another group fabricated a novel electrode by impregnating cationic nanohybrids of graphene oxide grafted quaternized chitosan to activated carbon electrodes go qc ac wang et al 2015 a cdi cell equipped with this novel electrode achieved an ultrahigh inactivation rate i e 99 9999 or 6 log reduction of escherichia coli during water desalination however a cdi unit with pristine activated carbon electrodes removed less than 82 8 of the viable bacteria present in feed waters although the mode of antimicrobial action by cdi has not yet been clearly elucidated the active oxidants e g hclo and ho generated during the electrochemical process could play an important roles in this process jeong et al 2006 in addition the h2o2 generated via cathodic oxygen reduction if combined with uv irradiation or o3 would also be expected to result in bacterial inactivation indeed previous studies have demonstrated that low concentrations of h2o2 20 150 μm combined with uv or o3 lead to enhancement in bacterial inactivation by 0 5 2 0 log units cho et al 2011 cho and yoon 2006 lanao et al 2008 rubio et al 2013 5 2 2 contaminant sequestration organic and inorganic micropollutants such as endocrine disrupting chemicals heavy metals nitrate and arsenic are prevalent in many water sources and in treated wastewaters which otherwise might be recycled cdi apart from removing inorganic salts by non faradaic means may also contribute to the removal of these pollutants through a combination of faradaic and non faradaic processes arsenic is naturally present in groundwaters at concentrations ranging from less than 0 5 μg l 1 to more than 5 mg l 1 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 groundwaters exhibiting arsenic concentrations well above the world health organization who guideline value for drinking water of 10 μg l 1 edition 2011 have been found in argentina chile mexico china and hungary and more recently in west bengal india bangladesh and vietnam mandal and suzuki 2002 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 as iii and as v are the predominant arsenic forms in natural waters with the former being more toxic than the latter pous et al 2015 as most arsenic sequestration technologies are not very effective in directly removing the dominant uncharged as iii species pre oxidation of as iii to as v is commonly used to improve the arsenic removal efficiency bissen and frimmel 2003 leupin and hug 2005 cdi is capable of serving as an alternative technique for arsenic removal with the potential for utilization of the combined effects of electro oxidation and electrosorption fan et al 2016 garrido et al 2009 lee et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 as reported by fan et al 2016 as iii can be anodically oxidized to as v followed by electrosorption of the in situ formed as v onto the surface of the anode following charging at 1 2 v for 120 min the arsenic concentrations decreased from 50 100 and 200 mg l 1 to 2 3 9 6 and 42 3 mg l 1 respectively with arsenic present in the treated water predominantly as as v it should be noted that in practical groundwater cases arsenic coexists with other inorganic anions and associated cations with the concentrations of these inorganic anions e g cl no3 and so4 2 several magnitudes higher than arsenic as such the impact of the presence of other inorganic salts on removal of arsenic by cdi from solution requires careful attention in addition to removal of salt and minor components from groundwaters consideration has also been given to treatment of municipal wastewater effluents these wastewaters typically contain a range of organic compounds with the chemical oxygen demand cod of these effluents ranging from 20 to 100 mg l 1 as well as inorganic salts at concentrations ranging from 100 to 1000 mg l 1 kim et al 2008 li et al 2011 recently duan et al 2015b employed cdi for the simultaneous removal of phenol and nacl from a synthetic wastewater the anodic oxidation of phenol was achieved in the cdi system through i the direct oxidation of phenol at the anode generating benzoquinone and catechol by hydroxylation and or ii the indirect mineralization by active chlorine which was generated through the anodic oxidation of cl eq 4 with the formation of chlorophenols as intermediate in this pathway these aromatic intermediates were then oxidized to carboxylic acids and ultimately to co2 in a similar manner liu et al 2016 confirmed that cdi was capable of breaking down naturally occurring humic substances via anodic electrochemical oxidation with subsequent electrosorption of oxidized humic substances and their derivatives this indicated that cdi technology may be of use in the pre treatment of drinking waters as it can decrease the extent of formation of disinfection by products by partial removal of natural organic matter precursors while several attempts have been made to remove heavy metals including cu ii huang et al 2014 cd ii huang et al 2016 pb ii yang et al 2014 and fe iii li et al 2010 from waters by cdi little mechanistic insight has been obtained with both non faradic electrosorption and cathodic reduction of cations expected to be of importance for the fixation of these heavy metals huang et al 2016 investigated the electro enhanced removal of cu ii from water using a cdi cell equipped with activated carbon electrodes when a low charging voltage of 0 4 v was applied cu ii appeared to be removed from solution via non faradaic processes with no apparent deposition of elemental cu on the cathode surface during charging at 0 8 v particles of 1 2 μm in size appeared on the electrode surface on further increase in charging voltage to 1 2 v large numbers of particles were generated and covered a significant portion of the electrode surface xps analysis revealed that these particles were a combination of metallic copper i e cu 0 and cuprous oxide i e cu2o confirming the occurrence of cathodic reduction of cu ii at relatively higher charging voltages 6 perspectives and outlook faradaic processes in cdi systems have attracted increasing interest in recent years with investigation of both oxidation and reduction reactions resulting from application of charging potential leading to a firmer understanding of both the benefits and pitfalls of faradaic effects here we provide a comprehensive review of faradaic reactions in cdi systems with particular attention given to cathodic oxygen reduction and anodic carbon oxidation one approach to gaining a perspective on the occurrence and impacts of cdi faradaic reactions is to utilize a flowchart as described in fig 9 with these reactions playing an important role in i mitigation or elimination of the undesired faradaic reactions in the system ii employment of particular reactions which can be useful for improving desalination performance or achieving cdi multifunctionality e g disinfection and micropollutant sequestration and iii enhancement of faradaic reaction mediated desalination based on pseudocapacitive effects charge efficiency in achieving particular water quality and water recovery rate targets is used as the key performance parameter in this analysis carbon electrode oxidation caused by faradaic reactions is one of the most critical issues in cdi long term operation with these reactions resulting in carbon electrode deterioration and desalination performance decline use of membrane cdi mcdi appears to be effective in eliminating cathodic oxygen reduction with an associated positive shift in electrode potential to the anode thereby reducing the rate and extent of carbon anode oxidation with resultant extension of electrode lifetime combining ion exchange polymers with carbon electrodes may also contribute to mitigation of carbon oxidation as well as alleviating resistance and ion exchange membrane cost issues that are associated with mcdi more detailed studies on this issue are required in order to refine the replacement of ion exchange membranes by carbon polymer composite electrodes there are very few examples showing that anodic chloride oxidation occurs in cdi systems with resultant production of active chlorine species that could be applied to in situ disinfection or indirect oxidant of organic pollutants this reaction is likely to occur in hybrid cdi systems equipped with both transition metal containing materials and carbon materials as electrodes where unequal potential distribution and or metal catalytic properties favor the oxidation of chloride at the anode one major concern is that the chloride oxidation process is likely to yield chlorinated byproducts potentially increasing the health hazards associated with drinking water purification using cdi in such systems monitoring the possible formation of chlorine by products such as chlorate perchlorate or organochlorine as well as oxidative products of the anion exchange membrane is recommended especially when using higher voltages for drinking water desalination cathodic oxygen reduction considering that the cathode potential is always expected to be lower than the redox potential of the oxygen reduction reaction will inevitably occur in cdi systems our recent findings have revealed that the dissolved oxygen concentration can serve as a simple and convenient indicator of the rate and extent of oxygen reduction a mechanically based kinetic model of the faradaic reactions occurring at the cathode has been developed and found to satisfactorily describe the variation of do consumed and h2o2 generated during cdi operation he et al 2016 the presence of h2o2 could provide the means of inducing disinfection or micropollutant degradation in the cdi system provided that h2o2 can be effectively activated to more powerful oxidants by for example uv photolysis or o3 addition ph fluctuation is another serious issue in cdi systems as it affects the treated water quality and potentially results in scaling issues at the cathode if large amounts of alkaline earth metal ions such as ca2 or mg2 are present although we have demonstrated that faradaic reactions contribute greatly to the ph fluctuations in cdi system with carbon electrodes non faradaic processes such as the differing transport and adsorption desorption rates of protons and hydroxyl ions may also play non negligible roles the contribution of faradaic and non faradaic processes to ph fluctuations should be elucidated as this will assist in developing feasible strategies to mitigate any side effects additionally in situ measurement e g by use of ph micro electrodes or modelling of the ph variation at near the electrode interface is required as this will enable further exploration of the mechanisms contributing to ph fluctuations to date most attention has focused on non faradaic processes i e capacitive ion storage in edls in cdi with limited attention given to faradaic processes despite the importance of these processes to both treated water quality and long term stability and performance of this technology as such some urgency exists with regard to improving our mechanistic understanding of faradaic reactions with the goal of effectively mitigating the negative effects of these processes whilst taking advantage of their positive effects it is encouraging to see that faradaic capacitive electrodes can contribute significantly to the enhancement of desalination performance through intercalation effects unlike the traditional carbon electrodes that take advantage of the pure edls for ion removal faradaic capacitive electrodes can remove ion species through faradaic reactions with high efficiency and low energy consumption most recently ultra high salt removal capacity of more than 100 mg g 1 was achieved when using these intercalation electrodes almost seven times higher than that of traditional static capacitive carbon electrodes however the stability of such electrodes particularly associated with the electrochemical leakage of metal ions is currently a major concern and an issue to which more attention should be paid furthermore it is necessary to develop cost effective stable and novel intercalation cathodes and anodes to meet the requirement of capturing multiple cations and anions from real saline waters 7 conclusions in conclusion a comprehensive overview of the types and mechanisms of faradaic reactions i e carbon electrode oxidation chloride oxidation dissolved oxygen reduction and faradaic ion storage reactions that may occur in cdi systems has been presented here the negative influences of these reactions on cdi lifetime and desalination performance has been described a number of strategies such as optimization of cell configuration modification of operational mode and fabrication of novel cdi electrodes have been proposed to reduce or even eliminate faradaic side effects it is also recognized that faradaic reactions have a variety of exciting and promising applications including the incorporation of intercalation electrodes for highly saline water desalination or value added ion separation recovery through reversible faradaic reactions and employment of particular reactions enabling cdi to fulfil

19864,capacitive deionization cdi is considered to be one of the most promising technologies for the desalination of brackish water with low to medium salinity in practical applications faradaic redox reactions occurring in cdi may have both negative and positive effects on cdi performance in this review we present an overview of the types and mechanisms of faradaic reactions in cdi systems

huang et al 2017 liu et al 2015 cell configurations gao et al 2015b jeon et al 2013 lee et al 2006 2014 suss et al 2012 operational modes garcia quismondo et al 2016 zhao et al 2012 and process modelling dykstra et al 2016 porada et al 2013a tang et al 2016 have generated renewed interest in cdi technology from both water treatment and energy recovery perspectives as evidence of this renewed interest the number of papers published in the cdi field has increased enormously since 2000 fig 1 in a typical cdi cell fig 2 when applying a voltage difference across the two electrodes cations are attracted to the cathode and anions to the anode resulting in the salt ions being removed from solution following ion electrosorption the electrodes can be regenerated by short circulating the anode and cathode or executing polarity reversal with the trapped ions released back into the brine stream huang et al 2013 suss et al 2015 zhao et al 2013 there are two main mechanisms for ion storage during cdi desalination processes i e non faradaic ion storage and faradaic ion storage biesheuvel et al 2017 su and hatton 2017 with non faradaic capacitive ion storage the most important electrochemical process for salt removal this process is based on the formation of an electrical double layer edl at the carbon electrode where upon applying a potential difference ions are captured electrostatically and stored capacitively in the diffuse layer formed inside the carbon electrode intraparticle pores porada et al 2013b in order to enhance the non faradaic capacitive ion storage considerable efforts have been invested in fabricating electrode materials with high adsorption capacity and sustainable use these properties are usually associated with materials that possess high surface area appropriate pore distribution excellent electrical conductivity and good chemical stability liu et al 2015 faradaic processes although assumed by early investigators to facilitate ion removal from water johnson et al 1970 porada et al 2013b have not been extensively examined until recently whilst non faradaic processes are the most common phenomenon in cdi it is now recognized that faradaic reactions fig 3 may have both negative and positive effects on cdi performance various types of faradaic reactions exist in cdi systems some of which need to be considered seriously as they may lead to i a decrease in electrode performance energy efficiency and or electrode lifespan and or ii the formation of chemical by products and or ph fluctuations of the product water cohen et al 2013 2015 he et al 2016 lee et al 2014 while others can be employed to improve desalination performance through pseudocapacitive intercalation effects and formation of charged species in this study three types of faradaic reactions are categorized as described below type i are oxidation reactions that occur at the anode including carbon electrode oxidation chloride oxidation water oxidation and other particular contaminant oxidation reactions such as oxidation of inorganic ions and organic matters of these reactions the carbon oxidation reactions have attracted the most attention given the deleterious effects that may accrue such as pore structure impairment and mass loss with subsequent decrease in carbon electrode longevity and deterioration of cdi performance cohen et al 2013 wouters et al 2013 type ii are reduction reactions that take place at the cathode with oxygen reduction being the most common while it has been reported that the oxygen reduction reaction leads to the asymmetric distribution of potential of the anode and cathode with subsequent acceleration of the anodic carbon oxidation reactions he et al 2016 the in situ generation of by products such as h2o2 as a result of oxygen reduction might be constructively used for water disinfection possibly via combination with uv irradiation and or degradation of organic contaminants provided that h2o2 can be effectively activated to produce more powerful oxidants in addition cathodic reduction reactions may contribute to the removal of heavy metals from water as a result of the possible deposition of the metals at the electrode type iii are faradaic ion storage processes in which pseudocapacitive intercalation effects are used to store ions through reversible redox reactions instead of electrostatic storage in the edls at the electrode electrolyte interfaces chen et al 2017a lee et al 2014 smith 2017 su and hatton 2017 due to the superior ion electrosorption capacity of intercalation electrodes compared to traditional carbon electrodes faradaic ion storage processes have received considerable attention recently lee et al 2014 some of the most commonly investigated intercalation electrode materials are sodium transition metal oxides natmo tm mn ti fe ni co etc see fig 3b sodium iron pyrophosphate prussian blue analogues for the capture of cations and conductive polymers polypyrrole or polyaniline see fig 3c ag acl biocl for the bonding of anions han et al 2015 palomares et al 2012 porada et al 2017 su et al 2016 in the current review we provide a comprehensive description of the possible faradaic reactions that could occur in cdi desalination processes we also provide insight into both the positive and negative effects of these reactions guidelines and strategies that may be used to reduce or eliminate the negative side effects of faradaic reactions are presented and approaches to best utilizing faradaic reactions in a positive manner are described 2 types of faradaic reactions as introduced above three major types of faradaic reactions are addressed in this review article namely i anodic reactions associated with oxidation of the carbon electrode chloride and water iii cathodic reactions particularly those involving oxygen reduction and iii faradaic ion storage occurring on particular redox active electrodes 2 1 anodic oxidation reactions 2 1 1 carbon oxidation of all the anodic faradaic reactions in cdi systems those involving carbon electrode oxidation are of most importance given their potential for negative impact on the performance and longevity of the system the standard electrode potential for carbon oxidation is 0 21 v vs she maass et al 2008 oh et al 2008 which is likely to be within the cdi potential window when the cdi cell is operated at 1 2 v or higher as such during the cdi desalination process the carbon anode might not only electrochemically store anions but may also sacrificially take part in the oxidation process with the carbon electrode initially incorporating oxygen containing groups and potentially eventually being converted at least in part into co2 which leads to carbon mass loss and deterioration in cdi performance these oxidation processes may be a consequence of both direct oxidation when the anode is polarized according to eqs 1 3 ayranci and conway 2001 bayram and ayranci 2011 lee et al 2010 maass et al 2008 oh et al 2008 and indirect oxidation as a result of the anodic generation of oxidants such as chlorine and hydroxyl radicals 1 c h 2 o c o 2 h 2 e 2 c h 2 o c oh h e 3 c 2 h 2 o co 2 4 h 4 e e 0 0 21 v she strategies to evaluate the oxidation of the cdi electrodes are based on monitoring the changes in the functional groups of electrodes using methods such as x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps scanning electron microscopy sem with energy dispersive x ray edx mapping fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir acid base titration and cyclic voltammetry bouhadana et al 2011b chen et al 2013 cohen et al 2013 2015 the changes in the xps oxygen o 1s and carbon c 1s response to the charging and discharging cycling of the carbon anode and cathode were also demonstrated cohen et al 2013 it was found that the intensity of the o 1s spectrum increased while the c 1s intensity decreased in the carbon anode after long term operation indicating that the anode acquired more oxygen containing groups during the desalination process cohen et al 2013 in a similar work utilizing xps analysis it was found that various new oxygen containing species were formed on the carbon electrode surface after prolonged operation although the types of these oxygen species were not fully identified bouhadana et al 2011b cohen et al 2015 also reported that the oxygen composition in the anode increased from 3 77 to 8 52 wt following long term cdi operation 20 days based on sem edx results by performing cyclic voltammetry measurements haro et al 2011 revealed that the intensity of the cathodic anodic peaks assigned to quinone hydroquinone groups on the carbon anode increased following several cycles of cdi operation confirming the gradual oxidation of the carbon to oxygen containing groups in addition thermal analysis of these anodes suggest that the appearance of high temperature desorption bands generally identified as co evolving groups could be attributed to the incorporation of carbonyl type groups on the carbon electrodes these observations agree with the acid base titration results reported by chen et al 2013 who found that the amount of cooh groups present in a carbon electrode increased from 0 027 to 0 391 mmol g 1 after use increase in resistivity and decrease in surface area and pore volume during the prolonged charging discharging cycles have also been associated with the anodic oxidation of carbon electrodes cohen et al 2015 duan et al 2015a gao et al 2014 haro et al 2011 omosebi et al 2014 recent results also demonstrated that oxidation of the carbon anode induced changes in pore structure with a decrease in the volume of the micropores bayram and ayranci 2011 chen et al 2013 the parameter recognized to contribute most strongly to ion electrosorption capacity porada et al 2013a as such the prolonged anodic oxidation of carbon electrodes can be expected to lead to the deterioration of electrode structural properties with resultant desalination performance decline gao et al 2014 omosebi et al 2014 therefore approaches to the reduction and or the elimination of this faradaic side reaction are critically required 2 1 2 chloride and water oxidation anodic oxidation of cl and water may occur during the cdi electrochemical treatment of brackish waters provided anodic potentials are sufficiently positive to drive these redox reactions the mechanisms involving the anodic oxidation of cl are as follows i the direct oxidation of cl at the anode yields free chlorine i e cl2 eq 4 ii cl2 is rapidly hydrolyzed and disproportionates to form hypochlorous acid hclo eq 5 and iii hclo and its deprotonated form clo eq 6 can be further oxidized to chlorate clo3 anodically eq 7 additionally the direct oxidation of cl to clo3 may occur at the anode eq 8 comninellis and nerini 1995 jung et al 2010 martínez huitle and brillas 2009 martinez huitle et al 2015 szpyrkowicz et al 1994 4 2 cl cl 2 2 e e 0 1 36 v she 5 cl 2 h 2 o hclo h cl 6 hclo h clo 7 6 hclo 3 h 2 o 2 clo 3 4 cl 12 cl 3 2 o 2 6 e e 0 0 46 v she 8 cl 3 h 2 o clo 3 6 h 6 e e 0 1 45 v she the formation of clo3 during cdi operation has been confirmed by lado et al 2013 and wouters et al 2013 who showed that a minimal amount of clo3 accumulated during the first 5 min whilst rapid removal of cl occurred over this same time period with cl concentration approaching steady state following 10 min of charging the production rate of clo3 increased significantly it was also found that the more cl that was removed from solution the more extensive was the generation of clo3 in the cdi system wouters et al 2013 this result suggests that cl associated with the anode surface rather than free cl in solution was the main contributor to the generation of clo3 it should be noted that while a relatively low cathode potential of 1 74 v vs she was reported in the above work neither the anode potential nor charging voltage were provided as such quantification of clo3 generated under more typical cdi operating conditions with well defined anode potential is required to properly interpret these results as noted earlier the anodic oxidation of water eqs 9 and 10 may also occur barrera díaz et al 2014 martinez huitle et al 2015 moreira et al 2017 sires et al 2014 9 2 h 2 o o 2 4 h 4 e e 0 1 23 v she 10 h2o ho h e e 0 2 80 v she although the oxygen evolution reaction eq 9 exhibits a relatively lower standard redox potential than that for the chloride oxidation reaction eq 4 the oxidation of cl is likely to occur preferentially in the cdi system in view of its lower overpotential and the abundance of cl in the vicinity of the anode during the electrosorption process abdel aal et al 1993 balaji et al 2009 bennett 1980 hlushkou et al 2016 knust et al 2013 to limit the extent of current leakage due to the occurrence of water electrolysis the cdi process is typically operated at charging voltages below the limit of 1 23 v porada et al 2013b it is critical however that the anode potential be monitored over the duration of cdi operation since it is likely that i an asymmetric distribution of potentials of the electrodes will occur with a positive shift in potential of the anode and ii significant ph fluctuations in the vicinity of the anode will occur an anodic potential sufficient to induce oxidation of cl to cl2 may be used if there is a specific desire to generate cl2 for either disinfection or ammonia oxidation purposes though there will obviously be a risk of current leakage due to water oxidation 2 2 cathodic reduction reactions 2 2 1 dissolved oxygen reduction dissolved oxygen do is ubiquitous in feed waters to cdi units as a result faradaic oxygen reduction reactions occur at the cathode with the possible oxygen reduction reactions shown in eqs 12 14 dissolved oxygen can be reduced either via two electron transfer to hydrogen peroxide h2o2 eq 12 with e 0 0 69 v she or four electron reduction to water via eq 14 with e 0 1 23 v she shapira et al 2016 in view of the evidence for the presence of h2o2 in cdi systems he et al 2016 the cathodic reduction of oxygen most likely occurs via the two electron transfer pathway according to eq 12 12 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 e 0 0 69 v she 13 h 2 o 2 2 h 2 e 2 h 2 o e 0 1 78 v she 14 o 2 4 h 4 e 2 h 2 o e 0 1 23 v she it has been reported that the cdi cathode potential is typically in the range 0 3 to 0 6 v vs she suggesting that cathodic oxygen reduction is inevitable recent batch mode cdi studies have revealed that decrease in do concentration is accompanied by formation of h2o2 he et al 2016 the reduction of do concentration follows pseudo first order kinetics i e 15 d o 2 d t k o 2 where k represents the pseudo first order rate constant for do decrease as reported by he et al 2016 the k values increased from 5 4 10 5 to 2 7 10 3 s 1 with increase in charging voltage from 0 5 to 1 5 v the steady state concentration of h2o2 varied significantly with the charging voltage with h2o2 concentration reaching as high as 60 μm when the charging voltage was 1 2 v as shown in fig 4 kim et al 2016b also reported the cathodic generation of h2o2 on operation of a cdi unit in single pass mode it was found that approximately 0 1 mg of h2o2 was produced over 50 operation cycles at a charging voltage of 1 2 v electrochemical analysis confirmed that cathodic oxygen reduction was thermodynamically favorable even at very low charging voltages e g 0 6 v 2 2 2 carbon reduction carbon electrodes not only undergo anodic oxidation but also experience cathodic reduction or hydrogenation eq 16 resulting in the introduction of additional ch groups to the carbon electrodes soffer and folman 1972 although several research groups have mentioned the possibility of occurrence of carbon reduction in their cdi systems chen et al 2013 lado et al 2014 there has been no conclusive evidence presented to date to confirm the occurrence of this reaction nor its standard potential 16 c h 2 o e c h oh the range of redox potentials over which the main faradaic reactions occur on the cdi anodes and cathodes and typical electrode working potentials as a function of cell voltage are shown in fig 5 holubowitch et al 2017 the potential map provides a very useful practical guide for optimization of cell voltage such that side faradaic reactions are minimized 2 3 faradaic ion storage faradaic ion storage processes involve the application of intercalation electrodes mainly transition metal containing material or conductive polymer for ion harvesting from saline waters the ion storage mechanisms involve the trapping of ions into the crystallographic sites of the intercalation materials via redox reactions with this process fundamentally different from the edl charging process occurring within conventional carbon electrodes due to the exemplary salt electro adsorption capacity and potential ion selectivity of these electrodes faradaic ion storage processes are attracting increasing attention interest in faradaic desalination has been inspired by sodium and lithium ion battery systems transition metal containing materials have been most commonly used for cathode construction while preparation with sodium manganese oxide na0 44mno2 na2mn5o10 lithium manganese oxide lixmn2o4 sodium iron pyrophosphate na2fep2o7 sodium nickel hexacyanoferrate nanihcf and sodium iron hexacyanoferrate nafehcf are of most interest in view of their capacity to trap alkali metal ions such as na and li but lower preference for ions such as mg2 and ca2 chen et al 2017a 2017b lee et al 2014 2017 missoni et al 2016 porada et al 2017 examples of reactions occurring at these cathodes are provided in eqs 20 and 21 20 na 0 44 x mno 2 x na x e na 0 44 mno 2 21 x li li 1 x mn 1 x m iii n o 2 iv x e limn iv mn o 4 iii there appears to be much less choice for the anode silver conductive polymers or biocl have been reported to be effective for the capture of chloride ions the most common anions in the saline water chen et al 2017a 2017b missoni et al 2016 examples of reactions taking place at the anodes are shown in eqs 22 24 22 ag cl agcl e 23 x cl x pp 0 x pp cl x e 24 bi bi 2 o 3 3 cl 3 biocl 3 e detailed discussion of the applications and desalination performances of faradaic electrodes is presented in section 5 1 3 negative effects of faradaic reactions as mentioned earlier the aging of carbon electrodes due particularly to anodic oxidation of electrode materials over long term cdi operation results in numerous side effects such as desalination performance decline water quality fluctuations and undesirable energy consumption 3 1 desalination performance decline cdi cells are usually depending on the design initially symmetrical with the potentials of the anodes and cathodes identical assuming they possess the same surface area and pore distribution bouhadana et al 2011a cohen et al 2015 cohen et al 2011 after a number of cycles of charging and discharging operation the distribution of potential between the anodes and cathodes ceases to be symmetrical due to the occurrence of faradaic side reactions e g the reduction of oxygen that inevitably occurs at the cathode with a positive shift in potential of the anodes consequently the anode potential may exceed its potential limit of stability leading to the occurrence of anodic carbon electrode oxidation in turn changes in the structure of the electrodes due to anodic oxidation may further drive the cdi cell away from symmetric behavior with the occurrence of cl and water oxidation see section 2 for further details finally resulting in decline in the charge efficiency and the desalination performance there have been several studies showing the decline in desalination capacity and charge efficiency during prolonged cdi operation bouhadana et al 2011a cohen et al 2013 gao et al 2015b lu et al 2017 gao et al 2015b conducted a detailed investigation with cdi cells equipped with 16 pairs of pristine carbon xerogel electrodes at charging discharging voltages of 1 2 0 and 0 8 0 v as shown in fig 6 a and b both the electrosorption capacity and charge efficiency declined significantly with an increase in the cycle number during the prolonged cycling tests a more rapid decline in the desalination performance was observed on increase in the charging voltage from 0 8 to 1 2 v similarly lu et al 2017 observed severe cdi performance degradation with the salt electrosorption capacity declining from 7 3 to 0 5 mg g 1 after 70 cycles in symmetric 1 2 0 v operation another recent study also reported that the charge efficiency dropped sharply from 92 to 69 5 and was accompanied by a dramatic increase in cell voltage from 0 6 to 4 8 v due to the occurrence of inevitable faradaic reactions despite these changes the rate of ion adsorption increased significantly by around 7 times liang et al 2017 an indicator of cdi performance decline after prolonged charge discharge cycles relates to the occurrence of a so called inversion effect which was reflected by the occurrence of ion desorption i e a rise in effluent conductivity during charging in turn ions are adsorbed and trapped in the electrodes i e effluent conductivity decreases on cell discharge bouhadana et al 2011a 3 2 water quality fluctuations as mentioned above the occurrence of faradaic reactions at the cdi electrodes may lead to ph fluctuations and the formation of chemical byproducts leading to severe fluctuations in the effluent water quality he et al 2016 reported that the effluent ph varied significantly with different charging voltages in a batch mode cdi cell upon applying a charging voltage of 0 9 v the ph rapidly climbed to 10 and then reached steady state while the effluent ph increased slightly and then decreased rapidly at charging voltages higher than 1 2 v which was in agreement with other studies lado et al 2014 lee et al 2010 cohen et al 2013 also reported that over long term cdi operation 13 days the ph shifted to more acidic conditions with ph fluctuations particularly severe during charging at 0 9 v while the ph fluctuations were insignificant and within the ph range of 6 7 when the cdi cell was charged at a lower voltage of 0 7 v interestingly the ph in the vicinity of the electrodes was significantly different to that in the bulk solution a highly inhomogenous ph environment appeared during the water desalination processes with the near anode and near cathode ph reaching 2 4 and 10 3 under a typical operation voltage of 1 2 v respectively holubowitch et al 2017 litmus paper was used in an earlier study to roughly measure the near electrode ph values and revealed that the ph close to the anode can decrease to as low as 2 3 while the ph at cathode can climb higher than 10 choi 2014 according to eqs 12 and 14 the oxygen reduction reactions at the cathode consume h with these reactions the dominant faradaic processes occurring when the voltage is relatively low e g 1 0 v resulting in ph increase lee et al 2010 with an increase in the charging voltage carbon electrode oxidation reactions start to occur eq 3 with the release of h into solution as the charging voltage further increases cl and water oxidation could take place at the anode eqs 4 8 most of these oxidation reactions are capable of generating h resulting in a decrease in the ph of the treated stream other interpretations of observed ph variations on operation of cdi systems could be attributed to the difference in ion mobility of h oh and other ions and or the non faradaic preferable electrosorption of these ions andres and yoshihara 2016 han et al 2013 porada et al 2013b interestingly dykstra et al 2017 presented a model enabling the prediction of ph changes in the mcdi cell they found that although the different mobilities of various ions contributed to the ph fluctuation of the effluent faradaic reactions played a more important role in relation to ph changes during cdi operation bouhadana et al 2011b reported that the ph fluctuation was dramatically reduced when replacing dissolved air with nitrogen by bubbling nitrogen gas into the solution suggesting that the ph fluctuation depends strongly on faradaic reactions involving oxygen at the electrodes while it has been reported that change of ph exerted an insignificant influence on salt removal during cdi operation porada et al 2012a significant effluent ph fluctuations remain problematic for example when cations such as ca2 and mg2 are present in the feed water scale formation on the surface of the cathodes is likely to be a problem particularly at higher phs where carbonate minerals containing these cations readily form choi and kang 2016 it is also worthwhile mentioning that the stability of some of the redox active electrodes such as those made from transition metal oxide carbon composites is likely to depend strongly on ph a rapid decrease of ph in the vicinity of the anodes could lead to the undesirable leakage of metal ions from the metal oxide composites potentially posing significant health risks to consumers in addition to ph fluctuations faradaic reactions may also generate undesired byproducts during charging and discharging cycles one example is the production of clo3 which as described earlier could be generated upon the oxidation of cl at the anode wouters et al 2013 the presence of high concentrations of clo3 in effluents represents serious health risks for both humans and animals srinivasan and sorial 2009 with deleterious effects including oxidative damage to erythrocytes and mutagenic activities in mammalian cells jung et al 2010 richardson et al 2007 due to these toxic effects the who has proposed a threshold limit for clo3 in drinking waters of 0 7 mg l 1 edition 2011 as such effective strategies must be implemented to prevent the generation of clo3 and its derivative by products if cdi is applied to drinking water purification 3 3 energy loss faradaic reactions also referred to as parasitic electrochemical charge transfer leakage currents and ohmic losses are the main reasons that the energy efficiency declines possibly by 20 30 over months of operation farmer et al 1996 recent studies of the energy loss mechanisms in cdi units under constant current cc operation reveal that resistive and parasitic losses primarily due to leakage currents associated with faradaic reactions at the electrodes are the two major sources of energy loss hemmatifar et al 2016 results of these studies indicate that resistive energy loss was dominant under high current conditions as it increases approximately linearly with current for fixed charge transfer on the other hand parasitic loss dominated in low current cases as the electrode is held at higher voltages for a longer period of time compared to operation in cc mode the energy loss in constant voltage cv mode is more significant mainly due to the higher resistive dissipation as well as the longer charging time spent at higher oxidizing potentials qu et al 2016 4 strategies to reduce eliminate faradaic side effects as described previously faradaic reactions may cause a range of negative side effects over prolonged cdi operation including desalination performance decline water quality fluctuations and undesirable energy consumption a variety of strategies may be envisaged to reduce eliminate these faradaic side effects including optimization of the cdi configuration modification of cdi operation mode and fabrication of novel cdi electrodes 4 1 alternative cdi configurations 4 1 1 membrane capacitive deionization membrane capacitive deionization mcdi is a significant improvement over conventional cdi and involves the incorporation of ion exchange membranes iems in front of the cdi electrodes thereby enabling more selective ion adsorption and desorption li et al 2008 incorporation of iems in cdi is also recognized to be an effective method to alleviate particular faradaic reactions including the cathodic reduction of oxygen and anodic oxidation of carbon omosebi et al 2014 tang et al 2017 compared the faradaic reactions occurring in cdi and mcdi cells equipped with carbon cloth electrodes through investigation of h2o2 production and do decay during charging h2o2 was generated with a steady state concentration of up to 60 μm in the cdi cell due to do reduction at the cathode eq 12 while less than 2 μm h2o2 was observed in the mcdi cell this was consistent with the observation that do decreased rapidly to 1 mg l 1 in the cdi cell while insignificant decay of do was observed in the mcdi cell as reported previously the oxygen diffusivity in neosepta and nafion membranes is two orders of magnitude smaller than that in water ogumi et al 1984 consequently iems incorporated in cdi units act as efficient barriers to transport of do to the cathode thereby inhibiting oxygen reduction reactions at the cathode in the mcdi cell the elimination of cathodic oxygen reduction could contribute to the alleviation of the positive shift of potential distribution to the anode over long term cdi operation bouhadana et al 2011b cohen et al 2013 more interestingly some researchers presented the effects of faradaic reactions on the long term performance of cdi and mcdi units equipped with carbon xerogel electrodes omosebi et al 2014 unlike cdi which was found to experience severe desalination performance decline in a short period of time mcdi exhibited stable performance over the 50 h of operation post testing evaluation of the used cdi anode showed a positive shift of e pzc by 0 5 v after 50 h operation while the voltage increase of the anode e pzc was only 0 2 v in the mcdi cell these results clearly demonstrate that the carbon oxidation reactions were suppressed by the incorporation of iems into the cdi unit more details in section 3 1 4 1 2 inverted capacitive deionization gao et al 2015b proposed a new cdi configuration termed inverted capacitive deionization i cdi with the aim to diminish side effects of faradaic reactions and achieve stable and efficient desalination performance the i cdi system involves the use of an anode with net negative surface charge and a cathode with net positive surface charge interestingly salt removal in this novel i cdi system was achieved in a manner completely opposite to traditional cdi systems with cell charging leading to ion desorption from the edls of the electrodes while cell discharging by short circuiting the anode and cathode led to ion adsorption fig 6a and b most importantly desalination performance was shown to be maintained for over 600 h an improvement in lifetime of the system by 530 compared to that of a conventional cdi system operated under similar conditions in a more recent work gao et al 2015a developed an amine treated anode with nh3 groups providing positive surface charge and acid treated carbon cathode with coo groups providing negative surface charge and achieved a desalination capacity of 5 3 mg g 1 at charging discharging voltages of 1 1 0 v with this performance representing a significant improvement with regard to both salt removal capacity and working voltage window compared to the first generation of i cdi systems wu et al 2016 further fabricated an i cdi system equipped with an activated carbon cathode modified by poly 4 vinylpyridine and a carbon anode treated with nitric acid and achieved a remarkably high salt removal capacity of 20 6 mg g 1 in i cdi systems the oxidation of the anode is not regarded as an adverse effect as is the case in conventional cdi systems indeed oxygen containing functional groups formed during the carbon oxidation process increase the net negative surface charge thereby further expanding the available internal working voltage window for salt separation performance fig 7 c as a consequence the formation of oxide thin layers at the anode could contribute to a significant improvement in cdi desalination stability in long term operation paving a new way for high performance cdi 4 1 3 flow electrode capacitive deionization flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi is an innovative mcdi method using suspended carbon slurry that flow in the flow channels carved on the current collectors fcdi exhibits a number of distinctive benefits for water desalination i e excellent ion adsorption capacity continuous desalination behavior and potentially energy and resource recovery if designed and operated appropriately it has been reported recently that the anode ph could decrease to 1 5 while cathode ph increased to 12 5 when the fcdi was operated in a separated flow electrode mode anode and cathode slurry flowing separately nativ et al 2017 however when using the combined flow electrode the anode and cathode flow electrodes mixing outside the fcdi cell the faradaic reaction could be partly supressed with the combined flow electrode ph stabilized at around 7 and the energy consumption much lower compared to the separated flow electrode cdi 4 1 4 flow by and flow through capacitive deionization flow by and flow through cdi are two types of common cdi configurations guyes et al 2017 suss et al 2012 a recent comparison of the long term stability of these two configurations during desalination indicated that use of a flow by configuration could enhance the cdi cell stability by up to 360 compared to the flow through configuration with a lifetime of 18 days compared to 5 days cohen et al 2015 as such flow by cdi is considered to be a better configuration than flow through cdi mainly due to the presence of a hydrodynamic diffuse boundary layer which prevents rapid transport of dissolved oxygen to the surface of the cathode the limitation of oxygen reduction on the cathode results in the reduction of an asymmetric distribution of potentials in flow by cells 4 2 operational approaches 4 2 1 optimization of the voltage window as reported by lu et al 2017 cdi underwent significant performance decline even when operated at a voltage as low as 1 2 v to mitigate the performance decline they tested a number of different charging and discharging voltages and finally obtained the optimal operation voltage window to be charging at 0 8 v and discharging at 0 4 v the cdi system exhibited a slightly lower desalination capacity 6 3 mg g 1 under this voltage window compared to that of the 1 2 0 v experiment 7 3 mg g 1 nevertheless it is an important finding that carbon oxidation was inhibited in this optimal voltage window with negligible performance degradation observed even after more than 70 operation cycles 4 2 2 constant current operation to reduce faradaic reactions one straightforward and effective method is to apply a lower charging voltage to the cdi cells indeed there always exists a conflict between mitigation of anodic oxidation of carbon electrodes and enhancement of desalination performance based on the gouy chapman stern model higher charging voltage applied to the cdi cell results in improvement of ion electrosorption capacity while the higher voltage could lead to increased anodic oxidation of the carbon electrodes over prolonged cdi operation zhao et al 2009 as such cc mode is more favorable than cv mode since electrodes are exposed to higher voltages for less time resulting in lower resistive and parasitic losses during cc compared to cv operation qu et al 2016 4 2 3 periodic electrode polarity reversal it has been found that the decline in cdi electrosorption capacity on aging of the carbon electrodes can be recovered to a large extent by periodically reversing the cell polarity cohen et al 2015 farmer et al 1996 cohen et al 2015 have examined this possibility and found that when the cdi unit was operated periodically according to the following four steps i 0 9 v ii 0 v iii 0 9 v iv 0 v with each step lasting for 30 min the desalination performance showed no obvious decline even after running for 34 days while control experiments with the charging discharging cycle of 0 9 v 0 v achieved only 5 days of stable operation the ph fluctuations were only in the range of 5 8 7 indicating reasonable stability of the cell unlike the regular behavior of the conventional cdi with one electrode serving as the anode and the other as the cathode during charging in periodic polarity reversing mode each electrode periodically serves as anode or cathode this operation provides an identical working condition for both electrodes in long term operation thereby avoiding the asymmetric shifting of the e pzc between two electrodes and thus suppressing the faradaic reactions especially reducing the rate and extent of the oxidation of the electrodes cohen et al 2015 similarly gao et al 2017 reported desalination performance of the cdi stack equipped with carbon xerogel electrodes by alternating polarization of 1 2 0 v long term operation suggested that this operational mode could eliminate the formation of inversion peaks thereby effectively extending the cycling stability for salt ion removal the surface charge of both carbon electrodes gradually shifted from positively charged to negatively charged due to the inevitable and irreversible faradaic reactions as each electrode alternately served as cdi anode during this alternating polarization process these studies also demonstrated for the first time that the highest salt adsorption capacity was attained after 200 h of operation when the positively and negatively charged surface sites on the electrodes became nearly equal 4 2 4 deoxygenation cell as demonstrated previously the presence of dissolved oxygen results in undesirable oxygen reduction reactions at the cathode even under a low operating voltage use of a low cost deoxygenation cell to remove dissolved oxygen before the water enters the cdi cell results in inhibition of the oxygen reduction reaction and suppresses its competition with the cation capacitive adsorption thereby resulting in an enhanced salt adsorption capacity and reduced energy consumption holubowitch et al 2017 4 3 novel cdi electrode fabrication recent studies have demonstrated that the impregnation of certain types of polymers could effectively suppress the faradaic effects choi and choi 2010 fabricated carbon electrodes by mixing the activated carbon powder with polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf binder and showed that the faradaic current decreased significantly with increase in the pvdf content of the carbon electrodes further investigations suggested that the polymer binder reduced the redox activity of the functional groups i e carbonyl or quinone type oxygen functional groups on the carbon surface hsieh and teng 2002 in addition a novel polymer impregnated carbon anode involving coating a mixture of the type i strong base anion resin n methyl 2pyrrolidone nmp and pvdf onto carbon cloth was fabricated by gao et al 2016 the experimental results showed that stable desalination performance and higher charge efficiency with much less significant effluent ph fluctuations were obtained using this novel anode meanwhile the e pzc of the pristine anode shifted positively by 0 26 v whereas the polymer coated anode showed minimal obvious e pzc shift after prolonged operation demonstrating that the coverage of anion exchange polymer layers could effectively mitigate the anodic oxidation of carbon electrodes srimuk et al 2016 chemically modified activated carbon ac electrodes with titania which could provide additional catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reactions at the cathode and preventing oxidization of the carbon electrode the study revealed that titania coated ac electrodes exhibited higher desalination capacity and better long time stability than pure ac electrodes in oxygen saturated nacl solution after 15 operating cycles the ac titania hybrid electrode presented a comparable high salt removal capacity of 8 mg g 1 whereas cdi with the pure ac electrodes lost almost all the desalination capacity it was shown that pure ac electrodes exhibited the oxygen reduction reaction in a two electron transfer and produced h2o2 which was then used to attack the carbon electrodes resulting in a decline in desalination performance in contrast ac titania electrodes consumed the oxygen via a three electron transfer reaction that suppressed the formation of h2o2 preventing the carbon electrode from being oxidized and partially reducing the deterioration of the cdi desalination performance 5 positive applications of faradaic reactions although faradaic reactions are generally recognized to cause serious problems including electrode deterioration and associated desalination performance decline water quality fluctuations and undesirable energy loss some faradaic reactions may contribute to the enhancement of desalination performance and or may contribute to the achievement of cdi multifunctionality such as simultaneous desalination and disinfection micropollutant degradation these possibilities are discussed briefly below 5 1 desalination performance enhancement 5 1 1 faradaic ion storage over the past few years researchers have been focusing on optimization of traditional cdi systems equipped with static porous carbon electrodes and have achieved salt adsorption capacities approaching 15 mg g 1 for flow carbon electrode system a slightly higher salt adsorption capacity of 20 mg g 1 is expected due to the low intrinsic charge storage capacitance of porous carbon electrodes however a cdi device based on the mechanism of non faradaic capacitive adsorption ion storage in the edls of carbon micropores suffers from the limitation of improvement of salt adsorption capacity as mentioned in section 2 3 an alternative means of enhancing ion storage is to employ innovative pseudocapacitive electrodes which extract ions through reversible faradaic reactions that occur on intercalation of ionic species within the electrodes with advantages particularly in the desalination of highly concentrated saline water and in the selective harvesting of particular ions a comparison of desalination performance among electrodes based on edl and faradaic ion storage mechanisms is presented in table 1 following the pioneering attempts at using pure faradaic based cdi cells in which sodium manganese oxide na2mn5o10 was employed as the cathode for sodium capture while ag agcl served as the anode for chloride capture pasta et al 2012 a modified hybrid cdi cell was proposed by lee et al 2014 this hybrid cdi cell was composed of a faradaic type cathode sodium manganese oxide materials na4mn9o18 and a non faradaic type anode porous carbon materials and exhibited a desalination capacity of 31 2 mg g 1 twice as high as that for pure carbon capacitive electrodes in their subsequent work kim et al 2016a sodium iron pyrophosphate na2fep2o7 electrodes which served as the faradaic cathode were developed with this hybrid cdi system achieving a reasonably high electrosorption capacity 30 2 mg g 1 porada et al 2017 prepared a novel porous electrode which contained redox active nickel hexacyanoferrate nihcf nanoparticles and used them for electrochemical water desalination when applying a current density of 2 8 a m 2 a high electrosorption capacity 34 mg g 1 was achieved 1 5 times higher than that of the cdi with carbon electrodes 12 5 mg g 1 meanwhile the current efficiency reached 80 95 and energy costs of desalination were significantly reduced chen et al 2017a b reported a similar faradaic capacitive deionization cell based on na0 44mno2 cathode and ag agcl anode for chemical intercalation and deintercalation of sodium and chloride ions with this electrode system exhibiting a stable and reversible desalination capacity of 57 4 mg g 1 after 100 cycles of operation with an excellent charge efficiency of 97 9 95 6 during the charging discharging process more recently anther novel faradaic capacitive based desalination system was developed with sodium nickel hexacyanoferrate nanihcf and sodium iron hcf nafehcf as the electrodes lee et al 2017 one interesting aspect of this cell is that desalination took place not only during the charging step but also the discharging step achieving the continuous desalination brackish water with a high desalination capacity 59 9 mg g 1 and efficient energy consumption 5 10 w hh mol 1 following this work kim et al 2017 developed a similar cdi system using identical copper hexacyanoferrate cuhcf electrodes to bind sodium and chloride separated via the anion exchange membrane with this cell realizing a desalination capacity of nearly 100 mg g 1 most recently dual ion electrochemical desalination systems using na0 44mno2 as the sodium ion faradaic electrode and biocl as the chloride ion faradaic electrode have been explored an extremely high salt capture capacity of 68 5 mg g 1 and a charge efficiency of 97 7 were achieved chen et al 2017b with these results suggesting a promising future for highly saline water desalination while a variety of electrodes have been fabricated for the selective intercalation of cations only a few have been developed for the capture of anions missoni et al 2016 developed an alternative limn2o4 polypyrrole electrochemical cell to selectively capture lithium chloride from seawater or other natural brine solution chloride ions were successfully extracted by the polypyrrole coated carbon felt anode while the lithium ions were effectively harvested in the limn2o4 cathode upon applying a low potential difference of 0 6 1 1 v a competitive charge efficiency of 50 with energy consumption of 5 10 w hh mol 1 was achieved with excellent reproducibility over 200 cycles in addition to removal of salts cations and anions from aqueous solution faradaic ion storage has also been applied to the selective separation of charged organic matter from electrolyte solutions containing strong inorganic salts as well as dilute organic pollutants su et al 2016 developed a system comprised of carbon electrodes coated with redox active material pvf cnt which exhibited excellent selectivity towards organic anions carboxylates coo sulfonates so3 and phosphonates po3 2 with a separation factor of more than 140 and 3000 times compared to inorganic anions pf6 and clo4 in aqueous and organic solutions respectively in later studies a similar system with organometallic functionalized redox cathode and ferrocene modified redox anode was used in an asymmetric electrochemical capacitive cell and demonstrated a remarkable degree of selectivity for the retention of charged micro pollutants such as pesticides endocrine disruptors and pharmaceuticals with a current density of up to 96 their findings provide a promising and energy efficient pathway for the capture recovery of value added products and or the separation isolation of dilute but highly toxic organic pollutants from aqueous or organic systems su et al 2017 although faradaic ion storage is a promising area and one in which there is considerable interest several problems still remain to be solved i most intercalation electrodes are only efficient for capture of particular ions for example sodium manganese oxide nmo can selectively take up na while nihcf shows affinity for k while attractive for removal of particular ions this selectivity limits their application with regard to treatment of source waters containing multiple types of ions including na k ca2 and mg2 ii there is a lack of materials that can serve as the anion storage electrodes in aqueous media although ag agcl was found to be a highly efficient cl ion capture electrode its further application is likely to be limited by commercial constraints more studies should be focused on the development of cost effective efficient and stable intercalation electrodes for anions such as cl f no3 so4 2 from saline waters iii although researchers have claimed that these faradaic electrodes can be operated for hundreds of cycles without significant decrease in desalination performance undesired leakage of metal ions from the intercalation materials might occur during prolonged operation potentially causing risks when used for drinking water desalination bouchard et al 2011 dion et al 2016 5 1 2 electron mediators another innovative application of faradaic reactions in desalination enhancement involves the introduction of redox active electron shuttles such as quinones into fcdi systems where aqueous suspensions of activated carbon particles flow through a channel carved on the current collector ma et al 2016 the quinone species in the flow electrode acted as an electron mediator with redox transformation between the reduced hydroquinone h2q and oxidized benzoquinone q forms of the quinone occurring at the electrode surface and electrolyte interface fig 8 a the presence of the h2q q couple in the flowing carbon suspension significantly accelerated the charge transfer between the carbon particles and current collectors thereby enhancing both the salt electrosorption and desorption processes fig 8b on applying a charging voltage of 1 2 v the average salt removal rate increased by 131 on adding h2q at a concentration of 14 mm to a 1 wt activated carbon suspension with a similar positive effect observed during the discharging process this result represents a breakthrough in the development of fcdi with the application of faradaic reactions providing a highly efficient means for enhancing desalination performance 5 2 other faradaic applications 5 2 1 disinfection as described previously active species such as hclo ho and h2o2 can be generated through the occurrence of faradaic reactions in a cdi cell with these species potentially of use in water disinfection laxman et al 2015 evaluated the bacterial inactivation properties of a cdi cell with activated carbon cloth electrodes and observed an approximate 3 fold reduction in the number of viable bacterial colonies from 3 104 cfu ml 1 in the feed water following cdi operation another group fabricated a novel electrode by impregnating cationic nanohybrids of graphene oxide grafted quaternized chitosan to activated carbon electrodes go qc ac wang et al 2015 a cdi cell equipped with this novel electrode achieved an ultrahigh inactivation rate i e 99 9999 or 6 log reduction of escherichia coli during water desalination however a cdi unit with pristine activated carbon electrodes removed less than 82 8 of the viable bacteria present in feed waters although the mode of antimicrobial action by cdi has not yet been clearly elucidated the active oxidants e g hclo and ho generated during the electrochemical process could play an important roles in this process jeong et al 2006 in addition the h2o2 generated via cathodic oxygen reduction if combined with uv irradiation or o3 would also be expected to result in bacterial inactivation indeed previous studies have demonstrated that low concentrations of h2o2 20 150 μm combined with uv or o3 lead to enhancement in bacterial inactivation by 0 5 2 0 log units cho et al 2011 cho and yoon 2006 lanao et al 2008 rubio et al 2013 5 2 2 contaminant sequestration organic and inorganic micropollutants such as endocrine disrupting chemicals heavy metals nitrate and arsenic are prevalent in many water sources and in treated wastewaters which otherwise might be recycled cdi apart from removing inorganic salts by non faradaic means may also contribute to the removal of these pollutants through a combination of faradaic and non faradaic processes arsenic is naturally present in groundwaters at concentrations ranging from less than 0 5 μg l 1 to more than 5 mg l 1 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 groundwaters exhibiting arsenic concentrations well above the world health organization who guideline value for drinking water of 10 μg l 1 edition 2011 have been found in argentina chile mexico china and hungary and more recently in west bengal india bangladesh and vietnam mandal and suzuki 2002 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 as iii and as v are the predominant arsenic forms in natural waters with the former being more toxic than the latter pous et al 2015 as most arsenic sequestration technologies are not very effective in directly removing the dominant uncharged as iii species pre oxidation of as iii to as v is commonly used to improve the arsenic removal efficiency bissen and frimmel 2003 leupin and hug 2005 cdi is capable of serving as an alternative technique for arsenic removal with the potential for utilization of the combined effects of electro oxidation and electrosorption fan et al 2016 garrido et al 2009 lee et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 as reported by fan et al 2016 as iii can be anodically oxidized to as v followed by electrosorption of the in situ formed as v onto the surface of the anode following charging at 1 2 v for 120 min the arsenic concentrations decreased from 50 100 and 200 mg l 1 to 2 3 9 6 and 42 3 mg l 1 respectively with arsenic present in the treated water predominantly as as v it should be noted that in practical groundwater cases arsenic coexists with other inorganic anions and associated cations with the concentrations of these inorganic anions e g cl no3 and so4 2 several magnitudes higher than arsenic as such the impact of the presence of other inorganic salts on removal of arsenic by cdi from solution requires careful attention in addition to removal of salt and minor components from groundwaters consideration has also been given to treatment of municipal wastewater effluents these wastewaters typically contain a range of organic compounds with the chemical oxygen demand cod of these effluents ranging from 20 to 100 mg l 1 as well as inorganic salts at concentrations ranging from 100 to 1000 mg l 1 kim et al 2008 li et al 2011 recently duan et al 2015b employed cdi for the simultaneous removal of phenol and nacl from a synthetic wastewater the anodic oxidation of phenol was achieved in the cdi system through i the direct oxidation of phenol at the anode generating benzoquinone and catechol by hydroxylation and or ii the indirect mineralization by active chlorine which was generated through the anodic oxidation of cl eq 4 with the formation of chlorophenols as intermediate in this pathway these aromatic intermediates were then oxidized to carboxylic acids and ultimately to co2 in a similar manner liu et al 2016 confirmed that cdi was capable of breaking down naturally occurring humic substances via anodic electrochemical oxidation with subsequent electrosorption of oxidized humic substances and their derivatives this indicated that cdi technology may be of use in the pre treatment of drinking waters as it can decrease the extent of formation of disinfection by products by partial removal of natural organic matter precursors while several attempts have been made to remove heavy metals including cu ii huang et al 2014 cd ii huang et al 2016 pb ii yang et al 2014 and fe iii li et al 2010 from waters by cdi little mechanistic insight has been obtained with both non faradic electrosorption and cathodic reduction of cations expected to be of importance for the fixation of these heavy metals huang et al 2016 investigated the electro enhanced removal of cu ii from water using a cdi cell equipped with activated carbon electrodes when a low charging voltage of 0 4 v was applied cu ii appeared to be removed from solution via non faradaic processes with no apparent deposition of elemental cu on the cathode surface during charging at 0 8 v particles of 1 2 μm in size appeared on the electrode surface on further increase in charging voltage to 1 2 v large numbers of particles were generated and covered a significant portion of the electrode surface xps analysis revealed that these particles were a combination of metallic copper i e cu 0 and cuprous oxide i e cu2o confirming the occurrence of cathodic reduction of cu ii at relatively higher charging voltages 6 perspectives and outlook faradaic processes in cdi systems have attracted increasing interest in recent years with investigation of both oxidation and reduction reactions resulting from application of charging potential leading to a firmer understanding of both the benefits and pitfalls of faradaic effects here we provide a comprehensive review of faradaic reactions in cdi systems with particular attention given to cathodic oxygen reduction and anodic carbon oxidation one approach to gaining a perspective on the occurrence and impacts of cdi faradaic reactions is to utilize a flowchart as described in fig 9 with these reactions playing an important role in i mitigation or elimination of the undesired faradaic reactions in the system ii employment of particular reactions which can be useful for improving desalination performance or achieving cdi multifunctionality e g disinfection and micropollutant sequestration and iii enhancement of faradaic reaction mediated desalination based on pseudocapacitive effects charge efficiency in achieving particular water quality and water recovery rate targets is used as the key performance parameter in this analysis carbon electrode oxidation caused by faradaic reactions is one of the most critical issues in cdi long term operation with these reactions resulting in carbon electrode deterioration and desalination performance decline use of membrane cdi mcdi appears to be effective in eliminating cathodic oxygen reduction with an associated positive shift in electrode potential to the anode thereby reducing the rate and extent of carbon anode oxidation with resultant extension of electrode lifetime combining ion exchange polymers with carbon electrodes may also contribute to mitigation of carbon oxidation as well as alleviating resistance and ion exchange membrane cost issues that are associated with mcdi more detailed studies on this issue are required in order to refine the replacement of ion exchange membranes by carbon polymer composite electrodes there are very few examples showing that anodic chloride oxidation occurs in cdi systems with resultant production of active chlorine species that could be applied to in situ disinfection or indirect oxidant of organic pollutants this reaction is likely to occur in hybrid cdi systems equipped with both transition metal containing materials and carbon materials as electrodes where unequal potential distribution and or metal catalytic properties favor the oxidation of chloride at the anode one major concern is that the chloride oxidation process is likely to yield chlorinated byproducts potentially increasing the health hazards associated with drinking water purification using cdi in such systems monitoring the possible formation of chlorine by products such as chlorate perchlorate or organochlorine as well as oxidative products of the anion exchange membrane is recommended especially when using higher voltages for drinking water desalination cathodic oxygen reduction considering that the cathode potential is always expected to be lower than the redox potential of the oxygen reduction reaction will inevitably occur in cdi systems our recent findings have revealed that the dissolved oxygen concentration can serve as a simple and convenient indicator of the rate and extent of oxygen reduction a mechanically based kinetic model of the faradaic reactions occurring at the cathode has been developed and found to satisfactorily describe the variation of do consumed and h2o2 generated during cdi operation he et al 2016 the presence of h2o2 could provide the means of inducing disinfection or micropollutant degradation in the cdi system provided that h2o2 can be effectively activated to more powerful oxidants by for example uv photolysis or o3 addition ph fluctuation is another serious issue in cdi systems as it affects the treated water quality and potentially results in scaling issues at the cathode if large amounts of alkaline earth metal ions such as ca2 or mg2 are present although we have demonstrated that faradaic reactions contribute greatly to the ph fluctuations in cdi system with carbon electrodes non faradaic processes such as the differing transport and adsorption desorption rates of protons and hydroxyl ions may also play non negligible roles the contribution of faradaic and non faradaic processes to ph fluctuations should be elucidated as this will assist in developing feasible strategies to mitigate any side effects additionally in situ measurement e g by use of ph micro electrodes or modelling of the ph variation at near the electrode interface is required as this will enable further exploration of the mechanisms contributing to ph fluctuations to date most attention has focused on non faradaic processes i e capacitive ion storage in edls in cdi with limited attention given to faradaic processes despite the importance of these processes to both treated water quality and long term stability and performance of this technology as such some urgency exists with regard to improving our mechanistic understanding of faradaic reactions with the goal of effectively mitigating the negative effects of these processes whilst taking advantage of their positive effects it is encouraging to see that faradaic capacitive electrodes can contribute significantly to the enhancement of desalination performance through intercalation effects unlike the traditional carbon electrodes that take advantage of the pure edls for ion removal faradaic capacitive electrodes can remove ion species through faradaic reactions with high efficiency and low energy consumption most recently ultra high salt removal capacity of more than 100 mg g 1 was achieved when using these intercalation electrodes almost seven times higher than that of traditional static capacitive carbon electrodes however the stability of such electrodes particularly associated with the electrochemical leakage of metal ions is currently a major concern and an issue to which more attention should be paid furthermore it is necessary to develop cost effective stable and novel intercalation cathodes and anodes to meet the requirement of capturing multiple cations and anions from real saline waters 7 conclusions in conclusion a comprehensive overview of the types and mechanisms of faradaic reactions i e carbon electrode oxidation chloride oxidation dissolved oxygen reduction and faradaic ion storage reactions that may occur in cdi systems has been presented here the negative influences of these reactions on cdi lifetime and desalination performance has been described a number of strategies such as optimization of cell configuration modification of operational mode and fabrication of novel cdi electrodes have been proposed to reduce or even eliminate faradaic side effects it is also recognized that faradaic reactions have a variety of exciting and promising applications including the incorporation of intercalation electrodes for highly saline water desalination or value added ion separation recovery through reversible faradaic reactions and employment of particular reactions enabling cdi to fulfil its promise of multifunctionality including disinfection and micropollutant sequestration acknowledgement we gratefully acknowledge funding support from the australian research council through arc
