18860,high arsenic containing waste acid from the heavy nonferrous metallurgical sector cu pb zn ni sn etc one of the most dangerous arsenic hazardous wastes with extremely high arsenic concentrations has presented enormous challenges to the environment and caused severe environmental pollution over the past few decades due to the lack of affordable and environmentally friendly disposal technologies here we report a green process for the self enhanced and efficient removal of arsenic from waste acid using magnetite as an in situ iron donator firstly the room temperature predissolution of magnetite in waste acid provides initial iron ions as a starting precipitator of arsenic simultaneously providing a suitable ph range and an active surface that are ready for the nucleation and growth of scorodite afterwards arsenic is precipitated in form the of scorodite which is driven by a mutually improved cycle composed of arsenic precipitation and magnetite dissolution on the surface of magnetite particles this cycle creates a low supersaturation of iron and constant ph in the waste acid ensuring the continuous precipitation of arsenic as well crystallized and environmentally stable scorodite by using magnetite as an in situ iron donator via the reaction of 2fe3o4 6h3aso4 h2o2 6feaso4 10h2o under optimal conditions including a 6 h room temperature predissolution a 12 h atmospheric reaction at 90 c and a ph of 2 0 with a magnetite dosage at the fe3o4 as molar ratio the molar ratio of fe3o4 in magnetite to as in waste acid of 1 33 99 90 of arsenic was successively removed from waste acid with an initial arsenic concentration of 10300 mg l in combination with the good adaptability of this process the performed case study and prospective process show the successful removal of arsenic from waste acid as well as great potential for large scale applications graphical abstract image 102 keywords arsenic waste acid magnetite scorodite leaching toxicity 1 introduction the widespread occurrence of arsenic pollution is threatening our ecological environment and human health all over the world especially in developing countries smedley and kinniburgh 2002 the environmental exposure of arsenic is mainly caused by the extraction and separation of desirable elements from arsenic containing minerals and wastes in the nonferrous industry china suffers from arsenic emission and pollution because of its large heavy nonferrous metallurgical sector cu pb zn ni sn etc and the lack of affordable technologies for arsenic disposal arsenic emissions include slag sludge dust and wastewater with different levels of arsenic mobility and toxicity among these sources approximately 18 of the total arsenic in heavy nonferrous minerals is in the form of high arsenic containing waste acid which is one of the most dangerous arsenic hazardous wastes with extremely high arsenic mobility and leaching toxicity xiao et al 2008 the current disposal of waste acid always discharges an enormous quantity of secondary solid hazardous waste that presents enormous challenges to the environment and has caused severe environmental pollution over the past few decades chemical precipitation is currently the most widely used method for the treatment of arsenic containing waste acid liu et al 2015b paktunc et al 2008 neutralization precipitation is the most cost effective process for arsenic removal from waste acid in the form of arsenic bearing sludge guo et al 2015 however only a small portion of arsenic is fixed in the ca based fe based and arsenic sulfide based sludges because of the unstable phases arsenate arsenite and sulfide and residual arsenic bluteau et al 2009 these hazardous sludges will cause secondary pollution during transportation storage and disposal in this context the scorodite precipitation method has attracted increasing attention for the disposal of arsenic containing waste acid without the discharge of hazardous waste because of its high arsenic removal capacity and lower demand for iron compared to conventional iron arsenic coprecipitation jia et al 2012 majzlan et al 2012 meanwhile scorodite feaso4 2h2o is recognized as the best solid arsenic immobilization mineral due to its high stability theoretical arsenic content of up to 32 crystallized state easy liquid solid separation and low water content of slag caetano et al 2009 nazari et al 2017 scorodite is especially promising for the removal and immobilization of arsenic from waste acid with high arsenic concentrations the scorodite precipitation method has been developed and applied to various types of arsenic containing aqueous solutions using fe2 fe3 as an ionic iron source the use of a sulfate solution to synthesize a high crystallinity scorodite requires a temperature greater than 125 c under high pressures dutrizac and jambor 1988 mambote et al 2003 developed a thermodynamic model to predict the distribution and concentration of chemical species in the fe iii as iii so4 hydrothermal system hydrothermal scorodite synthesis can effectively remove arsenic from the sulfuric acid system however from an economic standpoint the synthesis of scorodite at atmospheric pressure and lower temperatures is more attractive drahota and filippi 2009 fujita et al 2008b 2008c fujita et al 2009 synthesized a high crystallinity scorodite at 95 c under atmospheric pressure in a fe ii as v h2o system le berre et al 2008 studied the transformation of poor crystallinity ferric arsenate into crystalline scorodite at a temperature of 80 c a ph of 2 and a reaction time of 12 h in addition to the temperature other conditions including ph iron to arsenic molar ratio fe as and reaction time also affect scorodite crystallization sun et al 2018 krause et al krause and ettel 1989 found that the ferric arsenate precipitate obtained in an aqueous solution with an fe as molar ratio equal to or higher than 4 has better stability and lower solubility the ph also has to be strictly controlled to obtain crystalline scorodite since the reaction itself is a typical h accumulation process wang and jia 2013 which presents a great challenge to the synthesis a longer reaction time is preferable for the consideration of both arsenic removal efficiency and the stability of scorodite fujita et al 2009 2012 all of these factors acutely affect scorodite synthesis at atmospheric pressure gomez et al 2011b jahromi and ghahreman 2018 in practice wastewater usually contains other heavy metals besides arsenic recent studies have indicated that the addition of cu2 zn2 and na only changes the redox potential of the system and does not have a significant effect on the composition structure and leachability of scorodite fujita et al 2008a and scorodite crystallization is independent of fesbo4 crystallization in the fe ii as v sb v h2o system kossoff et al 2015 although the abovementioned studies have significantly advanced the scorodite precipitation process and its applications using ionic iron sources for arsenic removal from an arsenic containing aqueous solution the process still suffers from drawbacks including initial ph values ranging from 1 to 3 h accumulation high concentrations of iron ions and relatively expensive iron sources the success of this process is largely dependent on the following five critical requirements i a suitable initial ph as the ph of waste acid must be neutralized to a favorable range ca 2 0 bluteau and demopoulos 2007 fujita et al 2009 krause and ettel 1988 and made ready for scorodite synthesis because the raw waste acid usually contains a high concentration of sulfuric acid and the loss of arsenic should be avoided ii a stable ph since the scorodite precipitation is accompanied with h accumulation and it is necessary to control a stable ph for the sustainable crystallization of scorodite by using the simultaneous neutralization of the increased acid iii low supersaturation of iron in the aqueous solution to generate scorodite with high crystallinity iv cost effective and reactive iron sources which can easily dissolve in the waste acid without introduction of new ions and liquids and v efficient arsenic removal through fast precipitation and crystallization to meet these requirements and avoid the abovementioned drawbacks we propose a self enhanced and efficient removal of arsenic from waste acid using magnetite as a cost effective and in situ iron source which can perfectly meet these five requirements simultaneously natural magnetite is highly efficient in the treatment of arsenic containing wastewater due to its good adsorbability an et al 2011 shahid et al 2018 magnetite mainly in the form of fe3o4 with an iron content of 63 4 is a very common and affordable mineral it can react with waste acid to adjust the ph to a suitable range providing iron ions ready for the initial precipitation of arsenic in forms of ferric arsenate or scorodite in addition the excessive magnetite in the waste acid will in turn neutralize the increased acid from the scorodite formation and help maintain a stable ph the objective of this work is to investigate the removal of arsenic from waste acid using magnetite the arsenic fixation mechanism in the atmospheric reaction between magnetite and waste acid is studied the transformation of precipitate structure morphology and leachability and the evolution of solution composition are combined to explore a mutually improved relationship between the precipitation of scorodite and the dissolution of magnetite to estimate the reactivity of magnetite in waste acid and the role of magnetite predissolution the effect of predissolution time and the dosage of magnetite are also studied the initial ph and reaction temperature of the scorodite synthesis are further optimized for the considerations of arsenic removal efficiency and stability of scorodite precipitates finally an arsenic removal process composed of magnetite dissolution precipitation of scorodite precipitate separation and recycling of magnetite is proposed for large scale applications in waste acid treatment 2 experimental section 2 1 materials and chemicals the arsenic containing waste acid used in the experiment was sampled from a copper smelting plant located in southwestern china the waste acid was discharged from the purification of flue gas readied for the sulfuric acid production system sox arsenic and other heavy metals in the flue gas were captured via water washing resulting in an acid waste water that is usually called waste acid the chemical composition of the waste acid is shown in table 1 the magnetite used in the experiment was sampled from a mining company in the yunnan dahongshan mine the chemical composition of the magnetite was analyzed by xrf as shown in table 2 all chemicals were of analytical grade naoh zhiyuan chemical tianjin china 96 30 h2o2 shentai chemical tianjin china 30 and h2so4 xilong chemical guangdong china 98 deionized water was used for all experiments 2 2 experimental procedure and apparatus the magnetite was ground and sieved to 100 200 mesh magnetite particles were added into 200 ml waste acid in a single mouth flask at fe3o4 as molar ratios ranging from 0 33 to 1 67 the fe3o4 as molar ratio is calculated according to the iron content in the magnetite and arsenic concentration in the waste acid h2o2 was also added to oxidize as iii to as v the single mouth flask was placed in a water bath and stirred at a rate of 200 r min for predissolution at room temperature the composition and ph of the waste acid during predissolution were analyzed after predissolution the synthesis of scorodite began at temperatures ranging from 60 c to 95 c with initial ph values ranging from 1 to 4 after scorodite synthesis the single mouth flask was cooled to room temperature the mixture after the reaction was filtered in an shz d iii type circulating water vacuum pump using a 0 45 μm microporous membrane the filtered precipitate was dried in a dhg 9240a type electric blast drying oven at 60 c for 12 h and the filtrate was collected in a beaker suitable for the composition analysis 2 3 characterizations the solid precipitates in the experiment were identified by x ray diffraction xrd carried out on a japan science d max 3b diffractometer equipped with a copper target λ cu kα 1 5046 å at a scanning rate of 5 min at a scanning angle 2θ range from 10 to 90 the mixtures of 0 5 dried precipitates and 99 5 kbr were finely ground to prepare thin slices using a tablet press for collecting the infrared spectra on a nicolet is 10 fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir thermo fisher scientific usa at a selected wavenumber region from 400 to 4000 cm 1 a field emission scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer sem eds quanta 450 fei usa was used to obtain the observation information on the morphology and elemental composition of the particles under high vacuum at 5 kv the chemical valence states of arsenic and iron in the dried solids were determined by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps k alpha thermo fisher scientific usa with a monochromatic al ka radiation 1486 6 ev and a base pressure of 1 10 8 torr in the analytical chamber the passage energy used in xps analysis was 50 ev and the c1s peak was used as a standard calibration peak at 284 8 ev all spectra were drawn and analyzed using avantage xps software leaching tests were conducted to examine the leachability of the precipitates according to the toxicity characterization leaching procedure tclp tests epa 1994 glacial acetic acid 5 7 ml and naoh solution 64 3 ml 1 mol l were sequentially added to 500 ml of distilled water and then diluted to 1 l to reach ph 4 93 0 05 to prepare a leaching agent a certain amount of natural drying precipitate was added into a 200 ml polyethylene bottle filled by the leaching agent at a liquid solid ratio of 20 1 l kg the sealed bottle was then fixed on a constant temperature oscillating box at 23 c and oscillated at an oscillation frequency of 110 t min for 18 h after the oscillation the supernatant was collected by quantitative filter paper and analyzed with an icp oes spectrometer analytik jena ag germany in all quantitative studies the arsenic removal efficiency η is the most important indicator of waste acid treatment and is calculated using the equation η co ct co 100 where co mg l is the initial arsenic concentration and ct mg l is the arsenic concentration after treatment 3 results and discussion 3 1 transformation of arsenic in waste acid into scorodite using magnetite we use magnetite as an in situ iron source for the arsenic removal from waste acid through the formation of scorodite magnetite acts as an initial neutralizer iron source for arsenic precipitation and neutralizer of accumulated h from arsenic precipitation before scorodite synthesis the predissolution of fe3o4 in magnetite neutralizes sulfuric acid in the waste acid via 2fe3o4 9h2so4 h2o2 3fe2 so4 3 10h2o providing iron ions for the initial arsenic precipitation in the following scorodite synthesis magnetite enables the continuous precipitation of arsenic as scorodite via fe2 so4 3 2h3aso4 2feaso4 3h2so4 at a relatively stable ph and a lower iron concentration because the accumulated h from the arsenic precipitation can be simultaneously consumed by the dissolution of the remaining magnetite to provide a new iron source for the subsequent arsenic precipitation daenzer et al 2014 shinoda et al 2009 here the arsenic precipitation and dissolution of magnetite compose a mutually improved cycle for the self enhanced and efficient removal of arsenic from the waste acid the total reaction of this arsenic removal process can be interpreted as 2fe3o4 6h3aso4 h2o2 6feaso4 10h2o ensuring a stable ph for the solution without the accumulation of h the transformation of arsenic in aqueous solutions into scorodite using ionic iron sources requires fe as molar ratios ranging from 1 to 4 ph values ranging from 1 to 3 and temperatures that reach 70 c with an oxidative atmosphere min et al 2015 paktunc et al 2008 here the arsenic removal from waste acid using magnetite as an iron source was investigated at fe3o4 as molar ratios ranged from 0 33 to 1 67 ph values ranged from 1 to 4 and temperatures ranged from 60 to 95 c as shown in section 3 2 the transformation of magnetite to scorodite in waste acid was investigated under optimal conditions including a fe3o4 as molar ratio of 1 33 a ph of 2 and 90 c according to section 3 2 the characteristic evolution of solids and liquids during arsenic precipitation is shown in fig 1 fig 1a illustrates the concentration of arsenic and iron ions in the waste acid and the arsenic removal efficiency with increasing time the arsenic concentration in the waste acid rapidly decreases with increasing reaction time it drops from 10300 mg l to 10 01 mg l after 12 h of reaction between magnetite and waste acid resulting in an arsenic removal efficiency of 99 90 thereafter the arsenic concentration remains stable in contrast to the obvious drop in arsenic concentration the iron concentration gradually increases with the reaction time indicating a continuous dissolution of magnetite particles eventually the composition of the aqueous solution reaches equilibrium after 12 h of reaction it is notable that the iron concentration is maintained at a low level 300 1000 mg l which is far lower than the required amount for arsenic removal in conventional synthesis using ionic iron sources gonzalezcontreras et al 2010 approximately 2 of the total iron in magnetite exists in the forms of fe2 and or fe3 in the aqueous solution allowing for a low supersaturation of iron ions during scorodite synthesis after magnetite predissolution the accumulated h produced from arsenic precipitation will dissolve the magnetite and release iron ions for continuous scorodite synthesis until most of the arsenic is exhausted the newly produced iron ions in the waste acid can react with the surrounding arsenic in a timely manner without the accumulation of iron ions in the aqueous solution this is why no significant increase of iron concentration was observed during the arsenic precipitation fig 1a the mutually improved cycle between the magnetite dissolution and the arsenic precipitation enables the removal of arsenic from the waste acid at a very low iron concentration in the aqueous solution by using magnetite as an in situ iron donator this self enhanced behavior can remove arsenic as well crystallized and environmentally stable scorodite fig 1b and c fig 1b shows that the concentration of leached arsenic in the tclp of the precipitate dramatically decreases when the reaction time increases from 6 to 12 h the concentration of leached arsenic for precipitate obtained in a 12 h reaction is 1 2 mg l which is much lower than the regulatory limit 5 mg l designating hazardous waste the phase composition and surface information of the precipitates obtained during the atmospheric reaction were detected by xrd and ftir as shown in fig 1c and d the weak characteristic peaks corresponding to the scorodite structured feaso4 2h2o show the pattern of the precipitate obtained in the 6 h reaction fe3o4 remains the main phase the characteristic peaks of unreacted feso4 4h2o are also reveal in the pattern suggesting that some fe2 ions accumulate on the surface of magnetite particles because of its dissolution correspondingly a high arsenic concentration of 4400 mg l remains in the waste acid because of the lack of reaction time for the arsenic precipitation after 12 h of reaction scorodite and magnetite were the main phases in the precipitate while the characteristic peaks of feso4 4h2o were reduced to a very low intensity a high arsenic removal efficiency of 99 90 was achieved and the dissolution of magnetite slowed after 12 h a reaction of 12 h was found to be sufficient for arsenic precipitation and scorodite formation the ftir gives the surface information for the precipitates obtained from the different reaction times as shown in fig 1d in addition to the confirmation of the existence of phase compositions in fig 1c it also provides the evolution of the surface species that can probe the arsenic removal mechanism via the dissolution crystallization mutually improved cycle the stretching vibration bands of as v oh or as v ofe at 822 cm 1 support the existence of the scorodite structure identified by xrd jia et al 2007 the so4 2 stretching vibration band at 1124 cm 1 indicates the presence of feso4 4h2o suggesting sufficient iron sources for the formation and crystallization of feaso4 gomez et al 2011a the absorption peak of crystal water at 1629 cm 1 might be attributed to scorodite and sulfates baghurst et al 1996 gomez et al 2010 correspondingly hydroxyl stretching vibrational absorption peaks of crystal water at 3517 cm 1 and 2988 cm 1 were observed the band from feo at 1384 cm 1 should be derived from the fe3o4 magnetite structure yuan et al 2016 the sem images in fig 2 illustrate the morphological change of the precipitate as a function of reaction time an obvious orthorhombic dipyramidal scorodite crystal was observed in the precipitates the composition of scorodite was further confirmed by eds results the scorodite crystal can be synthesized within a short time of 6 h and grows larger with increasing reaction time only a few submicron scale irregular polyhedrons or sheets are sparsely dispersed on the surface of the magnetite particles fig 2a b and 2c after 6 h of reaction a large amount of unreacted magnetite remains in the precipitate more micron scale octahedrons are densely dispersed on the surface of the magnetite particles with increasing reaction time this morphological change indicates that scorodite grows on the surface of the magnetite because of the surrounding abundant iron ions from the successive dissolution of magnetite a reaction time longer than 12 h slightly affects the morphology of the scorodite crystal this may be due to the large amount of scorodite attached to the surface of the magnetite which prevents the magnetite from continuing to dissolve and release iron ions at the same time the surface of the relatively large scorodite particles is covered by the secondary submicron scorodite due to the lack of arsenic in the aqueous solution the fully covered surface of magnetite might also prevent the formation of larger crystals because the number of attachment points is largely reduced less magnetite dissolves when no more scorodite precipitates because of the lack of arsenic in the residual solution the transformation of the chemical valence states of arsenic and iron in the precipitates are shown in figs 3 and 4 the as 3d spectrum of the precipitate is deconvoluted into two individual peaks derived from as iii and as v that overlap each other according to nesbitt et al 1995 and lim et al 2009 the as 3d5 2 peaks for as iii and as v were set to bind energy ranges of 44 00 45 50 ev and 45 2 46 8 ev respectively as shown in fig 3 the peaks at binding energies of 45 08 44 17 44 68 45 03 ev and 46 00 45 39 45 36 45 54 ev are assigned to as iii and as v respectively the fe2p xps patterns of the precipitates were fitted using the nonlinear method according to mc biesinger et al 2011 as shown in fig 4 the peaks at binding energies of 709 98 709 48 709 48 710 18 ev and 712 38 711 68 712 68 712 28 ev are assigned to fe ii and fe iii respectively the distributions of valence states of arsenic and iron are given in table 3 the peaks assigned to as v in fig 3 and peaks assigned to fe iii in fig 4 gradually increase with the reaction proceeding from 6 to 12 h and then remain relatively stable with increasing reaction time correspondingly the molar ratios of as v as iii and fe iii fe ii first increase with increasing reaction time and then tend to be flat this indicates that the crystallization and growth of scorodite result in an accumulation of as v and fe iii via the dissolution of magnetite the oxidation of fe ii and as iii and the precipitation of as v in the form of amorphous feaso4 in addition both the fe iii fe ii and as v as iii ratios might also be affected by the redox between fe iii and as iii liu et al 2015a after 12 h of reaction the stable distribution of arsenic and iron valence reveals that both arsenic precipitation and magnetite dissolution might proceed at very low reaction rates the arsenic precipitation in the form of feaso4 and the dissolution of feaso4 reaches an equilibrium and no more scorodite forms 3 2 reaction behavior of magnetite in waste acid 3 2 1 effect of predissolution time a room temperature predissolution of magnetite in waste acid was used to introduce an adequate amount of iron into the waste acid to initiate the arsenic precipitation and neutralize the waste acid to a suitable ph range ready for scorodite synthesis after predissolution the acidity of the waste acid is largely reduced and the ph can be lowered to a range from 1 to 2 the solid liquid mixture will be directly transferred to the atmospheric scorodite synthesis with a ph adjustment using naoh or without any treatment a room temperature atmospheric dissolution is preferable from an economic standpoint fig 5 shows that the concentration of arsenic in the waste acid decreases from 10300 mg l to 8144 mg l after the predissolution but decreases slowly with the extension of the dissolution time the iron concentration and ph in the waste acid slowly increase as the predissolution time increases as shown in fig 6 the reacted magnetite has a smaller particle size than the fresh magnetite and the particles become smooth with newly produced white particles adhering to the surface the dissolution of magnetite results in increases in the concentration of iron ions and ph the loss of approximately 2200 mg l of arsenic in the predissolution should be ascribed to the formation of amorphous ferric arsenate at the same time due to the strong adsorption of magnetite powder liu et al 2015a some arsenic ions are adsorbed on the surface of the magnetite as shown in fig 6 which can enhance the arsenic precipitation and the subsequent crystallization of scorodite increasing the dissolution time will not increase the iron ion concentration or ph of the aqueous solution the ph of the waste acid after predissolution is close to 1 2 resulting in a weak driving force of dissolution because of the equilibrium limitation in an h depletive aqueous solution six hours of predissolution of magnetite in waste acid is adequate for the subsequent scorodite synthesis 3 2 2 effect of magnetite dosage the dosage of magnetite affects the initial iron concentration in the waste acid and the initial ph after predissolution the contact surface area between the magnetite and waste acid will also be determined by the dosage of magnetite fig 7 a shows that the arsenic concentration decreases gradually with increasing magnetite dosage while the iron concentration dramatically increases from 154 mg l to 688 mg l followed by an increase of ph from 0 85 to 1 22 this might be because the increase of magnetite dosage enlarges the contact surface area between the magnetite and the reactants h and arsenic in the waste acid providing more iron ions and a higher initial ph which is favorable for arsenic precipitation in the subsequent scorodite synthesis figs 7b 8c and 8 d show that the well crystallized scorodite is synthesized when a suitable amount of magnetite is used a fe3o4 as molar ratio of 1 33 is suitable for arsenic removal and ratios higher than 1 33 have no significant influence on the arsenic removal efficiency because of the weak solubility of magnetite in an aqueous solution with higher ph values often scorodite is synthesized using an ionic iron source at high fe as molar ratios ranging from 3 to 4 this conventional method usually suffers from the poor crystallinity of precipitates due to the coexistence of amorphous ferric arsenate to obtain large sized and well crystallized scorodite the supersaturation of iron and arsenic in the aqueous solution must be avoided by adding seed crystals and controlling the oxidation atmosphere demopoulos et al 1995 fujita et al 2008b 2008c interestingly we found that the scorodite here was synthesized at a very low fe as molar ratio 1 12 in the waste acid using magnetite as an in situ iron source via a mutually improved cycle composed of magnetite dissolution and arsenic precipitation in addition we noticed that both the amorphous ferric arsenate and scorodite crystals grew on the surface of magnetite particles at a very low iron concentration therefore this phenomenon further confirms the reaction pathway i magnetite particles dissolve in the waste acid to release iron ions and neutralize h and magnetite helps to adsorb arsenic and enrich the surface arsenic ions ii the iron ion enriched surface of magnetite is likely to precipitate the surrounding arsenic ions via the formation of amorphous ferric arsenate iii the h generated from ferric arsenate formation will in turn improve the in situ dissolution of magnetite to provide more iron ions for the subsequent arsenic precipitation and iv steps ii and iii alternately or simultaneously occur in a mutually improved mode until the arsenic depletes and a thermodynamic limitation is reached 3 2 3 effect of ph value the scorodite synthesis is very sensitive to the ph in both high pressure and atmospheric reactions using ionic iron sources demopoulos et al 1995 singhania et al 2005 2006 the influence of ph on scorodite synthesis in waste acid using magnetite was investigated in a ph range from 1 2 initial to 4 0 as shown in fig 8 after predissolution some of the waste acid samples with an initial ph of 1 2 are be adjusted to 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 4 0 by naoh solution fig 8a shows that the lowest arsenic concentration of the reacted waste acid was obtained at a ph of 2 fig 8b and c indicate that well crystallized scorodite could be produced at ph values of 1 5 and 2 the lowest leached arsenic concentration of precipitate was obtained at a ph of 2 with the highest removal efficiency of arsenic this result suggests that ph values ranging from 1 5 to 2 are favorable for the formation of amorphous ferric arsenate and the subsequent transformation of amorphous ferric arsenate into scorodite the crystallization of scorodite is derived from the competition between the formation and dissolution of amorphous ferric arsenate in the acid solution langmuir et al 2006 the accumulation of amorphous ferric arsenate in a suitable ph range 1 5 2 is favorable for scorodite crystallization paktunc et al 2008 subsequently the conversion of amorphous arsenate to scorodite can be rapidly completed within 12 h a lower ph 1 5 will accelerate the dissolution of amorphous ferric arsenate while a higher ph 2 will result in the coprecipitation of basic compounds goethite and jarosite and sulfate ferric sulfate inhibiting the crystallization of scorodite moreover higher ph values make it difficult to dissolve magnetite and no more iron ions will be released combined with the ftir of the precipitate of fig 8d all precipitates show a stretching vibration absorption band of as v oh or as v ofe with a wavenumber of 822 cm 1 the strongest vibration absorption band was observed at a ph of 2 the two peaks at 3517 cm 1 and 2988 cm 1 corresponding to the hydroxyl bonds in the water in the crystal were observed in the spectra of precipitates obtained at ph values of 1 5 and 2 it is indicated that amorphous arsenate was formed but not converted into scorodite at initial ph values of 2 5 and 4 3 2 4 effect of reaction temperature the stability of scorodite is a very important indicator for evaluating the efficiency of arsenic immobilization in scorodite the formation of environmentally stable scorodite typically requires temperatures near the boiling point of the solution or higher ke et al 2018 a higher temperature tends to produce more stable and larger scorodite particles with a high arsenic removal efficiency gomez et al 2011b moreover the reaction temperature in our experiment is important for the intensification of the mutually improved cycle composed of magnetite dissolution and arsenic precipitation liu et al 2010 fig 9 shows that increasing the temperature can intensify the kinetics of arsenic precipitation and transformation of amorphous ferric arsenate into scorodite one observation is that the induction period below 90 c leads to the initial nucleation of fresh scorodite at the magnetite surface the leaching arsenic concentration of the poorly crystallized scorodite obtained at 80 c in this induction period reaches 68 mg l at higher temperatures 90 c the induction period was shortened and the well crystallized scorodite could be synthesized following a high arsenic removal efficiency fig 9c this may be attributed to two fundamental reasons a suitable local supersaturation created by the fe enriched surface and controlling a low iron concentration in the surrounding waste acid which facilitates the kinetics of scorodite crystallization the poor crystallinity of the scorodite precursor feaso4 2 x h2o is related to the discovery by dutrizac et al dutrizac and jambor 1988 that the formation of scorodite at low temperatures tends to leave some amorphous material on its surface which increases the apparent solubility of the scorodite evidently when the reaction temperature reaches 90 c we obtained precipitates with well crystallized scorodite structures as shown in fig 9c and d the increase in temperature is not only beneficial to the dissolution of magnetite to release more iron ions but also enhances the kinetics of secondary scorodite nucleation papangelakis and demopoulos 2013 therefore the minimum temperature for scorodite synthesis is considered to be 90 c under the experimental conditions 3 3 prospective process for waste acid treatment using magnetite the results of sections 3 1 and 3 2 were obtained using waste acid with an arsenic concentration of 10 3 g l and a sulfuric acid concentration of 72 5 g l considering the feasibility in the nonferrous industry this technology should be effective for waste acids with changing compositions since the concentrations of two main components arsenic and sulfuric acid in waste acid will fluctuate in large ranges 1 30 g l for arsenic and 20 150 g l for sulfuric acid to further explore the applicability of the waste acid treatment using magnetite the tolerance of arsenic and sulfuric acid concentrations of waste acid in this new proposed technology were investigated the arsenic removal experiments of waste acid with arsenic concentrations ranging from 6 g l to 42 g l and sulfuric acid concentrations ranging from 40 g l to 280 g l were conducted at the optimal conditions obtained in section 3 2 the summary of arsenic removal efficiencies η and the applicable scope of concentrations of arsenic and sulfuric acid are shown in fig 10 magnetite was founded to be effective for the arsenic removal from waste acid at a higher sulfuric acid concentration the waste acid with higher sulfuric acid concentrations is more reactive towards magnetite and donates abundant initial iron ions to initiate arsenic precipitation however magnetite is difficult to dissolve in waste acid with low sulfuric acid concentrations without the plenty of iron ions in the solution the arsenic precipitation cannot continue for the arsenic removal at a high sulfuric acid concentration high arsenic removal efficiencies around 99 can be achieved for the waste acid with arsenic concentrations ranging from 10 g l to 42 g l these results show that magnetite is a highly adaptive reagent for the arsenic removal from waste acid and it can handle the treatment of waste acid with changing compositions to a great extent even only an arsenic removal efficiency of 50 was obtained for the waste acid with low concentrations of arsenic 6 g l and sulfuric acid 40 g l by using the magnetite at the optimal condition obtained in section 3 2 it is believed that the arsenic removal efficiency will be further improved when the magnetite with higher surface areas and more suitable reaction conditions are applied to this type of waste acid based on the abovementioned results we propose a prospective process for waste acid treatment using magnetite as shown in fig 11 the process is composed of the predissolution of magnetite scorodite synthesis solid liquid separation scorodite magnetite magnetic separation high efficiency purification of residual arsenic bearing solution using fresh magnetite and recycling of unreacted magnetite fresh magnetite is added to the waste acid for the room temperature predissolution and atmospheric scorodite synthesis at temperatures of 90 c or higher after the atmospheric reaction most of the arsenic will be removed from the waste acid in the form of scorodite resulting in a residual solution with an arsenic concentration of approximately 10 mg l target concentration and a final ph of approximately 2 0 the obtained environmentally friendly scorodite can be separated from the precipitate by magnetic separation while magnetite can be reused for recycling as a nonhazardous solid waste the arsenic enriched scorodite will be stored in a slag dump equipped with the corresponding leakage resistant waterproofed and loss resistant measures to achieve a high efficiency purification of arsenic in residual waste acid we take advantage of the adsorbability of fresh magnetite to remove the arsenic concentration from approximately 10 mg l to a lower level 0 5 mg l other heavy metals in the residual waste acid will also be simultaneously removed the arsenic adsorbed magnetite can be reused as the raw material the final arsenic free wastewater will be neutralized or purified in the next step to completely remove contaminants acid heavy metals fluorine chloride etc to obtain clean water bakshi et al 2018 tang et al 2017 e g neutralization using lime is a cost effective option in the current industry the proposed process shows high potential for large scale applications for arsenic removal from waste acid using magnetite magnetite is used as an affordable iron source with a very high iron utilization efficiency the arsenic can be effectively removed by magnetite from waste acid without emissions of hazardous solid waste in addition the magnetite predissolution can also partially act as the neutralization reagent 4 conclusions this study demonstrates an environmentally friendly process for the self enhanced and efficient removal of arsenic from waste acid using magnetite as an in situ iron donator magnetite acts as a neutralization reagent and initial iron source during predissolution providing a suitable ph starting iron ions and abundant adsorption sites for the induction of arsenic precipitation and the subsequent crystallization of scorodite the sustainable crystallization of scorodite in the atmospheric reaction is continuously driven by the mutually improved cycle composed of arsenic precipitation and magnetite dissolution on the surface of magnetite particles and the total reaction can be interpreted as 2fe3o4 6h3aso4 h2o2 6feaso4 10h2o well crystallized and environmentally stable scorodite can be synthesized using magnetite because of the low supersaturation of iron ions in the solution allowing the direct and efficient utilization of iron in magnetite for waste acid with an initial arsenic concentration of 10030 mg l and a sulfuric acid concentration of 7250 mg l magnetite can remove 99 90 of the arsenic in the form of scorodite under optimal conditions including a 6 h room temperature predissolution and a 12 h atmospheric reaction at 90 c and a ph of 2 0 with a magnetite dosage at a fe3o4 as molar ratio of 1 33 magnetite also shows favorable adaptability for waste acid with changing compositions

18860,high arsenic containing waste acid from the heavy nonferrous metallurgical sector cu pb zn ni sn etc one of the most dangerous arsenic hazardous wastes with extremely high arsenic concentrations has presented enormous challenges to the environment and caused severe environmental pollution over the past few decades due to the lack of affordable and environmentally friendly disposal technologies here we report a green process for the self enhanced and efficient removal of arsenic from waste acid using magnetite as an in situ iron donator firstly the room temperature predissolution of magnetite in waste acid provides initial iron ions as a starting precipitator of arsenic simultaneously providing a suitable ph range and an active surface that are ready for the nucleation and growth of scorodite afterwards arsenic is precipitated in form the of scorodite which is driven by a mutually improved cycle composed of arsenic precipitation and magnetite dissolution on the surface of magnetite particles this cycle creates a low supersaturation of iron and constant ph in the waste acid ensuring the continuous precipitation of arsenic as well crystallized and environmentally stable scorodite by using magnetite as an in situ iron donator via the reaction of 2fe3o4 6h3aso4 h2o2 6feaso4 10h2o under optimal conditions including a 6 h room temperature predissolution a 12 h atmospheric reaction at 90 c and a ph of 2 0 with a magnetite dosage at the fe3o4 as molar ratio the molar ratio of fe3o4 in magnetite to as in waste acid of 1 33 99 90 of arsenic was successively removed from waste acid with an initial arsenic concentration of 10300 mg l in combination with the good adaptability of this process the performed case study and prospective process show the successful removal of arsenic from waste acid as well as great potential for large scale applications graphical abstract image 102 keywords arsenic waste acid magnetite scorodite leaching toxicity 1 introduction the widespread occurrence of arsenic pollution is threatening our ecological environment and human health all over the world especially in developing countries smedley and kinniburgh 2002 the environmental exposure of arsenic is mainly caused by the extraction and separation of desirable elements from arsenic containing minerals and wastes in the nonferrous industry china suffers from arsenic emission and pollution because of its large heavy nonferrous metallurgical sector cu pb zn ni sn etc and the lack of affordable technologies for arsenic disposal arsenic emissions include slag sludge dust and wastewater with different levels of arsenic mobility and toxicity among these sources approximately 18 of the total arsenic in heavy nonferrous minerals is in the form of high arsenic containing waste acid which is one of the most dangerous arsenic hazardous wastes with extremely high arsenic mobility and leaching toxicity xiao et al 2008 the current disposal of waste acid always discharges an enormous quantity of secondary solid hazardous waste that presents enormous challenges to the environment and has caused severe environmental pollution over the past few decades chemical precipitation is currently the most widely used method for the treatment of arsenic containing waste acid liu et al 2015b paktunc et al 2008 neutralization precipitation is the most cost effective process for arsenic removal from waste acid in the form of arsenic bearing sludge guo et al 2015 however only a small portion of arsenic is fixed in the ca based fe based and arsenic sulfide based sludges because of the unstable phases arsenate arsenite and sulfide and residual arsenic bluteau et al 2009 these hazardous sludges will cause secondary pollution during transportation storage and disposal in this context the scorodite precipitation method has attracted increasing attention for the disposal of arsenic containing waste acid without the discharge of hazardous waste because of its high arsenic removal capacity and lower demand for iron compared to conventional iron arsenic coprecipitation jia et al 2012 majzlan et al 2012 meanwhile scorodite feaso4 2h2o is recognized as the best solid arsenic immobilization mineral due to its high stability theoretical arsenic content of up to 32 crystallized state easy liquid solid separation and low water content of slag caetano et al 2009 nazari et al 2017 scorodite is especially promising for the removal and immobilization of arsenic from waste acid with high arsenic concentrations the scorodite precipitation method has been developed and applied to various types of arsenic containing aqueous solutions using fe2 fe3 as an ionic iron source the use of a sulfate solution to synthesize a high crystallinity scorodite requires a temperature greater than 125 c under high pressures dutrizac and jambor 1988 mambote et al 2003 developed a thermodynamic model to predict the distribution and concentration of chemical species in the fe iii as iii so4 hydrothermal system hydrothermal scorodite synthesis can effectively remove arsenic from the sulfuric acid system however from an economic standpoint the synthesis of scorodite at atmospheric pressure and lower temperatures is more attractive drahota and filippi 2009 fujita et al 2008b 2008c fujita et al 2009 synthesized a high crystallinity scorodite at 95 c under atmospheric pressure in a fe ii as v h2o system le berre et al 2008 studied the transformation of poor crystallinity ferric arsenate into crystalline scorodite at a temperature of 80 c a ph of 2 and a reaction time of 12 h in addition to the temperature other conditions including ph iron to arsenic molar ratio fe as and reaction time also affect scorodite crystallization sun et al 2018 krause et al krause and ettel 1989 found that the ferric arsenate precipitate obtained in an aqueous solution with an fe as molar ratio equal to or higher than 4 has better stability and lower solubility the ph also has to be strictly controlled to obtain crystalline scorodite since the reaction itself is a typical h accumulation process wang and jia 2013 which presents a great challenge to the synthesis a longer reaction time is preferable for the consideration of both arsenic removal efficiency and the stability of scorodite fujita et al 2009 2012 all of these factors acutely affect scorodite synthesis at atmospheric pressure gomez et al 2011b jahromi and ghahreman 2018 in practice wastewater usually contains other heavy metals besides arsenic recent studies have indicated that the addition of cu2 zn2 and na only changes the redox potential of the system and does not have a significant effect on the composition structure and leachability of scorodite fujita et al 2008a and scorodite crystallization is independent of fesbo4 crystallization in the fe ii as v sb v h2o system kossoff et al 2015 although the abovementioned studies have significantly advanced the scorodite precipitation process and its applications using ionic iron sources for arsenic removal from an arsenic containing aqueous solution the process still suffers from drawbacks including initial ph values ranging from 1 to 3 h accumulation high concentrations of iron ions and relatively expensive iron sources the success of this process is largely dependent on the following five critical requirements i a suitable initial ph as the ph of waste acid must be neutralized to a favorable range ca 2 0 bluteau and demopoulos 2007 fujita et al 2009 krause and ettel 1988 and made ready for scorodite synthesis because the raw waste acid usually contains a high concentration of sulfuric acid and the loss of arsenic should be avoided ii a stable ph since the scorodite precipitation is accompanied with h accumulation and it is necessary to control a stable ph for the sustainable crystallization of scorodite by using the simultaneous neutralization of the increased acid iii low supersaturation of iron in the aqueous solution to generate scorodite with high crystallinity iv cost effective and reactive iron sources which can easily dissolve in the waste acid without introduction of new ions and liquids and v efficient arsenic removal through fast precipitation and crystallization to meet these requirements and avoid the abovementioned drawbacks we propose a self enhanced and efficient removal of arsenic from waste acid using magnetite as a cost effective and in situ iron source which can perfectly meet these five requirements simultaneously natural magnetite is highly efficient in the treatment of arsenic containing wastewater due to its good adsorbability an et al 2011 shahid et al 2018 magnetite mainly in the form of fe3o4 with an iron content of 63 4 is a very common and affordable mineral it can react with waste acid to adjust the ph to a suitable range providing iron ions ready for the initial precipitation of arsenic in forms of ferric arsenate or scorodite in addition the excessive magnetite in the waste acid will in turn neutralize the increased acid from the scorodite formation and help maintain a stable ph the objective of this work is to investigate the removal of arsenic from waste acid using magnetite the arsenic fixation mechanism in the atmospheric reaction between magnetite and waste acid is studied the transformation of precipitate structure morphology and leachability and the evolution of solution composition are combined to explore a mutually improved relationship between the precipitation of scorodite and the dissolution of magnetite to estimate the reactivity of magnetite in waste acid and the role of magnetite predissolution the effect of predissolution time and the dosage of magnetite are also studied the initial ph and reaction temperature of the scorodite synthesis are further optimized for the considerations of arsenic removal efficiency and stability of scorodite precipitates finally an arsenic removal process composed of magnetite dissolution precipitation of scorodite precipitate separation and recycling of magnetite is proposed for large scale applications in waste acid treatment 2 experimental section 2 1 materials and chemicals the arsenic containing waste acid used in the experiment was sampled from a copper smelting plant located in southwestern china the waste acid was discharged from the purification of flue gas readied for the sulfuric acid production system sox arsenic and other heavy metals in the flue gas were captured via water washing resulting in an acid waste water that is usually called waste acid the chemical composition of the waste acid is shown in table 1 the magnetite used in the experiment was sampled from a mining company in the yunnan dahongshan mine the chemical composition of the magnetite was analyzed by xrf as shown in table 2 all chemicals were of analytical grade naoh zhiyuan chemical tianjin china 96 30 h2o2 shentai chemical tianjin china 30 and h2so4 xilong chemical guangdong china 98 deionized water was used for all experiments 2 2 experimental procedure and apparatus the magnetite was ground and sieved to 100 200 mesh magnetite particles were added into 200 ml waste acid in a single mouth flask at fe3o4 as molar ratios ranging from 0 33 to 1 67 the fe3o4 as molar ratio is calculated according to the iron content in the magnetite and arsenic concentration in the waste acid h2o2 was also added to oxidize as iii to as v the single mouth flask was placed in a water bath and stirred at a rate of 200 r min for predissolution at room temperature the composition and ph of the waste acid during predissolution were analyzed after predissolution the synthesis of scorodite began at temperatures ranging from 60 c to 95 c with initial ph values ranging from 1 to 4 after scorodite synthesis the single mouth flask was cooled to room temperature the mixture after the reaction was filtered in an shz d iii type circulating water vacuum pump using a 0 45 μm microporous membrane the filtered precipitate was dried in a dhg 9240a type electric blast drying oven at 60 c for 12 h and the filtrate was collected in a beaker suitable for the composition analysis 2 3 characterizations the solid precipitates in the experiment were identified by x ray diffraction xrd carried out on a japan science d max 3b diffractometer equipped with a copper target λ cu kα 1 5046 å at a scanning rate of 5 min at a scanning angle 2θ range from 10 to 90 the mixtures of 0 5 dried precipitates and 99 5 kbr were finely ground to prepare thin slices using a tablet press for collecting the infrared spectra on a nicolet is 10 fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir thermo fisher scientific usa at a selected wavenumber region from 400 to 4000 cm 1 a field emission scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer sem eds quanta 450 fei usa was used to obtain the observation information on the morphology and elemental composition of the particles under high vacuum at 5 kv the chemical valence states of arsenic and iron in the dried solids were determined by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps k alpha thermo fisher scientific usa with a monochromatic al ka radiation 1486 6 ev and a base pressure of 1 10 8 torr in the analytical chamber the passage energy used in xps analysis was 50 ev and the c1s peak was used as a standard calibration peak at 284 8 ev all spectra were drawn and analyzed using avantage xps software leaching tests were conducted to examine the leachability of the precipitates according to the toxicity characterization leaching procedure tclp tests epa 1994 glacial acetic acid 5 7 ml and naoh solution 64 3 ml 1 mol l were sequentially added to 500 ml of distilled water and then diluted to 1 l to reach ph 4 93 0 05 to prepare a leaching agent a certain amount of natural drying precipitate was added into a 200 ml polyethylene bottle filled by the leaching agent at a liquid solid ratio of 20 1 l kg the sealed bottle was then fixed on a constant temperature oscillating box at 23 c and oscillated at an oscillation frequency of 110 t min for 18 h after the oscillation the supernatant was collected by quantitative filter paper and analyzed with an icp oes spectrometer analytik jena ag germany in all quantitative studies the arsenic removal efficiency η is the most important indicator of waste acid treatment and is calculated using the equation η co ct co 100 where co mg l is the initial arsenic concentration and ct mg l is the arsenic concentration after treatment 3 results and discussion 3 1 transformation of arsenic in waste acid into scorodite using magnetite we use magnetite as an in situ iron source for the arsenic removal from waste acid through the formation of scorodite magnetite acts as an initial neutralizer iron source for arsenic precipitation and neutralizer of accumulated h from arsenic precipitation before scorodite synthesis the predissolution of fe3o4 in magnetite neutralizes sulfuric acid in the waste acid via 2fe3o4 9h2so4 h2o2 3fe2 so4 3 10h2o providing iron ions for the initial arsenic precipitation in the following scorodite synthesis magnetite enables the continuous precipitation of arsenic as scorodite via fe2 so4 3 2h3aso4 2feaso4 3h2so4 at a relatively stable ph and a lower iron concentration because the accumulated h from the arsenic precipitation can be simultaneously consumed by the dissolution of the remaining magnetite to provide a new iron source for the subsequent arsenic precipitation daenzer et al 2014 shinoda et al 2009 here the arsenic precipitation and dissolution of magnetite compose a mutually improved cycle for the self enhanced and efficient removal of arsenic from the waste acid the total reaction of this arsenic removal process can be interpreted as 2fe3o4 6h3aso4 h2o2 6feaso4 10h2o ensuring a stable ph for the solution without the accumulation of h the transformation of arsenic in aqueous solutions into scorodite using ionic iron sources requires fe as molar ratios ranging from 1 to 4 ph values ranging from 1 to 3 and temperatures that reach 70 c with an oxidative atmosphere min et al 2015 paktunc et al 2008 here the arsenic removal from waste acid using magnetite as an iron source was investigated at fe3o4 as molar ratios ranged from 0 33 to 1 67 ph values ranged from 1 to 4 and temperatures ranged from 60 to 95 c as shown in section 3 2 the transformation of magnetite to scorodite in waste acid was investigated under optimal conditions including a fe3o4 as molar ratio of 1 33 a ph of 2 and 90 c according to section 3 2 the characteristic evolution of solids and liquids during arsenic precipitation is shown in fig 1 fig 1a illustrates the concentration of arsenic and iron ions in the waste acid and the arsenic removal efficiency with increasing time the arsenic concentration in the waste acid rapidly decreases with increasing reaction time it drops from 10300 mg l to 10 01 mg l after 12 h of reaction between magnetite and waste acid resulting in an arsenic removal efficiency of 99 90 thereafter the arsenic concentration remains stable in contrast to the obvious drop in arsenic concentration the iron concentration gradually increases with the reaction time indicating a continuous dissolution of magnetite particles eventually the composition of the aqueous solution reaches equilibrium after 12 h of reaction it is notable that the iron concentration is maintained at a low level 300 1000 mg l which is far lower than the required amount for arsenic removal in conventional synthesis using ionic iron sources gonzalezcontreras et al 2010 approximately 2 of the total iron in magnetite exists in the forms of fe2 and or fe3 in the aqueous solution allowing for a low supersaturation of iron ions during scorodite synthesis after magnetite predissolution the accumulated h produced from arsenic precipitation will dissolve the magnetite and release iron ions for continuous scorodite synthesis until most of the arsenic is exhausted the newly produced iron ions in the waste acid can react with the surrounding arsenic in a timely manner without the accumulation of iron ions in the aqueous solution this is why no significant increase of iron concentration was observed during the arsenic precipitation fig 1a the mutually improved cycle between the magnetite dissolution and the arsenic precipitation enables the removal of arsenic from the waste acid at a very low iron concentration in the aqueous solution by using magnetite as an in situ iron donator this self enhanced behavior can remove arsenic as well crystallized and environmentally stable scorodite fig 1b and c fig 1b shows that the concentration of leached arsenic in the tclp of the precipitate dramatically decreases when the reaction time increases from 6 to 12 h the concentration of leached arsenic for precipitate obtained in a 12 h reaction is 1 2 mg l which is much lower than the regulatory limit 5 mg l designating hazardous waste the phase composition and surface information of the precipitates obtained during the atmospheric reaction were detected by xrd and ftir as shown in fig 1c and d the weak characteristic peaks corresponding to the scorodite structured feaso4 2h2o show the pattern of the precipitate obtained in the 6 h reaction fe3o4 remains the main phase the characteristic peaks of unreacted feso4 4h2o are also reveal in the pattern suggesting that some fe2 ions accumulate on the surface of magnetite particles because of its dissolution correspondingly a high arsenic concentration of 4400 mg l remains in the waste acid because of the lack of reaction time for the arsenic precipitation after 12 h of reaction scorodite and magnetite were the main phases in the precipitate while the characteristic peaks of feso4 4h2o were reduced to a very low intensity a high arsenic removal efficiency of 99 90 was achieved and the dissolution of magnetite slowed after 12 h a reaction of 12 h was found to be sufficient for arsenic precipitation and scorodite formation the ftir gives the surface information for the precipitates obtained from the different reaction times as shown in fig 1d in addition to the confirmation of the existence of phase compositions in fig 1c it also provides the evolution of the surface species that can probe the arsenic removal mechanism via the dissolution crystallization mutually improved cycle the stretching vibration bands of as v oh or as v ofe at 822 cm 1 support the existence of the scorodite structure identified by xrd jia et al 2007 the so4 2 stretching vibration band at 1124 cm 1 indicates the presence of feso4 4h2o suggesting sufficient iron sources for the formation and crystallization of feaso4 gomez et al 2011a the absorption peak of crystal water at 1629 cm 1 might be attributed to scorodite and sulfates baghurst et al 1996 gomez et al 2010 correspondingly hydroxyl stretching vibrational absorption peaks of crystal water at 3517 cm 1 and 2988 cm 1 were observed the band from feo at 1384 cm 1 should be derived from the fe3o4 magnetite structure yuan et al 2016 the sem images in fig 2 illustrate the morphological change of the precipitate as a function of reaction time an obvious orthorhombic dipyramidal scorodite crystal was observed in the precipitates the composition of scorodite was further confirmed by eds results the scorodite crystal can be synthesized within a short time of 6 h and grows larger with increasing reaction time only a few submicron scale irregular polyhedrons or sheets are sparsely dispersed on the surface of the magnetite particles fig 2a b and 2c after 6 h of reaction a large amount of unreacted magnetite remains in the precipitate more micron scale octahedrons are densely dispersed on the surface of the magnetite particles with increasing reaction time this morphological change indicates that scorodite grows on the surface of the magnetite because of the surrounding abundant iron ions from the successive dissolution of magnetite a reaction time longer than 12 h slightly affects the morphology of the scorodite crystal this may be due to the large amount of scorodite attached to the surface of the magnetite which prevents the magnetite from continuing to dissolve and release iron ions at the same time the surface of the relatively large scorodite particles is covered by the secondary submicron scorodite due to the lack of arsenic in the aqueous solution the fully covered surface of magnetite might also prevent the formation of larger crystals because the number of attachment points is largely reduced less magnetite dissolves when no more scorodite precipitates because of the lack of arsenic in the residual solution the transformation of the chemical valence states of arsenic and iron in the precipitates are shown in figs 3 and 4 the as 3d spectrum of the precipitate is deconvoluted into two individual peaks derived from as iii and as v that overlap each other according to nesbitt et al 1995 and lim et al 2009 the as 3d5 2 peaks for as iii and as v were set to bind energy ranges of 44 00 45 50 ev and 45 2 46 8 ev respectively as shown in fig 3 the peaks at binding energies of 45 08 44 17 44 68 45 03 ev and 46 00 45 39 45 36 45 54 ev are assigned to as iii and as v respectively the fe2p xps patterns of the precipitates were fitted using the nonlinear method according to mc biesinger et al 2011 as shown in fig 4 the peaks at binding energies of 709 98 709 48 709 48 710 18 ev and 712 38 711 68 712 68 712 28 ev are assigned to fe ii and fe iii respectively the distributions of valence states of arsenic and iron are given in table 3 the peaks assigned to as v in fig 3 and peaks assigned to fe iii in fig 4 gradually increase with the reaction proceeding from 6 to 12 h and then remain relatively stable with increasing reaction time correspondingly the molar ratios of as v as iii and fe iii fe ii first increase with increasing reaction time and then tend to be flat this indicates that the crystallization and growth of scorodite result in an accumulation of as v and fe iii via the dissolution of magnetite the oxidation of fe ii and as iii and the precipitation of as v in the form of amorphous feaso4 in addition both the fe iii fe ii and as v as iii ratios might also be affected by the redox between fe iii and as iii liu et al 2015a after 12 h of reaction the stable distribution of arsenic and iron valence reveals that both arsenic precipitation and magnetite dissolution might proceed at very low reaction rates the arsenic precipitation in the form of feaso4 and the dissolution of feaso4 reaches an equilibrium and no more scorodite forms 3 2 reaction behavior of magnetite in waste acid 3 2 1 effect of predissolution time a room temperature predissolution of magnetite in waste acid was used to introduce an adequate amount of iron into the waste acid to initiate the arsenic precipitation and neutralize the waste acid to a suitable ph range ready for scorodite synthesis after predissolution the acidity of the waste acid is largely reduced and the ph can be lowered to a range from 1 to 2 the solid liquid mixture will be directly transferred to the atmospheric scorodite synthesis with a ph adjustment using naoh or without any treatment a room temperature atmospheric dissolution is preferable from an economic standpoint fig 5 shows that the concentration of arsenic in the waste acid decreases from 10300 mg l to 8144 mg l after the predissolution but decreases slowly with the extension of the dissolution time the iron concentration and ph in the waste acid slowly increase as the predissolution time increases as shown in fig 6 the reacted magnetite has a smaller particle size than the fresh magnetite and the particles become smooth with newly produced white particles adhering to the surface the dissolution of magnetite results in increases in the concentration of iron ions and ph the loss of approximately 2200 mg l of arsenic in the predissolution should be ascribed to the formation of amorphous ferric arsenate at the same time due to the strong adsorption of magnetite powder liu et al 2015a some arsenic ions are adsorbed on the surface of the magnetite as shown in fig 6 which can enhance the arsenic precipitation and the subsequent crystallization of scorodite increasing the dissolution time will not increase the iron ion concentration or ph of the aqueous solution the ph of the waste acid after predissolution is close to 1 2 resulting in a weak driving force of dissolution because of the equilibrium limitation in an h depletive aqueous solution six hours of predissolution of magnetite in waste acid is adequate for the subsequent scorodite synthesis 3 2 2 effect of magnetite dosage the dosage of magnetite affects the initial iron concentration in the waste acid and the initial ph after predissolution the contact surface area between the magnetite and waste acid will also be determined by the dosage of magnetite fig 7 a shows that the arsenic concentration decreases gradually with increasing magnetite dosage while the iron concentration dramatically increases from 154 mg l to 688 mg l followed by an increase of ph from 0 85 to 1 22 this might be because the increase of magnetite dosage enlarges the contact surface area between the magnetite and the reactants h and arsenic in the waste acid providing more iron ions and a higher initial ph which is favorable for arsenic precipitation in the subsequent scorodite synthesis figs 7b 8c and 8 d show that the well crystallized scorodite is synthesized when a suitable amount of magnetite is used a fe3o4 as molar ratio of 1 33 is suitable for arsenic removal and ratios higher than 1 33 have no significant influence on the arsenic removal efficiency because of the weak solubility of magnetite in an aqueous solution with higher ph values often scorodite is synthesized using an ionic iron source at high fe as molar ratios ranging from 3 to 4 this conventional method usually suffers from the poor crystallinity of precipitates due to the coexistence of amorphous ferric arsenate to obtain large sized and well crystallized scorodite the supersaturation of iron and arsenic in the aqueous solution must be avoided by adding seed crystals and controlling the oxidation atmosphere demopoulos et al 1995 fujita et al 2008b 2008c interestingly we found that the scorodite here was synthesized at a very low fe as molar ratio 1 12 in the waste acid using magnetite as an in situ iron source via a mutually improved cycle composed of magnetite dissolution and arsenic precipitation in addition we noticed that both the amorphous ferric arsenate and scorodite crystals grew on the surface of magnetite particles at a very low iron concentration therefore this phenomenon further confirms the reaction pathway i magnetite particles dissolve in the waste acid to release iron ions and neutralize h and magnetite helps to adsorb arsenic and enrich the surface arsenic ions ii the iron ion enriched surface of magnetite is likely to precipitate the surrounding arsenic ions via the formation of amorphous ferric arsenate iii the h generated from ferric arsenate formation will in turn improve the in situ dissolution of magnetite to provide more iron ions for the subsequent arsenic precipitation and iv steps ii and iii alternately or simultaneously occur in a mutually improved mode until the arsenic depletes and a thermodynamic limitation is reached 3 2 3 effect of ph value the scorodite synthesis is very sensitive to the ph in both high pressure and atmospheric reactions using ionic iron sources demopoulos et al 1995 singhania et al 2005 2006 the influence of ph on scorodite synthesis in waste acid using magnetite was investigated in a ph range from 1 2 initial to 4 0 as shown in fig 8 after predissolution some of the waste acid samples with an initial ph of 1 2 are be adjusted to 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 4 0 by naoh solution fig 8a shows that the lowest arsenic concentration of the reacted waste acid was obtained at a ph of 2 fig 8b and c indicate that well crystallized scorodite could be produced at ph values of 1 5 and 2 the lowest leached arsenic concentration of precipitate was obtained at a ph of 2 with the highest removal efficiency of arsenic this result suggests that ph values ranging from 1 5 to 2 are favorable for the formation of amorphous ferric arsenate and the subsequent transformation of amorphous ferric arsenate into scorodite the crystallization of scorodite is derived from the competition between the formation and dissolution of amorphous ferric arsenate in the acid solution langmuir et al 2006 the accumulation of amorphous ferric arsenate in a suitable ph range 1 5 2 is favorable for scorodite crystallization paktunc et al 2008 subsequently the conversion of amorphous arsenate to scorodite can be rapidly completed within 12 h a lower ph 1 5 will accelerate the dissolution of amorphous ferric arsenate while a higher ph 2 will result in the coprecipitation of basic compounds goethite and jarosite and sulfate ferric sulfate inhibiting the crystallization of scorodite moreover higher ph values make it difficult to dissolve magnetite and no more iron ions will be released combined with the ftir of the precipitate of fig 8d all precipitates show a stretching vibration absorption band of as v oh or as v ofe with a wavenumber of 822 cm 1 the strongest vibration absorption band was observed at a ph of 2 the two peaks at 3517 cm 1 and 2988 cm 1 corresponding to the hydroxyl bonds in the water in the crystal were observed in the spectra of precipitates obtained at ph values of 1 5 and 2 it is indicated that amorphous arsenate was formed but not converted into scorodite at initial ph values of 2 5 and 4 3 2 4 effect of reaction temperature the stability of scorodite is a very important indicator for evaluating the efficiency of arsenic immobilization in scorodite the formation of environmentally stable scorodite typically requires temperatures near the boiling point of the solution or higher ke et al 2018 a higher temperature tends to produce more stable and larger scorodite particles with a high arsenic removal efficiency gomez et al 2011b moreover the reaction temperature in our experiment is important for the intensification of the mutually improved cycle composed of magnetite dissolution and arsenic precipitation liu et al 2010 fig 9 shows that increasing the temperature can intensify the kinetics of arsenic precipitation and transformation of amorphous ferric arsenate into scorodite one observation is that the induction period below 90 c leads to the initial nucleation of fresh scorodite at the magnetite surface the leaching arsenic concentration of the poorly crystallized scorodite obtained at 80 c in this induction period reaches 68 mg l at higher temperatures 90 c the induction period was shortened and the well crystallized scorodite could be synthesized following a high arsenic removal efficiency fig 9c this may be attributed to two fundamental reasons a suitable local supersaturation created by the fe enriched surface and controlling a low iron concentration in the surrounding waste acid which facilitates the kinetics of scorodite crystallization the poor crystallinity of the scorodite precursor feaso4 2 x h2o is related to the discovery by dutrizac et al dutrizac and jambor 1988 that the formation of scorodite at low temperatures tends to leave some amorphous material on its surface which increases the apparent solubility of the scorodite evidently when the reaction temperature reaches 90 c we obtained precipitates with well crystallized scorodite structures as shown in fig 9c and d the increase in temperature is not only beneficial to the dissolution of magnetite to release more iron ions but also enhances the kinetics of secondary scorodite nucleation papangelakis and demopoulos 2013 therefore the minimum temperature for scorodite synthesis is considered to be 90 c under the experimental conditions 3 3 prospective process for waste acid treatment using magnetite the results of sections 3 1 and 3 2 were obtained using waste acid with an arsenic concentration of 10 3 g l and a sulfuric acid concentration of 72 5 g l considering the feasibility in the nonferrous industry this technology should be effective for waste acids with changing compositions since the concentrations of two main components arsenic and sulfuric acid in waste acid will fluctuate in large ranges 1 30 g l for arsenic and 20 150 g l for sulfuric acid to further explore the applicability of the waste acid treatment using magnetite the tolerance of arsenic and sulfuric acid concentrations of waste acid in this new proposed technology were investigated the arsenic removal experiments of waste acid with arsenic concentrations ranging from 6 g l to 42 g l and sulfuric acid concentrations ranging from 40 g l to 280 g l were conducted at the optimal conditions obtained in section 3 2 the summary of arsenic removal efficiencies η and the applicable scope of concentrations of arsenic and sulfuric acid are shown in fig 10 magnetite was founded to be effective for the arsenic removal from waste acid at a higher sulfuric acid concentration the waste acid with higher sulfuric acid concentrations is more reactive towards magnetite and donates abundant initial iron ions to initiate arsenic precipitation however magnetite is difficult to dissolve in waste acid with low sulfuric acid concentrations without the plenty of iron ions in the solution the arsenic precipitation cannot continue for the arsenic removal at a high sulfuric acid concentration high arsenic removal efficiencies around 99 can be achieved for the waste acid with arsenic concentrations ranging from 10 g l to 42 g l these results show that magnetite is a highly adaptive reagent for the arsenic removal from waste acid and it can handle the treatment of waste acid with changing compositions to a great extent even only an arsenic removal efficiency of 50 was obtained for the waste acid with low concentrations of arsenic 6 g l and sulfuric acid 40 g l by using the magnetite at the optimal condition obtained in section 3 2 it is believed that the arsenic removal efficiency will be further improved when the magnetite with higher surface areas and more suitable reaction conditions are applied to this type of waste acid based on the abovementioned results we propose a prospective process for waste acid treatment using magnetite as shown in fig 11 the process is composed of the predissolution of magnetite scorodite synthesis solid liquid separation scorodite magnetite magnetic separation high efficiency purification of residual arsenic bearing solution using fresh magnetite and recycling of unreacted magnetite fresh magnetite is added to the waste acid for the room temperature predissolution and atmospheric scorodite synthesis at temperatures of 90 c or higher after the atmospheric reaction most of the arsenic will be removed from the waste acid in the form of scorodite resulting in a residual solution with an arsenic concentration of approximately 10 mg l target concentration and a final ph of approximately 2 0 the obtained environmentally friendly scorodite can be separated from the precipitate by magnetic separation while magnetite can be reused for recycling as a nonhazardous solid waste the arsenic enriched scorodite will be stored in a slag dump equipped with the corresponding leakage resistant waterproofed and loss resistant measures to achieve a high efficiency purification of arsenic in residual waste acid we take advantage of the adsorbability of fresh magnetite to remove the arsenic concentration from approximately 10 mg l to a lower level 0 5 mg l other heavy metals in the residual waste acid will also be simultaneously removed the arsenic adsorbed magnetite can be reused as the raw material the final arsenic free wastewater will be neutralized or purified in the next step to completely remove contaminants acid heavy metals fluorine chloride etc to obtain clean water bakshi et al 2018 tang et al 2017 e g neutralization using lime is a cost effective option in the current industry the proposed process shows high potential for large scale applications for arsenic removal from waste acid using magnetite magnetite is used as an affordable iron source with a very high iron utilization efficiency the arsenic can be effectively removed by magnetite from waste acid without emissions of hazardous solid waste in addition the magnetite predissolution can also partially act as the neutralization reagent 4 conclusions this study demonstrates an environmentally friendly process for the self enhanced and efficient removal of arsenic from waste acid using magnetite as an in situ iron donator magnetite acts as a neutralization reagent and initial iron source during predissolution providing a suitable ph starting iron ions and abundant adsorption sites for the induction of arsenic precipitation and the subsequent crystallization of scorodite the sustainable crystallization of scorodite in the atmospheric reaction is continuously driven by the mutually improved cycle composed of arsenic precipitation and magnetite dissolution on the surface of magnetite particles and the total reaction can be interpreted as 2fe3o4 6h3aso4 h2o2 6feaso4 10h2o well crystallized and environmentally stable scorodite can be synthesized using magnetite because of the low supersaturation of iron ions in the solution allowing the direct and efficient utilization of iron in magnetite for waste acid with an initial arsenic concentration of 10030 mg l and a sulfuric acid concentration of 7250 mg l magnetite can remove 99 90 of the arsenic in the form of scorodite under optimal conditions including a 6 h room temperature predissolution and a 12 h atmospheric reaction at 90 c and a ph of 2 0 with a magnetite dosage at a fe3o4 as molar ratio of 1 33 magnetite also shows favorable adaptability for waste acid with changing compositions

18861,vinyl chloride vc is a common groundwater contaminant and known human carcinogen three major bacterial guilds are known to participate in vc biodegradation aerobic etheneotrophs and methanotrophs and anaerobic organohalide respiring vc dechlorinators we investigated the spatial relationships between functional genes representing these three groups of bacteria as determined by qpcr with chlorinated ethene concentrations in a surficial aquifer at a contaminated site we used cryogenic soil coring to collect high resolution aquifer sediment samples and to preserve sample geochemistry and nucleic acids under field conditions all samples appeared to be anaerobic i e contained little to no dissolved oxygen vc biodegradation associated functional genes from etheneotrophs etnc and or etne methanotrophs mmox and or pmoa and anaerobic vc dechlorinators bvca and or vcra coexisted in 48 of the samples transcripts of etnc etne and bvca vcra were quantified in contemporaneous groundwater samples indicating co located gene expression functional genes from etheneotrophs and anaerobic vc dechlorinators were correlated to vc concentrations in the lower surficial aquifer p 0 05 methanotroph functional genes were not correlated to vc concentrations cryogenic soil coring proved to be a powerful tool for capturing high spatial resolution trends in geochemical and nucleic acid data in aquifer sediments we conclude that both aerobic etheneotrophs and anaerobic vc dechlorinators may play a significant role in vc biodegradation in aquifers that have little dissolved oxygen graphical abstract image 1 keywords vinyl chloride etheneotrophs methanotrophs anaerobic vc dechlorinator cryogenic coring chlorinated solvents aquifer sediments 1 introduction the chlorinated solvents tetrachloroethene pce and trichloroethene tce have wide industrial application primarily as dry cleaning fluids and degreasers watts 1998 poor handling practices historically have resulted in widespread groundwater contamination by these chemicals bradley 2003 moran et al 2007 pce and tce are biodegradable by anaerobic bacteria through reductive dechlorination which generates the toxic intermediates cis dichloroethene cis dce and vinyl chloride vc a known human carcinogen clewell et al 2001 complete dechlorination of vc to environmentally innocuous ethene is mediated by certain obligate organohalide respiring bacteria hereafter collectively referred to as anaerobic vc dechlorinators this includes dehalococcoides mccartyii strains that express the reductive dehalogenase genes bvca or vcra krajmalnik brown et al 2004 müller et al 2004 or the newly discovered dehalogenimonas strain that expresses related dehalogenases yang et al 2017 however despite the presence of these bacteria at contaminated sites reductive dechlorination may frequently stall resulting in the accumulation of cis dce and vc cox 2012 certain aerobic bacteria including ethene oxidizers etheneotrophs and methane oxidizers methanotrophs are also known to effectively degrade vc into non toxic end products coleman et al 2002 davis and carpenter 1990 jin and mattes 2010 verce et al 2000 vc oxidation occurs by co metabolism in which methane or ethene are consumed as primary substrates or through metabolic consumption by some etheneotrophs vc assimilators fogel et al 1986 freedman and herz 1996 jin and mattes 2008 verce et al 2001 methanotrophs and etheneotrophs both express di iron monooxygenases that can catalyze vc oxidation during growth on ethene and vc etheneotrophs express a soluble alkene monooxygenase akmo transforming vc to the epoxide chlorooxirane which is further metabolized to 2 chloro 2 hydroxyethyl com by an epoxyalkane coenzyme m transferase eacomt coleman and spain 2003 the genes etnc and etne encode the α subunit of the akmo and the eacomt respectively and serve as specific biomarkers for etheneotrophs coleman and spain 2003 liu et al 2018 methanotrophs express both soluble and particulate i e membrane bound methane monooxygenases during growth on methane the genes mmox and pmoa encode the α subunits of the soluble and particulate monooxygenases respectively and serve as specific biomarkers for methanotrophs paszczynski et al 2011 both metabolic and co metabolic vc oxidation may be environmentally relevant since methane and ethene are often present in vc plumes findlay et al 2016 liang et al 2017b aerobic vc biodegradation processes can be overlooked because the groundwater plumes where vc occurs are generally considered anaerobic however vc oxidizing bacteria have been isolated from anaerobic groundwater fullerton et al 2014 and laboratory studies have shown that pure cultures of certain etheneotrophs degrade vc at very low oxygen concentrations coleman et al 2002 vc is more mobile than higher chlorinated ethenes and thus has greater potential to migrate away from anaerobic zones and into aerobic or micro aerobic regions of a groundwater plume microcosm studies have demonstrated continued vc oxidation at oxygen concentrations below the detection limit of most field oxygen probes 0 2 mg l when a known low oxygen flux was provided gossett 2010 it has been suggested that aerobic microorganisms are active in groundwater plumes that would be deemed anaerobic by most field measurements gossett 2010 a recent study of functional gene expression by etheneotrophs methanotrophs and anaerobic vc dechlorinators in 95 groundwater samples collected from monitoring wells across six chlorinated ethene contaminated sites found that etheneotrophs and methanotrophs were present in all of the samples liang et al 2017b in addition mrna transcripts of these functional genes were measured which indicated that these organisms were active in the majority 66 86 of the samples even where the groundwater appeared anaerobic liang et al 2017b surprisingly these biomarkers often coincided with biomarkers for the anaerobic dehalococcoides liang et al 2017b which are considered to be very sensitive to oxygen amos et al 2008 finding both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the same groundwater sample is unexpected and leaves uncertainty about the source of these genes groundwater samples from typical monitoring wells are inherently composited from an undefined volume with potentially different biogeochemical conditions surrounding the well screen multilevel sampler data from a well characterized site has shown that chlorinated ethene concentrations can vary by orders of magnitude within 1 m vertically i e normal to groundwater flow and that heterogeneity may contribute significantly to this variability near source areas mcmillan et al 2018 rivett et al 2014 comparison of multilevel sampler data with adjacent conventional monitoring wells shows that the monitoring well data is biased towards high permeability zones mcmillan et al 2018 aquifer core samples can provide discrete data from known locations within a plume but can be difficult to retrieve under field conditions kiaalhosseini et al 2016 in addition biomarker and chemical data may be sensitive to environmental changes i e changes in saturation or redox potential that occur during drilling and sample retrieval kiaalhosseini et al 2016 a newly developed cryogenic sampling technique freezes samples in situ thus preserving biomarkers and chemical analytes under field conditions kiaalhosseini et al 2016 allowing for the analysis of biomarkers and chemical data in the subsurface at a high spatial resolution the primary goal of this study is to use cryogenic coring to demonstrate the distribution of contaminants and vc biodegradation biomarker genes under very high resolution conditions where geochemical conditions are rigorously preserved due to in situ cryogenic freezing applying qpcr methods to these samples we determined the distribution of functional genes from aerobic vc oxidizers i e methanotrophs and etheneotrophs and anaerobic vc dechlorinating bacteria within the aquifer at fine spatial resolution we also measured geochemical parameters at this fine resolution to explore relationships between the abundance of vc degrading bacterial functional genes and geochemical conditions in the samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description mcrd parris island is a military training site located along the southern coast of south carolina at mcrd parris island there is a former dry cleaning facility known as site 45 experienced multiple pce spills in the 1990s churchill 2012 vroblesky et al 2009 prior investigations at the site have delineated the contaminant plumes and found evidence of significant pce biodegradation including the generation of vc and other dechlorination intermediates churchill 2012 vroblesky et al 2009 several remediation pilot studies have been performed at the site including one using emulsified zero valent iron in the northern

sterivex gp filters pore size 0 22 μm millipore germany for duplicate dna and rna extractions up to 1 l for dna extraction and up to 3 l for rna extraction four soil cores were collected along a transect parallel to the groundwater flow starting in the source area fig 1 soil cores were collected using a hollow stem auger modified for in situ cryogenic freezing with liquid nitrogen as previously described kiaalhosseini et al 2016 frozen aquifer sediment cores were collected in sections of approximately 1 2 m to a maximum depth of 5 5 m below ground surface bgs each section was returned to the surface and subdivided top soil 0 0 6 m bgs was discarded and a miter saw was used to cut a 2 5 cm thick section every 15 cm in core depth resulting in approximately 35 samples per

regression censored regression was performed with the function censreg henningsen 2017 in the censreg package in r overall data structure and aic scores were taken into consideration when choosing the most appropriate model for statistical analyses the non parametric wilcoxon signed rank test was used to make comparisons among different gene abundances 3 results 3 1 stratigraphy visual observation of the soil samples shows distinct soil layers that are horizontally continuous each core consists primarily of an upper silty layer extending from the top of the cores to approximately 3 4 3 7 m and a lower sandy layer extending to 5 7 m bgs fig s4 these layers were previously characterized as the upper and lower surficial aquifers churchill 2012 vroblesky et al 2009 although there is no low permeability zone separating these layers the bottom of the aquifer is bounded by layers of peat and clay of variable thickness which was previously identified as a confining unit churchill 2012 3 2 distribution of chlorinated ethenes and ethene with depth the distribution of chlorinated ethenes and ethene in core samples was analyzed to identify regions of the aquifer where vc may be generated vc concentrations in core 1 in the source area steadily increased from 0 66 to 2 2 m bgs forming a large bifurcated peak between 2 2 and 2 6 m bgs then rapidly dropped off by 3 1 m bgs fig 2 a second peak in vc occurred between 5 5 and 5 8 m bgs immediately above the confining layer vc concentrations in the other cores which are located down gradient of the source area were much lower 1 mg kg than

areas with elevated cis dce fig 2 in cores 1 3 the spikes in vc were concurrent with spikes in cis dce but had a narrower vertical distribution in core 4 the spike in vc was flanked by regions of elevated cis dce but coincided with a steep drop in cis dce concentrations of trans dce and 1 1 dce were below detection in all samples the region with the highest vc fig 2 occurred just below the location with the highest pce and tce concentrations 25 000 and 530 mg kg respectively fig 2 spikes in pce and tce near the bottom of cores 2 4 did not have corresponding spikes in vc in cores 1 and 3 peaks in ethene were also coincident with spikes in vc fig 2 core 3 had an additional region of elevated ethene between 0 66 and 2 1 m bgs in the absence of vc cores 2 and 4 had little or no ethene csia was only performed on samples from core 1 to assess the possibility that chlorinated ethenes had been subject to degradation processes the measured δ13c values for pce were 28 table 1 within the range of newly manufactured pce hunkeler et al 2009 while δ13c values for both tce and cis dce were higher than for pce the samples collected at 0 94 m had a vc δ13c of 24 higher than for cis dce 27

detected in samples between 0 66 and 1 0 m bgs and remained near zero throughout the upper surficial aquifer fig 3 sulfate concentrations then rebound in the lower surficial aquifer steadily increasing between 3 7 and 4 9 m bgs ferrous iron steadily increases between 0 97 and 2 2 m bgs then briefly spikes to 73 mg kg between 2 5 and 2 8 m bgs before decreasing sharply at 3 1 m bgs fig 3 ferrous iron concentrations remain relatively low 5 mg kg for the remainder of the lower surficial aquifer except for a small spike 8 6 mg kg at 5 5 m bgs methane concentrations were low throughout core 1 but were generally higher in the lower surficial aquifer 8 5 mg kg than in the upper surficial aquifer 2 6 mg kg fig 3 in core 2 sulfate was detected in all samples but the concentration had a minimum of 5 mg kg between 1 1 and 1 3 m bgs in core 2 ferrous iron peaked between 1 6 and 2 8 m bgs with a maximum of 17 mg kg sulfate was detected throughout cores 3 and 4 ferrous iron was 1 mg l throughout cores 3 and 4 3 4 total organic carbon toc chloride and ph values with depth in cores core 1 had very high toc concentrations 55 410 mg kg which trended higher with depth fig s5 this is likely a residual from a pilot study in which emulsified zero valent iron zvi which contained emulsified vegetable oil was injected nearby su et al 2012 toc concentrations in cores 2 4 were generally lower than in core 1 the very high toc concentration 30 000 mg kg seen at 4 9 m bgs in core 4 is likely a contribution of the peat observed near the confining layer fig s4 chloride concentrations fig s5 followed trends similar to the chlorinated ethenes fig 2 the highest concentration of chloride 300 mg kg was observed between 0 66 and 3 1 m bgs in core 1 as with the chlorinated ethenes a second peak in chloride was seen between 4 9 and 5 5 m bgs ph values generally varied between 5 and 7 su with no apparent trends between cores or with depth fig s6 a small number of samples six out of 28

decreased with depth to 1 3 1 9 m bgs then either remained steady or rebounded in the lower surficial aquifer 3 1 m bgs fig 4 methanotroph functional genes were detected in 67 mmox and 46 pmoa of the soil samples methanotroph and etheneotroph functional gene abundance were positively correlated spearman s correlation p 0 05 the abundance of mmox and pmoa was less than etnc and etne in all cores

and spearman s correlation to assess the relationships between functional genes and geochemical parameters censored regression was performed to handle the frequent non detect values present in the functional gene abundance datasets simple linear regression and spearman s correlation was used for comparison with censored regression the results of all three methods were generally similar yet differences were noted in some cases tables s5 s11 statistical analyses were performed separately on data from the upper and lower surficial aquifers considering their different geology and

biodegradation cryo coring was successful in capturing data trends that reveal steep biogeochemical gradients and pockets of microbial activity that would not be evident from typical monitoring well groundwater samples our data show that this site has complicated and variable geochemical environments which are likely governed by the site hydrogeology high spatial resolution trends in geochemistry and biomarkers were evident in each of the cores but the connections between the cores were more difficult to interpret the highest pce and tce contamination was at the upper surficial aquifer of core 1 which was the closest to the source zone fig 2 farther along the soil core transect pce concentrations decreased while tce cis dce and vc accumulated in further and deeper parts of the aquifer fig 2 these trends could suggest chlorinated ethene dechlorination was occurring along the movement of the plumes but could also indicate that the sampling transect was not along the centerline of the chlorinated ethene plume comparison with historical data vroblesky et al 2009 suggests our sampling transect was parallel to the plume but was possibly off centerline as evidenced by the difference in chloride values in core 3 samples as compared to the other cores groundwater contours also curve near the end of our transect as a result of groundwater entering a collapsed storm drain further complicating our understanding of plume movement in the groundwater vroblesky et al 2009 vertical concentration profiles in the cores showed clear evidence of biodegradation in the vicinity of the source area the large bifurcated vc peak between 2 2 and 3 0 m observed in core 1 which coincided with an ethene peak provides further evidence of complete dechlorination of pce to ethene at this site this is despite relatively low ph across most of the site particularly in core 1 between 0 97 and 3 4 m bgs where the ph ranges between 4 4 and 5 9 su fig s6 this is well below the ph range for dechlorination by known dehalococcoides sp ph 6 8 su löffler et al 2013 in addition csia data from core 1 showed pce had more negative δ13c values than for tce cis dce and vc providing a second line of evidence that anaerobic reductive dechlorination was occurring table 1 terminal electron acceptor concentrations showed clear differences in the redox conditions between the upper and lower regions of the surficial aquifer sulfate and iron reduction were evident in the upper surficial aquifer in cores 1 and 2 the lower surficial aquifer did not show signs of iron or sulfate reduction this suggests that the groundwater in the lower surficial aquifer did not transit the upper surficial aquifer but rather recharged from a distant location although no impermeable layer separates the upper and lower surficial aquifer there were large differences in observed chemical and hydrological characteristics neither oxygen nor nitrate were detected in any samples indicating oxygen limiting conditions throughout the aquifer 4 2 abundance and distribution of biomarkers geochemical and csia data alone in the core samples could not differentiate between aerobic and anaerobic vc biodegradation processes however the potential for in situ aerobic vc degradation in soil samples from site 45 is demonstrated by estimating the abundance of related functional genes and transcripts i e etnc etne mmox and pmoa using qpcr techniques we also estimated the abundance of anaerobic vc reductive dehalogenases this is the first field study to investigate the distribution of three vc degrading bacterial guilds at high spatial resolution through the use of cryogenic soil coring etheneotrophs and anaerobic vc dechlorinators were present throughout the site and were found to coexist in 55 of soil samples specifically functional genes from etheneotrophs and vc dechlorinators were at similar abundance 103 105 copies g soil in samples from core 1 2 2 2 5 m bgs 3 7 4 9 m bgs and core 4 3 7 5 4 m bgs which were predominantly anaerobic the overlapping distributions of aerobic etheneotrophs and anaerobic vc dechlorinators suggests the presence of aerobic and anaerobic microenvironments or temporal changes in aquifer geochemistry that allow these microorganisms to coexist in very close spatial proximity within 0 25 g of unhomogenized soil the high spatial resolution of our soil sample analysis confirmed previous reports of the co existence and expression of functional genes from aerobic and anaerobic vc degrading bacteria in anoxic groundwater samples liang et al 2017a 2017b and demonstrates that their simultaneous detection is not an artifact of groundwater sampling techniques this is an important finding as previous reports of the overlapping presence of etheneotrophs and anaerobic vc dechlorinator functional genes in situ relied on groundwater sampling liang et al 2017a 2017b the use of cryogenic coring is the best possible way to prevent fluids distribution during sample recovery and as a consequence our data represent the most compelling demonstration to date that aerobic and anaerobic vc degradation bacterial groups coexist in small sediment samples the presence of functional genes from etheneotrophs and anaerobic vc dechlorinators in anaerobic portions of the aquifer does not necessarily indicate that these microorganisms were active unfortunately rna extraction from soil samples 5 g was unsuccessful likely as a result of low biomass in the samples average dna concentrations 209 ng g soil and the instability of rna during extraction however etheneotroph and vc dechlorinator functional gene transcripts were detected in nearby contemporaneous groundwater samples by virtue of much larger sample size 3 l groundwater taken together the presence of etheneotroph functional genes and vc reductive dehalogenase genes in soil and transcripts of these genes in adjacent groundwater suggest that both aerobic and anaerobic vc degrading bacteria were both present and active throughout the aquifer 4 3 correlations between biomarkers and geochemical conditions etheneotroph functional genes were only correlated to vc concentrations in the lower surficial aquifer etheneotrophs can oxidize vc via co metabolism with ethene as the primary growth substrate freedman and herz 1996 and some etheneotrophs use vc as sole carbon source under laboratory conditions jin and mattes 2008 vc and ethene concentrations both showed positive relationships with etnc and etne abundances in the lower surficial aquifer this further supports similar relationships noted in groundwater samples liang et al 2017b and suggests that both vc and ethene supported the growth of etheneotrophs in portions of the lower surficial aquifer the absence of associations of etheneotroph functional genes with vc in the upper surficial aquifer could be explained by etheneotrophs being more strongly influenced by other factors such as do levels which decreased with depth from the unsaturated zone lee et al 2015 noll et al 2005 although oxygen in all soil samples were below detection limit 0 13 mg l sulfate was abundant at the top of the cores and declined with depth suggesting that a more favorable terminal electron acceptor was available in shallow portions of the core possibly a low level flux oxygen that went undetected in the lower surficial aquifer vertical oxygen flux would not be expected and terminal electron accepting conditions may be relatively constant allowing the influence of vc concentrations on etheneotrophs to be revealed the positive relationship between vc concentrations and vc reductive dehalogenase gene abundances in the lower surficial aquifer could be explained by anaerobic vc dechlorinators using vc as electron acceptor he et al 2003 among the two vc reductive dehalogenase genes bvca was generally more abundant than vcra this observation is consistent with previous studies where both genes were tracked in microcosms and at a contaminated site atashgahi et al 2013 lee et al 2008 only bvca was correlated to vc concentrations in the upper surficial aquifer samples the lack of correlation between vcra and vc in the upper surficial aquifer could be explained in part to ph in this region of the site being well below the optimum for dehalococcoides 6 8 su löffler et al 2013 a previous study which suggests that anaerobic vc dechlorinators employ bvca for growth on vc in less reducing conditions van der zaan et al 2010 however high toc concentrations apparent sulfate depletion with depth and the presence of ferrous iron indicate relatively strong reducing conditions in the upper surficial aquifer samples the positive association between toc and total bacteria and vc degrading bacteria indicate toc most likely derived from previous emulsified zvi injections supported overall bacterial growth at site 45 vc oxidizing bacteria and their functional genes have previously been observed in oxygen limited subsurface environments and in microcosms containing material collected from such environments fullerton et al 2014 gossett 2010 liang et al 2017b extensive searches have failed to reveal any organism capable of vc oxidation with an electron acceptor other than oxygen freedman et al 2013 several vc oxidizing isolates display very low oxygen half velocity constants 0 07 0 3 mg l coleman et al 2002 and thus the ability to scavenge oxygen under very low do conditions it has been suggested that the systems where anaerobic vc oxidation was reported were not truly anaerobic but experienced a cryptic low level oxygen flux freedman et al 2013 gossett 2010 indeed sustained vc oxidation at do levels below 0 02 mg l have has been demonstrated in microcosms provided with a low level do flux gossett 2010 this suggests that vc oxidizing bacteria can exist at the interface of strongly anaerobic subsurface regions the significant heterogeneity observed at some contaminated sites suggest that very low do zones are intermingled with truly anaerobic zones allowing for very close proximity of aerobic and anaerobic vc degrading bacteria the possibility that low level do fluxes can occur at depth in contaminated aquifers and sustain aerobic bacterial populations warrants further study in contrast to functional genes from etheneotrophs and anaerobic vc dechlorinators methanotroph functional genes were not correlated with vc concentrations in either the upper or lower surficial aquifer samples this is consistent with previously reported groundwater data liang et al 2017b and we suspect this is related to the fact that methanotrophs only co metabolize vc overall methanotroph functional genes were of relatively low abundance at site 45 as compared to a previous study of groundwater samples from a dilute vc plume liang et al 2017a suggesting that vc co metabolism by methanotrophs was not a major pathway for vc attenuation the negative correlations between methane and methanotroph functional genes in the upper surficial aquifer could be explained by aerobic growth of methanotrophs at the expense of methane the absence of correlations of mmox and the weak correlations of pmoa with methane in the lower surficial aquifer suggest that geochemical conditions in the lower surficial aquifer were not ideal for growth of methanotrophs associations between cis dce concentrations and vc biodegradation functional genes were similar to those seen with vc concentrations these positive associations could be present because cis dce is the parent compound of vc and that cis dce is used as an electron acceptor by vc dechlorinators carrying bvca and or vcra löffler et al 2013 the associations between pce and tce concentrations and vc biodegradation functional genes differed from those seen with cis dce and vc concentrations i e they were associated with etheneotroph functional genes but not vc reductive dehalogenases in both the upper and lower surficial aquifers similar correlations were observed previously with monitoring well groundwater samples liang et al 2017b 4 4 conclusions cryogenic coring can capture higher spatial resolution samples than would be possible with monitoring wells and is effective for capturing high resolution trends in biomarker and geochemical data cryogenic coring eliminates fluids re distribution during sampling and thus provides the best available evidence for coexistence of functional genes from aerobic and anaerobic vc degrading bacterial guilds functional genes from aerobic vc degrading bacteria both etheneotrophs and methanotrophs are present and widely distributed in an apparently anaerobic aquifer improved methods for isolating rna from environmental samples are necessary in order to quantify biological activity in the subsurface at a comparable spatial resolution an improved understanding of aerobic vc degradation under low do concentrations and low oxygen flux conditions would be useful in designing and implementing natural attenuation or aerobic bioremediation strategies for site cleanup acknowledgements the work was

18861,vinyl chloride vc is a common groundwater contaminant and known human carcinogen three major bacterial guilds are known to participate in vc biodegradation aerobic etheneotrophs and methanotrophs and anaerobic organohalide respiring vc dechlorinators we investigated the spatial relationships between functional genes representing these three groups of bacteria as determined by qpcr with chlorinated ethene concentrations in a surficial aquifer at a contaminated site we used cryogenic soil coring to collect high resolution aquifer sediment samples and to preserve sample geochemistry and nucleic acids under field conditions all samples appeared to be anaerobic i e contained little to no dissolved oxygen vc biodegradation associated functional genes from etheneotrophs etnc and or etne methanotrophs mmox and or pmoa and anaerobic vc dechlorinators bvca and or vcra coexisted in 48 of the samples transcripts of etnc etne and bvca vcra were quantified in contemporaneous groundwater samples indicating co located gene expression functional genes from etheneotrophs and anaerobic vc dechlorinators were correlated to vc concentrations in the lower surficial aquifer p 0 05 methanotroph functional genes were not correlated to vc concentrations cryogenic soil coring proved to be a powerful tool for capturing high spatial resolution trends in geochemical and nucleic acid data in aquifer sediments we conclude that both aerobic etheneotrophs and anaerobic vc dechlorinators may play a significant role in vc biodegradation in aquifers that have little dissolved oxygen graphical abstract image 1 keywords vinyl chloride etheneotrophs methanotrophs anaerobic vc dechlorinator cryogenic coring chlorinated solvents aquifer sediments 1 introduction the chlorinated solvents tetrachloroethene pce and trichloroethene tce have wide industrial application primarily as dry cleaning fluids and degreasers watts 1998 poor handling practices historically have resulted in widespread groundwater contamination by these chemicals bradley 2003 moran et al 2007 pce and tce are biodegradable by anaerobic bacteria through reductive dechlorination which generates the toxic intermediates cis dichloroethene cis dce and vinyl chloride vc a known human carcinogen clewell et al 2001 complete dechlorination of vc to environmentally innocuous ethene is mediated by certain obligate organohalide respiring bacteria hereafter collectively referred to as anaerobic vc dechlorinators this includes dehalococcoides mccartyii strains that express the reductive dehalogenase genes bvca or vcra krajmalnik brown et al 2004 müller et al 2004 or the newly discovered dehalogenimonas strain that expresses related dehalogenases yang et al 2017 however despite the presence of these bacteria at contaminated sites reductive dechlorination may frequently stall resulting in the accumulation of cis dce and vc cox 2012 certain aerobic bacteria including ethene oxidizers etheneotrophs and methane oxidizers methanotrophs are also known to effectively degrade vc into non toxic end products coleman et al 2002 davis and carpenter 1990 jin and mattes 2010 verce et al 2000 vc oxidation occurs by co metabolism in which methane or ethene are consumed as primary substrates or through metabolic consumption by some etheneotrophs vc assimilators fogel et al 1986 freedman and herz 1996 jin and mattes 2008 verce et al 2001 methanotrophs and etheneotrophs both express di iron monooxygenases that can catalyze vc oxidation during growth on ethene and vc etheneotrophs express a soluble alkene monooxygenase akmo transforming vc to the epoxide chlorooxirane which is further metabolized to 2 chloro 2 hydroxyethyl com by an epoxyalkane coenzyme m transferase eacomt coleman and spain 2003 the genes etnc and etne encode the α subunit of the akmo and the eacomt respectively and serve as specific biomarkers for etheneotrophs coleman and spain 2003 liu et al 2018 methanotrophs express both soluble and particulate i e membrane bound methane monooxygenases during growth on methane the genes mmox and pmoa encode the α subunits of the soluble and particulate monooxygenases respectively and serve as specific biomarkers for methanotrophs paszczynski et al 2011 both metabolic and co metabolic vc oxidation may be environmentally relevant since methane and ethene are often present in vc plumes findlay et al 2016 liang et al 2017b aerobic vc biodegradation processes can be overlooked because the groundwater plumes where vc occurs are generally considered anaerobic however vc oxidizing bacteria have been isolated from anaerobic groundwater fullerton et al 2014 and laboratory studies have shown that pure cultures of certain etheneotrophs degrade vc at very low oxygen concentrations coleman et al 2002 vc is more mobile than higher chlorinated ethenes and thus has greater potential to migrate away from anaerobic zones and into aerobic or micro aerobic regions of a groundwater plume microcosm studies have demonstrated continued vc oxidation at oxygen concentrations below the detection limit of most field oxygen probes 0 2 mg l when a known low oxygen flux was provided gossett 2010 it has been suggested that aerobic microorganisms are active in groundwater plumes that would be deemed anaerobic by most field measurements gossett 2010 a recent study of functional gene expression by etheneotrophs methanotrophs and anaerobic vc dechlorinators in 95 groundwater samples collected from monitoring wells across six chlorinated ethene contaminated sites found that etheneotrophs and methanotrophs were present in all of the samples liang et al 2017b in addition mrna transcripts of these functional genes were measured which indicated that these organisms were active in the majority 66 86 of the samples even where the groundwater appeared anaerobic liang et al 2017b surprisingly these biomarkers often coincided with biomarkers for the anaerobic dehalococcoides liang et al 2017b which are considered to be very sensitive to oxygen amos et al 2008 finding both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the same groundwater sample is unexpected and leaves uncertainty about the source of these genes groundwater samples from typical monitoring wells are inherently composited from an undefined volume with potentially different biogeochemical conditions surrounding the well screen multilevel sampler data from a well characterized site has shown that chlorinated ethene concentrations can vary by orders of magnitude within 1 m vertically i e normal to groundwater flow and that heterogeneity may contribute significantly to this variability near source areas mcmillan et al 2018 rivett et al 2014 comparison of multilevel sampler data with adjacent conventional monitoring wells shows that the monitoring well data is biased towards high permeability zones mcmillan et al 2018 aquifer core samples can provide discrete data from known locations within a plume but can be difficult to retrieve under field conditions kiaalhosseini et al 2016 in addition biomarker and chemical data may be sensitive to environmental changes i e changes in saturation or redox potential that occur during drilling and sample retrieval kiaalhosseini et al 2016 a newly developed cryogenic sampling technique freezes samples in situ thus preserving biomarkers and chemical analytes under field conditions kiaalhosseini et al 2016 allowing for the analysis of biomarkers and chemical data in the subsurface at a high spatial resolution the primary goal of this study is to use cryogenic coring to demonstrate the distribution of contaminants and vc biodegradation biomarker genes under very high resolution conditions where geochemical conditions are rigorously preserved due to in situ cryogenic freezing applying qpcr methods to these samples we determined the distribution of functional genes from aerobic vc oxidizers i e methanotrophs and etheneotrophs and anaerobic vc dechlorinating bacteria within the aquifer at fine spatial resolution we also measured geochemical parameters at this fine resolution to explore relationships between the abundance of vc degrading bacterial functional genes and geochemical conditions in the samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description mcrd parris island is a military training site located along the southern coast of south carolina at mcrd parris island there is a former dry cleaning facility known as site 45 experienced multiple pce spills in the 1990s churchill 2012 vroblesky et al 2009 prior investigations at the site have delineated the contaminant plumes and found evidence of significant pce biodegradation including the generation of vc and other dechlorination intermediates churchill 2012 vroblesky et al 2009 several remediation pilot studies have been performed at the site including one using emulsified zero valent iron in the northern plume source area su et al 2012 2 2 groundwater and cryo core collection procedures soil and groundwater samples were collected from the site in june 2016 groundwater samples were collected using a previously described low flow procedure liang et al 2017b typical groundwater parameters were measured in the field during sample collection liang et al 2017b groundwater samples were passed through sterivex gp filters pore size 0 22 μm millipore germany for duplicate dna and rna extractions up to 1 l for dna extraction and up to 3 l for rna extraction four soil cores were collected along a transect parallel to the groundwater flow starting in the source area fig 1 soil cores were collected using a hollow stem auger modified for in situ cryogenic freezing with liquid nitrogen as previously described kiaalhosseini et al 2016 frozen aquifer sediment cores were collected in sections of approximately 1 2 m to a maximum depth of 5 5 m below ground surface bgs each section was returned to the surface and subdivided top soil 0 0 6 m bgs was discarded and a miter saw was used to cut a 2 5 cm thick section every 15 cm in core depth resulting in approximately 35 samples per core some of the sections had incomplete recovery because of blockages and soil loss from the bottom of the cores during retrieval a total of 124 samples were collected the samples were wrapped in aluminum foil sealed in plastic bags and shipped to the laboratory on dry ice samples were stored at 80 c until analyzed 2 3 cryo core sample processing frozen soil samples were processed based on previously described methods olson et al 2017 sale et al 2015 each sample was split into quarter sections using a hammer and masonry chisel and subjected to extraction procedures for chemicals and nucleic acids described below no appreciable thawing was noted during sample processing all tools and surfaces were disinfected with 70 ethanol between samples samples were visually inspected during processing and physical characteristics of the soil were noted 2 4 chemical extraction aqueous extracts were prepared for geochemical analysis detailed below by filling pre weighed 4 oz 140 ml septa

jars and the overflow were recorded and used to determine soil mass the remaining water volume was also determined and used to calculate analyte concentrations in the soil methanol extracts were also prepared for chlorinated ethene analysis soil samples were expected to have variable organic matter content which may have resulted in differential partitioning of chlorinated ethenes between samples extraction in organic solvent methanol was used to enable better recovery of analytes methanol extracts were prepared by adding 20 ml of hplc grade methanol sigma aldrich st louis mo to 2 oz 60 ml septa jars frozen soil was added and the jars were reweighed to determine the soil mass aqueous and methanol extracts were gently mixed and stored at 4 c for four days prior to analysis according to

of the soil samples shows distinct soil layers that are horizontally continuous each core consists primarily of an upper silty layer extending from the top of the cores to approximately 3 4 3 7 m and a lower sandy layer extending to 5 7 m bgs fig s4 these layers were previously characterized as the upper and lower surficial aquifers churchill 2012 vroblesky et al 2009 although there is no low permeability zone separating these layers the bottom of the aquifer is bounded by layers of peat and clay of variable thickness which was previously identified as a confining unit churchill 2012 3 2 distribution of chlorinated ethenes and ethene with depth the distribution of chlorinated ethenes and ethene in core samples was analyzed to identify regions of the aquifer where vc may be generated vc concentrations in core 1 in the source area steadily increased from 0 66 to 2 2 m bgs forming a large bifurcated peak between 2 2 and 2 6 m bgs then rapidly dropped off by 3 1 m bgs fig 2 a second peak in vc occurred between 5 5 and 5 8 m bgs immediately above the confining layer vc concentrations in the other cores which are located down gradient of the source area were much lower 1 mg kg than in core 1 cores 2 3 each had a single peak in vc between approximately 2 8 3 7 m bgs core 4 also had a single peak 3 7 4 6 m bgs each of the regions with elevated vc concentrations was found near areas with elevated cis dce fig 2 in cores 1 3 the spikes in vc were concurrent with spikes in cis dce but had a narrower vertical distribution in core 4 the spike in vc was flanked by regions of elevated cis dce but coincided with a steep drop in cis dce concentrations of trans dce and 1 1 dce were below detection in all samples the region with the highest vc fig 2 occurred just below the location with the highest pce and tce concentrations 25 000 and 530 mg kg respectively fig 2 spikes in pce and tce near the bottom of cores 2 4 did not have corresponding spikes in vc in cores 1 and 3 peaks in ethene were also coincident with spikes in vc fig 2 core 3 had an additional region of elevated ethene between 0 66 and 2 1 m bgs in the absence of vc cores 2 and 4 had little or no ethene csia was only performed on samples from core 1 to assess the possibility that chlorinated ethenes had been subject to degradation processes the measured δ13c values for pce were 28 table 1 within the range of newly manufactured pce hunkeler et al 2009 while δ13c values for both tce and cis dce were higher than for pce the samples collected at 0 94 m had a vc δ13c of 24 higher than for cis dce 27 in the same sample the increasing δ13c values measured for the lower chlorinated ethenes vc and c is dce is indicative of degradation processes e g biodegradation and or abiotic reactions catalyzed by zvi 3 3 terminal electron acceptors with depth dissolved oxygen do and nitrate concentrations were below detection see detection limits table s1 in all samples data not shown in core 1 sulfate was not detected in samples between 0 66 and 1 0 m bgs and remained near zero throughout the upper surficial aquifer fig 3 sulfate concentrations then rebound in the lower surficial aquifer steadily increasing between 3 7 and 4 9 m bgs ferrous iron steadily increases between 0 97 and 2 2 m bgs then briefly spikes to 73 mg kg between 2 5 and 2 8 m bgs before decreasing sharply at 3 1 m bgs fig 3 ferrous iron concentrations remain relatively low 5 mg kg for the remainder of the lower surficial aquifer except for a small spike 8 6 mg kg at 5 5 m bgs methane concentrations were low throughout core 1 but were generally higher in the lower surficial aquifer 8 5 mg kg than in the upper surficial aquifer 2 6 mg kg fig 3 in core 2 sulfate was detected in all samples but the concentration had a minimum of 5 mg kg between 1 1 and 1 3 m bgs in core 2 ferrous iron peaked between 1 6 and 2 8 m bgs with a maximum of 17 mg kg sulfate was detected throughout cores 3 and 4 ferrous iron was 1 mg l throughout cores 3 and 4 3 4 total organic carbon toc chloride and ph values with depth in cores core 1 had very high toc concentrations 55 410 mg kg which trended higher with depth fig s5 this is likely a residual from a pilot study in which emulsified zero valent iron zvi which contained emulsified vegetable oil was injected nearby su et al 2012 toc concentrations in cores 2 4 were generally lower than in core 1 the very high toc concentration 30 000 mg kg seen at 4 9 m bgs in core 4 is likely a contribution of the peat observed near the confining layer fig s4 chloride concentrations fig s5 followed trends similar to the chlorinated ethenes fig 2 the highest concentration of chloride 300 mg kg was observed between 0 66 and 3 1 m bgs in core 1 as with the chlorinated ethenes a second peak in chloride was seen between 4 9 and 5 5 m bgs ph values generally varied between 5 and 7 su with no apparent trends between cores or with depth fig s6 a small number of samples six out of 28 samples from core 1 mostly between 4 0 and 4 9 m bgs in core 1had an elevated ph 8 7 11 su ethane and acetylene were below detection in all samples 15 ppmv 3 5 abundance of total 16s rrna genes and

decreased with depth to 1 3 1 9 m bgs then either remained steady or rebounded in the lower surficial aquifer 3 1 m bgs fig 4 methanotroph functional genes were detected in 67 mmox and 46 pmoa of the soil samples methanotroph and etheneotroph functional gene abundance were positively correlated spearman s correlation p 0 05 the abundance of mmox and pmoa was less than etnc and etne in all cores wilcoxon signed rank test p 0 05 the highest methanotroph functional gene abundances were found near the ground surface and decreased with depth to 1 3 1 9 m bgs before rebounding in the lower surficial aquifer fig 4 vc reductive dehalogenase genes were detected in 53 bvca and 33 vcra of the soil samples with averaging 1 2 105 and 1 2 104 copies g soil respectively these reductive dehalogenase genes were detected in 59 of the soil samples vc reductive dehalogenase functional genes were generally less abundant than those for etheneotrophs wilcoxon signed rank test p 0 05 among the two reductive vc dehalogenase genes bvca was more abundant overall than vcra wilcoxon signed rank test p 0 05 although vcra and bvca abundance were similar in core 1 4 6 5 0 m and core 4 3 7 5 4 m coexistence of functional genes associated with aerobic and anaerobic vc biodegradation was commonly observed in the core samples etheneotroph functional genes etnc and or etne methanotroph functional genes mmox and or pmoa and vc reductive dehalogenase genes bvca and or vcra coexisted in 48 of the samples while etheneotroph functional genes and vc reductive dehalogenase genes coexisted in 55 of the samples the coexistence of etheneotroph and vc reductive dehalogenase genes was also confirmed by their positive correlation spearman s correlation p 0 001 fig s8 rna extraction was not successful for the aquifer sediment samples 5 g however groundwater samples collected from monitoring wells within the contaminant plume contained abundant etheneotroph and vc dechlorinator functional gene transcripts 108 copies l fig s9 transcripts of bvca were relatively more abundant in the wells near the source area ml 2 and pmw 4 while vcra etnc and etne were present at a similar abundance in ml 2 and vcra is much less abundant in pmw 4 the upper surficial aquifer in the well farthest from the source area ml 07 su had the lowest concentration of all the functional gene transcripts with etnc etne and vcra all below detection the lower surficial aquifer well in this location ml 07 sl contained both etheneotroph and vc dechlorinator functional gene transcripts at concentrations similar to the up gradient wells 3 6 relationships between functional genes and site geochemical parameters in cryo core samples we used different statistical methods censored regression simple linear regression and spearman s correlation to assess the relationships between functional genes and geochemical parameters censored regression was performed to handle the frequent non detect values present in the functional gene abundance datasets simple linear regression and spearman s correlation was used for comparison with censored regression the results of all three methods were generally similar yet differences were noted in some cases tables s5 s11 statistical analyses were performed separately on data from the upper and lower surficial aquifers considering their different geology and

genes bvca was positively associated with cis dce table s6 and pce table s8 along depth of both aquifers while vcra was positively associated with cis dce in lower surficial aquifer table s6 for methanotrophs positive associations were observed for mmox with cis dce in lower surficial aquifer table s6 and with tce and pce in both aquifers tables s7 and s8 pce tce and cis dce were positively associated with total bacterial 16s rrna genes in both upper and lower surficial aquifers while cis dce was related to total bacterial 16s rrna gene only in the lower surficial aquifer ethene

biodegradation cryo coring was successful in capturing data trends that reveal steep biogeochemical gradients and pockets of microbial activity that would not be evident from typical monitoring well groundwater samples our data show that this site has complicated and variable geochemical environments which are likely governed by the site hydrogeology high spatial resolution trends in geochemistry and biomarkers were evident in each of the cores but the connections between the cores were more difficult to interpret the highest pce and tce contamination was at the upper surficial aquifer of core 1 which was the closest to the source zone fig 2 farther along the soil core transect pce concentrations decreased while tce cis dce and vc accumulated in further and deeper parts of the aquifer fig 2 these trends could suggest chlorinated ethene dechlorination was occurring along the movement of the plumes but could also indicate that the sampling transect was not along the centerline of the chlorinated ethene plume comparison with historical data vroblesky et al 2009 suggests our sampling transect was parallel to the plume but was possibly off centerline as evidenced by the difference in chloride values in core 3 samples as compared to the other cores groundwater contours also curve near the end of our transect as a result of groundwater entering a collapsed storm drain further complicating our understanding of plume movement in the groundwater vroblesky et al 2009 vertical concentration profiles in the cores showed clear evidence of biodegradation in the vicinity of the source area the large bifurcated vc peak between 2 2 and 3 0 m observed in core 1 which coincided with an ethene peak provides further evidence of complete dechlorination of pce to ethene at this site this is despite relatively low ph across most of the site particularly in core 1 between 0 97 and 3 4 m bgs where the ph ranges between 4 4 and 5 9 su fig s6 this is well below the ph range for dechlorination by known dehalococcoides sp ph 6 8 su löffler et al 2013 in addition csia data from core 1 showed pce had more negative δ13c values than for tce cis dce and vc providing a second line of evidence that anaerobic reductive dechlorination was occurring table 1 terminal electron acceptor concentrations showed clear differences in the redox conditions between the upper and lower regions of the surficial aquifer sulfate and iron reduction were evident in the upper surficial aquifer in cores 1 and 2 the lower surficial aquifer did not show signs of iron or sulfate reduction this suggests that the groundwater in the lower surficial aquifer did not transit the upper surficial aquifer but rather recharged from a distant location although no impermeable layer separates the upper and lower surficial aquifer there were large differences in observed chemical and hydrological characteristics neither oxygen nor nitrate were detected in any samples indicating oxygen limiting conditions throughout the aquifer 4 2 abundance and distribution of biomarkers geochemical and csia data alone in the core samples could not differentiate between aerobic and anaerobic vc biodegradation processes however the potential for in situ aerobic vc degradation in soil samples from site 45 is demonstrated by estimating the abundance of related functional genes and transcripts i e etnc etne mmox and pmoa using qpcr techniques we also estimated the abundance of anaerobic vc reductive dehalogenases this is the first field study to investigate the distribution of three vc degrading bacterial guilds at high spatial resolution through the use of cryogenic soil coring etheneotrophs and anaerobic vc dechlorinators were present throughout the site and were found to coexist in 55 of soil samples specifically functional genes from etheneotrophs and vc dechlorinators were at similar abundance 103 105 copies g soil in samples from core 1 2 2 2 5 m bgs 3 7 4 9 m bgs and core 4 3 7 5 4 m bgs which were predominantly anaerobic the overlapping distributions of aerobic etheneotrophs and anaerobic vc dechlorinators suggests the presence of aerobic and anaerobic microenvironments or temporal changes in aquifer geochemistry that allow these microorganisms to coexist in very close spatial proximity within 0 25 g of unhomogenized soil the high spatial resolution of our soil sample analysis confirmed previous reports of the co existence and expression of functional genes from aerobic and anaerobic vc degrading bacteria in anoxic groundwater samples liang et al 2017a 2017b and demonstrates that their simultaneous detection is not an artifact of groundwater sampling techniques this is an important finding as previous reports of the overlapping presence of etheneotrophs and anaerobic vc dechlorinator functional genes in situ relied on groundwater sampling liang et al 2017a 2017b the use of cryogenic coring is the best possible way to prevent fluids distribution during sample recovery and as a consequence our data represent the most compelling demonstration to date that aerobic and anaerobic vc degradation bacterial groups coexist in small sediment samples the presence of functional genes from etheneotrophs and anaerobic vc dechlorinators in anaerobic portions of the aquifer does not necessarily indicate that these microorganisms were active unfortunately rna extraction from soil samples 5 g was unsuccessful likely as a result of low biomass in the samples average dna concentrations 209 ng g soil and the instability of rna during extraction however etheneotroph and vc dechlorinator functional gene transcripts were detected in nearby contemporaneous groundwater samples by virtue of much larger sample size 3 l groundwater taken together the presence of etheneotroph functional genes and vc reductive dehalogenase genes in soil and transcripts of these genes in adjacent groundwater suggest that both aerobic and anaerobic vc degrading bacteria were both present and active throughout the aquifer 4 3 correlations between biomarkers and geochemical conditions etheneotroph functional genes were only correlated to vc concentrations in the lower surficial aquifer etheneotrophs can oxidize vc via co metabolism with ethene as the primary growth substrate freedman and herz 1996 and some etheneotrophs use vc as sole carbon source under laboratory conditions jin and mattes 2008 vc and ethene concentrations both showed positive relationships with etnc and etne abundances in the lower surficial aquifer this further supports similar relationships noted in groundwater samples liang et al 2017b and suggests that both vc and ethene supported the growth of etheneotrophs in portions of the lower surficial aquifer the absence of associations of etheneotroph functional genes with vc in the upper surficial aquifer could be explained by etheneotrophs being more strongly influenced by other factors such as do levels which decreased with depth from the unsaturated zone lee et al 2015 noll et al 2005 although oxygen in all soil samples were below detection limit 0 13 mg l sulfate was abundant at the top of the cores and declined with depth suggesting that a more favorable terminal electron acceptor was available in shallow portions of the core possibly a low level flux oxygen that went undetected in the lower surficial aquifer vertical oxygen flux would not be expected and terminal electron accepting conditions may be relatively constant allowing the influence of vc concentrations on etheneotrophs to be revealed the positive relationship between vc concentrations and vc reductive dehalogenase gene abundances in the lower surficial aquifer could be explained by anaerobic vc dechlorinators using vc as electron acceptor he et al 2003 among the two vc reductive dehalogenase genes bvca was generally more abundant than vcra this observation is consistent with previous studies where both genes were tracked in microcosms and at a contaminated site atashgahi et al 2013 lee et al 2008 only bvca was correlated to vc concentrations in the upper surficial aquifer samples the lack of correlation between vcra and vc in the upper surficial aquifer could be explained in part to ph in this region of the site being well below the optimum for dehalococcoides 6 8 su löffler et al 2013 a previous study which suggests that anaerobic vc dechlorinators employ bvca for growth on vc in less reducing conditions van der zaan et al 2010 however high toc concentrations apparent sulfate depletion with depth and the presence of ferrous iron indicate relatively strong reducing conditions in the upper surficial aquifer samples the positive association between toc and total bacteria and vc degrading bacteria indicate toc most likely derived from previous emulsified zvi injections supported overall bacterial growth at site 45 vc oxidizing bacteria and their functional genes have previously been observed in oxygen limited subsurface environments and in microcosms containing material collected from such environments fullerton et al 2014 gossett 2010 liang et al 2017b extensive searches have failed to reveal any organism capable of vc oxidation with an electron acceptor other than oxygen freedman et al 2013 several vc oxidizing isolates display very low oxygen half velocity constants 0 07 0 3 mg l coleman et al 2002 and thus the ability to scavenge oxygen under very low do conditions it has been suggested that the systems where anaerobic vc oxidation was reported were not truly anaerobic but experienced a cryptic low level oxygen flux freedman et al 2013 gossett 2010 indeed sustained vc oxidation at do levels below 0 02 mg l have has been demonstrated in microcosms provided with a low level do flux gossett 2010 this suggests that vc oxidizing bacteria can exist at the interface of strongly anaerobic subsurface regions the significant heterogeneity observed at some contaminated sites suggest that very low do zones are intermingled with truly anaerobic zones allowing for very close proximity of aerobic and anaerobic vc degrading bacteria the possibility that low level do fluxes can occur at depth in contaminated aquifers and sustain aerobic bacterial populations warrants further study in contrast to functional genes from etheneotrophs and anaerobic vc dechlorinators methanotroph functional genes were not correlated with vc concentrations in either the upper or lower surficial aquifer samples this is consistent with previously reported groundwater data liang et al 2017b and we suspect this is related to the fact that methanotrophs only co metabolize vc overall methanotroph functional genes were of relatively low abundance at site 45 as compared to a previous study of groundwater samples from a dilute vc plume liang et al 2017a suggesting that vc co metabolism by methanotrophs was not a major pathway for vc attenuation the negative correlations between methane and methanotroph functional genes in the upper surficial aquifer could be explained by aerobic growth of methanotrophs at the expense of methane the absence of correlations of mmox and the weak correlations of pmoa with methane in the lower surficial aquifer suggest that geochemical conditions in the lower surficial aquifer were not ideal for growth of methanotrophs associations between cis dce concentrations and vc biodegradation functional genes were similar to those seen with vc concentrations these positive associations could be present because cis dce is the parent compound of vc and that cis dce is used as an electron acceptor by vc dechlorinators carrying bvca and or vcra löffler et al 2013 the associations between pce and tce concentrations and vc biodegradation functional genes differed from those seen with cis dce and vc concentrations i e they were associated with etheneotroph functional genes but not vc reductive dehalogenases in both the upper and lower surficial aquifers similar correlations were observed previously with monitoring well groundwater samples liang et al 2017b 4 4 conclusions cryogenic coring can capture higher spatial resolution samples than would be possible with monitoring wells and is effective for capturing high resolution trends in biomarker and geochemical data cryogenic coring eliminates fluids re distribution during sampling and thus provides the best available evidence for coexistence of functional genes from aerobic and anaerobic vc degrading bacterial guilds functional genes from aerobic vc degrading bacteria both etheneotrophs and methanotrophs are present and widely distributed in an apparently anaerobic aquifer improved methods for isolating rna from environmental samples are necessary in order to quantify biological activity in the subsurface at a comparable spatial resolution an improved understanding of aerobic vc degradation under low do concentrations and low oxygen flux conditions would be useful in designing and implementing natural attenuation or aerobic bioremediation strategies for site cleanup acknowledgements the work was

18862,nitrochlorobenzene compounds ncbs are of key interest in environmental monitoring due to their high toxicity to better understand the presence and fate of ncbs in aquatic environments an in situ

chloronitrobenzene pncb ortho chloronitrobenzene oncb and 2 4 dinitrochlorobenzene cdnb are heavily used in the production of dyes pesticides drugs and other chemical products as raw materials and intermediates zhang et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 arora and bae 2014 however ncbs have been blacklisted as priority pollutants by the european economic community eec 1982 and the u s environmental protection agency usepa 1988 because of their high toxicity ncbs are responsible for causing methemoglobinemia anemia cancer and damages in the nervous system by inhalation ingestion or skin absorption even at a repeated low dose skin exposure travlos et al 1996 shen et al 2008 paramasivan et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 china is currently the main ncbs producer and consumer with an annual yield of about 470 000 tons until 2010 accounting for 74 of the total global production wang 2015 such large scale production and long term use of ncbs inevitably results in the pollution of natural water bodies consequently increasing the exposure of the human population to ncbs to minimize any potential harmful impacts on humans the chinese government has established a threshold of 0 50 mg l for chloronitrobenzenes and 0 05 mg l for dichloronitrobenzene in centralized drinking water sources chinese ministry of health 2001 however ncbs have frequently been detected in concentrations ranging from 0 01 to 5 07 μg l in the major chinese rivers e g songhua river yangtz river and yellow river tian et al 2003 li et al 2006 he et al 2006 and even at a level of 19 60 mg l in a river near an industrial plant xu and xu 1999 significantly threatening human health and the ecosystem in addition due to the strong electron withdrawing nature of nitro and chlorine substituent groups on the benzene ring ncbs are relatively recalcitrant in aquatic environments and resistant to microbial degradation xia et al 2011 resulting in the accumulation of these substances and consequently enhanced toxicity therefore the monitoring of ncbs in surface water is an essential approach to assess ecotoxicological risks and to protect humans and aquatic organisms current procedures available for the measurement of ncbs are extensively based on grab sampling and laboratory analysis of collected water e g liquid liquid extraction lle ong et al 1992 zhang et al 2011 solid phase extraction spe gao et

fid gas chromatography electron capture detection gc ecd or gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms however these methods show poor performance at low concentration levels and in dynamic systems in addition the measurements might be affected by the degradation of contaminants during storage or transportation of water samples and by concentration fluctuations alvarez et al 2005 novic et al 2017 therefore a better scientific and universally valid sampling strategy is crucial for adequately assessing the occurrence behavior fate and ecological risks of ncbs in situ passive sampling emerging as an alternative sampling method to monitor aquatic environments enables to measure extremely low concentrations of contaminants and provides time integrated concentrations of contaminants which is specifically recommended as a promising tool for the compliance checking and trend monitoring of priority substances in the european union water framework directive eu wfd eu 2013 different passive

polyethylene devices ped adams et al 2007 and diffusive gradients in thin films dgt chen et al 2012 have been developed successfully to in situ monitor various organic pollutants but have rarely been used to detect ncbs in aquatic environments vrana et al 2005 among the currently available samplers most samplers are considerably limited by the discrepancy of sampling rates from laboratory and field studies which stems from the complexity of environmental factors e g hydrodynamic conditions salinity ph thereby increasing the measurement uncertainty petty et al 2004 while the dgt technique with molecular diffusion control appears to be a robust approach to evaluate the presence and fate of ncbs without the need for tedious calibration chen et al 2012 according to the principle of dgt analytes are transported across the diffusion layer consisting of a filter membrane and a diffusive gel to the binding gel by molecular diffusion davison and zhang 1994 in this way metals nutrients and other labile inorganic elements can effectively be measured in situ in various environments zhang and davison 1995 2000 this approach also shows a strong tolerance to interference by hydrodynamic conditions above a threshold level of convection and other influencing factors zhang and davison 1995 implying its great application potential for organic chemicals under field conditions recently dgt devices based on several binding materials such as xad 18 resin activated charcoal or hydrophilic lipophilic balanced hlb have successfully been developed and validated to measure pharmaceuticals chen

molecules jeong et al 2017 but also the wide use as binding agent in pocis in studies of polar organic chemicals petty et al 2004 it is reasonable to assume that the dgt method using hlb resin as the binding phase could be suitable for in situ ncbs measurement to the best of our knowledge the dgt method has yet to be applied to monitor ncbs and the diffusion coefficients for ncbs in agarose gels

by the ncbs concentrations measured by the gc ecd from the eluents as shown in equation 2 2 m c e v g v e f e where c e is the accumulated ncbs concentrations in the eluent v e and v g represent the volume of the eluent and binding gel respectively and f e is the elution efficiency 2 4 preparation of dgt assembly the dgt assembly is composed of the binding gel the diffusive gel and the filter membrane contained in the piston type plastic moldings purchased from weishen nanjing www dgtresearch com cn davison and zhang 1994 the hlb binding gels and diffusive gels were prepared using 1 5 agarose according to previously reported methods zhang and davison 1999 challis et al 2016 briefly the hlb binding gel 0 80 mm thickness was prepared by mixing 0 69 g of hlb powder dry weight supporting information text s1 with 10 ml of solution containing 0 15 g of agarose heated until transparent subsequently the hot agarose solution was immediately pipetted into two preheated glass plates separated by a 0 80 mm plastic spacer and left to cool down to room temperature followed by being cut into discs with a diameter of 2 5 cm the diffusive gel 0 80 mm thickness was prepared following the same procedure but without hlb powder all discs were hydrated in ultrapure water for 24 h and stored in 0 01 m nacl solution at 4 c to assess the adsorption of ncbs onto the dgt device materials agarose based diffusive gels and five filter membranes pes mce ptfe ghp and nl were individually soaked in 10 ml of 500 μg l mncb pncb oncb or cdnb solutions and then shaken horizontally for 18 h while acetonitrile butadiene styrene abs dgt moldings were immersed in 200 ml of 500 μg l mncb pncb oncb or cdnb solutions due to their relatively larger geometrical size the abs moldings were pre cleaned with methanol for at least 24 h and rinsed thoroughly with ultrapure water prior to use the mass adsorbed onto each component can be calculated by the differences of ncbs concentrations in solution between before and after the exposure 2 5 diffusion coefficient measurements the diffusion coefficient d cm2 s is required for the calculation of the dgt concentration since d values for ncbs diffusion through the agarose hydrogel are not available in the literature they were determined using both a previously described diffusion cell d cell zhang and davison 1999 and the dgt assembly d dgt method zheng et al 2015 see supporting information text s4 2 6 characteristics of dgt performance in solution 2 6 1 uptake and elution efficiency to assess the binding kinetic properties of the hlb gel for polar ncbs the hlb gel discs were separately immersed in 5 ml of ncbs solution containing 1 mg l mncb pncb oncb and cdnb as well as 0 01 m nacl at ph 6 4 for different time intervals ranging from 5 min to 12 h to reduce the error from liquid liquid extraction procedure 100 μl of each solution were collected directly at known time intervals for ncbs analysis by hplc dad the differences between the measured and initial concentrations of ncbs were used to determine the mass of uptake by the hlb binding materials to develop the optimal procedure for elution of ncbs adsorbed on hlb gels we trialed two eluents i e methanol and toluene the amounts of the eluents ranging from 5 to 15 ml addition of 5 ml each time and the ultrasonic period from 15 to 60 min each time the hlb gel discs were soaked in 5 ml of 250 μg l ncbs solution containing 0 01 m nacl at ph 6 7 and then shaken for 24 h to preselect the eluent the ncbs adsorbed hlb gels were taken out and eluted separately by 5 ml methanol and toluene for 15 min via ultrasonic extraction based on the eluent subsequent optimization elution procedures for ncbs bound to hlb gels were tested by 1 15 min of ultrasonic extraction with 5 ml of eluent 2 30 min of ultrasonic extraction with 5 ml of eluent 3 15 min of ultrasonic extraction with 10 ml of eluent for two extractions 4 30 min of ultrasonic extraction with 10 ml of eluent for two extractions 5 60 min of ultrasonic extraction with 15 ml of eluent for three extractions once the optimal elution procedure was determined the recoveries were tested for 0 10 0 50 and 10 mg l ncbs to verify the stable applicability for different concentrations the elution efficiency f e was expressed as the ratio of the eluted ncbs mass to the mass initially bound on the hlb gels based on equation 2 2 6 2 time dependence the hlb dgt devices were deployed in 5 l of well stirred solution containing 100 μg l ncbs and 0 01 m nacl at ph 6 5 0 2 all testing solutions were renewed daily and vigorously stirred at a temperature of 25 2 c and a stirring rate of 600 rpm during the different deployment times varying between 1 and 5 days after retrieval of the dgt device the hlb gel with adsorbed ncbs was treated as outlined above and analyzed by gc ecd in addition 5 ml of deployment solution was sampled at the beginning middle and end of the experiment and extracted with isometric toluene to check for possible concentration changes to avoid volatilization and photodegradation all containers were covered with plastic wrap and aluminium foil during the deployment period 2 6 3 dgt capacity to investigate the capacity of hlb dgt for ncbs adsorption the devices were deployed for 18 h in 5 l of well stirred 0 01 m nacl solution ph 6 7 0 2 temperature 25 0 3 c containing various concentrations of ncbs 0 1 1 5 10 20 50 70 and 100 mg l 2 6 4 effects of ph ionic strength and dom on dgt performance the ph ionic strength and dissolved organic matter dom concentration of natural water samples typically range between 5 and 8 5 0 01 0 5 m and 1 20 mg l respectively sobek et al 2007 li et al 2011 chen et al 2012 thus the effects of ph ionic strength and dom on dgt performance were evaluated by deploying hlb dgt devices in 5 l of 100 μg l ncbs solutions under various conditions 1 with a range of ph from 3 to 9 2 at ph 6 5 0 2 with ionic strengths ranging from 0 001 m to 0 5 m 3 at ph 6 7 0 2 with a range of dom concentrations from 0 to 20 mg l after 24 h deployment the dgt devices were retrieved and the adsobed ncbs on the hlb gels were extracted and analyzed the ph of the solutions was adjusted by using 0 01 m hcl and naoh solutions 2 6 5 effect of diffusive boundary layer on dgt performance to investigate the effect of the diffusive boundary layer dbl on dgt performance triplicates of hlb dgt assemblies with 0 80 mm diffusive gels were separately deployed in solutions at ph 6 9 0 2 containing 100 μg l ncbs and 0 01 m nacl for stirring 18 h under varying stirring rates from 0 to 500 rpm after the experiment the ncbs on the hlb gels were extracted and analyzed all deployment solutions were stirred at a temperature of 25 0 6 c and water samples of the ncbs solution were collected prior to deployment of the hlb dgt and after the retrieval of each set of dgt devices 2 7 field deployment to evaluate the viability of the hlb dgt devices for measuring ncbs in natural waters field deployments were conducted in july 2018 in the black and malodorous jiuxiang river which was a representative source of contamination to the receiving river yangtze river in recent years various persistent organic pollutants i e bisphenols zheng et al 2015 perfluoroalkyl substances guan et al 2018 and pharmaceuticals and personal care products wei et al 2018 have been widely measured in this river details of the sampling site have been described in figure s1 in the field application the hlb dgt devices were stored in containers filled with 0 01 m nacl solutions and transported to the sampling site the devices in sextuplicate were deployed in river water at a depth of 40 cm below the surface for 7 days at the end of the deployment period devices were retrieved and thoroughly rinsed on site with ultrapure water subsequently the retrieved hlb dgt devices were placed in clean bags and transported to the laboratory for sample treatments and gc ecd analysis the ncbs concentrations in water samples were also determined daily using the conventional grab sampling and the spe handling method see supporting information text s5 during the deployment period water quality parameters and precipitation were monitored as shown in figure s2 and table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 assessing adsorption of ncbs on dgt materials fig 1 shows the adsorption efficiencies of ncbs on different dgt materials including moldings abs diffusive gel agarose and five often used filters pes mce ptfe ghp and nl after their exposure to the ncbs solution the average efficiencies for ncbs adsorbed onto abs moldings agarose based diffusive gel pes mce ptfe ghp and nl ranged between 0 31 0 81 2 60 6 06 98 09 98 57 75 28 89 98 0 76 10 85 1 31 6 40 and 4 80 13 84 respectively no measurable adsorption of ncbs to abs moldings 1 and agarose based diffusive gels 6 could be observed which explains the wide use in dgt assemblies for measuring organic compounds such as bisphenols and various drugs zheng et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 similarly ncbs were only slightly adsorbed onto ghp 7 as compared to pes and mce indicating that ghp is more suitable as a filter membrane of dgt a similar result has been reported by zhang et al 2018 who found that the filter could adsorb 30 two organic illicit drugs the result found for pes agrees well with vermeirssen et al 2012 who reported that moderate polar organic compounds accumulate preferentially on pes consequently ghp filters were chosen for use in dgt devices in the following experiments 3 2 diffusion coefficient measurements according to the principle of dgt the accuracy of the dgt measurement is largely determined by the diffusion coefficient chen et al 2012 the diffusion coefficients d cell and d dgt at 25 c of agarose based gels for ncbs are shown in table 1 the values of d cell were 7 20 0 12 10 6 7 44 0 15 10 6 7 49 0 21 10 6 and 7 19 0 21 10 6 cm2 s for mncb pncb oncb and cdnb respectively the average values of d dgt for mncb pncb oncb and cdnb were 7 27 0 37 10 6 7 69 0 39 10 6 7 56 0 37 10 6 and 7 01 0 36 10 6 cm2 s which were similar to d cell with a bias of less than 3 5 consistent values for d cell and d dgt have previously been reported for a number of organic compounds such as bisphenols zheng et al 2015 and perfluoroalkyl substances guan et al 2018 the d cell values of ncbs are comparable to that of 7 6 10 6 cm2 s for methcathinone zhang et al 2018 but much higher than those for bisphenols which range from 4 44 10 6 to 5 64 10 6 cm2 s zheng et al 2015 perfluoroalkyl substances ranging from 4 37 10 6 to 5 08 10 6 cm2 s guan et al 2018 and other tested organic compounds xie et al 2018b these differences are due to the different molecular weights of the chemicals zhang and davison 1999 3 3 uptake and elution efficiencies the rapid binding kinetics of the analytes onto the binding resins satisfies the basic requirements of the dgt methodology which is a prerequisite for dgt performance chen et al 2012 as depicted in fig 2 mncb pncb oncb and cdnb in solutions adsorbed by hlb gels increased linearly within the first 30 min with average binding rates of 16 31 16 48 16 35 and 16 07 ng cm2 min indicating a fast binding of ncbs onto the hlb gels after that more than 97 of the ncbs in the solutions were adsorbed by the hlb gels within 120 min furthermore the flux of mncb pncb oncb and cdnb were 5 24 5 67 5 25 and 4 92 ng cm2 min which were calculated by deploying dgt devices in a well stirred ncbs solution with the same temperature and concentration obviously the average binding rates of the hlb gel for mncb pncb oncb and cdnb were much higher than the flux of dgt this suggests that the concentrations of ncbs at the diffusive gel binding gel interface are effectively zero these results confirm the potential of hlb dgt for the measurement of ncbs as mentioned previously methanol and toluene are considered as effective extractants for eluting a series of organic compounds from the stationary phase in gc based methods dziadas and jelen 2010 zacs et al 2018 in addition methanol has been used to effectively remove the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole bound to xad based binding gels chen et al 2012 accordingly we investigated the extraction ability of these substances for ncbs from hlb gels as shown in figure s3 the average recoveries of ncbs with methanol ranged from 6 70 2 95 to 19 50 1 91 while for toluene 64 93 4 60 to 70 62 4 10 were achieved this is likely to be caused by the more similar values of log kow between ncbs i e mncb 2 46 pncb 2 39 oncb 2 24 and cdnb 2 17 table s1 and toluene 2 73 as compared to methanol 0 77 therefore toluene was chosen as a more effective eluent for ncbs in the remaining experiments quantitative and reproducible recoveries of ncbs from the hlb gels are required for a precise characterization of dgt measured concentrations in aqueous environments the average elution efficiencies of ncbs with higher amounts of toluene and longer periods of ultrasonic extraction increased from 73 24 4 71 to 110 47 0 50 fig 3 however the elution efficiencies of mncb pncb oncb and cdnb increased to 101 98 0 57 104 63 0 44 103 13 0 92 and 110 47 0 50 with 30 min of ultrasonic extraction by 10 ml toluene for two extractions and changed negligibly in the further optimization procedure e g those of 99 84 7 91 103 14 8 04 101 44 7 89 and 107 15 9 68 with 60 min of ultrasonic extraction by 15 ml toluene for three extractions indicating that the optimal extraction level has been reached moreover we also observed good and stable recoveries ranging from 89 81 4 32 to 110 47 0 50 for ncbs across a range of exposure concentrations 0 10 10 mg l figure s4 therefore a combination of 30 min of ultrasonic extraction and 10 ml of toluene for two extractions was selected as the most efficient extraction method in the following experiments 3 4 effects of ph ionic strength and dom on dgt measurement of ncbs the influences of ph ionic strength and concentration of dom on dgt performance for measuring ncbs are presented in fig 4 a the dgt measured concentrations of ncbs cdgt were in good agreement with the directly measured concentrations csolution in deployment solutions with the derived ratios of cdgt csolution ranging from 0 95 to 1 06 at ph levels ranging from 3 05 to 9 08 fig 4a1 indicating that the ph within this range does not affect dgt measurement of ncbs in a previous study hlb dgt performance was independent of ph within the range of 3 5 9 5 in terms of measuring the majority of tested household and personal care products and edcs chen et al 2017 2018 most likely the neutral forms of the tested compounds including ncbs have high retention factors for neutral hlb resins bauerlein et al 2012 this has also been confirmed by li et al 2011 who found that the sampling rate of pocis housing hlb sorbents was relatively constant across the range of ph for neutral species the effect of ionic strength ranging from 0 001 to 0 5 m on the accuracy of ncbs quantification is shown in fig 4a2 the average ratios of cdgt csolution ranged from 0 94 to 1 03 which is within the acceptable limits 1 0 0 1 with the only exception for cdnb whose cdgt csolution value was in the range of 0 85 0 94 this suggests that the uptake of ncbs by hlb dgt is unaffected by ionic strengths from 0 001 to 0 5 m and that dgt can be used in both freshwaters and wastewaters for the monitoring of ncbs these results are in agreement with previous reports for bisphenols using dgt with activated charcoal gels zheng et al 2015 and for edcs using pocis with hlb sorbents zhang et al 2008 as illustrated in fig 4a3 there were good agreements between cdgt and the known concentrations csolution in solutions with dom concentrations ranging from 0 to 20 mg l as indicated by the cdgt csolution ratios which were generally between 0 98 and 1 07 we observed no effect of increased dom concentrations on dgt measurements of ncbs most likely because the diffusion coefficients of dom in agarose gel ranging from 0 9 10 6 to 2 5 10 6 cm2 s lead et al 2003 were much lower than those of ncbs thus resulting in less competition with ncbs for adsorption sites this is consistent with the findings of chen et al 2018 who observed no effects of dom on the uptake of most edcs by hlb dgt 3 5 effect of the dbl on dgt performance when a dgt device is deployed in solution the dbl is formed at the surface of the filter membrane and becomes part of the diffusion layer controlling the molecular diffusion of analytes between the solution and the binding layer davison and zhang 2012 fig 4b shows that the values of the cdgt csolution ratio for all analytes were only around 0 6 under static conditions 0 rpm and 1 0 0 1 under well stirred conditions 250 and 500 rpm under quiescent conditions the dbl thicknesses of mncb 0 59 0 01 mm pncb 0 63 0 03 mm oncb 0 62 0 01 mm and cdnb 0 67 0 02 mm estimated by equation s1 were similar to dbl reported by chen et al 2018 and challis et al 2016 who observed a thickness of 0 76 mm for sulfamethozazole and 0 75 mm for thiamethoxam in unstirred solutions such dbl thicknesses could bring a great error to the dgt measurement if it is ignored however dgt performance is not affected if the solution is moderately stirred with a stirring rate of above 250 rpm therefore in this study the effect of dbl on hlb dgt with a 0 8 mm diffusive gel was ignored for all experiments in test solutions as the stirring rate was normally 600 rpm when hlb dgt devices were applied in unknown environments different thickness of diffusive layers can be used to evaluate the effect of dbl according to equation s2 3 6 time dependence the mass of ncbs accumulated by dgt devices increased linearly with increasing deployment time over 120 h for all four tested chemicals r2 from 0 9918 to 0 9986 figure s5 demonstrating the reliability and stability of sampling using dgt good agreement was observed between calculated theoretical values and measured values indicating that dgt devices equipped with hlb gels are able to measure ncbs concentrations accurately 3 7 dgt capacity to ensure accurate measurement of ncbs using the dgt technique under conditions of high concentrations or long term monitoring a high capacity is essential for the hlb binding gel the mass of ncbs bound onto the hlb gel initially increased linearly with increasing solution concentrations figure s6 and the capacities of the hlb gels were at least 114 65 117 52 117 72 and 37 58 μg cm2 for mncb pncb oncb and cdnb respectively assuming that the dgt devices are deployed for 1 week the maximum concentration of each ncbs in the waters would be at least 818 μg l without exceeding the capacity if the deployment time is 1 month it would be at least 191 μg l however ncbs concentrations were ranged from the ng l level to several ug l in most natural waters he et al 2006 hence the measured binding capacity of hlb dgt is sufficient for monitoring ncbs in waters 3 8 dgt blanks and quantitation limits table 2 summarizes the concentrations of dgt blanks the loqs and the method quantitation limits mqls for ncbs no ncbs were detected in the hlb gels of dgt blanks both in the laboratory and field due to the exceedingly high sensitivity of ecd detectors for halogen elements the loqs of ncbs for gc ecd ranging from 0 18 0 01 to 0 35 0 07 μg l were an order of magnitude lower than those for hplc dad ranging from 16 75 0 36 to 46 80 1 47 μg l based on the loqs of gc ecd for ncbs the average mqls of the isovolume extraction method for water samples in the laboratory and the spe based method ranged between 0 19 0 02 0 30 0 06 μg l and 0 95 0 10 1 50 0 30 ng l respectively the mqls for dgt measured ncbs ranged from 1 46 0 08 to 2 84 0 57 ng l for a deployment time of 7 days 168 h at 25 c which can meet the requirements for the monitoring of ncbs concentrations in natural waters he et al 2006 in waters with ncbs concentrations below the mql a deployment period longer than 168 h and or a diffusive gel layer thinner than 0 80 mm could be applied therefore hlb dgt coupled with gc ecd is suitable for ultra trace analysis of ncbs 3 9 application in the field the present method was firstly tested in environmental samples and the obtained results are presented in fig 5 the concentrations measured using the grab sampling method were ranging from 6 63 0 26 ng l to 187 04 12 73 ng l for mncb 9 92 0 55 ng l to 237 36 15 17 ng l for pncb 7 23 0 50 ng l to 143 88 2 53 ng l for oncb and 4 43 0 29 ng l to 49 29 29 59 ng l for cdnb respectively correspondingly the calculated averaged concentrations for mncb pncb oncb and cdnb were 55 35 69 95 47 65 and 18 10 ng l table s3 while the dgt measured concentrations of mncb pncb oncb and cdnb were 79 15 6 31 80 28 5 45 65 46 5 12 and 33 77 3 62 ng l respectively there is no significant difference between dgt measured concentrations and the calculated averaged concentrations using grab sampling t test p 0 01 text s2 indicating that the results from two methods were comparable obviously with the grab sampling method significant fluctuations in ncbs concentrations were observed during the sampling period which might be caused by the rainfall figure s2 this effect was especially apparent with the heavy rainfall on the sixth day accelerating the mixture of river water rainwater and upstream sewage and or the release of target chemicals from the sediment of the yangshan lake to main river moreover the average ncbs concentrations calculated via the grab sampling method were generally 17 46 less than the dgt measured concentrations table s3 suggesting that the grab sampling method seriously underestimates the average concentrations this underestimation is probably the result of the loss of ncbs during storage transportation and spe enrichment of grab samples in previous studies the deviation of results between grab and passive sampling method were also found for household and personal care products chen et al 2017 and for perfluoroalkyl substances guan et al 2018 in addition the variabilities of dgt measured ncbs concentrations at the same location for the same time were low sd 11 n 6 these findings demonstrated that the quantification of ncbs in natural waters using the hlb dgt method is preferred over the traditional methods for the measurement of ncbs the routine grab sampling method has many limits firstly representative sample is required for the monitoring of micropollutant which is exact weakness of grab samples because of only providing a snapshot of environmental concentration levels novic et al 2017 while the dgt method can easily provide the time weighted average concentrations secondly the volume of grab sample may be insufficient to satisfy the detection limit requirement of commonly used analytical methods for ultratrace ncbs alvarez et al 2005 while hlb dgt can lower the detection limit by in situ preconcentrating ncbs for a long time thirdly much labor and time should be spend on the transport and pretreatment of grab samples resulting in that long term monitoring of contaminants using the grab sampling method is costly for high sampling frequencies especially in remote areas söderström et al 2009 the dgt method is relatively user friendly and cost efficient with a single operation and could save much time on the sample treatment by in situ preconcentration for example the present dgt based method allows continuous measurement of ncbs in aquatic systems possible for any period of time from days weeks and months although a deployment time of 7 days was chosen based on recommendations from other dgt studies zheng et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 different deployment times can be considered based on water quality and contamination levels fourthly high background interference signals were observed during the analysis of grab samples due to the retardation of nanopore size of the diffusive gel layer to larger molecules and selective retention of the hlb gel to ncbs the dgt extracts have the obvious advantages of a cleaner sample matrix less interference and easier analysis the last and most important point due to the semi volatility of ncbs wu et al 2013 the grab sampling method may underestimate the concentrations in aquatic environment when dgt is used ncbs were adsorbed in hlb gel avoiding the loss of ncbs during storage transportation and pretreatment of grab samples therefore hlb dgt shows more advantages than grab sampling method 4 conclusions a new method based on dgt for the measurement of ncbs in natural waters has been developed providing a first insight into in situ passive sampling of ncbs materials required for dgt devices were tested and a suitable filter membrane was selected to ensure the accurate measurement of ncbs by hlb dgt without potential adsorption effects the optimal elution procedure to effectively extract ncbs from hlb gels was developed the diffusion coefficients of ncbs were measured for the first time which is crucial for the calculation of dgt measured concentrations because of the stable performance of dgt under a wide range of environmental conditions i e ph 3 9 ionic strength 0 001 0 5 m dom 0 20 mg l this method holds great potential for the measurement of ultra trace analysis ncbs in complex matrices the developed method was successfully deployed under field conditions and provided the first in situ measurements of four ncbs without tedious and expensive pretreatments it can be a viable and attractive alternative to conventional ex situ water sampling for the routine monitoring of

18862,nitrochlorobenzene compounds ncbs are of key interest in environmental monitoring due to their high toxicity to better understand the presence and fate of ncbs in aquatic environments an in situ sampling technique of diffusive gradients in thin films dgt based on hydrophilic lipophilic balanced hlb resin combined with gas chromatography was developed to measure four typical ncbs e g meta chloronitrobenzene mncb para chloronitrobenzene pncb ortho chloronitrobenzene oncb and 2 4 dinitrochlorobenzene cdnb the diffusion coefficients of mncb pncb oncb and cdnb in agarose based gel were firstly determined in diffusion cell experiments and ranged from 7 19 10 6 to 7 49 10 6 cm s the capacities of hlb dgt for mncb pncb oncb and cdnb were higher than 114 65 117 52 117 72 and 37 58 μg

chloronitrobenzene pncb ortho chloronitrobenzene oncb and 2 4 dinitrochlorobenzene cdnb are heavily used in the production of dyes pesticides drugs and other chemical products as raw materials and intermediates zhang et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 arora and bae 2014 however ncbs have been blacklisted as priority pollutants by the european economic community eec 1982 and the u s environmental protection agency usepa 1988 because of their high toxicity ncbs are responsible for causing methemoglobinemia anemia cancer and damages in the nervous system by inhalation ingestion or skin absorption even at a repeated low dose skin exposure travlos et al 1996 shen et al 2008 paramasivan et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 china is currently the main ncbs producer and consumer with an annual yield of about 470 000 tons until 2010 accounting for 74 of the total global production wang 2015 such large scale production and long term use of ncbs inevitably results in the pollution of natural water bodies consequently increasing the exposure of the human population to ncbs to minimize any potential harmful impacts on humans the chinese government has established a threshold of 0 50 mg l for chloronitrobenzenes and 0 05 mg l for dichloronitrobenzene in centralized drinking water sources chinese ministry of health 2001 however ncbs have frequently been detected in concentrations ranging from 0 01 to 5 07 μg l in the major chinese rivers e g songhua river yangtz river and yellow river tian et al 2003 li et al 2006 he et al 2006 and even at a level of 19 60 mg l in a river near an industrial plant xu and xu 1999 significantly threatening human health and the ecosystem in addition due to the strong electron withdrawing nature of nitro and chlorine substituent groups on the benzene ring ncbs are relatively recalcitrant in aquatic environments and resistant to microbial degradation xia et al 2011 resulting in the accumulation of these substances and consequently enhanced toxicity therefore the monitoring of ncbs in surface water is an essential approach to assess ecotoxicological risks and to protect humans and aquatic organisms current procedures available for the

fid gas chromatography electron capture detection gc ecd or gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms however these methods show poor performance at low concentration levels and in dynamic systems in addition the measurements might be affected by the degradation of contaminants during storage or transportation of water samples and by concentration fluctuations alvarez et al 2005 novic et al 2017 therefore a better scientific and universally valid sampling strategy is crucial for adequately assessing the occurrence behavior fate and ecological risks of ncbs in situ passive sampling emerging as an alternative sampling method to monitor aquatic environments enables to measure extremely low concentrations of contaminants and provides time integrated concentrations of contaminants which is specifically recommended as a promising tool for the compliance checking and trend monitoring of priority substances in the european union water framework directive eu wfd eu 2013 different passive samplers such as but not limited to semipermeable membrane device spmd huckins et al 1990 chemcatcher kingston et al 2000 polar organic chemical integrative sampler pocis alvarez et al 2004 polyethylene devices ped adams et al 2007 and diffusive gradients in thin films dgt chen et al 2012 have been developed successfully to in situ monitor various organic pollutants but have rarely been used to detect ncbs in aquatic environments vrana et al 2005 among the currently available samplers most samplers are considerably limited by the discrepancy of sampling rates from laboratory and field studies which stems from the complexity of environmental factors e g hydrodynamic conditions salinity ph thereby increasing the measurement uncertainty petty et al 2004 while the dgt technique with molecular diffusion control appears to be a robust approach to evaluate the presence and fate of ncbs without the need for tedious calibration chen et al 2012 according to the principle of dgt analytes are transported across the diffusion layer consisting of a filter membrane and a diffusive gel to the binding gel by molecular diffusion davison and zhang 1994 in this way metals nutrients and other labile inorganic elements can effectively be measured in situ in various environments zhang and davison 1995 2000 this approach also shows a strong tolerance to interference by hydrodynamic conditions above a threshold level of convection and other influencing factors zhang and davison 1995 implying its great application potential for organic chemicals under field conditions recently dgt devices based on several binding materials such as xad 18 resin activated charcoal or hydrophilic lipophilic balanced hlb have successfully been developed and validated to measure pharmaceuticals chen et al 2012 stroski et al 2018 xie et al 2018a pesticides challis et al 2016 guibal et al 2017 4 chlorophenol dong et al 2014 illicit drugs guo et al 2017 and endocrine disrupting compounds edcs xie et al 2018b in different water sources including wastewater surface water and seawater considering not only the chemical similarities between polar groups pyrrolidone of hlb resin and polar ncbs molecules jeong et al 2017 but also the wide use as binding agent in pocis in studies of polar organic chemicals petty et al 2004 it is reasonable to assume that the dgt method using hlb resin as the binding phase could be suitable for in situ ncbs measurement to the best of our knowledge the dgt method has yet to be applied to monitor ncbs and the diffusion coefficients for ncbs in agarose gels are still unknown in this context the purpose of this study was to investigate an effective method based on hlb dgt for the precise measurement of ncbs i e mncb pncb oncb and cdnb in natural water bodies for this purpose the performance and efficiency of this method was conducted using laboratory evaluations the third aim was to apply calibrated samplers in natural waters and to compare with the results of grab sampling 2 material and methods 2 1 reagents and materials toluene hplc and methanol were purchased from tedia company us meta chloronitrobenzene mncb 99 and 2 4 dinitrochlorobenzene cdnb 99 were obtained from j k scientific ltd china para chloronitrobenzene pncb 99 and ortho chloronitrobenzene oncb 99 were purchased from tokyo chemical industry japan the physical chemical properties of the target compounds are listed in table s1 in the supporting information stock solutions 1 g l of ncbs were prepared using meoh and stored in brown colored glass bottles at 4 c the gh polypro ghp and polyether sulfone pes were purchased from pall co us while nylon nl polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe and mixed cellulose ester mce were obtained from jinteng corp tianjin china the spe cartridges oasis hlb 200 500 mg 6 ml were obtained from waters corporation milford ma us ultrapure water resistivity 18 2 mω cm was supplied by a laboratory water purification system pall cascada ix us further details of the chemicals are given in supporting information text s1 2 2 instruments due to the difficulty of extracting ncbs from micro volume water solutions these samples were directly analyzed using a high performance liquid chromatography photodiode array detector hplc dad agilent 1260 in addition all quantities of ncbs were measured using gc ecd agilent 7890a detailed instrumental conditions are provided in supporting information text s2 the instrumental limits of quantitation loq were based on the minimum measured concentration considering the signal noise ratio of 10 2 3 dgt calculations after a certain deployment time t the dgt measured concentration cdgt was calculated under well stirred solutions according to the standard principle of dgt as shown in equation 1 along with the diffusion coefficients d measured in the current study see supporting information text s3 davison and zhang 2012 thus 1 c d g t m δ g d a t where δg is the thickness of the diffusion layer and filter membrane a is the exposed area of the dgt in contact with the solutions m representing the mass of the ncbs accumulated on the binding gel can be determined by the ncbs concentrations measured by the gc ecd from the eluents as shown in equation 2 2 m c e v g v e f e where c e is the accumulated ncbs concentrations in the eluent v e and v g represent the volume of the eluent and binding gel respectively and f e is the elution efficiency 2 4 preparation of dgt assembly the dgt assembly is composed of the binding gel the diffusive gel and the filter membrane contained in the piston type plastic moldings purchased from weishen nanjing www dgtresearch com cn davison and zhang 1994 the hlb binding gels and diffusive gels were prepared using 1 5 agarose according to previously reported methods zhang and davison 1999 challis et al 2016 briefly the hlb binding gel 0 80 mm thickness was prepared by mixing 0 69 g of hlb powder dry weight supporting information text s1 with 10 ml of solution containing 0 15 g of agarose heated until transparent subsequently the hot agarose solution was immediately pipetted into two preheated glass plates separated by a 0 80 mm plastic spacer and left to cool down to room temperature followed by being cut into discs with a diameter of 2 5 cm the diffusive gel 0 80 mm thickness was prepared following the same procedure but without hlb powder all discs were hydrated in ultrapure water for 24 h and stored in 0 01 m nacl solution at 4 c to assess the adsorption of ncbs onto the dgt device materials agarose based diffusive gels and five filter membranes pes mce ptfe ghp and nl were individually soaked in 10 ml of 500 μg l mncb pncb oncb or cdnb solutions and then shaken horizontally for 18 h while acetonitrile butadiene styrene abs dgt moldings were immersed in 200 ml of 500 μg l mncb pncb oncb or cdnb solutions due to their relatively larger geometrical size the abs moldings were pre cleaned with methanol for at least 24 h and rinsed thoroughly with ultrapure water prior to use the mass adsorbed onto each component can be calculated by the differences of ncbs concentrations in solution between before and after the exposure 2 5 diffusion coefficient measurements the diffusion coefficient d cm2 s is required for the calculation of the dgt concentration since d values for ncbs diffusion through the agarose hydrogel are not available in the literature they were determined using both a previously described diffusion cell d cell zhang and davison 1999 and the dgt assembly d dgt method zheng et al 2015 see supporting information text s4 2 6 characteristics of dgt performance in solution 2 6 1 uptake and elution efficiency to assess the binding kinetic properties of the hlb gel for polar ncbs the hlb gel discs were separately immersed in 5 ml of ncbs solution containing 1 mg l mncb pncb oncb and cdnb as well as 0 01 m nacl at ph 6 4 for different time intervals ranging from 5 min to 12 h to reduce the error from liquid liquid extraction procedure 100 μl of each solution were collected directly at known time intervals for ncbs analysis by hplc dad the differences between the measured and initial concentrations of ncbs were used to determine the mass of uptake by the hlb binding materials to develop the optimal procedure for elution of ncbs adsorbed on hlb gels we trialed two eluents i e methanol and toluene the amounts of the eluents ranging from 5 to 15 ml addition of 5 ml each time and the ultrasonic period from 15 to 60 min each time the hlb gel discs were soaked in 5 ml of 250 μg l ncbs solution containing 0 01 m nacl at ph 6 7 and then shaken for 24 h to preselect the eluent the ncbs adsorbed hlb gels were taken out and eluted separately by 5 ml methanol and toluene for 15 min via ultrasonic extraction based on the eluent subsequent optimization elution procedures for ncbs bound to hlb gels were tested by 1 15 min of ultrasonic extraction with 5 ml of eluent 2 30 min of ultrasonic extraction with 5 ml of eluent 3 15 min of ultrasonic extraction with 10 ml of eluent for two extractions 4 30 min of ultrasonic extraction with 10 ml of eluent for two extractions 5 60 min of ultrasonic extraction with 15 ml of eluent for three extractions once the optimal elution procedure was determined the recoveries were tested for 0 10 0 50 and 10 mg l ncbs to verify the stable applicability for different concentrations the elution efficiency f e was expressed as the ratio of the eluted ncbs mass to the mass initially bound on the hlb gels based on equation 2 2 6 2 time dependence the hlb dgt devices were deployed in 5 l of well stirred solution containing 100 μg l ncbs and 0 01 m nacl at ph 6 5 0 2 all testing solutions were renewed daily and vigorously stirred at a temperature of 25 2 c and a stirring rate of 600 rpm during the different deployment times varying between 1 and 5 days after retrieval of the dgt device the hlb gel with adsorbed ncbs was treated as outlined above and analyzed by gc ecd in addition 5 ml of deployment solution was sampled at the beginning middle and end of the experiment and extracted with isometric toluene to check for possible concentration changes to avoid volatilization and photodegradation all containers were covered with plastic wrap and aluminium foil during the deployment period 2 6 3 dgt capacity to investigate the capacity of hlb dgt for ncbs adsorption the devices were deployed for 18 h in 5 l of well stirred 0 01 m nacl solution ph 6 7 0 2 temperature 25 0 3 c containing various concentrations of ncbs 0 1 1 5 10 20 50 70 and 100 mg l 2 6 4 effects of ph ionic strength and dom on dgt performance the ph ionic strength and dissolved organic matter dom concentration of natural water samples typically range between 5 and 8 5 0 01 0 5 m and 1 20 mg l respectively sobek et al 2007 li et al 2011 chen et al 2012 thus the effects of ph ionic strength and dom on dgt performance were evaluated by deploying hlb dgt devices in 5 l of 100 μg l ncbs solutions under various conditions 1 with a range of ph from 3 to 9 2 at ph 6 5 0 2 with ionic strengths ranging from 0 001 m to 0 5 m 3 at ph 6 7 0 2 with a range of dom concentrations from 0 to 20 mg l after 24 h deployment the dgt devices were retrieved and the adsobed ncbs on the hlb gels were extracted and analyzed the ph of the solutions was adjusted by using 0 01 m hcl and naoh solutions 2 6 5 effect of diffusive boundary layer on dgt performance to investigate the effect of the diffusive boundary layer dbl on dgt performance triplicates of hlb dgt assemblies with 0 80 mm diffusive gels were separately deployed in solutions at ph 6 9 0 2 containing 100 μg l ncbs and 0 01 m nacl for stirring 18 h under varying stirring rates from 0 to 500 rpm after the experiment the ncbs on the hlb gels were extracted and analyzed all deployment solutions were stirred at a temperature of 25 0 6 c and water samples of the ncbs solution were collected prior to deployment of the hlb dgt and after the retrieval of each set of dgt devices 2 7 field deployment to evaluate the viability of the hlb dgt devices for measuring ncbs in natural waters field deployments were conducted in july 2018 in the black and malodorous jiuxiang river which was a representative source of contamination to the receiving river yangtze river in recent years various persistent organic pollutants i e bisphenols zheng et al 2015 perfluoroalkyl substances guan et al 2018 and pharmaceuticals and personal care products wei et al 2018 have been widely measured in this river details of the sampling site have been described in figure s1 in the field application the hlb dgt devices were stored in containers filled with 0 01 m nacl solutions and transported to the sampling site the devices in sextuplicate were deployed in river water at a depth of 40 cm below the surface for 7 days at the end of the deployment period devices were retrieved and thoroughly rinsed on site with ultrapure water subsequently the retrieved hlb dgt devices were placed in clean bags and transported to the laboratory for sample treatments and gc ecd analysis the ncbs concentrations in water samples were also determined daily using the conventional grab sampling and the spe handling method see supporting information text s5 during the deployment period water quality parameters and precipitation were monitored as shown in figure s2 and table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 assessing adsorption of ncbs on dgt materials fig 1 shows the adsorption efficiencies of ncbs on different dgt materials including moldings abs diffusive gel agarose and five often used filters pes mce ptfe ghp and nl after their exposure to the ncbs solution the average efficiencies for ncbs adsorbed onto abs moldings agarose based diffusive gel pes mce ptfe ghp and nl ranged between 0 31 0 81 2 60 6 06 98 09 98 57 75 28 89 98 0 76 10 85 1 31 6 40 and 4 80 13 84 respectively no measurable adsorption of ncbs to abs moldings 1 and agarose based diffusive gels 6 could be observed which explains the wide use in dgt assemblies for measuring organic compounds such as bisphenols and various drugs zheng et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 similarly ncbs were only slightly adsorbed onto ghp 7 as compared to pes and mce indicating that ghp is more suitable as a filter membrane of dgt a similar result has been reported by zhang et al 2018 who found that the filter could adsorb 30 two organic illicit drugs the result found for pes agrees well with vermeirssen et al 2012 who reported that moderate polar organic compounds accumulate preferentially on pes consequently ghp filters were chosen for use in dgt devices in the following experiments 3 2 diffusion coefficient measurements according to the principle of dgt the accuracy of the dgt measurement is largely determined by the diffusion coefficient chen et al 2012 the diffusion coefficients d cell and d dgt at 25 c of agarose based gels for ncbs are shown in table 1 the values of d cell were 7 20 0 12 10 6 7 44 0 15 10 6 7 49 0 21 10 6 and 7 19 0 21 10 6 cm2 s for mncb pncb oncb and cdnb respectively the average values of d dgt for mncb pncb oncb and cdnb were 7 27 0 37 10 6 7 69 0 39 10 6 7 56 0 37 10 6 and 7 01 0 36 10 6 cm2 s which were similar to d cell with a bias of less than 3 5 consistent values for d cell and d dgt have previously been reported for a number of organic compounds such as bisphenols zheng et al 2015 and perfluoroalkyl substances guan et al 2018 the d cell values of ncbs are comparable to that of 7 6 10 6 cm2 s for methcathinone zhang et al 2018 but much higher than those for bisphenols which range from 4 44 10 6 to 5 64 10 6 cm2 s zheng et al 2015 perfluoroalkyl substances ranging from 4 37 10 6 to 5 08 10 6 cm2 s guan et al 2018 and other tested organic compounds xie et al 2018b these differences are due to the different molecular weights of the chemicals zhang and davison 1999 3 3 uptake and elution efficiencies the rapid binding kinetics of the analytes onto the binding resins satisfies the basic requirements of the dgt methodology which is a prerequisite for dgt performance chen et al 2012 as depicted in fig 2 mncb pncb oncb and cdnb in solutions adsorbed by hlb gels increased linearly within the first 30 min with average binding rates of 16 31 16 48 16 35 and 16 07 ng cm2 min indicating a fast binding of ncbs onto the hlb gels after that more than 97 of the ncbs in the solutions were adsorbed by the hlb gels within 120 min furthermore the flux of mncb pncb oncb and cdnb were 5 24 5 67 5 25 and 4 92 ng cm2 min which were calculated by deploying dgt devices in a well stirred ncbs solution with the same temperature and concentration obviously the average binding rates of the hlb gel for mncb pncb oncb and cdnb were much higher than the flux of dgt this suggests that the concentrations of ncbs at the diffusive gel binding gel interface are effectively zero these results confirm the potential of hlb dgt for the measurement of ncbs as mentioned previously methanol and toluene are considered as effective extractants for eluting a series of organic compounds from the stationary phase in gc based methods dziadas and jelen 2010 zacs et al 2018 in addition methanol has been used to effectively remove the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole bound to xad based binding gels chen et al 2012 accordingly we investigated the extraction ability of these substances for ncbs from hlb gels as shown in figure s3 the average recoveries of ncbs with methanol ranged from 6 70 2 95 to 19 50 1 91 while for toluene 64 93 4 60 to 70 62 4 10 were achieved this is likely to be caused by the more similar values of log kow between ncbs i e mncb 2 46 pncb 2 39 oncb 2 24 and cdnb 2 17 table s1 and toluene 2 73 as compared to methanol 0 77 therefore toluene was chosen as a more effective eluent for ncbs in the remaining experiments quantitative and reproducible recoveries of ncbs from the hlb gels are required for a precise characterization of dgt measured concentrations in aqueous environments the average elution efficiencies of ncbs with higher amounts of toluene and longer periods of ultrasonic extraction increased from 73 24 4 71 to 110 47 0 50 fig 3 however the elution efficiencies of mncb pncb oncb and cdnb increased to 101 98 0 57 104 63 0 44 103 13 0 92 and 110 47 0 50 with 30 min of ultrasonic extraction by 10 ml toluene for two extractions and changed negligibly in the further optimization procedure e g those of 99 84 7 91 103 14 8 04 101 44 7 89 and 107 15 9 68 with 60 min of ultrasonic extraction by 15 ml toluene for three extractions indicating that the optimal extraction level has been reached moreover we also observed good and stable recoveries ranging from 89 81 4 32 to 110 47 0 50 for ncbs across a range of exposure concentrations 0 10 10 mg l figure s4 therefore a combination of 30 min of ultrasonic extraction and 10 ml of toluene for two extractions was selected as the most efficient extraction method in the following experiments 3 4 effects of ph ionic strength and dom on dgt measurement of ncbs the influences of ph ionic strength and concentration of dom on dgt performance for measuring ncbs are presented in fig 4 a the dgt measured concentrations of ncbs cdgt were in good agreement with the directly measured concentrations csolution in deployment solutions with the derived ratios of cdgt csolution ranging from 0 95 to 1 06 at ph levels ranging from 3 05 to 9 08 fig 4a1 indicating that the ph within this range does not affect dgt measurement of ncbs in a previous study hlb dgt performance was independent of ph within the range of 3 5 9 5 in terms of measuring the majority of tested household and personal care products and edcs chen et al 2017 2018 most likely the neutral forms of the tested compounds including ncbs have high retention factors for neutral hlb resins bauerlein et al 2012 this has also been confirmed by li et al 2011 who found that the sampling rate of pocis housing hlb sorbents was relatively constant across the range of ph for neutral species the effect of ionic strength ranging from 0 001 to 0 5 m on the accuracy of ncbs quantification is shown in fig 4a2 the average ratios of cdgt csolution ranged from 0 94 to 1 03 which is within the acceptable limits 1 0 0 1 with the only exception for cdnb whose cdgt csolution value was in the range of 0 85 0 94 this suggests that the uptake of ncbs by hlb dgt is unaffected by ionic strengths from 0 001 to 0 5 m and that dgt can be used in both freshwaters and wastewaters for the monitoring of ncbs these results are in agreement with previous reports for bisphenols using dgt with activated charcoal gels zheng et al 2015 and for edcs using pocis with hlb sorbents zhang et al 2008 as illustrated in fig 4a3 there were good agreements between cdgt and the known concentrations csolution in solutions with dom concentrations ranging from 0 to 20 mg l as indicated by the cdgt csolution ratios which were generally between 0 98 and 1 07 we observed no effect of increased dom concentrations on dgt measurements of ncbs most likely because the diffusion coefficients of dom in agarose gel ranging from 0 9 10 6 to 2 5 10 6 cm2 s lead et al 2003 were much lower than those of ncbs thus resulting in less competition with ncbs for adsorption sites this is consistent with the findings of chen et al 2018 who observed no effects of dom on the uptake of most edcs by hlb dgt 3 5 effect of the dbl on dgt performance when a dgt device is deployed in solution the dbl is formed at the surface of the filter membrane and becomes part of the diffusion layer controlling the molecular diffusion of analytes between the solution and the binding layer davison and zhang 2012 fig 4b shows that the values of the cdgt csolution ratio for all analytes were only around 0 6 under static conditions 0 rpm and 1 0 0 1 under well stirred conditions 250 and 500 rpm under quiescent conditions the dbl thicknesses of mncb 0 59 0 01 mm pncb 0 63 0 03 mm oncb 0 62 0 01 mm and cdnb 0 67 0 02 mm estimated by equation s1 were similar to dbl reported by chen et al 2018 and challis et al 2016 who observed a thickness of 0 76 mm for sulfamethozazole and 0 75 mm for thiamethoxam in unstirred solutions such dbl thicknesses could bring a great error to the dgt measurement if it is ignored however dgt performance is not affected if the solution is moderately stirred with a stirring rate of above 250 rpm therefore in this study the effect of dbl on hlb dgt with a 0 8 mm diffusive gel was ignored for all experiments in test solutions as the stirring rate was normally 600 rpm when hlb dgt devices were applied in unknown environments different thickness of diffusive layers can be used to evaluate the effect of dbl according to equation s2 3 6 time dependence the mass of ncbs accumulated by dgt devices increased linearly with increasing deployment time over 120 h for all four tested chemicals r2 from 0 9918 to 0 9986 figure s5 demonstrating the reliability and stability of sampling using dgt good agreement was observed between calculated theoretical values and measured values indicating that dgt devices equipped with hlb gels are able to measure ncbs concentrations accurately 3 7 dgt capacity to ensure accurate measurement of ncbs using the dgt technique under conditions of high concentrations or long term monitoring a high capacity is essential for the hlb binding gel the mass of ncbs bound onto the hlb gel initially increased linearly with increasing solution concentrations figure s6 and the capacities of the hlb gels were at least 114 65 117 52 117 72 and 37 58 μg cm2 for mncb pncb oncb and cdnb respectively assuming that the dgt devices are deployed for 1 week the maximum concentration of each ncbs in the waters would be at least 818 μg l without exceeding the capacity if the deployment time is 1 month it would be at least 191 μg l however ncbs concentrations were ranged from the ng l level to several ug l in most natural waters he et al 2006 hence the measured binding capacity of hlb dgt is sufficient for monitoring ncbs in waters 3 8 dgt blanks and quantitation limits table 2 summarizes the concentrations of dgt blanks the loqs and the method quantitation limits mqls for ncbs no ncbs were detected in the hlb gels of dgt blanks both in the laboratory and field due to the exceedingly high sensitivity of ecd detectors for halogen elements the loqs of ncbs for gc ecd ranging from 0 18 0 01 to 0 35 0 07 μg l were an order of magnitude lower than those for hplc dad ranging from 16 75 0 36 to 46 80 1 47 μg l based on the loqs of gc ecd for ncbs the average mqls of the isovolume extraction method for water samples in the laboratory and the spe based method ranged between 0 19 0 02 0 30 0 06 μg l and 0 95 0 10 1 50 0 30 ng l respectively the mqls for dgt measured ncbs ranged from 1 46 0 08 to 2 84 0 57 ng l for a deployment time of 7 days 168 h at 25 c which can meet the requirements for the monitoring of ncbs concentrations in natural waters he et al 2006 in waters with ncbs concentrations below the mql a deployment period longer than 168 h and or a diffusive gel layer thinner than 0 80 mm could be applied therefore hlb dgt coupled with gc ecd is suitable for ultra trace analysis of ncbs 3 9 application in the field the present method was firstly tested in environmental samples and the obtained results are presented in fig 5 the concentrations measured using the grab sampling method were ranging from 6 63 0 26 ng l to 187 04 12 73 ng l for mncb 9 92 0 55 ng l to 237 36 15 17 ng l for pncb 7 23 0 50 ng l to 143 88 2 53 ng l for oncb and 4 43 0 29 ng l to 49 29 29 59 ng l for cdnb respectively correspondingly the calculated averaged concentrations for mncb pncb oncb and cdnb were 55 35 69 95 47 65 and 18 10 ng l table s3 while the dgt measured concentrations of mncb pncb oncb and cdnb were 79 15 6 31 80 28 5 45 65 46 5 12 and 33 77 3 62 ng l respectively there is no significant difference between dgt measured concentrations and the calculated averaged concentrations using grab sampling t test p 0 01 text s2 indicating that the results from two methods were comparable obviously with the grab sampling method significant fluctuations in ncbs concentrations were observed during the sampling period which might be caused by the rainfall figure s2 this effect was especially apparent with the heavy rainfall on the sixth day accelerating the mixture of river water rainwater and upstream sewage and or the release of target chemicals from the sediment of the yangshan lake to main river moreover the average ncbs concentrations calculated via the grab sampling method were generally 17 46 less than the dgt measured concentrations table s3 suggesting that the grab sampling method seriously underestimates the average concentrations this underestimation is probably the result of the loss of ncbs during storage transportation and spe enrichment of grab samples in previous studies the deviation of results between grab and passive sampling method were also found for household and personal care products chen et al 2017 and for perfluoroalkyl substances guan et al 2018 in addition the variabilities of dgt measured ncbs concentrations at the same location for the same time were low sd 11 n 6 these findings demonstrated that the quantification of ncbs in natural waters using the hlb dgt method is preferred over the traditional methods for the measurement of ncbs the routine grab sampling method has many limits firstly representative sample is required for the monitoring of micropollutant which is exact weakness of grab samples because of only providing a snapshot of environmental concentration levels novic et al 2017 while the dgt method can easily provide the time weighted average concentrations secondly the volume of grab sample may be insufficient to satisfy the detection limit requirement of commonly used analytical methods for ultratrace ncbs alvarez et al 2005 while hlb dgt can lower the detection limit by in situ preconcentrating ncbs for a long time thirdly much labor and time should be spend on the transport and pretreatment of grab samples resulting in that long term monitoring of contaminants using the grab sampling method is costly for high sampling frequencies especially in remote areas söderström et al 2009 the dgt method is relatively user friendly and cost efficient with a single operation and could save much time on the sample treatment by in situ preconcentration for example the present dgt based method allows continuous measurement of ncbs in aquatic systems possible for any period of time from days weeks and months although a deployment time of 7 days was chosen based on recommendations from other dgt studies zheng et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 different deployment times can be considered based on water quality and contamination levels fourthly high background interference signals were observed during the analysis of grab samples due to the retardation of nanopore size of the diffusive gel layer to larger molecules and selective retention of the hlb gel to ncbs the dgt extracts have the obvious advantages of a cleaner sample matrix less interference and easier analysis the last and most important point due to the semi volatility of ncbs wu et al 2013 the grab sampling method may underestimate the concentrations in aquatic environment when dgt is used ncbs were adsorbed in hlb gel avoiding the loss of ncbs during storage transportation and pretreatment of grab samples therefore hlb dgt shows more advantages than grab sampling method 4 conclusions a new method based on dgt for the measurement of ncbs in natural waters has been developed providing a first insight into in situ passive sampling of ncbs materials required for dgt devices were tested and a suitable filter membrane was selected to ensure the accurate measurement of ncbs by hlb dgt without potential adsorption effects the optimal elution procedure to effectively extract ncbs from hlb gels was developed the diffusion coefficients of ncbs were measured for the first time which is crucial for the calculation of dgt measured concentrations because of the stable performance of dgt under a wide range of environmental conditions i e ph 3 9 ionic strength 0 001 0 5 m dom 0

temperature 23 80 c boundary conditions air or water interface and degasing at 180 c were considered the mtbe diffusivity increased strongly with increasing temperature and it was concluded that a desired water quality can be achieved with proper degasing of the pex pipes as the fem simulations were in excellent agreement with the experimental results the model can accurately predict the mtbe

safety and quality of drinking water is often primarily associated with the source of the water public water supplies groundwater aquifers desalination plants but water quality can also deteriorate during the transport process from the water source to the end user today s water pipes are much less toxic than the lead water pipes used during the height of the roman empire delile blichert toft goiran keay albarède 2014 hernberg 2000 but nevertheless they can still have a negative impact on the final water quality since unhealthy contaminants can still leach from the water pipes into the drinking water the kind of migrating chemicals is mainly determined by the initial pipe material while the concentration of chemicals can be affected by other factors such as water temperature ph pipe dimension and exposure time between water and pipe the ultimate aim of this report is to determine how the migration of undesirable chemicals from polymer based water pipes into drinking water can be cost efficiently minimized polyethylene pe is the most widely used polymer in the world and the installation of pe based water pipes in plumbing applications is steadily increasing globally rabaud and rozental evesque 2008 trew tarbet de rosa ukwir 1995 ukwir 2002 these materials are flexible inexpensive corrosion resistant and have expected service lives greater than 100 years davis et al 2006 in drinking water systems pe based water pipes are installed both in buried distribution systems and in building plumbing a potential concern for the extensive use of pe materials is that organic chemicals can diffuse in out and through pe thereby adversely affecting the quality of drinking and ground water drinking water distribution systems are vulnerable to intentional or unintentional contamination with neat solvents or organic chemicals such that knowledge of the permeation of various chemicals into the polymer pipe is needed to assess the future use of the distribution system clark and deininger 2000 pe based pipes that sorb organic chemicals can also release them into the water or to the ambient air resulting in long term environmental contamination saquing et al 2010 a significant amount of responsibility therefore falls to potable water system managers and designers public health officials and regulators to understand how and why pex pipes can interfere with drinking water quality at the transport stage due to drinking water chemical interactions and variability in resistance to oxidation the aforementioned is all the more important because there is very little that end users who this situation primarily impacts can do to ensure that they are receiving good quality contaminant free drinking water while most chemicals can be found at legal limits scientists still articulate that these could pose long term health risks and complications and in accumulated amounts albeit the european drinking water directive eudwd 1998 has not set strict limits on the majority of drinking water contaminants with the rise of consumerism and the advent of global sustainable development regulations that govern the drinking water quality and are focused toward the presence of migrants in newly produced pex pipes kelley et al 2014 koch 2004 skjevrak et al 2003 will be strengthened in the years to come mercea et al 2018 and it can be in the interest of such businesses to be ahead of the game the development of contaminant fate and transport models can help better establish and reduce the occurrence of pex pipes which do not meet the minimum standards outlined in the dwd set by the european commission for products in contact with drinking water edw 2017 pex pipes either undergo 1 peroxide crosslinking pex a pipe highest crosslinking degree 2 silane crosslinking pex b pipe or 3 electron beam irradiation crosslinking pex c pipe lowest crosslinking degree whelton et al 2010 which causes polymer chains to bond with one another crosslinking improves the ability of pe pipes to resist mechanical failure at elevated temperatures e g improved hot water conveyance with pex connection compared to hdpe pipes unfortunately prior investigators have mainly focused on pe based water pipe interactions with strictly nonpolar compounds mao et al 2010 ong 2008 selleck and marinas 1991 vonk and veenedaal 1983 whelton et al 2010 whelton et al 2011 to date little work has focused on pex pipe water quality impacts and no literature has been found enabling the fate and transport model development with more polar compounds such as tert butyl methyl ether mtbe which is sparingly soluble in water most studies have assumed specific compounds and exposed the pipes to them for modeling their uptakes failing to first establish the fundamentals through directly investigating the chemicals that are migrating from the pipes without human influence ryssel et al 2015 furthermore models have been developed for using neat contaminants and pe materials but no studies or models have yet evaluated mass transfer of low concentration dilute migrants close to the real world situation tang et al 2013 tert butyl methyl ether is one of the primary by products of peroxide crosslinked pe pipes and even though these oxygen containing aliphatic compounds exhibited high solubilities when tested as neat contaminants for their uptake in pex compared to hdpe pipes tang et al 2013 no further reports have been found in literature investigating the transport of the mtbe directly from pex pipes due to the potentially negative effects of mtbe which is responsible for the taste and odour related problems and tba metabolite formation stronger regulations on the maximum allowed concentrations in the tap water at the point of use of the customer are desirable tougher water quality criteria are discussed both in the european union deutsches institut für normung 2005 deutsches institut für normung 2014 federal environment agency 2016 and the united states suffet 2007 usfr 2009 whelton et al 2010 in order to improve the tap water quality and fulfill the water quality regulations increased knowledge and new predictive tools for simulating migration processes in pex water pipes are needed the goal of this work was to enable improved drinking water quality by elucidating the chemical decomposition and migration of peroxide by product in peroxide crosslinked pex pipes the specific objectives were to 1 determine the amount of mtbe in pex pipes as a function of initial concentration time boundary conditions pipe geometry and migration temperature 2 understand the effect of heat treatment degasing on peroxide by product release and finally 3 develop a reliable finite element fem diffusion model which can accurately predict the amount of chemical in the drinking water using experimental migration data both as model input and for validation of the model 2 material and methods 2 1 polymer preparation the polyethylene pipe grade polymer used was hdpe powder having melt flow rate mfr 190 c 21 6 kg of 2 g 10 min and density of 0 954 g cm3 crosslinked pe pex pipes manufactured in accordance with the international quality standard iso 9001 and environmental standard iso 14001 iso 2015 for drinking water use were prepared in 15 2 4 mm 25 3 6 and 32 4 6 mm outer diameter x wall thickness od x wt dimensions the pex pipes had a density of 0 938 g cm3 and peroxide crosslinking degree of approximately 85 2 2 pex characterization tga studies of the samples were conducted using a mettler toledo tg dsc1 instrument pipe samples were carefully cut into small pieces according to the sample holder size with a total weight of 5 10 mg and underwent heating in 70 μl aluminium oxide crucibles from 30 to 850 c at a 10 c min 1 heating rate in nitrogen atmosphere with 50 ml min 1 flow rate a mettler toledo differential scanning calorimeter dsc was used for calorimetric measurements the melting endotherms were determined using 5 10 mg of pipe sample in a covered aluminium pan and nitrogen environment temperature was ramped at a rate of 10 c min 1 from 80 c to 250 c then 250 c to 80 c and then 80 c to 250 c the first heating cycle was used to obtain the melting temperature of each sample 2 3 data collection for model development and validation a combination of two regulatory standards described in the european standard en 12873 parts 1 and 2 deutsches institut für normung 2005 deutsches institut für normung 2014 federal environment agency 2016 and the chinese national standard gb t 17217 1998 the standardization administration of the people s republic of china 1998 were used in the european standard a continuous migration process is used whereby water is stagnant in the pipe for retention times of more than 48 h i e the continuous reaction between the pipe and water can be investigated to better understand compound migration in stagnant water in the chinese standard a successive migration process is employed which mimics a more regular flow manner in this study a combined migration procedure was developed which fulfills both standards four series of migration experiments s1s4 were undertaken in total as outlined in sections 2 3 1 2 3 4 in all of the experiments 1 m long pex pipes were filled with deionized water and the amount of chemical in the stagnant water was each day measured with head space gas chromatography mass spectrometry hs gc ms after which the water was replenished 2 3 1 s1 determination of boundary conditions and starting concentrations the primary aim of the first migration experiment was to examine the boundary conditions at the pipe water and pipe air interfaces one set of pex pipes with 32 mm od and 4 6 mm wt were filled with deionized water and stored at 60 c for 31 days similar to the drinking water testing standards outlined in european standard en 12873 1 2014 deutsches institut für normung 2005 deutsches institut für normung 2014 federal environment agency 2016 the chemical concentration in the stagnant water was measured daily thereafter the water was replenished a second set of pipes which were empty during the first 9 days and then filled with deionized water were treated similarly if the amount of released migrant at a specific day would be the same for both sets of pipes then the boundary condition at the pipe air interface would be effectively identical to the boundary condition at the pipe water interface the resulting data also enabled the determination of chemical starting concentrations and the proportions between di tert butyl peroxide dtbp and mtbe 2 3 2 s2 comparison of migrant concentration with various pipe geometries the second experiment was also together with s1 intended for determining the boundary conditions at the pipe walls this objective was reached by investigating the influence of the pex pipe wall thickness because if a single diffusivity is used to fit experimental data for multiple geometries a good fit between experiments and simulations can only be achieved if the boundary conditions are correct three pipes with 15 25 and 32 mm od and 2 4 3 6 and 4 6 mm wt respectively were used the study was conducted at 60 c for 30 days 2 3 3 s3 influence of the water desorption temperature the aim of the third migration experiment was to determine the migrant diffusivity in the pex pipe wall as a function of water temperature pex pipes with 32 mm od and 4 6 mm wt were used to determine the migration at 23 60 and 80 c respectively for 31 days 2 3 4 s4 influence of heat treatment degasing on migrant diffusion the goal of the fourth migration experiment was to determine the migrant diffusivity in the pex pipe at 180 c to examine if proper degasing of the pipe could be a sufficient strategy for minimizing the chemical concentration in the tap water prior to the study 4 6 mm thick pex pipes were thermally treated in an oven heraeus ae1030 btc9090 with circulated nitrogen at 180 c for a maximum of 15 min in order to determine the effect of degasing time on migrant concentration the samples were heated for 2 8 or 15 min such that the diffusivity d at 180 c could be determined subsequently migration studies were carried out at 60 c the results were additionally used for model validation 2 4 equipment and experimental setup any vials bottles and caps used were washed with concentrated nitric acid sigma aldrich rinsed with deionized water and heated at 180 c for approximately 12 h migration studies were conducted in ovens memmert model 600 or at room temperature on shelves in the laboratory and all pipes were sealed with teflon lined stoppers after filling with 18 2 mω deionized water the water in the pipes was allowed to stand for 24 h sampled thoroughly drained and then refilled with fresh 18 2 mω deionized water immediately this continued for the duration of the experiments for each experiment negative control test samples were prepared by placing deionized water into 50 ml amber glass bottles with teflon lined stoppers and left under identical test conditions as the pex pipe samples 2 5 head space gas chromatography mass spectrometry hs gc ms analysis water samples were collected in 40 ml glass vials with screw caps and stored at 4 c until analysis in preparation of the internal standard is solution d8 toluene was diluted in meoh to obtain a final concentration of 5 43 mg l 1 of this solution 25 μl was introduced into the headspace vials containing 10 ml of sample and the vial was sealed this was done for all analysed samples including blank solutions and those used for obtaining calibration curves for each target substance the analytes were quantified by hs gc ms on a headspace sampler agilent 7697a with a 1 ml sample loop and 0 2 mm uncoated fused silica transfer line coupled to agilent 7890a gc and 5975c ms systems prepared samples were placed into a 10 ml glass screw top vial with polytetrafluoroethylene silicone septa evenly mixed and allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at 30 c analytes were exposed to the sample headspace for 30 min and the evolved gases were injected into the gc ms injection port where analysis took place the transfer lines from the hs to the interface and from the interface to the gc were set at 110 c and the sampling frequency was 20 s 1 all gc ms injections were performed with a 5 1 split ratio a rxi 624sil ms restek 13872 capillary column 60 m 320 μm i d x 1 8 μm film thickness was used silarylene was used as the stationary phase at a maximum temperature of 300 c splitless mode helium was used as carrier gas in the pressure control mode to ensure a column flow of 1 0 ml min 1 the gc oven temperature program consisted of an isothermal step at temperature 30 c for 5 min then raised at 20 c min 1 to 300 c and held for 30 min ionization was effectuated by electron impact ei at 70 ev and an electron multiplier voltage emv of 1 was used the ms transfer line and oven temperatures were set to 280 and 150 c respectively the ion source temperatures were 250 c and manifold temperature was 40 c all analyses were performed in triplicate the compounds in the gc ms total ion chromatogram tic were identified using nist epa nih mass spectral library 2011 qualitative analysis of the constituents was based on comparison of the obtained mass spectra with those of reference compounds in the nist mass spectral search program nist version 2 0 in scouting experiments the acquisition was performed in full scan mode in the 29 to 200 mass to charge ratio m z range in the final optimized method the acquisition was in selected ion monitoring sim mode and dtbp 57 and 146 m z and mtbe 57 and 73 m z were quickly identified calibration standards dtbp luperox di 98 and mtbe anhydrous 99 8 were obtained from sigma aldrich calibration curves were prepared for the two compounds all standards were prepared and concentrated using the same is solution as previously described for the samples all results were fit to the calibration curve and normalized to the is during data processing for each substance the calibration range limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq in the hs gc ms method were as follows dtbp calibration range 0 01 0 23 μg l lod 0 01 μg l loq 0 03 μg l mtbe calibration range 0 7 73 μg l lod 1 0 μg l loq 3 1 μg l 2 6 fem model development finite element modeling fem with comsol multiphysics supplemented with matlab was used to compute the migrant concentration in the pex pipe and in the water as a function of time the pipe geometry was defined using the inner radius ra the outer radius rb and the pipe segment length l due to the cylindrical symmetry and the high aspect ratio of the pex pipe segments the three dimensional 3d pipe geometry could be simplified to a one dimensional 1d problem in cylindrical coordinates the diffusion equation which describes the diffusion through the pex pipe then became 1 cp ipe t 1 r r rd t cp ipe r where cpipe is the migrant concentration in the pex pipe t is the time t is the temperature and r is the radial position in the pipe crank 1975 as a starting condition it was defined that the boundary condition bc be useopenouterbc 1 where 0 denotes that the change in concentration over time is equal to 0 that is 0 dcpipe bc dt 0 and 1 denotes that only the initial concentration at the boundaries inner and outer pipe radius sides is equal to 0 that is 1 cpipe 0 bc 0 furthermore the initial conditions also assume that the migrating substance is uniformly distributed throughout the pex pipe layer that is cpipe cpipe 0 for 0 x l where l is the wall thickness the diffusion coefficient d t which depend on both temperature t and the choice of migrant chemical adams et al 2011 was determined by fitting the model to the results of migration experiments s1s4 due to the low chemical concentration the diffusivity was considered concentration independent in the model the initial concentration cpipe 0 was determined from the experiments because of the simple cylindrical 1d pipe geometry an equidistant mesh with 1 10 3 mm mesh elements was used the storage time between pipe production and experiments was accounted for in the model once the pipe concentration was computed as a function of t days the concentration in the surrounding water was computed as follows considering that the water was refreshed every day 2 mpipe t cpipe t vpipe 3 mwater t mpipe 0 mpipe t 4 mrefreshedwater t mwater t 1 mwater t 5 crefreshedwater t mrefreshedwater t vwater where mpipe is the migrant mass in the pipe as calculated by numerical integration of the concentration cpipe over the pipe volume vp ipe vwater is the volume of the water crefreshedwater is the concentration in the refreshed water and mwater and mrefreshedwater are the accumulated masses of migrants in water and refreshed water respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 physics of migration in pex pipes the process of migration from the pipe to the water depends on the properties of both the polymer and the migrating compounds and also on the migrant concentration in the water phase such that the driving force decreases with saturation table 1 presents the weight loss percentages of pe based materials as well as the melting temperatures tm and degradation temperatures tdeg derived from the tga data where the weight loss rate of sample was given as a function of temperature the process of crosslinking pe showed a particularly strong impact such that the thermal stability shown by increased temperatures at which weight loss occurred was notably enhanced in pex pipes compared to the neat pe powder and the pe ao resin the presence of crosslinks notably shifted the onset of thermal degradation toward higher temperatures than the neat pe neat pe powder and pe ao resin generally exhibited the least thermal stability as they rapidly decomposed from t10 to t90 due to the absence of crosslinking networks conforming a more stable pe structure the onset of thermal decomposition of all crosslinked pipes occurred at higher temperatures compared to those of the neat pe powder and pe ao resin supporting the stable nature of the peroxide crosslinking process for inferring thermal stability to pe pipes and resistance towards the onset of thermal degradation the melting point of the crosslinked material was lower than the uncrosslinked material indicating thinner crystals in the former non heat treated pex pipes possessed as expected similar thermal stabilities regardless of pipe wall thickness as temperature increased overall thermal analysis revealed small differences in degradation temperature and its onset between non heat treated and heat treated pex samples but greater differences between un crosslinked and crosslinked samples degasing via heat treatment had no visible effect on the thermal stability of the pex pipes thereby demonstrating that heat treatment of pex pipes does not significantly compromise their thermal integrity table 2 provides physicochemical properties of the migrants investigated in this study since mtbe is moderately miscible in water this molecule is expected to be present in higher concentrations in the water phase than dtbp further compounding this effect the molar volume decreases in the order of dtbp mtbe the migration rate is expected to increase with decreasing molecule size since small compounds more easily penetrate the pex structure furthermore if these compounds are low polar or nonpolar high compatibility and high solubilities are to be expected in pex pipes since they are nonpolar if both the molecular size and the dipole moment are similar for the substances then the determining factor becomes the octanol water kow or the hexadecane water phexadacane water partition coefficient however while log kow is generally used throughout polymer research as a good proxy to assess chemical hydrophobicity and ability to stay in the pex polymer and out of the water phase tang et al 2013 octanol contains a polar hydroxyl moiety which is able to interact with polar molecules such as mtbe hale et al 2010 as such the hexadecane water partition coefficient estimated in this work using the commercial quantum chemical software cosmotherm is a better measure of hydrophobicity when interactions with pe are studied the higher the log kow or log phexadecane water the higher the hydrophobicity the properties of the migrating compounds have a direct influence on diffusivity values whelton et al 2010 and are therefore as important as the molecular mobility of the polymer chains millet et al 2016 considering the full migrant properties presented migrant concentration in the water during the studies is expected to increase in the order of dtbp mtbe in this work the proposed fem diffusion model considers that mtbe is a dtbp by product as exemplified in fig 1 the basic model parameters such as initial concentrations and diffusion coefficients were obtained from experimental data and where possible compared to expected values furthermore the relationship between the model parameters and the physicochemical characteristics of the compounds were analysed in order to determine their influence on the observed migration profiles 3 2 diffusion results for experiments and simulations in order to use the fem diffusion model for predicting the migrant concentration in contact with the water as function of time the boundary conditions starting concentrations and temperature dependent diffusivity had to be determined migration experiments s1 and s2 which examined the effect of having the pipe in contact with air or water and the effect of changing pipe dimension were used to evaluate the initial and boundary conditions described in section 2 6 s1 was also used for determining the starting concentration in the pipe while s3 and s4 were used to examine the temperature dependence of d and the effect of degasing the pipes respectively the diffusion simulations were run in two steps one for the degasing and storage phase and one corresponding to the conditions during the migration experiments 3 2 1 determination of boundary conditions and starting concentrations s1 in fig 2 the data collected during migration study s1 is summarized showing the concentration of migrants in the water refreshed daily versus time as predicted in section 3 1 the mtbe concentration was highest 100 μg l and the dtbp concentration lowest 1 μg l the mtbe concentration pattern showed a linear decrease in concentration of roughly one magnitude over 31 days in log linear scale due to the low concentration of dtbp it was difficult to assess its migration characteristics with hs gcms however the focus in this work was the analysis of mtbe data at 60 c the results for the initially empty pipes fig 2a were almost identical to the results for the continuously water filled pipes fig 2b indicating that the boundary conditions at the pipe air and pipe water interfaces were effectively identical the proportion of mtbe formation from dtbp decomposition was observed and included in the fem model 3 2 2 comparison of migrant concentration at various pipe geometries s2 in fig 3 the results of experiment s2 are summarized in three plots showing mtbe concentration versus time for three different pipe dimensions od 15 25 and 32 mm wt 2 4 3 6 and 4 6 mm the migrant concentration in the refreshed water always decreased with time with the decrease being more pronounced with decreasing pipe wall thickness this result is expected since the size of the migrant reservoir increases with the volume of the pipe and thus also with the pipe thickness since study s1 indicated that the pipe air and the pipe water boundary conditions were identical one single d would be sufficient to fit all mtbe data in fig 3 assuming correct boundary conditions optimal fitting as shown with curves in fig 3 was achieved by setting the concentrations to zero at both pipe surfaces the boundary conditions are reasonable considering the comparatively large volume of the water reservoir the daily refreshing of the water and the extremely slow diffusion inside the pipe wall as compared to the diffusivity in the water hence the migration of mtbe was characterized as a process limited by its diffusion properties in the pipe a diffusion controlled process the fit yielded an mtbe diffusivity of d 60 c 1 5 10 12 m2 s 3 2 3 influence of water desorption temperature s3 the results of migration experiment s3 are shown in fig 4 where the concentration of mtbe in the refreshed water is plotted versus time for each migration temperature when the water temperature was raised the initial mtbe concentration in the water subsequently increased while the final concentration decreased after 30 days the mtbe concentration had decreased 8 times at 30 c and 280 times at 80 c these trends are explained by the expected increase in migrant diffusivity with increasing temperature refer to s3 values in table 3 3 2 4 influence of heat treatment on migrant diffusion s4 fig 5 concludes the results of migration experiment s4 where the effect of degasing at 180 c was considered the concentration of mtbe in refreshed water was plotted against time for 4 6 mm thick pex pipes which had been heated at 180 c for 2 8 and 15 min after degasing the standard migration experiments were performed at 60 c the curves maintained a similar downward shift with increasing time from 2 to 15 min the mtbe concentration decreased with degasing and values remained within the same range of 99 3 μg l by the end of migration day 21 regardless of degasing time suggesting that 2 min was sufficient to achieve a reduction in the initial migrant concentration from 551 μg l in s3 reference 4 6 mm wt pipe 60 c migration to 355 μg l after degasing using this experimental data the fem model was used to compute the mtbe diffusivity during both the degasing and migration processes mtbe diffusivity during the degasing treatment at 180 c d 180 c was 1 10 9 m2 s while diffusivity during the migration period d 60 c was 0 8 10 9 m2 s in good agreement with migration studies conducted throughout experiments s1s3 while an official health based guideline value has not been derived for mtbe it should be noted that in four studies the geometric mean detection threshold and as such the recommended taste and odour thresholds of mtbe in drinking water varies from 24 to 135 μg l and 15 180 μg l respectively who 2005 whereas the european commission states a threshold of 15 μg l ec 2001 specifically in the us the primary drinking water standards for mtbe vary from state to state and range from 10 to 240 μg l neiwpcc 2003 while the health advisory range for organoleptic taste and odour effects suggested by the u s environmental protection agency epa were 20 μg l 40 μg l epa 2008 it is evident that mtbe threshold values vary and this must be acknowledged since degasing conditions should be chosen to meet the specific regional national threshold values it should also be acknowledged that complicating factors e g disinfectant residuals biofilm and scale presence and water flow velocity in real water distribution systems can influence the aging and degradation of pex pipes dear and mason 2006 whelton and dietrich 2009 colin et al 2009a 2009b while these factors are beyond the aims of the present work their influence may be explored in future work as an extension to this study providing a wholestic tool which benefits both pipe manufacturers and drinking water sectors 3 2 5 summary of the diffusion results table 3 summarizes the mtbe diffusivities in pex from experiments s1 s4 diffusivities were computed by fitting the developed fem model to the experimental desorption data of figs 3 and 4 using a zero boundary mtbe concentration typical concentration profiles were as shown in fig 6 essentially all diffusivities from the s1 and s2 experiments were identical confirming the correctness of using zero concentration boundary conditions and considering a diffusion controlled migration process the computed diffusivity d 60 c 1 5 10 12 m2 s was close to a previously reported diffusivity 2 0 10 12 m2 s corrected for temperature using the piringer s model crompton 2007 it was also shown that d increases as expected with increasing migration temperature in the range 30 80 c for mtbe s3 the diffusivities between the different degasing times were desirably consistent since d 60 c only decreased slightly with degasing treatment s4 it can be concluded that d was at least not strongly concentration dependent as suggested in previous studies adams et al 2011 for any migration curve a reduction in the starting concentration c0 will thus result in a reduced final concentration with exactly the same factor consequently one of the most cost effective ways to reduce the chemical emissions from pex pipes is to reduce c0 through degasing of the pipes to conclude the fem diffusion model can now accurately predict the migrant concentration in drinking water as function of pipe geometry and migration temperature the model can thus be used as a valuable tool for minimizing the amounts of chemicals migrating from pex pipes into tap water 4 conclusions a combined experimental and simulation strategy was used for predicting the migration of chemicals from peroxide crosslinked water pipes into drinking water the decomposition product mtbe from the common dtbp peroxide crosslinking of pe was focused on in this study physical properties of pex pipes were determined with tga and dsc while hs gc ms was used to measure the concentration of chemicals in the drinking water as a function of time the experimental migration results were reasonable considering the physical properties of the compounds a fem diffusion model was developed for analyzing the migration providing predictions in good agreement with experimental migration validation data proper boundary conditions initial concentrations partitioning coefficients and temperature dependent diffusion coefficients were established by fitting the fem model to experimental results of tailor made migration experiments assuming an even distribution of migrants along the length of the pipe the model can accurately predict the concentration of chemicals in tap water as a function of time migration temperature and pex pipe geometry degasing was found to be an efficient strategy for reducing the migrant concentration in the pex pipes and the model can already be used for predicting ideal degasing times although complementary degasing experiments will be needed for computing d t over the whole temperature range of relevance and for additional validation of the model due to the prediction power of the new fem diffusion model the results of this study can enable pex pipe producers to optimize their production processes ultimately playing their part in ensuring a desirable water quality and an augmented

drinking water systems pe based water pipes are installed both in buried distribution systems and in building plumbing a potential concern for the extensive use of pe materials is that organic chemicals can diffuse in out and through pe thereby adversely affecting the quality of drinking and ground water drinking water distribution systems are vulnerable to intentional or unintentional contamination with neat solvents or organic chemicals such that knowledge of the permeation of various chemicals into the polymer pipe is needed to assess the future use of the distribution system clark and deininger 2000 pe based pipes that sorb organic chemicals can also release them into the water or to the ambient air resulting in long term environmental contamination saquing et al 2010 a significant amount of responsibility therefore falls to potable water system managers and designers public health officials and regulators to understand how and why pex pipes can interfere with drinking water quality at the transport stage due to drinking water chemical interactions and variability in resistance to oxidation the aforementioned is all the more important because there is very little that end users who this situation primarily impacts can do to ensure that they are receiving good quality contaminant free drinking water while most chemicals can be found at legal limits scientists still articulate that these could pose long term health risks and complications and in accumulated amounts albeit the european drinking water directive eudwd 1998 has not set strict limits on the majority of drinking water contaminants with the rise of consumerism and the advent of global sustainable development regulations that govern the drinking water quality and are focused toward the presence of migrants in newly produced pex pipes kelley et al 2014 koch 2004 skjevrak et al 2003 will be strengthened in the years to come mercea et al 2018 and it can be in the interest of such businesses to be ahead of the game the development of contaminant fate and transport models can help better establish and reduce the occurrence of pex pipes which do not meet the minimum standards outlined in the dwd set by the european commission for products in contact with drinking water edw 2017 pex pipes either undergo 1 peroxide crosslinking pex a pipe highest crosslinking degree 2 silane crosslinking pex b pipe or 3 electron beam irradiation crosslinking pex c pipe lowest crosslinking degree whelton et al 2010 which causes polymer chains to bond with one another crosslinking improves the ability of pe pipes to resist mechanical failure at elevated temperatures e g improved hot water conveyance with pex connection compared to hdpe pipes unfortunately prior investigators have mainly focused on pe based water pipe interactions with strictly nonpolar compounds mao et al 2010 ong 2008 selleck and marinas 1991 vonk and veenedaal 1983 whelton et al 2010 whelton et al 2011 to date little work has focused on pex pipe water quality impacts and no literature has been found enabling the fate and transport model development with more polar compounds such as tert butyl methyl ether mtbe which is sparingly soluble in water most studies have assumed specific compounds and exposed the pipes to them for modeling their uptakes failing to first establish the fundamentals through directly investigating the chemicals that are migrating from the pipes without human influence ryssel et al 2015 furthermore models have been developed for using neat contaminants and pe materials but no studies or models have yet evaluated mass transfer of low concentration dilute migrants close to the real world situation tang et al 2013 tert butyl methyl ether is one of the primary by products of peroxide crosslinked pe pipes and even though these oxygen containing aliphatic compounds exhibited high solubilities when tested as neat contaminants for their uptake in pex compared to hdpe pipes tang et al 2013 no further reports have been found in literature investigating the transport of the mtbe directly from pex pipes due to the potentially negative effects of mtbe which is responsible for the taste and odour related problems and tba metabolite formation stronger regulations on the maximum allowed concentrations in the tap water at the point of use of the customer are desirable tougher water quality criteria are discussed both in the european union deutsches institut für normung 2005 deutsches institut für normung 2014 federal environment agency 2016 and the united states suffet 2007 usfr 2009 whelton et al 2010 in order to improve the tap water quality and fulfill the water quality regulations increased knowledge and new predictive tools for simulating migration processes in pex water pipes are needed the goal of this work was to enable improved drinking water quality by elucidating the chemical decomposition and migration of peroxide by product in peroxide crosslinked pex pipes the specific objectives were to 1 determine the amount of mtbe in pex pipes as a function of initial concentration time boundary conditions pipe geometry and migration temperature 2 understand the effect of heat treatment degasing on peroxide by product release and finally 3 develop a reliable finite element fem diffusion model which can accurately predict the amount of chemical in the drinking water using experimental migration data both as model input and for validation of the model 2 material and methods 2 1 polymer preparation the polyethylene pipe grade polymer used was hdpe powder having melt flow rate mfr 190 c 21 6 kg of 2 g 10 min and density of 0 954 g cm3 crosslinked pe pex pipes manufactured in accordance with the international quality standard iso 9001 and environmental standard iso 14001 iso 2015 for drinking water use were prepared in 15 2 4 mm 25 3 6 and 32 4 6 mm outer diameter x wall thickness od x wt dimensions the pex pipes had a density of 0 938 g cm3 and peroxide crosslinking degree of approximately 85 2 2 pex characterization tga studies of the samples were conducted using a mettler toledo tg dsc1 instrument pipe samples were carefully cut into small pieces according to the sample holder size with a total weight of 5 10 mg and underwent heating in 70 μl aluminium oxide crucibles from 30 to 850 c at a 10 c min 1 heating rate in nitrogen atmosphere with 50 ml min 1 flow rate a mettler toledo differential scanning calorimeter dsc was used for calorimetric measurements the melting endotherms were determined using 5 10 mg of pipe sample in a covered aluminium pan and nitrogen environment temperature was ramped at a rate of 10 c min 1 from 80 c to 250 c then 250 c to 80 c and then 80 c to 250 c the first heating cycle was used to obtain the melting temperature of each sample 2 3 data collection for model development and validation a combination of two regulatory standards described in the european standard en 12873 parts 1 and 2 deutsches institut für normung 2005 deutsches institut für normung 2014 federal environment agency 2016 and the chinese national standard gb t 17217 1998 the standardization administration of the people s republic of china 1998 were used in the european standard a continuous migration process is used whereby water is stagnant in the pipe for retention times of more than 48 h i e the continuous reaction between the pipe and water can be investigated to better understand compound migration in stagnant water in the chinese standard a successive migration process is employed which mimics a more regular flow manner in this study a combined migration procedure was developed which fulfills both standards four series of migration experiments s1s4 were undertaken in total as outlined in sections 2 3 1 2 3 4 in all of the experiments 1 m long pex pipes were filled with deionized water and the amount of chemical in the stagnant water was each day measured with head space gas chromatography mass spectrometry hs gc ms after which the water was replenished 2 3 1 s1 determination of boundary conditions and starting concentrations the primary aim of the first migration experiment was to examine the boundary conditions at the pipe water and pipe air interfaces one set of pex pipes with 32 mm od and 4 6 mm wt were filled with deionized water and stored at 60 c for 31 days similar to the drinking water testing standards outlined in european standard en 12873 1 2014 deutsches institut für normung 2005 deutsches institut für normung 2014 federal environment agency 2016 the chemical concentration in the stagnant water was measured daily thereafter the water was replenished a second set of pipes which were empty during the first 9 days and then filled with deionized water were treated similarly if the amount of released migrant at a specific day would be the same for both sets of pipes then the boundary condition at the pipe air interface would be effectively identical to the boundary condition at the pipe water interface the resulting data also enabled the determination of chemical starting concentrations and the proportions between di tert butyl peroxide dtbp and mtbe 2 3 2 s2 comparison of migrant concentration with various pipe geometries the second experiment was also together with s1 intended for determining the boundary conditions at the pipe walls this objective was reached by investigating the influence of the pex pipe wall thickness because if a single diffusivity is used to fit experimental data for multiple geometries a good fit between experiments and simulations can only be achieved if the boundary conditions are correct three pipes with 15 25 and 32 mm od and 2 4 3 6 and 4 6 mm wt respectively were used the study was conducted at 60 c for 30 days 2 3 3 s3 influence of the water desorption temperature the aim of the third migration experiment was to determine the migrant diffusivity in the pex pipe wall as a function of water temperature pex pipes with 32 mm od and 4 6 mm wt were used to determine the migration at 23 60 and 80 c respectively for 31 days 2 3 4 s4 influence of heat treatment degasing on migrant diffusion the goal of the fourth migration experiment was to determine the migrant diffusivity in the pex pipe at 180 c to examine if proper degasing of the pipe could be a sufficient strategy for minimizing the chemical concentration in the tap water prior to the study 4 6 mm thick pex pipes were thermally treated in an oven heraeus ae1030 btc9090 with circulated nitrogen at 180 c for a maximum of 15 min in order to determine the effect of degasing time on migrant concentration the samples were heated for 2 8 or 15 min such that the diffusivity d at 180 c could be determined subsequently migration studies were carried out at 60 c the results were additionally used for model validation 2 4 equipment and experimental setup any vials bottles and caps used were washed with concentrated nitric acid sigma aldrich rinsed with deionized water and heated at 180 c for approximately 12 h migration studies were conducted in ovens memmert model 600 or at room temperature on shelves in the laboratory and all pipes were sealed with teflon lined stoppers after filling with 18 2 mω deionized water the water in the pipes was allowed to stand for 24 h sampled thoroughly drained and then refilled with fresh 18 2 mω deionized water immediately this continued for the duration of the experiments for each experiment negative control test samples were prepared by placing deionized water into 50 ml amber glass bottles with teflon lined stoppers and left under identical test conditions as the pex pipe samples 2 5 head space gas chromatography mass spectrometry hs gc ms analysis water samples were collected in 40 ml glass vials with screw caps and stored at 4 c until analysis in preparation of the internal standard is solution d8 toluene was diluted in meoh to obtain a final concentration of 5 43 mg l 1 of this solution 25 μl was introduced into the headspace vials containing 10 ml of sample and the vial was sealed this was done for all analysed samples including blank solutions and those used for obtaining calibration curves for each target substance the analytes were quantified by hs gc ms on a headspace sampler agilent 7697a with a 1 ml sample loop and 0 2 mm uncoated fused silica transfer line coupled to agilent 7890a gc and 5975c ms systems prepared samples were placed into a 10 ml glass screw top vial with polytetrafluoroethylene silicone septa evenly mixed and allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at 30 c analytes were exposed to the sample headspace for 30 min and the evolved gases were injected into the gc ms injection port where analysis took place the transfer lines from the hs to the interface and from the interface to the gc were set at 110 c and the sampling frequency was 20 s 1 all gc ms injections were performed with a 5 1 split ratio a rxi 624sil ms restek 13872 capillary column 60 m 320 μm i d x 1 8 μm film thickness was used silarylene was used as the stationary phase at a maximum temperature of 300 c splitless mode helium was used as carrier gas in the pressure control mode to ensure a column flow of 1 0 ml min 1 the gc oven temperature program consisted of an isothermal step at temperature 30 c for 5 min then raised at 20 c min 1 to 300 c and held for 30 min ionization was effectuated by electron impact ei at 70 ev and an electron multiplier voltage emv of 1 was used the ms transfer line and oven temperatures were set to 280 and 150 c respectively the ion source temperatures were 250 c and manifold temperature was 40 c all analyses were performed in triplicate the compounds in the gc ms total ion chromatogram tic were identified using nist epa nih mass spectral library 2011 qualitative analysis of the constituents was based on comparison of the obtained mass spectra with those of reference compounds in the nist mass spectral search program nist version 2 0 in scouting experiments the acquisition was performed in full scan mode in the 29 to 200 mass to charge ratio m z range in the final optimized method the acquisition was in selected ion monitoring sim mode and dtbp 57 and 146 m z and mtbe 57 and 73 m z were quickly identified calibration standards dtbp luperox di 98 and mtbe anhydrous 99 8 were obtained from sigma aldrich calibration curves were prepared for the two compounds all standards were prepared and concentrated using the same is solution as previously described for the samples all results were fit to the calibration curve and normalized to the is during data processing for each substance the calibration range limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq in the hs gc ms method were as follows dtbp calibration range 0 01 0 23 μg l lod 0 01 μg l loq 0 03 μg l mtbe calibration range 0 7 73 μg l lod 1 0 μg l loq 3 1 μg l 2 6 fem model development finite element modeling fem with comsol multiphysics supplemented with matlab was used to compute the migrant concentration in the pex pipe and in the water as a function of time the pipe geometry was defined using the inner radius ra the outer radius rb and the pipe segment length l due to the cylindrical symmetry and the high aspect ratio of the pex pipe segments the three dimensional 3d pipe geometry could be simplified to a one dimensional 1d problem in cylindrical coordinates the diffusion equation which describes the diffusion through the pex pipe then became 1 cp ipe t 1 r r rd t cp ipe r where cpipe is the migrant concentration in the pex pipe t is the time t is the temperature and r is the radial position in the pipe crank 1975 as a starting condition it was defined that the boundary condition bc be useopenouterbc 1 where 0 denotes that the change in concentration over time is equal to 0 that is 0 dcpipe bc dt 0 and 1 denotes that only the initial concentration at the boundaries inner and outer pipe radius sides is equal to 0 that is 1 cpipe 0 bc 0 furthermore the initial conditions also assume that the migrating substance is uniformly distributed throughout the pex pipe layer that is cpipe cpipe 0 for 0 x l where l is the wall thickness the diffusion coefficient d t which depend on both temperature t and the choice of migrant chemical adams et al 2011 was determined by fitting the model to the results of migration experiments s1s4 due to the low chemical concentration the diffusivity was considered concentration independent in the model the initial concentration cpipe 0 was determined from the experiments because of the simple cylindrical 1d pipe geometry an equidistant mesh with 1 10 3 mm mesh elements was used the storage time between pipe production and experiments was accounted for in the model once the pipe concentration was computed as a function of t days the concentration in the surrounding water was computed as follows considering that the water was refreshed every day 2 mpipe t cpipe t vpipe 3 mwater t mpipe 0 mpipe t 4 mrefreshedwater t mwater t 1 mwater t 5 crefreshedwater t mrefreshedwater t vwater where mpipe is the migrant mass in the pipe as calculated by numerical integration of the concentration cpipe over the pipe volume vp ipe vwater is the volume of the water crefreshedwater is the concentration in the refreshed water and mwater and mrefreshedwater are the accumulated masses of migrants in water and refreshed water respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 physics of migration in pex pipes the process of migration from the pipe to the water depends on the properties of both the polymer and the migrating compounds and also on the migrant concentration in the water phase such that the driving force decreases with saturation table 1 presents the weight loss percentages of pe based materials as well as the melting temperatures tm and degradation temperatures tdeg derived from the tga data where the weight loss rate of sample was given as a function of temperature the process of crosslinking pe showed a particularly strong impact such that the thermal stability shown by increased temperatures at which weight loss occurred was notably enhanced in pex pipes compared to the neat pe powder and the pe ao resin the presence of crosslinks notably shifted the onset of thermal degradation toward higher temperatures than the neat pe neat pe powder and pe ao resin generally exhibited the least thermal stability as they rapidly decomposed from t10 to t90 due to the absence of crosslinking networks conforming a more stable pe structure the onset of thermal decomposition of all crosslinked pipes occurred at higher temperatures compared to those of the neat pe powder and pe ao resin supporting the stable nature of the peroxide crosslinking process for inferring thermal stability to pe pipes and resistance towards the onset of thermal degradation the melting point of the crosslinked material was lower than the uncrosslinked material indicating thinner crystals in the former non heat treated pex pipes possessed as expected similar thermal stabilities regardless of pipe wall thickness as temperature increased overall thermal analysis revealed small differences in degradation temperature and its onset between non heat treated and heat treated pex samples but greater differences between un crosslinked and crosslinked samples degasing via heat treatment had no visible effect on the thermal stability of the pex pipes thereby demonstrating that heat treatment of pex pipes does not significantly compromise their thermal integrity table 2 provides physicochemical properties of the migrants investigated in this study since mtbe is moderately miscible in water this molecule is expected to be present in higher concentrations in the water phase than dtbp further compounding this effect the molar volume decreases in the order of dtbp mtbe the migration rate is expected to increase with decreasing molecule size since small compounds more easily penetrate the pex structure furthermore if these compounds are low polar or nonpolar high compatibility and high solubilities are to be expected in pex pipes since they are nonpolar if both the molecular size and the dipole moment are similar for the substances then the determining factor becomes the octanol water kow or the hexadecane water phexadacane water partition coefficient however while log kow is generally used throughout polymer research as a good proxy to assess chemical hydrophobicity and ability to stay in the pex polymer and out of the water phase tang et al 2013 octanol contains a polar hydroxyl moiety which is able to interact with polar molecules such as mtbe hale et al 2010 as such the hexadecane water partition coefficient estimated in this work using the commercial quantum chemical software cosmotherm is a better measure of hydrophobicity when interactions with pe are studied the higher the log kow or log phexadecane water the higher the hydrophobicity the properties of the migrating compounds have a direct influence on diffusivity values whelton et al 2010 and are therefore as important as the molecular mobility of the polymer chains millet et al 2016 considering the full migrant properties presented migrant concentration in the water during the studies is expected to increase in the order of dtbp mtbe in this work the proposed fem diffusion model considers that mtbe is a dtbp by product as exemplified in fig 1 the basic model parameters such as initial concentrations and diffusion coefficients were obtained from experimental data and where possible compared to expected values furthermore the relationship between the model parameters and the physicochemical characteristics of the compounds were analysed in order to determine their influence on the observed migration profiles 3 2 diffusion results for experiments and simulations in order to use the fem diffusion model for predicting the migrant concentration in contact with the water as function of time the boundary conditions starting concentrations and temperature dependent diffusivity had to be determined migration experiments s1 and s2 which examined the effect of having the pipe in contact with air or water and the effect of changing pipe dimension were used to evaluate the initial and boundary conditions described in section 2 6 s1 was also used for determining the starting concentration in the pipe while s3 and s4 were used to examine the temperature dependence of d and the effect of degasing the pipes respectively the diffusion simulations were run in two steps one for the degasing and storage phase and one corresponding to the conditions during the migration experiments 3 2 1 determination of boundary conditions and starting concentrations s1 in fig 2 the data collected during migration study s1 is summarized showing the concentration of migrants in the water refreshed daily versus time as predicted in section 3 1 the mtbe concentration was highest 100 μg l and the dtbp concentration lowest 1 μg l the mtbe concentration pattern showed a linear decrease in concentration of roughly one magnitude over 31 days in log linear scale due to the low concentration of dtbp it was difficult to assess its migration characteristics with hs gcms however the focus in this work was the analysis of mtbe data at 60 c the results for the initially empty pipes fig 2a were almost identical to the results for the continuously water filled pipes fig 2b indicating that the boundary conditions at the pipe air and pipe water interfaces were effectively identical the proportion of mtbe formation from dtbp decomposition was observed and included in the fem model 3 2 2 comparison of migrant concentration at various pipe geometries s2 in fig 3 the results of experiment s2 are summarized in three plots showing mtbe concentration versus time for three different pipe dimensions od 15 25 and 32 mm wt 2 4 3 6 and 4 6 mm the migrant concentration in the refreshed water always decreased with time with the decrease being more pronounced with decreasing pipe wall thickness this result is expected since the size of the migrant reservoir increases with the volume of the pipe and thus also with the pipe thickness since study s1 indicated that the pipe air and the pipe water boundary conditions were identical one single d would be sufficient to fit all mtbe data in fig 3 assuming correct boundary conditions optimal fitting as shown with curves in fig 3 was achieved by setting the concentrations to zero at both pipe surfaces the boundary conditions are reasonable considering the comparatively large volume of the water reservoir the daily refreshing of the water and the extremely slow diffusion inside the pipe wall as compared to the diffusivity in the water hence the migration of mtbe was characterized as a process limited by its diffusion properties in the pipe a diffusion controlled process the fit yielded an mtbe diffusivity of d 60 c 1 5 10 12 m2 s 3 2 3 influence of water desorption temperature s3 the results of migration experiment s3 are shown in fig 4 where the concentration of mtbe in the refreshed water is plotted versus time for each migration temperature when the water temperature was raised the initial mtbe concentration in the water subsequently increased while the final concentration decreased after 30 days the mtbe concentration had decreased 8 times at 30 c and 280 times at 80 c these trends are explained by the expected increase in migrant diffusivity with increasing temperature refer to s3 values in table 3 3 2 4 influence of heat treatment on migrant diffusion s4 fig 5 concludes the results of migration experiment s4 where the effect of degasing at 180 c was considered the concentration of mtbe in refreshed water was plotted against time for 4 6 mm thick pex pipes which had been heated at 180 c for 2 8 and 15 min after degasing the standard migration experiments were performed at 60 c the curves maintained a similar downward shift with increasing time from 2 to 15 min the mtbe concentration decreased with degasing and values remained within the same range of 99 3 μg l by the end of migration day 21 regardless of degasing time suggesting that 2 min was sufficient to achieve a reduction in the initial migrant concentration from 551 μg l in s3 reference 4 6 mm wt pipe 60 c migration to 355 μg l after degasing using this experimental data the fem model was used to compute the mtbe diffusivity during both the degasing and migration processes mtbe diffusivity during the degasing treatment at 180 c d 180 c was 1 10 9 m2 s while diffusivity during the migration period d 60 c was 0 8 10 9 m2 s in good agreement with migration studies conducted throughout experiments s1s3 while an official health based guideline value has not been derived for mtbe it should be noted that in four studies the geometric mean detection threshold and as such the recommended taste and odour thresholds of mtbe in drinking water varies from 24 to 135 μg l and 15 180 μg l respectively who 2005 whereas the european commission states a threshold of 15 μg l ec 2001 specifically in the us the primary drinking water standards for mtbe vary from state to state and range from 10 to 240 μg l neiwpcc 2003 while the health advisory range for organoleptic taste and odour effects suggested by the u s environmental protection agency epa were 20 μg l 40 μg l epa 2008 it is evident that mtbe threshold values vary and this must be acknowledged since degasing conditions should be chosen to meet the specific regional national threshold values it should also be acknowledged that complicating factors e g disinfectant residuals biofilm and scale presence and water flow velocity in real water distribution systems can influence the aging and degradation of pex pipes dear and mason 2006 whelton and dietrich 2009 colin et al 2009a 2009b while these factors are beyond the aims of the present work their influence may be explored in future work as an extension to this study providing a wholestic tool which benefits both pipe manufacturers and drinking water sectors 3 2 5 summary of the diffusion results table 3 summarizes the mtbe diffusivities in pex from experiments s1 s4 diffusivities were computed by fitting the developed fem model to the experimental desorption data of figs 3 and 4 using a zero boundary mtbe concentration typical concentration profiles were as shown in fig 6 essentially all diffusivities from the s1 and s2 experiments were identical confirming the correctness of using zero concentration boundary conditions and considering a diffusion controlled migration process the computed diffusivity d 60 c 1 5 10 12 m2 s was close to a previously reported diffusivity 2 0 10 12 m2 s corrected for temperature using the piringer s model crompton 2007 it was also shown that d increases as expected with increasing migration temperature in the range 30 80 c for mtbe s3 the diffusivities between the different degasing times were desirably consistent since d 60 c only decreased slightly with degasing treatment s4 it can be concluded that d was at least not strongly concentration dependent as suggested in previous studies adams et al 2011 for any migration curve a reduction in the starting concentration c0 will thus result in a reduced final concentration with exactly the same factor consequently one of the most cost effective ways to reduce the chemical emissions from pex pipes is to reduce c0 through degasing of the pipes to conclude the fem diffusion model can now accurately predict the migrant concentration in drinking water as function of pipe geometry and migration temperature the model can thus be used as a valuable tool for minimizing the amounts of chemicals migrating from pex pipes into tap water 4 conclusions a combined experimental and simulation strategy was used for predicting the migration of chemicals from peroxide crosslinked water pipes into drinking water the decomposition product mtbe from the common dtbp peroxide crosslinking of pe was focused on in this study physical properties of pex pipes were determined with tga and dsc while hs gc ms was used to measure the concentration of chemicals in the drinking water as a function of time the experimental migration results were reasonable considering the physical properties of the compounds a fem diffusion model was developed for analyzing the migration providing predictions in good agreement with experimental migration validation data proper boundary conditions initial concentrations partitioning coefficients and temperature dependent diffusion coefficients were established by fitting the fem model to experimental results of tailor made migration experiments assuming an even distribution of migrants along the length of the pipe the model can accurately predict the concentration of chemicals in tap water as a function of time migration temperature and pex pipe geometry degasing was found to be an efficient strategy for reducing the migrant concentration in the pex pipes and the model can already be used for predicting ideal degasing times although complementary degasing experiments will be needed for computing d t over the whole temperature range of relevance and for additional validation of the model due to the prediction power of the new fem diffusion model the results of this study can enable pex pipe producers to optimize their production processes ultimately playing their part in ensuring a desirable water quality and an augmented

18864,water sensitive urban design is being promoted in many countries in singapore the active beautiful clean abc waters programme is a long term strategic initiative of pub singapore s national water agency to improve the quality of water and urban liveability while there are some estimates of the bio physical and ecological benefits of the abc waters programme information on its social or non market values is lacking using choice experiment datasets this study explores whether people express preferences for abc waters features it also examines whether there is any difference in preferences between respondents living in developments with and without abc waters certification and between respondents living in public and private housing it is found that respondents living in private housing have substantially higher willingness to pay for abc waters features compared to the respondents in public housing the differences between respondents from certified and non certified projects were found to be mixed such information would be useful to tailor the design of the abc waters program finally the potential impact of using a virtual reality tool to present information in a choice experiment towards people s preferences is explored application of a virtual reality tool has reduced the proportion of protest voters and increased people s willingness to pay for abc waters projects thus this paper contributes to the growing literature on the implications of providing information visually in non market valuation surveys keywords abc waters program choice experiment singapore virtual reality water sensitive urban design 1 introduction the active beautiful clean abc waters programme is a long term strategic initiative of pub singapore s national water agency to improve the quality of water and life by harnessing the full potential of singapore s more than 8000 km of waterways and 17 reservoirs the programme started in 2006 with the aims of creating new recreational and community spaces active integrating waterbodies and waterways with the urban landscape beautiful and improving water quality clean and cultivating environmental responsibility among the public in 2010 as part of the abc waters programme pub launched the abc waters certification scheme the scheme provides recognition to public agencies and private property developers who embrace the abc waters concept and incorporate abc waters design features in other geographies called water sensitive urban design features or sustainable urban drainage system features such as vegetated swales cleansing biotopes and green roofs in their developments besides providing recognition the scheme also aims to ensure that the features incorporated within developments meet a minimum design standard pub 2014 private developers and public agencies can apply for abc waters certification by submitting an application form which provides details on the abc waters design features implemented in the project pub scores each application based on four categories active beautiful clean and innovation in each category points can be scored for a number of criteria in that category a project needs to achieve a minimum of 45 out of a total of 100 points to become certified with at least five points in each of the first three categories see https www pub gov sg abcwaters certification criteria in august 2017 abc waters certified gold a higher tier of certification was launched to recognise entries of exceptional standards though because at the time of this study no gold certification had been issued yet only a distinction between certified and non certified projects is made there is anecdotal evidence that residents place positive values on abc waters certification and design features in their living environment however there had been no prior comprehensive assessment of community preferences abc waters design features are able to provide many different types of services such as amenity pollution reduction control of run off support of local biodiversity etc davis and naumann 2017 some of these benefits are easily observable and people may have a positive appreciation of these services other types of services are often not visible and may not be fully appreciated unless detailed information is provided moreover there is no market for many of these services so we cannot easily observe their prices except for amenity values which could be reflected in increased housing prices for instance yu and tu 2011 heinzle et al 2013 and belcher and chisholm 2018 studied the impacts of green amenities which is broader than abc waters design features only on residential property prices in singapore in this study we use a choice experiment to assess the benefits of abc waters design features a choice experiment is a non market valuation technique where willingness to pay wtp is elicited by surveys in which people can choose between different bundles of goods or services in a choice experiment goods and services are described in terms of attributes and attribute levels attributes are the different characteristics of goods or services that people are willing to pay for such as an aesthetically pleasing landscape or clean water in case of abc waters design features the levels are the amounts of the characteristic such as moderately or completely clean water based on the choices made during a survey it is possible to understand people s preferences for different attributes and estimate the trade offs between different attributes and attribute levels holmes et al 2017 lancaster 1966 mcfadden 1986 train 2009 choice experiments have been used extensively to study individual and household preferences in various policy sectors such as environment transportation health and social welfare programs e g adamowicz et al 1998 bennett and blamey 2001 carson and czajkowski 2014 there are some studies where people have examined the non market values of water sensitive systems and practices using choice experiments see gunawardena et al 2017 for a review however no choice experiment study has been conducted yet on the abc waters programme in singapore one of the challenges of estimating the non market values of abc waters design features is that to an uninformed person a raingarden or swale may not appear different from other greenery hence most abc waters certified projects include information signs or other communication materials to educate the residents on the abc waters design features in choice experiments it is common to include static images and verbal or written explanation to convey information iftekhar et al 2018 however static images may be inadequate to convey dynamic information such as flow of nutrients or sediments through a raingarden further static images present information from a fixed angle and do not allow the viewers to explore the project from different angles or distances a virtual reality tool could overcome both of these problems and can provide a much richer experience to the respondents and hence may result in a better more accurate valuation of abc waters design features virtual reality tools have been rarely used in choice experiments except see bateman et al 2009 matthews et al 2017 patterson et al 2017 and we are not aware that it has ever been used in choice experiments on water sensitive urban design features patterson et al 2017 compared results of an urban planning choice experiment with and without a virtual environment and found that visuals are best used when they give an accurate representation of possible outcomes as respondents base their decisions on the visuals while in text based experiments people rely on their mental image both bateman et al 2009 and matthews et al 2017 found that application of virtual reality tools could reduce judgement errors while making choices therefore in this study we have tested the effectiveness of a virtual reality tool using a between subjects design where one group of respondents were presented with text table and photo information and another group of respondents were presented with text table and virtual reality visualization information two additional issues we have explored are the impacts of respondents exposure to abc waters projects and socio economic conditions on their preferences several studies show that people s willingness to pay could be influenced by their familiarity with the choice situations cameron and englin 1997 schläpfer and fischhoff 2012 hence it is reasonable to expect that people living in properties that are abc waters certified have different preferences compared to those who are living in non certified properties similarly people living in different housing types could have different preferences in singapore 79 of the resident population lives in high rise public housing developed by the housing development board hdb known colloquially as hdb flats singapore department of statistics singstat 2018 private high rise residential properties commonly called condominiums cater to about 16 of the residential population mostly higher income families it further caters to a sizeable non resident population condominiums are usually gated and have amenities such as swimming pools underground carparks and elaborate landscaping such differences in socio economic conditions and living standards could influence people s willingness to pay as more affluent people might have higher willingness to pay due to higher disposable income in total we have collected data from five sub samples four sub samples are from people living in hdb flats with and without certification and people living in condominiums with and without certification 1 1 as of july 2016 of the 62 abc waters certified projects 24 are hdb developments 17 condominiums and executive condominiums 1 private mixed residential commercial use development and 30 non residential pub 2016 active beautiful clean waters programme certified projects 2010 2016 public utilities board https www pub gov sg abcwaters certification certifiedprojects singapore the fifth sub sample was from people living in hdb properties without certification who were presented background information using the virtual reality tool this sampling approach allowed us to answer the following three questions 1 is there any difference in preferences between respondents living in properties with and without abc waters certification 2 is there any difference in preferences between respondents living in condominiums and hdb flats and 3 does presenting information in a visual format impact people s preferences and choices of various services of abc waters design features answers to these questions will help us in understanding the social value of abc waters design features 2 data and method 2 1 design of the choice experiment the following steps were carried out to develop the questionnaire 1 literature search field visits and expert consultations 2 testing of the questionnaire through focus group discussions and internal testing 3 piloting of the questionnaire a comprehensive literature search was carried out to compile a list of attributes and levels of abc waters design features for consideration the literature included abc waters reports and manuals pub 2013 2014 2016 and academic literature on abc waters and similar programmes including buurman and padawangi 2017 gunawardena et al 2017 lim and lu 2016 yau et al 2017 field visits to abc waters certified properties and interviews with property developers conducted as part of a separate work package in the larger study 2 2 the choice experiment was conducted in a study consisting of three parts the first part consisted of obtaining the views of property developers on abc waters certification the second part was the choice experiment and the third part was a cost benefit analysis of a specific project also provided input for a relevant list of attributes though the main guidance was the scoring criteria for abc waters certification pub 2014 ch 7 the list of attributes was refined through meetings and consultations within the project team consisting of the authors of this paper and with senior staffs in charge of abc waters certification at pub two focus group discussions were conducted in september 2017 to test the draft questionnaire and get additional feedback on the topics raised in the survey in total 21 people participated 10 in the first focus group and 11 in the second the demographic profiles of the general population in singapore were represented in both groups e g representation of age gender education level and race internal testing of the questionnaire was carried out with participants at the bukit timah campus of the national university of singapore mostly university students and staffs to generate the initial design of the different choice sets that were required for the pilot two pilots with 50 completed responses each from the target population of the main survey i e people above the age of 21 from households renting or owning a hdb flat or condominium unit were carried out to test for different presentation styles between september to november 2017 based on these activities the following attributes and associated levels were selected fig 1 as the number of attributes and levels that can be included in the survey is practically limited by the length of the choice experiment we found in the focus group discussions and tests that about five choice sets is the maximum that people can or want to answer only attributes from the beautiful and clean categories of the scoring criteria for abc waters certification were included the active category is less directly related to the key environmental dimensions of water sensitive urban design slowing and cleansing rainwater runoff yet we did include a question in the survey to get respondents opinions on the signage which is related to the public education dimension of active see pub 2014 in addition the innovation scoring category is basically an open category and as such did not lend itself for evaluation in a choice experiment the above attributes and their levels can generate 200 possible options which is difficult to evaluate therefore the ngene software rose and bliemer 2012 was used to design the survey based on an s efficiency criteria as the objective was to estimate willingness to pay for individual sub samples scarpa and rose 2008 there were 25 choice sets blocked into five groups of five in each choice set respondents faced three options including an opt out option see appendix a inclusion of an opt out option is necessary to be consistent with the demand theory and to avoid bias in willingness to pay estimation to generate an efficient design it is required to obtain priors for the parameters of the utility functions rose and bliemer 2012 results from the pilot studies were used to generate the priors an important issue in a willingness to pay survey is the choice of the payment vehicle the payment method for abc waters design features needs to be realistic and negative associations with the payment vehicle should be avoided e g tax increase versus voluntary donation based on the authors previous experience with willingness to pay surveys in singapore and the focus group discussions it was decided to use the monthly building and estate maintenance fee which is charged by town councils for hdb flats and by management offices of condominiums as payment vehicle for the supposed additional costs of abc waters design features these maintenance fees are charged per address and partly proportional to the size of a flat or condominium unit 2 2 development of the virtual reality tool we used an innovative virtual reality tool for part of the sample to facilitate respondents decision making the choice experiment required that the respondents have a reasonable good understanding of abc waters design features and the benefits they can provide this required communicating technical information to the respondents such as how abc waters design features work and look like in the text version of the questionnaire the surveyor communicated information verbally and through three show cards show card 1 with photo examples of non abc waters drainage show card 2 with photo examples of abc waters design features and show card 3 with a photo of an abc waters information sign the virtual reality tool replaced the show cards and part of the verbal communication with a 3 minute tour of a virtual housing estate in which the situations without and with abc waters design features are shown and explained by a voice over this virtual reality tool was developed by the project team with help of an external vendor and piloted with 30 respondents based on the feedback from the pilot the visualization and the voice over text was slightly adapted and a guide on how to use the hardware and software in the field was developed for the surveyors the technology for the tool consists of a head mounted display used in combination with a mobile phone to view a virtual reality environment the respondents hear the voice over through headphones for a complete immersive experience this technology is mobile and thus suitable for the door to door surveying that was used for this study it allowed us to see if increased communication in the form of more detailed information and an immersive experience would facilitate respondents choices however as some people may feel uncomfortable viewing a virtual reality environment due to motion sickness the same content can be viewed as a 360 degree video on a mobile phone screen this option was used by 10 of the respondents who were not included in the formal analysis the 360 degree video version of the virtual reality visualization can be viewed at https youtu be x8bz1dzpzuk 2 3 data collection the survey was conducted from october to december 2017 for the text version and from february to march 2018 for virtual reality version data were collected from different groups of respondents to allow us to answer the main research questions in singapore household surveys can typically be conducted door to door for hdb flats only as access to condominiums is usually not granted hence residents of condominiums are usually surveyed street intercept style near their homes sampling was aimed at having a representative sample of the population in terms of demographic characteristics gender race age education and income type of hdb flat four size based types and geographical spread for the different groups only people above 21 years old whose household owned or rented a property in singapore were interviewed the virtual reality treatment was focussed only on the hdb non certified group in order to have a sufficiently large comparable sample for with and without treatment as this group is the largest in number of potential respondents 2 4 sample characteristics summary statistics of the socio demographic conditions of the respondents and knowledge and attitudes related to abc waters design features are presented in table 1 the demographics section in the top panel of the table show that there are differences between respondents living in hdb flats and condominiums pvt the differences generally reflect the expected demographics of hdb flats and private housing respondents were more or less evenly distributed between male and female and there is no difference between the sub samples based on pairwise comparisons more than 70 were chinese singapore s ethnic resident population composition is 74 chinese 13 malay 9 indian and 3 others singapore department of statistics singstat 2017 pp 5 except for the pvt cert nvr group where there is a relatively smaller proportion of chinese respondents this is likely due to more of these apartments being rented out to foreigners more than 65 of the respondents living in condominiums have university degrees however only around 30 of the respondents living in hdb flats have university degrees the age and gross monthly income of the respondents were more or less evenly distributed though in abc waters certified projects the proportion of respondents below 46 years is relatively larger especially for hdb flats reflecting that these are relatively newer developments where younger families live as expected the proportion of high income households is lower in hdb flats in the middle part of table 1 the respondents knowledge with respect to abc waters design features is presented only a small proportion of the respondents 16 had no idea whether their property had abc waters certification or not interestingly higher percentage of respondents living in non certified projects knew whether their property was abc certified or not however around 40 of the respondents considered it valuable to obtain abc waters certification for the estate or condominium they live in many of them also found value in displaying signage explaining the purpose and functioning of abc waters design features it should be noted that more than 60 of the respondents from the pvt ncert nvr group found it valuable to obtain abc waters certification and to display information about abc waters design features in signage finally in the bottom part of table 1 distributions of respondents by their response in likert scales to a series of statements are presented people have generally positive attitudes towards the value of water quality abc waters design features and the importance of involvement in abc waters management among the respondents the pvt ncert nvr group has expressed the strongest support there is general consensus that abc waters design features should be designed to maximize their environmental benefits and government agencies should implement abc waters design features however there is slightly less support for the statement that the general public could volunteer to maintain and look after abc waters design features 2 5 method to analyse choice preference data we have used a mixed logit model specification to analyse choice preference data such models have been commonly used to analyse discrete choice experiment surveys on water systems and features for example brent et al 2017 londoño cadavid and ando 2013 the specification is described below following scarpa et al 2008 in the context of our survey in the choice experiments respondents were presented with a set of alternative combinations of abc waters features and were asked to identify their most and least preferred options see appendix a in this paper the most preferred option has been modelled using random utility theory in the random utility theory it is assumed that a respondent i chooses alternative j in choice set t if the indirect utility of j is greater than that of any other choice k within the set i e u i t j u i t k v i t j ε i t j v i t k ε i t k s u c h t h a t j k j k ε t the utility of each option u i t j consists of a systematic component v i t j and an error component ε i t j the systematic component relates to the attributes and levels of individual options whereas the error component captures the impact of all unobservable factors train 2009 it is assumed that the systematic component is composed of the effect of price p i t j a vector of non priced attributes x i t j such as the different attributes of abc waters design features and the effect associated with the opt out neither option o i t j the utility function is described as 1 u i t j α i p i t j β i x i t j γ i o i t j ε i t j where α i β i and γ i are individual specific parameters for price non price attributes and the opt out option respectively ε i t j is assumed to drawn from a gumbel distribution with the respondent specific variance v a r ε i t j μ i 2 π 2 6 where μ i is the scale parameter for respondent i which is unobserved both sides of equation 1 is divided by μ i to obtain scale free equivalent 2 u i t j α i μ i p i t j β i μ i x i t j γ i μ i o i t j ε i t j where ε i t j is i i d type one extreme value distribution with constant variance π 2 6 the utility coefficients could be defined as ζ i α i μ i η i β i μ i and ϑ i γ i μ i and equation 2 could be re written as 3 u i t j ζ i p i t j η i x i t j ϑ i o i t j ε i t j it is assumed that if μ i varies randomly then the utility coefficients are correlated even if μ i does not vary over respondents utility coefficients could be correlated due to correlation among preferences for different attributes scarpa et al 2008 therefore during the estimation it is assumed that the random parameters are correlated the price parameter is assumed to be fixed whereas the parameters for the non price attributes and the opt out option were random normally distributed to estimate the models the maximum simulated likelihood routine mixlogit available in stata hole 2016 was used 2 6 comparison of sub samples our main questions are related to the impact of residency condition and the impact of providing virtual reality information on respondents preferences for different attributes whether or not different sub samples could be pooled into a single model was examined by using a likelihood ratio test the test statistics is calculated as 4 l r 2 l l p o o l e d l l 1 l l 2 l l 3 l l 4 l l 5 here l l 1 l l 2 l l 3 l l 4 and l l 5 are the log likelihoods of the five sub sample models and l l p o o l e d is the log likelihood of the pooled model if the log likelihood ratio test suggests separation of sub samples it is necessary to generate willingness to pay estimates separately for different sub samples the willingness to pay estimates are simulated based on the random parameter distribution of the coefficients from individual regression model estimates where at first 10 000 random draws r of coefficients for the individual attributes were generated using the krinsky robb procedure krinsky and robb 1986 for each sub sample next marginal willingness to pay for individual draws were calculated by taking the ratios of coefficients for specific attributes a and cost parameter multiplied by negative one i e 5 m w t r a 1 η r a ζ r to formally compare the distribution of marginal willingness to pay for different sub samples the test proposed by poe et al 2005 was used this is a one sided approximate test of significance based on complete combinatorial test to implement this test first the differences between all the possible combinations of simulated willingnesses to pay of any two sub samples were calculated this resulted in 10 4 10 4 calculated differences then the proportion of negative values in the distribution of differences were calculated as the level of significance to factor in multiple comparisons bonferoni adjustment was used comparison of marginal willingness to pay provide some indication of people s preferences however policy makers are often interested in the total value of a project or policy therefore we have calculated the total value compensating surplus as a linear combination of the 10 000 randomly drawn willingness to pay estimates simulated for individual attributes of a hypothetical project having abc waters design features with grass and shrubs that detain and cleanse runoff from 100 of the surface area the value of the neither option was subtracted to account for the fact that people may express strong preference or dis preference to avoid having the current situation finally the test developed by poe et al 2005 was used to compare total values of a project between different sub samples to answer the research questions 3 result the result section has been organized into the following sub sections analysis of people s response behaviour analysis of people s preferences comparison of willingness to pay and comparison of total value of a hypothetical abc waters certified property 3 1 analysis of people s response behaviour first we need to understand people s response to the questions and selection of their choices to assess the quality of the results table 2 presents the distribution of respondents in terms of their behaviour and responses to selected questions proportions tests were used to compare the groups and to understand whether any pair is significantly different from each other or not from the table it can be seen that the proportion of respondents that selected the neither option always is significantly lower in the pvt cert nvr and pvt ncert nvr groups compared to other groups and there is no significant difference between these two groups on the other hand the proportion of respondents who always selected the neither option and those who were protest voters is significantly higher for hdb ncert nvr group protest voters were defined as those who always selected the neither option and chose one or more of the following reasons i think i shouldn t have to pay for abc waters design features i don t believe that i should have to make these choices and i m already paying taxes most of the respondents took the choice experiment seriously and considered their financial circumstances while giving their responses very few of them ignored any attributes or cost elements except for the pvt ncert group there was not much difference among the groups in terms of their certainty and likely impact scores except for between hdb certified and non certified groups 3 2 analysis of people s preferences the estimates from mixed logit models equation 3 for different sub samples and pooled sample are presented in table 3 the lr test statistics for the pooled model is 428 p 0 01 which indicates that the models could not be pooled together a separate comparison with a scale adjusted pooled model also suggests that the sub sample models could not be pooled together therefore we focus on individual sub sample models in the following discussion examining the estimates in individual sub sample models in table 3 it can be observed that the treatment capacity and vegetation levels have expected directions in all groups which means that the higher the levels the higher are the values of the coefficients the vegetation parameter is statistically significant and positive across all groups indicating people s preferences for grass shrubs vegetation compared to grass only vegetation re use levels are non significant for most of the groups but they are very strongly correlated with each other see appendix b the cost parameter is statistically significant and negative in all models suggesting people s aversion to higher costs for robustness checking of the findings we present a set of estimation results in appendix c where we do not assume correlated structure 3 3 willingness to pay estimates the distribution of willingness to pay estimates derived from using equation 5 is presented in table 4 people were willing to pay to have abc waters design features with grass and shrubs compared to grass only to filter rainfall runoff from a higher proportion of the surface area in their estate and to have a higher level of re use capacity design feature levels however there are substantial overlaps in peoples willingness to pay across different groups table 4 a formal poe test suggests that for all the attributes and the neither option there are no statistically significant differences in the distribution of marginal willingness to pay except for treatment capacity table 5 willingness to pay for treatment capacity is the highest for pvt cert nvr followed by hdb ncert vr and pvt ncert nvr there is no significant difference between hdb cert nvr and hdb ncert nvr sub samples 3 4 total value from our study we gather that there is generally broad support for abc waters design features in singapore to demonstrate this point further we calculate the total value of a hypothetical abc waters project using the method described in the method section the distributions of total values of different respondent groups is presented in fig 2 it can be seen that the median total value is the lowest for the hdb ncert nvr group 232 annum household followed by hdb cert nvr 241 annum household hdb ncert vr 301 annum household pvt ncert nvr 442 annum household and pvt cert nvr 865 annum household there is no significant difference in the distribution of total values between certified and non certified hdb groups even though the distributions of total values are significantly different to each other between the other groups see table 6 it can be observed that the difference between certified and non certified projects varies with the type of residence for condominiums respondents from certified projects have statistically significantly higher total value this could be due to the visibility of abc waters design features respondents in certified projects appreciate the abc waters design features more this could also be related to their income status as respondents are in higher income group compared to those in private non certified group on the other hand for hdb there is no difference between certified and non certified projects comparison of median total value estimates between respondents from condominiums and hdb flats reveals that respondents from condominiums have expressed higher willingness to pay this could be due to the fact that respondents living in condominiums have higher income than respondents living in hdb flats finally we analysed whether providing information through a virtual reality tool has any impact on people s willingness to pay the relevant comparison is between hdb ncert nvr and hdb ncert vr it can be seen that providing information through a virtual reality tool enhances people s willingness to pay table 6 it is possible that by using a virtual reality tool it becomes easier for the respondents to understand or appreciate the intangible or indirect benefits of abc waters design features more easily which results in a higher willingness to pay for these services in the virtual reality treatment 4 discussion our analysis revealed that there is a significant willingness to pay difference between responses from people living in hdb flats and condominiums this correlates with income as private housing dwellers tend to have higher incomes in addition people living in condominiums are on average better educated a larger proportion has a university degree see table 1 which may affect their willingness to pay leaving aside ethical questions about providing a better living environment for higher income families purely from cost benefit perspective a targeted approach for abc waters certification of private developments could be justified one would expect that familiarity with abc waters design features would increase willingness to pay as residents may be more familiar with the benefits however the impact of existing certification is opposite for private and public housing residents from certified condominiums indeed have a higher willingness to pay yet we do not observe such difference for public housing a combination of demographics and age of developments could most likely explain this all certified properties are new developments that have been completed since the certification scheme started in 2010 as no existing properties have been retrofitted with abc waters design features new public housing developments mostly attract young families and are located in new housing estates these estates have better designs and landscaping than older estates and hence the difference between those with abc waters certification and without may be less visible while at the same time young families have many financial commitments and hence a lower willingness to pay for less essential amenities for private housing the explanation is most likely income related as residents of certified condominiums have higher incomes than non certified condominiums this leads to the conclusion that demographic factors and specifically income are more relevant in explaining differences between willingness to pay for abc waters design features than the type of property or certification using virtual reality to explain to respondents how abc waters design features look like work and what their benefits are increases their overall appreciation and willingness to pay respondents have to make choices on something they likely have never thought about within the short time span of a survey a virtual reality tool in which visual dynamic images combined with voice over audio text labels and icons are used is able to focus the respondents attention and convey much more information in a short time span it seems that in general use of virtual reality enhances people s willingness to pay for abc waters design features which is reflected in the total value of a project such analysis is useful in designing stated preference surveys for water sensitive urban designs 5 conclusion our study is one of the first non market valuation studies on the large scale water sensitive urban design program the abc waters program in singapore the choice experiment results provide support that residents in singapore have positive preference for abc waters design features as expected there are variations in preferences among different groups of respondents we observed that respondents living in private housing are willing to pay a higher amount than people living in public housing application of a virtual reality tool has enhanced people s willingness to pay the non market valuation estimates could be used in a formal benefit cost analysis to examine if investments in abc waters design features could be justified for example the relative benefits of implementing various types of abc waters design features for different groups of residents could be compared against the cost of implementation of abc waters design features such analysis would not only improve the efficiency of government spending but also facilitate investment decisions which are more likely to be socially acceptable declaration of interests this research received funding support from singapore s public utilities

18864,water sensitive urban design is being promoted in many countries in singapore the active beautiful clean abc waters programme is a long term strategic initiative of pub singapore s national water agency to improve the quality of water and urban liveability while there are some estimates of the bio physical and ecological benefits of the abc waters programme information on its social or non market values is lacking using choice experiment datasets this study explores whether people express preferences for abc waters features it also examines whether there is any difference in preferences between respondents living in developments with and without abc waters certification and between respondents living in public and private housing it is found that respondents living in private housing have substantially higher willingness to pay for abc waters features compared to the respondents in public housing the differences between respondents from certified and non certified projects were found to be mixed such information would be useful to tailor the design of the abc waters program finally the potential impact of using a virtual reality tool to present information in a choice experiment towards people s preferences is explored application of a virtual reality tool has reduced the proportion of protest voters and increased people s willingness to pay for abc waters projects thus this paper contributes to the growing literature on the implications of providing information visually in non market valuation surveys keywords abc waters program choice experiment singapore virtual reality water sensitive urban design 1 introduction the active beautiful clean abc waters programme is a long term strategic initiative of pub singapore s national water agency to improve the quality of water and life by harnessing the full potential of singapore s more than 8000 km of waterways and 17 reservoirs the programme started in 2006 with the aims of creating new recreational and community spaces active integrating waterbodies and waterways with the urban landscape beautiful and improving water quality clean and cultivating environmental responsibility among the public in 2010 as part of the abc waters programme pub launched the abc waters certification scheme the scheme provides recognition to public agencies and private property developers who embrace the abc waters concept and incorporate abc waters design features in other geographies called water sensitive urban design features or sustainable urban drainage system features such as vegetated swales cleansing biotopes and green roofs in their developments besides providing recognition the scheme also aims to ensure that the features incorporated within developments meet a minimum design standard pub 2014 private developers and public agencies can apply for abc waters certification by submitting an application form which provides details on the abc waters design features implemented in the project pub scores each application based on four categories active beautiful clean and innovation in each category points can be scored for a number of criteria in that category a project needs to achieve a minimum of 45 out of a total of 100 points to become certified with at least five points in each of the first three categories see https www pub gov sg abcwaters certification criteria in august 2017 abc waters certified gold a higher tier of certification was launched to recognise entries of exceptional standards though because at the time of this study no gold certification had been issued yet only a distinction between certified and non certified projects is made there is anecdotal evidence that residents place positive values on abc waters certification and design features in their living environment however there had been no prior comprehensive assessment of community preferences abc waters design features are able to provide many different types of services such as amenity pollution reduction control of run off support of local biodiversity etc davis and naumann 2017 some of these benefits are easily observable and people may have a positive appreciation of these services other types of services are often not visible and may not be fully appreciated unless detailed information is provided moreover there is no market for many of these services so we cannot easily observe their prices except for amenity values which could be reflected in increased housing prices for instance yu and tu 2011 heinzle et al 2013 and belcher and chisholm 2018 studied the impacts of green amenities which is broader than abc waters design features only on residential property prices in singapore in this study we use a choice experiment to assess the benefits of abc waters design features a choice experiment is a non market valuation technique where willingness to pay wtp is elicited by surveys in which people can choose between different bundles of goods or services in a choice experiment goods and services are described in terms of attributes and attribute levels attributes are the different characteristics of goods or services that people are willing to pay for such as an aesthetically pleasing landscape or clean water in case of abc waters design features the levels are the amounts of the characteristic such as moderately or completely clean water based on the choices made during a survey it is possible to understand people s preferences for different attributes and estimate the trade offs between different attributes and attribute levels holmes et al 2017 lancaster 1966 mcfadden 1986 train 2009 choice experiments have been used extensively to study individual and household preferences in various policy sectors such as environment transportation health and social welfare programs e g adamowicz et al 1998 bennett and blamey 2001 carson and czajkowski 2014 there are some studies where people have examined the non market values of water sensitive systems and practices using choice experiments see gunawardena et al 2017 for a review however no choice experiment study has been conducted yet on the abc waters programme in singapore one of the challenges of estimating the non market values of abc waters design features is that to an uninformed person a raingarden or swale may not appear different from other greenery hence most abc waters certified projects include information signs or other communication materials to educate the residents on the abc waters design features in choice experiments it is common to include static images and verbal or written explanation to convey information iftekhar et al 2018 however static images may be inadequate to convey dynamic information such as flow of nutrients or sediments through a raingarden further static images present information from a fixed angle and do not allow the viewers to explore the project from different angles or distances a virtual reality tool could overcome both of these problems and can provide a much richer experience to the respondents and hence may result in a better more accurate valuation of abc waters design features virtual reality tools have been rarely used in choice experiments except see bateman et al 2009 matthews et al 2017 patterson et al 2017 and we are not aware that it has ever been used in choice experiments on water sensitive urban design features patterson et al 2017 compared results of an urban planning choice experiment with and without a virtual environment and found that visuals are best used when they give an accurate representation of possible outcomes as respondents base their decisions on the visuals while in text based experiments people rely on their mental image both bateman et al 2009 and matthews et al 2017 found that application of virtual reality tools could reduce judgement errors while making choices therefore in this study we have tested the effectiveness of a virtual reality tool using a between subjects design where one group of respondents were presented with text table and photo information and another group of respondents were presented with text table and virtual reality visualization information two additional issues we have explored are the impacts of respondents exposure to abc waters projects and socio economic conditions on their preferences several studies show that people s willingness to pay could be influenced by their familiarity with the choice situations cameron and englin 1997 schläpfer and fischhoff 2012 hence it is reasonable to expect that people living in properties that are abc waters certified have different preferences compared to those who are living in non certified properties similarly people living in different housing types could have different preferences in singapore 79 of the resident population lives in high rise public housing developed by the housing development board hdb known colloquially as hdb flats singapore department of statistics singstat 2018 private high rise residential properties commonly called condominiums cater to about 16 of the residential population mostly higher income families it further caters to a sizeable non resident population condominiums are usually gated and have amenities such as swimming pools underground carparks and elaborate landscaping such differences in socio economic conditions and living standards could influence people s willingness to pay as more affluent people might have higher willingness to pay due to higher disposable income in total we have collected data from five sub samples four sub samples are from people living in hdb flats with and without certification and people living in condominiums with and without certification 1 1 as of july 2016 of the 62 abc waters certified projects 24 are hdb developments 17 condominiums and executive condominiums 1 private mixed residential commercial use development and 30 non residential pub 2016 active beautiful clean waters programme certified projects 2010 2016 public utilities board https www pub gov sg abcwaters certification certifiedprojects singapore the fifth sub sample was from people living in hdb properties without certification who were presented background information using the virtual reality tool this sampling approach allowed us to answer the following three questions 1 is there any difference in preferences between respondents living in properties with and without abc waters certification 2 is there any difference in preferences between respondents living in condominiums and hdb flats and 3 does presenting information in a visual format impact people s preferences and choices of various services of abc waters design features answers to these questions will help us in understanding the social value of abc waters design features 2 data and method 2 1 design of the choice experiment the following steps were carried out to develop the questionnaire 1 literature search field visits and expert consultations 2 testing of the questionnaire through focus group discussions and internal testing 3 piloting of the questionnaire a comprehensive literature search was carried out to compile a list of attributes and levels of abc waters design features for consideration the literature included abc waters reports and manuals pub 2013 2014 2016 and academic literature on abc waters and similar programmes including buurman and padawangi 2017 gunawardena et al 2017 lim and lu 2016 yau et al 2017 field visits to abc waters certified properties and interviews with property developers conducted as part of a separate work package in the larger study 2 2 the choice experiment was conducted in a study consisting of three parts the first part consisted of obtaining the views of property developers on abc waters certification the second part was the choice experiment and the third part was a cost benefit analysis of a specific project also provided input for a relevant list of attributes though the main guidance was the scoring criteria for abc waters certification pub 2014 ch 7 the list of attributes was refined through meetings and consultations within the project team consisting of the authors of this paper and with senior staffs in charge of abc waters certification at pub two focus group discussions were conducted in september 2017 to test the draft questionnaire and get additional feedback on the topics raised in the survey in total 21 people participated 10 in the first focus group and 11 in the second the demographic profiles of the general population in singapore were represented in both groups e g representation of age gender education level and race internal testing of the questionnaire was carried out with participants at the bukit timah campus of the national university of singapore mostly university students and staffs to generate the initial design of the different choice sets that were required for the pilot two pilots with 50 completed responses each from the target population of the main survey i e people above the age of 21 from households renting or owning a hdb flat or condominium unit were carried out to test for different presentation styles between september to november 2017 based on these activities the following attributes and associated levels were selected fig 1 as the number of attributes and levels that can be included in the survey is practically limited by the length of the choice experiment we found in the focus group discussions and tests that about five choice sets is the maximum that people can or want to answer only attributes from the beautiful and clean categories of the scoring criteria for abc waters certification were included the active category is less directly related to the key environmental dimensions of water sensitive urban design slowing and cleansing rainwater runoff yet we did include a question in the survey to get respondents opinions on the signage which is related to the public education dimension of active see pub 2014 in addition the innovation scoring category is basically an open category and as such did not lend itself for evaluation in a choice experiment the above attributes and their levels can generate 200 possible options which is difficult to evaluate therefore the ngene software rose and bliemer 2012 was used to design the survey based on an s efficiency criteria as the objective was to estimate willingness to pay for individual sub samples scarpa and rose 2008 there were 25 choice sets blocked into five groups of five in each choice set respondents faced three options including an opt out option see appendix a inclusion of an opt out option is necessary to be consistent with the demand theory and to avoid bias in willingness to pay estimation to generate an efficient design it is required to obtain priors for the parameters of the utility functions rose and bliemer 2012 results from the pilot studies were used to generate the priors an important issue in a willingness to pay survey is the choice of the payment vehicle the payment method for abc waters design features needs to be realistic and negative associations with the payment vehicle should be avoided e g tax increase versus voluntary donation based on the authors previous experience with willingness to pay surveys in singapore and the focus group discussions it was decided to use the monthly building and estate maintenance fee which is charged by town councils for hdb flats and by management offices of condominiums as payment vehicle for the supposed additional costs of abc waters design features these maintenance fees are charged per address and partly proportional to the size of a flat or condominium unit 2 2 development of the virtual reality tool we used an innovative virtual reality tool for part of the sample to facilitate respondents decision making the choice experiment required that the respondents have a reasonable good understanding of abc waters design features and the benefits they can provide this required communicating technical information to the respondents such as how abc waters design features work and look like in the text version of the questionnaire the surveyor communicated information verbally and through three show cards show card 1 with photo examples of non abc waters drainage show card 2 with photo examples of abc waters design features and show card 3 with a photo of an abc waters information sign the virtual reality tool replaced the show cards and part of the verbal communication with a 3 minute tour of a virtual housing estate in which the situations without and with abc waters design features are shown and explained by a voice over this virtual reality tool was developed by the project team with help of an external vendor and piloted with 30 respondents based on the feedback from the pilot the visualization and the voice over text was slightly adapted and a guide on how to use the hardware and software in the field was developed for the surveyors the technology for the tool consists of a head mounted display used in combination with a mobile phone to view a virtual reality environment the respondents hear the voice over through headphones for a complete immersive experience this technology is mobile and thus suitable for the door to door surveying that was used for this study it allowed us to see if increased communication in the form of more detailed information and an immersive experience would facilitate respondents choices however as some people may feel uncomfortable viewing a virtual reality environment due to motion sickness the same content can be viewed as a 360 degree video on a mobile phone screen this option was used by 10 of the respondents who were not included in the formal analysis the 360 degree video version of the virtual reality visualization can be viewed at https youtu be x8bz1dzpzuk 2 3 data collection the survey was conducted from october to december 2017 for the text version and from february to march 2018 for virtual reality version data were collected from different groups of respondents to allow us to answer the main research questions in singapore household surveys can typically be conducted door to door for hdb flats only as access to condominiums is usually not granted hence residents of condominiums are usually surveyed street intercept style near their homes sampling was aimed at having a representative sample of the population in terms of demographic characteristics gender race age education and income type of hdb flat four size based types and geographical spread for the different groups only people above 21 years old whose household owned or rented a property in singapore were interviewed the virtual reality treatment was focussed only on the hdb non certified group in order to have a sufficiently large comparable sample for with and without treatment as this group is the largest in number of potential respondents 2 4 sample characteristics summary statistics of the socio demographic conditions of the respondents and knowledge and attitudes related to abc waters design features are presented in table 1 the demographics section in the top panel of the table show that there are differences between respondents living in hdb flats and condominiums pvt the differences generally reflect the expected demographics of hdb flats and private housing respondents were more or less evenly distributed between male and female and there is no difference between the sub samples based on pairwise comparisons more than 70 were chinese singapore s ethnic resident population composition is 74 chinese 13 malay 9 indian and 3 others singapore department of statistics singstat 2017 pp 5 except for the pvt cert nvr group where there is a relatively smaller proportion of chinese respondents this is likely due to more of these apartments being rented out to foreigners more than 65 of the respondents living in condominiums have university degrees however only around 30 of the respondents living in hdb flats have university degrees the age and gross monthly income of the respondents were more or less evenly distributed though in abc waters certified projects the proportion of respondents below 46 years is relatively larger especially for hdb flats reflecting that these are relatively newer developments where younger families live as expected the proportion of high income households is lower in hdb flats in the middle part of table 1 the respondents knowledge with respect to abc waters design features is presented only a small proportion of the respondents 16 had no idea whether their property had abc waters certification or not interestingly higher percentage of respondents living in non certified projects knew whether their property was abc certified or not however around 40 of the respondents considered it valuable to obtain abc waters certification for the estate or condominium they live in many of them also found value in displaying signage explaining the purpose and functioning of abc waters design features it should be noted that more than 60 of the respondents from the pvt ncert nvr group found it valuable to obtain abc waters certification and to display information about abc waters design features in signage finally in the bottom part of table 1 distributions of respondents by their response in likert scales to a series of statements are presented people have generally positive attitudes towards the value of water quality abc waters design features and the importance of involvement in abc waters management among the respondents the pvt ncert nvr group has expressed the strongest support there is general consensus that abc waters design features should be designed to maximize their environmental benefits and government agencies should implement abc waters design features however there is slightly less support for the statement that the general public could volunteer to maintain and look after abc waters design features 2 5 method to analyse choice preference data we have used a mixed logit model specification to analyse choice preference data such models have been commonly used to analyse discrete choice experiment surveys on water systems and features for example brent et al 2017 londoño cadavid and ando 2013 the specification is described below following scarpa et al 2008 in the context of our survey in the choice experiments respondents were presented with a set of alternative combinations of abc waters features and were asked to identify their most and least preferred options see appendix a in this paper the most preferred option has been modelled using random utility theory in the random utility theory it is assumed that a respondent i chooses alternative j in choice set t if the indirect utility of j is greater than that of any other choice k within the set i e u i t j u i t k v i t j ε i t j v i t k ε i t k s u c h t h a t j k j k ε t the utility of each option u i t j consists of a systematic component v i t j and an error component ε i t j the systematic component relates to the attributes and levels of individual options whereas the error component captures the impact of all unobservable factors train 2009 it is assumed that the systematic component is composed of the effect of price p i t j a vector of non priced attributes x i t j such as the different attributes of abc waters design features and the effect associated with the opt out neither option o i t j the utility function is described as 1 u i t j α i p i t j β i x i t j γ i o i t j ε i t j where α i β i and γ i are individual specific parameters for price non price attributes and the opt out option respectively ε i t j is assumed to drawn from a gumbel distribution with the respondent specific variance v a r ε i t j μ i 2 π 2 6 where μ i is the scale parameter for respondent i which is unobserved both sides of equation 1 is divided by μ i to obtain scale free equivalent 2 u i t j α i μ i p i t j β i μ i x i t j γ i μ i o i t j ε i t j where ε i t j is i i d type one extreme value distribution with constant variance π 2 6 the utility coefficients could be defined as ζ i α i μ i η i β i μ i and ϑ i γ i μ i and equation 2 could be re written as 3 u i t j ζ i p i t j η i x i t j ϑ i o i t j ε i t j it is assumed that if μ i varies randomly then the utility coefficients are correlated even if μ i does not vary over respondents utility coefficients could be correlated due to correlation among preferences for different attributes scarpa et al 2008 therefore during the estimation it is assumed that the random parameters are correlated the price parameter is assumed to be fixed whereas the parameters for the non price attributes and the opt out option were random normally distributed to estimate the models the maximum simulated likelihood routine mixlogit available in stata hole 2016 was used 2 6 comparison of sub samples our main questions are related to the impact of residency condition and the impact of providing virtual reality information on respondents preferences for different attributes whether or not different sub samples could be pooled into a single model was examined by using a likelihood ratio test the test statistics is calculated as 4 l r 2 l l p o o l e d l l 1 l l 2 l l 3 l l 4 l l 5 here l l 1 l l 2 l l 3 l l 4 and l l 5 are the log likelihoods of the five sub sample models and l l p o o l e d is the log likelihood of the pooled model if the log likelihood ratio test suggests separation of sub samples it is necessary to generate willingness to pay estimates separately for different sub samples the willingness to pay estimates are simulated based on the random parameter distribution of the coefficients from individual regression model estimates where at first 10 000 random draws r of coefficients for the individual attributes were generated using the krinsky robb procedure krinsky and robb 1986 for each sub sample next marginal willingness to pay for individual draws were calculated by taking the ratios of coefficients for specific attributes a and cost parameter multiplied by negative one i e 5 m w t r a 1 η r a ζ r to formally compare the distribution of marginal willingness to pay for different sub samples the test proposed by poe et al 2005 was used this is a one sided approximate test of significance based on complete combinatorial test to implement this test first the differences between all the possible combinations of simulated willingnesses to pay of any two sub samples were calculated this resulted in 10 4 10 4 calculated differences then the proportion of negative values in the distribution of differences were calculated as the level of significance to factor in multiple comparisons bonferoni adjustment was used comparison of marginal willingness to pay provide some indication of people s preferences however policy makers are often interested in the total value of a project or policy therefore we have calculated the total value compensating surplus as a linear combination of the 10 000 randomly drawn willingness to pay estimates simulated for individual attributes of a hypothetical project having abc waters design features with grass and shrubs that detain and cleanse runoff from 100 of the surface area the value of the neither option was subtracted to account for the fact that people may express strong preference or dis preference to avoid having the current situation finally the test developed by poe et al 2005 was used to compare total values of a project between different sub samples to answer the research questions 3 result the result section has been organized into the following sub sections analysis of people s response behaviour analysis of people s preferences comparison of willingness to pay and comparison of total value of a hypothetical abc waters certified property 3 1 analysis of people s response behaviour first we need to understand people s response to the questions and selection of their choices to assess the quality of the results table 2 presents the distribution of respondents in terms of their behaviour and responses to selected questions proportions tests were used to compare the groups and to understand whether any pair is significantly different from each other or not from the table it can be seen that the proportion of respondents that selected the neither option always is significantly lower in the pvt cert nvr and pvt ncert nvr groups compared to other groups and there is no significant difference between these two groups on the other hand the proportion of respondents who always selected the neither option and those who were protest voters is significantly higher for hdb ncert nvr group protest voters were defined as those who always selected the neither option and chose one or more of the following reasons i think i shouldn t have to pay for abc waters design features i don t believe that i should have to make these choices and i m already paying taxes most of the respondents took the choice experiment seriously and considered their financial circumstances while giving their responses very few of them ignored any attributes or cost elements except for the pvt ncert group there was not much difference among the groups in terms of their certainty and likely impact scores except for between hdb certified and non certified groups 3 2 analysis of people s preferences the estimates from mixed logit models equation 3 for different sub samples and pooled sample are presented in table 3 the lr test statistics for the pooled model is 428 p 0 01 which indicates that the models could not be pooled together a separate comparison with a scale adjusted pooled model also suggests that the sub sample models could not be pooled together therefore we focus on individual sub sample models in the following discussion examining the estimates in individual sub sample models in table 3 it can be observed that the treatment capacity and vegetation levels have expected directions in all groups which means that the higher the levels the higher are the values of the coefficients the vegetation parameter is statistically significant and positive across all groups indicating people s preferences for grass shrubs vegetation compared to grass only vegetation re use levels are non significant for most of the groups but they are very strongly correlated with each other see appendix b the cost parameter is statistically significant and negative in all models suggesting people s aversion to higher costs for robustness checking of the findings we present a set of estimation results in appendix c where we do not assume correlated structure 3 3 willingness to pay estimates the distribution of willingness to pay estimates derived from using equation 5 is presented in table 4 people were willing to pay to have abc waters design features with grass and shrubs compared to grass only to filter rainfall runoff from a higher proportion of the surface area in their estate and to have a higher level of re use capacity design feature levels however there are substantial overlaps in peoples willingness to pay across different groups table 4 a formal poe test suggests that for all the attributes and the neither option there are no statistically significant differences in the distribution of marginal willingness to pay except for treatment capacity table 5 willingness to pay for treatment capacity is the highest for pvt cert nvr followed by hdb ncert vr and pvt ncert nvr there is no significant difference between hdb cert nvr and hdb ncert nvr sub samples 3 4 total value from our study we gather that there is generally broad support for abc waters design features in singapore to demonstrate this point further we calculate the total value of a hypothetical abc waters project using the method described in the method section the distributions of total values of different respondent groups is presented in fig 2 it can be seen that the median total value is the lowest for the hdb ncert nvr group 232 annum household followed by hdb cert nvr 241 annum household hdb ncert vr 301 annum household pvt ncert nvr 442 annum household and pvt cert nvr 865 annum household there is no significant difference in the distribution of total values between certified and non certified hdb groups even though the distributions of total values are significantly different to each other between the other groups see table 6 it can be observed that the difference between certified and non certified projects varies with the type of residence for condominiums respondents from certified projects have statistically significantly higher total value this could be due to the visibility of abc waters design features respondents in certified projects appreciate the abc waters design features more this could also be related to their income status as respondents are in higher income group compared to those in private non certified group on the other hand for hdb there is no difference between certified and non certified projects comparison of median total value estimates between respondents from condominiums and hdb flats reveals that respondents from condominiums have expressed higher willingness to pay this could be due to the fact that respondents living in condominiums have higher income than respondents living in hdb flats finally we analysed whether providing information through a virtual reality tool has any impact on people s willingness to pay the relevant comparison is between hdb ncert nvr and hdb ncert vr it can be seen that providing information through a virtual reality tool enhances people s willingness to pay table 6 it is possible that by using a virtual reality tool it becomes easier for the respondents to understand or appreciate the intangible or indirect benefits of abc waters design features more easily which results in a higher willingness to pay for these services in the virtual reality treatment 4 discussion our analysis revealed that there is a significant willingness to pay difference between responses from people living in hdb flats and condominiums this correlates with income as private housing dwellers tend to have higher incomes in addition people living in condominiums are on average better educated a larger proportion has a university degree see table 1 which may affect their willingness to pay leaving aside ethical questions about providing a better living environment for higher income families purely from cost benefit perspective a targeted approach for abc waters certification of private developments could be justified one would expect that familiarity with abc waters design features would increase willingness to pay as residents may be more familiar with the benefits however the impact of existing certification is opposite for private and public housing residents from certified condominiums indeed have a higher willingness to pay yet we do not observe such difference for public housing a combination of demographics and age of developments could most likely explain this all certified properties are new developments that have been completed since the certification scheme started in 2010 as no existing properties have been retrofitted with abc waters design features new public housing developments mostly attract young families and are located in new housing estates these estates have better designs and landscaping than older estates and hence the difference between those with abc waters certification and without may be less visible while at the same time young families have many financial commitments and hence a lower willingness to pay for less essential amenities for private housing the explanation is most likely income related as residents of certified condominiums have higher incomes than non certified condominiums this leads to the conclusion that demographic factors and specifically income are more relevant in explaining differences between willingness to pay for abc waters design features than the type of property or certification using virtual reality to explain to respondents how abc waters design features look like work and what their benefits are increases their overall appreciation and willingness to pay respondents have to make choices on something they likely have never thought about within the short time span of a survey a virtual reality tool in which visual dynamic images combined with voice over audio text labels and icons are used is able to focus the respondents attention and convey much more information in a short time span it seems that in general use of virtual reality enhances people s willingness to pay for abc waters design features which is reflected in the total value of a project such analysis is useful in designing stated preference surveys for water sensitive urban designs 5 conclusion our study is one of the first non market valuation studies on the large scale water sensitive urban design program the abc waters program in singapore the choice experiment results provide support that residents in singapore have positive preference for abc waters design features as expected there are variations in preferences among different groups of respondents we observed that respondents living in private housing are willing to pay a higher amount than people living in public housing application of a virtual reality tool has enhanced people s willingness to pay the non market valuation estimates could be used in a formal benefit cost analysis to examine if investments in abc waters design features could be justified for example the relative benefits of implementing various types of abc waters design features for different groups of residents could be compared against the cost of implementation of abc waters design features such analysis would not only improve the efficiency of government spending but also facilitate investment decisions which are more likely to be socially acceptable declaration of interests this research received funding support from singapore s public utilities
