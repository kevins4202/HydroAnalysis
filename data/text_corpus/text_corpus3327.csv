16635,residual manganese ii in finished water undergoes further oxidation and deposition in drinking water distribution systems dwds and mn deposits can function as sites for accumulating organic and inorganic pollutants this study aims to explore how mn transformation and deposition affect the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps in chlorinated dwds and trihalomethanes thms was selected as a representative dbp in a 100 μg l mn system regulated thms chlorinated bromated thms increased by over 20 higher than mn free system after 150 day operation when 50 μg l iodide i entered pipe systems after 150 days iodinated thms i thms in 100 μg l mn system increased by over 30 compared with mn free system these promotions were attributed primarily to the accumulation of biomolecules and organic substances by tight and hard chlorinated mn deposits the residence of inactivated cells and the bridging role of surface mn iii in mn deposits increased the quantity of thm precursors in dwds furthermore the rapid catalytic oxidation of mn ii by preformed mn oxides mnox inhibited the conversion of free iodine hoi oi to iodate resulting in the generation of more i thms this study provides new insights into the dbp risks caused by mn in dwds graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords drinking water distribution system trihalomethanes manganese organics accumulation catalytic oxidation 1 introduction the formation of halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps is a non negligible drawback of drinking water chlorination which may lead to higher health risks such as bladder cancer evlampidou et al 2020 especially for brominated trihalomethanes thms which is associated with hepatic injury and type ii diabetes mellitus makris et al 2016 among halogenated dbps thms is detected extensively in tap water with relatively high concentration huang et al 2017 yu et al 2019 the total regulated thms chlorinated bromated thms dibromochloromethane dbcm dichlorobromomethane dcbm trichloromethane tcm and tribromomethane tbm are restricted as less than 80 μg l by the united states environmental protection agency usepa and the sum of the ratio of each regulated thm concentration to its respective limiting value dbcm 100 μg l dcbm 60 μg l tcm 60 μg l tbm100 μg l is restricted as less than 1 0 according to the standards for drinking water quality of china gb5749 2006 however the concentrations of regulated thms could surpass the regulation requirements in tap water of some regions such as the measured average value for thms in canada was 75 μg l guilherme and rodriguez 2014 total thms in tap water in cyprus reached to 70 0 μg l gangler et al 2018 and a median of total thms reached to 114 7 μg l in sabadell spain villanueva et al 2011 moreover the occurrence of iodinated thms i thms with higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity is also a great concern ding et al 2013 ioannou et al 2016 previous studies demonstrated that unlined iron and copper pipes with their corrosion products can significantly affect the dbp formation process chu et al 2016b hu et al 2021a liu et al 2013 moreover the transformation and deposition of metals derived from finished water in chlorinated dwds are also very common bai et al 2019 bot et al 2016 dissolved manganese ion mn ii which is relatively difficult to be removed by drinking water treatment process can be gradually oxidized into particulate mn oxides mnox by disinfectant in dwds especially in rural dwds and urban terminal pipelines with long hydraulic retention time li et al 2020c the processes of mn ii oxidation and deposition can be accelerated by coexisting metal aluminum or cupric ions or oxides allard et al 2013 li et al 2018 li et al 2020a moreover mn deposits can accumulate trace organic and inorganic pollutants chen et al 2020 dong et al 2000 mckenzie 1980 biogenic mnox can adsorb more pollutants than synthetic mno2 due to its higher specific surface area nelson et al 1999 hence the deposits are potential carriers for aquatic pollutants if they are released to bulk water under hydraulic disturbance li et al 2019 the increased thm concentrations from finished water to consumers tap water were closely related to the presence of pipe scales and biofilms on pipe walls guilherme and rodriguez 2014 makris et al 2014 yu et al 2019 moreover the mn scales and metal divalent cation such as ca2 on pipe walls could increase biofilm risk in dwds even if plastic pipes were employed makris et al 2014 it has demonstrated that mn concentration had significant correlation with the total dbps in plastic pipes yu et al 2019 and kurajica et al 2021 found that tcm was correlated with tyrosine like component in dwds of a croatian city which was significantly positively correlated with mn r 0 36 p 0 05 in hydrant samples kurajica et al 2021 it is inferred that the accumulation of mn would have effects on the formation of dbps in dwds moreover mn was the main component in plastic pipe deposits in areas which suffered from water discoloration problem in tap water li et al 2019 yu et al 2019 but the effects of mn ii chlorination on the formation of dbps are still inconclusive mn ii was found to enhance the formation of haloacetic acids haas from citric acid and aconitic acid because of complexation or redox reactions tada et al 2020 however a study showed that the yields of haas could be decreased by formed mnox coated on the algal cells ge et al 2011 moreover it was reported that the iodide i concentration could be up to 103 8 μg l in actual tap water and the total mn concentration the sum of mn ii and mnox was up to 63 9 μg l li et al 2019 xu 2005 the co existence of i residual chlorine and mn could be possible under some actual dwds conditions many studies proved that birnessite δ mno2 played an enhanced role in iodination of nom in disinfectant free system δ mno2 catalyzes the oxidation of i to iodine and the polarization of the iodine molecule i2 which then reacts with nom to generate iodinated byproducts allard and gallard 2013 allard et al 2010 gallard et al 2009 hao et al 2018 in fact the free iodine hoi oi generated by incomplete oxidation of i will react with organic matters to generate i dbps in chlorinated dwds gong and zhang 2013 jones et al 2012 however the formation of i dbps from i in the presence of mn under chlorinated dwds conditions has never been reported the main purpose of this study is to reveal the roles of mn transformation and deposition in the formation of regulated thms and i thms in dwds through pipe experiments as well as beaker experiments the compositions of mn deposits in the presence and absence of free chlorine were compared to better elucidate the characteristics of organics accumulation in chlorinated dwds 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials stock solution 10 g l of dissolved manganese ion mn ii was prepared by dissolving manganese sulfate monohydrate mnso4 h2o sinopharm chemical in 1 hno3 sodium hypochlorite naclo 38 72 g l as cl2 hushi shanghai was used to prepare a chlorine stock solution of 50 mg l as cl2 every 24 h stock solution 500 mg l of iodide i was prepared with ki 99 5 sinopharm chemical in ultrapure water regulated thms including dbcm dcbm tcm and tbm were obtained from accustandard inc new haven ct usa i thms including dichloroiodomethane dcim diiodochloromethane dicm and triiodomethane tim were obtained from j k china methyl tert butyl ether mtbe was obtained from j k china concanavalin a cona and calcofluor white cw were obtained from sigma aldrich america fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc was obtained from medchemexpress america and syto 63 was obtained from thermofish scientific america 2 2 pipe experiments 2 2 1 pipe experiment setup the new polyethylene pe pipes 150 cm dn 63 which are commonly used as distribution pipelines in actual dwds in many countries holder et al 2019 jara arriagada and stoianov 2021 were soaked with 2 hno3 solution for 24 h to eliminate the influence of possible impurity metals and organics fig 1 depicts the installation diagram of the pipe experiments a 5 l of 50 mg l as cl2 free chlorine stock solution and 250 l sand filtered water from an actual water treatment plant containing low mn and i concentrations were prepared freshly every 24 h and they were sealed in bucket 1 and bucket 2 next the free chlorine stock solution was mixed with sand filtered water by suction pump and silicone tube dn 3 1 to keep the concentration of free chlorine at 0 9 0 04 mg l steadily in bucket 3 the mn ii stock solutions in bucket a d were freshly prepared with sand filtered water every 24 h the concentrations of mn ii in bucket a d were 0 μg l 20 μg l 100 μg l and 200 μg l respectively then the mn ii solutions in bucket a d were mixed with the water in bucket 3 under the same flow rate and entered the pe pipes together within 30 s free chlorine concentration in the influent water of the pe pipes at this time was 0 45 0 02 mg l and the concentrations of mn ii in corresponding pe pipes were 0 μg l 10 μg l 50 μg l and 100 μg l respectively the overall goal of the above process was to ensure the same concentration of free chlorine and gradient mn ii concentrations in influent water of the pipe experiments the concentrations of mn ii in pipe experiments conformed to the typical regulatory level for mn in finished water in the range of 50 100 μg l li et al 2019 besides in order to compare the morphological and compositional characteristics of mn deposits at distal dwds lack of disinfectant we set a nondisinfected pe pipe with 100 μg l mn ii in influent water which was obtained by directly mixing the sand filtered water in bucket 2 with the water containing 200 μg l mn ii in bucket e at the same flow rate all buckets were washed once a week and pe pipes were laid flat the experimental water passed through the pe pipes just once and the effluents of pipe experiments were discarded this process was conducted daily as to the flow rate it had not been changed during the whole 165 day pipe experiments which was 1 1 cm min to observe the influence of mn on the formation of i thms 50 μg l i was added to bucket a d with gradient mn ii concentrations after 150 day operation to make sure free chlorine was excessive for i to meet the actual drinking water conditions free chlorine concentration was adjusted to 2 0 0 04 mg l in bucket 3 free chlorine concentration was 1 0 0 02 mg l in pe pipes correspondingly after 157 day operation 50 μg l i was replaced by 200 μg l i and added it to bucket a d the experiments were terminated on the 165th day all waters used in pipe experiments were prepared every 24 h 2 2 2 sampling processes of pipe experiments sampling processes for detecting conventional water quality parameters and the concentrations of thms in effluent water of pipe experiments are provided in text s1 the collected effluent water samples were immediately tested on site or pretreated in the laboratory when the pipe experiments were operated in 130 days duplicated sections of 10 cm long pipe pieces from each pe pipe were cut for thm formation potential thmfp tests when the pipe experiments were operated in 150 days mn deposits in pe pipes were collected to characterize their morphology and composition and the details of the sampling processes are depicted in fig s1 the mn deposits were scraped with a sterile cotton swab from 5 cm long pipe pieces and the deposits were dispersed into the phosphate buffered solution pbs for detecting seventeen hydrolyzed amino acids aas and colonies number the extracellular polymeric substance eps in mn deposits were obtained by ultrasonication centrifugation method developed by previous studies jia et al 2017 you et al 2015 the detailed extraction procedures are described in text s2 biofilm eps is categorized as slime eps seps and bound eps jia et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 bound eps consists of two layers the inner layer is tightly bound eps tb eps while the outer layer is loosely bound eps lb eps xing et al 2020 all eps samples were prepared in triplicate confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm zeiss lsm880 germany scanning electron microscope sem nova nanosem 450 america atomic force microscopy afm bruker germany x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo scientific america and x ray diffraction xrd rigaku corporation japan were used to explore the morphological and compositional characteristics of the mn deposits collected on the 150th day 0 5 0 5 cm pipe pieces were stained in situ and characterized with clsm 0 3 0 3 cm thin pipe pieces from freeze dried pipe sections were obtained for sem analysis and afm analysis the pipe pieces for clsm afm and sem analysis were all cut from the bottom parts of the pe pipes before pe pipe sampling the cutter was sterilized with alcohol mn deposits in 15 cm freeze dried pe pipes were scraped for xrd and xps analysis moreover after the experiments ran for 165 days the mn deposits exposed to 1 0 mg l free chlorine were collected in the same way for xps analysis 2 3 beaker experiments in order to further explore the influence of mn on i thms formation in pipe experiments the formation of hoi oi the main active product leading to i thms from i was studied under the following beaker experiments i the chlorination of mn ii with preformed mnox ii the chlorination of mn ii without preformed mnox iii the chlorination with preformed mnox but without mn ii and iv the chlorination without mn ii and preformed mnox the preformed mnox in i and iii was obtained by oxidizing 2 mg l mn ii with 4 5 mg l free chlorine in 1 l ultrapure water for 50 h the ultrapure water was kept at ph 7 8 0 1 with carbonate buffer and naoh or hcl adjustment in glass beakers under rapid magnetic agitation then free chlorine concentration was adjusted to 4 5 mg l once again in i and iii with formed mnox and the same concentration of free chlorine was added to 1 l ultrapure water in two glass beakers for ii and iv experiments ph was adjusted to 7 8 0 1 in four beaker experiments the hoi oi formation was initiated by adding fresh 2 5 mg l i and 2 5 mg l mn ii solutions to reactors the dosage of free chlorine i and mn ii were relatively high in beaker experiments because low i concentration would yield low hoi oi that is not sufficient for characterization during each experiment the water samples at selected times were prepared as follows a 4 ml water sample filtered through a 0 22 μm filter was collected and 1 hno3 was added for dissolving mn a 4 ml water sample filtered with 0 45 μm filter was put into a centrifuge tube with excess phenol and shaken to generate iodophenol for testing hoi oi all experiments in this study were conducted in duplicate at room temperature 25 1 c the details of thmfp experiments are provided in text s3 2 4 analytical methods the detection details of conventional water quality parameters are given in text s4 and the results of sand filtered water influent water of pipe experiments are given in table s1 for the determination of thms water samples were extracted with methyl tert butyl ether mtbe and analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with an electronic capture detector gc ecd agilent 7890b america and an hp 5 fused silica capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm agilent america the details of the detection methods are provided in table s2 for seventeen kinds of hydrolyzed aas analysis the detection details are described in text s5 iodophenol formed by hoi oi and phenol was quantified by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1260 america the detection details of iodophenol are given in text s6 the zeta potentials of three types of eps samples were determined using a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms nexion 300 perkinelmer and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes shimadzu 9800 japan were used to quantify the mn concentrations clsm was used to visualize the spatial distributions of proteins polysaccharides and total cells including live and inactivated cells in mn deposits on inner walls of gradient mn ii concentrations systems cona cw fitc and syto 63 were used to label the α polysaccharides β polysaccharides proteins and total cells respectively in the deposits in this study chen et al 2007 chen et al 2006 yu et al 2011 the staining details are described in text s7 and the excitation and emission wavelengths of each dye are listed in table s3 the quantitative parameters of α polysaccharides β polysaccharides proteins and total cells according to the area coverage were obtained with zeiss confocal software zen black edition in addition elastic modulus young s modulus e of freeze dried deposits on inner walls were estimated by afm the details are provided in text s8 3 results and discussion 3 1 the thm profile in effluent water of pe pipes during pipe experiments the concentrations of regulated thms or i thms in the effluents of gradient mn systems with chlorination were tested regularly the thm concentration in the influent of pe pipes was 7 1 1 3 μg l during the pipe experiments which was due to the disinfection reactions prior to entering pipes fig 2 shows the percent differences of regulated thm concentrations from the first day to the 150th day and the concentrations of i thms in effluents of gradient mn systems with 50 μg l i 151 157 days and 200 μg l i 158 165 days taking the mn free system as a reference when influent water contained 100 μg l mn ii the average concentration of regulated thms was 18 3 μg l on the 150th day increased from 10 9 μg l on the first day while there was no mn ii the average concentration of regulated thms was 15 0 μg l on the 150th day in the effluent of pipe experiments increased from 12 5 μg l on the first day compared with the mn free system the percent difference of regulated thms concentration in 100 μg l mn system on the first day was 13 which could be attributed to the consumption of free chlorine due to oxidation of mn ii however the regulated thms concentration in 100 μg l mn system on the150th day was 22 higher than mn free system and the percent differences were 12 higher for 50 μg l mn system the results of the paired samples t test indicated that the difference of regulated thm concentrations between the 100 μg l mn system and mn free system was significant p 0 02 from 50 to 150 days given the high cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of i dbps the pipe experiments simulated the formation of i thms when mn systems contained i after 150 day study of regulated thms the concentrations of i thms increased in mn systems contained 50 μg l i 151 157 day and 200 μg l i 158 165 day compared with mn free system in fig 2 as the mn ii concentration increased in influent water more i thms formed with dicm accounting for the highest proportion in 100 μg l mn system with 50 μg l i the i thms concentration was 32 more than that in mn free system i thms increased by 23 after i concentration was increased from 50 μg l to 200 μg l clearly the presence of mn increased the risk of i thms in addition the average values of colonies number microbiological water quality indicators turbidity and dissolved organic carbon doc in effluent exhibited an increasing trend with the increase of mn ii concentration in influent water during 150 days fig s2 the correlation analysis indicated that there were significant positive correlations between mn ii concentration in influent water and the average values of colonies number r 0 99 p 0 01 turbidity r 0 97 p 0 00 doc r 0 73 p 0 00 in effluent water when the pipe experiments were operated in 130 days the thmfps of mn deposits in 0 μg l 10 μg l 50 μg l and 100 μg l mn systems are shown in fig s3 the thmfp of mn deposits in 100 μg l mn system was the highest and the thmfp of mn deposits increased with the increased mn ii concentration in influent water of pipe experiment it was inferred that the characteristic and composition of mn deposits might enhance the thm formation in the effluents of pipe experiments 3 2 the characteristic of mn deposits 3 2 1 formation of mn deposits fig 3 depicts the temporal variations of total and dissolved mn concentrations in pipe experiments with gradient mn ii concentrations as the operating time elapsed the concentrations of total and dissolved mn in the effluent decreased indicating that mn deposits were gradually formed fig 3a b c moreover the mnox the difference between total and dissolved mn in effluents of gradient mn systems increased during later stage when mn deposits formed already it was consistent with previous studies that rapid catalytic oxidation reactions of mn ii will occur in the presence of mnox allard et al 2013 li et al 2020a in addition the consumptions of free chlorine between the influents and effluents of pe pipes with gradient mn ii concentrations would increase as operating time of pipe experiments extended taking chlorinated system with 100 μg l mn ii as an example the consumption of free chlorine on the first day was 0 23 0 03 mg l however the consumption increased to 0 36 0 06 mg l on the 150th day therefore mnox showed a rapider deposition behavior during later stage of the experiments due to the rapid catalytic oxidation of mn ii resulting in increased free chlorine consumption in terms of nondisinfected system with 100 μg l mn ii fig 3d the constant concentrations of total and dissolved mn in the effluent during 150 days indicated that the biological oxidation process was slow probably because the inner wall of pe pipe was not conducive to the enrichment of the mn related microorganisms 3 2 2 the morphology of mn deposits inner walls of nondisinfected pe pipe with 100 μg l mn ii and chlorinated pe pipe with 100 μg l mn ii are shown in fig s4 a series of enlarged sem images under different experiment conditions with or without free chlorine 100 μg l and 50 μg l mn ii are shown in fig s5 loose deposits were formed in nondisinfected system with 100 μg l mn ii and there were apparent nodules with pores in the deposits which was consistent with the literature murdoch and smith 1999 in addition fig s5b e c and f represent the relatively tight mn deposits formed by chlorination of 100 μg l and 50 μg l mn ii on inner walls the area covered by mn deposits on inner wall increased with the increase of mn ii concentration in chlorinated influent water to compare the deposits mechanical property the elastic modulus young s modulus e was measured by afm fig 4 the mean value of e in chlorinated mn deposits with 100 μg l mn ii was three times higher than that of nondisinfected mn deposits 430 6 mpa vs 131 4 mpa and the mean value of e in chlorinated mn deposits with 50 μg l mn ii was 211 8 mpa the stiffness of mn deposits significantly increased during free chlorine exposure and the stiffness increased with the increased mn ii concentration in the chlorinated influent water the tight and hard mn deposits were difficult to be removed by pipe network flushing a routine pipe network maintenance measure therefore the effects on the dbp formation in dwds were continuous 3 3 the composition of mn deposits 3 3 1 biomolecules in mn deposits the temporal variations of regulated thms in pe pipes effluents were closely related to the composition of mn deposits on inner walls formed by chlorination of mn ii the xrd pattern of the mn deposits chlorination of 100 μg l mn ii is provided in fig s6 according to the xrd data previously reported the most important metal crystals were manganese dioxide mno2 and calcium carbonate caco3 chen et al 2020 li et al 2020b the results of proteins polysaccharides and total cells in top views of chlorinated mn deposits gradient mn ii concentrations and nondisinfected mn deposits 100 μg l mn ii were determined by clsm in situ on the 150th day fig 5 a b c d e combined with the quantitative results in fig s7 the amounts of proteins α polysaccharides β polysaccharides and total cells increased significantly with the increase of mn deposit area and their amounts in mn deposits formed by chlorination of 100 μg l mn ii were 19 137 17 and 127 times higher than that of deposits without mn ii respectively moreover biomolecules proteins and polysaccharides in chlorinated mn deposits under free chlorine exposure were higher than that of nondisinfected deposits when influent water with 100 μg l mn ii besides the results for total aas were similar with biomolecules quantities by clsm fig s8 the sequence of aas was serine ser asparagine asp glutamic acid glu arginine arg histidine his phenylalanine phe other aas accounting for 28 16 14 7 6 5 and 23 of the total aas respectively in terms of microorganisms in chlorinated mn deposits the amount of total cells including live and inactivated cells increased with the increase of chlorinated mn deposits which was consistent with the result of colonies number fig 5f however the amounts of total cells and colonies number were the opposite in chlorinated and nondisinfected mn deposits 100 μg l mn ii in influent water the amount of total cells in chlorinated mn deposits was higher than that in nondisinfected mn deposits but colonies number in chlorinated mn deposits was lower than that in nondisinfected mn deposits indicating that dead cells inactivated by free chlorine still remained in the chlorinated mn deposits literatures have reported that biomolecules in dwds biofilm can increase thm concentration in tap water hu et al 2021b wang et al 2013 furthermore his gly li et al 2017 alanine ala chu et al 2009 and tryptophan tyr chu et al 2016a have been reported to generate thms during the chlorination process 3 3 2 organic substances in mn deposits within dwds untreated nom has also been linked to enhanced biological instability camper 2004 however the accumulation mechanism of organic matter in deposits of dwds is rarely studied xps analysis was performed to compare the mn deposits formed by 100 μg l mn ii at free chlorine concentrations of 0 45 mg l on the 150th day and 1 0 mg l on the 165th day the mn 2p and c 1 s xps spectra for the mn deposits formed by 0 45 mg l and 1 0 mg l free chlorine are given in fig 6 a b the characteristic peaks of mn 2p in mn deposits were at 642 8 ev and 654 2 ev fig s9a b which were consistent with the peaks of the electronic energy spectra of mn 2p in mno2 lan et al 2019 as shown in fig 6a there were two peaks at binding energy 641 6 and 642 8 ev the components were attributable to the surface mn iii and mn iv species ji et al 2020 peng et al 2020 wang et al 2012a zhang et al 2019 respectively in fig 6b the binding energies at 284 8 ev and 288 7 ev attributed to cc c c and oc o bonds respectively ahmed et al 2018 khan et al 2020 combining fig 6a b when surface mn iii decreased under 1 0 mg l free chlorine on the 165th day the relative intensities of cc c c and oc o also decreased simultaneously the carboxyl groups might come from biomolecules and natural organic matters in raw water esparza soto and westerhoff 2003 wang et al 2012b it was reported that the humic acid and fulvic acid in raw water contained 4 9 and 6 1 mmol cooh g c respectively therefore surface mn iii could play a bridging role between mn deposits and carboxyl organic matter huang et al 2020 liu et al 2009 zhang et al 2021 which enhanced the accumulation of organic substances in mn deposits it was consistent with the results previously reported that mn iii have the potential to form complexes with ligands pyrophosphate edta and citrate under certain natural water conditions klewicki and morgan 1998 madison et al 2011 and according to schulze hardy rule nowicki and nowicka 1994 trivalent ions are more efficient in the linkage process than divalent and single charged ions ca2 mg2 na and k while the increase of free chlorine caused the decrease of the bridging role of mn iii in mn deposits the carboxyl groups in the mn deposits decreased in addition the results of zeta potentials of seps lb eps and tb eps in mn deposits formed by chlorination of gradient mn ii concentrations on the 150th day confirmed the above analysis fig s10 the zeta potentials decreased significantly when mn deposits increased mn ii concentration increased in influent water the compressed electrical double layer decreased the potential energy between mn deposits and organic substances esparza soto and westerhoff 2003 wang et al 2012b resulting in easier functional groups interactions which can be explained by derjaugin landau verwey and overbeek dlvo theory chen et al 2020 hermansson 1999 3 4 mechanism of i thms formation enhanced by mn as mentioned above in the formation of i thms in pipe experiments the presence of mn could increase the i thms formation i thms is formed by the reaction of hoi oi with organic matter when i intrudes chlorinated dwds gong and zhang 2013 i can be oxidized to hoi oi when the concentration of chlorine is relatively low jones et al 2012 however when there is enough free chlorine preformed hoi oi can be further oxidized to iodate io3 ullman et al 1990 since the catalytic oxidation of mn ii consumes free chlorine beaker experiments were conducted to further observe the effects of this process on i thms formation because i thms mainly comes from the nom oxidation by hoi oi this section mainly discussed the generation of hoi oi fig 7 shows the formation of hoi oi from i in the presence and absence of catalytic oxidation of mn ii during chlorination in beaker experiments the corresponding variations in dissolved mn and residual free chlorine concentrations are shown in fig s11a b obviously the production of hoi oi dropped to zero after 20 min under three conditions ii iii and iv chlorination of mn ii in the absence of preformed mnox chlorination of mn ii in the presence of preformed mnox and chlorination without any forms of mn however when mnox formed in situ the concentration of hoi oi could be maintained for 240 min during catalytic oxidation of mn ii i hence the catalytic oxidation of mn ii by mnox resulted in higher hoi oi concentration previous studies can explain above result the reaction rate constant of i and free chlorine to form hoi oi is 4 3 108 m 1 s 1 the reaction rate constant for the subsequent io2 formation from free chlorine and hoi oi is 8 20 m 1 s 1 bichsel and gunten 1999 the reaction rate constant for subsequent io3 formation from io2 and free chlorine is 1 106 m 2 s 1 liu et al 2014 in practical dwds the formation of io3 is a rapid process which can decrease the formation of i dbps however when mnox formed the reaction rate constant of mn ii and free chlorine can increase from 6 4 10 4 m 1 s 1 to 4 106 m 2 s 1 at ph 8 0 allard et al 2013 hence the catalytic oxidation reaction of mn ii could inhibit the oxidation of hoi oi to io3 resulting in more residue of hoi oi accordingly if residual mn ii in finished water enters chlorination dwds the rapid catalytic oxidation reaction of mn ii is initiated by formed mn deposits which would increase the formation of i dbps in tap water in the presence of i free chlorine consumption by catalytic metal oxidation such as mn ii and pb ii oxidation is common in dwds li et al 2020a pan et al 2019 however according to the i dbps formation mechanism when the ratio of the free chlorine concentration to the i concentration is relatively high the disinfectant concentration in dwds is relatively high or the i concentration is relatively low this situation is not applicable previous studies mainly focus on the effects of unlined cast metal pipes and their corrosion products on dbp formation and transformation in drinking water but the influences of residual metal ions in chlorinated dwds are not paid much attention yet particularly dissolved mn ii that is difficult to be removed by traditional water treatment processes could be gradually oxidized into particulate mnox by disinfectant in dwds it is reported that some areas have the problem of water discoloration in tap water caused by formed mnox in dwds whether it is rural or urban kurajica et al 2021 li et al 2019 moreover water flow condition would influence the thickness and hardness of mn deposits on pipe walls shen et al 2016 the deposition of particulate mnox on the pipe wall not only cause the problem of water discoloration in tap water but also the accumulation of microorganisms and organic matter which would inevitably affect the dbp formation and transformation behaviors therefore the practical implications of this study are to reveal the influence of the chlorination and deposition of the residual mn ii in finished water on the generation and transformation of thms which could provide more understanding on the effective control of dbp risks and even together with the discoloration issue control with a more comprehensive strategy from water treatment plant to consumers taps 4 conclusion the present study which revealed that mn in chlorinated dwds gave rise to the dbp risk in tap water can lead to the following conclusions the formation of both regulated thms and i thms could be enhanced by mn chlorination and deposition in chlorinated dwds the accumulation of biomolecules and organic matters which can act as thm precursors could be facilitated by the residence of inactivated cells and the bridging role of mn iii in mn deposits on pipe walls i thms formation was enhanced by the free chlorine competition between catalytic oxidation reaction of mn ii and further oxidation of hoi oi to io3 when mn deposits formed in chlorinated dwds declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing financial interest or personal relationships that could influence the work

16635,residual manganese ii in finished water undergoes further oxidation and deposition in drinking water distribution systems dwds and mn deposits can function as sites for accumulating organic and inorganic pollutants this study aims to explore how mn transformation and deposition affect the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps in chlorinated dwds and trihalomethanes thms was selected as a representative dbp in a 100 μg l mn system regulated thms chlorinated bromated thms increased by over 20 higher than mn free system after 150 day operation when 50 μg l iodide i entered pipe systems after 150 days iodinated thms i thms in 100 μg l mn system increased by over 30 compared with mn free system these promotions were attributed primarily to the accumulation of biomolecules and organic substances by tight and hard chlorinated mn deposits the residence of inactivated cells and the bridging role of surface mn iii in mn deposits increased the quantity of thm precursors in dwds furthermore the rapid catalytic oxidation of mn ii by preformed mn oxides mnox inhibited the conversion of free iodine hoi oi to iodate resulting in the generation of more i thms this study provides new insights into the dbp risks caused by mn in dwds graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords drinking water distribution system trihalomethanes manganese organics accumulation catalytic oxidation 1 introduction the formation of halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps is a non negligible drawback of drinking water chlorination which may lead to higher health risks such as bladder cancer evlampidou et al 2020 especially for brominated trihalomethanes thms which is associated with hepatic injury and type ii diabetes mellitus makris et al 2016 among halogenated dbps thms is detected extensively in tap water with relatively high concentration huang et al 2017 yu et al 2019 the total regulated thms chlorinated bromated thms dibromochloromethane dbcm dichlorobromomethane dcbm trichloromethane tcm and tribromomethane tbm are restricted as less than 80 μg l by the united states environmental protection agency usepa and the sum of the ratio of each regulated thm concentration to its respective limiting value dbcm 100 μg l dcbm 60 μg l tcm 60 μg l tbm100 μg l is restricted as less than 1 0 according to the standards for drinking water quality of china gb5749 2006 however the concentrations of regulated thms could surpass the regulation requirements in tap water of some regions such as the measured average value for thms in canada was 75 μg l guilherme and rodriguez 2014 total thms in tap water in cyprus reached to 70 0 μg l gangler et al 2018 and a median of total thms reached to 114 7 μg l in sabadell spain villanueva et al 2011 moreover the occurrence of iodinated thms i thms with higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity is also a great concern ding et al 2013 ioannou et al 2016 previous studies demonstrated that unlined iron and copper pipes with their corrosion products can significantly affect the dbp formation process chu et al 2016b hu et al 2021a liu et al 2013 moreover the transformation and deposition of metals derived from finished water in chlorinated dwds are also very common bai et al 2019 bot et al 2016 dissolved manganese ion mn ii which is relatively difficult to be removed by drinking water treatment process can be gradually oxidized into particulate mn oxides mnox by disinfectant in dwds especially in rural dwds and urban terminal pipelines with long hydraulic retention time li et al 2020c the processes of mn ii oxidation and deposition can be accelerated by coexisting metal aluminum or cupric ions or oxides allard et al 2013 li et al 2018 li et al 2020a moreover mn deposits can accumulate trace organic and inorganic pollutants chen et al 2020 dong et al 2000 mckenzie 1980 biogenic mnox can adsorb more pollutants than synthetic mno2 due to its higher specific surface area nelson et al 1999 hence the deposits are potential carriers for aquatic pollutants if they are released to bulk water under hydraulic disturbance li et al 2019 the increased thm concentrations from finished water to consumers tap water were closely related to the presence of pipe scales and biofilms on pipe walls guilherme and rodriguez 2014 makris et al 2014 yu et al 2019 moreover the mn scales and metal divalent cation such as ca2 on pipe walls could increase biofilm risk in dwds even if plastic pipes were employed makris et al 2014 it has demonstrated that mn concentration had significant correlation with the total dbps in plastic pipes yu et al 2019 and kurajica et al 2021 found that tcm was correlated with tyrosine like component in dwds of a croatian city which was significantly positively correlated with mn r 0 36 p 0 05 in hydrant samples kurajica et al 2021 it is inferred that the accumulation of mn would have effects on the formation of dbps in dwds moreover mn was the main component in plastic pipe deposits in areas which suffered from water discoloration problem in tap water li et al 2019 yu et al 2019 but the effects of mn ii chlorination on the formation of dbps are still inconclusive mn ii was found to enhance the formation of haloacetic acids haas from citric acid and aconitic acid because of complexation or redox reactions tada et al 2020 however a study showed that the yields of haas could be decreased by formed mnox coated on the algal cells ge et al 2011 moreover it was reported that the iodide i concentration could be up to 103 8 μg l in actual tap water and the total mn concentration the sum of mn ii and mnox was up to 63 9 μg l li et al 2019 xu 2005 the co existence of i residual chlorine and mn could be possible under some actual dwds conditions many studies proved that birnessite δ mno2 played an enhanced role in iodination of nom in disinfectant free system δ mno2 catalyzes the oxidation of i to iodine and the polarization of the iodine molecule i2 which then reacts with nom to generate iodinated byproducts allard and gallard 2013 allard et al 2010 gallard et al 2009 hao et al 2018 in fact the free iodine hoi oi generated by incomplete oxidation of i will react with organic matters to generate i dbps in chlorinated dwds gong and zhang 2013 jones et al 2012 however the formation of i dbps from i in the presence of mn under chlorinated dwds conditions has never been reported the main purpose of this study is to reveal the roles of mn transformation and deposition in the formation of regulated thms and i thms in dwds through pipe experiments as well as beaker experiments the compositions of mn deposits in the presence and absence of free chlorine were compared to better elucidate the characteristics of organics accumulation in chlorinated dwds 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials stock solution 10 g l of dissolved manganese ion mn ii was prepared by dissolving manganese sulfate monohydrate mnso4 h2o sinopharm chemical in 1 hno3 sodium hypochlorite naclo 38 72 g l as cl2 hushi shanghai was used to prepare a chlorine stock solution of 50 mg l as cl2 every 24 h stock solution 500 mg l of iodide i was prepared with ki 99 5 sinopharm chemical in ultrapure water regulated thms including dbcm dcbm tcm and tbm were obtained from accustandard inc new haven ct usa i thms including dichloroiodomethane dcim diiodochloromethane dicm and triiodomethane tim were obtained from j k china methyl tert butyl ether mtbe was obtained from j k china concanavalin a cona and calcofluor white cw were obtained from sigma aldrich america fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc was obtained from medchemexpress america and syto 63 was obtained from thermofish scientific america 2 2 pipe experiments 2 2 1 pipe experiment setup the new polyethylene pe pipes 150 cm dn 63 which are commonly used as distribution pipelines in actual dwds in many countries holder et al 2019 jara arriagada and stoianov 2021 were soaked with 2 hno3 solution for 24 h to eliminate the influence of possible impurity metals and organics fig 1 depicts the installation diagram of the pipe experiments a 5 l of 50 mg l as cl2 free chlorine stock solution and 250 l sand filtered water from an actual water treatment plant containing low mn and i concentrations were prepared freshly every 24 h and they were sealed in bucket 1 and bucket 2 next the free chlorine stock solution was mixed with sand filtered water by suction pump and silicone tube dn 3 1 to keep the concentration of free chlorine at 0 9 0 04 mg l steadily in bucket 3 the mn ii stock solutions in bucket a d were freshly prepared with sand filtered water every 24 h the concentrations of mn ii in bucket a d were 0 μg l 20 μg l 100 μg l and 200 μg l respectively then the mn ii solutions in bucket a d were mixed with the water in bucket 3 under the same flow rate and entered the pe pipes together within 30 s free chlorine concentration in the influent water of the pe pipes at this time was 0 45 0 02 mg l and the concentrations of mn ii in corresponding pe pipes were 0 μg l 10 μg l 50 μg l and 100 μg l respectively the overall goal of the above process was to ensure the same concentration of free chlorine and gradient mn ii concentrations in influent water of the pipe experiments the concentrations of mn ii in pipe experiments conformed to the typical regulatory level for mn in finished water in the range of 50 100 μg l li et al 2019 besides in order to compare the morphological and compositional characteristics of mn deposits at distal dwds lack of disinfectant we set a nondisinfected pe pipe with 100 μg l mn ii in influent water which was obtained by directly mixing the sand filtered water in bucket 2 with the water containing 200 μg l mn ii in bucket e at the same flow rate all buckets were washed once a week and pe pipes were laid flat the experimental water passed through the pe pipes just once and the effluents of pipe experiments were discarded this process was conducted daily as to the flow rate it had not been changed during the whole 165 day pipe experiments which was 1 1 cm min to observe the influence of mn on the formation of i thms 50 μg l i was added to bucket a d with gradient mn ii concentrations after 150 day operation to make sure free chlorine was excessive for i to meet the actual drinking water conditions free chlorine concentration was adjusted to 2 0 0 04 mg l in bucket 3 free chlorine concentration was 1 0 0 02 mg l in pe pipes correspondingly after 157 day operation 50 μg l i was replaced by 200 μg l i and added it to bucket a d the experiments were terminated on the 165th day all waters used in pipe experiments were prepared every 24 h 2 2 2 sampling processes of pipe experiments sampling processes for detecting conventional water quality parameters and the concentrations of thms in effluent water of pipe experiments are provided in text s1 the collected effluent water samples were immediately tested on site or pretreated in the laboratory when the pipe experiments were operated in 130 days duplicated sections of 10 cm long pipe pieces from each pe pipe were cut for thm formation potential thmfp tests when the pipe experiments were operated in 150 days mn deposits in pe pipes were collected to characterize their morphology and composition and the details of the sampling processes are depicted in fig s1 the mn deposits were scraped with a sterile cotton swab from 5 cm long pipe pieces and the deposits were dispersed into the phosphate buffered solution pbs for detecting seventeen hydrolyzed amino acids aas and colonies number the extracellular polymeric substance eps in mn deposits were obtained by ultrasonication centrifugation method developed by previous studies jia et al 2017 you et al 2015 the detailed extraction procedures are described in text s2 biofilm eps is categorized as slime eps seps and bound eps jia et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 bound eps consists of two layers the inner layer is tightly bound eps tb eps while the outer layer is loosely bound eps lb eps xing et al 2020 all eps samples were prepared in triplicate confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm zeiss lsm880 germany scanning electron microscope sem nova nanosem 450 america atomic force microscopy afm bruker germany x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo scientific america and x ray diffraction xrd rigaku corporation japan were used to explore the morphological and compositional characteristics of the mn deposits collected on the 150th day 0 5 0 5 cm pipe pieces were stained in situ and characterized with clsm 0 3 0 3 cm thin pipe pieces from freeze dried pipe sections were obtained for sem analysis and afm analysis the pipe pieces for clsm afm and sem analysis were all cut from the bottom parts of the pe pipes before pe pipe sampling the cutter was sterilized with alcohol mn deposits in 15 cm freeze dried pe pipes were scraped for xrd and xps analysis moreover after the experiments ran for 165 days the mn deposits exposed to 1 0 mg l free chlorine were collected in the same way for xps analysis 2 3 beaker experiments in order to further explore the influence of mn on i thms formation in pipe experiments the formation of hoi oi the main active product leading to i thms from i was studied under the following beaker experiments i the chlorination of mn ii with preformed mnox ii the chlorination of mn ii without preformed mnox iii the chlorination with preformed mnox but without mn ii and iv the chlorination without mn ii and preformed mnox the preformed mnox in i and iii was obtained by oxidizing 2 mg l mn ii with 4 5 mg l free chlorine in 1 l ultrapure water for 50 h the ultrapure water was kept at ph 7 8 0 1 with carbonate buffer and naoh or hcl adjustment in glass beakers under rapid magnetic agitation then free chlorine concentration was adjusted to 4 5 mg l once again in i and iii with formed mnox and the same concentration of free chlorine was added to 1 l ultrapure water in two glass beakers for ii and iv experiments ph was adjusted to 7 8 0 1 in four beaker experiments the hoi oi formation was initiated by adding fresh 2 5 mg l i and 2 5 mg l mn ii solutions to reactors the dosage of free chlorine i and mn ii were relatively high in beaker experiments because low i concentration would yield low hoi oi that is not sufficient for characterization during each experiment the water samples at selected times were prepared as follows a 4 ml water sample filtered through a 0 22 μm filter was collected and 1 hno3 was added for dissolving mn a 4 ml water sample filtered with 0 45 μm filter was put into a centrifuge tube with excess phenol and shaken to generate iodophenol for testing hoi oi all experiments in this study were conducted in duplicate at room temperature 25 1 c the details of thmfp experiments are provided in text s3 2 4 analytical methods the detection details of conventional water quality parameters are given in text s4 and the results of sand filtered water influent water of pipe experiments are given in table s1 for the determination of thms water samples were extracted with methyl tert butyl ether mtbe and analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with an electronic capture detector gc ecd agilent 7890b america and an hp 5 fused silica capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm agilent america the details of the detection methods are provided in table s2 for seventeen kinds of hydrolyzed aas analysis the detection details are described in text s5 iodophenol formed by hoi oi and phenol was quantified by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1260 america the detection details of iodophenol are given in text s6 the zeta potentials of three types of eps samples were determined using a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms nexion 300 perkinelmer and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes shimadzu 9800 japan were used to quantify the mn concentrations clsm was used to visualize the spatial distributions of proteins polysaccharides and total cells including live and inactivated cells in mn deposits on inner walls of gradient mn ii concentrations systems cona cw fitc and syto 63 were used to label the α polysaccharides β polysaccharides proteins and total cells respectively in the deposits in this study chen et al 2007 chen et al 2006 yu et al 2011 the staining details are described in text s7 and the excitation and emission wavelengths of each dye are listed in table s3 the quantitative parameters of α polysaccharides β polysaccharides proteins and total cells according to the area coverage were obtained with zeiss confocal software zen black edition in addition elastic modulus young s modulus e of freeze dried deposits on inner walls were estimated by afm the details are provided in text s8 3 results and discussion 3 1 the thm profile in effluent water of pe pipes during pipe experiments the concentrations of regulated thms or i thms in the effluents of gradient mn systems with chlorination were tested regularly the thm concentration in the influent of pe pipes was 7 1 1 3 μg l during the pipe experiments which was due to the disinfection reactions prior to entering pipes fig 2 shows the percent differences of regulated thm concentrations from the first day to the 150th day and the concentrations of i thms in effluents of gradient mn systems with 50 μg l i 151 157 days and 200 μg l i 158 165 days taking the mn free system as a reference when influent water contained 100 μg l mn ii the average concentration of regulated thms was 18 3 μg l on the 150th day increased from 10 9 μg l on the first day while there was no mn ii the average concentration of regulated thms was 15 0 μg l on the 150th day in the effluent of pipe experiments increased from 12 5 μg l on the first day compared with the mn free system the percent difference of regulated thms concentration in 100 μg l mn system on the first day was 13 which could be attributed to the consumption of free chlorine due to oxidation of mn ii however the regulated thms concentration in 100 μg l mn system on the150th day was 22 higher than mn free system and the percent differences were 12 higher for 50 μg l mn system the results of the paired samples t test indicated that the difference of regulated thm concentrations between the 100 μg l mn system and mn free system was significant p 0 02 from 50 to 150 days given the high cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of i dbps the pipe experiments simulated the formation of i thms when mn systems contained i after 150 day study of regulated thms the concentrations of i thms increased in mn systems contained 50 μg l i 151 157 day and 200 μg l i 158 165 day compared with mn free system in fig 2 as the mn ii concentration increased in influent water more i thms formed with dicm accounting for the highest proportion in 100 μg l mn system with 50 μg l i the i thms concentration was 32 more than that in mn free system i thms increased by 23 after i concentration was increased from 50 μg l to 200 μg l clearly the presence of mn increased the risk of i thms in addition the average values of colonies number microbiological water quality indicators turbidity and dissolved organic carbon doc in effluent exhibited an increasing trend with the increase of mn ii concentration in influent water during 150 days fig s2 the correlation analysis indicated that there were significant positive correlations between mn ii concentration in influent water and the average values of colonies number r 0 99 p 0 01 turbidity r 0 97 p 0 00 doc r 0 73 p 0 00 in effluent water when the pipe experiments were operated in 130 days the thmfps of mn deposits in 0 μg l 10 μg l 50 μg l and 100 μg l mn systems are shown in fig s3 the thmfp of mn deposits in 100 μg l mn system was the highest and the thmfp of mn deposits increased with the increased mn ii concentration in influent water of pipe experiment it was inferred that the characteristic and composition of mn deposits might enhance the thm formation in the effluents of pipe experiments 3 2 the characteristic of mn deposits 3 2 1 formation of mn deposits fig 3 depicts the temporal variations of total and dissolved mn concentrations in pipe experiments with gradient mn ii concentrations as the operating time elapsed the concentrations of total and dissolved mn in the effluent decreased indicating that mn deposits were gradually formed fig 3a b c moreover the mnox the difference between total and dissolved mn in effluents of gradient mn systems increased during later stage when mn deposits formed already it was consistent with previous studies that rapid catalytic oxidation reactions of mn ii will occur in the presence of mnox allard et al 2013 li et al 2020a in addition the consumptions of free chlorine between the influents and effluents of pe pipes with gradient mn ii concentrations would increase as operating time of pipe experiments extended taking chlorinated system with 100 μg l mn ii as an example the consumption of free chlorine on the first day was 0 23 0 03 mg l however the consumption increased to 0 36 0 06 mg l on the 150th day therefore mnox showed a rapider deposition behavior during later stage of the experiments due to the rapid catalytic oxidation of mn ii resulting in increased free chlorine consumption in terms of nondisinfected system with 100 μg l mn ii fig 3d the constant concentrations of total and dissolved mn in the effluent during 150 days indicated that the biological oxidation process was slow probably because the inner wall of pe pipe was not conducive to the enrichment of the mn related microorganisms 3 2 2 the morphology of mn deposits inner walls of nondisinfected pe pipe with 100 μg l mn ii and chlorinated pe pipe with 100 μg l mn ii are shown in fig s4 a series of enlarged sem images under different experiment conditions with or without free chlorine 100 μg l and 50 μg l mn ii are shown in fig s5 loose deposits were formed in nondisinfected system with 100 μg l mn ii and there were apparent nodules with pores in the deposits which was consistent with the literature murdoch and smith 1999 in addition fig s5b e c and f represent the relatively tight mn deposits formed by chlorination of 100 μg l and 50 μg l mn ii on inner walls the area covered by mn deposits on inner wall increased with the increase of mn ii concentration in chlorinated influent water to compare the deposits mechanical property the elastic modulus young s modulus e was measured by afm fig 4 the mean value of e in chlorinated mn deposits with 100 μg l mn ii was three times higher than that of nondisinfected mn deposits 430 6 mpa vs 131 4 mpa and the mean value of e in chlorinated mn deposits with 50 μg l mn ii was 211 8 mpa the stiffness of mn deposits significantly increased during free chlorine exposure and the stiffness increased with the increased mn ii concentration in the chlorinated influent water the tight and hard mn deposits were difficult to be removed by pipe network flushing a routine pipe network maintenance measure therefore the effects on the dbp formation in dwds were continuous 3 3 the composition of mn deposits 3 3 1 biomolecules in mn deposits the temporal variations of regulated thms in pe pipes effluents were closely related to the composition of mn deposits on inner walls formed by chlorination of mn ii the xrd pattern of the mn deposits chlorination of 100 μg l mn ii is provided in fig s6 according to the xrd data previously reported the most important metal crystals were manganese dioxide mno2 and calcium carbonate caco3 chen et al 2020 li et al 2020b the results of proteins polysaccharides and total cells in top views of chlorinated mn deposits gradient mn ii concentrations and nondisinfected mn deposits 100 μg l mn ii were determined by clsm in situ on the 150th day fig 5 a b c d e combined with the quantitative results in fig s7 the amounts of proteins α polysaccharides β polysaccharides and total cells increased significantly with the increase of mn deposit area and their amounts in mn deposits formed by chlorination of 100 μg l mn ii were 19 137 17 and 127 times higher than that of deposits without mn ii respectively moreover biomolecules proteins and polysaccharides in chlorinated mn deposits under free chlorine exposure were higher than that of nondisinfected deposits when influent water with 100 μg l mn ii besides the results for total aas were similar with biomolecules quantities by clsm fig s8 the sequence of aas was serine ser asparagine asp glutamic acid glu arginine arg histidine his phenylalanine phe other aas accounting for 28 16 14 7 6 5 and 23 of the total aas respectively in terms of microorganisms in chlorinated mn deposits the amount of total cells including live and inactivated cells increased with the increase of chlorinated mn deposits which was consistent with the result of colonies number fig 5f however the amounts of total cells and colonies number were the opposite in chlorinated and nondisinfected mn deposits 100 μg l mn ii in influent water the amount of total cells in chlorinated mn deposits was higher than that in nondisinfected mn deposits but colonies number in chlorinated mn deposits was lower than that in nondisinfected mn deposits indicating that dead cells inactivated by free chlorine still remained in the chlorinated mn deposits literatures have reported that biomolecules in dwds biofilm can increase thm concentration in tap water hu et al 2021b wang et al 2013 furthermore his gly li et al 2017 alanine ala chu et al 2009 and tryptophan tyr chu et al 2016a have been reported to generate thms during the chlorination process 3 3 2 organic substances in mn deposits within dwds untreated nom has also been linked to enhanced biological instability camper 2004 however the accumulation mechanism of organic matter in deposits of dwds is rarely studied xps analysis was performed to compare the mn deposits formed by 100 μg l mn ii at free chlorine concentrations of 0 45 mg l on the 150th day and 1 0 mg l on the 165th day the mn 2p and c 1 s xps spectra for the mn deposits formed by 0 45 mg l and 1 0 mg l free chlorine are given in fig 6 a b the characteristic peaks of mn 2p in mn deposits were at 642 8 ev and 654 2 ev fig s9a b which were consistent with the peaks of the electronic energy spectra of mn 2p in mno2 lan et al 2019 as shown in fig 6a there were two peaks at binding energy 641 6 and 642 8 ev the components were attributable to the surface mn iii and mn iv species ji et al 2020 peng et al 2020 wang et al 2012a zhang et al 2019 respectively in fig 6b the binding energies at 284 8 ev and 288 7 ev attributed to cc c c and oc o bonds respectively ahmed et al 2018 khan et al 2020 combining fig 6a b when surface mn iii decreased under 1 0 mg l free chlorine on the 165th day the relative intensities of cc c c and oc o also decreased simultaneously the carboxyl groups might come from biomolecules and natural organic matters in raw water esparza soto and westerhoff 2003 wang et al 2012b it was reported that the humic acid and fulvic acid in raw water contained 4 9 and 6 1 mmol cooh g c respectively therefore surface mn iii could play a bridging role between mn deposits and carboxyl organic matter huang et al 2020 liu et al 2009 zhang et al 2021 which enhanced the accumulation of organic substances in mn deposits it was consistent with the results previously reported that mn iii have the potential to form complexes with ligands pyrophosphate edta and citrate under certain natural water conditions klewicki and morgan 1998 madison et al 2011 and according to schulze hardy rule nowicki and nowicka 1994 trivalent ions are more efficient in the linkage process than divalent and single charged ions ca2 mg2 na and k while the increase of free chlorine caused the decrease of the bridging role of mn iii in mn deposits the carboxyl groups in the mn deposits decreased in addition the results of zeta potentials of seps lb eps and tb eps in mn deposits formed by chlorination of gradient mn ii concentrations on the 150th day confirmed the above analysis fig s10 the zeta potentials decreased significantly when mn deposits increased mn ii concentration increased in influent water the compressed electrical double layer decreased the potential energy between mn deposits and organic substances esparza soto and westerhoff 2003 wang et al 2012b resulting in easier functional groups interactions which can be explained by derjaugin landau verwey and overbeek dlvo theory chen et al 2020 hermansson 1999 3 4 mechanism of i thms formation enhanced by mn as mentioned above in the formation of i thms in pipe experiments the presence of mn could increase the i thms formation i thms is formed by the reaction of hoi oi with organic matter when i intrudes chlorinated dwds gong and zhang 2013 i can be oxidized to hoi oi when the concentration of chlorine is relatively low jones et al 2012 however when there is enough free chlorine preformed hoi oi can be further oxidized to iodate io3 ullman et al 1990 since the catalytic oxidation of mn ii consumes free chlorine beaker experiments were conducted to further observe the effects of this process on i thms formation because i thms mainly comes from the nom oxidation by hoi oi this section mainly discussed the generation of hoi oi fig 7 shows the formation of hoi oi from i in the presence and absence of catalytic oxidation of mn ii during chlorination in beaker experiments the corresponding variations in dissolved mn and residual free chlorine concentrations are shown in fig s11a b obviously the production of hoi oi dropped to zero after 20 min under three conditions ii iii and iv chlorination of mn ii in the absence of preformed mnox chlorination of mn ii in the presence of preformed mnox and chlorination without any forms of mn however when mnox formed in situ the concentration of hoi oi could be maintained for 240 min during catalytic oxidation of mn ii i hence the catalytic oxidation of mn ii by mnox resulted in higher hoi oi concentration previous studies can explain above result the reaction rate constant of i and free chlorine to form hoi oi is 4 3 108 m 1 s 1 the reaction rate constant for the subsequent io2 formation from free chlorine and hoi oi is 8 20 m 1 s 1 bichsel and gunten 1999 the reaction rate constant for subsequent io3 formation from io2 and free chlorine is 1 106 m 2 s 1 liu et al 2014 in practical dwds the formation of io3 is a rapid process which can decrease the formation of i dbps however when mnox formed the reaction rate constant of mn ii and free chlorine can increase from 6 4 10 4 m 1 s 1 to 4 106 m 2 s 1 at ph 8 0 allard et al 2013 hence the catalytic oxidation reaction of mn ii could inhibit the oxidation of hoi oi to io3 resulting in more residue of hoi oi accordingly if residual mn ii in finished water enters chlorination dwds the rapid catalytic oxidation reaction of mn ii is initiated by formed mn deposits which would increase the formation of i dbps in tap water in the presence of i free chlorine consumption by catalytic metal oxidation such as mn ii and pb ii oxidation is common in dwds li et al 2020a pan et al 2019 however according to the i dbps formation mechanism when the ratio of the free chlorine concentration to the i concentration is relatively high the disinfectant concentration in dwds is relatively high or the i concentration is relatively low this situation is not applicable previous studies mainly focus on the effects of unlined cast metal pipes and their corrosion products on dbp formation and transformation in drinking water but the influences of residual metal ions in chlorinated dwds are not paid much attention yet particularly dissolved mn ii that is difficult to be removed by traditional water treatment processes could be gradually oxidized into particulate mnox by disinfectant in dwds it is reported that some areas have the problem of water discoloration in tap water caused by formed mnox in dwds whether it is rural or urban kurajica et al 2021 li et al 2019 moreover water flow condition would influence the thickness and hardness of mn deposits on pipe walls shen et al 2016 the deposition of particulate mnox on the pipe wall not only cause the problem of water discoloration in tap water but also the accumulation of microorganisms and organic matter which would inevitably affect the dbp formation and transformation behaviors therefore the practical implications of this study are to reveal the influence of the chlorination and deposition of the residual mn ii in finished water on the generation and transformation of thms which could provide more understanding on the effective control of dbp risks and even together with the discoloration issue control with a more comprehensive strategy from water treatment plant to consumers taps 4 conclusion the present study which revealed that mn in chlorinated dwds gave rise to the dbp risk in tap water can lead to the following conclusions the formation of both regulated thms and i thms could be enhanced by mn chlorination and deposition in chlorinated dwds the accumulation of biomolecules and organic matters which can act as thm precursors could be facilitated by the residence of inactivated cells and the bridging role of mn iii in mn deposits on pipe walls i thms formation was enhanced by the free chlorine competition between catalytic oxidation reaction of mn ii and further oxidation of hoi oi to io3 when mn deposits formed in chlorinated dwds declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing financial interest or personal relationships that could influence the work

16636,uv based water treatment processes have been reported to induce genotoxicity during the treatments of surface water drinking water and artificial water with natural organic matters noms causing genotoxicity concerns for the drinking water safety nitrogenous disinfection byproducts n dbps were generally reported to be much more genotoxic than their non nitrogenous analogues and might be responsible for the genotoxicity in uv processes although nitrate rich water was getting attention for the possibility of genotoxicity and n dbps during uv treatments the impact mechanism of nitrate on the degradation of noms the formation of n dbps and genotoxicity has not been explicated here simulation experiments of nom degradation under medium pressure mp uv and mp uv h2o2 treatments were conducted to explore the effect of nitrate on the molecular characteristics of nom the nitrate derived n dbps and the potential genotoxicity through non targeted analysis and calux reporter gene assays the results showed that nitrate can accelerate the degradation of noms in the mp uv process but inhibit the degradation of noms in the mp uv h2o2 process during the degradation of noms the molecular compositions varied by the effect of nitrate on oxygen atoms molecule analogs and saturation a total of 105 and 374 nitrate derived n dbps were identified in the mp uv and mp uv h2o2 treatment respectively most of these n dbps contain one nitrogen atom and the representative features are nitro methoxy or hydroxyl and ester groups on benzene no genotoxicity was observed without nitrate spiking whereas genotoxicity was induced after both mp uv and mp uv h2o2 treatments when nitrate was spiked which is worthy of attention for the drinking water safety management keywords natural organic matters non targeted analysis nitrogenous disinfection byproducts mp uv treatment genotoxicity 1 introduction uv based technologies have been widely employed in water treatment plants and potable reuse facilities among north america europe and australia trussell et al 2013 uv photolysis and uv h2o2 advanced oxidation are among the most frequently used processes wang et al 2018 which can provide better prospect on both disinfection and control of organic contaminants kruithof et al 2007 however uv and uv h2o2 treatments under practical conditions cannot fully mineralize organic compounds in water and thus disinfection byproducts dbps can be derived from the omni present natural organic matters noms which strongly absorb uvc light 200 285 nm heringa et al 2011 the formation of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts n dbps has raised strong interest because they are often more genotoxic and cytotoxic than many carbonaceous disinfection byproducts c dbps bond et al 2011 richardson et al 2007 shah and mitch 2011 it is known that n dbps can be formed from waters featuring high levels of organic nitrogen during chlorination shah and mitch 2011 but that uv based treatments can incorporate inorganic n e g no3 n into aquatic noms suzuki et al 1987 thorn and cox 2012 vione et al 2001 and n dbps can form from the low nitrogen containing noms remained little known benefiting from ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometric approaches non targeted analysis is able to provide a comprehensive view on water qualities gonsior 2019 although fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms was used to investigate the composition of noms as early as 1997 fievre et al 1997 it was not applied to characterize complex mixtures during water treatments until recently hertkorn et al 2008 kim et al 2019 up to now hundreds of dbps have been identified during drinking water treatments including chlorination chloramination and ozonation processes lavonen et al 2013 liu et al 2020 postigo et al 2016 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2012a zhang et al 2012b zhang et al 2014 however halogenated c dbps were always the subjects and n dbps have received minimal attention among studies involving non targeted analysis zhang et al 2012a only kolkman et al 2015 and vughs et al 2018 investigated the formation of n dbps from pony lake nom under uv treatments and revealed 14 n dbps with nitroaromatic structures but how nitrate affected the degradation of nom and incorporated into n dbps has not been explicated studies have reported that nitrate rich water can exhibit genotoxicity in ames tests under uv treatments and medium pressure mp uv system is more possible to produce genotoxic n dbps than low pressure lp uv system bond et al 2012 ding and chu 2017 kolkman et al 2015 martijn et al 2014 martijn and kruithof 2012 martijn et al 2015 vughs et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 nevertheless the critical role of nitrate on the formation of genotoxicity was never confirmed through controlled experiment and there is still a dearth between the mutagenicity reflected by bacteria and the genotoxicity that can occur in human chemical activated luciferase gene expression calux assay that monitoring the transcriptional activity of human tumor suppressor gene p53 in human u2os cells gives a chance to evaluate human health risk in a relatively realistic scenario sonneveld et al 2005 van der linden et al 2014 zlokarnik et al 1998 to illustrate the effect of nitrate on the formation of n dbps and genotoxicity in the uv treatments of noms simulated experiments of mp uv and mp uv h2o2 treatments for nitrate both 15n labeled and unlabeled spiked water were conducted using phosphate buffer with suwannee river nom the composition of nom and n dbps were firstly characterized identified and compared between samples with and without nitrate using ft icr ms then the genotoxicity risk was evaluated via p53 calux assay both with and without metabolic activation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals the suwannee river nom reverse osmosis isolated 2r101n was purchased from the international humic substances society

mp uv h2o2 treatments mp uv and mp uv h2o2 experiments were conducted on artificial water samples consisted of a 3 mg l suwannee river nom 1 5 mg c l in 20 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 b 3 mg l suwannee river nom and 10 mg l nitrate no3 in 20 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 nitrate was added to phosphate buffer as na14no3 and na15no3 respectively concentrations of nom and nitrate were chosen at environmental level control samples were also prepared i e phosphate buffer that does not contain noms with or without nitrate respectively 24 l artificial water samples were treated with a fluence of 800 mj cm2 mp uv 200 300 nm with without spiking 6 mg l h2o2 in a calgon carbon uv technologies rayox oxidation pilot system volume capacity 40 l respectively each experiment was conducted in triplicates and 2 l water samples were collected before and after mp uv and mp uv h2o2 treatments degradation kinetics of nom and nitrate were investigated via a supplementary experiment the aforementioned concentrations were used in preparing artificial water and 200 ml of samples were collected at time intervals of 15 s 30 s and 60 s during a 300 s mp uv or mp uv h2o2 treatment instead of the specified 800 mj cm2 the uv doses delivered to the treated water were calculated based on the uv path length exposure time and the absorbance of the water by the method established by calgon carbon corporation bircher 2015 using the following equation d λ 200 nm 300 nm d 1 d n p e λ r λ f i v 1 10 a λ d i a λ ln 10 t where d is the uv dose mj cm2 p e λ is the total radiant power at wavelength λ entering the water r λ is the relative absorption coefficient of the oxidant or photoactive species at wavelength λ to that at 254 nm f i is the fraction of uv with path length d i a λ is

samples was solid phase extracted with waters oasis hlb cartridge 500 mg 6 ml the cartridge was activated by mtbe methanol and milli q water successively water samples were loaded at approximately 5 ml min afterwards after desalted by milli q water and completely dried under gentle n2 the cartridges were eluted by 10 ml methanol mtbe v v 8 2 the eluent was concentrated under gentle n2 and make up to a final volume of 1 ml with methanol a volume of 200 μl sample in methanol were used for the analysis by ft icr ms and the remaining 800 μl were solvent replaced to 80 μl of dmso yielding 10 000 fold concentrated extracts which were further applied in the calux bioassays samples without processing and from the degradation kinetics experiments were applied for the determination of environmental parameters total organic carbon toc was measured by shimadzu toc l as non purgeable organic carbon npoc fluorescent excitation emission matrix eem data were acquired from horiba aqualog fluorometer and processed through matlab as previously described park and snyder 2018 uv absorbance at 254 nm uva254 and total fluorescence tf were calculated accordingly concentrations of nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 were measured through ion chromatography ic metrohm 850 professional switzerland 2 4 ft icr ms analysis samples reserved in methanol were analyzed by a bruker ultrashield plus ft icr ms instrument equipped with a 9 4 t superconducting magnet in the esi mode all samples were injected into the instrument continuously at a flow rate of 120 μl h to avoid cross contamination the injection system was washed with methanol water v v 50 50 and methanol between each injection the esi spray voltage was set to 3 4 kv and ion accumulation time was 0 02 s dry gas flow and nebulizer gas flow were 5 l min and 2 bar respectively dry temperature was set at 200 c and the detection mode was the broadband mode with a 4 m size mass spectra were obtained by accumulating 50 scans per sample in a mass range of 77 1200 with a resolution of 252 000 full width at half maximum fwhm of 0 001449 and signal to noise ratio s n of 292 at m z 354 the instrument was externally calibrated using sodium trifluoroacetate homologous series na n 1 cf3co2 n n 1 8 before sample injection and the mass errors were below 0 2 ppm after calibration interferent masses were screened by monitoring solvent blanks methanol n 3 and laboratory blanks extracts of phosphate buffer n 3 and were excluded for further data interpretation the molecular formulas of the acquired m z peaks were assigned by bruker data analysis software the composition of the elements was set to c h o n s only according to the elemental composition report of the suwannee river nom released by ihss 2019 the number of each element in the molecular formula was limited at c1 100 h1 200 o1 50 n0 5 s0 1 double bond equivalent dbe was set in the range of 0 40 all assigned formulas had to meet three chemical criteria liu et al 2020 1 0 3 h c 2 25 2 0 o c 1 2 3 0 dbe c 1 to ensure that the formulas are chemically feasible for visual graphic display of the obtained spectra molecule description tools such as van krevelen diagram and kendrick mass defect kmd plots were further applied the variability amongst all the samples was assessed using bray curtis dissimilarity analysis of all formulas detected in the esi mode 2 5 15n dbp identification figure s1 s indicates the supporting information here and thereafter depicts the strategy using stable isotope 15n to trace n dbps derived from nitrate a and b represent the same n dbp formed under 15no3 and 14no3 spiking respectively c background i e the sample before mp uv treatment when 15n is incorporated into a newly formed n dbp using nitrate as nitrogen source under mp uv or mp uv h2o2 treatment the accurate mass spectrum shows a mass difference of 0 997 da compared to the same n dbp formed in the presence of 14no3 kolkman et al 2015 as indicated by the m z between m z 199 00167 and m z 198 00470 in figure s1 this mass difference is used to screen the raw spectra data for n dbps derived from no3 n dbps derived from organic nitrogen do not show the specific mass difference and can therefore be distinguished from nitrate source n dbps 2 6 in vitro calux reporter gene assays the calux p53 reporter gene cell lines were obtained from biodetection systems b v amsterdam the netherlands and the in vitro assay was conducted as previously described liu et al 2021 to test the potential genotoxicity induced by mp uv treatments briefly cultured p53 u2os cell lines were seeded in 96 well plates and incubated at 37 c for 48 h after incubation the test samples and reference compounds actinomycin d and cyclophosphamide were added at a final concentration of 1 dmso for p53 and p53 with metabolic activation assay respectively the metabolic activation was performed by spiking the phenobarbital pb β naphthoflavone bnf induced s9 liver fraction from sprague dawley rats after 21 h of culture all doses were tested in triplicates on each plate after exposed for a total of 24 h the cells were harvested and luciferin reagent was added prior to measuring the luciferase activity using the flexstation 3 molecular devices usa on all plates a plate specific dose response curve consisted of the reference compounds was included with the solvent dmso acting as the solvent blank an induction coefficient was calculated light unit of sample solvent blank and samples with induction coefficient significantly higher than the control group i e extracts of phosphate buffer were considered positive no cytotoxicity of samples was observed at the present dilution coefficient 2 7 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics version 22 0 spss chicago usa data were analyzed by kolmogorov smirnov test for normality and by levene s test for homogeneity of variances in case where the data in all groups followed a gaussian distribution a student s t test two tailed or one way anova followed by games howell or lsd multiple comparisons were carried out the significant level was set to 0 05 unless otherwise indicated 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of nitrate on optical properties optical properties provide a simple way to assess the overall change of noms during treatments maizel and remucal 2017a the excitation emission matrix eem plots of samples with and without nitrate spiking were presented as fig 1 to illustrate the effect of nitrate on the decomposition of nom during mp uv and mp uv h2o2 treatments in fig 1 two parameters uva254 and total fluorescence tf were presented as well uva254 represents the absorption of uv light at 254 nm reflecting the change of aromatic and conjugated double bond structures of noms yu et al 2015 as shown in fig 1 suwannee river nom can be minimally degraded under mp uv solely but the presence of nitrate can slightly enhance the reduction of uva254 after 800 mj cm2 of mp uv treatment in contrast nitrate impeded the attenuation of uva254 in mp uv h2o2 treatment with the reduction ratio of uva254 10 higher in samples without nitrate this may be due to the competition of uv fluence between nitrate and h2o2 after absorbing uv fluence nitrate can form nitrite which will consume the oh generated by uv h2o2 consequently lowering the oh that nom can utilize martijn et al 2014 although less than 1 of the aromatic moieties in noms actually emit light as fluorophores total fluorescence tf is at least an order of magnitude more sensitive than uv absorbance leenheer and croué 2003 thus tf was also measured and calculated according to the eem plot and presented in fig 1 similar to uva254 a decrease in the tf of suwannee river nom was observed 5 9 65 indicating a distinct degradation of nom a significantly higher decrease 26 of tf was observed in the direct uv treated samples with nitrate compared to a slight reduction 5 9 in samples without nitrate the decomposition of nom was accentuated with the presence of h2o2 however the change of tf in the samples without nitrate was much more dramatic 65 vs 5 9 than samples with nitrate 36 vs 26 when h2o2 was present as illustrated in fig 1 these results indicate that nitrate may function as h2o2 in promoting the degradation of nom under mp uv photolysis but may significantly affect the function of h2o2 as oh supplier in the mp uv h2o2 process which impeded the ring opening and decomposition processes of nom consequently similar result was observed when analyzing the variation of toc during uv treatments figure s2 and photolysis experiments of nitrate nom nitrate nom with without the addition of h2o2 were carried out to explain this result fig 2 illustrated an overall linear decreasing of nitrate accompanied by the linear increasing of nitrite as a function of the uv fluence during treatments the reduction of no3 and the formation of no2 were both more rapidly when nom was present i e nomcan promote the transformation of n from no3 to no2 which can be explained by the following eq 1 to 4 goldstein and rabani 2007 martijn et al 2014 1 no 3 h v n o 2 o 2 no 3 h v ono o no o 2 3 no n o 2 n 2 o 3 h 2 2 no 2 4 no 3 h v no 2 o when the uv wavelength is greater than 195 nm the main photolysis product of no3 in water becomes no2 mainly through the two pathways shown in eq 1 to 4 namely pathway i eq 1 to 3 and pathway ii eq 4 when the wavelength is less than 280 nm the excitation of the π π bond shown in eq 1 and 2 mainly occurs and only when the wavelength is greater than 280 nm the excitation of the n π bond shown in eq 4 occurs goldstein and rabani 2007 in view of the fact that the uv wavelength used in this study is between 200 and 275 nm the conversion of nitrate to nitrite is mainly through pathway i when nom was present it consumed a large amount of the active oxygen radical anions o and o2 during nitrate converting and the reaction consequently proceeded to the right generating more no2 and no thereby promoting the production of no2 this process also explains how no3 promoted the degradation of noms in the uv process by generating more free radicals as shown in fig 2 a the decreasing of no3 significantly slowed when h2o2 was present i e h2o2 can suppress the transformation of n from no3 to no2 this may be explained by the competition between h2o2 and no3 for uv light as well as the oxidation of no2 to no3 these effects were shown on the formation of no2 as well no no2 was observed when the uv fluence was less than 325 mj cm2 in the sample with nom and h2o2 fig 2 b however the result became contradictory when higher uv fluence was applied the concentration of no2 was significantly higher in the sample with nom and h2o2 which might be because nom consumed more oxygen radicals than nitrogen radicals and thus no2 was accumulated meanwhile affected by the competition of no3 on uv light the effect of h2o2 was hindered therefore the degradation of nom was suppressed by nitrate in the uv h2o2 process under 800 mj cm2 of uv fluence 3 2 variation of nom molecular compositions according to the mass spectra acquired from ft icr ms in esi mode an average number of 764 1245 unique molecular formulas were identified in each sample the formulas composed solely of c h and o with without s are dominant in samples without nitrate spiking comprising 70 9 81 1 of all identified formulas while cho s and chon s formula each takes half portion in samples with nitrate 3 2 1 oxygen number and dbe all the compounds with assigned formulas were grouped to 19 kinds based on the oxygen number 1 19 and the molecular numbers in each group were presented in figure s3 the distribution of the total molecule number towards oxygen number fits in a gaussian distribution kolmogorov smirnov test α 0 05 with the majority distributing in the o5 13 species and over 70 molecules in species with 8 10 o atoms the number of cho s molecules under each oxygen species mostly presented a decreasing trend after uv and uv h2o2 treatments and molecules with over 14 oxygen were eliminated in a higher extent a significant increasing of chon s molecules with 11 16 o atoms was observed in samples without nitrate after treatments which presumably was converted from the chon s molecules with lower oxygen numbers based on the decreasing trend of these molecules on the contrary numbers of chon s molecules with 3 8 o atoms increased significantly in samples with nitrate after treatments while molecules with higher oxygen numbers decreased the newly formed chon s in o3 8 species may come from the transformation of high oxygen number chon s as well as from the incorporation of nitrate nitrogen to cho s molecules the molecular composition was further characterized by the dbe values table s1 overall in samples without nitrate spiking the dbe values of both chon s and cho s molecules remained constant or slightly decreased for nitrate spiked samples dbe values were observed decreasing in cho s molecules while increasing in chon s molecules after uv treatments integrating the oxygen number variation results aforementioned it can be referred that nitrogen containing compounds with higher unsaturation degree and 3 8 o atoms were formed in samples spiked with nitrate unexpectedly the dbe values of chon s molecules between uv0 and uv0 nitrate presented significantly differences either in average 13 8 12 8 or median 11 5 10 5 values which potentially is due to the reaction between nom and nitric acid derived from nitrate under low ph during sample preparation this phenomenon was described previously as thorn and cox 2012 found that nitrogen content increased by 2 5 fold while the carbon nitrogen ratio c n decreased from 47 7 to 15 0 after the reaction of suwannee river nom with nitric acid 3 2 2 molecular composition to visualize formulas and link distribution regions to different compound groups liu et al 2020 van krevelen diagrams were presented using data from each triplicate in which the h c ratio for each formula was plotted versus its o c ratio fig 3 most molecules were distributed in the range of 0 3 o c 0 8 and 0 67 h c 1 5 in all samples indicating lignin or tannins derived structures this result agrees with that terrestrially derived aquatic noms are generally comprised of lignin and tannins like compounds as reported previously hertkorn et al 2008 liu et al 2020 maizel and remucal 2017b among the seven distribution regions lignin like compounds are the predominant the number of which relatively decreased after treatments similar decreasing trends were observed for tannins like compounds and condensed aromatics while molecules increased in the other four groups in both sample types except the carbohydrate region in fig 3 b1 b3 before mp uv and mp uv h2o2 treatments the total molecule numbers of seven regions are among 856 1080 but decreased to around 700 after treatments suggesting that mp uv and mp uv h2o2 treatments mineralized a portion of nom specifically cho s molecules presented similar patterns among all the samples the number of cho s molecules in seven regions mostly decreased after treatments except for lipid like compounds which increased by 3 9 fold and 2 3 fold in samples with nitrate and without respectively lignin like compounds accounted for over 65 of cho s molecules the proportion of which decreased after mp uv and mp uv h2o2 treatments in nitrate spiked samples whereas increased in samples without nitrate suggesting the effect of nitrate on the decomposition and formation of lignin like compounds with cho s formulas unlike the predominant number of lignin like compounds among cho s molecules chon s molecules are almost evenly distributed in three regions i e lignin like tannins like and condensed aromatics after treatments the number of chon s molecules increased in all seven regions except condensed aromatics and carbohydrates in some samples the proportions of these two kinds of chon s molecules presented different changes after treatments between samples with and without nitrate the proportion of condensed aromatics increased significantly in samples with nitrate while decreased in samples without and carbohydrates presented the opposite variation pattern indicating the formation of nitrogen containing condensed aromatics after treatments the average and median values of the h c ratio and o c ratio of chon s molecules cho s molecules and total molecules were summarized in table s2 and tables s3 respectively in samples without nitrate h c values significantly increased after uv treatments regardless of the molecule type table s2 indicating the aromatization of nom weakened which is consistent with the aforementioned changes of dbe uva254 and tf the o c values presented an overall constant trend after treatments while increased in chon s molecules but decreased in cho s molecules this trend coincides the aforementioned result that cho s molecules with high oxygen number were eliminated and chon s molecules with high oxygen number were formed the variation trend is pretty different for samples spiked with nitrate the h c values decreased after uv treatment but increased after uv h2o2 treatment due to the significantly higher initial values of uv0 nitratecompared with uv0 suggesting the non negligible effect of nitrate on the saturation of nom under low ph the distribution of o c in chon s molecules distinctly shifted toward the lower values after uv treatments fig 3 b1 b3 which was reflected in table s3 as the lower o c values this agreed with the result described in figure s3 that chon s molecules in o3 8 species significantly increased while molecules with higher oxygen numbers decreased after treatments 3 2 3 sample dissimilarity the variability of formulas amongst the samples was further assessed using bray curtis dissimilarity analysis based on the oxygen number species and formula distribution regions as shown in fig 4 a and 4 b respectively overall all samples were clustered into two groups by the sample type with nitrate and without and distinct differences were observed between treated samples and untreated while the treatment method mp uv or mp uv h2o2 played a minimal role in causing the differences this result confirmed the effect of nitrate on the molecular compositions of artificial water samples during uv treatments this variation can be explained by the composition shown by the oxygen species figure s3 and the van krevelen diagrams fig 3 uv0 nitrate cannot be clustered into either group when analyzed according to the formula distribution region fig 4 b due to the effect of nitric acid as aforementioned presumably nitric acid minimally affected the distribution of oxygen species according to the distinct clustering when using oxygen number as the criterion fig 4 a in summary the presence of nitrate can greatly affect the molecular composition of nom during mp uv treatments including o atom distributions molecule analogs and double bond equivalents nitrogen containing condensed aromatics with higher unsaturation degree and 3 8 o atoms were proposed to be formed after uv treatments when nitrate was present 3 3 characteristics of nitrate derived n dbps 3 3 1 overall characteristics here 15n labeled nitrate was used to trace nitrate derived n dbps figure s1 and a total of 105 and 374 n dbps were identified in the mp uv and mp uv h2o2 treatment respectively these n dbps were further divided into chon chon2 chon3 chon4 and chon5 groups based on n numbers and the molecule numbers in each group were listed in table s4 as sum molecules without s element molecules with s element the identified n dbps presented similar distribution patterns in mp uv and mp uv h2o2 treatments 1 chon group had an absolute advantage in the five groups accounting for 86 7 and 74 8 of all the n dbps produced by the uv process and the uv h2o2 process respectively 2 molecules in chon2 4 groups were very limited and no molecule in chon3 group was formed under uv h2o2 treatment 3 chon5 group was the second predominant this distribution pattern highly agreed with a previous research on the molecule characteristics of suwannee river fulvic acid herzsprung et al 2014 molecule composition of the identified n dbps was further characterized by the kendrick mass defect kmd plots figure s4 kendrick 1963 sleighter and hatcher 2007 all the n dbp molecules presented an obvious diagonal distribution the kmd ch2 value of each molecule increased with the increase of nominal kendrick mass nkm probably due to the increasing of dbe and oxygen atoms with nkm stenson et al 2003 within the 95 confidence level the kmd values of the chon molecules presented a significant positive correlation with its kendrick nominal mass this strong linear pattern has not been found in previous researches and the kmd plots in most studies did not show a similar distribution trend only two studies showed a distinct diagonal kmd plot as this research stenson et al 2003 yang et al 2017 but because no correlation analysis was conducted whether it is a linear distribution remained unknown it is noteworthy that this linear relationship was observed in the chon group and the degree of linearity was greatly reduced while including chon2 5 groups into consideration therefore this linear distribution pattern in the kmd plot might be easier to occur when the molecular composition of the substance of interest is specified 3 3 2 ch2 homologues of chon molecules chon group is the most predominant among all five groups and the only n was undoubtedly acquired from the spiked nitrate which was incorporated into the formed n dbps as a nitro group under the action of uv the kmd plot versus ch2 of all the identified n dbps was sorted based on the carbon number to characterize the ch2 homologues in the chon group which was illustrated in fig 5 as well as the tentatively proposed structures of the representative molecules based on pubchem searching the ch2 homologues of nitrate derived n dbps during mp uv treatment were presented in fig 5 a homologues with kmd 0 193 dbe 6 illustrated the transformation from c7h5no5 c8h7no5 to c9h9no5 during uv treatment via the successive carboxylation of ester group and the hydroxylation of methoxy group the two series of homologues with kmd 0 312 and 0 357 have the same dbe value as well as similar skeletons which are both nitro phenoxy structures the transformation of these homologues followed the same pattern as the former three that is methoxy and ester groups were attacked by oh and gradually evolved into phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups the n dbps formed in the mp uv h2o2 treatment were presented in fig 5 b and the three set of homologues explained in fig 5 a were highlighted by the blue rectangular frames c7h5no6 c8h7no6 and c9h9no6 are homologues with kmd 0 216 dbe 6 with one oxygen over the aforementioned c7h5no5 c8h7no5 and c9h9no5 this oxygen atom was assigned on the benzene ring as a hydroxyl group since the formation of phenolic compounds from noms under uv treatments is quite common because the aromatic structures in noms can be easily attacked by hydroxyl radical oh to generate phenolic hydroxyl groups this effect was also manifested in homologues with kmd 0 253 and kmd 0 388 the methoxy and ester groups of c11h11no7 can finally be transformed into the phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in c8h5no7 the four carboxyl groups on the benzene ring of c14h7no10 may also be the result of the gradual conversion of ester groups under the action of oh in summary the chon type nitrate derived n dbp homologues have similar structures and the representative features are the nitro group methoxy group and ester group on the benzene ring the methoxy and ester groups can be continuously attacked by oh during uv treatments and gradually evolved into phenolic hydroxyl group and carboxyl group respectively considering that both the hydroxy methoxy group and the ester group are electron donating groups they have a strong activation effect on the benzene ring which may promote the electrophilic addition of the nitro group on the nom aromatic ring 3 3 3 o homologues of chon molecules fig 6 illustrated the homologues of nitrate derived n dbps with different o numbers after a mp uv and b mp uv h2o2 treatments as shown in fig 6 a the listed compounds with kmd 0 088 dbe 6 are a series of homologues with a nitro methoxy benzene ring frame and molecules with formulas c8h7no5 and c8h7no6 were also listed in fig 5 a and fig 5 b respectively which can be converted from c8h7no4 through oxidizing aldehyde to carboxylic acid in addition to the hydroxyl electrophilic addition reaction in fact compounds c7h5no5 c8h7no5 c9h9no5 in fig 5 a c7h5no6 c8h7no6 c9h9no6 in fig 5 b and c8h7no4 in fig 6 a can be cross transformed in a system with c8h7no5 as the core and their linkage was depicted in figure s5 similarly compounds with kmd 0 116 dbe 8 in fig 6 a are also a series of homologues with a nitro methoxy benzene ring frame and the molecule c11h9no9 also shown in fig 5 a can be oxidized from c11h9no7 by the addition of phenolic hydroxyl groups to its benzene ring due to the electron donating effect of methoxy group homologues with kmd 0 213 dbe 7 are esters of nitrophenol and alicyclic carboxylic acid which fits in the representative features of nitro methoxy benzene ring as well the o homologues of nitrate derived n dbps in chon group during uv h2o2 treatment were illustrated in fig 6 b with chon5 molecules presented as well two types of molecules showed a clear distinction and chon5 type molecules were concentrated in the high kmd range with 7 12 oxygen atoms c19h15n5o8 and c19h15n5o9 are representative chon5 molecules with kmd 0 224 the difference of which is an o atom between the methyl group and methoxy group homologues with kmd 0 164 contain c15h13no8 and c15h13no10 of which the former can be gradually transformed into the latter through benzene ring opening process under continuous oh attack this series of homologues was also observed in the uv treatment but in a much lower amount because the efficiency of the uv process to generate oh is much lower than that of the uv h2o2 process the quantum yield of radicals in the uv h2o2 process is generally 0 5 2 8 while in uv process this yield is only 0 01 0 05 goldstein et al 2007 wang et al 2018 homologues c10h9no5 c10h9no6 and c10h9no8 with kmd 0 112 dbe 7 illustrated how a carbonyl group and an ester group attached to the nitrobenzene skeleton c10h9no5 evolved into carbonic acid diesters c10h9no8 the difference in the number of o atoms between n dbp homologues is probably because of the electrophilic addition reaction of hydroxyl radicals or the further oxidation of structures containing carbon oxygen double bonds e g ester carbonyl group during treatments 3 4 genotoxicity screening during uv treatments it has been reported that uv based treatments can induce genotoxicity in water heringa et al 2011 found that river waters in the netherlands and the united states showed mutagenicity in the ames ii assay after uv or uv h2o2 treatment using the same bioassay genotoxicities from the uv treatments of pony lake nom and source water in a drinking water facility were observed by martijn et al 2014 and kolkman et al 2015 respectively to investigate the possible genotoxicity during the mp uv and mp uv h2o2 treatments of suwannee river nom and the effect of nitrate in triggering genotoxicity calux luciferase reporter gene assay of human tumor suppressor p53 gene was conducted in this research the results of assay without s9 and with s9 were presented in fig 7 a and b respectively with the genotoxicity scaled by an induction coefficient since phosphate buffer was the sample matrix the extracts of it were analyzed as a control group in the p53 assay without exogenous metabolic activation fig 7 a the induction coefficient of the control group was around 1 indicating that the sample matrix had no additional response however in the assay with exogenous metabolic activation p53 s9 fig 7 b the induction coefficient of the control group was about 1 5 suggesting that the sample matrix itself will cause response and thus the response of treated nom samples need to compare with the control group to be considered positive therefore a sample was considered genotoxic only when significant difference of induction coefficients between the treated sample and the corresponding control group was observed phosphate buffer with nitrate but without noms before and after uv treatments was firstly analyzed and the results showed no significant difference from the control group consequently excluding the possible genotoxicity from the change of nitrate and h2o2 themselves a one way analysis of variance anova was then performed on the induction coefficients of the experimental group uv0 uv800 hp0 and hp800 and the control group in fig 7 a and no difference was observed in samples without no3 p 0 05 while significant difference was observed in the no3 spiked samples p 0 01 further comparison showed that the induction coefficients of samples uv0 and uv800 with nitrate were significantly lower than the control group the reason of which may be that nom and no3 formed substances that promote fluorescence quenching such as fluorescence quencher nitro diazo carboxyl and carbonyl compounds the paired t test was performed on the samples without no3 and with no3 and the induction coefficients did not show a significant difference caused by no3 no significantly positive response was observed among all the samples in the p53 assay without metabolic activation as shown in fig 7 a in fig 7 b the induction coefficient of each sample in the p53 s9 assay showed a large difference the mean values of the induction coefficients of uv800 hp0 and hp800 in the samples with no3 were 2 4 2 0 and 2 5 respectively which were significantly higher than in the control group p 0 05 indicating that 800 mj cm2 of uv fluence can induce genotoxicity under metabolic activation during both mp uv and mp uv h2o2 treatments h2o2 itself also had a certain inducing effect although much lower than that of uv irradiation paired t test on the induction coefficients of samples uv800 hp0 and hp800 all showed significant difference between with no3 and without no3 scenarios in the p53 s9 assay with a p value of 0 019 0 022 0 002 respectively suggesting the critical role of nitrate on the observed genotoxicity it is noteworthy that the concentration of nom 1 5 mg c l used in this study fits in the realistic drinking water source scenario kolkman et al 2015 and the nitrate spiked 2 3 mg n l is even less than the drinking water criterion 10 mg n l regulated by many countries and regions world health organization 2018 it means that genotoxicity might be caused right now in the drinking water facilities using mp uv and mp uv h2o2 processes which is worthy of further evaluation no3 caused no genotoxicity effect when uv and h2o2 were neither applied though non negligible effect was observed on the molecule composition fig 3 4 conclusion a simulation experiment of nom degradation under mp uv and mp uv h2o2 treatments were conducted and the effect of nitrate on the composition variations of nom on the characteristics of nitrate derived n dbps and on the induction of genotoxicity was investigated nitrate can accelerate the degradation of nom in the mp uv process by providing more free radicals but can interfere with h2o2 and thereby inhibit the degradation of nom in the mp uv h2o2 process nitrate affects the decomposition of nom in various aspects including o atom distributions molecule analogs and double bond equivalents nno3 can be incorporated into noms to form n dbps and most of these n dbps contain one nitrogen atom the representative features of which are a nitro group a methoxy group or a phenolic hydroxyl group and an ester group on the benzene ring under continuous oxidation the methoxy and ester groups are attacked by oh and can be evolved into phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups nitrate spiked under realistic environmental concentration can play a critical role on the genotoxicity formation during the mp uv treatments of nom and the genotoxicity in the drinking water facilities using uv processes need to be evaluated the findings in this study have significance for drinking water safety management by suggesting that nitrate played a critical role in triggering genotoxicity and producing n dbps during uv based water treatments additional processes e g post gac might be essential to be performed after mp uv to remove the induced genotoxicity as suggested by heringa et al 2011

16636,uv based water treatment processes have been reported to induce genotoxicity during the treatments of surface water drinking water and artificial water with natural organic matters noms causing genotoxicity concerns for the drinking water safety nitrogenous disinfection byproducts n dbps were generally reported to be much more genotoxic than their non nitrogenous analogues and might be responsible for the genotoxicity in uv processes although nitrate rich water was getting attention for the possibility of genotoxicity and n dbps during uv treatments the impact mechanism of nitrate on the degradation of noms the formation of n dbps and genotoxicity has not been explicated here simulation experiments of nom degradation under medium pressure mp uv and mp uv h2o2 treatments were conducted to explore the effect of nitrate on the molecular characteristics of nom the nitrate derived n dbps and the potential genotoxicity through non targeted analysis and calux reporter gene assays the results showed that nitrate can accelerate the degradation of noms in the mp uv process but inhibit the degradation of noms in the mp uv h2o2 process during the degradation of noms the molecular compositions varied by the effect of nitrate on oxygen atoms molecule analogs and saturation a total of 105 and 374 nitrate derived n dbps were identified in the mp uv and mp uv h2o2 treatment respectively most of these n dbps contain one nitrogen atom and the representative features are nitro methoxy or hydroxyl and ester groups on benzene no genotoxicity was observed without nitrate spiking whereas genotoxicity was induced after both mp uv and mp uv h2o2 treatments when nitrate was spiked which is worthy of attention for the drinking water safety management keywords natural organic matters non targeted analysis nitrogenous disinfection byproducts mp uv treatment genotoxicity 1 introduction uv based technologies have been widely employed in water treatment plants and potable reuse facilities among north america europe and australia trussell et al 2013 uv photolysis and uv h2o2 advanced oxidation are among the most frequently used processes wang et al 2018 which can provide better prospect on both disinfection and control of organic contaminants kruithof et al 2007 however uv and uv h2o2 treatments under practical conditions cannot fully mineralize organic compounds in water and thus disinfection byproducts dbps can be derived from the omni present natural organic matters noms which strongly absorb uvc light 200 285 nm heringa et al 2011 the formation of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts n dbps has raised strong interest because they are often more genotoxic and cytotoxic than many carbonaceous disinfection byproducts c dbps bond et al 2011 richardson et al 2007 shah and mitch 2011 it is known that n dbps can be formed from waters featuring high levels of organic nitrogen during chlorination shah and mitch 2011 but that uv based treatments can incorporate inorganic n e g no3 n into aquatic noms suzuki et al 1987 thorn and cox 2012 vione et al 2001 and n dbps can form from the low nitrogen containing noms remained little known benefiting from ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometric approaches non targeted analysis is able to provide a comprehensive view on water qualities gonsior 2019 although fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms was used to investigate the composition of noms as early as 1997 fievre et al 1997 it was not applied to characterize complex mixtures during water treatments until recently hertkorn et al 2008 kim et al 2019 up to now hundreds of dbps have been identified during drinking water treatments including chlorination chloramination and ozonation processes lavonen et al 2013 liu et al 2020 postigo et al 2016 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2012a zhang et al 2012b zhang et al 2014 however halogenated c dbps were always the subjects and n dbps have received minimal attention among studies involving non targeted analysis zhang et al 2012a only kolkman et al 2015 and vughs et al 2018 investigated the formation of n dbps from pony lake nom under uv treatments and revealed 14 n dbps with nitroaromatic structures but how nitrate affected the degradation of nom and incorporated into n dbps has not been explicated studies have reported that nitrate rich water can exhibit genotoxicity in ames tests under uv treatments and medium pressure mp uv system is more possible to produce genotoxic n dbps than low pressure lp uv system bond et al 2012 ding and chu 2017 kolkman et al 2015 martijn et al 2014 martijn and kruithof 2012 martijn et al 2015 vughs et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 nevertheless the critical role of nitrate on the formation of genotoxicity was never confirmed through controlled experiment and there is still a dearth between the mutagenicity reflected by bacteria and the genotoxicity that can occur in human chemical activated luciferase gene expression calux assay that monitoring the transcriptional activity of human tumor suppressor gene p53 in human u2os cells gives a chance to evaluate human health risk in a relatively realistic scenario sonneveld et al 2005 van der linden et al 2014 zlokarnik et al 1998 to illustrate the effect of nitrate on the formation of n dbps and genotoxicity in the uv treatments of noms simulated experiments of mp uv and mp uv h2o2 treatments for nitrate both 15n labeled and unlabeled spiked water were conducted using phosphate buffer with suwannee river nom the composition of nom and n dbps were firstly characterized identified and compared between samples with and without nitrate using ft icr ms then the genotoxicity risk was evaluated via p53 calux assay both with and without metabolic activation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals the suwannee river nom reverse osmosis isolated 2r101n was purchased from the international humic substances society

1000 μm were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and provided by biodetection systems b v amsterdam the netherlands ultrapure water was obtained from a milli q system millipore billerica ma 2 2 mp uv and mp uv h2o2 treatments mp uv and mp uv h2o2 experiments were conducted on artificial water samples consisted of a 3 mg l suwannee river nom 1 5 mg c l in 20 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 b 3 mg l suwannee river nom and 10 mg l nitrate no3 in 20 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 nitrate was added to phosphate buffer as na14no3 and na15no3 respectively concentrations of nom and nitrate were chosen at environmental level control samples were also prepared i e phosphate buffer that does not contain noms with or without nitrate respectively 24 l artificial water samples were treated with a fluence of 800 mj cm2 mp uv 200 300 nm with without spiking 6 mg l h2o2 in a calgon carbon uv technologies rayox oxidation pilot system volume capacity 40 l respectively each experiment was conducted in triplicates and 2 l water samples were collected before and after mp uv and mp uv h2o2 treatments degradation kinetics of nom and nitrate were investigated via a supplementary experiment the aforementioned concentrations were used in preparing artificial water and 200 ml of samples were collected at time intervals of 15 s 30 s and 60 s during a 300 s mp uv or mp uv h2o2 treatment instead of the specified 800 mj cm2 the uv doses delivered to the treated water were calculated based on the uv path length exposure time and the absorbance of the water by the method established by calgon carbon corporation bircher 2015 using the following equation d λ 200 nm 300 nm d 1 d n p e λ r λ f i v 1 10 a λ d i a λ ln 10 t where d is the uv dose mj cm2 p e λ is the total radiant power at wavelength λ entering the water r λ is the relative absorption coefficient of the oxidant or photoactive species at wavelength λ to that at 254 nm f i is the fraction of uv with path length d i a λ is the absorption coefficient cm 1 of the water at wavelength λ v is the volume of the water d i is the path length 2 3 sample preparation and environmental parameter determination one liter collected samples was solid phase extracted with waters oasis hlb cartridge 500 mg 6 ml the cartridge was activated by mtbe methanol and milli q water successively water samples were loaded at approximately 5

to a final volume of 1 ml with methanol a volume of 200 μl sample in methanol were used for the analysis by ft icr ms and the remaining 800 μl were solvent replaced to 80 μl of dmso yielding 10 000 fold concentrated extracts which were further applied in the calux bioassays samples without processing and from the degradation kinetics experiments were applied for the determination of environmental parameters total organic carbon toc was measured by shimadzu toc l as non purgeable organic carbon npoc fluorescent excitation emission matrix eem data were acquired from horiba aqualog fluorometer and processed through matlab as previously described park and snyder 2018 uv absorbance at 254 nm uva254 and total fluorescence tf were calculated accordingly concentrations of nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 were measured through ion chromatography ic metrohm 850 professional switzerland 2 4 ft icr ms analysis samples reserved in methanol were analyzed by a bruker ultrashield plus ft icr ms instrument equipped with a 9 4 t superconducting magnet in the esi mode all samples were injected into the instrument continuously at a flow rate of 120 μl h to avoid cross contamination the injection system was washed with methanol water v v 50 50 and methanol between each injection the esi spray voltage was set to 3 4 kv and ion accumulation time was 0 02 s dry gas flow and nebulizer gas flow were 5 l min and 2 bar respectively dry temperature was set at 200 c and the detection mode was the broadband mode with a 4 m size mass spectra were obtained by accumulating 50 scans per sample in a mass range of 77 1200 with a resolution of 252 000 full width at half maximum fwhm of 0 001449 and signal to noise ratio s n of 292 at m z 354 the instrument was externally calibrated using sodium trifluoroacetate homologous series na n 1 cf3co2 n n 1 8 before sample injection and the mass errors were below 0 2 ppm after calibration interferent masses were screened by monitoring solvent blanks methanol n 3 and laboratory blanks extracts of phosphate buffer n 3 and were excluded for further data interpretation the molecular formulas of the acquired m z peaks were assigned by bruker data analysis software the composition of the elements was set to c h o n s only according to the elemental composition report of the suwannee river nom released by ihss 2019 the number of each element in the molecular formula was limited at c1 100 h1 200 o1 50 n0 5 s0 1 double bond equivalent dbe was set in the range of 0 40 all assigned formulas had to meet three chemical criteria liu et

diagram and kendrick mass defect kmd plots were further applied the variability amongst all the samples was assessed using bray curtis dissimilarity analysis of all formulas detected in the esi mode 2 5 15n dbp identification figure s1 s indicates the supporting information here and thereafter depicts the strategy using stable isotope 15n to trace n dbps derived from nitrate a and b represent the same n dbp formed under 15no3 and 14no3 spiking respectively c background i e the sample before mp uv treatment when 15n is incorporated into a newly formed n dbp using nitrate as nitrogen source under mp uv or mp uv h2o2 treatment the accurate mass spectrum shows a mass difference of 0 997 da compared to the same n dbp formed in the presence of 14no3 kolkman et al 2015 as indicated by the m z between m z 199 00167 and m z 198 00470 in figure s1 this mass difference is used to screen the raw spectra data for n dbps derived from no3 n dbps derived from organic nitrogen do not show the specific mass difference and can therefore be distinguished from nitrate source n dbps 2 6 in vitro calux reporter gene assays the calux p53 reporter gene cell lines were obtained from biodetection systems b v amsterdam the netherlands and the in vitro assay was conducted as previously described liu et al 2021 to test the potential genotoxicity induced by mp uv treatments briefly cultured p53 u2os cell lines were seeded in 96 well plates and incubated at 37 c for 48 h after incubation the test samples and reference compounds actinomycin d and cyclophosphamide were added at a final concentration of 1 dmso for p53 and p53 with metabolic activation assay respectively the metabolic activation was performed by spiking the phenobarbital pb β naphthoflavone bnf induced s9 liver fraction from sprague dawley rats after 21 h of culture all doses were tested in triplicates on each plate after exposed for a total of 24 h the cells were harvested and luciferin reagent was added prior to measuring the luciferase activity using the flexstation 3 molecular devices usa on all plates a plate specific dose response curve consisted of the reference compounds was included with the solvent dmso acting as the solvent blank an induction coefficient was calculated light unit of sample solvent blank and samples with induction coefficient significantly higher than the control group i e extracts of phosphate buffer were considered positive no cytotoxicity of samples was observed at the present dilution coefficient 2 7 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics version 22 0 spss chicago usa data were analyzed by kolmogorov smirnov test for normality and by levene s test for homogeneity of variances in case where the data in all groups followed a gaussian distribution a student s t test two tailed or one way anova followed by games howell or lsd multiple comparisons were carried out the significant level was set to 0 05 unless otherwise indicated 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of nitrate on optical properties optical properties provide a simple way to assess the overall change of noms during treatments maizel and remucal 2017a the excitation emission matrix eem plots of samples with and without nitrate spiking were presented as fig 1 to illustrate the effect of nitrate on the decomposition of nom during mp uv and mp uv h2o2 treatments in fig 1 two parameters uva254 and total fluorescence tf were presented as well uva254 represents the absorption of uv light at 254 nm reflecting the change of aromatic and conjugated double bond structures of noms yu et al 2015 as shown in fig 1 suwannee river nom can be minimally degraded under mp uv solely but the presence of nitrate can slightly enhance the reduction of uva254 after 800 mj cm2 of mp uv treatment in contrast nitrate impeded the attenuation of uva254 in mp uv h2o2 treatment with the reduction ratio of uva254 10 higher in samples without nitrate this may be due to the competition of uv fluence between nitrate and h2o2 after absorbing uv fluence nitrate can form nitrite which will consume the oh generated by uv h2o2 consequently lowering the oh that nom can utilize martijn et al 2014 although less than 1 of the aromatic moieties in noms actually emit light as fluorophores total fluorescence tf is at least an order of magnitude more sensitive than uv absorbance leenheer and croué 2003 thus tf was also measured and calculated according to the eem plot and presented in fig 1 similar to uva254 a decrease in the tf of suwannee river nom was observed 5 9 65 indicating a distinct degradation of nom a significantly higher decrease 26 of tf was observed in the direct uv treated samples with nitrate compared to a slight reduction 5 9 in samples without nitrate the decomposition of nom was accentuated with the presence of h2o2 however the change of tf in the samples without nitrate was much more dramatic 65 vs 5 9 than samples with nitrate 36 vs 26 when h2o2 was present as illustrated in fig 1 these results indicate that nitrate may function as h2o2 in promoting the degradation of nom under mp uv photolysis but may significantly affect the function of h2o2 as oh supplier in the mp uv h2o2 process which impeded the ring opening and decomposition processes of nom consequently similar result was observed when analyzing the variation of toc during uv treatments figure s2 and photolysis experiments of nitrate nom nitrate nom with without the addition of h2o2 were carried out to explain this result fig 2 illustrated an overall linear decreasing of nitrate accompanied by the linear increasing of nitrite as a function of the uv fluence during treatments the reduction of no3 and the formation of no2 were both more rapidly when nom was present i e nomcan promote the transformation of n from no3 to no2 which can be explained by the following eq 1 to 4 goldstein and rabani 2007 martijn et al 2014 1 no 3 h v n o 2 o 2 no 3 h v ono o no o 2 3 no n o 2 n 2 o 3 h 2 2 no 2 4 no 3 h v no 2 o when the uv wavelength is greater than 195 nm the main photolysis product of no3 in water becomes no2 mainly through the two pathways shown in eq 1 to 4 namely pathway i eq 1 to 3 and pathway ii eq 4 when the wavelength is less than 280 nm the excitation of the π π bond shown in eq 1 and 2 mainly occurs and only when the wavelength is greater than 280 nm the excitation of the n π bond shown in eq 4 occurs goldstein and rabani 2007 in view of the fact that the uv wavelength used in this study is between 200 and 275 nm the conversion of nitrate to nitrite is mainly through pathway i when nom was present it consumed a large amount of the active oxygen radical anions o and o2 during nitrate converting and the reaction consequently proceeded to the right generating more no2 and no thereby promoting the production of no2 this process also explains how no3 promoted the degradation of noms in the uv process by generating more free radicals as shown in fig 2 a the decreasing of no3 significantly slowed when h2o2 was present i e h2o2 can suppress the transformation of n from no3 to no2 this may be explained by the competition between h2o2 and no3 for uv light as well as the oxidation of no2 to no3 these effects were shown on the formation of no2 as well no no2 was observed when the uv fluence was less than 325 mj cm2 in the sample with nom and h2o2 fig 2 b however the result became contradictory when higher uv fluence was applied the concentration of no2 was significantly higher in the sample with nom and h2o2 which might be because nom consumed more oxygen radicals than nitrogen radicals and thus no2 was accumulated meanwhile affected by the competition of no3 on uv light the effect of h2o2 was hindered therefore the degradation of nom was suppressed by nitrate in the uv h2o2 process under 800 mj cm2 of uv fluence 3 2 variation of nom molecular compositions according to the mass spectra acquired from ft icr ms in esi mode an average number of 764 1245 unique molecular formulas were identified in each sample the formulas composed solely of c h and o with without s are dominant in samples without nitrate spiking comprising 70 9 81 1 of all identified formulas while cho s and chon s formula each takes half portion in samples with nitrate 3 2 1 oxygen number and dbe all the compounds with assigned formulas were grouped to 19 kinds based on the oxygen number 1 19 and the molecular numbers in each group were presented in figure s3 the distribution of the total molecule number towards oxygen number fits in a gaussian distribution kolmogorov smirnov test α 0 05 with the majority distributing in the o5 13 species and over 70 molecules in species with 8 10 o atoms the number of cho s molecules under each oxygen species mostly presented a decreasing trend after uv and uv h2o2 treatments and molecules with over 14 oxygen were eliminated in a higher extent a significant increasing of chon s molecules with 11 16 o atoms was observed in samples without nitrate after treatments which presumably was converted from the chon s molecules with lower oxygen numbers based on the decreasing trend of these molecules on the contrary numbers of chon s molecules with 3 8 o atoms increased significantly in samples with nitrate after treatments while molecules with higher oxygen numbers decreased the newly formed chon s in o3 8 species may come from the transformation of high oxygen number chon s as well as from the incorporation of nitrate nitrogen to cho s molecules the molecular composition was further characterized by the dbe values table s1 overall in samples without nitrate spiking the dbe values of both chon s and cho s molecules remained constant or slightly decreased for nitrate spiked samples dbe values were observed decreasing in cho s molecules while increasing in chon s molecules after uv treatments integrating the oxygen number variation results aforementioned it can be referred that nitrogen containing compounds with higher unsaturation degree and 3 8 o atoms were formed in samples spiked with nitrate unexpectedly the dbe values of chon s molecules between uv0 and uv0 nitrate presented significantly differences either in average 13 8 12 8 or median 11 5 10 5 values which potentially is due to the reaction between nom and nitric acid derived from nitrate under low ph during sample preparation this phenomenon was described previously as thorn and cox 2012 found that nitrogen content increased by 2 5 fold while the carbon nitrogen ratio c n decreased from 47 7 to 15 0 after the reaction of suwannee river nom with nitric acid 3 2 2 molecular composition to visualize formulas and link distribution regions to different compound groups liu et al 2020 van krevelen diagrams were presented using data from each triplicate in which the h c ratio for each formula was plotted versus its o c ratio fig 3 most molecules were distributed in the range of 0 3 o c 0 8 and 0 67 h c 1 5 in all samples indicating lignin or tannins derived structures this result agrees with that terrestrially derived aquatic noms are generally comprised of lignin and tannins like compounds as reported previously hertkorn et al 2008 liu et al 2020 maizel and remucal 2017b among the seven distribution regions lignin like compounds are the predominant the number of which relatively decreased after treatments similar decreasing trends were observed for tannins like compounds and condensed aromatics while molecules increased in the other four groups in both sample types except the carbohydrate region in fig 3 b1 b3 before mp uv and mp uv h2o2 treatments the total molecule numbers of seven regions are among 856 1080 but decreased to around 700 after treatments suggesting that mp uv and mp uv h2o2 treatments mineralized a portion of nom specifically cho s molecules presented similar patterns among all the samples the number of cho s molecules in seven regions mostly decreased after treatments except for lipid like compounds which increased by 3 9 fold and 2 3 fold in samples with nitrate and without respectively lignin like compounds accounted for over 65 of cho s molecules the proportion of which decreased after mp uv and mp uv h2o2 treatments in nitrate spiked samples whereas increased in samples without nitrate suggesting the effect of nitrate on the decomposition and formation of lignin like compounds with cho s formulas unlike the predominant number of lignin like compounds among cho s molecules chon s molecules are almost evenly distributed in three regions i e lignin like tannins like and condensed aromatics after treatments the number of chon s molecules increased in all seven regions except condensed aromatics and carbohydrates in some samples the proportions of these two kinds of chon s molecules presented different changes after treatments between samples with and without nitrate the proportion of condensed aromatics increased significantly in samples with nitrate while decreased in samples without and carbohydrates presented the opposite variation pattern indicating the formation of nitrogen containing condensed aromatics after treatments the average and median values of the h c ratio and o c ratio of chon s molecules cho s molecules and total molecules were summarized in table s2 and tables s3 respectively in samples without nitrate h c values significantly increased after uv treatments regardless of the molecule type table s2 indicating the aromatization of nom weakened which is consistent with the aforementioned changes of dbe uva254 and tf the o c values presented an overall constant trend after treatments while increased in chon s molecules but decreased in cho s molecules this trend coincides the aforementioned result that cho s molecules with high oxygen number were eliminated and chon s molecules with high oxygen number were formed the variation trend is pretty different for samples spiked with nitrate the h c values decreased after uv treatment but increased after uv h2o2 treatment due to the significantly higher initial values of uv0 nitratecompared with uv0 suggesting the non negligible effect of nitrate on the saturation of nom under low ph the distribution of o c in chon s molecules distinctly shifted toward the lower values after uv treatments fig 3 b1 b3 which was reflected in table s3 as the lower o c values this agreed with the result described in figure s3 that chon s molecules in o3 8 species significantly increased while molecules with higher oxygen numbers decreased after treatments 3 2 3 sample dissimilarity the variability of formulas amongst the samples was further assessed using bray curtis dissimilarity analysis based on the oxygen number species and formula distribution regions as shown in fig 4 a and 4 b respectively overall all samples were clustered into two groups by the sample type with nitrate and without and distinct differences were observed between treated samples and untreated while the treatment method mp uv or mp uv h2o2 played a minimal role in causing the differences this result confirmed the effect of nitrate on the molecular compositions of artificial water samples during uv treatments this variation can be explained by the composition shown by the oxygen species figure s3 and the van krevelen diagrams fig 3 uv0 nitrate cannot be clustered into either group when analyzed according to the formula distribution region fig 4 b due to the effect of nitric acid as aforementioned presumably nitric acid minimally affected the distribution of oxygen species according to the distinct clustering when using oxygen number as the criterion fig 4 a in summary the presence of nitrate can greatly affect the molecular composition of nom during mp uv treatments including o atom distributions molecule analogs and double bond equivalents nitrogen containing condensed aromatics with higher unsaturation degree and 3 8 o atoms were proposed to be formed after uv treatments when nitrate was present 3 3 characteristics of nitrate derived n dbps 3 3 1 overall characteristics here 15n labeled nitrate was used to trace nitrate derived n dbps figure s1 and a total of 105 and 374 n dbps were identified in the mp uv and mp uv h2o2 treatment respectively these n dbps were further divided into chon chon2 chon3 chon4 and chon5 groups based on n numbers and the molecule numbers in each group were listed in table s4 as sum molecules without s element molecules with s element the identified n dbps presented similar distribution patterns in mp uv and mp uv h2o2 treatments 1 chon group had an absolute advantage in the five groups accounting for 86 7 and 74 8 of all the n dbps produced by the uv process and the uv h2o2 process respectively 2 molecules in chon2 4 groups were very limited and no molecule in chon3 group was formed under uv h2o2 treatment 3 chon5 group was the second predominant this distribution pattern highly agreed with a previous research on the molecule characteristics of suwannee river fulvic acid herzsprung et al 2014 molecule composition of the identified n dbps was further characterized by the kendrick mass defect kmd plots figure s4 kendrick 1963 sleighter and hatcher 2007 all the n dbp molecules presented an obvious diagonal distribution the kmd ch2 value of each molecule increased with the increase of nominal kendrick mass nkm probably due to the increasing of dbe and oxygen atoms with nkm stenson et al 2003 within the 95 confidence level the kmd values of the chon molecules presented a significant positive correlation with its kendrick nominal mass this strong linear pattern has not been found in previous researches and the kmd plots in most studies did not show a similar distribution trend only two studies showed a distinct diagonal kmd plot as this research stenson et al 2003 yang et al 2017 but because no correlation analysis was conducted whether it is a linear distribution remained unknown it is noteworthy that this linear relationship was observed in the chon group and the degree of linearity was greatly reduced while including chon2 5 groups into consideration therefore this linear distribution pattern in the kmd plot might be easier to occur when the molecular composition of the substance of interest is specified 3 3 2 ch2 homologues of chon molecules chon group is the most predominant among all five groups and the only n was undoubtedly acquired from the spiked nitrate which was incorporated into the formed n dbps as a nitro group under the action of uv the kmd plot versus ch2 of all the identified n dbps was sorted based on the carbon number to characterize the ch2 homologues in the chon group which was illustrated in fig 5 as well as the tentatively proposed structures of the representative molecules based on pubchem searching the ch2 homologues of nitrate derived n dbps during mp uv treatment were presented in fig 5 a homologues with kmd 0 193 dbe 6 illustrated the transformation from c7h5no5 c8h7no5 to c9h9no5 during uv treatment via the successive carboxylation of ester group and the hydroxylation of methoxy group the two series of homologues with kmd 0 312 and 0 357 have the same dbe value as well as similar skeletons which are both nitro phenoxy structures the transformation of these homologues followed the same pattern as the former three that is methoxy and ester groups were attacked by oh and gradually evolved into phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups the n dbps formed in the mp uv h2o2 treatment were presented in fig 5 b and the three set of homologues explained in fig 5 a were highlighted by the blue rectangular frames c7h5no6 c8h7no6 and c9h9no6 are homologues with kmd 0 216 dbe 6 with one oxygen over the aforementioned c7h5no5 c8h7no5 and c9h9no5 this oxygen atom was assigned on the benzene ring as a hydroxyl group since the formation of phenolic compounds from noms under uv treatments is quite common because the aromatic structures in noms can be easily attacked by hydroxyl radical oh to generate phenolic hydroxyl groups this effect was also manifested in homologues with kmd 0 253 and kmd 0 388 the methoxy and ester groups of c11h11no7 can finally be transformed into the phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in c8h5no7 the four carboxyl groups on the benzene ring of c14h7no10 may also be the result of the gradual conversion of ester groups under the action of oh in summary the chon type nitrate derived n dbp homologues have similar structures and the representative features are the nitro group methoxy group and ester group on the benzene ring the methoxy and ester groups can be continuously attacked by oh during uv treatments and gradually evolved into phenolic hydroxyl group and carboxyl group respectively considering that both the hydroxy methoxy group and the ester group are electron donating groups they have a strong activation effect on the benzene ring which may promote the electrophilic addition of the nitro group on the nom aromatic ring 3 3 3 o homologues of chon molecules fig 6 illustrated the homologues of nitrate derived n dbps with different o numbers after a mp uv and b mp uv h2o2 treatments as shown in fig 6 a the listed compounds with kmd 0 088 dbe 6 are a series of homologues with a nitro methoxy benzene ring frame and molecules with formulas c8h7no5 and c8h7no6 were also listed in fig 5 a and fig 5 b respectively which can be converted from c8h7no4 through oxidizing aldehyde to carboxylic acid in addition to the hydroxyl electrophilic addition reaction in fact compounds c7h5no5 c8h7no5 c9h9no5 in fig 5 a c7h5no6 c8h7no6 c9h9no6 in fig 5 b and c8h7no4 in fig 6 a can be cross transformed in a system with c8h7no5 as the core and their linkage was depicted in figure s5 similarly compounds with kmd 0 116 dbe 8 in fig 6 a are also a series of homologues with a nitro methoxy benzene ring frame and the molecule c11h9no9 also shown in fig 5 a can be oxidized from c11h9no7 by the addition of phenolic hydroxyl groups to its benzene ring due to the electron donating effect of methoxy group homologues with kmd 0 213 dbe 7 are esters of nitrophenol and alicyclic carboxylic acid which fits in the representative features of nitro methoxy benzene ring as well the o homologues of nitrate derived n dbps in chon group during uv h2o2 treatment were illustrated in fig 6 b with chon5 molecules presented as well two types of molecules showed a clear distinction and chon5 type molecules were concentrated in the high kmd range with 7 12 oxygen atoms c19h15n5o8 and c19h15n5o9 are representative chon5 molecules with kmd 0 224 the difference of which is an o atom between the methyl group and methoxy group homologues with kmd 0 164 contain c15h13no8 and c15h13no10 of which the former can be gradually transformed into the latter through benzene ring opening process under continuous oh attack this series of homologues was also observed in the uv treatment but in a much lower amount because the efficiency of the uv process to generate oh is much lower than that of the uv h2o2 process the quantum yield of radicals in the uv h2o2 process is generally 0 5 2 8 while in uv process this yield is only 0 01 0 05 goldstein et al 2007 wang et al 2018 homologues c10h9no5 c10h9no6 and c10h9no8 with kmd 0 112 dbe 7 illustrated how a carbonyl group and an ester group attached to the nitrobenzene skeleton c10h9no5 evolved into carbonic acid diesters c10h9no8 the difference in the number of o atoms between n dbp homologues is probably because of the electrophilic addition reaction of hydroxyl radicals or the further oxidation of structures containing carbon oxygen double bonds e g ester carbonyl group during treatments 3 4 genotoxicity screening during uv treatments it has been reported that uv based treatments can induce genotoxicity in water heringa et al 2011 found that river waters in the netherlands and the united states showed mutagenicity in the ames ii assay after uv or uv h2o2 treatment using the same bioassay genotoxicities from the uv treatments of pony lake nom and source water in a drinking water facility were observed by martijn et al 2014 and kolkman et al 2015 respectively to investigate the possible genotoxicity during the mp uv and mp uv h2o2 treatments of suwannee river nom and the effect of nitrate in triggering genotoxicity calux luciferase reporter gene assay of human tumor suppressor p53 gene was conducted in this research the results of assay without s9 and with s9 were presented in fig 7 a and b respectively with the genotoxicity scaled by an induction coefficient since phosphate buffer was the sample matrix the extracts of it were analyzed as a control group in the p53 assay without exogenous metabolic activation fig 7 a the induction coefficient of the control group was around 1 indicating that the sample matrix had no additional response however in the assay with exogenous metabolic activation p53 s9 fig 7 b the induction coefficient of the control group was about 1 5 suggesting that the sample matrix itself will cause response and thus the response of treated nom samples need to compare with the control group to be considered positive therefore a sample was considered genotoxic only when significant difference of induction coefficients between the treated sample and the corresponding control group was observed phosphate buffer with nitrate but without noms before and after uv treatments was firstly analyzed and the results showed no significant difference from the control group consequently excluding the possible genotoxicity from the change of nitrate and h2o2 themselves a one way analysis of variance anova was then performed on the induction coefficients of the experimental group uv0 uv800 hp0 and hp800 and the control group in fig 7 a and no difference was observed in samples without no3 p 0 05 while significant difference was observed in the no3 spiked samples p 0 01 further comparison showed that the induction coefficients of samples uv0 and uv800 with nitrate were significantly lower than the control group the reason of which may be that nom and no3 formed substances that promote fluorescence quenching such as fluorescence quencher nitro diazo carboxyl and carbonyl compounds the paired t test was performed on the samples without no3 and with no3 and the induction coefficients did not show a significant difference caused by no3 no significantly positive response was observed among all the samples in the p53 assay without metabolic activation as shown in fig 7 a in fig 7 b the induction coefficient of each sample in the p53 s9 assay showed a large difference the mean values of the induction coefficients of uv800 hp0 and hp800 in the samples with no3 were 2 4 2 0 and 2 5 respectively which were significantly higher than in the control group p 0 05 indicating that 800 mj cm2 of uv fluence can induce genotoxicity under metabolic activation during both mp uv and mp uv h2o2 treatments h2o2 itself also had a certain inducing effect although much lower than that of uv irradiation paired t test on the induction coefficients of samples uv800 hp0 and hp800 all showed significant difference between with no3 and without no3 scenarios in the p53 s9 assay with a p value of 0 019 0 022 0 002 respectively suggesting the critical role of nitrate on the observed genotoxicity it is noteworthy that the concentration of nom 1 5 mg c l used in this study fits in the realistic drinking water source scenario kolkman et al 2015 and the nitrate spiked 2 3 mg n l is even less than the drinking water criterion 10 mg n l regulated by many countries and regions world health organization 2018 it means that genotoxicity might be caused right now in the drinking water facilities using mp uv and mp uv h2o2 processes which is worthy of further evaluation no3 caused no genotoxicity effect when uv and h2o2 were neither applied though non negligible effect was observed on the molecule composition fig 3 4 conclusion a simulation experiment of nom degradation under mp uv and mp uv h2o2 treatments were conducted and the effect of nitrate on the composition variations of nom on the characteristics of nitrate derived n dbps and on the induction of genotoxicity was investigated nitrate can accelerate the degradation of nom in the mp uv process by providing more free radicals but can interfere with h2o2 and thereby inhibit the degradation of nom in the mp uv h2o2 process nitrate affects the decomposition of nom in various aspects including o atom distributions molecule analogs and double bond equivalents nno3 can be incorporated into noms to form n dbps and most of these n dbps contain one nitrogen atom the representative features of which are a nitro group a methoxy group or a phenolic hydroxyl group and an ester group on the benzene ring under continuous oxidation the methoxy and ester groups are attacked by oh and can be evolved into phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups nitrate spiked under realistic environmental concentration can play a critical role on the genotoxicity formation during the mp uv treatments of nom and the genotoxicity in the drinking water facilities using uv processes need to be evaluated the findings in this study have significance for drinking water safety management by suggesting that nitrate played a critical role in triggering genotoxicity and producing n dbps during uv based water treatments additional processes e g post gac might be essential to be performed after mp uv to remove the induced genotoxicity as suggested by heringa et al 2011

16637,as iii species are the predominant form of arsenic found in groundwater however nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro membranes are often unable to effectively reject as iii in this study we fabricate highly conducting ultrafiltration uf membranes for effective as iii rejection these membranes consist of a hydrophilic nickel carbon nanotubes layer deposited on a uf support and used as cathodes applying cathodic potentials significantly increased as iii rejection in synthetic real tap water a result of locally elevated ph that is brought upon through water electrolysis at the membrane water interface the elevated ph conditions convert h3aso3 to h2aso3 haso3 2 that are rejected by the negatively charged membranes in addition it was found that mg oh 2 that precipitates on the membrane can further trap arsenic importantly almost all as iii passing through the membranes is oxidized to as v by hydrogen peroxide produced on the cathode which significantly decreased its overall toxicity and mobility although the high ph along the membrane surface led to mineral scaling this scale could be partially removed by backwashing the membrane to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of effective as iii removal using low pressure membranes with as iii rejection higher than that achieved by nf and ro and high water permeance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keyword arsenite removal ultrafiltration membranes electrically conductive membranes groundwater 1 introduction both chronic and acute exposure to arsenic can be highly hazardous jang et al 2016 elevated concentration i e 10 μg l of arsenic in groundwater have been reported in many countries including the usa india japan germany and china with over extraction of groundwater brought about by water shortages increasing the risk of arsenic exposure ayotte et al 2017 singh et al 2015 smith et al 2018 arsenic occurs in various oxidation states including arsine as3 elemental arsenic as0 arsenite as iii and arsenate as v singh et al 2015 and the toxicity of arsenic varies with arsenic speciation as iii is the most toxic species and is thermodynamically favorable in reduced redox environment singh et al 2015 as v is the less toxic species and is the predominant species in oxygenated environments jang et al 2016 it is noted that both as iii and as v may occur simultaneously in groundwater due to their slow redox kinetics singh et al 2015 various engineering methods have been employed to remove arsenic from drinking water because as iii is more mobile and harder to treat the oxidation of as iii to as v is often used to achieve arsenic removal targets when as iii is the predominant arsenic species singh et al 2015 oxidation techniques able to convert as iii to as v including chemical oxidation dodd et al 2006 photo oxidation ryu et al 2013 bio oxidation saalfield and bostick 2009 and electrochemical oxidation kim et al 2014 have been widely investigated however these oxidative methods require additional solid liquid separation steps such as sand filtration leupin and hug 2005 and coagulation sedimentation lee et al 2003 flocculation and coagulation are the most widely employed techniques in drinking water plants to directly remove arsenic the effectiveness of which depends on the types of coagulant arsenic species and various operational conditions e g ph singh et al 2015 it is noted that flocculation and in particular aluminum hydroxide based flocculation couldn t effectively remove as iii hering et al 1997 and as iii removal by ferric chloride is less efficient compared to as v hering et al 1997 lee et al 2003 also flocculation and coagulation produce large volumes of waste sludge with elevated concentrations of arsenic more importantly it is impractical for those who get drinking water from private wells to use a coagulation based system sorption based treatment of arsenic is sometimes used by small scale or point of use pou treatment systems jang et al 2008 however the effectiveness of sorption is dependent on the solution ph jang et al 2008 manna et al 2003 and phosphate concentrations chowdhury and yanful 2010 and as iii removal is generally not as good as as v in the neutral ph range singh et al 2015 which limits this approach s utility many owners of private wells and indeed many households in general utilize membrane units to ensure the safety of their drinking water george et al 2006 nanofiltration nf membranes are able to reject up to 99 of as v but only achieve 5 to 33 removal of as iii epa 2000 seidel et al 2001 yoon et al 2009 it has been reported that ro systems can remove between 5 84 of as iii in groundwater akin et al 2011 ning 2002 but many household ro systems in the usa remove less than 50 of arsenic when as iii is the dominant arsenic species walker et al 2008 importantly a study that collected samples from 65 wells across the usa found that as iii is the dominant 90 arsenic species in approximately 45 of these wells and as iii contributed to more than 50 of the total arsenic in more than 50 of these wells sorg et al 2014 indicating that a large number of people who get drinking water from wells may experience exposure to arsenic contamination the challenge in removing as iii with tight membranes is due to a fact that as iii mainly presents as h3aso3 as the pka of h3aso3 is 9 23 in natural waters a neutral and highly mobile molecule nf and ro membranes both rely on charge and size to effectively remove small molecules with both offering relatively poor rejection of small uncharged species such as h3aso3 electrically conducting membranes ecms are versatile membranes that are able to induce electrochemical reactions directly at the membrane water interface zhu and jassby 2019 these electrochemical reactions can enhance the rejection of pollutants by modifying the local ph along the membrane surfaces through water electrolysis jung et al 2020 as well as triggering redox transformations of contaminants duan et al 2017 le et al 2019 ecms can be fabricated with organic and inorganic substances e g conductive polymers carbon nanotubes cnts and metal or metal oxides almassi et al 2018 ronen et al 2016 cnt based ecms have been fabricated using pressure deposition duan et al 2016 or spray coating approaches dudchenko et al 2017 tang et al 2017 in addition previous work has demonstrated that ecms are capable of resisting multiple forms of fouling including biofouling ronen et al 2015 organic fouling dudchenko et al 2014 and mineral scaling duan et al 2014 recently nickel coated cnt ni cnt based ecms were employed to catalyze water splitting and enhance the local ph near the membrane surface hou et al 2018 iddya et al 2020 in this study we fabricated highly electrically conducting uf membranes for effective as iii rejection these uf membranes consisted of a hydrophilic ni cnt layer deposited on a hydrophilic polysulfone support we demonstrate that the application of cathodic potentials to the membrane surface drives the hydrogen evolution reaction her catalyzed by the ni coating that leads to a local ph increase shifts h3aso3 to its ionic form and enables electrostatic repulsion of this species by the membrane as iii species that do pass through the membrane are transformed to as v species through electrochemically generated h2o2 a result of oxygen reduction on the membrane cathode which reduces the mobility and toxicity of any arsenic that is not rejected mg ca hydroxides and or carbonates precipitated on the membrane surface a result of the locally elevated ph conditions but membrane performance could be restored with a backwashing step to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to report high as iii rejection with porous membranes having high water permeance without using oxidative pre treatment 2 materials methods 2 1 chemicals and instruments sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate ddbs technical

2 2 membrane preparation and characterization uf membranes coated with a 6 µm thick cnt layer were fabricated via a pressure deposition method the details of which were described previously dudchenko

membranes used in this study were initially compressed at 100 psi i e 689 kpa with a diaphragm pump hydra cell mn for at least 12 h before use a gear pump cole parmer il usa with a flow rate of 11 3 0 8 ml s corresponding to a cross flow velocity of 7 0 0 5 cm s was used to conduct the filtration experiments in membrane performance tests real tap water was used while synthetic tap water was used when investigating the mechanistic aspects of the observed phenomena arsenic concentrations in groundwater vary greatly from one location to another with a concentration ranging from 0 5 to 5000 µg l singh et al 2015 in our experiments 750 µg l as iii were spiked into both real tap water and synthetic water solution this concentration has been previously used in other studies investigating the removal of as iii from water akin et al 2011 due to differences in membrane permeance between the cnt and ni cnt membranes to achieve comparable fluxes in these membranes 0 9 0 1 psi i e 6 2 0 7 kpa

supply model ka3005p korad brand shenzhen china a peristaltic pump model rf100 greylor fl usa was used for membrane backwashing at a pressure of 8 psi i e 55 1 kpa in scaling experiments the system was run for 100 min with 7 v cell potential applied membrane as cathode followed by a 5 minute crossflow flushing and a 5 minute backwashing with di water all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 4 potential profile on the membrane surface it was reported that the overall resistance of a cnt thin film has a linear relationship with its length blighe et al 2007 therefore a linear potential profile on the membrane surface can be calculated using the current and resistance of the membrane electrode soaked in water the current was measured with a multimeter the resistance of the membrane soaked in solution was calculated using an equivalent circuit model where the membrane and solution are recognized as resistors in parallel zhu and jassby 2019 with this model the total resistance was calculated using kirchhoff s law 1 r t o t a l 1 r m e m b r a n e 1 r s o l u t i o n where rtotal rmembrane and rsolution represent the total system resistance membrane resistance and solution resistance respectively because the solutions used in this work real and synthetic tap water had a significantly lower conductivity 0 04 s m than the cnt membranes 2280 s m let alone ni cnt membranes 29 976 s m it is reasonable to assume that r t o t a l is close to r m e m b r a n e i e 1 r s o l u t i o n is ignored in equation resistance the potential drop on the membrane was calculated with ohm s law v i r t o t a l where v is voltage drop v and i is the current a 2 5 models to predict ph on the membrane surface the ph on the membrane surface was simulated with comsol multiphysics using adaptive time stepping equilateral triangle mesh elements mesh opening of 173 21 µm2 and periodic boundary conditions the membrane was modeled as a planar electrode that generates oh ions through the water electrolysis reaction 2 h 2 o 2 e 2 o h h 2 the oh generation rate was calculated from the cell current using faraday s equation j o h i z f where joh is the flux of oh z is the charge of oh i is the current and f is faraday s constant we assumed the distribution of oh is only governed by fick s first and second laws j o h d o h c o h c o h t d o h 2 c o h where doh is the diffusion coefficient of oh taken as 5 27e 5 cm2 s haynes 2014 and coh is the concentration of oh consequently the ph at the membrane surface can be calculated as the function of time see figure s2 note that for laminar flow conditions the crossflow rate adjacent to the membrane surface is small leal 1992 and therefore oh transport through convection was not considered in addition due to the large potential drop bard and faulkner 2001 at the membrane solution interface i e owning to the formation of the electrical double layer edl ion migration was not considered for simplicity it is noted that oxygen reduction is occurring along the membrane however both oxygen reduction reactions equations s1 and s2 will not impact the faradaic efficiency used to simulate the ph because the products of these oxygen reduction reactions are still oh 2 6 mineral speciation under different ph and cation concentrations geochemists workbench student 14 0 was used to calculate magnesium species distribution versus ph and calcium concentrations an open carbonate system was assumed 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterization the electro deposition of nickel imbued the black cnt uf membranes with a metallic sheen figure s1 the contact angle of a plain ps 35 membrane was reported as 49 2 0 9 in our previous study dudchenko et al 2014 while the deposition of cnts increased the contact angle to 113 7 6 0 fig 1 a due to the hydrophobicity of cnts dudchenko et al 2014 however the electro deposition of nickel decreased the contact angle to 68 2 1 6 fig 1b which corresponds well with previous reports iddya et al 2020 the cnts formed a porous network with pores ranging in diameter between 10 and 100 nm dudchenko et al 2014 and our previous research suggests that it is the ps 35 uf support rather than the cnt network that governs the composite material s rejection dudchenko et al 2014 which has a mean pore size of 17 nm aher et al 2017 the ni cnt network has a mean pore size of 11 nm measured from the sem micrograph fig 1b however nickel didn t form a dense film and as a result the cnt network was still visible after the electro deposition step fig 1b although nickel reduced the membrane s water permeance from 8 l m2 h psi i e 1 2 l m2 h kpa to 2 l m2 h psi i e 0 3 l m2 h kpa nickel deposition dramatically decreased the electrical resistivity of the membranes from 73 1 7 1 ohms square to 5 6 5 5 ohms square this decreased electrical resistance causes a significantly reduced potential drop across the membrane compared to cnt uf membranes fig 1d which was calculated based on current density measurements acquired during the real tap water test section 3 2 the detailed discussions are described in si we note that the potential drop differences between ni cnt uf and cnt uf membranes increased with increasing potential fig 1d due to the larger current densities at higher potentials in addition the lower resistance of ni cnt uf membranes compared to cnt uf membranes resulted in a higher current density as measured by lsv in tap water fig 1e cv curves revealed that ni cnt uf membranes experienced a lower water electrolysis onset potential and higher currents compared to the cnt uf membranes likely because of the catalytic properties of the deposited nickel towards the her fig 1f hou et al 2018 3 2 as iii removal performance and mechanism to test as iii removal by cnt uf and ni cnt uf membranes in real water samples 750 µg l of as iii sodium meta arsenite was spiked into los angeles tap water it is noted that tap water in los angeles is a blend composed of groundwater and surface water in addition our tap water has bicarbonate concentrations shown in table 1 that fall within the range associated with groundwater saha et al 2019 therefore it is reasonable to use this tap to represent ground water to investigate the removal mechanisms as iii removal and arsenic speciation i e as v and as iii were evaluated in different synthetic salt solutions e g na2so4 nacl and a mixture of na2so4 mgso4 and caso4 that had similar conductivity 404 9 3 6 μs cm to real tap water 358 0 0 9 μs cm in tap water tests experiments were run for 2 h before samples were collected at ocp to investigate as iii removal of the uncharged membranes then 3 5 and 7 v cell potentials membrane as cathode were sequentially applied with each potential being applied for 30 min under ocp conditions as iii removal by the cnt uf membrane was 8 9 1 7 fig 2 a suggesting that sorption could remove a limited amount of as iii this corresponds with previous cnt adsorption studies which showed that cnts have a limited adsorption capacity towards as iii i e 13 5 µg g ali 2018 negative potentials applied to the cnt uf membranes significantly increased as iii rejection with rejection increasing with an increase of the applied potential fig 2a with a low operating pressure i e 0 9 0 1 psi i e 6 2 kpa 0 7 kpa 8 9 1 0 l m2 h cnt uf membranes achieved as iii removal as high as 72 6 5 1 when 7 v was applied lower potentials yielded lower rejection fig 2a but these rejection values were still significantly higher than as iii rejection reported for by the majority of high pressure nf or ro membranes fig 2b and table 3 the flux of the cnt uf membranes slightly increased with an increase in potential i e when the applied cell potential was 5 v in fig 2c likely because the applied potential increased the local ph which further deprotonated carboxyl groups on the cnts and made the membrane more hydrophilic over time higher potentials led to flux decline 93 4 10 3 of original flux due to scaling caused by the high local ph it is noted that the ph of the feed is supposed to be constant because all the permeate was returned to the feed however the feed ph slightly dropped from 7 69 to 7 23 over the course of the experiment likely due to the precipitation of mg oh 2 on the membrane surface ni cnt uf membranes further enhanced as iii rejection in tap water to 93 3 3 9 when a cell potential of 7 v was applied with a flux of 9 1 0 4 l m2 h operating pressure 4 1 2 9 psi i e 28 2 20 0 kpa fig 2a which is close to the minimum removal i e 98 7 for 750 µg l as iii needed to achieve the mcl 10 µg l as set by the epa it is worth noting that we tested our membranes under highly challenging conditions i e 90 of total arsenic was in as iii form these conditions only occur in 29 of 65 wells investigated across the usa sorg et al 2014 while as v is the predominant arsenic species in 31 of 65 wells sorg et al 2014 considering that as v is much easier to be removed than as iii by membranes singh et al 2015 that as concentrations ranged between 19 89 µg l in the us well water survey and that we could remove 93 3 3 9 of as iii it is reasonable to expect that the mcl could be achieved by our membranes in most of cases sorg et al 2014 the flux through the ni cnt uf membrane declined with increasing cathodic potentials fig 2c this is likely a result of mineral scaling that forms on the membrane surface a result of the locally elevated ph conditions the low as iii rejection achieved by conventional uf nf ro membrane processes is due to the uncharged form of as iii h3aso3 in most natural systems the first pka of h3aso3 is 9 23 sadiq et al 1983 ma et al 2020 however the application of cathodic potentials increases the local ph on the cnt uf and ni cnt uf membrane surface as evident by the elevated ph of the permeate ph of 10 9 0 1 and 11 8 0 1 for the cnt uf and ni cnt uf respectively this ph is higher than the first pka of as iii i e 9 23 converting h3aso3 to its charged form h2aso3 this ionic form of as iii i e h2aso3 is rejected by the negatively charged membranes due to powerful electrostatic repulsive forces induced by the applied potential dudchenko et al 2014 importantly the ph at the membrane water interface is likely higher than these values but is impossible to be measured directly based on our simulations section 2 5 the ph at the membrane surface was close to 13 figure s2 this ph is near above the second pka of h3aso3 i e 12 13 potentially leading to the formation of haso3 2 whose increased negative charge would enable even more efficient electrostatic repulsion and higher rejection in addition to transforming as iii to its charged form the elevated ph conditions along the membrane surface led to the precipitation of metal hydroxides and carbonates e g mg oh 2 caco3 evident by the flux decline at higher applied potentials fig 2c which was particularly apparent when the ni cnt uf membranes were tested however metal hydroxides can play an important role in arsenic removal fig 2d shows as iii rejection by cnt uf membranes under different synthetic salt solutions having similar conductivity to tap water the presence of mg and ca in the feed significantly enhanced the rejection of as iii fig 2d we speculate that this is because precipitates formed by mg ca e g caco3 and or mg oh 2 can adsorb as iii the geochemist workbench software package predicted that mg oh 2 was the dominant mineral formed on the surface of the membrane i e when ph was over 10 5 and the concentrations of mg2 and ca2 were 10 ppm and 50 ppm respectively fig 2e therefore we hypothesize that mg oh 2 is the main species responsible for arsenic adsorption previous studies have reported that mg oh 2 is an effective sorbent for both as v and as iii at high ph i e ph 11 mcneill and edwards 1997 a previous study has also shown that nanostructured mgo has a high removal capacity for arsenic liu et al 2011 edx analysis of a scaled membrane surface confirmed that the accumulated scale was primarily composed of mg containing minerals figure s3b d it is possible that competing ions e g phosphate could influence the adsorption of arsenic pincus et al 2020 however the concentration of phosphate was low in the tap water table 1 in addition as iii rejection in the presence of nacl was slightly lower than that in the presence of na2so4 fig 2d which is possibly because reactive chlorine species rcs formed on the anode compete with the water reduction reaction on the cathode kim et al 2014 which led to a lower ph along the membrane that reduced as iii ion formation the conversion of as iii to as v is desirable because as v is less toxic and mobile than as iii sharma and sohn 2009 as iii may be directly oxidized on the anode or oxidized by rcs or other oxidizing agents formed on the anode or cathode kim et al 2014 in the presence of chloride ions i e in the nacl solution as v concentrations in the feed increased from 18 4 to 30 3 from 30 min to 1 h fig 2f while as v levels only increased slightly from 14 1 to 17 3 when the feed was na2so4 fig 2f this indicates that direct oxidation of as iii by the platinum coated titanium anode was slow and rcs produced from chloride oxidation were largely responsible for the oxidation of as iii in the bulk feed kim et al 2014 interestingly nearly 100 of arsenic in both na2so4 and nacl feed solutions was oxidized to as v in the permeate fig 2f indicating that as iii was primarily oxidized to as v as it passed through the cathodic membrane rather than at the anode or in the bulk feed e g by rcs this is counter intuitive as reduction reactions are typical on the cathodic membranes we speculate that hydrogen peroxide produced through the electroreduction of oxygen was responsible for the oxidation of as iii to as v qian et al 2015 we measured approximately 50 µg l h2o2 in the permeate oxygen the precursor of hydrogen peroxide could come from the air or the anode where water splitting reactions produce oxygen and oxygen can diffuse to the cathode kim et al 2014 oxidation of as iii by electrochemically generated h2o2 on a cathode was first observed and studied by qian et al in 2015 who noted that high ph the presence of humic acid hco3 ca2 and mg2 could enhance the oxidation process qian et al 2015 since these conditions are commonly found in drinking water sources this mechanism can explain the conversion of as iii to as v as the compounds move through the membrane cathode unfortunately it is impossible to rule out the possibility that oxidization of as iii to as v occurs during preparation of icp ms samples i e stabilizing samples with 5 nitric acid the presence of oxygen is inevitable because the oxygen evolution reaction occurs on the anode and this gas may diffuse to the cathode therefore experiments in zero oxygen conditions are difficult to accomplish also our results indicated that as v wasn t reduced to as iii by our cathodic membranes likely because of as v s electrochemical inactivity huiliang et al 1988 it is noted that nickel layer on the top of cnts is a mixture of ni 0 and ni oh 2 hou et al 2018 ni oh 2 is reported to be stable in the presence of h2o2 yan et al 2012 and ni 0 is also highly resistant to h2o2 in neutral or alkaline conditions wilbraham et al 2018 importantly there is a highly reductive and alkaline environment around the ni cnt uf membranes as we are applying cathodic potentials suggesting that the leaching of ni2 is highly unlikely also a recent study found that little ni dissolved at ph 12 after 50 h operating with a ni activated carbon cathode kim et al 2018 therefore it is reasonable to conclude that ni cnt uf membranes are resistant to trace h2o2 formed in the cathode 3 3 scaling and cleaning while electroactive membranes have been demonstrated to be able to prevent multiple forms of fouling including biofouling ronen et al 2015 and organic fouling dudchenko et al 2014 the application of high cathodic potentials such as were used here to achieve good rejection inevitably lead to the formation of mineral scaling by mg oh 2 and caco3 on the membrane surface fig 3 sequential testing of a ni cnt uf membrane to remove as iii from tap water showed a 36 15 decline in flux after 300 min fig 3a a 5 minute backwash and a 5 minute crossflow with di water could recover the membrane flux for three sequential cycles fig 3a however the flux decline in each of these sequential cycles was more rapid than the first round with flux declining by approximately 46 3 average decline of 2nd 3rd and 4th run within 100 min indicating that the cleaning process led to incomplete scale removal more rigorous chemical cleaning e g a periodic weak acid rinse under cathodic protection pierozynski et al 2009 would likely be needed to completely recover the membrane surface it is critical to note that the backwash water is toxic as it contains arsenic adsorbed by magnesium hydroxide it has been reported that such materials arsenic sorbed onto mg oh 2 can be used as additives in cement manufacturing where they can be safely sequestered in concrete products tresintsi et al 2014 3 4 economic analysis the treatment costs of arsenic in drinking water are highly dependent on the dominant as species and the technology used and span a very wide range between near zero e g laterite absorption to as high as 70 m3 shan et al 2019 several highly affordable engineering methods e g coagulation and flocculation are available to effectively remove as v under normal drinking water conditions however there are few options to cheaply remove as iii directly i e without pre oxidization steps particularly using point of use applications for example even household ro considered by many as the gold standard of point of use systems can only achieve 50 as iii removal walker et al 2008 with other treatment technologies such as nf achieving even lower removal in contrast our electroactive uf membranes are highly effective at removing as iii as a result it is not straight forward to compare the treatment costs of water dominated by as iii contamination in our treatment system the additional cost of electricity plays an important role in the overall operating cost of the process with increasing energy associated with higher voltages these higher voltages also enable higher rejection of as iii fig 2a in other words the energy required to achieve acceptable permeate as iii concentrations i e 10 µg l increases linearly with increasing as iii concentrations in the feed stream fig 4 in this figure the required energy to reduce the permeate concentration to below 10 µg l was calculated based on the experimental data presented in fig 2a to account for the average lower flux caused by the membrane fouling we assumed that the average flux is 60 of the initial flux which is the average flux during the 4 experimental runs in addition based on a recent epa study contaminated well water in the usa contains anywhere between 0 3 68 µg l as iii sorg et al 2014 based on these initial concentrations and an average flux i e 60 of the initial flux the energy required to treat this water ranges between 1 94 kwh m3 for the case where the initial concentration is just above the maximum allowable limit 11 µg l to 12 00 kwh m3 if the as iii concentration is 68 µg l based on the average cost of household electricity in the usa 0 167 kwh for the usa west coast the additional electrical costs range between 0 32 m3 and 2 00 m3 in addition this cost is highly sensitive to flux duan et al 2017 e g the additional electrical costs could drop to between 0 09 m3 i e 0 57 kwh m3 and 0 59 m3 i e 3 56 kwh m3 if the initial flux increased to 27 l m2 h which is a reasonable flux for a uf process few studies report the total cost i e the sum of capita and operating costs of a household uf system a single study reports that the total cost of a household uf treatment system is approximately 0 10 m3 of product water praneeth et al 2014 but the system contains a hand pump and is not particularly relevant when pressurized water lines are available as is the case in the vast majority of the developed world it is reported that the cost of household ro system is as high as 3 4 m3 of product water wang et al 2011 while the cost of industrial scale ro treated water ranges from 0 38 to 0 52 m3 of produced water jung et al 2020 if we assume that the cost of household uf scales similarly to household ro the ratio of household ro cost to industrial ro costs 3 4 m3 to 0 45 m3 we can estimate the cost of a household uf system from the cost of an industrial uf drinking water treatment plant i e 0 28 m3 duan et al 2017 therefore the total cost of a household uf system is estimated at 2 1 m3 considering an additional energy related operating cost of 0 35 m3 i e 2 07 kwh m3 calculated assuming an initial as iii concentration of 39 50 µg l i e the mid point between 11 µg l and 68 µg l and additional material cost i e from the addition of cnts and nickel of approximately 0 03 m3 assumes membrane could be used for 1 year see detailed calculations in the si the total cost i e operating and capital cost of using household ni cnt uf membranes to treat arsenic contaminated water is 2 48 m3 it is noted that the majority of this cost is from the capital costs of a household uf membrane system this cost will be significantly lower for industrial uf systems while this number is speculative it does provide a framework for the solution of as iii removal at the household level it is critical to note that the solution proposed here is to the best of our knowledge the only technological solution capable of removing as iii at a household level without pre oxidizing as iii the oxidation of as iii to as v needed to enable other treatment technologies adds another layer of complexity and cost to the process 4 conclusion this study demonstrates an effective membrane based low pressure as iii removal technology oh ions produced locally on the membrane surface transform neutral h3aso3 to its ionic forms h2aso3 haso3 2 that are effectively rejected by negatively charged ni cnt uf or cnt uf membranes in addition mg oh 2 precipitates on the membrane surface further adsorb as iii which increases removal importantly nearly all as iii passing through the membrane is oxidized to as v transformed by hydrogen peroxide produced on the cathodic membranes which decreases arsenic s mobility and toxicity mineral scaling formed on the membrane could be partially removed by physical cleaning backwash and cross flushing but more rigorous chemical cleaning e g an acid rinse would likely be needed periodically to

16637,as iii species are the predominant form of arsenic found in groundwater however nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro membranes are often unable to effectively reject as iii in this study we fabricate highly conducting ultrafiltration uf membranes for effective as iii rejection these membranes consist of a hydrophilic nickel carbon nanotubes layer deposited on a uf support and used as cathodes applying cathodic potentials significantly increased as iii rejection in synthetic real tap water a result of locally elevated ph that is brought upon through water electrolysis at the membrane water interface the elevated ph conditions convert h3aso3 to h2aso3 haso3 2 that are rejected by the negatively charged membranes in addition it was found that mg oh 2 that precipitates on the membrane can further trap arsenic importantly almost all as iii passing through the membranes is oxidized to as v by hydrogen peroxide produced on the cathode which significantly decreased its overall toxicity and mobility although the high ph along the membrane surface led to mineral scaling this scale could be partially removed by backwashing the membrane to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of effective as iii removal using low pressure membranes with as iii rejection higher than that achieved by nf and ro and high water permeance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keyword arsenite removal ultrafiltration membranes electrically conductive membranes groundwater 1 introduction both chronic and acute exposure to arsenic can be highly hazardous jang et al 2016 elevated concentration i e 10 μg l of arsenic in groundwater have been reported in many countries including the usa india japan germany and china with over extraction of groundwater brought about by water shortages increasing the risk of arsenic exposure ayotte et al 2017 singh et al 2015 smith et al 2018 arsenic occurs in various oxidation states including arsine as3 elemental arsenic as0 arsenite as iii and arsenate as v singh et al 2015 and the toxicity of arsenic varies with arsenic speciation as iii is the most toxic species and is thermodynamically favorable in reduced redox environment singh et al 2015 as v is the less toxic species and is the predominant species in oxygenated environments jang et al 2016 it is noted that both as iii and as v may occur simultaneously in groundwater due to their slow redox kinetics singh et al 2015 various engineering methods have been employed to remove arsenic from drinking water because as iii is more mobile and harder to treat the oxidation of as iii to as v is often used to achieve arsenic removal targets when as iii is the predominant arsenic species singh et al 2015 oxidation techniques able to convert as iii to as v including chemical oxidation dodd et al 2006 photo oxidation ryu et al 2013 bio oxidation saalfield and bostick 2009 and electrochemical oxidation kim et al 2014 have been widely investigated however these oxidative methods require additional solid liquid separation steps such as sand filtration leupin and hug 2005 and coagulation sedimentation lee et al 2003 flocculation and coagulation are the most widely employed techniques in drinking water plants to directly remove arsenic the effectiveness of which depends on the types of coagulant arsenic species and various operational conditions e g ph singh et al 2015 it is noted that flocculation and in particular aluminum hydroxide based flocculation couldn t effectively remove as iii hering et al 1997 and as iii removal by ferric chloride is less efficient compared to as v hering et al 1997 lee et al 2003 also flocculation and coagulation produce large volumes of waste sludge with elevated concentrations of arsenic more importantly it is impractical for those who get drinking water from private wells to use a coagulation based system sorption based treatment of arsenic is sometimes used by small scale or point of use pou treatment systems jang et al 2008 however the effectiveness of sorption is dependent on the solution ph jang et al 2008 manna et al 2003 and phosphate concentrations chowdhury and yanful 2010 and as iii removal is generally not as good as as v in the neutral ph range singh et al 2015 which limits this approach s utility many owners of private wells and indeed many households in general utilize membrane units to ensure the safety of their drinking water george et al 2006 nanofiltration nf membranes are able to reject up to 99 of as v but only achieve 5 to 33 removal of as iii epa 2000 seidel et al 2001 yoon et al 2009 it has been reported that ro systems can remove between 5 84 of as iii in groundwater akin et al 2011 ning 2002 but many household ro systems in the usa remove less than 50 of arsenic when as iii is the dominant arsenic species walker et al 2008 importantly a study that collected samples from 65 wells across the usa found that as iii is the dominant 90 arsenic species in approximately 45 of these wells and as iii contributed to more than 50 of the total arsenic in more than 50 of these wells sorg et al 2014 indicating that a large number of people who get drinking water from wells may experience exposure to arsenic contamination the challenge in removing as iii with tight membranes is due to a fact that as iii mainly presents as h3aso3 as the pka of h3aso3 is 9 23 in natural waters a neutral and highly mobile molecule nf and ro membranes both rely on charge and size to effectively remove small molecules with both offering relatively poor rejection of small uncharged species such as h3aso3 electrically conducting membranes ecms are versatile membranes that are able to induce electrochemical reactions directly at the membrane water interface zhu and jassby 2019 these electrochemical reactions can enhance the rejection of pollutants by modifying the local ph along the membrane surfaces through water electrolysis jung et al 2020 as well as triggering redox transformations of contaminants duan et al 2017 le et al 2019 ecms can be fabricated with organic and inorganic substances e g conductive polymers carbon nanotubes cnts and metal or metal oxides almassi et al 2018 ronen et al 2016 cnt based ecms have been fabricated using pressure deposition duan et al 2016 or spray coating approaches dudchenko et al 2017 tang et al 2017 in addition previous work has demonstrated that ecms are capable of resisting multiple forms of fouling including biofouling ronen et al 2015 organic fouling dudchenko et al 2014 and mineral scaling duan et al 2014 recently nickel coated cnt ni cnt based ecms were employed to catalyze water splitting and enhance the local ph near the membrane surface hou et al 2018 iddya et al 2020 in this study we fabricated highly electrically conducting uf membranes for effective as iii rejection these uf membranes consisted of a hydrophilic ni cnt layer deposited on a hydrophilic polysulfone support we demonstrate that the application of cathodic potentials to the membrane surface drives the hydrogen evolution reaction her catalyzed by the ni coating that leads to a local ph increase shifts h3aso3 to its ionic form and enables electrostatic repulsion of this species by the membrane as iii species that do pass through the membrane are transformed to as v species through electrochemically generated h2o2 a result of oxygen reduction on the membrane cathode which reduces the mobility and toxicity of any arsenic that is not rejected mg ca hydroxides and or carbonates precipitated on the membrane surface a result of the locally elevated ph conditions but membrane performance could be restored with a backwashing step to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to report high

singh et al 2015 in our experiments 750 µg l as iii were spiked into both real tap water and synthetic water solution this concentration has been previously used in other studies investigating the

resistance respectively because the solutions used in this work real and synthetic tap water had a significantly lower conductivity 0 04 s m than the cnt membranes 2280 s m let alone ni cnt membranes 29 976 s m it is reasonable to assume that r t o t a l is close to r m e m b r a n e i e 1 r s o l u t i o n is ignored in equation resistance the potential drop on the membrane was calculated with ohm s law v i r t o t a l where v is voltage drop v and i is the current a 2 5 models to predict ph on the membrane surface the ph on the membrane surface was simulated with comsol multiphysics using adaptive time stepping equilateral triangle mesh elements mesh opening of 173 21 µm2 and periodic boundary conditions the membrane was modeled as a planar electrode that generates oh ions through the water electrolysis reaction 2 h 2 o 2 e 2 o h h 2 the oh generation rate was calculated from the cell current using faraday s equation j o h i z f where joh is the flux of oh z is the charge of oh i is the current and f is faraday s constant we assumed the distribution of oh is only governed by fick s first and second laws j o h d o h c o h c o h t d o h 2 c o h where doh is the diffusion coefficient of oh taken as 5 27e 5 cm2 s haynes 2014 and coh is the concentration of oh consequently the ph at the membrane surface can be calculated as the function of time see figure s2 note that for laminar flow conditions the crossflow rate adjacent to the membrane surface is small leal 1992 and therefore oh transport through convection was not considered in addition due to the large potential drop bard and faulkner 2001 at the membrane solution interface i e owning to the formation of the electrical double layer edl ion migration was not considered for simplicity it is noted that oxygen reduction is occurring along the membrane however both oxygen reduction reactions equations s1 and s2 will not impact the faradaic efficiency used to simulate the ph because the products of these oxygen reduction reactions are still oh 2 6 mineral speciation under different ph and cation concentrations geochemists workbench student 14 0 was used to calculate magnesium species distribution versus ph and calcium concentrations an open carbonate system was assumed 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterization the electro deposition of nickel imbued the black cnt uf membranes with a metallic sheen figure s1 the contact angle of a plain ps 35 membrane was reported as 49 2 0 9 in our previous study dudchenko et al 2014 while the deposition of cnts increased the contact angle to 113 7 6 0 fig 1 a due to the hydrophobicity of cnts dudchenko et al 2014 however the electro deposition of nickel decreased the contact angle to 68 2 1 6 fig 1b which corresponds well with previous reports iddya et al 2020 the cnts formed a porous network with pores ranging in diameter between 10 and 100 nm dudchenko et al 2014 and our previous research suggests that it is the ps 35 uf support rather than the cnt network that governs the composite material s rejection dudchenko et al 2014 which has a mean pore size of 17 nm aher et al 2017 the ni cnt network has a mean pore size of 11 nm measured from the sem micrograph fig 1b however nickel didn t form a dense film and as a result the cnt network was still visible after the electro deposition step fig 1b although nickel reduced the membrane s water permeance from 8 l m2 h psi i e 1 2 l m2 h kpa to 2 l m2 h psi i e 0 3 l m2 h kpa nickel deposition dramatically decreased the electrical resistivity of the membranes from 73 1 7 1 ohms square to 5 6 5 5 ohms square this decreased electrical resistance causes a significantly reduced potential drop across the membrane compared to cnt uf membranes fig 1d which was calculated based on current density measurements acquired during the real tap water test section 3 2 the detailed discussions are described in si we note that the potential drop differences between ni cnt uf and cnt uf membranes increased with increasing potential fig 1d due to the larger current densities at higher potentials in addition the lower resistance of ni cnt uf membranes compared to cnt uf membranes resulted in a higher current density as measured by lsv in tap water fig 1e cv curves revealed that ni cnt uf membranes experienced a lower water electrolysis onset potential and higher currents compared to the cnt uf membranes likely because of the catalytic properties of the deposited nickel towards the her fig 1f hou et al 2018 3 2 as iii removal performance and mechanism to test as iii removal by cnt uf and ni cnt uf membranes in real water samples 750 µg l of as iii sodium meta arsenite was spiked into los angeles tap water it is noted that tap water in los angeles is a blend composed of groundwater and surface water in addition our tap water has bicarbonate concentrations shown in table 1 that fall within the range associated with groundwater saha et al 2019 therefore it is reasonable to use this tap to represent ground water to investigate the removal mechanisms as iii removal and arsenic speciation i e as v and as iii were evaluated in different synthetic salt solutions e g na2so4 nacl and a mixture of na2so4 mgso4 and caso4 that had similar conductivity 404 9 3 6 μs cm to real tap water 358 0 0 9 μs cm in tap water tests experiments were run for 2 h before samples were collected at ocp to investigate as iii removal of the uncharged membranes then 3 5 and 7 v cell potentials membrane as cathode were sequentially applied with each potential being applied for 30 min under ocp conditions as iii removal by the cnt uf membrane was 8 9 1 7 fig 2 a suggesting that sorption could remove a limited amount of as iii this corresponds with previous cnt adsorption studies which showed that cnts have a limited adsorption capacity towards as iii i e 13 5 µg g ali 2018 negative potentials applied to the cnt uf membranes significantly increased as iii rejection with rejection increasing with an increase of the applied potential fig 2a with a low operating pressure i e 0 9 0 1 psi i e 6 2 kpa 0 7 kpa 8 9 1 0 l m2 h cnt uf membranes achieved as iii removal as high as 72 6 5 1 when 7 v was applied lower potentials yielded lower rejection fig 2a but these rejection values were still significantly higher than as iii rejection reported for by the majority of high pressure nf or ro membranes fig 2b and table 3 the flux of the cnt uf membranes slightly increased with an increase in potential i e when the applied cell potential was 5 v in fig 2c likely because the applied potential increased the local ph which further deprotonated carboxyl groups on the cnts and made the membrane more hydrophilic over time higher potentials led to flux decline 93 4 10 3 of original flux due to scaling caused by the high local ph it is noted that the ph of the feed is supposed to be constant because all the permeate was returned to the feed however the feed ph slightly dropped from 7 69 to 7 23 over the course of the experiment likely due to the precipitation of mg oh 2 on the membrane surface ni cnt uf membranes further enhanced as iii rejection in tap water to 93 3 3 9 when a cell potential of 7 v was applied with a flux of 9 1 0 4 l m2 h operating pressure 4 1 2 9 psi i e 28 2 20 0 kpa fig 2a which is close to the minimum removal i e 98 7 for 750 µg l as iii needed to achieve the mcl 10 µg l as set by the epa it is worth noting that we tested our membranes under highly challenging conditions i e 90 of total arsenic was in as iii form these conditions only occur in 29 of 65 wells investigated across the usa sorg et al 2014 while as v is the predominant arsenic species in 31 of 65 wells sorg et al 2014 considering that as v is much easier to be removed than as iii by membranes singh et al 2015 that as concentrations ranged between 19 89 µg l in the us well water survey and that we could remove 93 3 3 9 of as iii it is reasonable to expect that the mcl could be achieved by our membranes in most of cases sorg et al 2014 the flux through the ni cnt uf membrane declined with increasing cathodic potentials fig 2c this is likely a result of mineral scaling that forms on the membrane surface a result of the locally elevated ph conditions the low as iii rejection achieved by conventional uf nf ro membrane processes is due to the uncharged form of as iii h3aso3 in most natural systems the first pka of h3aso3 is 9 23 sadiq et al 1983 ma et al 2020 however the application of cathodic potentials increases the local ph on the cnt uf and ni cnt uf membrane surface as evident by the elevated ph of the permeate ph of 10 9 0 1 and 11 8 0 1 for the cnt uf and ni cnt uf respectively this ph is higher than the first pka of as iii i e 9 23 converting h3aso3 to its charged form h2aso3 this ionic form of as iii i e h2aso3 is rejected by the negatively charged membranes due to powerful electrostatic repulsive forces induced by the applied potential dudchenko et al 2014 importantly the ph at the membrane water interface is likely higher than these values but is impossible to be measured directly based on our simulations section 2 5 the ph at the membrane surface was close to 13 figure s2 this ph is near above the second pka of h3aso3 i e 12 13 potentially leading to the formation of haso3 2 whose increased negative charge would enable even more efficient electrostatic repulsion and higher rejection in addition to transforming as iii to its charged form the elevated ph conditions along the membrane surface led to the precipitation of metal hydroxides and carbonates e g mg oh 2 caco3 evident by the flux decline at higher applied potentials fig 2c which was particularly apparent when the ni cnt uf membranes were tested however metal hydroxides can play an important role in arsenic removal fig 2d shows as iii rejection by cnt uf membranes under different synthetic salt solutions having similar conductivity to tap water the presence of mg and ca in the feed significantly enhanced the rejection of as iii fig 2d we speculate that this is because precipitates formed by mg ca e g caco3 and or mg oh 2 can adsorb as iii the geochemist workbench software package predicted that mg oh 2 was the dominant mineral formed on the surface of the membrane i e when ph was over 10 5 and the concentrations of mg2 and ca2 were 10 ppm and 50 ppm respectively fig 2e therefore we hypothesize that mg oh 2 is the main species responsible for arsenic adsorption previous studies have reported that mg oh 2 is an effective sorbent for both as v and as iii at high ph i e ph 11 mcneill and edwards 1997 a previous study has also shown that nanostructured mgo has a high removal capacity for arsenic liu et al 2011 edx analysis of a scaled membrane surface confirmed that the accumulated scale was primarily composed of mg containing minerals figure s3b d it is possible that competing ions e g phosphate could influence the adsorption of arsenic pincus et al 2020 however the concentration of phosphate was low in the tap water table 1 in addition as iii rejection in the presence of nacl was slightly lower than that in the presence of na2so4 fig 2d which is possibly because reactive chlorine species rcs formed on the anode compete with the water reduction reaction on the cathode kim et al 2014 which led to a lower ph along the membrane that reduced as iii ion formation the conversion of as iii to as v is desirable because as v is less toxic and mobile than as iii sharma and sohn 2009 as iii may be directly oxidized on the anode or oxidized by rcs or other oxidizing agents formed on the anode or cathode kim et al 2014 in the presence of chloride ions i e in the nacl solution as v concentrations in the feed increased from 18 4 to 30 3 from 30 min to 1 h fig 2f while as v levels only increased slightly from 14 1 to 17 3 when the feed was na2so4 fig 2f this indicates that direct oxidation of as iii by the platinum coated titanium anode was slow and rcs produced from chloride oxidation were largely responsible for the oxidation of as iii in the bulk feed kim et al 2014 interestingly nearly 100 of arsenic in both na2so4 and nacl feed solutions was oxidized to as v in the permeate fig 2f indicating that as iii was primarily oxidized to as v as it passed through the cathodic membrane rather than at the anode or in the bulk feed e g by rcs this is counter intuitive as reduction reactions are typical on the cathodic membranes we speculate that hydrogen peroxide produced through the electroreduction of oxygen was responsible for the oxidation of as iii to as v qian et al 2015 we measured approximately 50 µg l h2o2 in the permeate oxygen the precursor of hydrogen peroxide could come from the air or the anode where water splitting reactions produce oxygen and oxygen can diffuse to the cathode kim et al 2014 oxidation of as iii by electrochemically generated h2o2 on a cathode was first observed and studied by qian et al in 2015 who noted that high ph the presence of humic acid hco3 ca2 and mg2 could enhance the oxidation process qian et al 2015 since these conditions are commonly found in drinking water sources this mechanism can explain the conversion of as iii to as v as the compounds move through the membrane cathode unfortunately it is impossible to rule out the possibility that oxidization of as iii to as v occurs during preparation of icp ms samples i e stabilizing samples with 5 nitric acid the presence of oxygen is inevitable because the oxygen evolution reaction occurs on the anode and this gas may diffuse to the cathode therefore experiments in zero oxygen conditions are difficult to accomplish also our results indicated that as v wasn t reduced to as iii by our cathodic membranes likely because of as v s electrochemical inactivity huiliang et al 1988 it is noted that nickel layer on the top of cnts is a mixture of ni 0 and ni oh 2 hou et al 2018 ni oh 2 is reported to be stable in the presence of h2o2 yan et al 2012 and ni 0 is also highly resistant to h2o2 in neutral or alkaline conditions wilbraham et al 2018 importantly there is a highly reductive and alkaline environment around the ni cnt uf membranes as we are applying cathodic potentials suggesting that the leaching of ni2 is highly unlikely also a recent study found that little ni dissolved at ph 12 after 50 h operating with a ni activated carbon cathode kim et al 2018 therefore it is reasonable to conclude that ni cnt uf membranes are resistant to trace h2o2 formed in the cathode 3 3 scaling and cleaning while electroactive membranes have been demonstrated to be able to prevent multiple forms of fouling including biofouling ronen et al 2015 and organic fouling dudchenko et al 2014 the application of high cathodic potentials such as were used here to achieve good rejection inevitably lead to the formation of mineral scaling by mg oh 2 and caco3 on the membrane surface fig 3 sequential testing of a ni cnt uf membrane to remove as iii from tap water showed a 36 15 decline in flux after 300 min fig 3a a 5 minute backwash and a 5 minute crossflow with di water could recover the membrane flux for three sequential cycles fig 3a however the flux decline in each of these sequential cycles was more rapid than the first round with flux declining by approximately 46 3 average decline of 2nd 3rd and 4th run within 100 min indicating that the cleaning process led to incomplete scale removal more rigorous chemical cleaning e g a periodic weak acid rinse under cathodic protection pierozynski et al 2009 would likely be needed to completely recover the membrane surface it is critical to note that the backwash water is toxic as it contains arsenic adsorbed by magnesium hydroxide it has been reported that such materials arsenic sorbed onto mg oh 2 can be used as additives in cement manufacturing where they can be safely sequestered in concrete products tresintsi et al 2014 3 4 economic analysis the treatment costs of arsenic in drinking water are highly dependent on the dominant as species and the technology used and span a very wide range between near zero e g laterite absorption to as high as 70 m3 shan et al 2019 several highly affordable engineering methods e g coagulation and flocculation are available to effectively remove as v under normal drinking water conditions however there are few options to cheaply remove as iii directly i e without pre oxidization steps particularly using point of use applications for example even household ro considered by many as the gold standard of point of use systems can only achieve 50 as iii removal walker et al 2008 with other treatment technologies such as nf achieving even lower removal in contrast our electroactive uf membranes are highly effective at removing as iii as a result it is not straight forward to compare the treatment costs of water dominated by as iii contamination in our treatment system the additional cost of electricity plays an important role in the overall operating cost of the process with increasing energy associated with higher voltages these higher voltages also enable higher rejection of as iii fig 2a in other words the energy required to achieve acceptable permeate as iii concentrations i e 10 µg l increases linearly with increasing as iii concentrations in the feed stream fig 4 in this figure the required energy to reduce the permeate concentration to below 10 µg l was calculated based on the experimental data presented in fig 2a to account for the average lower flux caused by the membrane fouling we assumed that the average flux is 60 of the initial flux which is the average flux during the 4 experimental runs in addition based on a recent epa study contaminated well water in the usa contains anywhere between 0 3 68 µg l as iii sorg et al 2014 based on these initial concentrations and an average flux i e 60 of the initial flux the energy required to treat this water ranges between 1 94 kwh m3 for the case where the initial concentration is just above the maximum allowable limit 11 µg l to 12 00 kwh m3 if the as iii concentration is 68 µg l based on the average cost of household electricity in the usa 0 167 kwh for the usa west coast the additional electrical costs range between 0 32 m3 and 2 00 m3 in addition this cost is highly sensitive to flux duan et al 2017 e g the additional electrical costs could drop to between 0 09 m3 i e 0 57 kwh m3 and 0 59 m3 i e 3 56 kwh m3 if the initial flux increased to 27 l m2 h which is a reasonable flux for a uf process few studies report the total cost i e the sum of capita and operating costs of a household uf system a single study reports that the total cost of a household uf treatment system is approximately 0 10 m3 of product water praneeth et al 2014 but the system contains a hand pump and is not particularly relevant when pressurized water lines are available as is the case in the vast majority of the developed world it is reported that the cost of household ro system is as high as 3 4 m3 of product water wang et al 2011 while the cost of industrial scale ro treated water ranges from 0 38 to 0 52 m3 of produced water jung et al 2020 if we assume that the cost of household uf scales similarly to household ro the ratio of household ro cost to industrial ro costs 3 4 m3 to 0 45 m3 we can estimate the cost of a household uf system from the cost of an industrial uf drinking water treatment plant i e 0 28 m3 duan et al 2017 therefore the total cost of a household uf system is estimated at 2 1 m3 considering an additional energy related operating cost of 0 35 m3 i e 2 07 kwh m3 calculated assuming an initial as iii concentration of 39 50 µg l i e the mid point between 11 µg l and 68 µg l and additional material cost i e from the addition of cnts and nickel of approximately 0 03 m3 assumes membrane could be used for 1 year see detailed calculations in the si the total cost i e operating and capital cost of using household ni cnt uf membranes to treat arsenic contaminated water is 2 48 m3 it is noted that the majority of this cost is from the capital costs of a household uf membrane system this cost will be significantly lower for industrial uf systems while this number is speculative it does provide a framework for the solution of as iii removal at the household level it is critical to note that the solution proposed here is to the best of our knowledge the only technological solution capable of removing as iii at a household level without pre oxidizing as iii the oxidation of as iii to as v needed to enable other treatment technologies adds another layer of complexity and cost to the process 4 conclusion this study demonstrates an effective membrane based low pressure as iii removal technology oh ions produced locally on the membrane surface transform neutral h3aso3 to its ionic forms h2aso3 haso3 2 that are effectively rejected by negatively charged ni cnt uf or cnt uf membranes in addition mg oh 2 precipitates on the membrane surface further adsorb as iii which increases removal importantly nearly all as iii passing through the membrane is oxidized to as v transformed by hydrogen peroxide produced on the cathodic membranes which decreases arsenic s mobility and toxicity mineral scaling formed on the membrane could be partially removed by physical cleaning backwash and cross flushing but more rigorous chemical cleaning e g an acid rinse would likely be needed periodically to

16638,insights into microbiota adaptation to increased ammonia stress and identification of indicator microorganisms can help to optimize the operation of anaerobic digesters to identify microbial indicators and investigate their metabolic contribution to acetoclastic methanogenesis am syntrophic acetate oxidation sao or hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis hm 40 anaerobic batch reactors fed with acetate of 110 mmol l were set up at nh4 n concentrations of 0 14 g l 5 00 g l or 7 00 g l inoculated with thermophilic or mesophilic microbiota with or without pre exposure to ammonia stress four stable carbon isotope probing approaches were applied in parallel with 1 2 13c ch3cooh 2 13c ch3cooh 13c nahco3 or non labeled ch3cooh used individually the last three approaches were used to quantify the methanogenic pathways by tracking labeled 13c or natural 13c signatures in the resulting ch4 and co2 and consistently detected the dynamic transition of dominant pathways from am to sao hm under ammonia stress results of quantitative pcr and fluorescence in situ hybridization illustrated the procedure acetotrophic methanogens being outcompeted by acetate oxidizing syntrophs the first and last isotope labeling approaches were designed to probe the active acetate mineralizing microbes with dna sip known acetate oxidizing bacteria like syntrophaceticus and tepidanaerobacter as well as novel members of pseudomonas bacillus and symbiobacteraceae were detected with methanoculleus as the predominant h2 co2 utilizing partner using nanosims some bacterial cells were observed to be fixing co2 from 13c nahco3 in this study methanosaeta was only active with ammonia 200 mg n l the syntrophs catalyzing sao hm started to compete with am conducting methanosarcina at intermediate concentrations of ammonia i e 200 500 mg n l and outcompeted the acetotrophic methanogens with ammonia 500 mg n l under ammonia stress diverse known and novel microbial taxa were involved in acetate mineralization

oxidizing bacteria saob and hydrogenotrophic methanogens form an essential functional guild the guild turns acetate into ch4 and co2 via two different pathways acetoclastic methanogenesis am or syntrophic acetate oxidation sao followed by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis hm saob have been found to replace acetotrophic methanogens as predominant acetate consumers under conditions including increased levels of ammonia hao et al 2017 westerholm et al 2018 elevated temperature dyksma et al 2020 ho et al 2013 or increased organic loading rates li et al 2018 lü et al 2013 which could be caused by a change in operating conditions or in the period when the reactors were starting up saob grow slowly since very limited energy is shared between the bacteria and methanogen partners in the sao hm reaction hattori 2008 westerholm et al 2019 such an adaptation of the microbiota to the changed environment usually results in performance instability or in a long lag phase dai et al 2016 in these circumstances if the predominant functional populations have changed but the digester operation is not adjusted accordingly digester performance may stay in a pseudo steady state fotidis et al 2013b with a relatively low ch4 production rate and long term process instability as sao hm catalyzers may have quite different growth features from am performers a deep understanding of this microbial adaptation procedure would then help to determine the status and to develop tailored operating strategies westerholm et al 2015 such as acclimation puig castellví et al 2020 and bioaugmentation fotidis et al 2013a westerholm et al 2012 to enhance the stability shorten the lag phase and better manage the ad process under stress conditions to this end it is crucial to identify the microbial players of the acetate mineralizing functional guild and to establish reliable links between their roles and sao hm or am pathways sao hm and the relevant functional microorganisms have been studied for two decades and found to be extensively distributed in full scale anaerobic digesters with high ammonia concentrations or in thermophilic conditions hao et al 2016 pan et al 2021 sun et al 2014 using traditional cultivation methods to date only five saob have been isolated and characterized including the mesophilic clostridium ultunense schnürer et al 1996 and syntrophaceticus schinkii westerholm et al 2010 the thermotolerant tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans westerholm et al 2011 and the thermophilic pseudothermotoga lettingae balk et al 2002 bhandari and gupta 2014 and thermacetogenium phaeum hattori et al 2000 members of methanoculleus or methanothermobacter were found to live as the h2 co2 consuming partners in co culture with these bacteria nevertheless the well studied saob are usually present at low abundance in the complex microbiota or may not even be detectable in several reactors showing a significant contribution of sao hao et al 2016 mosbæk et al 2016 puig castellví et al 2020 werner et al 2014 high throughput sequencing based techniques have been used to search for potential saob based on the relative abundance of the taxon or on the detection of functional genes like fhs in specific members dyksma et al 2020 müller et al 2013 nobu et al 2015 several attempts have also been made to enrich saob by incubation with acetate as sole source of organic carbon dyksma et al 2020 ho et al 2016 li et al 2009 wang et al 2018 werner et al 2014 westerholm et al 2018 zheng et al 2019 results indicated the involvement of diverse novel bacterial taxa thereby significantly extending the repository of proposed saob candidates however the phylogenetic relationship between these newly proposed saob candidates derived from individual studies is not yet known it is not clear whether they were widespread or were only detected in an isolated study and if they did catalyze sao since synchronous analyses of metabolic pathways and microbial populations were not carried out in some studies a detailed comparison is thus needed to better interpret the relationship between the diverse saob candidates in ad systems am is mainly catalyzed by methanogens belonging to the genera methanosaeta and methanosarcina however some members of the methanosarcina genus can use both acetate and h2 co2 as methanogenic precursors thauer et al 2008 sometimes it is difficult to clearly distinguish the metabolic type of these populations between am hm or even sao de vrieze et al 2012 dyksma et al 2020 hao et al 2015 dynamic analyses of metabolic pathways along with changes in the microbial composition can help to pinpoint the function of dominant microbial populations in a specific circumstance which could help to overcome the aforementioned problems ch4 producing pathways were quantified by tracking stable carbon isotope 13c released from the methyl carbon labeled acetate substrate which was only used ex situ in batch incubation werner et al 2014 in addition apparent 13c fractionation factor α c was used to characterize the methanogenic pathway by calculating the ratio of the natural 13c signature of co2 δ 13co2 to that of ch4 δ 13ch4 in biogas whiticar et al 1986 and thus can be applied in situ in both lab scale and full scale digesters hao et al 2016 ho et al 2014 polag et al 2015 this method is based on the observation that microbes preferentially utilize 12c during methanogenesis and hm exhibits significantly larger fractionation factors and lower δ 13ch4 than am α c 1 065 or 1 055 usually characterize predominance of hm or am conrad 2005 in the context of acetate mineralization this method can be used to study the relative contribution of acetate cleavage from am or oxidation from sao with oxidation leading to higher α c values due to stronger selection of 12c to ch4 during the followed hm activity α c is a composite parameter based on several assumptions one of which is that the co2 precursor for hm comes from the co2 carbonate system whiticar et al 1986 thus it only gives a rough estimation of the predominant pathway especially in complex environmental microbiota neverthless the efficiency of α c in distinguishing am and sao hm can be confirmed or refined with 13c labeling methods that provide the absolutely quantitative information needed to improve the methodology the aim of this study was to quantitatively investigate the dynamic change in ad microbiota with respect to both metabolic pathways and active microbial members when exposed to ammonia stress in acetate fed batch reactors the influence of temperature and acclimation on microbial behavior was studied using high and low ammonia concentrations the inoculating microbiota originated from two anaerobic reactors that were previously shown to be dominated by am under low ammonia concentrations hao et al 2015 2017 during the incubation three different stable isotope labeling approaches were applied in parallel to dynamically quantify the pathways and to compare the methods qpcr was used to record the number of major methanogenic populations and fluorescence in situ hybridization fish with confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm was used to visualize the cell morphologies and distribution dna stable isotope probing dna sip with simultaneous 13c and 15n labeling was used to track down the active microbial players which were further compared with those found in previous studies nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry nanosims was used to observe enrichment of isotope labels in microbial cells this is the first work to profile the microbial transition under stress using such integrated approaches 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculating microbiota two types of anaerobic sludge biomass were used as the source microbiota the biomasses originated from a mesophilic reactor operated at 35 c named m or a thermophilic reactor operated at 55 c named t for details see supplementary section 1 1 to prepare inocula with and without acclimation microbiota m and t were pre incubated anaerobically with nh4 n of 0 14 g l 5 00 g l for m or 7 00 g l for t in basic medium supplementary section 1 1 with 80 mmol l acetate the inocula resulting from pre incubation with 5 00 or 7 00 g n l were considered as acclimated and named ma and ta while the inocula resulting from 0 14 g n l were considered as non acclimated and named mna and tna fig 1 when methane production ceased after 32 days fig s1 the microbial solids were collected by centrifugation at 8 000 g for 5 min and used as inoculating microbiota at a concentration of 4 00 g l of volatile solids in further batch experiments 2 2 13c and 15n labeling experiment the four different inocula were then respectively incubated at low 0 14 g n l and high 5 00 g n l for m or 7 00 g n l for t concentrations of ammonium in 327 ml serum bottles fisher scientific resulting in eight sets of anaerobic batch reactors fig 1 the high nh4 n concentrations were used to initiate a shift in the predominant pathway under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions as demonstrated previously hao et al 2017 nh4cl was added as a source of ammonia stress and nitrogen for microbial growth acetic acid 110 mmol l was used as the sole source of organic carbon nahco3 140 mmol l and k2co3 20 mmol l were added to provide buffering capacity each set included five reactors r1 r5 with different carbon and nitrogen isotope labeling approaches table s1 r1 and r2 were run without any 13c or 15n labeled compounds r3 was fed with 2 13c ch3cooh 99 sigma r4 was fed with 1 2 13c ch3cooh 99 sigma r5 was fed with 50 of 13c nahco3 98 isotec and r3 r5 with 15n nh4cl 99 sigma reactors r3 and r5 were set to quantify the contribution of am or sao hm to acetate mineralization by monitoring 13c flow to ch4 and co2 in the biogas r4 was set for dna sip to track the active microbial members assimilating 13c from acetate r1 and r2 served as controls for dna sip and also to evaluate ch4 production pathways by analyzing the natural 13c signature of biogas r1 r4 and r5 were filled with respectively 73 ml and 63 ml of basic medium with addition of acetate nh4cl and bi carbonates the initial ph was adjusted to 6 5 0 1 with 1 0 mol l hcl and kept below 8 5 throughout incubation the headspace was filled with n2 gas reactors inoculated with ma and mna or ta and tna were incubated at 35 c or 55 c statically during incubation gas and liquid samples were taken periodically using syringes and stored for further analyses 2 3 ch4 production and ammonia calculation ch4 yield was calculated by monitoring the gas pressure and ch4 composition in the headspace as described previously hao et al 2017 the modified gompertz three parameter model was fitted to the cumulative ch4 yield curve of each reactor zwietering et al 1990 simulated ch4 yield and daily production rates were then predicted from the fitting curves the ph and the acetate concentration in the liquid phase were analyzed as detailed previously hao et al 2017 the concentration of free ammonia nh3 was calculated based on the ph temperature and total ammonium nh4 concentration hao et al 2015 details are provided in supplementary sections 1 2 1 4 2 4 contribution of the sao hm pathway quantified with 13c in the biogas natural 13c signatures δ 13ch4 and δ 13co2 were analyzed in reactors r1 and r2 and 13c compositions of ch4 13ch4 and co2 13co2 were analyzed in reactors r3 and r5 as detailed in supplementary section 1 2 13ch4 and 13co2 were used to calculate the percentage contribution of pathways sao hm f sao hm and am f am based on the source of carbon used to produce ch4 and co2 in the sao hm pathway acetate is oxidized to h2 and co2 the resulting h2 then reduces co2 to ch4 the co2 precursor is assumed to originate from the co3 2 hco3 co2 system conversely in the am pathway carbon in ch4 only originates from the methyl group of ch3coo therefore in reactor r3 with 2 13c ch3cooh 13ch4 is calculated as 1 δ 13 c h 4 100 f am δ 13 c o 2 f sao hm f sao hm is hence calculated as 2 f sao hm 100 δ 13 ch 4 100 δ 13 co 2 100 in reactor r5 13c nahco3 is the sole 13c source and 13ch4 can be only generated via sao hm thus 13ch4 is calculated as 3 δ 13 ch 4 δ 13 co 2 f sao hm and f sao hm is calculated as 4 f sao hm δ 13 ch 4 δ 13 co 2 100 in reactors r1 and r2 α c is calculated as follows whiticar et al 1986 5 α c δ 13 co 2 10 3 δ 13 ch 4 10 3 2 5 fish clsm and fish nanosims biomass samples were fixed for fish analysis as described previously daims et al 2005 probes eub338 arc915 mx825 ms1414 and mg1200 were used to target respectively bacteria archaea methanosaetaceae methanosarcinaceae and methanomicrobiales crocetti et al 2006 which were labeled with fluorescent dyes and the signals were observed with clsm fish nanosims was used to compare the spatial location of 13c and 15n in microbial cells with the brominated bacterial probe eub338 cell isotopic enrichment was calculated as described previously chapleur et al 2013 details are given in supplementary sections 1 5 1 6 2 6 qpcr dna sip and pyrosequencing dna was extracted from liquid aliquots sampled periodically from the reactors and used as templates for qpcr to quantify total bacteria and the different methanogen populations dna samples derived from reactors r4 and r1 or r2 with and without 13c 15n labeling were used for dna sip based on the cscl buoyant density gradient total dna was separated into heavy and light fractions that were respectively collected and used for pyrosequencing supplementary section 1 7 primer pairs 349f 806r and 28f 519r were used to target archaea and bacteria the sequences were further analyzed with qiime software and taxonomic classification of the generated otus was conducted with qiime 2 s q2 feature classifier plugin bokulich et al 2018 based on the silva ssu database version 138 1 several otus enriching 13c from acetate were selected to compare with potential saob proposed in previous studies the raw reads have been deposited in european nucleotide archive under the project prjeb44265 datas2 details are provided in supplementary sections 1 7 1 11 3 results 3 1 acetate to methane the transformation procedure differed the added acetate was consistently converted into ch4 in about 10 days in all the reactors containing nh4 n of 0 14 g l low conversion also took place in reactors with nh4 n of 5 00 g l or 7 00 g l high but progressed differently fig 2 in the case of non acclimated microbiota a first active ch4 production period was followed by an intermediate lag phase of 11 55 days with no obvious generation of ch4 after which methanogenic activity resumed tna also displayed an initial lag phase of 23 days before the first active period in the case of acclimated microbiota ma demonstated low methanogenic activity in the first period of 50 60 days after which ch4 production became quite active ta behaved slightly differently with an initial lag phase of 20 30 days followed by high methanogenic activity in the five reactors operated in parallel some variations in the recovery speed of methanogenesis were observed especially for ma 3 2 multiple isotope tracking approaches quantitatively recorded the gradual involvement of sao pathway three 13c tracking approaches were used to quantitate the contribution of sao hm pathway by tracking 13c flow into ch4 and co2 from 2 13c ch3cooh in reactor r3 or 13c nahco3 in reactor r5 or by monitoring the natural 13c signature of biogas in reactors r1 and r2 the 13c contents detected in ch4 and co2 are illustrated in fig 3 a l as can be seen in fig 3 m p f sao hm caculated from 13ch4 and 13co2 was similar in r3 and r5 when the concentration of ammonium was low ch4 was mainly produced via the am pathway with f sao hm generally 10 at high ammonium concentrations f sao hm gradully increased from 10 in the initial period to 80 100 when methanogenesis recovered from the lag phase in the later period thermophilic microbiota demonstrated higher f sao hm values 100 than mesophilic microbiota 80 90 and 13c compositions in ch4 13ch4 and co2 13co2 started to overlap fig 3 b d f h suggesting that carbon in the resulting ch4 came from a balanced co2 bicarbonate carbonate system in which equilibrium was reached between the gaseous and liquid phases α c was calculated from δ 13ch4 and δ 13co2 in r1 and r2 fig 3 q t shows that when the concentration of ammonium was low α c gradually decreased from 1 066 to 1 028 during the active ch4 producing period indicating a higher contribution of am pathway with high concentrations of ammonium α c values of non acclimated microbiota were 1 077 1 051 for tna and 1 048 1 041 for mna in the first active ch4 producing period and increased to 1 090 1 102 when methanogenesis recovered from the intermediate lag phase demonstrating that the predominant pathway shifted to sao hm the acclimated microbiota behaved differently ta displayed α c values of around 1 070 in the initial lag phase and the values increased to 1 094 when methanogenesis became quite active showing predominance of sao hm throughout ma displayed α c values that mostly fluctuated between 1 062 and 1 040 in the slow and active ch4 producing periods revealing a higher contribution of am when the competition between am and sao hm was quantified most r1 and r2 reactors showed a similar trend to that observed in r3 and r5 reactors it is confirmed that α c can be used to efficiently monitor a change in the pathway during acetate transformation into ch4 neverthless parallel ma reactors with high ammonium concentrations differed in their metabolic pathways r3 and r5 demonstrated a gradually increasing contribution of sao hm to 80 90 by contrast r1 and r2 displayed a mixture of the two pathways with am sometimes contributing more suggesting different changes in microbial composition as discussed below 3 3 visualizing the gradual development of acetate oxidizing syntrophs 16s rrna gene copy numbers of major methanogenic members and total bacteria were analyzed with qpcr including the genera methanosarcina family methanosarcinaceae and methanoculleus order methanomicrobiales the family methanosaetaceae and the order methanobacteriales figs 4 s2 the numbers of methanoculleus increased by three orders of magnitude in most reactors with high ammonium concentrations when methanogenesis recovered from the lag phase i e from the initial 103 copies ng dna to 106 copies ng dna but in ma h r4 there was a smaller increase to only 105 copies ng dna growth of methanosarcina in mesophilic microbiota differed either increasing from 102 to 106 or 105 copies ng dna in ma h r4 or ma h r5 and mna h r5 or did not change much in mna h r4 in thermophilic microbiota methanosarcina and methanosaetaceae both underwent one log fold decrease after 100 days of incubation in treatments with high ammonium concentrations however no notable change was observed for methanobacteriales which may be not active in this condition supplementary section 2 1 the appearance of methanogens and bacteria was recorded in fish images figs 5 s3 initially mesophilic and thermophilic microbiota were dominated by the rod shaped cells of methanosaetaceae and large cell aggregates of methanosarcinaceae respectively the signals emitted by these cells were gradually quenched under high ammonium concentrations and replaced by the appearance of cell clusters of bacteria and methanomicrobiales bacterial cells in mesophilic reactors were of different shapes including rods 2 5 μm in length and around 0 5 μm in width and a bamboo like cascade of short rods fig s3w in thermophilic reactors bacterial cells were longer rods 5 10 μm in length and around 0 5 μm in width these differences showed that different bacterial taxa were growing at different temperatures cells of methanomicrobiales displayed cocci with a diameter of 1 μm at both temperatures and were loosely assembled with bacterial cells cell aggregates of methanosarcinaceae of different sizes 3 20 μm in diameter appeared in most mesophilic reactors containing a high concentration of ammonium but were not observed in mna h r4 and mna h r1 fig s3 datas1 both qpcr and fish results revealed that in mesophilic reactors under ammonia stress the involvement of methanosarcinaceae to different extents could explain the different progress of recovery of methanogenesis and the diverged pathway compositions in parallel reactors we observed that when methanogenic activity recovered the abundance of either methanosarcina or methanoculleus reached a level 106 copies ng dna similar to that of the initially dominating methanosaetaceae in mesophilic microbiota or methanosarcina in thermophilic microbiota before the recovery of methanogenesis the lag phase was about 10 days shorter when large aggregates of methanosarcinaceae cells appeared datas1 suggesting the growth rate of methanosarcinaceae was higher than that of acetate oxidizing syntrophs furthermore the dominance of methanosarcinaceae members in ma h r1 r2 fig s3 was found to be in line with higher am activity in the same reactors in contrast higher abundance of methanomicrobiales cells in ma h r3 r5 figs s3 5 was accompanied by the predominance of sao hm pathway such microbial divergence phenomena have previously been observed when stress factors occurred and affected the microbiota in the reactors goux et al 2015 westerholm et al 2018 in the present study we hypothesize that ammonia stress added further stochasticity to changes in microbial community structure de vrieze et al 2020 which requires further investigation 3 4 quantification of the influence of free ammonia dynamic changes in methanogenic activities could be due to interactions between the functional microbial players and changing environmental factors as shown in fig s4a in parallel with increased methane production the ph gradually increased due to consumption of ch3coo leading to further transformation of nh4 into nh3 in mesophilic conditions the concentration of nh3 increased from 25 to 519 mg n l in reactors with a high concentration of ammonium but to less than 31 mg n l in reactors with a low concentration of ammonium in thermophilic conditions the values were 50 to 2 106 mg n l in reactors with a high concentration of ammonium and 50 mg n l in reactors with a low concentration of ammonium f sao hm which could also be considered as a percentage of inhibited am changed with the concentration of nh3 like the dose response model f sao hm started to significantly increase at an nh3 concentration of around 200 mg n l and reached 100 when the level of nh3 exceeded 500 mg n l fig s4b the change in α c with nh3 showed a similar concomitant increasing trend when the nh3 concentration was higher than 200 mg n l α c values 1 065 started to appear and when the nh3 level exceeded 500 mg l α c value increased to 1 075 likewise the number of methanoculleus displayed a 2 to 3 log fold increase when nh3 n exceeded 200 mg l like methanosarcina in some of the mesophilic reactors therefore the increasing nh3 concentration probably triggered the replacement of acetotrophic methanogens by acetate oxidizing syntrophs 3 5 involvement of diverse bacterial and archaeal members identified via dna sip to identify microorganisms that actively assimilate acetate the microbiota was incubated with 1 2 13c ch3cooh and 15n nh4cl or unlabeled compounds total dna was extracted from samples taken when methanogenesis actively recovered from inhibition and was further separated into different fractions based on buoyant density fig s5 as detailed in supplementary section 2 2 dna fractions enriched with 13c and 15n were clearly separated from fractions without thereby guaranteeing isolation of metabolic active microorganisms bacteria and archaea compositions were analyzed in both heavy and light dna fractions that represent active and inert microbial consortia respectively fig 6 a b shows that in thermophilic microbiota bacterial members of the genus syntrophaceticus otus 213 281 128 164 294 the genus bacillus otus 296 609 and archaeal members of the genus methanoculleus otus 77 0 36 35 19 were much more abundant mostly tenfold higher in the heavy dna than in the light suggesting syntrophism between syntrophaceticus and or bacillus with methanoculleus by contrast in mesophilic microbiota bacterial taxa other than syntrophaceticus were significantly enriched in 13c and 15n including members of the genus pseudomonas otu 292 the genus bacillus otu 296 and the family symbiobacteraceae otus 421 40 additionally various archaeal members of the genus methanoculleus otus 77 39 41 2 0 36 35 19 rumen m2 otu 2 also named methanomassiliicoccales archaeon rumen m2 and the genus methanosarcina otu 81 were more abundant in heavy dna indicating involvement of diverse bacterial and archaeal taxa in acetate mineralization in addition to temperature acclimation was shown to have some influence on the composition of active microbial communities for instance the otus of syntrophaceticus that dominated in tna h r4 and ta h r4 were not the same uncultured symbiobacteraceae mainly appeared in mna h r4 but not in ma h r4 while methanosarcina otu81 was detected in ma h r4 but not in mna h r4 as also observed with qpcr and fish analyses these otus represented the predominant active microbial players relative abundance 1 among them only the five otus of the genus syntrophaceticus detected in thermophilic microbiota shared 95 96 similarity with s schinkii and none of the others exactly matched the well studied saob further investigation of the less abundant otus 1 detected t acetatoxydans in the heavy dna from tna otu18 relative abundance 0 3 otu107 and otu542 of the genus tepidanaerobacter both increased tenfold in the heavy dna compared with in the light dna from tna 0 05 to 0 49 and ma 0 1 to 0 9 respectively fig 6 c datas2 members of genera alkaliphilus and dtu014 have already been described as potential saob as they encode genes that are essential for sao and were found to be highly abundant in high ammonia anaerobic digesters dyksma et al 2020 mosbæk et al 2016 müller et al 2016 in the present study otu532 of the genus alkaliphilus increased markedly in the heavy dna compared with in the light dna from mna 0 03 to 0 36 and ta 0 to 0 15 and three otus of dtu014 otus35 83 563 mainly appeared in the heavy dna from tna 0 56 these otus can be considered as relatives of known or candidate saob their appearance at such low abundance probably cannot explain all the sao activities especially in mna where sao hm contributed 90 to methane production in the late period the role of symbiobacteraceae members that prevailed in this condition was thus highlighted supplementary section 2 3 3 6 evidence for co2 fixing bacteria provided by nanosims various novel bacterial taxa were found to be involved in acetate mineralization possibly assimilating acetate or the resulting metabolites like formate and co2 to check whether co2 could be one of the carbon sources the microbiota incubated with 13c nahco3 was sampled after 81 days and analyzed using nanosims figs 7 and s10 show rod shape bacterial cells enriched in 13c and 15n at maximum values of 7 0 and 91 0 respectively values that were 8 0 and 91 0 for the adjacent spherical cells of methanomicrobiales these 13c enrichment values in the biomass were similar to the values of 13co2 8 9 and 13ch4 8 1 at the time evidence that some bacteria were actively fixing inorganic carbon while using nh4 n as nitrogen source for growth 4 discussion 4 1 multiple isotope tracking approaches can quantify acetate mineralizing pathways in this study for the first time four different 13c and 15n labeling approaches were applied in parallel and quantitatively tracked both the metabolic pathways and the active microbial players during acetate conversion into ch4 our results show that using 2 13c ch3cooh and 13c nahco3 led to the same conclusion when acetate was thoroughly converted via the sao hm pathway 13ch4 values started to overlap with 13co2 indicating that co2 the hm precursor was derived from the balanced co2 bicarbonate carbonate system therefore analyzing the 13c flow from 13c labeled carbonate bicarbonate is a viable alternative method to accurately quantify the contribution of sao pathway to acetate conversion especially when considerable amounts of residual acetate exist in the target system that could dilute the added 13c labeled acetate results obtained using natural 13c fractionation generally demonstrated a similar trend to that using 13c labeling approaches we observed differences between αc values derived from am 1 000 and sao hm 1 102 as high as 0 102 enabling us to clearly monitor the gradual change in the methanogenic pathways using the natural 13c signature it should be noted that a gradual decrease in αc value within a narrow range was observed alongside a rapid degradation in acetate at relatively low concentrations of ammonia but this might not be a sign of increasing am contribution as f sao hm remained stable at low values 10 as meaured by the isotope labeling methods used in parallel this decrease may be related to the change in the isotopic composition of the remaining acetate pool which became increasingly enriched in 13c during the conversion process meaning this result should be intepreted with caution 4 2 appearance of novel bacterial and archaeal members in acetate enrichments 4 2 1 novel bacterial taxa acetate fed batch incubation with high concentrations of ammonia enriched diverse bacterial and archaeal taxa that mineralized acetate mostly via the sao hm pathway the thermophilic microbiota was dominated by various taxa of syntrophaceticus and methanoculleus the two most commonly found genera forming acetate oxidizing syntrophs in high ammonia ad but in mesophilic microbiota the known saob or reported candidates only accounted for 3 of enriched bacterial communities instead novel members of pseudomonas bacillus and uncultured symbiobacteraceae which have not yet been shown to possess sao capability were found to be actively involved however such observations have been reported in previous studies we thus compared the novel microbial taxa found in our work and in four other acetate enrichment experiments performed individually supplementary sections 1 8 1 9 results show that members of these genera were also abundant in other acetate enrichments for instance pseudomonas was enriched with acetate in batch incubation dyksma et al 2020 li et al 2009 werner et al 2014 or chemostat westerholm et al 2018 from microbiota that originated from thermophilic or mesophilic digesters treating various organic wastes with nh4 n ranging from 0 26 g l to 5 00 g l nine relevant otus were selected from the five studies the abundance of which was mostly 1 in the microbial communities their representative sequences shared from 88 9 to 99 6 similarity and were assigned to the genera pseudomonas and thiopseudomonas both belonging to the family pseudomonadaceae datas3 these results suggest that various pseudomonas members and close relatives are widespread in ad and can be enriched with acetate therein the four representative sequences 1 000 bp in length were most closely related to pseudomonas sp m 08 ab567742 and pseudomonas sp hy 14 eu620679 2 with 97 similarity fig s8 both closest relatives were denitrifying bacteria isolated from activated or anaerobic sludge rich in ammonia xiao et al 2009 it is not sure if they are involved in the nitrogen cycle like anaerobic ammonium oxidation as no nitrate nitrite was initially added in our study members of uncultured symbiobacteraceae and bacillus were also abundantly detected in studies by westerholm et al 2018 and dyksma et al 2020 typical symbiobacteraceae species were described to be anaerobic chemo organotrophic bacteria utilizing sugars with nitrate as electron acceptor or peptone alone shiratori takano et al 2014 in our study symbiobacteraceae and methanoculleus members were found to be absolutely predominant in a microbiota actively catalyzing sao hm and no other known saob were detected these symbiobacteraceae members were thus most probably directly involved in sao activity and were newly identified saob in our work members of bacillus infernus otu609 were only found in thermophilic conditions fig s7 as also reported in the study by westerholm et al 2018 as described previously members of this species can make respiratory use of formate with electron donors like mno2 fe3 and nitrate boone et al 1995 in mesophilic microbiota other bacillus members otu296 different from that of bacillus infernus were found 4 2 2 co2 fixation by bacteria even though diverse bacterial members were enriched in isotope labeled dna the actual carbon source and energy metabolism of the novel members still could not be determined some of the bacterial cells were observed to be growing and assimilating co2 in ma h r5 with 13c nahco3 like the hydrogenotrophic methanogens bacterial co2 fixation is not rare bacillus subtilis w23 was previously reported to incorporate 5 to 6 of 13co2 into microbial biomass during heterotrophic growth reflecting biomass formation involving anaplerotic carboxylation of pyruvate spona friedl et al 2020 likewise symbiobacterium thermophilum watsuji et al 2006 and bacillus anthracis eastin and thorne 1963 were shown to be able to fix external co2 and pseudomonas members have ever been detected in co2 enrichments jeon et al 2012 therefore except for sao metabolism co2 fixation could be one of the ways that make some novel bacterial taxa appear in heavy dna via some as yet unidentified catabolic or anabolic pathways this result shows that dna sip only using 13c labeled acetate cannot fully distinguish the metabolic functions of all the microbial members probed during acetate mineralization to solve this problem further investigation is needed by incubation with a series of labeled substrates including acetate formate and carbonates or by using meta omics approaches to identify the active pathways even though 13c labeled carbonate was used in the present study unfortunately only samples from 13c labeled acetate were preserved for dna sip analysis so we missed the opportunity to distinguish microorganisms assimilating acetate or carbonate co2 4 2 3 diverse methanogens involved all the 19 otus of methanoculleus were enriched in heavy dna indicating active h2 co2 driven methanogenic activities in the reactors tested especially in mna h r4 ta h r4 and tna h r4 methanoculleus contributed to 78 of the archaeal sequences derived from heavy dna growth of the predominant methanoculleus members in these reactors was consistently observed with qpcr and fish supplementary section 2 4 evidence for their prominent role in mineralizing acetate as h2 co2 utilizers these otus shared 93 to 99 similarity with methanoculleus bourgensis a common partner of saob westerholm et al 2019 2012 2011 2010 acetotrophic methanosaeta also appeared in heavy dna but in smaller quantities than in light dna in fish images the cells were observed in the initial slow methane producing period otu68 close to methanosarcina thermophila and otu81 distantly related to known methanosarcina species fig s9 were detected in thermophilic and mesophilic microbiota respectively in fish images the former was only observed at the beginning of incubation in thermophilic reactors while the latter was observed when methanogenic activities recovered from the lag phase in most mesophilic reactors these methanosaeta and methanosarcina members are hypothesized to be responsible for the am activities that occurred in the initial period of incubation or co occurred with sao hm in the recovery period in mesophilic conditions methanomassiliicoccales archaeon rumen m2 a methylotrophic population was surprisingly enriched in heavy dna which has also been reported in mesophilic acetate fed chemostats westerholm et al 2018 in the metagenome assembled genome of rumen m2 the acetyl coa synthetase gene was identified which can catalyze conversion of acetate to acetyl coa rumen m2 members were thus hypothesized to be able to grow heterotrophically on acetate söllinger et al 2016 in our study they might have been using acetate as a carbon source and were consequently probed with isotopes 4 3 pre acclimation accelerated the appearance of stress tolerant microbial players in this work the microbiota was considered to be acclimated by pre exposure to ammonia stress for a 32 day period before being used as inoculum while the non acclimated were not subjected to a pre attack of ammonia stress the acclimated microbiota developed stress tolerant microbial populations faster and methanogenic activities were recovered more rapidly after the lag phase which was 18 46 days shorter than that of the non acclimated microbiota datas1 the active microbial members were however more concentrated in a few otus showed less diversity and evenness than that of non acclimated members these differences were attributed to the impaired activity of the acetotrophic methanogens during pre exposure to ammonia stress when they were the major acetate consumers fig s1 this injury not only slowed down the am reaction in the initial period of the batch tests but also hindered the increase in ph and in the concentration of nh3 due to consumption of ch3coo this provided a relatively stable and less stressful environment for the growth of ammonia tolerant microorganisms like methanosarcina or saob coupled with methanoculleus such populations probably already started to grow during the acclimation period and were added to the batch incubation as seeds but the number of these newly grown seeds must have been very low as no significant difference was observed between acclimated and non acclimated inocula with qpcr probably because acetate in pre incubation was mostly converted by the original predator via the am pathway 4 4 am catalyzing methanosarcina tolerant to medium ammonia stress methanosarcina was repeatedly seen to be active in ad with a medium concentration of ammonia 100 500 mg n l dai et al 2016 de vrieze et al 2012 fotidis et al 2013b hao et al 2015 however it is still not clear which metabolism they catalyze since some of the members can use both acetate and h2 co2 for methanogenesis or even use the electrons directly rotaru et al 2018 in this study methanosarcina cell aggregates appeared in most mesophilic reactors when the concentration of ammonia increased to 200 500 mg n l at the same time methanosaetaceae members were not observed with fish clsm suggesting these members may have become inactive methanosarcina is thus hypothesized to be responsible for the concomitant am activity that contributed 10 to methane production in thermophilic reactors methanosarcina was observed initially when the am pathway predominated but was gradually outcompeted by the hydrogenotrophic methanoculleus when the concentration of ammonia exceeded 500 mg n l therefore methanosarcina mainly catalyzed am at low 200 mg n l to medium concentrations 200 500 mg n l of ammonia generally as can be seen from our results am demonstrated higher reaction rates than sao hm these results indicate that under medium ammonia stress growth of am conducting methanosarcina led to faster consumption of acetate which could be more efficient than the growth of acetate oxidizing syntrophs to optimize digester performance 5 conclusions this work provided deep insights into the acetate metabolizing microbial communities by deciphering the roles of various microbial populations during the transition of metabolism from am to sao hm induced by increasing ammonia stress the dynamic changes in microbial members and functions were monitored by qpcr fish and high throughput sequencing with four isotope tracking approaches solid evidence is provided for syntrophic interactions between syntrophaceticus and methanoculleus as prominent saob and hydrogenotrophic partners under high nh3 stress 500 2100 mg n l am conducting methanosarcina was shown to compete with saob under intermediate levels of nh3 stress 200 430 mg n l and novel bacterial members were shown to be involved the role of uncultured symbiobacteriaceae members as saob was pinpointed in particular bacterial co2 fixation was observed with nanosims indicating competition between autotrophic bacteria and archaea further labeled isotope probing and natural isotope signature approaches were shown to generate highly consistent results in quantifying the am and sao hm pathways the combined application of isotopic techniques with complementary molecular biology methods in this work provides a methodological

16638,insights into microbiota adaptation to increased ammonia stress and identification of indicator microorganisms can help to optimize the operation of anaerobic digesters to identify microbial indicators and investigate their metabolic contribution to acetoclastic methanogenesis am syntrophic acetate oxidation sao or hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis hm 40 anaerobic batch reactors fed with acetate of 110 mmol l were set up at nh4 n concentrations of 0 14 g l 5 00 g l or 7 00 g l inoculated with thermophilic or mesophilic microbiota with or without pre exposure to ammonia stress four stable carbon isotope probing approaches were applied in parallel with 1 2 13c ch3cooh 2 13c ch3cooh 13c nahco3 or non labeled ch3cooh used individually the last three approaches were used to quantify the methanogenic pathways by tracking labeled 13c or natural 13c signatures in the resulting ch4 and co2 and consistently detected the dynamic transition of dominant pathways from am to sao hm under ammonia stress results of quantitative pcr and fluorescence in situ hybridization illustrated the procedure acetotrophic methanogens being outcompeted by acetate oxidizing syntrophs the first and last isotope labeling approaches were designed to probe the active acetate mineralizing microbes with dna sip known acetate oxidizing bacteria like syntrophaceticus and tepidanaerobacter as well as novel members of pseudomonas bacillus and symbiobacteraceae were detected with methanoculleus as the predominant h2 co2 utilizing partner using nanosims some bacterial cells were observed to be fixing co2 from 13c nahco3 in this study methanosaeta was only active with ammonia 200 mg n l the syntrophs catalyzing sao hm started to compete with am conducting methanosarcina at intermediate concentrations

oxidizing bacteria saob and hydrogenotrophic methanogens form an essential functional guild the guild turns acetate into ch4 and co2 via two different pathways acetoclastic methanogenesis am or syntrophic acetate oxidation sao followed by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis hm saob have been found to replace acetotrophic methanogens as predominant acetate consumers under conditions including increased levels of ammonia hao et al 2017 westerholm et al 2018 elevated temperature dyksma et al 2020 ho et al 2013 or increased organic loading rates li et al 2018 lü et al 2013 which could be caused by a change in operating conditions or in the period when the reactors were starting up saob grow slowly since very limited energy is shared between the bacteria and methanogen partners in the sao hm reaction hattori 2008 westerholm et al 2019 such an adaptation of the microbiota to the changed environment usually results in performance instability or in a long lag phase dai et al 2016 in these circumstances if the predominant functional populations have changed but the digester operation is not adjusted accordingly digester performance may stay in a pseudo steady state fotidis et al 2013b with a relatively low ch4 production rate and long term process instability as sao hm catalyzers may have quite different growth features from am performers a deep understanding of this microbial adaptation procedure would then help to determine the status and to develop tailored operating strategies westerholm et al 2015 such as acclimation puig castellví et al 2020 and bioaugmentation fotidis et al 2013a westerholm et al 2012 to enhance the stability shorten the lag phase and better manage the ad process under stress conditions to this end it is crucial to identify the microbial players of the acetate mineralizing functional guild and to establish reliable links between their roles and sao hm or am pathways sao hm and the relevant functional microorganisms have been studied for two decades and found to be extensively distributed in full scale anaerobic digesters with high ammonia concentrations or in thermophilic conditions hao et al 2016 pan et al 2021 sun et al 2014 using traditional cultivation methods to date only five saob have been isolated and characterized including the mesophilic clostridium ultunense schnürer et al 1996 and syntrophaceticus schinkii westerholm et al 2010 the thermotolerant tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans westerholm et al 2011 and the thermophilic pseudothermotoga lettingae balk et al 2002 bhandari and gupta 2014 and thermacetogenium phaeum hattori et al 2000 members of methanoculleus or methanothermobacter were found to live as the h2 co2 consuming partners in co culture with these bacteria nevertheless the well studied saob are usually present at low abundance in the complex microbiota or may not even be detectable in several reactors showing a significant contribution of sao hao et al 2016 mosbæk et al 2016 puig castellví et al 2020 werner et al 2014 high throughput sequencing based techniques have been used to search for potential saob based on the relative abundance of the taxon or on the detection of functional genes like fhs in specific members dyksma et al 2020 müller et al 2013 nobu et al 2015 several attempts have also been made to enrich saob by incubation with acetate as sole source of organic carbon dyksma et al 2020 ho et al 2016 li et al 2009 wang et al 2018 werner et al 2014 westerholm et al 2018 zheng et al 2019 results indicated the involvement of diverse novel bacterial taxa thereby significantly extending the repository of proposed saob candidates however the phylogenetic relationship between these newly proposed saob candidates derived from individual studies is not yet known it is not clear whether they were widespread or were only detected in an isolated study and if they did catalyze sao since synchronous analyses of metabolic pathways and microbial populations were not carried out in some studies a detailed comparison is thus needed to better interpret the relationship between the diverse saob candidates in ad systems am is mainly catalyzed by methanogens belonging to the genera methanosaeta and methanosarcina however some members of the methanosarcina genus can use both acetate and h2 co2 as methanogenic precursors thauer et al 2008 sometimes it is difficult to clearly distinguish the metabolic type of these populations between am hm or even sao de vrieze et al 2012 dyksma et al 2020 hao et al 2015 dynamic analyses of metabolic pathways along with changes in the microbial composition can help to pinpoint the function of dominant microbial populations in a specific circumstance which could help to overcome the aforementioned problems ch4 producing pathways were quantified by tracking stable carbon isotope 13c released from the methyl carbon labeled acetate substrate which was only used ex situ in batch incubation werner et al 2014 in addition apparent 13c fractionation factor α c was used to characterize the methanogenic pathway by calculating the ratio of the natural 13c signature of co2 δ 13co2 to that of ch4 δ 13ch4 in biogas whiticar et al 1986 and thus can be applied in situ in both lab scale and full scale digesters hao et al 2016 ho et al 2014 polag et al 2015 this method is based on the observation that microbes preferentially utilize 12c during methanogenesis and hm exhibits significantly larger fractionation factors and lower δ 13ch4 than am α c 1 065 or 1 055 usually characterize predominance of hm or am conrad 2005 in the context of acetate mineralization this method can be used to study the relative contribution of acetate cleavage from am or oxidation from sao with oxidation leading to higher α c values due to stronger selection of 12c to ch4 during the followed hm activity α c is a composite parameter based on several assumptions one of which is that the co2 precursor for hm comes from the co2 carbonate system whiticar et al 1986 thus it only gives a rough estimation of the predominant pathway especially in complex environmental microbiota neverthless the efficiency of α c in distinguishing am and sao hm can be confirmed or refined with 13c labeling methods that provide the absolutely quantitative information needed to improve the methodology the aim of this study was to quantitatively investigate the dynamic change in ad microbiota with respect to both metabolic pathways and active microbial members when exposed to ammonia stress in acetate fed batch reactors the influence of temperature and acclimation on microbial behavior was studied using high and low ammonia concentrations the inoculating microbiota originated from two anaerobic reactors that were previously shown to be dominated by am under low ammonia concentrations hao et al 2015 2017 during the incubation three different stable isotope labeling approaches were applied in parallel to dynamically quantify the pathways and to compare the methods qpcr was used to record the number of major methanogenic populations and fluorescence in situ hybridization fish with confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm was used to visualize the cell morphologies and distribution dna stable isotope probing dna sip with simultaneous 13c and 15n labeling was used to track down the active microbial players which were further compared with those found in previous studies nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry nanosims was used to observe enrichment of isotope labels in microbial cells this is the first work to profile the microbial transition under stress using such integrated approaches 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculating microbiota two types of anaerobic sludge biomass were used as the source microbiota the biomasses originated from a mesophilic reactor operated at 35 c named m or a thermophilic reactor operated at 55 c named t for details see supplementary section 1 1 to prepare inocula with and without acclimation microbiota m and t were pre incubated anaerobically with nh4 n of 0 14 g l 5 00 g l for m or 7 00 g l for t in basic medium supplementary section 1 1 with 80 mmol l acetate the inocula resulting from pre incubation with 5 00 or 7 00 g n l were considered as acclimated and named ma and ta while the inocula resulting from 0 14 g n l were considered as non acclimated and named mna and tna fig 1 when methane production ceased after 32 days fig s1 the microbial solids were collected by centrifugation at 8 000 g for 5 min and used as inoculating microbiota at a concentration of 4 00 g l of volatile solids in further batch experiments 2 2 13c and 15n labeling experiment the four different inocula were then respectively incubated at low 0 14 g n l and high 5 00 g n l for m or 7 00 g n l for t concentrations of ammonium in 327 ml serum bottles fisher scientific resulting in eight sets of anaerobic batch reactors fig 1 the high nh4 n concentrations were used to initiate a shift in the predominant pathway under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions as demonstrated previously hao et al 2017 nh4cl was added as a source of ammonia stress and nitrogen for microbial growth acetic acid 110 mmol l was used as the sole source of organic carbon nahco3 140 mmol l and k2co3 20 mmol l were added to provide buffering capacity each set included five reactors r1 r5 with different carbon and nitrogen isotope labeling approaches table s1 r1 and r2 were run without any 13c or 15n labeled compounds r3 was fed with 2 13c ch3cooh 99 sigma r4 was fed with 1 2 13c ch3cooh 99 sigma r5 was fed with 50 of 13c nahco3 98 isotec and r3 r5 with 15n nh4cl 99 sigma reactors r3 and r5 were set to quantify the contribution of am or sao hm to acetate mineralization by monitoring 13c flow to ch4 and co2 in the biogas r4 was set for dna sip to track the active microbial members assimilating 13c from acetate r1 and r2 served as controls for dna sip and also to evaluate ch4 production pathways by analyzing the natural 13c signature of biogas r1 r4 and r5 were filled with respectively 73 ml and 63 ml of basic medium with addition of acetate nh4cl and bi carbonates the initial ph was adjusted to 6 5 0 1 with 1 0 mol l hcl and kept below 8 5 throughout incubation the headspace was filled with n2 gas reactors inoculated with ma and mna or ta and tna were incubated at 35 c or 55 c statically during incubation gas and liquid samples were taken periodically using syringes and stored for further analyses 2 3 ch4 production and ammonia calculation ch4 yield was calculated by monitoring the gas pressure and ch4 composition in the headspace as described previously hao et al 2017 the modified gompertz three parameter model was fitted to the cumulative ch4 yield curve of each reactor zwietering et al 1990 simulated ch4 yield and daily production rates were then predicted from the fitting curves the ph and the acetate concentration in the liquid phase were analyzed as detailed previously hao et al 2017 the concentration of free ammonia nh3 was calculated based on the ph temperature and total ammonium nh4 concentration hao et al 2015 details are provided in supplementary sections 1 2 1 4 2 4 contribution of the sao hm pathway quantified with 13c in the biogas natural 13c signatures δ 13ch4 and δ 13co2 were analyzed in reactors r1 and r2 and 13c compositions of ch4 13ch4 and co2 13co2 were analyzed in reactors r3 and r5 as detailed in supplementary section 1 2 13ch4 and 13co2 were used to calculate the percentage contribution of pathways sao hm f sao hm and am f am based on the source of carbon used to produce ch4 and co2 in the sao hm pathway acetate is oxidized to h2 and co2 the resulting h2 then reduces co2 to ch4 the co2 precursor is assumed to originate from the co3 2 hco3 co2 system conversely in the am pathway carbon in ch4 only originates from the methyl group of ch3coo therefore in reactor r3 with 2 13c ch3cooh 13ch4 is calculated as 1 δ 13 c h 4 100 f am δ 13 c o 2 f sao hm f sao hm is hence calculated as 2 f sao hm 100 δ 13 ch 4 100 δ 13 co 2 100 in reactor r5 13c nahco3 is the sole 13c source and 13ch4 can be only generated via sao hm thus 13ch4 is calculated as 3 δ 13 ch 4 δ 13 co 2 f sao hm and f sao hm is calculated as 4 f sao hm δ 13 ch 4 δ 13 co 2 100 in reactors r1 and r2 α c is calculated as follows whiticar et al 1986 5 α c δ 13 co 2 10 3 δ 13 ch 4 10 3 2 5 fish clsm and fish nanosims biomass samples were fixed for fish analysis as described previously daims et al 2005 probes eub338 arc915 mx825 ms1414 and mg1200 were used to target respectively bacteria archaea methanosaetaceae methanosarcinaceae and methanomicrobiales crocetti et al 2006 which were labeled with fluorescent dyes and the signals were observed with clsm fish nanosims was used to compare the spatial location of 13c and 15n in microbial cells with the brominated bacterial probe eub338 cell isotopic enrichment was calculated as described previously chapleur et al 2013 details are given in supplementary sections 1 5 1 6 2 6 qpcr dna sip and pyrosequencing dna was extracted from liquid aliquots sampled periodically from the reactors and used as templates for qpcr to quantify total bacteria and the different methanogen populations dna samples derived from reactors r4 and r1 or r2 with and without 13c 15n labeling were used for dna sip based on the cscl buoyant density gradient total dna was separated into heavy and light fractions that were respectively collected and used for pyrosequencing supplementary section 1 7 primer pairs 349f 806r and 28f 519r were used to target archaea and bacteria the sequences were further analyzed with qiime software and taxonomic classification of the generated otus was conducted with qiime 2 s q2 feature classifier plugin bokulich et al 2018 based on the silva ssu database version 138 1 several otus enriching 13c from acetate were selected to compare with potential saob proposed in previous studies the raw reads have been deposited in european nucleotide archive under the project prjeb44265 datas2 details are provided in supplementary sections 1 7 1 11 3 results 3 1 acetate to methane the transformation procedure differed the added acetate was consistently converted into ch4 in about 10 days in all the reactors containing nh4 n of 0 14 g l low conversion also took place in reactors with nh4 n of 5 00 g l or 7 00 g l high but progressed differently fig 2 in the case of non acclimated microbiota a first active ch4 production period was followed by an intermediate lag phase of 11 55 days with no obvious generation of ch4 after which methanogenic activity resumed tna also displayed an initial lag phase of 23 days before the first active period in the case of acclimated microbiota ma demonstated low methanogenic activity in the first period of 50 60 days after which ch4 production became quite active ta behaved slightly differently with an initial lag phase of 20 30 days followed by high methanogenic activity in the five reactors operated in parallel some variations in the recovery speed of methanogenesis were observed especially for ma 3 2 multiple isotope tracking approaches quantitatively recorded the gradual involvement of sao pathway three 13c tracking approaches were used to quantitate the contribution of sao hm pathway by tracking 13c flow into ch4 and co2 from 2 13c ch3cooh in reactor r3 or 13c nahco3 in reactor r5 or by monitoring the natural 13c signature of biogas in reactors r1 and r2 the 13c contents detected in ch4 and co2 are illustrated in fig 3 a l as can be seen in fig 3 m p f sao hm caculated from 13ch4 and 13co2 was similar in r3 and r5 when the concentration of ammonium was low ch4 was mainly produced via the am pathway with f sao hm generally 10 at high ammonium concentrations f sao hm gradully increased from 10 in the initial period to 80 100 when methanogenesis recovered from the lag phase in the later period thermophilic microbiota demonstrated higher f sao hm values 100 than mesophilic microbiota 80 90 and 13c compositions in ch4 13ch4 and co2 13co2 started to overlap fig 3 b d f h suggesting that carbon in the resulting ch4 came from a balanced co2 bicarbonate carbonate system in which equilibrium was reached between the gaseous and liquid phases α c was calculated from δ 13ch4 and δ 13co2 in r1 and r2 fig 3 q t shows that when the concentration of ammonium was low α c gradually decreased from 1 066 to 1 028 during the active ch4 producing period indicating a higher contribution of am pathway with high concentrations of ammonium α c values of non acclimated microbiota were 1 077 1 051 for tna and 1 048 1 041 for mna in the first active ch4 producing period and increased to 1 090 1 102 when methanogenesis recovered from the intermediate lag phase demonstrating that the predominant pathway shifted to sao hm the acclimated microbiota behaved differently ta displayed α c values of around 1 070 in the initial lag phase and the values increased to 1 094 when methanogenesis became quite active showing predominance of sao hm throughout ma displayed α c values that mostly fluctuated between 1 062 and 1 040 in the slow and active ch4 producing periods revealing a higher contribution of am when the competition between am and sao hm was quantified most r1 and r2 reactors showed a similar trend to that observed in r3 and r5 reactors it is confirmed that α c can be used to efficiently monitor a change in the pathway during acetate transformation into ch4 neverthless parallel ma reactors with high ammonium concentrations differed in their metabolic pathways r3 and r5 demonstrated a gradually increasing contribution of sao hm to 80 90 by contrast r1 and r2 displayed a mixture of the two pathways with am sometimes contributing more suggesting different changes in microbial composition as discussed below 3 3 visualizing the gradual development of acetate oxidizing syntrophs 16s rrna gene copy numbers of major methanogenic members and total bacteria were analyzed with qpcr including the genera methanosarcina family methanosarcinaceae and methanoculleus order methanomicrobiales the family methanosaetaceae and the order methanobacteriales figs 4 s2 the numbers of methanoculleus increased by three orders of magnitude in most reactors with high ammonium concentrations when methanogenesis recovered from the lag phase i e from the initial 103 copies ng dna to 106 copies ng dna but in ma h r4 there was a smaller increase to only 105 copies ng dna growth of methanosarcina in mesophilic microbiota differed either increasing from 102 to 106 or 105 copies ng dna in ma h r4 or ma h r5 and mna h r5 or did not change much in mna h r4 in thermophilic microbiota methanosarcina and methanosaetaceae both underwent one log fold decrease after 100 days of incubation in treatments with high ammonium concentrations however no notable change was observed for methanobacteriales which may be not active in this condition supplementary section 2 1 the appearance of methanogens and bacteria was recorded in fish images figs 5 s3 initially mesophilic and thermophilic microbiota were dominated by the rod shaped cells of methanosaetaceae and large cell aggregates of methanosarcinaceae respectively the signals emitted by these cells were gradually quenched under high ammonium concentrations and replaced by the appearance of cell clusters of bacteria and methanomicrobiales bacterial cells in mesophilic reactors were of different shapes including rods 2 5 μm in length and around 0 5 μm in width and a bamboo like cascade of short rods fig s3w in thermophilic reactors bacterial cells were longer rods 5 10 μm in length and around 0 5 μm in width these differences showed that different bacterial taxa were growing at different temperatures cells of methanomicrobiales displayed cocci with a diameter of 1 μm at both temperatures and were loosely assembled with bacterial cells cell aggregates of methanosarcinaceae of different sizes 3 20 μm in diameter appeared in most mesophilic reactors containing a high concentration of ammonium but were not observed in mna h r4 and mna h r1 fig s3 datas1 both qpcr and fish results revealed that in mesophilic reactors under ammonia stress the involvement of methanosarcinaceae to different extents could explain the different progress of recovery of methanogenesis and the diverged pathway compositions in parallel reactors we observed that when methanogenic activity recovered the abundance of either methanosarcina or methanoculleus reached a level 106 copies ng dna similar to that of the initially dominating methanosaetaceae in mesophilic microbiota or methanosarcina in thermophilic microbiota before the recovery of methanogenesis the lag phase was about 10 days shorter when large aggregates of methanosarcinaceae cells appeared datas1 suggesting the growth rate of methanosarcinaceae was higher than that of acetate oxidizing syntrophs furthermore the dominance of methanosarcinaceae members in ma h r1 r2 fig s3 was found to be in line with higher am activity in the same reactors in contrast higher abundance of methanomicrobiales cells in ma h r3 r5 figs s3 5 was accompanied by the predominance of sao hm pathway such microbial divergence phenomena have previously been observed when stress factors occurred and affected the microbiota in the reactors goux et al 2015 westerholm et al 2018 in the present study we hypothesize that ammonia stress added further stochasticity to changes in microbial community structure de vrieze et al 2020 which requires further investigation 3 4 quantification of the influence of free ammonia dynamic changes in methanogenic activities could be due to interactions between the functional microbial players and changing environmental factors as shown in fig s4a in parallel with increased methane production the ph gradually increased due to consumption of ch3coo leading to further transformation of nh4 into nh3 in mesophilic conditions the concentration of nh3 increased from 25 to 519 mg n l in reactors with a high concentration of ammonium but to less than 31 mg n l in reactors with a low concentration of ammonium in thermophilic conditions the values were 50 to 2 106 mg n l in reactors with a high concentration of ammonium and 50 mg n l in reactors with a low concentration of ammonium f sao hm which could also be considered as a percentage of inhibited am changed with the concentration of nh3 like the dose response model f sao hm started to significantly increase at an nh3 concentration of around 200 mg n l and reached 100 when the level of nh3 exceeded 500 mg n l fig s4b the change in α c with nh3 showed a similar concomitant increasing trend when the nh3 concentration was higher than 200 mg n l α c values 1 065 started to appear and when the nh3 level exceeded 500 mg l α c value increased to 1 075 likewise the number of methanoculleus displayed a 2 to 3 log fold increase when nh3 n exceeded 200 mg l like methanosarcina in some of the mesophilic reactors therefore the increasing nh3 concentration probably triggered the replacement of acetotrophic methanogens by acetate oxidizing syntrophs 3 5 involvement of diverse bacterial and archaeal members identified via dna sip to identify microorganisms that actively assimilate acetate the microbiota was incubated with 1 2 13c ch3cooh and 15n nh4cl or unlabeled compounds total dna was extracted from samples taken when methanogenesis actively recovered from inhibition and was further separated into different fractions based on buoyant density fig s5 as detailed in supplementary section 2 2 dna fractions enriched with 13c and 15n were clearly separated from fractions without thereby guaranteeing isolation of metabolic active microorganisms bacteria and archaea compositions were analyzed in both heavy and light dna fractions that represent active and inert microbial consortia respectively fig 6 a b shows that in thermophilic microbiota bacterial members of the genus syntrophaceticus otus 213 281 128 164 294 the genus bacillus otus 296 609 and archaeal members of the genus methanoculleus otus 77 0 36 35 19 were much more abundant mostly tenfold higher in the heavy dna than in the light suggesting syntrophism between syntrophaceticus and or bacillus with methanoculleus by contrast in mesophilic microbiota bacterial taxa other than syntrophaceticus were significantly enriched in 13c and 15n including members of the genus pseudomonas otu 292 the genus bacillus otu 296 and the family symbiobacteraceae otus 421 40 additionally various archaeal members of the genus methanoculleus otus 77 39 41 2 0 36 35 19 rumen m2 otu 2 also named methanomassiliicoccales archaeon rumen m2 and the genus methanosarcina otu 81 were more abundant in heavy dna indicating involvement of diverse bacterial and archaeal taxa in acetate mineralization in addition to temperature acclimation was shown to have some influence on the composition of active microbial communities for instance the otus of syntrophaceticus that dominated in tna h r4 and ta h r4 were not the same uncultured symbiobacteraceae mainly appeared in mna h r4 but not in ma h r4 while methanosarcina otu81 was detected in ma h r4 but not in mna h r4 as also observed with qpcr and fish analyses these otus represented the predominant active microbial players relative abundance 1 among them only the five otus of the genus syntrophaceticus detected in thermophilic microbiota shared 95 96 similarity with s schinkii and none of the others exactly matched the well studied saob further investigation of the less abundant otus 1 detected t acetatoxydans in the heavy dna from tna otu18 relative abundance 0 3 otu107 and otu542 of the genus tepidanaerobacter both increased tenfold in the heavy dna compared with in the light dna from tna 0 05 to 0 49 and ma 0 1 to 0 9 respectively fig 6 c datas2 members of genera alkaliphilus and dtu014 have already been described as potential saob as they encode genes that are essential for sao and were found to be highly abundant in high ammonia anaerobic digesters dyksma et al 2020 mosbæk et al 2016 müller et al 2016 in the present study otu532 of the genus alkaliphilus increased markedly in the heavy dna compared with in the light dna from mna 0 03 to 0 36 and ta 0 to 0 15 and three otus of dtu014 otus35 83 563 mainly appeared in the heavy dna from tna 0 56 these otus can be considered as relatives of known or candidate saob their appearance at such low abundance probably cannot explain all the sao activities especially in mna where sao hm contributed 90 to methane production in the late period the role of symbiobacteraceae members that prevailed in this condition was thus highlighted supplementary section 2 3 3 6 evidence for co2 fixing bacteria provided by nanosims various novel bacterial taxa were found to be involved in acetate mineralization possibly assimilating acetate or the resulting metabolites like formate and co2 to check whether co2 could be one of the carbon sources the microbiota incubated with 13c nahco3 was sampled after 81 days and analyzed using nanosims figs 7 and s10 show rod shape bacterial cells enriched in 13c and 15n at maximum values of 7 0 and 91 0 respectively values that were 8 0 and 91 0 for the adjacent spherical cells of methanomicrobiales these 13c enrichment values in the biomass were similar to the values of 13co2 8 9 and 13ch4 8 1 at the time evidence that some bacteria were actively fixing inorganic carbon while using nh4 n as nitrogen source for growth 4 discussion 4 1 multiple isotope tracking approaches can quantify acetate mineralizing pathways in this study for the first time four different 13c and 15n labeling approaches were applied in parallel and quantitatively tracked both the metabolic pathways and the active microbial players during acetate conversion into ch4 our results show that using 2 13c ch3cooh and 13c nahco3 led to the same conclusion when acetate was thoroughly converted via the sao hm pathway 13ch4 values started to overlap with 13co2 indicating that co2 the hm precursor was derived from the balanced co2 bicarbonate carbonate system therefore analyzing the 13c flow from 13c labeled carbonate bicarbonate is a viable alternative method to accurately quantify the contribution of sao pathway to acetate conversion especially when considerable amounts of residual acetate exist in the target system that could dilute the added 13c labeled acetate results obtained using natural 13c fractionation generally demonstrated a similar trend to that using 13c labeling approaches we observed differences between αc values derived from am 1 000 and sao hm 1 102 as high as 0 102 enabling us to clearly monitor the gradual change in the methanogenic pathways using the natural 13c signature it should be noted that a gradual decrease in αc value within a narrow range was observed alongside a rapid degradation in acetate at relatively low concentrations of ammonia but this might not be a sign of increasing am contribution as f sao hm remained stable at low values 10 as meaured by the isotope labeling methods used in parallel this decrease may be related to the change in the isotopic composition of the remaining acetate pool which became increasingly enriched in 13c during the conversion process meaning this result should be intepreted with caution 4 2 appearance of novel bacterial and archaeal members in acetate enrichments 4 2 1 novel bacterial taxa acetate fed batch incubation with high concentrations of ammonia enriched diverse bacterial and archaeal taxa that mineralized acetate mostly via the sao hm pathway the thermophilic microbiota was dominated by various taxa of syntrophaceticus and methanoculleus the two most commonly found genera forming acetate oxidizing syntrophs in high ammonia ad but in mesophilic microbiota the known saob or reported candidates only accounted for 3 of enriched bacterial communities instead novel members of pseudomonas bacillus and uncultured symbiobacteraceae which have not yet been shown to possess sao capability were found to be actively involved however such observations have been reported in previous studies we thus compared the novel microbial taxa found in our work and in four other acetate enrichment experiments performed individually supplementary sections 1 8 1 9 results show that members of these genera were also abundant in other acetate enrichments for instance pseudomonas was enriched with acetate in batch incubation dyksma et al 2020 li et al 2009 werner et al 2014 or chemostat westerholm et al 2018 from microbiota that originated from thermophilic or mesophilic digesters treating various organic wastes with nh4 n ranging from 0 26 g l to 5 00 g l nine relevant otus were selected from the five studies the abundance of which was mostly 1 in the microbial communities their representative sequences shared from 88 9 to 99 6 similarity and were assigned to the genera pseudomonas and thiopseudomonas both belonging to the family pseudomonadaceae datas3 these results suggest that various pseudomonas members and close relatives are widespread in ad and can be enriched with acetate therein the four representative sequences 1 000 bp in length were most closely related to pseudomonas sp m 08 ab567742 and pseudomonas sp hy 14 eu620679 2 with 97 similarity fig s8 both closest relatives were denitrifying bacteria isolated from activated or anaerobic sludge rich in ammonia xiao et al 2009 it is not sure if they are involved in the nitrogen cycle like anaerobic ammonium oxidation as no nitrate nitrite was initially added in our study members of uncultured symbiobacteraceae and bacillus were also abundantly detected in studies by westerholm et al 2018 and dyksma et al 2020 typical symbiobacteraceae species were described to be anaerobic chemo organotrophic bacteria utilizing sugars with nitrate as electron acceptor or peptone alone shiratori takano et al 2014 in our study symbiobacteraceae and methanoculleus members were found to be absolutely predominant in a microbiota actively catalyzing sao hm and no other known saob were detected these symbiobacteraceae members were thus most probably directly involved in sao activity and were newly identified saob in our work members of bacillus infernus otu609 were only found in thermophilic conditions fig s7 as also reported in the study by westerholm et al 2018 as described previously members of this species can make respiratory use of formate with electron donors like mno2 fe3 and nitrate boone et al 1995 in mesophilic microbiota other bacillus members otu296 different from that of bacillus infernus were found 4 2 2 co2 fixation by bacteria even though diverse bacterial members were enriched in isotope labeled dna the actual carbon source and energy metabolism of the novel members still could not be determined some of the bacterial cells were observed to be growing and assimilating co2 in ma h r5 with 13c nahco3 like the hydrogenotrophic methanogens bacterial co2 fixation is not rare bacillus subtilis w23 was previously reported to incorporate 5 to 6 of 13co2 into microbial biomass during heterotrophic growth reflecting biomass formation involving anaplerotic carboxylation of pyruvate spona friedl et al 2020 likewise symbiobacterium thermophilum watsuji et al 2006 and bacillus anthracis eastin and thorne 1963 were shown to be able to fix external co2 and pseudomonas members have ever been detected in co2 enrichments jeon et al 2012 therefore except for sao metabolism co2 fixation could be one of the ways that make some novel bacterial taxa appear in heavy dna via some as yet unidentified catabolic or anabolic pathways this result shows that dna sip only using 13c labeled acetate cannot fully distinguish the metabolic functions of all the microbial members probed during acetate mineralization to solve this problem further investigation is needed by incubation with a series of labeled substrates including acetate formate and carbonates or by using meta omics approaches to identify the active pathways even though 13c labeled carbonate was used in the present study unfortunately only samples from 13c labeled acetate were preserved for dna sip analysis so we missed the opportunity to distinguish microorganisms assimilating acetate or carbonate co2 4 2 3 diverse methanogens involved all the 19 otus of methanoculleus were enriched in heavy dna indicating active h2 co2 driven methanogenic activities in the reactors tested especially in mna h r4 ta h r4 and tna h r4 methanoculleus contributed to 78 of the archaeal sequences derived from heavy dna growth of the predominant methanoculleus members in these reactors was consistently observed with qpcr and fish supplementary section 2 4 evidence for their prominent role in mineralizing acetate as h2 co2 utilizers these otus shared 93 to 99 similarity with methanoculleus bourgensis a common partner of saob westerholm et al 2019 2012 2011 2010 acetotrophic methanosaeta also appeared in heavy dna but in smaller quantities than in light dna in fish images the cells were observed in the initial slow methane producing period otu68 close to methanosarcina thermophila and otu81 distantly related to known methanosarcina species fig s9 were detected in thermophilic and mesophilic microbiota respectively in fish images the former was only observed at the beginning of incubation in thermophilic reactors while the latter was observed when methanogenic activities recovered from the lag phase in most mesophilic reactors these methanosaeta and methanosarcina members are hypothesized to be responsible for the am activities that occurred in the initial period of incubation or co occurred with sao hm in the recovery period in mesophilic conditions methanomassiliicoccales archaeon rumen m2 a methylotrophic population was surprisingly enriched in heavy dna which has also been reported in mesophilic acetate fed chemostats westerholm et al 2018 in the metagenome assembled genome of rumen m2 the acetyl coa synthetase gene was identified which can catalyze conversion of acetate to acetyl coa rumen m2 members were thus hypothesized to be able to grow heterotrophically on acetate söllinger et al 2016 in our study they might have been using acetate as a carbon source and were consequently probed with isotopes 4 3 pre acclimation accelerated the appearance of stress tolerant microbial players in this work the microbiota was considered to be acclimated by pre exposure to ammonia stress for a 32 day period before being used as inoculum while the non acclimated were not subjected to a pre attack of ammonia stress the acclimated microbiota developed stress tolerant microbial populations faster and methanogenic activities were recovered more rapidly after the lag phase which was 18 46 days shorter than that of the non acclimated microbiota datas1 the active microbial members were however more concentrated in a few otus showed less diversity and evenness than that of non acclimated members these differences were attributed to the impaired activity of the acetotrophic methanogens during pre exposure to ammonia stress when they were the major acetate consumers fig s1 this injury not only slowed down the am reaction in the initial period of the batch tests but also hindered the increase in ph and in the concentration of nh3 due to consumption of ch3coo this provided a relatively stable and less stressful environment for the growth of ammonia tolerant microorganisms like methanosarcina or saob coupled with methanoculleus such populations probably already started to grow during the acclimation period and were added to the batch incubation as seeds but the number of these newly grown seeds must have been very low as no significant difference was observed between acclimated and non acclimated inocula with qpcr probably because acetate in pre incubation was mostly converted by the original predator via the am pathway 4 4 am catalyzing methanosarcina tolerant to medium ammonia stress methanosarcina was repeatedly seen to be active in ad with a medium concentration of ammonia 100 500 mg n l dai et al 2016 de vrieze et al 2012 fotidis et al 2013b hao et al 2015 however it is still not clear which metabolism they catalyze since some of the members can use both acetate and h2 co2 for methanogenesis or even use the electrons directly rotaru et al 2018 in this study methanosarcina cell aggregates appeared in most mesophilic reactors when the concentration of ammonia increased to 200 500 mg n l at the same time methanosaetaceae members were not observed with fish clsm suggesting these members may have become inactive methanosarcina is thus hypothesized to be responsible for the concomitant am activity that contributed 10 to methane production in thermophilic reactors methanosarcina was observed initially when the am pathway predominated but was gradually outcompeted by the hydrogenotrophic methanoculleus when the concentration of ammonia exceeded 500 mg n l therefore methanosarcina mainly catalyzed am at low 200 mg n l to medium concentrations 200 500 mg n l of ammonia generally as can be seen from our results am demonstrated higher reaction rates than sao hm these results indicate that under medium ammonia stress growth of am conducting methanosarcina led to faster consumption of acetate which could be more efficient than the growth of acetate oxidizing syntrophs to optimize digester performance 5 conclusions this work provided deep insights into the acetate metabolizing microbial communities by deciphering the roles of various microbial populations during the transition of metabolism from am to sao hm induced by increasing ammonia stress the dynamic changes in microbial members and functions were monitored by qpcr fish and high throughput sequencing with four isotope tracking approaches solid evidence is provided for syntrophic interactions between syntrophaceticus and methanoculleus as prominent saob and hydrogenotrophic partners under high nh3 stress 500 2100 mg n l am conducting methanosarcina was shown to compete with saob under intermediate levels of nh3 stress 200 430 mg n l and novel bacterial members were shown to be involved the role of uncultured symbiobacteriaceae members as saob was pinpointed in particular bacterial co2 fixation was observed with nanosims indicating competition between autotrophic bacteria and archaea further labeled isotope probing and natural isotope signature approaches were shown to generate highly consistent results in quantifying the am and sao hm pathways the combined application of isotopic techniques with complementary molecular biology methods in this work provides a methodological

total effluent cod graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr domestic wastewater treatment cod removal energy balance operating expenses opex membrane fouling 1 introduction great efforts are currently underway worldwide to reduce fossil fuel usage and to increase use of renewable sources of energy in response to the adverse impacts of fossil fuel usage on climate change in the wastewater treatment sector the major energy usage is the aeration required for operation of aerobic biological treatment systems an alternative is anaerobic treatment which can produce renewable energy in the form of methane gas while greatly reducing production of waste organic solids and their costly treatment and disposal mccarty et al 2011 indeed numerous full scale anaerobic systems are used for treatment of concentrated waste streams such as domestic biosolids and industrial wastewaters and even for treatment of low strength streams such as domestic wastewater when ambient temperatures are sufficiently high or when a high efficiency of treatment is not required rittmann and mccarty 2020 in recent years pilot scale anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs have been evaluated for their potential to efficiently treat domestic wastewaters in temperate climates shin and bae 2018 a report by evans et al 2019 described comparative treatment results for two anmbrs treating domestic wastewater one is a common design an anaerobic completely stirred tank reactor followed by anmbr cstr anmbr this system relies upon dispersed growth plus use of gas sparged ultrafiltration membranes for removal of biosolids from the system effluent permeate as well as to maintain high levels of biosolids in the treatment reactor the second is a staged anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor saf mbr that includes an anaerobic fluidized bed reactor afbr in the first stage and ultrafiltration membranes in the second stage in the afbr fluidized granular activated carbon gac particles were used to harbor methanogenic communities that convert biodegradable cod into methane in a first version of the saf mbr membrane fouling control was achieved by allowing fluidized gac particles to scour the membranes both the cstr anmbr and the saf mbr systems achieved cod removal efficiencies comparable to that of activated sludge however both had difficulties that deserve further research for improvement the cstr anmbr required a much longer detention time in order to hold sufficient microorganisms and meet the needed high solids retention time srt for efficient anaerobic treatment in addition the high concentration of dispersed growth increased rates of membrane fouling and reduced membrane flux both increased the membrane area required and the energy needed to control membrane fouling the saf mbr operated efficiently at short detention times that were comparable to or better than those of typical aerobic treatment systems but while gac worked well for cleaning of membranes that approach was too harsh and caused substantial membrane damage shin et al 2016a evans et al 2019 the major conclusion from the evans et al 2019 report was to better capture the relative advantages of each system a hybrid anmbr comprised of a gac fluidized bioreactor connected to a separate gas sparged ultrafiltration membrane system is proposed this will likely be more effective efficient robust resilient and cost effective we have now designed fabricated and operated the hybrid second generation system they proposed referring to it as the saf mbr 2 0 to our knowledge this is the first report of net energy positive operation achieved by a pilot scale anmbr 2 methods and materials 2 1 system configuration a pilot scale system consisting of a microscreen for primary treatment followed by a saf mbr 2 0 for secondary treatment was constructed at the codiga resource recovery center stanford ca as illustrated in fig 1 primary treatment was achieved by pumping raw domestic wastewater through a grit removal system followed by a microscreen ms 28 hydro international screen pore size 300 µm this screened effluent served as influent to saf mbr 2 0 which consisted of three reactors afbr 1 1 0 m3 798 kg gac afbr 2 1 8 m3 1230 kg gac and a gas sparged anmbr 1 7 m3 the afbrs used fluidized gac filtrasorb 300 calgon carbon as a biocarrier originally afbr 2 was designed and operated as a particle sparged anmbr but because of flow rate limitations the particle sparged anmbr was converted to a second afbr afbrs 1 and 2 were operated in parallel with external recirculation connecting them to initiate operation both reactors were seeded with active methanogenic biomass from an upflow anerobic sludge blanket uasb treating winery wastewater e j gallo winery fresno ca the pilot system then treated stanford domestic wastewater for more than three years prior to this study constant upflow velocities were maintained at 43 8 m h for afbr 1 and at 27 1 m h for afbr 2 a recirculation pump connected afbr 2 to afbr 1 membrane retained solids mrs from the anmbr were recirculated throughout the system via a second recirculation loop connected to afbr 1 enabling further hydrolysis of degradable suspended solids both recycled flows were twice the influent flow rate in order to maintain consistent mlss concentrations in all three reactors the solids retention time srt for the system was controlled by continuously wasting mrs with a peristaltic pump pu 77916 10 masterflex at a rate of 1 of influent flow the gas sparged anmbr was outfitted with three submersible membrane modules zeeweed 500d suez containing ultrafiltration membranes nominal pore size 0 04 µm and with two leapmbr diffusers suez that provided biogas sparging of the membranes for fouling control only two of the three membrane modules were used to simulate high flux conditions 12 l m2 h while maintaining the hrt minimum of 5 h membrane fouling was controlled with four measures 1 continuous ten minute cycling with an 8 min permeate pumping period pump on followed by a 2 min relaxation period pump off 2 use of two leapmbr diffusers that provided

consisted of two sequences of chemically enhanced backwashing ceb the first sequence used a 500 mg l sodium hypochlorite solution the second used a 2000 mg l citric acid solution each mc sequence began with a 2 min initial ceb pulse followed by four 30 s ceb pulses at a flux of 20 l m2 h each separated by a membrane relaxation period of 4 5 min rc was conducted when the trans membrane pressure tmp reached an upper limit set point 0 4 bar during rc the membrane tank was filled with an 1100 mg l sodium hypochlorite solution soaking the membranes in the solution for 24 h to eliminate organic foulant deposits the tank was then flushed and filled with a citric acid solution tank concentration of 2200 mg l and the membranes were soaked for another 24 h to remove inorganic foulants table 1

detector gc tcd series 580 gow mac bethlehem pa and an autosampler raw wastewater and saf mbr 2 0 influent and effluent permeate were collected using composite samplers 5800 refrigerated sampler teledyne isco at each process stage 500 ml samples were collected every 30 min and then composited by mixing in a container prior to analysis grab samples were collected for mrs as its concentrations

developed for each operational period energy inputs computed as per shin and bae 2018 included 1 pumping energy for gac fluidization in the afbrs 2 pumping energy for external recirculation among the three reactors 3 pumping suction energy for permeate production and 4 gas compression energy for membrane gas sparging energy outputs included 1 computed energy from combustion of the recovered biogas

efficiencies for gas blowers and combined heat and power chp were modified with updated data a chp electrical conversion efficiency of 38 lang et al 2017 and a blower energy efficiency of 65 lim et al 2019 were assumed more detailed information on energy calculations is provided in the supporting information some influent biodegradable colloidal cod was found to be smaller than the pore size of the submerged membranes 40 nm we refer to this fraction as ultrafine cod ufcod due to its small size ufcod can pass throught the membranes limiting the efficacy of membrane based size exclusion as a mechanism for its removal to investigate this finding we compared several characteristics of the influent ufcod with those of the permeate influent ufcod samples were obtained by filtering microscreen effluent i e saf mbr 2 0 influent through membrane filter paper 110 603 whatman with a pore size similar to that of the anmbr membranes then analyzed for cod a dynamic light scattering dls nanoparticle analyzer brookhaven instrument nanobrook omni was also used to measure nanometer scale particle size distributions in the influent ufcod in addition ufcod hydrolysis rates were obtained using a set of parallel biochemical methane potential bmp batch tests in which bmp vials were seeded with saf mbr 2 0 gac 18 75 g along with one of several substrates glucose acetate propionate or saf mbr 2 0 influent ufcod these data were analyzed as part of a companion modeling study shin et al 2021 3 results 3 1 cod removal table 2 contains summaries of cod concentrations and removal efficiencies for the overall system microscreen saf mbr 2 0 and for the saf mbr 2 0 alone during each operational period the lowest overall cod removal was 87 this value was observed during the period with the shortest hrt and lowest temperature period iiib saf mbr 2 0 cod removal was a function of hrt and temperature varying from 84 at a 10 h hrt to 83 at a 7 h hrt in period ii with further decreases in period iii at an hrt of 5 3 h 79 in period iiia with 20 c temperature conditions and 78 in period iiib with 20 c temperature conditions these cod removal efficiencies were low compared with results from other pilot scale anmbr studies 87 shin and bae 2018 3 2 cod mass balance fig 2 illustrates cod mass balances for periods ii iiia and iiib the fraction of cod used by sulfate reducing bacteria was no greater than about 0 5 mg l because of low influent sulfate 5 mgso4 2 l during period ii about 31 of the saf mbr 2 0 influent cod exited the system as permeate and as wasted mrs during period iiia with shorter hrt this fraction increased to 37 and then with lower temperature during period iiib it increased more to 42 during period iiib equipment malfunctions negatively affected methane gas measurements resulting in an underestimate of gaseous methane 3 3 net positive energy an energy balance was constructed for the saf mbr 2 0 pilot system comparing the energy for operation with the potential energy that could be obtained from the produced methane fig 3 data for period iiib was not used here because of the equipment caused gas measurement errors because the power required for system operation kw was constant the required energy per cubic meter of flow kwh m3 varied with flux as illustrated in fig 3 energy requirements for the saf mbr 2 0 ranged from 0 28 to 0 53 kwh m3 gas sparging represented the largest fraction comprising 70 of total energy demand as others have found crone et al 2016 the energy required for recovery of dissolved methane using degassing membranes is less than 0 01 kwh m3 much less than the energy required for gas sparging and fluidization assuming 90 recovery of dissolved methane crone et al 2016 mean energy production from all methane sources gaseous and dissolved for periods ii and iiia was 1 03 kwh m3 typically the energy conversion efficiency from combined heat and power chp is 38 lang et al 2017 so that the electrical energy produced would be 0 39 kwh m3 a value that exceeds the energy demand of 0 28 kwh m3 at a flux of 12 2 l m2 h by 0 11 kwh m3 the above analysis however does not include energy demands for preliminary and primary treatment nor of that produced from anaerobic digestion of primary microscreened material the additional energy demands longo et al 2016 include influent pumps 0 04 kwh m3 grit removal 0 007 kwh m3 and microscreen filtration 0 01 0 02 kwh m3 these additional demands total 0 06 0 07 kwh m3 at the high end on the positive side additional electrical energy 0 12 kwh m3 about one third of electrical energy produced from the secondary treatment mccarty et al 2011 would be generated from combustion of biogas produced by anaerobic digestion of the primary solids this additional net energy production represents about 0 05 0 06 kwh m3 which when combined with the net increase of 0 11 kwh m3 from secondary treatment gives a net energy production of 0 16 0 17 kwh m3 at the optimal net membrane flux of 12 2 l m2 h 3 4 removal of suspended solids and production of biosolids suspended solids in the influent permeate and wasted mrs were monitored to quantify suspended solids removal and biosolids production for each operational period as summarized in tables 3 and 4 the efficiency of suspended solids removal by membrane filtration was stable at 99 1 and was unaffected by other operational conditions table 4 contains a summary of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss for operational periods periods ii through iiib without srt upsets as expected the vss for disposal active biomass plus unhydrolyzed vss per unit of cod removed increased from 0 08 to 0 13 mgvss mgcodremoved likely due to less hydrolysis at lower srt and lower temperatures in a future full scale implementation wasted mrs containing appreciable cod due to operation at low srt or at low temperature could be thickened and stabilized in an anaerobic digester enabling additional energy recovery 3 5 membrane fouling and control measures fig 4 illustrates changes in net flux and tmp together with temperature and chemical cleaning conditions and table 5 contains related values for the rate of change in membrane permeability l m2 h bar day these latter value dk20 dt are corrected for temperature effects on viscosity by adjusting to the reference permeability at 20 c shin et al 2016b during period 1 tmp was stable at a flux of 6 5 l m2 h without any significant increase during period ii tmp increased due to the higher flux 9 4 l m2 h to mitigate fouling the first recovery cleaning rc was carried out on day 136 and tmp recovered to levels comparable to the original tmp during period iiia 12 3 l m2 h membrane fouling rates increased rapidly and the permeability change rate dropped to 2 6 l m2 h bar day table 5 accordingly on day 164 the mc frequency was increased from once every two weeks to once every week this increase effectively decreased the fouling rate to a value close to that of period ii during period iiib however weekly membrane cleaning was insufficient to control the increased rate of fouling as temperatures dropped below 20 c accordingly a second rc was carried out on day 274 and the mc frequency was increased to twice weekly increased chemical cleaning frequencies enabled flux values to reach 12 l m2 h evans et al 2018 reported that a pilot scale cstr anmbr operating at mc and rc cycles similar to those used in this work and treating similar strength wastewater were subject to higher rates of membrane fouling at a flux of 10 l m2 h and required more intensive gas sparging the lower membrane fouling rates in the saf mbr 2 0 were likely due to the much lower mrs in contact with the ultrafiltration membranes robles et al 2013 the saf mbr 2 0 incorporating attached growth gac biocarrier within afbr maintained mlss 6000 mg l at 6 h hrt with even lower values at 20 c while the cstr anmbr had mlss 10 000 mg l at 10 h hrt evans et al 2018 3 6 high permeate cod traced to biodegradable ufcod permeate cod during all operational periods was unexpectedly high with concentrations 84 mg l table 2 exceeding the united states cod secondary effluent standard of 60 mg l lim et al 2019 several possible explanations for this high permeate cod were investigated beginning with the possibility of membrane damage permeate grab samples from two sampling events were filtered through a laboratory scale ultrafiltration module prepared with 0 03 µm nominal pore size membranes samsung sdi and analyzed in triplicate there was no statistical difference between the permeate cods measured before and after filtration mrs filtered through a laboratory scale ultrafiltration module had the same cod as pilot scale permeate laboratory scale ultrafiltration modules with fresh membranes did not enhance cod removal illustrating that the submerged membranes were intact and functional another possible explanation for the high permeate cod was the presence of influent refractory cod accordingly bmp tests were used to assess the biodegradability of permeate cod shin et al 2021 the measured and predicted volumes of methane calculated from the permeate cod were in good agreement indicating that the permeate was fully biodegradable because acetate and propionate are major intermediates in methanogenesis permeate samples were also analyzed by ion chromatography neither acetate nor propionate concentrations were above the detection limits for any operational period even in permeate collected at low temperature to explore the possibility that permeate cod originated from influent colloidal organics we measured particle size distributions for the influent ufcod on a dls nanoparticle analyzer finding that the size of the influent ufcod ranged between 18 and 33 nm fig s1 smaller than the nominal ultrafiltration membrane pore size 40 nm further studies demonstrated that influent ufcod is susceptible to hydrolysis as it passes through ultrafiltration membranes its hydrolysis would be governed by hrt not srt in a companion modeling study shin et al 2021 hydrolysis rates of influent ufcod k h y d u f were independently determined these values were used to predict the permeate cod at steady state for each operational period the predictions matched measured values fig 5 implying that unhydrolyzed influent ufcod was likely the dominant contributor to permeate cod 4 discussion 4 1 optimization of energy and chemical demands for membrane cleaning this research underscores the trade off between energy demand for system operation largely due to fluidization and membrane sparging verses chemical demands for membrane fouling control because power input to the pumps and blower was maintained constant higher flux operation decreased energy demand but increased membrane fouling rates fouling rates can be controlled by implementation of an appropriate mc strategy section 3 5 fig 6 illustrates estimated values for opex m3 over different periods of operation including flux energy requirements mc frequency rc interval and membrane fouling rate dk20 dt energy costs were calculated from the energy demand kwh m3 excluding energy from produced methane unit prices of energy and chemicals were 0 1 kwh 279 m3 for 14 naocl solution and 835 m3 for 50 citric acid solution verrecht et al 2010 unit prices for mc and rc were 0 3 and 10 6 per cleaning event the rc interval t r c was determined from the membrane fouling rate dk20 dt l m2 h bar d according to eqs 1 and 2 1 k 20 m i n j 20 t m p m a x 2 t r c k 20 m i n k 20 0 d k 20 d t where j 20 is a normalized flux at 20 c shin et al 2016b and t m p m a x is the maximum tmp setpoint 0 4 bar the k 20 m i n is the minimum permeability for a given flux which are 16 3 23 5 and 31 3 l m2 h bar at 6 5 9 4 and 12 3 l m2 h flux conditions respectively k 20 0 is the initial permeability 90 l m2 h bar energy costs shaded blue fractions fig 6 are the largest contributor to opex greatly exceeding chemical costs for membrane cleaning and are driven by membrane flux opex were highest for the lowest flux case of 6 5 l m2 h even though chemical cleaning requirements green and orange fractions were minimal for operation at higher flux proper selection of mc frequency became critical at a flux of 9 4 l m2 h opex dropped by 21 due to increased flux but a further increase in flux to 12 3 l m2 h led to greatly increased fouling rates and larger opex because of shorter rc intervals 23 days as oppose to 180 days which are more costly than mc cleanings increasing mc frequency from once every two weeks column 3 to once per week column 4 and rc interval from 23 days to 292 days minimized mc and rc costs for the 12 3 l m2 h case enabling low opex at temperatures 20 c column 4 for temperatures 20 c operation under the same conditions i e flux of 12 2 l m2 h with once weekly cleaning led to increased rates of membrane fouling column 5 this was addressed by increasing mc frequency to twice weekly and decreasing the rc interval to 151 days the net effect of these changes was a decrease in opex taken together these operational results underscore the importance of flux conditions and their impacts on energy demand also critical is the mc frequency and its impact on the interval required for more costly rc measures 4 2 ufcod effects and management the high permeate cod observed in this study was unlike values obtained in previous pilot scale studies of the saf mbr 1 0 shin et al 2014 where effluent cod did not exceed 30 mg l this result may in part be explained by the more dilute influent cod of 270 mg l in the earlier study shin et al 2014 compared to the relatively high influent cod of 520 mg l in the present study if we assume that doubling of the influent cod results in a doubling of permeate cod then the expected permeate cod for the pilot scale saf mbr 2 0 would be 60 mg l but measured values were far greater 120 mg l one possible explanation for the high permeate cod concentration is an unusually high ufcod fraction 30 in the influent perhaps because the wastewater diverted from the stanford serra street sewer contained relatively fresh sewage and was subject to little hydrolysis prior to its collection other researchers have reported percentages of sub micron colloid cod for domestic wastewaters ranging from 9 to 15 levine et al 1991 in one study rickert and hunter 1971 the fraction of influent cod attributed to ufcod colloidal organic matter was just 8 of the influent cod most pilot scale anmbr studies to date evans et al 2018 summarized in shin and bae 2018 have likely had similar ufcod fractions i e close to 10 due to size exclusion the anmbr can thus achieve 90 cod removal efficiency at any hrt depending upon membrane pore size however for cases with a high ufcod fraction like those of the present study provisions need to be made for reduction of ufcod in the influent or elsewhere sufficient hrt for ufcod hydrolysis or modification of membranes by increasing bioreactor volume hrt could be increased while maintaining the same flux and membrane surface area without any significant increase in energy demand for membrane fouling control however for influent ufcod 150 mg l the hrt requirement could be 18 h to meet a secondary standard of 60 mg l at 20 c this hrt is excessive for secondary treatment not only is ufcod a regulatory concern and a source of lost methane it is also a critical membrane foulant it can plug membrane pores making it difficult to control clogging by gas sparging or membrane scouring measures that are more effective for removal of cake layer foulants the negative impacts of ufcod on membrane permeate cod and fouling rates may differ for aerobic mbrs where biological processes promote flocculation and coagulation rickert and hunter 1971 and hydrolysis rates may be more accelerated teo and wong 2014 4 3 needs for future study saf mbr 2 0 achieved net energy positive operation while treating influent containing 500 mgcod l for more dilute influent energy production

16639,conventional aerobic secondary treatment of domestic wastewater is energy intensive here we report net energy positive operation of a pilot scale anaerobic secondary treatment system in a temperate climate with low levels of volatile solids for disposal 0 15 mgvss mgcodremoved and hydraulic residence times as low as 5 3 h this was accomplished with a second generation staged anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor saf mbr 2 0 consisting of a first stage anaerobic fluidized bed reactor afbr followed by a second stage gas sparged anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr in stage 1 fluidized granular activated carbon gac particles harbor methanogenic communities that convert soluble biodegradable cod into methane in stage 2 submerged membranes produce system effluent permeate and retain particulate cod that can be hydrolyzed and or recycled back to stage 1 for conversion to methane an energy balance on saf mbr 2 0 excluding energy from anaerobic digestion of primary suspended solids indicated net energy positive operation 0 11 kwh m3 with energy recovery from produced methane 0 39 kwh electricity m3 0 64 kwh heat m3 exceeding energy consumption due to gac fluidization 0 07 kwh electricity m3 and gas sparging 0 20 kwh electricity m3 at an optimal flux of 12 2 l m2 h two factors dominated the operating expenses energy requirements and recovery cleaning frequency these factors were in turn affected by flux conditions membrane fouling rate and temperature for optimization of expenses the frequency of low cost maintenance cleanings was adjusted to minimize recovery cleanings while maintaining optimal flux with low energy costs an issue still to be resolved is the occurrence of ultrafine cod in membrane permeate that accounted for much of the total effluent cod graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr domestic wastewater treatment cod removal energy balance operating expenses opex membrane fouling 1 introduction great efforts are currently underway worldwide to reduce fossil fuel usage and to increase use of renewable sources of energy in response to the adverse impacts of fossil fuel usage on climate change in the wastewater treatment sector the major energy usage is the aeration required for operation of aerobic biological treatment systems an alternative is anaerobic treatment which can produce renewable energy in the form of methane gas while greatly reducing production of waste organic solids and their costly treatment and disposal mccarty et al 2011 indeed numerous full scale anaerobic systems are used for treatment of concentrated waste streams such as domestic biosolids and industrial wastewaters and even for treatment of low strength streams such as domestic wastewater when ambient temperatures are sufficiently high or when a high efficiency of treatment is not required rittmann and mccarty 2020 in recent years pilot scale anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs have been evaluated for their potential to efficiently treat domestic wastewaters in temperate climates shin and bae 2018 a report by evans et al 2019 described comparative treatment results for two anmbrs treating domestic wastewater one is a common design an anaerobic completely stirred tank reactor followed by anmbr cstr anmbr this system relies upon dispersed growth plus use of gas sparged ultrafiltration membranes for removal of biosolids from the system effluent permeate as well as to maintain high levels of biosolids in the treatment reactor the second is a staged anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor saf mbr that includes an anaerobic fluidized bed reactor afbr in the first stage and ultrafiltration membranes in the second stage in the afbr fluidized granular activated carbon gac particles were used to harbor methanogenic communities that convert biodegradable cod into methane in a first version of the saf mbr membrane fouling control was achieved by allowing fluidized gac particles to scour the membranes both the cstr anmbr and the saf mbr systems achieved cod removal efficiencies comparable to that of activated sludge however both had difficulties that deserve further research for improvement the cstr anmbr required a much longer detention time in order to hold sufficient microorganisms and meet the needed high solids retention time srt for efficient anaerobic treatment in addition the high concentration of dispersed growth increased rates of membrane fouling and reduced membrane flux both increased the membrane area required and the energy needed to control membrane fouling the saf mbr operated efficiently at short detention times that were comparable to or better than those of typical aerobic treatment systems but while gac worked well for cleaning of membranes that approach was too harsh and caused substantial membrane damage shin et al 2016a evans et al 2019 the major conclusion from the evans et al 2019 report was to better capture the relative advantages of each system a hybrid anmbr comprised of a gac fluidized bioreactor connected to a separate gas sparged ultrafiltration membrane system is proposed this will likely be more effective efficient robust resilient and cost effective we have now designed fabricated and operated the hybrid second generation system they proposed referring to it as the saf mbr 2 0 to our knowledge this is the first report of net energy positive operation achieved by a pilot scale anmbr 2 methods and materials 2 1 system configuration a pilot scale system consisting of a microscreen for primary treatment followed by a saf mbr 2 0 for secondary treatment was constructed at the codiga resource recovery center stanford ca as illustrated in fig 1 primary treatment was achieved by pumping raw domestic wastewater through a grit removal system followed by a microscreen ms 28 hydro international screen pore size 300 µm this screened effluent served as influent to saf mbr 2 0 which consisted of three reactors afbr 1 1 0 m3 798 kg gac afbr 2 1 8 m3 1230 kg gac and a gas sparged anmbr 1 7 m3 the afbrs used fluidized gac filtrasorb 300 calgon carbon as a biocarrier originally afbr 2 was designed and operated as a particle sparged anmbr but because of flow rate limitations the particle sparged anmbr was converted to a second afbr afbrs 1 and 2 were operated in parallel with external recirculation connecting them to initiate operation both reactors were seeded with active methanogenic biomass from an upflow anerobic sludge blanket uasb treating winery wastewater e j gallo winery fresno ca the pilot system then treated stanford domestic wastewater for more than three years prior to this study constant upflow velocities were maintained at 43 8 m h for afbr 1 and at 27 1 m h for afbr 2 a recirculation pump connected afbr 2 to afbr 1 membrane retained solids mrs from the anmbr were recirculated throughout the system via a second recirculation loop connected to afbr 1 enabling further hydrolysis of degradable suspended solids both recycled flows were twice the influent flow rate in order to maintain consistent mlss concentrations in all three reactors the solids retention time srt for the system was controlled by continuously wasting mrs with a peristaltic pump pu 77916 10 masterflex at a rate of 1 of influent flow the gas sparged anmbr was outfitted with three submersible membrane modules zeeweed 500d suez containing ultrafiltration membranes nominal pore size 0 04 µm and with two leapmbr diffusers suez that provided biogas sparging of the membranes for fouling control only two of the three membrane modules were used to simulate high flux conditions 12 l m2 h while maintaining the hrt minimum of 5 h membrane fouling was controlled with four measures 1 continuous ten minute cycling with an 8 min permeate pumping period pump on followed by a 2 min relaxation period pump off 2 use of two leapmbr diffusers that provided continuous gas sparging of membrane modules at a specific gas demand per unit membrane area sgdm of 0 21 nm3 m2 h 3 regular chemical maintenance cleaning mc and 4 chemical recovery cleaning rc mc consisted of two sequences of chemically enhanced backwashing ceb the first sequence used a 500 mg l sodium hypochlorite solution the second used a 2000 mg l citric acid solution each mc sequence began with a 2 min initial ceb pulse followed by four 30 s ceb pulses at a flux of 20 l m2 h each separated by a membrane relaxation period of 4 5 min rc was conducted when the trans membrane pressure tmp reached an upper limit set point 0 4 bar during rc the membrane tank was filled with an 1100 mg l sodium hypochlorite solution soaking the membranes in the solution for 24 h to eliminate organic foulant deposits the tank was then flushed and filled with a citric acid solution tank concentration of 2200 mg l and the membranes were soaked for another 24 h to remove inorganic foulants table 1 contains a summary of conditions for each of the three differrent flux regimes used after adjusting for the 20 relaxation period the higher flux third regime was subdivided into 2 sub periods iiia and iiib when liquid temperatures differed significantly 2 2 sample collection and data analysis several system process parameters were monitored and logged continuously using a programmable logic controller plc compactlogix allen bradley these parameters included fluidization loop ph and temperature signet 2724 gf tmp px831 omega engineering inc and influent and permeate flow rates signet 2551

detector gc tcd series 580 gow mac bethlehem pa and an autosampler raw wastewater and saf mbr 2 0 influent and effluent permeate were collected using composite samplers 5800 refrigerated sampler teledyne isco at each process stage 500 ml samples were collected every 30 min and then composited by mixing in a container prior to analysis grab samples were collected for mrs as its concentrations were less susceptible to diurnal fluctuations than constituent concentrations in raw wastewater cod was monitored using a spectrophotometric method epa 410 4 using cod test tubes method 8000 hach suspended solids ss alkalinity and dissolved methane concentrations were measured using methods described in shin et al 2014 acetate propionate and sulfate concentrations in influent and permeate samples were analyzed by ion chromatography ic dionextm integriontm hpictm system thermo scientific column dionex ionpac as11 thermo scientific energy balances for the saf mbr 2 0 system were developed for each operational period energy inputs computed as per shin and bae 2018 included 1 pumping energy for gac fluidization in the afbrs 2 pumping energy for external recirculation among the three reactors 3 pumping suction energy for permeate production and 4 gas compression energy for membrane gas sparging energy outputs included 1 computed energy from combustion of the recovered biogas methane shin and bae 2018 and 2 energy recovered from dissolved methane in the permeate assumed recovery of dissolved ch4 90 operational energy requirement 0 009 kwh m3 crone et al 2016 the efficiencies for gas blowers and combined heat and power chp were modified with updated data a chp electrical conversion efficiency of 38 lang et al 2017 and a blower energy efficiency of 65 lim et al 2019 were assumed more detailed information on energy calculations is provided in the supporting information some influent biodegradable colloidal cod was found to be smaller than the pore size of the submerged membranes 40 nm we refer to this fraction as ultrafine cod ufcod due to its small size ufcod can pass throught the membranes limiting the efficacy of membrane based size exclusion as a mechanism for its removal to investigate this finding we compared several characteristics of the influent ufcod with those of the permeate influent ufcod samples were obtained by filtering microscreen effluent i e saf mbr 2 0 influent through membrane filter paper 110 603 whatman with a pore size similar to that of the anmbr membranes then analyzed for cod a dynamic light scattering dls nanoparticle analyzer brookhaven instrument nanobrook omni was also used to measure nanometer scale particle size distributions in the influent ufcod in addition ufcod hydrolysis rates were obtained using a set of parallel biochemical methane potential bmp batch tests in which bmp vials were seeded with saf mbr 2 0 gac 18 75 g along with one of several substrates glucose acetate propionate or saf mbr 2 0 influent ufcod these data were analyzed as part of a companion modeling study shin et al 2021 3 results 3 1 cod removal table 2 contains summaries of cod concentrations and removal efficiencies for the overall system microscreen saf mbr 2 0 and for the saf mbr 2 0 alone during each operational period the lowest overall cod removal was 87 this value was observed during the period with the shortest hrt and lowest temperature period iiib saf mbr 2 0 cod removal was a function of hrt and temperature varying from 84 at a 10 h hrt to 83 at a 7 h hrt in period ii with further decreases in period iii at an hrt of 5 3 h 79 in period iiia with 20 c temperature conditions and 78 in period iiib with 20 c temperature conditions these cod removal efficiencies were low compared with results from other pilot scale anmbr studies 87 shin and bae 2018 3 2 cod mass balance fig 2 illustrates cod mass balances for periods ii iiia and iiib the fraction of cod used by sulfate reducing bacteria was no greater than about 0 5 mg l because of low influent sulfate 5 mgso4 2 l during period ii about 31 of the saf mbr 2 0 influent cod exited the system as permeate and as wasted mrs during period iiia with shorter hrt this fraction increased to 37 and then with lower temperature during period iiib it increased more to 42 during period iiib equipment malfunctions negatively affected methane gas measurements resulting in an underestimate of gaseous methane 3 3 net positive energy an energy balance was constructed for the saf mbr 2 0 pilot system comparing the energy for operation with the potential energy that could be obtained from the produced methane fig 3 data for period iiib was not used here because of the equipment caused gas measurement errors because the power required for system operation kw was constant the required energy per cubic meter of flow kwh m3 varied with flux as illustrated in fig 3 energy requirements for the saf mbr 2 0 ranged from 0 28 to 0 53 kwh m3 gas sparging represented the largest fraction comprising 70 of total energy demand as others have found crone et al 2016 the energy required for recovery of dissolved methane using degassing membranes is less than 0 01 kwh m3 much less than the energy required for gas sparging and fluidization assuming 90 recovery of dissolved methane crone et al 2016 mean energy production from all methane sources gaseous and dissolved for periods ii and iiia was 1 03 kwh m3 typically the energy conversion efficiency from combined heat and power chp is 38 lang et al 2017 so that the electrical energy produced would be 0 39 kwh m3 a value that exceeds the energy demand of 0 28 kwh m3 at a flux of 12 2 l m2 h by 0 11 kwh m3 the above analysis however does not include energy demands for preliminary and primary treatment nor of that produced from anaerobic digestion of primary microscreened material the additional energy demands longo et al 2016 include influent pumps 0 04 kwh m3 grit removal 0 007 kwh m3 and microscreen filtration 0 01 0 02 kwh m3 these additional demands total 0 06 0 07 kwh m3 at the high end on the positive side additional electrical energy 0 12 kwh m3 about one third of electrical energy produced from the secondary treatment mccarty et al 2011 would be generated from combustion of biogas produced by anaerobic digestion of the primary solids this additional net energy production represents about 0 05 0 06 kwh m3 which when combined with the net increase of 0 11 kwh m3 from secondary treatment gives a net energy production of 0 16 0 17 kwh m3 at the optimal net membrane flux of 12 2 l m2 h 3 4 removal of suspended solids and production of biosolids suspended solids in the influent permeate and wasted mrs were monitored to quantify suspended solids removal and biosolids production for each operational period as summarized in tables 3 and 4 the efficiency of suspended solids removal by membrane filtration was stable at 99 1 and was unaffected by other operational conditions table 4 contains a summary of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss for operational periods periods ii through iiib without srt upsets as expected the vss for disposal active biomass plus unhydrolyzed vss per unit of cod removed increased from 0 08 to 0 13 mgvss mgcodremoved likely due to less hydrolysis at lower srt and lower temperatures in a future full scale implementation wasted mrs containing appreciable cod due to operation at low srt or at low temperature could be thickened and stabilized in an anaerobic digester enabling additional energy recovery 3 5 membrane fouling and control measures fig 4 illustrates changes in net flux and tmp together with temperature and chemical cleaning conditions and table 5 contains related values for the rate of change in membrane permeability l m2 h bar day these latter value dk20 dt are corrected for temperature effects on viscosity by adjusting to the reference permeability at 20 c shin et al 2016b during period 1 tmp was stable at a flux of 6 5 l m2 h without any significant increase during period ii tmp increased due to the higher flux 9 4 l m2 h to mitigate fouling the first recovery cleaning rc was carried out on day 136 and tmp recovered to levels comparable to the original tmp during period iiia 12 3 l m2 h membrane fouling rates increased rapidly and the permeability change rate dropped to 2 6 l m2 h bar day table 5 accordingly on day 164 the mc frequency was increased from once every two weeks to once every week this increase effectively decreased the fouling rate to a value close to that of period ii during period iiib however weekly membrane cleaning was insufficient to control the increased rate of fouling as temperatures dropped below 20 c accordingly a second rc was carried out on day 274 and the mc frequency was increased to twice weekly increased chemical cleaning frequencies enabled flux values to reach 12 l m2 h evans et al 2018 reported that a pilot scale cstr anmbr operating at mc and rc cycles similar to those used in this work and treating similar strength wastewater were subject to higher rates of membrane fouling at a flux of 10 l m2 h and required more intensive gas sparging the lower membrane fouling rates in the saf mbr 2 0 were likely due to the much lower mrs in contact with the ultrafiltration membranes robles et al 2013 the saf mbr 2 0 incorporating attached growth gac biocarrier within afbr maintained mlss 6000 mg l at 6 h hrt with even lower values at 20 c while the cstr anmbr had mlss 10 000 mg l at 10 h hrt evans et al 2018 3 6 high permeate cod traced to biodegradable ufcod permeate cod during all operational periods was unexpectedly high with concentrations 84 mg l table 2 exceeding the united states cod secondary effluent standard of 60 mg l lim et al 2019 several possible explanations for this high permeate cod were investigated beginning with the possibility of membrane damage permeate grab samples from two sampling events were filtered through a laboratory scale ultrafiltration module prepared with 0 03 µm nominal pore size membranes samsung sdi and analyzed in triplicate there was no statistical difference between the permeate cods measured before and after filtration mrs filtered through a laboratory scale ultrafiltration module had the same cod as pilot scale permeate laboratory scale ultrafiltration modules with fresh membranes did not enhance cod removal illustrating that the submerged membranes were intact and functional another possible explanation for the high permeate cod was the presence of influent refractory cod accordingly bmp tests were used to assess the biodegradability of permeate cod shin et al 2021 the measured and predicted volumes of methane calculated from the permeate cod were in good agreement indicating that the permeate was fully biodegradable because acetate and propionate are major intermediates in methanogenesis permeate samples were also analyzed by ion chromatography neither acetate nor propionate concentrations were above the detection limits for any operational period even in permeate collected at low temperature to explore the possibility that permeate cod originated from influent colloidal organics we measured particle size distributions for the influent ufcod on a dls nanoparticle analyzer finding that the size of the influent ufcod ranged between 18 and 33 nm fig s1 smaller than the nominal ultrafiltration membrane pore size 40 nm further studies demonstrated that influent ufcod is susceptible to hydrolysis as it passes through ultrafiltration membranes its hydrolysis would be governed by hrt not srt in a companion modeling study shin et al 2021 hydrolysis rates of influent ufcod k h y d u f were independently determined these values were used to predict the permeate cod at steady state for each operational period the predictions matched measured values fig 5 implying that unhydrolyzed influent ufcod was likely the dominant contributor to permeate cod 4 discussion 4 1 optimization of energy and chemical demands for membrane cleaning this research underscores the trade off between energy demand for system operation largely due to fluidization and membrane sparging verses chemical demands for membrane fouling control because power input to the pumps and blower was maintained constant higher flux operation decreased energy demand but increased membrane fouling rates fouling rates can be controlled by implementation of an appropriate mc strategy section 3 5 fig 6 illustrates estimated values for opex m3 over different periods of operation including flux energy requirements mc frequency rc interval and membrane fouling rate dk20 dt energy costs were calculated from the energy demand kwh m3 excluding energy from produced methane unit prices of energy and chemicals were 0 1 kwh 279 m3 for 14 naocl solution and 835 m3 for 50 citric acid solution verrecht et al 2010 unit prices for mc and rc were 0 3 and 10 6 per cleaning event the rc interval t r c was determined from the membrane fouling rate dk20 dt l m2 h bar d according to eqs 1 and 2 1 k 20 m i n j 20 t m p m a x 2 t r c k 20 m i n k 20 0 d k 20 d t where j 20 is a normalized flux at 20 c shin et al 2016b and t m p m a x is the maximum tmp setpoint 0 4 bar the k 20 m i n is the minimum permeability for a given flux which are 16 3 23 5 and 31 3 l m2 h bar at 6 5 9 4 and 12 3 l m2 h flux conditions respectively k 20 0 is the initial permeability 90 l m2 h bar energy costs shaded blue fractions fig 6 are the largest contributor to opex greatly exceeding chemical costs for membrane cleaning and are driven by membrane flux opex were highest for the lowest flux case of 6 5 l m2 h even though chemical cleaning requirements green and orange fractions were minimal for operation at higher flux proper selection of mc frequency became critical at a flux of 9 4 l m2 h opex dropped by 21 due to increased flux but a further increase in flux to 12 3 l m2 h led to greatly increased fouling rates and larger opex because of shorter rc intervals 23 days as oppose to 180 days which are more costly than mc cleanings increasing mc frequency from once every two weeks column 3 to once per week column 4 and rc interval from 23 days to 292 days minimized mc and rc costs for the 12 3 l m2 h case enabling low opex at temperatures 20 c column 4 for temperatures 20 c operation under the same conditions i e flux of 12 2 l m2 h with once weekly cleaning led to increased rates of membrane fouling column 5 this was addressed by increasing mc frequency to twice weekly and decreasing the rc interval to 151 days the net effect of these changes was a decrease in opex taken together these operational results underscore the importance of flux conditions and their impacts on energy demand also critical is the mc frequency and its impact on the interval required for more costly rc measures 4 2 ufcod effects and management the high permeate cod observed in this study was unlike values obtained in previous pilot scale studies of the saf mbr 1 0 shin et al 2014 where effluent cod did not exceed 30 mg l this result may in part be explained by the more dilute influent cod of 270 mg l in the earlier study shin et al 2014 compared to the relatively high influent cod of 520 mg l in the present study if we assume that doubling of the influent cod results in a doubling of permeate cod then the expected permeate cod for the pilot scale saf mbr 2 0 would be 60 mg l but measured values were far greater 120 mg l one possible explanation for the high permeate cod concentration is an unusually high ufcod fraction 30 in the influent perhaps because the wastewater diverted from the stanford serra street sewer contained relatively fresh sewage and was subject to little hydrolysis prior to its collection other researchers have reported percentages of sub micron colloid cod for domestic wastewaters ranging from 9 to 15 levine et al 1991 in one study rickert and hunter 1971 the fraction of influent cod attributed to ufcod colloidal organic matter was just 8 of the influent cod most pilot scale anmbr studies to date evans et al 2018 summarized in shin and bae 2018 have likely had similar ufcod fractions i e close to 10 due to size exclusion the anmbr can thus achieve 90 cod removal efficiency at any hrt depending upon membrane pore size however for cases with a high ufcod fraction like those of the present study provisions need to be made for reduction of ufcod in the influent or elsewhere sufficient hrt for ufcod hydrolysis or modification of membranes by increasing bioreactor volume hrt could be increased while maintaining the same flux and membrane surface area without any significant increase in energy demand for membrane fouling control however for influent ufcod 150 mg l the hrt requirement could be 18 h to meet a secondary standard of 60 mg l at 20 c this hrt is excessive for secondary treatment not only is ufcod a regulatory concern and a source of lost methane it is also a critical membrane foulant it can plug membrane pores making it difficult to control clogging by gas sparging or membrane scouring measures that are more effective for removal of cake layer foulants the negative impacts of ufcod on membrane permeate cod and fouling rates may differ for aerobic mbrs where biological processes promote flocculation and coagulation rickert and hunter 1971 and hydrolysis rates may be more accelerated teo and wong 2014 4 3 needs for future study saf mbr 2 0 achieved net energy positive operation while treating influent containing 500 mgcod l for more dilute influent energy production would be less but membrane fouling would also be less potentially requiring less energy for gas sparging and or lower chemical cost for mcs and rcs the correlation between influent cod and membrane fouling rates needs further study as does the role of ufcod in membrane fouling including strategies for its mitigation a final issue that needs to be addressed is nutrient management and recovery shin and bae 2018 5 conclusions a pilot scale treatment train providing microscreened primary treatment and anaerobic secondary treatment with a saf mbr 2 0 system enabled 87 cod removal 99 ss removal on a small footprint hrt as low as 5 3 h and stable operation under temperate conditions 18 25 c with the gac biocarrier used sufficient biomass was retained within the afbr to enable efficient conversion of cod into methane moreover because the active microorganisms were largely attached to activated carbon particles within the afbr the anmbr compartment was operated efficiently with low levels of mrs 6000 mg mlvss l enabling operation at high flux 12 l m2 h and providing net positive energy operation energy costs constituted the largest fraction of operating expenses such costs could be reduced significantly by increasing the mc frequency this cleaning strategy permitted much longer rc intervals an unexpected discovery was the finding of significant biodegradable ufcod present as
