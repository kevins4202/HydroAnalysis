14365,in our earlier reported work we studied the removal of pb2 from aqueous media using surfactant modified chitosan smcs beads there it was shown that smcs beads could be used as an efficient adsorbent maximum adsorption capacity of 100 0 mg g for pb2 removal however after the removal of lead the waste sludge pb loaded smcs beads disposal becomes a real challenge to face this problem we have taken up the strategy to explore the possibility of further utilizing the waste beads for dye removal thus waste can serve as a resource in industrial ecology this is recognized as a closed loop system although this is an extended part of our previously published earlier work 3 but seems to be a very fruitful utilization of waste sludge in the present paper we studied the removal of two model dyes e g crystal violet cv and tartrazine tz using the waste smcs beads generated after pb2 adsorption these waste beads are designated as lead loaded surfactant modified chitosan pbl smcs beads it was interesting to note that even after adsorption of pb2 the smcs beads were able to remove the dyes effectively the kinetic studies showed rapid sorption dynamics following pseudo second order kinetic model equilibrium time obtained was 2 h for both the dyes which led to remove 90 of the dyes studies on the effect of dose revealed that 0 9 g l dose was the optimum to obtain 99 removal of cv and tz at a concentration of 20 mg l under the optimum ph conditions of 6 0 and 3 0 respectively isotherm data were fitted well to the langmuir and freundlich isotherm for cv and tz respectively langmuir adsorption capacity obtained for cv and tz removal was 97 09 and 30 03 mg g respectively these approaches are important in today s scenario to help in reducing the waste and recycling and reusing the adsorbent keywords chitosan surfactant modified chitosan beads pb2 crystal violet tartrazine adsorption 1 introduction large amount of dangerous pigments dyes and heavy metals originated from various manufacturing processes including dye manufacturing textile pulp and paper cosmetics pharmaceuticals battery manufacturing industries are emitted into wastewaters great attention is required for elimination of the toxic dyes and heavy metals due to their visibility problems and various other long term diseases 1 3 presence of different types of contaminants in the wastewater makes treatment of wastewater difficult to overcome the problem of the different contaminants treatment processes are segregated treatment methods include adsorption using various chemical and biological adsorbents coagulation ﬂocculation photo catalytic decolorization of dyes or photo degradation of hazardous compounds ozonation microbial decomposition and electrochemical methods etc 1 4 5 adsorption is one of the most widely used methods because of the ease of operation and giving promising results 6 9 adsorbent materials used for adsorption should be environmental friendly and readily available non toxic and cheap chitosan is one of such adsorbents and it has many applications in the field of environment as well as others ma et al 10 reported that the cs solution only can lead to obtain the ultrahigh adsorption capacity for removal of cationic and anionic dyes for instance author reported the equilibrium adsorption capacities of 1457 1 mg g for mb and 990 0 mg g for rhodamineb rhb it was also reported that chitosan solution can also remove the cu ii and ni ii ions with the maximum adsorption capacities of 405 and 315 mg g respectively with the initial metal ion concentration of 1000 mg l 11 chitosan in the form of beads has come up in many of the researches which showed that chitosan beads have very good adsorption efficiency for dye removal from textile wastewater antibiotics removal from pharmaceutical wastewater and metal removal from industrial wastewaters 12 17 present research demonstrates the adsorption of pb2 using surfactant modified chitosan smcs beads in the first step followed by cv and tz removal individually from aqueous solution the second step i e the removal of dyes was considered in order to recycle the sludge remained after pb2 adsorption chitosan cs beads were prepared using the method reported by mitani et al 18 to get enhanced lead adsorption the surface of cs beads was modified with sodium dodecyl sulfate sds an anionic surfactant as sds concentration chosen for the modification was cmc to make the cs beads heavily loaded with the surfactant the idea behind opting as concentration cmc is to form a surfactant bilayer over the cs beads 3 19 20 cs beads after modification with sds were designated as surfactant modified chitosan smcs beads which were then used for the adsorption of pb2 from aqueous solution the selected range of pb2 was 10 100 mg l results depicted that smcs beads successfully removed the pb2 from aqueous solution with the maximum adsorption capacity of 100 0 mg g dry weight 3 after adsorption of the pb2 onto smcs beads the adsorbent was named as lead loaded smcs pbl smcs beads previously the research of pal and pal 14 also showed similar observations where methylene blue mb was removed after cadmium adsorption over smcs beads in the present work the waste smcs beads after lead adsorption was used as an adsorbent for removal of cv and tz from aqueous solutions fig 1 describes the work in a stepwise manner the adsorbents smcs pbl smcs were characterized by sem edax and ftir to reveal the properties of adsorbents before and after dye adsorption 2 materials and methods 2 1

and an orbital shaking incubator remi india was used for shaking solutions at an agitation speed of 100 rpm and at a temperature of 30 c absorbance of cv and tz was recorded in the uv vis spectrophotometer spectrascan uv 2600 chemito india at 590 and 425 nm respectively the concentration of pb2 was measured in the atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas thermoscientific model no ic3300 at primary wavelength 217 nm ir spectra were measured with fourier transform infrared ftir spectrophotometer nexus 870 usa scanning electron microscopic sem analysis was carried out in merlin zeiss gemini2 germany coupled with edax 2 2 preparation of adsorbents 2 2 1 preparation of cs and smcs beads detailed procedure of cs bead preparation and its modification can be referred to our previously published report on the pb2 removal using smcs beads 3 21 in brief chitosan solution was prepared by adding 3 g of cs powder in 250 ml of 7 w v aa the solution was thoroughly stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 7 8 h to make it a homogenous colloidal solution and air free the chitosan solution was added drop wise in a coagulating mixture using a 5 ml micropipette to form spherical cs beads cs beads were whitish in color and contained about 97 3 water 3 prepared cs beads were having the average diameter d 3 5 0 32 mm these beads were then subjected to surfactant modification to make smcs beads the sds conc of 6000 mg l cmc was applied for the preparation of smcs beads in a typical experiment 250 beads were added in 100 ml of sds solution having concentration cmc the beaker was kept undisturbed for three days to get maximum adsorption of sds onto cs beads 2 2 2 pb2 loading onto smcs beads smcs beads were used for pb2 removal in the range of 10 100 mg l as elaborated in our earlier report 3 smcs beads were efficient for pb2 removal the pb2 loading observed in smcs beads were 22 54 36 27 61 20 95 26 151 95 mg g for 10 20 30 50 100 mg l of initial pb2 concentration respectively the smcs beads after pb2 removal at the initial concentration of 100 mg l was designated as pbl smcs beads which were then used as an adsorbent for dye removal 2 2 3 cv and tz removal by pbl smcs beads pbl smcs beads were used for the removal of cv and tz from their individual aqueous solutions cv and tz stock solution of 500 mg l was prepared followed by the dilutions for making the working solutions in the range of 5 100 mg l pbl smcs beads were added separately to cv and tz solutions with varied concentrations 5 100 mg l after performing the experiments the concentration of cv and tz was calculated by the equation obtained from calibration curve the λmax was recorded at 590 and 425 nm respectively for cv and tz different set of experiments were performed to optimize the parameters and to compute the kinetic and adsorption isotherm constants fig 2 shows the steps followed from cs to smcs and smcs to pbl smcs beads preparation it also shows the schematic of the overall adsorption process along with the photograph showing the color difference before and after adsorption of cv and tz 2 3 batch adsorption studies evaluation of cs smcs and pbl smcs beads for cv and tz removal was done to find out the best adsorbent for both the dyes the selected adsorbent was further utilized for batch adsorption studies to optimize the different parameters to maximize the removal batch experiments were performed at 30 c in a 20 ml glass vial that contained 5 ml of cv and tz solution of desired concentration and suitable ph and dose of 0 9 g l prior to that the adsorption performance of smcs beads studied by varying the concentration of pb2 from 10 to 100 mg l which is reported in the recent study of pal and pal 3 maximum adsorption capacity obtained for pb2 adsorption was 100 0 mg g for the preparation of lead loaded smcs pbl smcs beads pb2 concentration was chosen as 100 mg l to load maximum pb2 over the smcs beads the beads were now designated as pbl smcs beads pbl smcs beads were then used for the removal of cv and tz effect of concentration of the dyes was analyzed by varying the concentration in the range of 10 100 mg l the effect of ph on cv and tz removal was studied by changing the initial ph from 3 0 to 10 0 dose of adsorbent was also optimized by varying the dose from 0 18 to 1 35 g l kinetic study was performed with the 20 mg l concentration of cv and tz varying the contact time from 5 min to 36 h cv and tz concentration was calculated by the equation obtained by analyzing the known concentration of the dyes the removal was calculated by eq 1 1 r c 0 c t c 0 100 the amount of adsorbate adsorbed to the adsorbent was computed by eq 2 2 q t c 0 c t d where c0 and ct are the dye concentrations in mg l at zero time and t time respectively d is the dose g l used in the solution and qt capacity is the mg of adsorbate adsorbed per gram of the adsorbent mg g at time t after optimizing the adsorption parameters equilibrium studies were performed with the optimized parameters of 0 36 g l adsorbent dose for cv and 0 72 g l dose for tz contact time of 2 0 h ph 3 0 for tz and 6 0 for cv agitation speed of 100 rpm and temperature of 30 c data obtained from kinetic and isotherm equilibrium study was applied to different models which are shown in table 1 the isotherm models of langmuir 22 freundlich 23 dubinin radhuskevich d r 24 and temkin 25 were used to describe the equilibrium adsorption isotherm data the values of langmuir constants qm and kl were calculated from the slope and intercept of the plot of ce qe vs ce the qm and kl are the maximum adsorption capacity and langmuir constant the freundlich constant kf and exponent n are calculated from the intercept and slope of the plot of ln qe vs ln ce plot of qe vs ln ce enables to determine the temkin constants at l mg and b j mol rt b which is equilibrium binding constant and constant related to heat of sorption d r constants bd and qm mg g were calculated from the plot of ln qe and ε2 ε polanyi potential rt ln 1 1 ce the suitability of the model was evaluated considering the linear isotherm models and coefficients of determination r2 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization 3 1 1 scanning electron microscopy sem sem images of pbl smcs beads crystal violet adsorbed pbl smcs beads cv pb smcs and tartrazine adsorbed pbl smcs beads tz pb smcs are shown in fig 3 a f edax mapping of the adsorbents is also shown graphically in fig 3 g i sem images illustrate that there is remarkable difference in surface morphologies of all the beads the difference can be easily seen in the low as well as in high resolution the differences in the surface morphologies are due to the adsorption of dye molecules on the surface of pbl smcs beads as it is shown in fig 3 b c sem images of pbl smcs beads have shown the small structures which on the low resolution can be seen as smooth surface due to the seamless layer of pb2 over smcs beads on the other hand after cv and tz loading onto pbl smcs beads some rough circular and bigger structures can be seen over the smooth surface which we can speculate to be due to the adsorption of dye molecules edax images are shown to support the presence of dye molecules over pbl smcs beads in fig 3 g a large peak of lead is observed which shows 86 83 wt of lead the other two edax images of cv and tz loaded pbl smcs showed the presence of the elements of the respective dyes for instance fig 3 h shows the traces of chloride which is coming from the cv and fig 3 i confirms the presence of sulfur and sodium from tz 3 1 2 ftir spectroscopy ftir spectroscopy was done to assess the functional groups present in the composites of smcs beads before and after adsorption of pb2 as well as after dye adsorption the presence of functional groups plays an important role in adsorption of adsorbate onto adsorbent 26 the characteristic peaks in the range of 600 750 cm 1 revealed the presence of sulphate groups in smcs pbl smcs cv pbl smcs and tz pbl smcs beads the bands in the region of 800 cm 1 may be assigned to mono substituted aromatic rings the peaks observed in the 1102 1200 cm 1 range may be explained by the presence of coc stretching of ether 5 the peaks at 1639 cm 1 indicate the presence of bending vibration of hydroxyl groups of water which involves in the formation of hydrogen bonds and the peak at 1398 cm 1 may be assigned to the bending vibration of ch2 in smcs beads the peak at 1639 cm 1 is less intense in other three curves such as pbl smcs cv pb smcs and tz pb smcs beads peaks at 1591 cm 1 and 1530 cm 1 is assigned to aromatic ring 27 which was absent in the smcs and pbl smcs beads we can say that these peaks were emerged due the cv and tz adsorption the peak at 2851 cm 1 corresponds to ch2 stretching of aliphatic groups 1 the broad peaks at 3406 cm 1 corresponds to the presence of oh group and primary and secondary amines 26 28 29 while the peaks around 2924 cm 1 could be ascribed to the asymmetric stretch of ch2 group 28 there was not much change observed in the peaks before and after adsorption few peaks emerged out due to aromatic rings and interaction of the dye with the pbl smcs beads after the adsorption of cv and tz confirm that chemical adsorption is also involved in the adsorption of cv and tz over pbl smcs beads fig 4 3 2 selection of dyes and adsorbent 3 2 1 preliminary comparison of cs smcs and pbl smcs beads for dye removal for preliminary studies the cs smcs and pbl smcs beads loaded with 100 mg g of pb2 were analyzed for the removal of two anionic dyes methyl orange mo and tz and two cationic dyes cv and mb the initial concentration of dyes was 50 mg l and the adsorbent dose was 0 45 g l the experiments were conducted under the controlled condition of 30 c and 100 rpm to provide better mixing of the dyes with the adsorbent it was found that the removal of cv and tz was better than two other tested dyes viz mb and mo in spite of the anionic nature of mo chitosan cs smcs and pbl smcs beads removed only 27 46 of the dye for mb also 7 33 43 59 and 57 93 removal was achieved by cs smcs and pbl smcs beads respectively therefore for further experiments cv cationic and tz anionic dyes were chosen it was also observed that pbl smcs beads were better adsorbent than the cs and smcs beads fig 5 this implied that the waste sludge of smcs beads after lead removal has the potential to remove dyes hence pbl smcs beads were chosen for further experiments in order to recycle and reuse them for cv and tz removal this may lead to waste minimization 3 3 parameter optimization for dye removal 3 3 1 effect of ph solution ph is an important parameter in case of dyes because with the change of solution ph their color and absorption maxima may vary thus it was felt pertinent to examine the effect of ph on the dye solutions without adsorbent 30 for this particular study dye solutions 20 mg l were prepared at different ph and spectrophotometric analysis was done to observe any changes either in the λmax and or in the absorbance value it was observed that increase in the ph of the dye solutions without adding the adsorbent also causes in the decrease of the absorbance value fig 6 a b this condition puts the restriction of doing the adsorption experiments at extreme basic ph conditions the range of ph where the cv and tz absorbance was stable was 4 0 6 0 and 2 0 7 0 respectively the ph of the dyes was maintained accordingly the variation of ph from 3 0 to 10 0 was made to see its effect on the removal of both the dyes the ph was adjusted using 1 n hno3 and 1 n naoh the resulted graph fig 6 c shows that increase in ph of cv did not show much difference in removal as it can be seen in the graph that upon increasing ph from 3 to 10 the removal obtained was 88 91 with the maximum removal at ph 6 0 hence for further experiments the ph of cv solution was maintained at 6 0 unlike cv the variation of solution ph showed significant difference in the removal efficiency of tz it is also clear from fig 6 c that the removal of tz decreased from 80 to 50 upon increasing the ph from 3 0 to 10 0 the ph of the tz solution for further experiments was maintained at 3 0 to get the maximum removal for evaluating the effect of ph the concentration of dyes was taken as 20 mg l with the dose of 0 9 g l keeping batch volume as 5 0 ml all the experiments were done in the incubator shaker at 100 rpm and 30 c 3 3 2 effect of dose adsorbent dose is the amount of adsorbent used for the removal of particular concentration of the adsorbate adsorbent has particular number of adsorption sites for fixed amount of adsorbate increase in dose provides the larger number of sites which in turn increases the removal efficiency of the adsorbate the influence of the dose of pbl smcs beads on cv and tz removal was studied at the dye solution ph of 6 0 and 3 0 respectively with an agitation speed of 100 rpm at temperature 30 c obtained results are shown in fig 7 along with the photograph showing the change of dye color with the dose variation in this study the dose was varied in the range 0 18 1 35 g l concentration of cv and tz was selected as 20 mg l the removal of cv did not show any significant change with the increase in the dose for instance removal of cv was 87 89 at almost all the doses however the removal of tz increased from 45 74 to 90 at initial tz concentration of 20 mg l with an increase in the dose of pbl smcs beads from 0 18 to 1 35 g l it is worthy to note that the dose of 0 72 g l was sufficient to get 90 removal beyond this dose there was not much change in the removal of tz on the other hand 0 18 g l adsorbent dose was sufficient to attain 87 60 removal of cv the results are in accordance with the various reported researches based on the chitosan biosorbents 20 28 higher adsorbent dosage resulted in the decreased adsorption capacity due to the fact that there was significant unsaturation of adsorption active sites at fixed dye concentration 31 32 this is also supported by the study of klett et al 33 which shows the decrease in adsorption capacity upon increasing the adsorbent dose of nickel doped zinc oxide ni0 05zn0 95o nanoparticles for the removal of mo and tz 33 3 3 3 effect of initial adsorbate concentration the effect of initial dye concentration in the range of 5 100 mg l cv and tz was studied while the agitation speed of 100 rpm for 2 h was maintained the ph of the medium was maintained as 6 0 and 3 0for cv and tz respectively the graph obtained by plotting the data is shown in fig 8 a it is observed that as the initial dye concentration was increased from 5 to 100 mg l the percentage removal of cv as well as tz gradually decreased it is shown in fig 8 a that cv removal decreased from 87 03 to 31 33 whereas tz removal decreased from 84 61 to 41 28 as the initial dye concentration was increased from 5 to 100 mg l this is due to the fact that while keeping the adsorbent dose fixed with the increase of dye concentration the relative number of cites decreases in order to check the reproducibility of the results three replicate batch studies were conducted at varying concentrations ranging from 5 to 100 mg l at the equilibrium time of 2 h with the dose of 0 36 and 0 72 for cv and tz respectively agitation speed of 120 rpm was maintained at the temperature of 30 c the standard deviation sd and standard error std error calculation shows that the sd varies in the range from 1 13 to 5 12 for cv and 0 97 7 3 for tz fig 8b 3 3 4 kinetics and order of reaction the time required to attain the equilibrium for the dye adsorption was evaluated with the adsorbent pbl smcs beads the initial concentration of cv and tz dye was chosen as 20 mg l and the adsorbent dose was fixed at 0 72 g l keeping other parameters same agitation speed was maintained as 100 rpm at the temperature of 30 c the time varied for the kinetic study was 5 min to 24 h the effect of contact time on cv and tz removal r and capacity mg g by pbl smcs beads is shown in fig 9 a the figure clearly shows that with increase in time from 5 min to 120 min there is sharp increase in the percent removal of adsorbate when there is concentration gradient between adsorbate present in the solution and the adsorbent 34 in 120 min the removal obtained was 85 44 and 82 75 for cv and tz respectively after 2 h when the contact time was further increased up to 24 h there was no significant increase in the removal of dyes hence equilibrium time chosen for further studies was 2 h kinetic data obtained was applied to the pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetic models it was found that the data complied with the pseudo second order model with the equilibrium adsorption capacity of 25 25 mg g for cv and 29 76 mg g for tz table 2 the pseudo second order plots for both the dyes are shown in fig 9 b the r2 values obtained for cv and tz was 0 994 and 0 999 respectively table 2 which indicated that the adsorption process followed pseudo second order model for both the dyes the kinetic results also indicate that the adsorption of cv and tz on to pbl smcs beads is chemical in nature fig 9 c shows the theoretical and experimental curve fitting for adsorption capacity 3 3 5 effect of agitation speed the effect of agitation speed on the adsorption of cv and tz onto pbl smcs beads was studied fig 10 shows that the sorption amount of cv increased significantly with increase in the agitation speed from 0 to 180 rpm on the contrary the tz removal was reduced upon increasing the agitation speed from 120 to 180 rpm the reason for increase in the cv adsorption upon increasing the agitation may be the increase in the movement of the dye molecules which also increases the conatct between the adsorbate and adsorbent the adsorption occurred on the surface of the adsorbent up on crossing the barrier offered by bulk particles in the solution and the boundary layer of the adsorbent this resulted in the diffusion of the adsorbate molecules in to the bulk of the adsorbent 35 36 on the other hand tz removal was decreased from 77 to 60 as the agitation rate was increased beyond 120 rpm it is depicted in the figure that 100 and 120 rpm is suitable for the tz removal there is no significant difference in removal at 100 and 120 rpm in both the cases for cv as well as tz cv removal was 78 93 and tz removal was 77 80 at 120 rpm decrease in tz removal upon increasing the rpm may be due to the increase in randomness of the particles which lead to the movement of tz molecules away from the adsorbent surface it may be possible that due to the physical adsorption of the tz molecules increase in agitation speed results in detaching the loosely bound molecules from the surface of pbl smcs beads on the basis of the above results it can be concluded that the adsorption of cv and tz on pbl smcs beads is dependent on the agitation speed 7 3 4 thermodynamic study the effect of temperature on the removal of cv and tz by pbl smcs was studied in the temperature range of 30 50 c and the other thermodynamic parameters were calculated concentration of the dyes was fixed at 20 mg l and the equilibrium time 2 h agitation speed was maintained at 120 rpm it was observed that the temperature had positive effect on the removal efficiency of pbl smcs beads for both cv and tz upon increasing the temperature from 30 to 50 c there was increment in the removal from 87 79 to 93 41 for cv and 58 to 70 in case of tz fig 11 a shows the graph plotted between the concentrations of dyes left after adsorption by pbl smcs beads at varying temperatures similar results were also obtained by liang et al 37 there it has been suggested that with increase in the temperature there is more energy available for adsorbate to move towards the adsorbent surface 37 the experiment was done to analyze the effect of temperature and on the basis of obtained data thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy change δh entropy change δs and gibbs free energy change δg were calculated thermodynamic parameters are as important as the other parameters optimization for an adsorption system to gain an insight into the adsorption process various thermodynamic parameters were calculated by the slope and intercept of van t hoff plot fig 11 b total heat of the system or internal energy of the system is measured by enthalpy and degree of randomness of the system is measured by entropy 38 39 when the system is kept isolated without transfer of heat from the environment to the system entropy is considered to be the driving force for adsorption 5 30 40 41 thermodynamic parameters were computed using eqs 3 5 and the van t hoff plot of ln ke vs 1 t fig 11 b 3 l n k e δ s r δ h r t 4 k e c 0 c e c e 5 δ g r t ln k e where c0 and ce mg l is the initial and equilibrium dye concentration in the solution ke the equilibrium constant or distribution coefficient δs is the entropy change j mol k δh is the enthalpy change kj mol δg is the gibb s free energy change kj mol for the system r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k and t is the temperature of the solution k the gibbs free energy obtained for the cv and tz adsorption at different temperatures was negative which indicates that the adsorption is spontaneous and favorable highest negative value 7 12 kj mol for δg is obtained at 323 k table 3 which implies that the adsorption process is energetically more favored at higher temperature 42 43 due to the more interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent 41 44 positive value of δs indicates the increased randomness of the system positive value of change in enthalpy δh specifies that the adsorption process is endothermic 45 δh values for cv and tz adsorption onto pbl smcs beads were found to be 27 82 and 16 47 kj mol respectively which reveals the chemical adsorption 46 it is common in most of the adsorption processes on the basis of the parameters we can conclude that the adsorption of cv and tz over pbl smcs beads is favorable and spontaneous 3 5 equilibrium isotherm study isotherm gives the idea about the distribution of adsorbate in solution phase and in the adsorption phase under the equilibrium condition in order to understand the adsorption process in further details the isotherm data were fitted to various isotherm models and on the basis of r2 values it was assumed which isotherm was best followed 3 19 20 25 different isotherm models have different assumptions on the basis of the mechanism involved in the adsorption process for instance monolayer sorption with a finite number of active sites on the adsorbent is one of the assumptions of the langmuir adsorption isotherm 22 freundlich isotherm describes the heterogeneous layer or multilayer formation on the surface of adsorbent because of non uniform distribution of heat of adsorption over the surface 23 temkin isotherm gives the idea about the adsorbate adsorbent interaction by the factor which describes that the heat of adsorption of all the molecules in the layer decreases linearly with the adsorbent adsorbate interactions d r isotherm model was usually applied to distinguish the physical and chemical adsorption with its mean free energy which is denoted by e e 1 2 b d for isotherm study of cv and tz the concentration was varied from 5 to 100 mg l the dose was selected as 0 36 and 0 72 g l for cv and tz respectively the experiments were done in the incubator shaker keeping rpm fixed as 100 and temperature at 30 c the contact time was 2 h calculated values of langmuir freundlich temkin and d r constants for cv and tz are compiled in table 4 the linear plots of all the applied models are shown in fig 12 a d on the basis of the values of coefficient of determination r2 it can be assumed that the adsorption of cv onto pbl smcs beads followed langmuir isotherm while that for tz followed freundlich model table 4 this variation may be due to the different size and chemical structure of the adsorbate molecules causing different affinities towards pbl smcs beads 4 performance evaluation results obtained from some of the reported researches for the removal of cv and tz using different adsorbents have been summarized in table 5 and the adsorption capacities of different adsorbents are compared with that obtained for pbl smcs beads the results show that pbl smcs beads are potential adsorbent for cv and tz removal from water medium 5 conclusions the present study focuses on the utilization of waste beads generated after the adsorptive removal of lead from aqueous solution removal of pb2 was done by applying the adsorbent prepared by sds modification of chitosan cs beads the surfactant was used in the concentration cmc which was believed to form bilayer over the cs surface under controlled conditions after adsorption of pb2 the beads which were designated as pbl smcs beads were used to remove the anionic as well as cationic dye viz tartrazine tz and crystal violet cv it was found that pbl smcs beads were able to remove both the dyes well the confirmation of the cv and tz adsorption onto pbl smcs was done by sem edax and ftir analysis the optimum ph for cv removal was 6 6 5 and that for tz was 3 3 5 equilibrium time for removal of cv and tz was 2 h cv and tz adsorption onto pbl smcs beads was the function of time agitation speed and temperature cv and tz removal onto pbl smcs followed langmuir and freundlich isotherms respectively langmuir adsorption capacity obtained for cv and tz removal was 97 09 and 30 03 mg g adsorption process followed pseudo second order model thermodynamic data showed that the adsorption process of cv and tz onto pbl smcs beads was energetically and entropically favorable and spontaneous exact mechanism of the adsorption of cv and tz onto pbl smcs beads was not known the interesting part of this work is that smcs beads after the removal of pb2 3 could besuccessfully utilized for the removal of cv and tz the approach of this study is new and it can be a good example of recycling of waste sludge the present work may satisfy the concept of waste recycling and reuse or closed loop system in industrial ecology acknowledgement the authors are thankful to iit kharagpur india for providing facilities and financial support to carry out this research 
14365,in our earlier reported work we studied the removal of pb2 from aqueous media using surfactant modified chitosan smcs beads there it was shown that smcs beads could be used as an efficient adsorbent maximum adsorption capacity of 100 0 mg g for pb2 removal however after the removal of lead the waste sludge pb loaded smcs beads disposal becomes a real challenge to face this problem we have taken up the strategy to explore the possibility of further utilizing the waste beads for dye removal thus waste can serve as a resource in industrial ecology this is recognized as a closed loop system although this is an extended part of our previously published earlier work 3 but seems to be a very fruitful utilization of waste sludge in the present paper we studied the removal of two model dyes e g crystal violet cv and tartrazine tz using the waste smcs beads generated after pb2 adsorption these waste beads are designated as lead loaded surfactant modified chitosan pbl smcs beads it was interesting to note that even after adsorption of pb2 the smcs beads were able to remove the dyes effectively the kinetic studies showed rapid sorption dynamics following pseudo second order kinetic model equilibrium time obtained was 2 h for both the dyes which led to remove 90 of the dyes studies on the effect of dose revealed that 0 9 g l dose was the optimum to obtain 99 removal of cv and tz at a concentration of 20 mg l under the optimum ph conditions of 6 0 and 3 0 respectively isotherm data were fitted well to the langmuir and freundlich isotherm for cv and tz respectively langmuir adsorption capacity obtained for cv and tz removal was 97 09 and 30 03 mg g respectively these approaches are important in today s scenario to help in reducing the waste and recycling and reusing the adsorbent keywords chitosan surfactant modified chitosan beads pb2 crystal violet tartrazine adsorption 1 introduction large amount of dangerous pigments dyes and heavy metals originated from various manufacturing processes including dye manufacturing textile pulp and paper cosmetics pharmaceuticals battery manufacturing industries are emitted into wastewaters great attention is required for elimination of the toxic dyes and heavy metals due to their visibility problems and various other long term diseases 1 3 presence of different types of contaminants in the wastewater

biological adsorbents coagulation ﬂocculation photo catalytic decolorization of dyes or photo degradation of hazardous compounds ozonation microbial decomposition and electrochemical methods etc 1 4 5 adsorption is one of the most widely used methods because of the ease of operation and giving promising results 6 9 adsorbent materials used for adsorption should be environmental friendly and readily available non toxic and cheap chitosan is one of such adsorbents and it has many applications in the field of environment as well as others ma et al 10 reported that the cs solution only can lead to obtain the ultrahigh adsorption capacity for removal of cationic and anionic dyes for instance author reported the equilibrium adsorption capacities of 1457 1 mg g for mb and 990 0 mg g for rhodamineb rhb it was also reported that chitosan solution can also remove the cu ii and ni ii ions with the maximum adsorption capacities of 405 and 315 mg g respectively with the initial metal ion concentration of 1000 mg l 11 chitosan in the form of beads has come up in many of the researches which showed that chitosan beads have very good adsorption efficiency for dye removal from textile wastewater antibiotics removal from pharmaceutical wastewater and metal removal from industrial wastewaters 12 17 present research demonstrates the adsorption of pb2 using surfactant modified chitosan smcs beads in the first step followed by cv and tz removal individually from aqueous solution the second step i e the removal of dyes was considered in order to recycle the sludge remained after pb2 adsorption chitosan cs beads were prepared using the method reported by mitani et al 18 to get enhanced lead adsorption the surface of cs beads was modified with sodium dodecyl sulfate sds an anionic surfactant as sds concentration chosen for the modification was cmc to make the cs beads heavily loaded with the surfactant the idea behind opting as concentration cmc is to form a surfactant bilayer over the cs beads 3 19 20 cs beads after modification with sds were designated as surfactant modified chitosan smcs beads which were then used for the adsorption of pb2 from aqueous solution the selected range of pb2 was 10 100 mg l results depicted that smcs beads successfully removed the pb2 from aqueous solution with the maximum adsorption capacity of 100 0 mg g dry weight 3 after adsorption of the pb2 onto smcs beads the adsorbent was named as lead loaded smcs pbl smcs beads previously the research of pal and pal 14 also showed similar observations where methylene blue mb was removed after cadmium adsorption over smcs beads in the present work the waste smcs beads after lead adsorption was used as an adsorbent for removal of cv and tz from aqueous solutions fig 1 describes the work in a stepwise manner the adsorbents smcs pbl smcs were characterized by sem edax and ftir to reveal the properties of adsorbents before and after dye adsorption 2 materials and methods 2 1

and an orbital shaking incubator remi india was used for shaking solutions at an agitation speed of 100 rpm and at a temperature of 30 c absorbance of cv and tz was recorded in the uv vis spectrophotometer spectrascan uv 2600 chemito india at 590 and 425 nm respectively the concentration of pb2 was measured in the atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas thermoscientific model no ic3300

gemini2 germany coupled with edax 2 2 preparation of adsorbents 2 2 1 preparation of cs and smcs beads detailed procedure of cs bead preparation and its modification can be referred to our previously published report on the pb2 removal using smcs beads 3 21 in brief chitosan solution was prepared by adding 3 g of cs powder in 250 ml of 7 w v aa the solution was thoroughly stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 7 8 h to make it a homogenous colloidal solution and air free the chitosan solution was added drop wise in a coagulating mixture using a 5 ml micropipette to form spherical cs beads cs beads were whitish in color and contained about 97 3 water 3 prepared cs beads were having the average diameter d 3 5 0 32 mm these beads were then subjected to surfactant modification to make smcs beads the sds conc of 6000 mg l cmc was applied for the preparation of smcs beads in a typical experiment 250 beads were added in 100 ml of sds solution having concentration cmc the beaker was kept undisturbed for three days to get maximum adsorption of sds onto cs beads 2 2 2 pb2 loading onto smcs beads smcs beads were used for pb2 removal in the range of 10 100 mg l as elaborated in our earlier report 3 smcs beads were efficient for pb2 removal the pb2 loading observed in smcs beads were 22 54 36 27 61 20 95 26 151 95 mg g for 10 20 30 50 100 mg l of initial pb2 concentration respectively the smcs beads after pb2 removal at the initial concentration of 100 mg l was designated as pbl smcs beads which were then used as an adsorbent for dye removal 2 2 3 cv and tz removal by pbl smcs beads pbl smcs beads were used for the removal of cv and tz from their individual aqueous solutions cv and tz stock solution of 500 mg l was prepared followed by the dilutions for making the working solutions in the range of 5 100 mg l pbl smcs beads were added separately to cv and tz solutions with varied concentrations 5 100 mg l after performing the experiments the concentration of cv and tz was calculated by the equation obtained from calibration curve the λmax was recorded at 590 and 425 nm respectively for cv and tz different set of experiments were performed to optimize the parameters and to compute the kinetic and adsorption isotherm constants fig 2 shows the steps followed from cs to smcs and smcs to pbl smcs beads preparation it also shows the schematic of the overall adsorption process along with the photograph showing the color difference before and after adsorption of cv and tz 2 3 batch adsorption studies evaluation of cs smcs and pbl smcs beads for cv and tz removal was done to find out the best adsorbent for both the dyes the selected adsorbent was further utilized for batch adsorption studies to optimize the different parameters to maximize the removal batch experiments were performed at 30 c in a 20 ml glass vial that contained 5 ml of cv and tz solution of desired concentration and suitable ph and dose of 0 9 g l prior to that the adsorption performance of smcs beads studied by varying the concentration of pb2 from 10 to 100 mg l which is reported in the recent study of pal and pal 3 maximum adsorption capacity obtained for pb2 adsorption was 100 0 mg g for the preparation of lead loaded smcs pbl smcs beads pb2 concentration was chosen as 100 mg l to load maximum pb2 over the smcs beads the beads were now designated as pbl smcs beads pbl smcs beads were then used for the removal of cv and tz effect of concentration of the dyes was analyzed by varying the concentration in the range of 10 100 mg l the effect of ph on cv and tz removal was studied by changing the initial ph from 3 0 to 10 0 dose of adsorbent was also optimized by varying the dose from 0 18 to 1 35 g l kinetic study was performed with the 20 mg l concentration of cv and tz varying the contact time from 5 min to 36 h cv and tz concentration was calculated by the equation obtained by analyzing the known concentration of the dyes the removal was calculated by eq 1 1 r c 0 c t c 0 100 the amount of adsorbate adsorbed to the adsorbent was computed by eq 2 2 q t c 0 c t d where c0 and ct are the dye concentrations in mg l at zero time and t time respectively d is the dose g l used in the solution and qt capacity is the mg of adsorbate adsorbed per gram of the adsorbent mg g at time t after optimizing the adsorption parameters equilibrium studies were performed with the optimized parameters of 0 36 g l adsorbent dose for cv and 0 72 g l dose for tz contact time of 2 0 h ph 3 0 for tz and 6 0 for cv agitation speed of 100 rpm and temperature of 30 c data obtained from kinetic and isotherm equilibrium study was applied to different models which are shown in table 1 the isotherm models of langmuir 22 freundlich 23 dubinin radhuskevich d r 24 and temkin 25 were used to describe the equilibrium adsorption isotherm data the values of langmuir constants qm and kl were calculated from the slope and intercept of the plot of ce qe vs ce the qm and kl are the maximum adsorption capacity and langmuir constant the freundlich constant kf and exponent n are calculated from the intercept and slope of the plot of ln qe vs ln ce

calculated from the plot of ln qe and ε2 ε polanyi potential rt ln 1 1 ce the suitability of the model was evaluated considering the linear isotherm models and coefficients of determination r2 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization 3 1 1 scanning electron microscopy sem sem images of pbl smcs beads crystal violet adsorbed pbl smcs beads cv pb smcs and tartrazine adsorbed pbl smcs beads tz pb smcs are shown in fig 3 a f edax mapping of the adsorbents is also shown graphically in fig 3 g i sem images illustrate that there is remarkable difference in surface morphologies of all the beads the difference can be easily seen in the low as well as in high resolution the differences in the surface morphologies are due to the adsorption of dye molecules on the surface of pbl smcs beads as it is shown in fig 3 b c sem images of pbl smcs beads have shown the small structures which on the low resolution can be seen as smooth surface due to the seamless layer of pb2 over smcs beads on the other hand after cv and tz loading onto pbl smcs beads some rough circular and bigger structures can be seen over the smooth surface which we can speculate to be due to the adsorption of dye molecules edax images are shown to support the presence of dye molecules over pbl smcs beads in fig 3 g a large peak of lead is observed which shows 86 83 wt of lead the other two edax images of cv and tz loaded pbl smcs showed the presence of the elements of the respective dyes for instance fig 3 h shows the traces of chloride which is coming from the cv and fig 3 i confirms the presence of sulfur and sodium from tz 3 1 2 ftir spectroscopy ftir spectroscopy was done to assess the functional groups present in the composites of smcs beads before and after adsorption of pb2 as well as after dye adsorption the presence of functional groups plays an important role in adsorption of adsorbate onto adsorbent 26 the characteristic peaks in the range of 600 750 cm 1 revealed the presence of sulphate groups in smcs pbl smcs cv pbl smcs and tz pbl smcs beads the bands in the region of 800 cm 1 may be assigned to mono substituted aromatic rings the peaks observed in the 1102 1200 cm 1 range may be explained by the presence of coc stretching of ether 5 the peaks at 1639 cm 1 indicate the presence of bending vibration of hydroxyl groups of water which involves in the formation of hydrogen bonds and the peak at 1398 cm 1 may be assigned to the bending vibration of ch2 in smcs beads the peak at 1639 cm 1 is less intense in other three curves such as pbl smcs cv pb smcs and tz pb smcs beads peaks at 1591 cm 1 and 1530 cm 1 is assigned to aromatic ring 27 which was absent in the smcs and pbl smcs beads we can say that these peaks were emerged due the cv and tz adsorption the peak at 2851 cm 1 corresponds to ch2 stretching of aliphatic groups 1 the broad peaks at 3406 cm 1 corresponds to the presence of oh group and primary and secondary amines 26 28 29 while the peaks around 2924 cm 1 could be ascribed to the asymmetric stretch of ch2 group 28 there was not much change observed in the peaks before and after adsorption few peaks emerged out due to aromatic rings and interaction of the dye with the pbl smcs beads after the adsorption of cv and tz confirm that chemical adsorption is also involved in the adsorption of cv and tz over pbl smcs beads fig 4 3 2 selection of dyes and adsorbent 3 2 1 preliminary comparison of cs smcs and pbl smcs beads for dye removal for preliminary studies the cs smcs and pbl smcs beads loaded with 100 mg g of pb2 were analyzed for the removal of two anionic dyes methyl orange mo and tz and two cationic dyes cv and mb the initial concentration of dyes was 50 mg l and the adsorbent dose was 0 45 g l the experiments were conducted under the controlled condition of 30 c and 100 rpm to provide better mixing of the dyes with the adsorbent it was found that the removal of cv and tz was better than two other tested dyes viz mb and mo in spite of the anionic nature of mo chitosan cs smcs and pbl smcs beads removed only 27 46 of the dye for mb also 7 33 43 59 and 57 93 removal was achieved by cs smcs and pbl smcs beads respectively therefore for further experiments cv cationic and tz anionic dyes were chosen it was also observed that pbl smcs beads were better adsorbent than the cs and smcs beads fig 5 this implied that the waste sludge of smcs beads after lead removal has the potential to remove dyes hence pbl smcs beads were chosen for further experiments in order to recycle and reuse them for cv and tz removal this may lead to waste minimization 3 3 parameter optimization for dye removal 3 3 1 effect of ph solution ph is an important parameter in case of dyes because with the change of solution ph their color and absorption maxima may vary thus it was felt pertinent to examine the effect of ph on the dye solutions without adsorbent 30 for this particular study dye solutions 20 mg l were prepared at different ph and spectrophotometric analysis was done to observe any changes either in the λmax and or in the absorbance value it was observed that increase in the ph of the dye solutions without adding the adsorbent also causes in the decrease of the absorbance value fig 6 a b this condition puts the restriction of doing the adsorption experiments at extreme basic ph conditions the range of ph where the cv and tz absorbance was stable was 4 0 6 0 and 2 0 7 0 respectively the ph of the dyes was maintained accordingly the variation of ph from 3 0 to 10 0 was made to see its effect on the removal of both the dyes the ph was adjusted using 1 n hno3 and 1 n naoh the resulted graph fig 6 c shows that increase in ph of cv did not show much difference in removal as it can be seen in the graph that upon increasing ph from 3 to 10 the removal obtained was 88 91 with the maximum removal at ph 6 0 hence for further experiments the ph of cv solution was maintained at 6 0 unlike cv the variation of solution ph showed significant difference in the removal efficiency of tz it is also clear from fig 6 c that the removal of tz decreased from 80 to 50 upon increasing the ph from 3 0 to 10 0 the ph of the tz solution for further experiments was maintained at 3 0 to get the maximum removal for evaluating the effect of ph the concentration of dyes was taken as 20 mg l with the dose of 0 9 g l keeping batch volume as 5 0 ml all the experiments were done in the incubator shaker at 100 rpm and 30 c 3 3 2 effect of dose adsorbent dose is the amount of adsorbent used for the removal of particular concentration of the adsorbate adsorbent has particular number of adsorption sites for fixed amount of adsorbate increase in dose provides the larger number of sites which in turn increases the removal efficiency of the adsorbate the influence of the dose of pbl smcs beads on cv and tz removal was studied at the dye solution ph of 6 0 and 3 0 respectively with an agitation speed of 100 rpm at temperature 30 c obtained results are shown in fig 7 along with the photograph showing the change of dye color with the dose variation in this study the dose was varied in the range 0 18 1 35 g l concentration of cv and tz was selected as 20 mg l the removal of cv did not show any significant change with the increase in the dose for instance removal of cv was 87 89 at almost all the doses however the removal of tz increased from 45 74 to 90 at initial tz concentration of 20 mg l with an increase in the dose of pbl smcs beads from 0 18 to 1 35 g l it is worthy to note that the dose of 0 72 g l was sufficient to get 90 removal beyond this dose there was not much change in the removal of tz on the other hand 0 18 g l adsorbent dose was sufficient to attain 87 60 removal of cv the results are in accordance with the various reported researches based on the chitosan biosorbents 20 28 higher adsorbent dosage resulted in the decreased adsorption capacity due to the fact that there was significant unsaturation of adsorption active sites at fixed dye concentration 31 32 this is also supported by the study of klett et al 33 which shows the decrease in adsorption capacity upon increasing the adsorbent dose of nickel doped zinc oxide ni0 05zn0 95o nanoparticles for the removal of mo and tz 33 3 3 3 effect of initial adsorbate concentration the effect of initial dye concentration in the range of 5 100 mg l cv and tz was studied while the agitation speed of 100 rpm for 2 h was maintained the ph of the medium was maintained as 6 0 and 3 0for cv and tz respectively the graph obtained by plotting the data is shown in fig 8 a it is observed that as the initial dye concentration was increased from 5 to 100 mg l the percentage removal of cv as well as tz gradually decreased it is shown in fig 8 a that cv removal decreased from 87 03 to 31 33 whereas tz removal decreased from 84 61 to 41 28 as the initial dye concentration was increased from 5 to 100 mg l this is due to the fact that while keeping the adsorbent dose fixed with the increase of dye concentration the relative number of cites decreases in order to check the reproducibility of the results three replicate batch studies were conducted at varying concentrations ranging from 5 to 100 mg l at the equilibrium time of 2 h with the dose of 0 36 and 0 72 for cv and tz respectively agitation speed of 120 rpm was maintained at the temperature of 30 c the standard deviation sd and standard error std error calculation shows that the sd varies in the range from 1 13 to 5 12 for cv and 0 97 7 3 for tz fig 8b 3 3 4 kinetics and order of reaction the time required to attain the equilibrium for the dye adsorption was evaluated with the adsorbent pbl smcs beads the initial concentration of cv and tz dye was chosen as 20 mg l and the adsorbent dose was fixed at 0 72 g l keeping other parameters same agitation speed was maintained as 100 rpm at the temperature of 30 c the time varied for the kinetic study was 5 min to 24 h the effect of contact time on cv and tz removal r and capacity mg g by pbl smcs beads is shown in fig 9 a the figure clearly shows that with increase in time from 5 min to 120 min there is sharp increase in the percent removal of adsorbate when there is concentration gradient between adsorbate present in the solution and the adsorbent 34 in 120 min the removal obtained was 85 44 and 82 75 for cv and tz respectively after 2 h when the contact time was further increased up to 24 h there was no significant increase in the removal of dyes hence equilibrium time chosen for further studies was 2 h kinetic data obtained was applied to the pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetic models it was found that the data complied with the pseudo second order model with the equilibrium adsorption capacity of 25 25 mg g for cv and 29 76 mg g for tz table 2 the pseudo second order plots for both the dyes are shown in fig 9 b the r2 values obtained for cv and tz was 0 994 and 0 999 respectively table 2 which indicated that the adsorption process followed pseudo second order model for both the dyes the kinetic results also indicate that the adsorption of cv and tz on to pbl smcs beads is chemical in nature fig 9 c shows the theoretical and experimental curve fitting for adsorption capacity 3 3 5 effect of agitation speed the effect of agitation speed on the adsorption of cv and tz onto pbl smcs beads was studied fig 10 shows that the sorption amount of cv increased significantly with increase in the agitation speed from 0 to 180 rpm on the contrary the tz removal was reduced upon increasing the agitation speed from 120 to 180 rpm the reason for increase in the cv adsorption upon increasing the agitation may be the increase in the movement of the dye molecules which also increases the conatct between the adsorbate and adsorbent the adsorption occurred on the surface of the adsorbent up on crossing the barrier offered by bulk particles in the solution and the boundary layer of the adsorbent this resulted in the diffusion of the adsorbate molecules in to the bulk of the adsorbent 35 36 on the other hand tz removal was decreased from 77 to 60 as the agitation rate was increased beyond 120 rpm it is depicted in the figure that 100 and 120 rpm is suitable for the tz removal there is no significant difference in removal at 100 and 120 rpm in both the cases for cv as well as tz cv removal was 78 93 and tz removal was 77 80 at 120 rpm decrease in tz removal upon increasing the rpm may be due to the increase in randomness of the particles which lead to the movement of tz molecules away from the adsorbent surface it may be possible that due to the physical adsorption of the tz molecules increase in agitation speed results in detaching the loosely bound molecules from the surface of pbl smcs beads on the basis of the above results it can be concluded that the adsorption of cv and tz on pbl smcs beads is dependent on the agitation speed 7 3 4 thermodynamic study the effect of temperature on the removal of cv and tz by pbl smcs was studied in the temperature range of 30 50 c and the other thermodynamic parameters were calculated concentration of the dyes was fixed at 20 mg l and the equilibrium time 2 h agitation speed was maintained at 120 rpm it was observed that the temperature had positive effect on the removal efficiency of pbl smcs beads for both cv and tz upon increasing the temperature from 30 to 50 c there was increment in the removal from 87 79 to 93 41 for cv and 58 to 70 in case of tz fig 11 a shows the graph plotted between the concentrations of dyes left after adsorption by pbl smcs beads at varying temperatures similar results were also obtained by liang et al 37 there it has been suggested that with increase in the temperature there is more energy available for adsorbate to move towards the adsorbent surface 37 the experiment was done to analyze the effect of temperature and on the basis of obtained data thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy change δh entropy change δs and gibbs free energy change δg were calculated thermodynamic parameters are as important as the other parameters optimization for an adsorption system to gain an insight into the adsorption process various thermodynamic parameters were calculated by the slope and intercept of van t hoff plot fig 11 b total heat of the system or internal energy of the system is measured by enthalpy and degree of randomness of the system is measured by entropy 38 39 when the system is kept isolated without transfer of heat from the environment to the system entropy is considered to be the driving force for adsorption 5 30 40 41 thermodynamic parameters were computed using eqs 3 5 and the van t hoff plot of ln ke vs 1 t fig 11 b 3 l n k e δ s r δ h r t 4 k e c 0 c e c e 5 δ g r t ln k e where c0 and ce mg l is the initial and equilibrium dye concentration in the solution ke the equilibrium constant or distribution coefficient δs is the entropy change j mol k δh is the enthalpy change kj mol δg is the gibb s free energy change kj mol for the system r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k and t is the temperature of the solution k the gibbs free energy obtained for the cv and tz adsorption at different temperatures was negative which indicates that the adsorption is spontaneous and favorable highest negative value 7 12 kj mol for δg is obtained at 323 k table 3 which implies that the adsorption process is energetically more favored at higher temperature 42 43 due to the more interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent 41 44 positive value of δs indicates the increased randomness of the system positive value of change in enthalpy δh specifies that the adsorption process is endothermic 45 δh values for cv and tz adsorption onto pbl smcs beads were found to be 27 82 and 16 47 kj mol respectively which reveals the chemical adsorption 46 it is common in most of the adsorption processes on the basis of the parameters we can conclude that the adsorption of cv and tz over pbl smcs beads is favorable and spontaneous 3 5 equilibrium isotherm study isotherm gives the idea about the distribution of adsorbate in solution phase and in the adsorption phase under the equilibrium condition in order to understand the adsorption process in further details the isotherm data were fitted to various isotherm models and on the basis of r2 values it was assumed which isotherm was best followed 3 19 20 25 different isotherm models have different assumptions on the basis of the mechanism involved in the adsorption process for instance monolayer sorption with a finite number of active sites on the adsorbent is one of the assumptions of the langmuir adsorption isotherm 22 freundlich isotherm describes the heterogeneous layer or multilayer formation on the surface of adsorbent because of non uniform distribution of heat of adsorption over the surface 23 temkin isotherm gives the idea about the adsorbate adsorbent interaction by the factor which describes that the heat of adsorption of all the molecules in the layer decreases linearly with the adsorbent adsorbate interactions d r isotherm model was usually applied to distinguish the physical and chemical adsorption with its mean free energy which is denoted by e e 1 2 b d for isotherm study of cv and tz the concentration was varied from 5 to 100 mg l the dose was selected as 0 36 and 0 72 g l for cv and tz respectively the experiments were done in the incubator shaker keeping rpm fixed as 100 and temperature at 30 c the contact time was 2 h calculated values of langmuir freundlich temkin and d r constants for cv and tz are compiled in table 4 the linear plots of all the applied models are shown in fig 12 a d on the basis of the values of coefficient of determination r2 it can be assumed that the adsorption of cv onto pbl smcs beads followed langmuir isotherm while that for tz followed freundlich model table 4 this variation may be due to the different size and chemical structure of the adsorbate molecules causing different affinities towards pbl smcs beads 4 performance evaluation results obtained from some of the reported researches for the removal of cv and tz using different adsorbents have been summarized in table 5 and the adsorption capacities of different adsorbents are compared with that obtained for pbl smcs beads the results show that pbl smcs beads are potential adsorbent for cv and tz removal from water medium 5 conclusions the present study focuses on the utilization of waste beads generated after the adsorptive removal of lead from aqueous solution removal of pb2 was done by applying the adsorbent prepared by sds modification of chitosan cs beads the surfactant was used in the concentration cmc which was believed to form bilayer over the cs surface under controlled conditions after adsorption of pb2 the beads which were designated as pbl smcs beads were used to remove the anionic as well as cationic dye viz tartrazine tz and crystal violet cv it was found that pbl smcs beads were able to remove both the dyes well the confirmation of the cv and tz adsorption onto pbl smcs was done by sem edax and ftir analysis the optimum ph for cv removal was 6 6 5 and that for tz was 3 3 5 equilibrium time for removal of cv and tz was 2 h cv and tz adsorption onto pbl smcs beads was the function of time agitation speed and temperature cv and tz removal onto pbl smcs followed langmuir and freundlich isotherms respectively langmuir adsorption capacity obtained for cv and tz removal was 97 09 and 30 03 mg g adsorption process followed pseudo second order model thermodynamic data showed that the adsorption process of cv and tz onto pbl smcs beads was energetically and entropically favorable and spontaneous exact mechanism of the adsorption of cv and tz onto pbl smcs beads was not known the interesting part of this work is that smcs beads after the removal of pb2 3 could besuccessfully utilized for the removal of cv and tz the approach of this study is new and it can be a good example of recycling of waste sludge the present work may satisfy the concept of waste recycling and reuse or closed loop system in industrial ecology acknowledgement the authors are thankful to iit kharagpur india for providing facilities and financial support to carry out this

14366,temperature is known to influence the filtration performance of membrane systems through its direct impact on water viscosity this research demonstrates that the changes in natural organic matter nom fouling behavior with temperature are over and beyond simple viscosity changes in water constant flux experiments were performed in a tubular ceramic ultrafiltration uf system at 5 20 and 35 c the unified membrane fouling index umfi was used to identify nom reversible and irreversible fouling mechanisms while the modified uf fouling index mfi uf was used to predict the fouling potential of nom the results showed that after correcting for viscosity to standard 20 c compared to 5 c umfi values were higher than expected and reflected the higher fouling irreversibility observed at the lower temperature the lower water temperature resulted in an increase in nom retention along with decrease in backwash and chemical cleaning effectiveness as determined by the umfi and feem analyses however increased water temperature did not adversely impact existing backwash or chemical cleaning protocols in addition the mfi uf exhibited the same trend as umfi for establishing nom fouling and retention and therefore the mfi uf method is suitable for use as fouling predictor with ceramic membrane systems keywords ceramic ultrafiltration fouling indices irreversible fouling temperature 1 introduction ceramic membranes are drawing increasing attention in drinking water treatment sectors as a cost competitive alternative to polymeric membranes 1 3 this emerging technology takes advantage of superior chemical resistance that enables aggressive chemical cleaning and structural rigidity that alleviates problems associated with repetitive testing repair and replacement however similar to polymerics ceramic membranes face several challenging issues the most important of these is loss of flux due to irreversible fouling by nom such as humic protein and polysaccharide substances which can degrade their performance as well as decrease longevity 4 7 many factors including raw water characteristics operational and environmental conditions i e water temperature and ph can negatively impact membrane performance and fouling 2 4 among these factors feed water temperature is an important operating parameter that has effects on membrane filtration due to the nature of seasonal changes in the temperature of raw water temperature has a direct impact on water density and viscosity which influence membrane flux however the effect of temperature on water properties is not sufficient to fully explain the drop in membrane flux and permeability and often overlooked in the study of membrane fouling previous studies addressing the impacts of feed water temperature with membranes were commonly done with high pressure nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro membrane systems 8 10 or membrane bio reactor mbr systems 11 12 and more focused on inorganic scaling and biofouling challenges with operation at temperatures greater than 20 c but not changes in reversible and irreversible nom fouling behavior in fact limited studies exist that examine the impact of temperature below 20 c with low pressure membranes 13 15 farahbakhsh et al 15 found that current standards for membrane integrity testing overestimated safety design values by not taking into account temperatures below 5 c thus thousands of dollars are wasted each year in membrane filtration plants to replace damaged membranes because the negative effects of cold water on membrane performance and fouling are often overlooked 5 despite some studies that have showed the effect of different temperatures on membrane performance and permeability 13 15 to our best knowledge no attention has been paid to the impacts on reversible and irreversible nom fouling and cleaning mechanisms of low pressure membranes in addition while previous studies on temperature impact were focused on polymeric membranes the emerging market of ceramic membranes for drinking water has received little attention in this area but is important for their implementation for drinking water treatment applications from a water quality testing perspective fouling index methods are commonly used to quickly assess the fouling tendency of membrane feed water at the design stage and or pretreatment requirements the silt density index sdi and modified fouling index mfi using a 0 45 μm membrane are commonly utilized as fouling predictors and for quality control during membrane operation 16 17 boerlage et al 18 developed the mfi uf making use of a 13 kda hollow fiber ultrafiltration uf membrane to count for particles 0 45 μm feed water having an mfi uf 3000 s l2 is equivalent to sdi 3 min which is considered acceptable for membrane feed to control fouling 18 a number of studies applied the mfi uf for assessing the fouling propensity with ro membrane systems 19 21 these studies have focused on particulate inorganic scaling and biofouling with ro systems furthermore in these studies flat sheet uf membranes were used for the mfi uf testing instead of hollow fiber membranes in fact the usability of the mfi uf with the hollow fiber membrane method for nom fouling under changes in water temperature conditions and its applicability with ceramic membranes has yet to be examined the unified membrane fouling index umfi model 22 is commonly used to quantify fouling based on reversibility and irreversibility components thus unlike the mfi uf the umfi provides information on the current fouling a membrane is subjected to i e reversible vs irreversible however the actual capacity of the mfi uf and umfi to be effectively used as fouling assessment methods with ceramic membranes has yet to be evaluated in general and under changing water temperature conditions limited studies exist that address the impact of seasonal variations of water temperature on fouling and cleaning of ceramic uf membranes more specifically the changes in reversible and irreversible nom fouling ratios with temperature need to be clarified to understand potential changes in backwash and chemical cleaning regimes in membrane systems to help maintain membrane productivity thus the aim of this paper is to examine the filtration performance nom fouling and cleaning of a ceramic uf membrane a cross a range of feed water temperature 5 35 c the umfi method was applied to assess for respective changes in reversible and irreversible fouling under changing water temperature conditions further the mfi uf method was evaluated for its prediction capacity on nom fouling mechanisms with temperature for the ceramic uf system 2 materials and methods 2 1 feed water solution a synthetic feed water solution comprised of a mixture of three different nom components humic substance humic acids protein bovine serum albumin bsa and polysaccharide sodium alginate was used for this study these nom model components are commonly found in surface water and have been previously used in membrane fouling studies 4 6 7 the total organic carbon toc concentration in the feed water was 2 5 mg c l i e 0 83 mg c l each nom model and was chosen to simulate the organic matter content in surface water 4 a moderate hardness of 75 mg l calcium carbonate caco3 and a low level of turbidity 5 ntu as kaolin clay particles were included in the synthetic water matric to represent the more complex conditions of a surface water source 2 23 all chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich feed water solutions were prepared in di water and were mixed using a magnetic stirrer one day prior any experiment to ensure that materials were dissolved completely feed water was continuously mixed using a vwr dual speed mixer to ensure homogeneous water conditions throughout the experiment the ph of the feed was adjusted as needed to 7 5 with naoh 2 2 ceramic uf experiments 2 2 1 fouling experiments assays were

created to operate the system automatically such as controlling the feed pump to have a constant flux and automatically switches from filtration cycles to backwash cycles while recording flux and pressure data 24 a tubular ceramic uf membrane ceramem veolia was used and its characteristics are as follows monolithic module silicon carbide sic membrane material inside out channels 61 square channel 2 mm pore size 0 01 μm area 0 1 m2 and module length 300 mm the ceramic membrane was fouled for 24 h in dead end filtration mode under constant flux of 100 lmh backwashes were conducted for 20 s every 4 h 0 4 m3 m2 using pressurized di water at 2 bars 30 psig at room temperature 24 to assess the potential seasonal impacts of water temperature on ceramic uf fouling and cleaning feed water temperature was assessed at 5 20 and 35 ⁰c temperature was controlled either using an immersion heater cole palmer or a compact chiller lm series polyscience the feed tank was insulated to maintain constant temperature throughout the testing period temperature were monitored using hach temperature probe cat no 58258 00 hqd field case equipment eq 1 25 was used to correct flux measured at different temperature to standard temperature of 20 c experiments were performed in triplicates for each testing condition 1 j 20 ⁰ c j m 1 03 t 20 ⁰ c t m j20 c and t20 c are the flux and temperature at 20 c respectively jm and tm are the measured flux and temperature respectively 2 2 2 chemical cleaning after the last filtration cycle the ceramic uf was backwashed followed by chemical cleaning clean in place cip the cip was performed according to the manufacturer recommendations using an oxidant sodium hypochlorite naocl 500 mg cl2 l followed by citric acid 1 each cleaning step was performed for 4 h cip wash water chemicals were prepared in 4 l of di water and were recirculated for 1 h followed by 3 h soak a clean water flux cwf test was then performed to determine the initial membrane resistance using the tmp versus flux relationship for a clean membrane 2 3 analysis 2 3 1 the unified membrane fouling index umfi to assess ceramic membrane fouling and cleaning performance the umfi model eq 2 22 was applied to quantify each contributing fouling resistance 2 1 j s 1 u m f i x v s where js is the normalized specific flux i e measured specific flux js divided by initial specific flux js0 unitless umfi is an estimate of the extent of fouling m 1 and vs m3 m2 is the specific permeate volume total fouling index umfif was calculated by using data from the entire filtration cycle i e using the slope of the linear region of 1 js versus vs graph from the start to end of filtration using the procedure described in greater detail by huang et al 22 hydraulically irreversible fouling index umfihir was calculated using the slope of the 1 js versus vs graph after the hydraulic backwash whereas chemically irreversible fouling index umficir was calculated using the slope of the 1 js versus vs graph after the cip procedures using eq 2 22 hydraulically reversible fouling index umfihr that was removed by backwash was calculated from the difference between umfif and umfihir chemically reversible fouling index umficr that was removed by chemical cleaning was calculated from the difference between umfihir and umficir consequently umfif was fractionated to reversible and irreversible fouling as described in eq 3 3 2 3 2 specific cake resistance the intrinsic resistance rm of a clean membrane was determined by filtering di water through the ceramic membrane at a low flux j and after recording the pressure δp0 for 30 min the flux was increased and the procedure continued in a stepwise fashion eq 4 was used to estimate rm μ is the water viscosity

μ c b v s α c 2 3 3 carbon and fluorescence excitation and emission matrix feem analyses a carbon mass balance was performed to determine indirectly the carbon mass remaining on the membrane before and after backwashing and chemical cleaning this was done by performing total organic carbon toc analysis using a shimadzu toc vcph cpn analyzer on samples from feed permeate hydraulic backwash and chemical wash waters for each backwash cycle 500 ml of di water was used to backwash the membrane total backwash water volume was 3 l 6 backwash cycles experiment the mass of hydraulically irreversible carbon chir which refer to the foulants remained on the membrane after filtration and before chemical cleaning was determined using eq 8 the chir was further divided into chemically reversible ccr and irreversible ccir which refer to the carbon mass removed by chemical cleaning and carbon mass remained on the membrane after chemical cleaning respectively as shown in eq 9 8 chir cf cp chr 9 chir ccr ccir f p hr hir cr and cir denote feed water permeate hydraulically reversible hydraulically irreversible chemically reversible and chemically irreversible respectively carbon data was then compared to the fouling indices data estimated by the umfi method additionally feem analysis using cary eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer varian surrey uk was performed on water samples from feed permeate backwash and chemical wash waters for qualitative insights into nom fouling and cleaning at different temperature conditions examined prior to feem analysis calcium and kaolin clay particles were removed by filtering the analyzed sample through a 0 45 μm filter 95 of calcium and kaolin clay particles in the 20 50 μm and 2 5 μm range respectively furthermore a feem spectra of a blank was determined then the feem spectra of the analyzed sample was subtracted by the blank spectra to obtain the feem peaks of organics in the water sample the feem peaks was determined by scanning the excitation wavelengths from 250 to 350 nm in 2 nm steps and detecting the emission intensity in 10 nm steps between 250 and 600 nm excitation and emission slit widths were 5 nm each measurement was carried out in standard quartz cuvette 1 0 cm path length 2 3 4 mfi uf fouling index fouling potential of the nom mixture solution from the ceramic uf membrane experiments was assessed using the mfi uf method 18 the mfi uf setup consisted of a digital gear pump cole parmer drive no 75211 30 head no 07003 04 a ball valve cole parmer no 01377 18 a pressure relief valve aquatrol no 3etu4 and a pressure regulator with gauge veolia no la512 a hollow fiber polymeric uf membrane was used for the mfi uf testing proposed by boerlage et al 18 with the following characteristics molecular weight cut off 13 kda membrane materials pan inside out fiber inside diameter 0 8 mm fiber outside diameter 1 4 mm number of fibers 400 membrane area 0 2 m2 module length 347 mm module diameter 42 mm mfi uf testing was determined by filtering feed water through the hollow fiber uf membrane under dead end mode and constant pressure of 2 bars permeate water was collected in a tank set on an electronic balance adam equipment nbl8201e which has an rs 232 interface with a computer in order to acquire permeate volume v and filtration time t data from the balance data were recorded every 1 min and imported into ms excel spread sheet with data terminal software teraterm 28 the mfi uf was then calculated using eq 10 rewritten in eq 11 18 where t is the filtration time s v

test were performed under 5 20 and 35 c water temperature 10 t v μ r m δ p a μ c b α c 2 δ p a 2 v μ r m δ p a m f i u f v which can be rewritten as 11 m f i u f μ c b α c 2 δ p a 2 d t v d v 2 3 5 statistical analysis fouling and cleaning data obtained at different water temperature conditions were analyzed with the statistical program spss 22 0 one way anova using the f test was performed on the data collected the mean difference between conditions was considered to be significant at a p value of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of feed water temperature on ceramic uf fouling fig 2 illustrates the effect of water temperature variation on ceramic uf fouling the data shown in fig 2a and b are the experimental umfif umfif exp which represents the fouling index at temperature t and the normalized umfif umfif nor which represents the fouling index normalized to 20 c to account for changes in water viscosity using eq 1 respectively therefore the difference in umfif nor values at different temperature is due to fouling it can be clearly seen that with decreasing water temperature from 20 c to 5 c the umfif exp of the nom mixture fig 2a increased from 0 69 to 1 25 m 1 while umfif exp decreased from 0 69 to 0 46 m 1 when the temperature increased from 20 c to 35 c according to darcy s law the flux is a function of filtration pressure membrane resistance and the viscosity of water therefore water temperature has a great effect on flux because as both the membrane resistance and viscosity are temperature dependent 25 the increase in umfif exp with decreasing temperature at constant flux filtration could be partially attributed to the increase in solution viscosity combined with increase in resistance of the membrane material which then resulted in higher umfif exp value 5 29 however fig 2b shows that the changes in nom fouling with temperature are over and beyond simple viscosity changes of water the umfif nor values i e after correcting for viscosity showed that at 5 c the fouling index was 1 05 m 1 which was significantly higher than that at 20 c umfif nor of 0 69 m 1 p 0 05 while the umfif nor value at 35 c decreased to 0 60 m 1 therefore the increase or decrease in the umfif exp values with temperature was not solely attributed to changes in water viscosity fig 3 shows the changes in the umfi values due to viscosity changes versus fouling with temperature the umfif nor values showed that at 5 c only 43 of the increased in fouling index was attributed to the high viscosity of water whereas 57 was due to fouling also at 35 c 64 of the decreased in fouling index was attributed to the low viscosity of water whereas 36 was due to fouling thus it is evident that the increase or decrease in the umfi with temperature is due to changes in fouling behavior of nom combined with changes in water viscosity additionally table 1 shows that the specific cake resistance αc value of the nom mixture increased as feed water temperature decreased from 35 c to 5 c the higher αc value at 5 c indicates an increase in foulant deposition on the ceramic membrane and the production of a cake layer with lower permeability and higher fouling resistance the percentage nom retained by the ceramic uf increased from 62 to 88 p 0 05 with decreasing temperature from 35 c to 5 c refer to table 1 and consistent with the αc findings the increase in nom retention at lower temperature could be attributed to the changes in the fouling layer formed on the membrane and increase in nom size thus more nom were retained by the ceramic uf membrane and higher fouling occurred cui et al 5 study reported a decrease in polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane diameter and membrane permeability and an increase in the intrinsic hydraulic resistance were observed for a membrane operated at cold water temperature 0 3 c similarly jin et al 10 reported higher nom capture with ro systems in which the size of humic acid increased with decreasing water temperature therefore temperature has an impact on both membrane properties and foulants feem analysis fig 4 was used to analyze samples from the ceramic uf permeate water at two different temperature conditions 5 c and 20 c the feem analysis were used to provide qualitative information on nom retention with temperature higher feem intensities indicate more nom in the water thus lower permeate quality the fluorescence peaks for humic like substances are reported from 250 to 390 nm range of excitation and between 400 500 nm range of emission the fluorescence peaks for protein polysaccharides like substances are from 230 to 290 nm range of excitation and between 300 360 nm range of emission 30 in fig 4 the fluorescence intensities peaks of the nom mixture permeate water at 5 c were 18 2 au for humic acid and 21 7 au for proteins alginate at 20 c the feem intensities for humic acid in the permeate water increased to 25 6 au whereas much higher protein alginate substances were found in the permeate water 38 6 au indicating lower nom retention at 20 c compared to 5 c van den brink et al 12 study with mbr systems found that with decreasing temperature a shift was found in polysaccharides particle size distribution which led to high retention and fast pore blocking thus higher fouling at lower temperature the feem results correlate well with the umfif values fig 3 and nom retention data table 1 demonstrating the effect of temperature on nom retention by the ceramic uf membrane and the quality of permeate water 3 2 impact of feed water temperature on backwash and chemical cleaning effectiveness the overall umfi analysis showed an impact of water temperature on nom fouling this can be further categorized by the reversible and irreversible fouling fractions to help assess backwash and chemical cleaning effectiveness fig 5 demonstrates that with decreasing temperature from 20 c to 5 c the hydraulically irreversible fouling index umfihir increased by 35 p 0 05 whereas the umfihir decreased by 15 p 0 05 with increasing temperature from 20 c to 35 c thus the increase in nom fouling at lower temperature was due to the higher irreversible accumulation of nom which resisted hydraulic backwashes that is the temperature drop not only increases fouling due to hydraulic resistance with the increased water viscosity but also the very nature of the nom alters with the drop in water temperature and some fraction of the nom shifts from reversible at 20 c to irreversible at 5 c this is reflected in the hydraulically reversible fouling index umfihr data in which the backwash efficiency was lower at 5 c and increased as temperature increased from 5 c to 20 c the chemically irreversible fouling index umficir was the highest at 5 c indicating lower chemical cleaning efficiency at the lower temperature irreversibility of the foulant layer is a major concern during membrane filtration as it influences physical and chemical cleaning requirements the significant amount of hydraulically and chemically irreversible fouling at 5 c pose a potential limitation to longer membrane operation fig 6 shows the hydraulically reversible to irreversible fouling ratios umfihr umfihir and carbon ratios chr chir at different temperature with decreasing water temperature from 20 c to 5 c the umfihr umfihir ratio of the nom mixture decreased from 0 62 to 0 35 p 0 05 the decreased in the umfihr umfihir at lower temperature indicated lower hydraulic backwash efficiency thus higher nom hydraulically irreversible fouling this can be supported by the carbon data in which the chr chir ratio decreased from 0 45 to 0 31 with decreasing temperature from 20 c to 5 c thus the backwash pressure applied to mitigate fouling at standard feed water temperature of 20 c was not sufficient in removing nom fouling deposits at 5 c this is consistent with the increase in specific cake resistance and nom retention values at lower temperature refer to table 1 the umfihr umfihir and chr chir ratios at 35 c increased to 0 71 and 0 66 respectively indicating more effective backwash at higher temperature this could be partially attributed to the lower cake resistance and nom retention at 35 c refer to table 1 hence better cleaning the results from the umfi analysis can be supported by the feem plots of the nom mixture backwash water fig 7 at 20 c the fluorescence intensities peaks for humic acid and proteins alginate were 27 6 au and 37 1 au respectively while at 5 c the fluorescence intensities peaks for humic acid in the backwash water was 24 2 au and surprisingly no proteins alginate were found in the backwash water at 5 c by comparing the feem plots of the permeate water fig 4 and the backwash water fig 7 at 5 c it is clear that proteins alginate substances resisted hydraulic backwash and caused irreversible fouling for the ceramic uf ma et al 11 and van den brink et al 12 studies found that lower temperature had negative impacts on proteins and polysaccharides substances and biofouling in mbr systems therefore both proteins and polysaccharides are problematic for membrane systems and more impacted by water temperature condition than humic substances the feem plots correlate well with the umfihr umfihir ratios fig 6 demonstrating the effect of temperature on the nom reversibility and irreversibility therefore it is recommended to alter membrane backwash procedure with temperature i e by increasing backwash pressure frequency etc to control membrane fouling fig 8 shows the chemical cleaning cip efficiency at different feed water temperature conditions the umficr umfihir and ccr chir ratios under the operation at 5 c was 0 78 and 0 58 respectively while the ratios at 20 c were significantly higher 0 92 and 0 81 respectively p 0 05 thus chemical cleaning was not effective in removing irreversible fouling at 5 c whereas at 20 c the foulants were effectively removed the decrease in the cleaning efficiency at 5 c is attributed to the high irreversible fouling refer to fig 5 at 35 c cleaning of the ceramic membrane was easier than 5 c and 20 c conditions resulting in higher umficr umfihir and ccr chir ratios of 0 96 and 0 87 respectively feem plots of the naocl chemical wash water fig 9 were used to qualitatively assess the cleaning efficiency at different temperature at 5 c condition higher intensities of humic acid 32 6 au but much lower intensities for bsa alginate 18 4 au feem intensities at 20 c for humic acid was 29 8 au which was approximately similar to that at 5 c while much higher feem intensities for bsa alginate 38 1 au these results indicate that the lower cleaning efficiency at 5 c is attributed to the higher irreversible mass of bsa alginate in the nom mixture solution therefore alteration of membrane chemical cleaning procedure at lower temperature is recommended to control chemically irreversible fouling and achieve higher permeability recovery chemical cleaning procedure was effective at both 20 c and 35 c p 0 05 refer to fig 8 indicating that chemical cleaning procedure used at standard temperature 20 c should be sufficient at 35 c when needed 3 3 suitability of the mfi uf index for fouling prediction with ceramic membranes the mfi uf and umfi methods are used to evaluate membrane fouling however the different approaches in fouling assessment may suggest that direct comparison lack context the mfi uf provides an index value that indicates the fouling tendency of membrane feed whereas the umfi provides information on the current fouling a membrane is subjected to i e reversible vs irreversible however the actual capacity of the mfi uf to be used effectively as a prediction tool with nom fouling for ceramic membranes has yet to be evaluated in general and under changing water temperature conditions fig 10 shows the fouling index values fig 10a specific cake resistances fig 10b and nom retention fig 10c at different water temperature conditions as predicted by the mfi uf testing the mfi uf values and specific cake resistances were calculated following the procedure described in section 2 3 4 the results in fig 10a show that the mfi uf value of the nom mixture decreased significantly p 0 05 as the water temperature increased from 5 c to 35 c indicating lower fouling potential at higher temperature nom in cold water temperatures i e 5 c appears to have higher fouling potential mfi uf of 10 122 s l2 compared to that at warmer temperatures mfi uf of 6850 s l2 and 3774 s l2 for 20 c and 35 c respectively this could be a critical issue in assessing nom fouling specifically in regions where there is a large seasonal variation in water temperature as in north america and some parts of europe the decrease in water temperature caused changes to the cake layer that was formed and the amount of nom retained by the ceramic uf as shown in fig 10b and c the specific cake resistance αc was found to increase with decreasing temperature from 20 c to 5 c fig 10b along with an increase in nom retention fig 10c therefore the increase in the mfi uf value at the lower temperature was related to the impact of temperature on bsa and alginate size as shown in the feem images resulting in high nom retention by the uf membrane and an increase in specific cake resistance whereas at high temperature nom were passing through the uf membrane to the filtrate side thus lower fouling and mfi uf value variation in water temperature demonstrated an impact on both the fouling potential of nom mfi uf and fouling mechanism umfi fig 11 a shows that the mfi uf fouling prediction trend is in agreement with the fouling tendency observed using the umfi method moreover fig 11b and c show good correlations between specific cake resistance and nom retention values obtained in the mfi uf and ceramic uf systems thus the mfi uf testing method demonstrates a useful fit for predicting nom fouling and retention for ceramic membranes before relying on operating data i e umfi although there are differences in the numerical values of specific cake resistances and nom retentions which are attributed to the differences in membrane materials and characteristics the mfi uf is simple and short filtration test that can be used as a rapid assessment of nom fouling compared to the umfi analysis which normally requires long term filtration data thus a ceramic membrane plant could use the mfi uf in addition to the umfi to assess potential changes in nom fouling with temperature and make required alternations in membrane pretreatment and or cleaning procedures 4 conclusions this research investigated the impact of water temperature on nom fouling and cleaning of a tubular ceramic uf membrane using the umfi and mfi uf fouling index methods key findings were the effect of variation of feed water temperature on fouling of ceramic uf membranes was over and beyond simple viscosity changes of water the umfif and nom retention increased when the water temperature decreased from 35 c to 5 c due to changes in nom fouling behavior and specific fouling resistance thus fouling analysis performed at standard temperature 20 c will underestimate the impact of cold water condition on ceramic membranes performance the reversible and irreversible fouling ratio umfihr umfihir changed with temperature thus alteration of backwash procedure i e increase or decrease in backwash pressure with temperature is required to help control fouling and maintain membrane productivity feem analysis demonstrated higher levels of protein removal with backwashing at 20 c temperature versus 5 c and thus feem is useful in determining specific fouling components that can be addressed under site specific nom and temperature changes changes in nom fouling characteristics with temperature as predicted by the mfi uf method demonstrated useful fit with the umfi values and nom retention data obtained in the ceramic uf system thus the utilization of the mfi uf proved to be useful for assessing the potential changes in nom fouling behavior with temperature for ceramic membrane systems acknowledgements the

14366,temperature is known to influence the filtration performance of membrane systems through its direct impact on water viscosity this research demonstrates that the changes in natural organic matter nom fouling behavior with temperature are over and beyond simple viscosity changes in water constant flux experiments were performed in a tubular ceramic ultrafiltration uf system at 5 20 and 35 c the unified membrane fouling index umfi was used to identify nom reversible and irreversible fouling mechanisms while the modified uf fouling index mfi uf was used to predict the fouling potential of nom the results showed that after correcting for viscosity to standard 20 c compared to 5 c umfi values were higher than expected and reflected the higher fouling irreversibility observed at the lower temperature the lower water temperature resulted in an increase in nom retention along with decrease in backwash and chemical cleaning effectiveness as determined by the umfi and feem analyses however increased water temperature did not adversely impact existing backwash or chemical cleaning protocols in addition the mfi uf exhibited the same trend as umfi for establishing nom fouling and retention and therefore the mfi uf method is suitable for use as fouling predictor with ceramic membrane systems keywords ceramic ultrafiltration fouling indices irreversible fouling temperature 1 introduction ceramic membranes are drawing increasing attention in drinking water treatment sectors as a cost competitive alternative to polymeric membranes 1 3 this emerging technology takes advantage of superior chemical resistance that enables aggressive chemical cleaning and structural rigidity that alleviates problems associated with repetitive testing repair and replacement however similar to polymerics ceramic membranes face several challenging issues the most important of these is loss of flux due to irreversible fouling by nom such as humic protein and polysaccharide substances which can degrade their performance as well as decrease longevity 4 7 many factors including raw water characteristics operational and environmental conditions i e water temperature and ph can negatively impact membrane performance and fouling 2 4 among these factors feed water temperature is an important operating parameter that has effects on membrane filtration due to the nature of seasonal changes in the temperature of raw water temperature has a direct impact on water density and viscosity which influence membrane flux however the effect of temperature on water properties is not sufficient to fully explain the drop in membrane flux and permeability and often overlooked in the study of membrane fouling previous studies addressing the impacts of feed water temperature with membranes were commonly done with high pressure nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro membrane systems 8 10 or membrane bio reactor mbr systems 11 12 and more focused on inorganic scaling and biofouling challenges with operation at temperatures greater than 20 c but not changes in reversible and irreversible nom fouling behavior in fact limited studies exist that examine the impact of temperature below 20 c with low pressure membranes 13 15 farahbakhsh et al 15 found that current standards for membrane integrity testing overestimated safety design values by not taking into account temperatures below 5 c thus thousands of dollars are wasted each year in membrane filtration plants to replace damaged membranes because the negative effects of cold water on membrane performance and fouling are often overlooked 5 despite some studies that have showed the effect of different temperatures on membrane performance and permeability 13 15 to our best knowledge no attention has been paid to the impacts on reversible and irreversible nom fouling and cleaning mechanisms of low pressure membranes in addition while previous studies on temperature impact were focused on polymeric membranes the emerging market of ceramic membranes for drinking water has received little attention in this area but is important for their implementation for drinking water treatment applications from a water quality testing perspective fouling index methods are commonly used to quickly assess the fouling tendency of membrane feed water at the design stage and or pretreatment requirements the silt density index sdi and modified fouling index mfi using a 0 45 μm membrane are commonly utilized as fouling predictors and for quality control during membrane operation 16 17 boerlage et al 18 developed the mfi uf making use of a 13 kda hollow fiber ultrafiltration uf membrane to count for particles 0 45 μm feed water having an mfi uf 3000 s l2 is equivalent to sdi 3 min which is considered acceptable for membrane feed to control fouling 18 a number of studies applied the mfi uf for assessing the fouling propensity with ro membrane systems 19 21 these studies have focused on particulate inorganic scaling and biofouling with ro systems furthermore in these studies flat sheet uf membranes were used for the mfi uf testing instead of hollow fiber membranes in fact the usability of the mfi uf with the hollow fiber membrane method for nom fouling under changes in water temperature conditions and its applicability with ceramic membranes has yet to be examined the unified membrane fouling index umfi model 22 is commonly used to quantify fouling based on reversibility and irreversibility components thus unlike the mfi uf the umfi provides information on the current fouling a membrane is subjected to i e reversible vs irreversible however the actual capacity of the mfi uf and umfi to be effectively used as fouling assessment methods with ceramic membranes has yet to be evaluated in general and under changing water temperature conditions limited studies exist that address the impact of seasonal variations of water temperature on fouling and cleaning of ceramic uf membranes more specifically the changes in reversible and irreversible nom fouling ratios with temperature need to be clarified to understand potential changes in backwash and chemical cleaning regimes in membrane systems to help maintain membrane productivity thus the aim of this paper is to examine the filtration performance nom fouling and cleaning of a ceramic uf membrane a cross a range of feed water temperature 5 35 c the umfi method was applied to assess for respective changes in reversible and irreversible fouling under changing water temperature conditions further the mfi uf method was evaluated for its prediction capacity on nom fouling mechanisms with temperature for the ceramic uf system 2 materials and methods 2 1 feed water solution a synthetic feed water solution comprised of a mixture of three different nom components humic substance humic acids protein bovine serum albumin bsa and polysaccharide sodium alginate was used for this study these nom model

clean in place cip the cip was performed according to the manufacturer recommendations using an oxidant sodium hypochlorite naocl 500 mg cl2 l followed by citric acid 1 each cleaning step was performed for 4 h cip wash water chemicals were prepared in 4 l of di water and were recirculated for 1 h followed by 3 h soak a clean water flux cwf test was then performed to determine the initial membrane resistance using the tmp versus flux relationship for a clean membrane 2 3 analysis 2 3 1 the unified membrane fouling index umfi to assess ceramic membrane fouling and cleaning performance the umfi model eq 2 22 was applied to quantify each contributing fouling resistance 2 1 j s 1 u m f i x v s where js is the normalized specific flux i e measured specific flux js divided by initial specific flux js0 unitless umfi is an estimate of the extent of fouling m 1 and vs m3 m2 is the specific permeate volume total fouling index umfif was calculated by using data from the entire filtration cycle i e using the slope of the linear region of 1 js versus vs graph from the start to end of filtration using the procedure described in greater detail by huang et al 22 hydraulically irreversible fouling index umfihir was calculated using the slope of the 1 js versus vs graph after the hydraulic backwash whereas chemically irreversible fouling index umficir was calculated using the slope of the 1 js versus vs graph after the cip procedures using eq 2 22 hydraulically reversible fouling index umfihr that was removed by backwash was calculated from the difference between umfif and umfihir chemically reversible fouling index umficr that was removed by chemical cleaning was calculated from the difference between umfihir and umficir consequently umfif was fractionated to reversible and irreversible fouling as described in eq 3 3 2 3 2 specific cake resistance the intrinsic resistance rm of a clean membrane was determined by filtering di water through the ceramic membrane at a low flux j and after recording the pressure δp0 for 30 min the flux was increased and the procedure continued in a stepwise fashion eq 4 was used to estimate rm μ is the water viscosity

and after backwashing and chemical cleaning this was done by performing total organic carbon toc analysis using a shimadzu toc vcph cpn analyzer on samples from feed permeate hydraulic backwash and chemical wash waters for each backwash cycle 500 ml of di water was used to backwash the membrane total backwash water volume was 3 l 6 backwash cycles experiment the mass of hydraulically irreversible carbon chir which refer to the foulants remained on the membrane after filtration and before chemical cleaning was determined using eq 8 the chir was further divided into chemically reversible ccr and irreversible ccir which refer to the carbon mass removed by chemical cleaning and carbon mass remained on the membrane after chemical cleaning respectively as shown in eq 9 8 chir cf cp chr 9 chir ccr ccir f p hr hir cr and cir denote feed water permeate hydraulically reversible hydraulically irreversible chemically reversible and chemically irreversible respectively carbon data was then compared to the fouling indices data estimated by the umfi method additionally feem analysis using cary eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer varian surrey uk was performed on water samples from feed permeate backwash and chemical wash waters for qualitative insights into nom fouling and cleaning at different temperature conditions examined prior to feem analysis calcium and kaolin clay particles were removed by filtering the analyzed sample through a 0 45 μm filter 95 of calcium and kaolin clay particles in the 20 50 μm and 2 5 μm range respectively furthermore a feem spectra of a blank was determined then the feem spectra of the analyzed sample was subtracted by the blank spectra to obtain the feem peaks of organics in the water sample the feem peaks was determined by scanning the excitation wavelengths from 250 to 350 nm in 2 nm steps and detecting the emission intensity in 10 nm steps between 250 and 600 nm excitation and emission slit widths were 5 nm each measurement was carried out in standard quartz cuvette 1 0 cm path length 2 3 4 mfi uf fouling index fouling potential of the nom mixture solution from the ceramic uf membrane experiments was assessed using the mfi uf method 18 the mfi uf setup consisted of a digital gear pump cole parmer drive no 75211 30 head no 07003 04 a ball valve cole parmer no 01377 18 a pressure relief valve aquatrol no 3etu4 and a pressure regulator with gauge veolia no la512 a hollow fiber polymeric uf membrane was used for the mfi uf testing proposed by boerlage et al 18 with the following characteristics molecular weight cut off 13 kda membrane materials pan inside out fiber inside diameter 0 8 mm fiber outside diameter 1 4 mm number of fibers 400 membrane area 0 2 m2 module length 347 mm module diameter 42 mm mfi uf testing was determined by filtering feed water through the hollow fiber uf membrane under dead end mode and constant pressure of 2 bars permeate water was collected in a tank set on an electronic balance adam equipment nbl8201e which has an rs 232 interface with a computer in order to acquire permeate volume v and filtration time t data from the balance data were recorded every 1 min and imported into ms excel spread sheet with data terminal software teraterm 28 the mfi uf was then calculated using eq 10 rewritten in eq 11 18 where t is the filtration time s v

statistical analysis fouling and cleaning data obtained at different water temperature conditions were analyzed with the statistical program spss 22 0 one way anova using the f test was performed on the data collected the mean difference between conditions was considered to be significant at a p value of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of feed water temperature on ceramic uf fouling fig 2 illustrates the effect of water temperature variation on ceramic uf fouling the data shown in fig 2a and b are the experimental umfif umfif exp which represents the fouling index at temperature t and the normalized umfif umfif nor which represents the fouling index normalized to 20 c to account for changes in water viscosity using eq 1 respectively therefore the difference in umfif nor values at different temperature is due to fouling it can be clearly seen that with decreasing water temperature from 20 c to 5 c the umfif exp of the nom mixture fig 2a increased from 0 69 to 1 25 m 1 while umfif exp decreased from 0 69 to 0 46 m 1 when the temperature increased from 20 c to 35 c according to darcy s law the flux is a function of filtration pressure membrane resistance and the viscosity of water therefore water temperature has a great effect on flux because as both the membrane resistance and viscosity are temperature dependent 25 the increase in umfif exp with decreasing temperature at constant flux filtration could be partially attributed to the increase in solution viscosity combined with increase in resistance of the membrane material which then resulted in higher umfif exp value 5 29 however fig 2b shows that the changes in nom fouling with temperature are over and beyond simple viscosity changes of water the umfif nor values i e after correcting for viscosity showed that at 5 c the fouling index was 1 05 m 1 which was significantly higher than that at 20 c umfif nor of 0 69 m 1 p 0 05 while the umfif nor value at 35 c decreased to 0 60 m 1 therefore the increase or decrease in the umfif exp values with temperature was not solely attributed to changes in water viscosity fig 3 shows the changes in the umfi values due to viscosity changes versus fouling with temperature the umfif nor values showed that at 5 c only 43 of the increased in fouling index was attributed to the high viscosity of water whereas 57 was due to fouling also at 35 c 64 of the decreased in fouling index was attributed to the low viscosity of water whereas 36 was due to fouling thus it is evident that the increase or decrease in the umfi with temperature is due to changes in fouling behavior of nom combined with changes in water viscosity additionally table 1 shows that the specific cake resistance αc value of the nom mixture increased as feed water temperature decreased from 35 c to 5 c the higher αc value at 5 c indicates an increase in foulant deposition on the ceramic membrane and the production of a cake layer with lower permeability and higher fouling resistance the percentage nom retained by the ceramic uf increased from 62 to 88 p 0 05 with decreasing temperature from 35 c to 5 c refer to table 1 and consistent with the αc findings the increase in nom retention at lower temperature could be attributed to the changes in the fouling layer formed on the membrane and increase in nom size thus more nom were retained by the ceramic uf membrane and higher fouling occurred cui et al 5 study reported a decrease in polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane diameter and membrane permeability and an increase in the intrinsic hydraulic resistance were observed for a membrane operated at cold water temperature 0 3 c similarly jin et al 10 reported higher nom capture with ro systems in which the size of humic acid increased with decreasing water temperature therefore temperature has an impact on both membrane properties and foulants feem analysis fig 4 was used to analyze samples from the ceramic uf permeate water at two different temperature conditions 5 c and 20 c the feem analysis were used to provide qualitative information on nom retention with temperature higher feem intensities indicate more nom in the water thus lower permeate quality the fluorescence peaks for humic like substances are reported from 250 to 390 nm range of excitation and between 400 500 nm range of emission the fluorescence peaks for protein polysaccharides like substances are from 230 to 290 nm range of excitation and between 300 360 nm range of emission 30 in fig 4 the fluorescence intensities peaks of the nom mixture permeate water at 5 c were 18 2 au for humic acid and 21 7 au for proteins alginate at 20 c the feem intensities for humic acid in the permeate water increased to 25 6 au whereas much higher protein alginate substances were found in the permeate water 38 6 au indicating lower nom retention at 20 c compared to 5 c van den brink et al 12 study with mbr systems found that with decreasing temperature a shift was found in polysaccharides particle size distribution which led to high retention and fast pore blocking thus higher fouling at lower temperature the feem results correlate well with the umfif values fig 3 and nom retention data table 1 demonstrating the effect of temperature on nom retention by the ceramic uf membrane and the quality of permeate water 3 2 impact of feed water temperature on backwash and chemical cleaning effectiveness the overall umfi analysis showed an impact of water temperature on nom fouling this can be further categorized by the reversible and irreversible fouling fractions to help assess backwash and chemical cleaning effectiveness fig 5 demonstrates that with decreasing temperature from 20 c to 5 c the hydraulically irreversible fouling index umfihir increased by 35 p 0 05 whereas the umfihir decreased by 15 p 0 05 with increasing temperature from 20 c to 35 c thus the increase in nom fouling at lower temperature was due to the higher irreversible accumulation of nom which resisted hydraulic backwashes that is the temperature drop not only increases fouling due to hydraulic resistance with the increased water viscosity but also the very nature of the nom alters with the drop in water temperature and some fraction of the nom shifts from reversible at 20 c to irreversible at 5 c this is reflected in the hydraulically reversible fouling index umfihr data in which the backwash efficiency was lower at 5 c and increased as temperature increased from 5 c to 20 c the chemically irreversible fouling index umficir was the highest at 5 c indicating lower chemical cleaning efficiency at the lower temperature irreversibility of the foulant layer is a major concern during membrane filtration as it influences physical and chemical cleaning requirements the significant amount of hydraulically and chemically irreversible fouling at 5 c pose a potential limitation to longer membrane operation fig 6 shows the hydraulically reversible to irreversible fouling ratios umfihr umfihir and carbon ratios chr chir at different temperature with decreasing water temperature from 20 c to 5 c the umfihr umfihir ratio of the nom mixture decreased from 0 62 to 0 35 p 0 05 the decreased in the umfihr umfihir at lower temperature indicated lower hydraulic backwash efficiency thus higher nom hydraulically irreversible fouling this can be supported by the carbon data in which the chr chir ratio decreased from 0 45 to 0 31 with decreasing temperature from 20 c to 5 c thus the backwash pressure applied to mitigate fouling at standard feed water temperature of 20 c was not sufficient in removing nom fouling deposits at 5 c this is consistent with the increase in specific cake resistance and nom retention values at lower temperature refer to table 1 the umfihr umfihir and chr chir ratios at 35 c increased to 0 71 and 0 66 respectively indicating more effective backwash at higher temperature this could be partially attributed to the lower cake resistance and nom retention at 35 c refer to table 1 hence better cleaning the results from the umfi analysis can be supported by the feem plots of the nom mixture backwash water fig 7 at 20 c the fluorescence intensities peaks for humic acid and proteins alginate were 27 6 au and 37 1 au respectively while at 5 c the fluorescence intensities peaks for humic acid in the backwash water was 24 2 au and surprisingly no proteins alginate were found in the backwash water at 5 c by comparing the feem plots of the permeate water fig 4 and the backwash water fig 7 at 5 c it is clear that proteins alginate substances resisted hydraulic backwash and caused irreversible fouling for the ceramic uf ma et al 11 and van den brink et al 12 studies found that lower temperature had negative impacts on proteins and polysaccharides substances and biofouling in mbr systems therefore both proteins and polysaccharides are problematic for membrane systems and more impacted by water temperature condition than humic substances the feem plots correlate well with the umfihr umfihir ratios fig 6 demonstrating the effect of temperature on the nom reversibility and irreversibility therefore it is recommended to alter membrane backwash procedure with temperature i e by increasing backwash pressure frequency etc to control membrane fouling fig 8 shows the chemical cleaning cip efficiency at different feed water temperature conditions the umficr umfihir and ccr chir ratios under the operation at 5 c was 0 78 and 0 58 respectively while the ratios at 20 c were significantly higher 0 92 and 0 81 respectively p 0 05 thus chemical cleaning was not effective in removing irreversible fouling at 5 c whereas at 20 c the foulants were effectively removed the decrease in the cleaning efficiency at 5 c is attributed to the high irreversible fouling refer to fig 5 at 35 c cleaning of the ceramic membrane was easier than 5 c and 20 c conditions resulting in higher umficr umfihir and ccr chir ratios of 0 96 and 0 87 respectively feem plots of the naocl chemical wash water fig 9 were used to qualitatively assess the cleaning efficiency at different temperature at 5 c condition higher intensities of humic acid 32 6 au but much lower intensities for bsa alginate 18 4 au feem intensities at 20 c for humic acid was 29 8 au which was approximately similar to that at 5 c while much higher feem intensities for bsa alginate 38 1 au these results indicate that the lower cleaning efficiency at 5 c is attributed to the higher irreversible mass of bsa alginate in the nom mixture solution therefore alteration of membrane chemical cleaning procedure at lower temperature is recommended to control chemically irreversible fouling and achieve higher permeability recovery chemical cleaning procedure was effective at both 20 c and 35 c p 0 05 refer to fig 8 indicating that chemical cleaning procedure used at standard temperature 20 c should be sufficient at 35 c when needed 3 3 suitability of the mfi uf index for fouling prediction with ceramic membranes the mfi uf and umfi methods are used to evaluate membrane fouling however the different approaches in fouling assessment may suggest that direct comparison lack context the mfi uf provides an index value that indicates the fouling tendency of membrane feed whereas the umfi provides information on the current fouling a membrane is subjected to i e reversible vs irreversible however the actual capacity of the mfi uf to be used effectively as a prediction tool with nom fouling for ceramic membranes has yet to be evaluated in general and under changing water temperature conditions fig 10 shows the fouling index values fig 10a specific cake resistances fig 10b and nom retention fig 10c at different water temperature conditions as predicted by the mfi uf testing the mfi uf values and specific cake resistances were calculated following the procedure described in section 2 3 4 the results in fig 10a show that the mfi uf value of the nom mixture decreased significantly p 0 05 as the water temperature increased from 5 c to 35 c indicating lower fouling potential at higher temperature nom in cold water temperatures i e 5 c appears to have higher fouling potential mfi uf of 10 122 s l2 compared to that at warmer temperatures mfi uf of 6850 s l2 and 3774 s l2 for 20 c and 35 c respectively this could be a critical issue in assessing nom fouling specifically in regions where there is a large seasonal variation in water temperature as in north america and some parts of europe the decrease in water temperature caused changes to the cake layer that was formed and the amount of nom retained by the ceramic uf as shown in fig 10b and c the specific cake resistance αc was found to increase with decreasing temperature from 20 c to 5 c fig 10b along with an increase in nom retention fig 10c therefore the increase in the mfi uf value at the lower temperature was related to the impact of temperature on bsa and alginate size as shown in the feem images resulting in high nom retention by the uf membrane and an increase in specific cake resistance whereas at high temperature nom were passing through the uf membrane to the filtrate side thus lower fouling and mfi uf value variation in water temperature demonstrated an impact on both the fouling potential of nom mfi uf and fouling mechanism umfi fig 11 a shows that the mfi uf fouling prediction trend is in agreement with the fouling tendency observed using the umfi method moreover fig 11b and c show good correlations between specific cake resistance and nom retention values obtained in the mfi uf and ceramic uf systems thus the mfi uf testing method demonstrates a useful fit for predicting nom fouling and retention for ceramic membranes before relying on operating data i e umfi although there are differences in the numerical values of specific cake resistances and nom retentions which are attributed to the differences in membrane materials and characteristics the mfi uf is simple and short filtration test that can be used as a rapid assessment of nom fouling compared to the umfi analysis which normally requires long term filtration data thus a ceramic membrane plant could use the mfi uf in addition to the umfi to assess potential changes in nom fouling with temperature and make required alternations in membrane pretreatment and or cleaning procedures 4 conclusions this research investigated the impact of water temperature on nom fouling and cleaning of a tubular ceramic uf membrane using the umfi and mfi uf fouling index methods key findings were the effect of variation of feed water temperature on fouling of ceramic uf membranes was over and beyond simple viscosity changes of water the umfif and nom retention increased when the water temperature decreased from 35 c to 5 c due to changes in nom fouling behavior and specific fouling resistance thus fouling analysis performed at standard temperature 20 c will underestimate the impact of cold water condition on ceramic membranes performance the reversible and irreversible fouling ratio umfihr umfihir changed with temperature thus alteration of backwash procedure i e increase or decrease in backwash pressure with temperature is required to help control fouling and maintain membrane productivity feem analysis demonstrated higher levels of protein removal with backwashing at 20 c temperature versus 5 c and thus feem is useful in determining specific fouling components that can be addressed under site specific nom and temperature changes changes in nom fouling characteristics with temperature as predicted by the mfi uf method demonstrated useful fit with the umfi values and nom retention data obtained in the ceramic uf system thus the utilization of the mfi uf proved to be useful for assessing the potential changes in nom fouling behavior with temperature for ceramic membrane systems acknowledgements the

schemes supported by artificial intelligence or fuzzy logic i e artificial neural networks ann statsoft 2019 many authors have investigated the use of ann for predicting processes related to wastewater treatment such as the amount of sewage inflowing to the treatment plant 19 20 quality of sewage treated in the outflow to the receiver 21 26 the activated sludge settleability 27 28 ann have gained popularity due to the ease of creating models using available software 29 the principle of constructing models using ann is based on the process of their learning with using data provided in the form of examples i e the so called learning patterns they form a set called the training set which is the main source of knowledge for the ann statsoft 2019 in general it can be assumed that the more data will be used in the learning process the forecast models will be more accurate however the correct proportions between the number of variables at the input independent variables and the number of variables at the output dependent variables must be maintained moderation is equally important in striving to obtain the maximum accuracy of models so as not to overfill the network especially with overly large anns statsoft 2019 the most popular type of artificial neural network is based on the classic perceptron model it consists of an input layer containing a number of neurons with a threshold activation function and one neuron in the output layer 30 multi layer perceptron mlp is the most commonly used structure of a non linear neural network in addition to the input and output layers it has at least one hidden layer the input signals are first multiplied by the weight values and then sequentially transmitted to the neurons of the hidden layer in individual neurons of this layer their suming takes place and the sums obtained are transformed with a linear or non linear activation function and transmitted to the output neurons the optimal selection of weight values at individual neurons takes place by way of learning and is subjected to the testing and validation process 31 this paper analyzes the possibility of using mechanically shredded waste i e flakes of

the semi technical size column model was constructed the model consisted of five identical pvc columns 100 mm in diameter and 1000 mm high fig 1 experimental columns were filled with four types of waste material of 90 cm thickness each the reference column was filled with sand only of 60 cm thickness due to its larger specific surface area following an initial period of adjustment the model columns purified sewage leaving the septic tank the sewage entered the five columns at hourly intervals i e 24 times a day each column experienced identical hydraulic load variables in the range 31 8

filtrates was collected as effluents from individual columns the sewage samples underwent physical and chemical analysis for nine parameters and indicators of pollution wastewater quality indicators wqi ph oxygen saturation content of organic compounds in the form of bod and cod total suspended solids organic suspension ammonium nitrogen nitrites and orthophosphates physical and chemical tests were performed for a mean of 9 measurement series 2 3 statistical methods statistical analysis of the filtrate quality from individual columns included three stages the first stage provided basic descriptive statistics such as mean minimum and maximum values standard deviation and coefficient of variation as the investigated parameters and indicators were expressed in variable units the data variables for 180 samples of treated sewage cases were standardized prior to the pca analysis the second stage of the statistical analysis consisted in determination of relationships in the multifactorial set of about 1600 source outcomes describing parameters and indicators of pollutant using the principal component analysis the aim of pca is to reduce the number of primary variables correlated with each other by replacing them with components that significantly explain variability statsoft 2019 a measure of variability of the input data presented in the form of principal components are eigenvalues of a correlation matrix the number of main components included in further analysis was selected based on the kaiser criterion for which the eigenvalue is greater than 1 an interpretation of factorial coordinate values for the principal components as factor variable correlation and based on correlation variable contributions was made the correlation between factor variables was graphically represented using a two dimensional graph of their coordinates the third stage included the decision about using or not using of different fillings i e four types of waste and sand used as a reference filling prediction of the decision was based on indicator cases whose values have exceeded the limit values in accordance with the polish standards for household sewage treatment plants 32 it meant that they exceed the permissible values for cod 150 mg o2 dm 3 bod5 40 mg o2 dm 3 or for suspended solids 40 mg dm 3 the function of automatic designer was used in the calculations of selection of artificial neural network structure for the forecasting of the type of filling in vertical filters a multi layer perceptron mlp method was used consisting of three layers input hidden and output in order to find the most effective ann structure the number of neurons in the input layer consisted of variables related to the type of filling values of the hydraulic load reduction of organic compounds bod cod reduction of total suspended solids the analyzes assume that in the developed models the number of neurons in the hidden layer will change in the range of 1 2 k 1 where k is the number of entries in the layer of hidden neurons and in the initial layer several activation functions were considered linear logistic hyperbolic tangent sinusoidal and exponential functions 29 the analyzes assume that the training set will constitute 70 of the data 15 in the case of the test set and 15 in the validation set the process of artificial neural networks learning was carried out using the back error propagation broyden flecher goldfarb shanno method bfgs 30 twenty different artificial neural networks were generated and the parameters for matching the results of calculations to the measurement data were determined for them the original ann selection was made based on the interpretation of the standard error functions for this purpose the sum of the squared differences between the set values and the values obtained at the outputs of each output neuron sos and the correlation coefficients determining the quality of the learning and testing process was calculated the statistics of goodness of fit of the statistics in classification issues qualitative variables were used for the final assessment of the predictive capacity of models a chi squared χ2 and a g squared statistic a roc receiver operating characteristic curve was used as a tool to assess and compare the classification models among themselves the number of true and false positives is counted the number of true and false negative cases and on the basis of these values the sensitivity and specificity of the classification method based on the examined parameter is determined based on the calculation of the area under curve auc and treating it as a measure of goodness and accuracy of a given model a better matched model can be selected based on a larger auc value 33 the statistical analysis was carried out using statistica 12 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 physical and chemical analysis pretreated sewage came from the septic tank table 1 presents basic descriptive statistics of the pretreated sewage entering the experimental model the sewage reaching the experimental model from the storage tank showed high variability of oxygen saturation wn 2 32 its mean value

followed a similar trend as for bod wn about 0 60 and ranged from 73 0 mgo2 dm 3 to 773 3 mgo2 dm 3 mean cod bod ratio in the sewage fed onto individual columns was 1 8 and this implies the presence of easily and hardly degradable organic pollutants similar results for organic compounds in sewage pretreated in a septic tank were obtained by wąsik and chmielowski 18 the sewage collected from the septic tank had moderate coefficient of variation wn 0 6 concentration range for suspended solids fluctuated from 32 3 mg dm 3 to 243 7 mg dm 3 with the mean value of 87 0 mg dm 3 the values of the above indicators reported by other authors 18 34 suggest higher concentrations of organic compounds and total suspended solids in the sewage leaving the septic tank the sewage entering the experimental model from the storage tank showed a low coefficient of variation of biogenic substances i e ammonium nitrogen wn 0 15 and orthophosphates wn 0 20 the content of n nh4 ranged from 114 6 mg dm 3 to 210 3 mg dm 3 with a mean of 159 0 mg dm 3 the values determined for po4 3 fell between 26 2 mg dm 3 and 62 8 mgo2 dm 3 with a mean of 43 0 mgo2 dm 3 these numbers were similar to those reported by other authors 26 35 3 2 statistical analysis since it was rather hard to see any significant relationship between the source data 180 cases 9 variables the pca method was employed by

of the information contained in the input variables explained by three principal components selected for further analysis the sum of squared coefficients of principal components so called communality was used table 6 the first three principal components carried together about 90 of the information on suspended solids and organic suspension variables for n nh4 oxygen saturation and ph variables these values were about 60 fig 2 shows the relationships between nine input variables and principal components 1 and 2 for all column fillings position of suspended solids organic suspension indicated their high correlation position of n nh4 n no2 ph describing the removal of ammonium nitrogen in the nitrification process demonstrated their moderate correlation also position of cod bod indicated their moderate correlation these variables and oxygen saturation located on the opposite sides of the graph were highly negatively correlated the pca analysis made it possible to simplify the interpretation of the obtained results while retaining maximum information about the process in order to choose the most appropriate wastes used as filling material in vertical flow filters an ann analysis was used the architecture of selected mlp networks and the results of obtained neural model predictions for input data are presented in tables 7 and 8 the ssn calculations showed that for the 20 neural network structures generated the best results for the prediction of decisions about the type of filling material used were obtained in the case of two networks the selected networks had 7 or 9 neurons in the hidden layer 2 neurons in the initial layer and the logistic activation function in the hidden layer and the exponential or linear function in the initial layer both mlp 11 7 2 and

to measurements in the form of sos squares error and correlation coefficient determined for learning testing and validation processes for the testing and validation process the values of correlation coefficients for networks mlp 11 7 2 with fewer hidden neurons were higher than for mlp 11 9 2 networks a similar level of values of correlation coefficients at a high level of 88 5 indicates a good adjustment of the structure of both networks based on training data the values of goodness of fit are presented in table 9 mlp 11 7 2 network was characterized by higher chi squared and g squared

11 7 2 was characterized by a smaller inconsistency percentage of true negative and positive decision about using the filling than the ann type mlp 11 9 2 a properly prepared input data set was used to train a neural network in the form of a multi layer perceptron in tables 13 and 14 an analysis of the functioning of a trained neural network comparing its responses with the reduction values

summary and conclusions wastewater quality indicators such as biochemical oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand and suspended solids indicate the main pollutants in domestic sewage according to polish standards 32 it is also very important to evaluate the concentration of biogenic compounds the main challenge consists in choosing an appropriate system for home sewage treatment plants the sand filling used in the most commonly technology vff combined with a septic tank can be replaced with alternative materials when using new vff filling materials the decision support systems could be useful decision support systems i e ann analysis preceded by principal component analysis proved helpful in evaluating the quality of sewage treated in a system comprising a septic tank and a vertical flow filter filled with mechanically shredded waste the pca method allowed for assessing multidimensional relationships between the parameters and indicators describing the quality of filtrates outflowing from each columns the proposed method of using artificial neural networks seems to be an effective tool supporting the decision about the choice of the waste material filling vertical filters cooperating with the septic tank an analysis of the functioning of the trained neural network was performed comparing its responses with the reduction values obtained for individual fillings under changing hydraulic conditions generally a good agreement between the predictions of the neural model and the reduction values was obtained but a subset of conflicting solutions in amount 13 was also detected most of these cases concerned the situation when the ssn qualified the filling as not eligible for use more false answers about not using the fillings were observed in the mlp 11 9 2 network which was in line with the inconsistency percentage in the process of domestic sewage treatment the mechanically shredded waste in the form of pet flakes trims of polyurethane foam shredded rubber tires and polyester wadding turned out to be an interesting alternative for filter fillings used so far these types of tested waste may serve as effective filling of vertical flow filters without additional aeration they reduce the costs of sewage treatment plants and may help recycle solid waste as the results for the investigated types of recyclable materials were so promising further studies to test their connection with sand are suggested

decision support system ann waste pet polyurethane foam rubber tires treatment process 1 introduction member states of the european union implement different systems of waste management recycling is highly popular in scandinavia 1 2 belgium england germany or austria 3 5 the countries utilizing advanced waste management systems contrary to that landfilling still predominates in the countries with developing economy e g romania or bulgaria landfilled wastes such as tires pur foam and pet bottles have a long life are non biodegradable and consume valuable landfill capacity one of the aims of a program published by the european commission on december 2015 with changes on may 2018 assumes landfilling reduction to a maximum of 10 of all waste until 2030 com 2015 0596 2015 pe 12 2018 rev 2 2018 the european commission adopted on january 2018 the strategy for plastics in a circular economy which aims to transform the way plastic products are designed produced used and recycled in the eu com 2018 028 2018 the waste may be recycled using one of recycling technologies e g mechanical material chemical resource or energy incineration recycling 6 9 the most popular mechanical recycling consists in the fragmentation of used waste into a granulate or recyclate that may be reprocessed pet bottles are a typical example a regranulate of pet bottles may be used in the manufacture of fibers fleece fabrics food packaging or automotive foams 10 fractions of chipped or shredded rubber waste e g tires may be added into new rubber mixtures as lightweight embankment fill drainage layers thermal isolation scrap tire management 2011 or used in new rubber production 11 thermal stability of most of the polyurethane materials means they are preferably recycled in chemical processes such as glycolysis 6 12 used in biodiesel production 12 13 shredded compacted or molded polyurethane waste may be transformed into a recyclate used e g for insulating heating installations ekotech 2016 or as an element of thermal insulation 14 however these recycling processes are mostly not cost effective 15 an interesting solution is employing the waste as a support material in wastewater treatment zidan et al 16 used shredded tires and corrugated pieces of plastic pipes in wastewater treatment through horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands they managed to remove 39 61 of total suspended solids tss 20 49 of bod and 19 49 of cod after 200 days of the wetland operation plastic media showed the highest removal efficiency of bod cod and tss with gravel on the second and rubber on the third place garcía pérez et al 17 used recycled shredded tire chips in a constructed wetland to treat high strength wastewater from a bakery after three year operation the efficiency removal

treatment of domestic sewage on a vertical flow filter vff filled with pet flakes the filters were effective in ammonium nitrogen removal mean 66 7 and reducing the count of escherichia coli mean 98 1 and coliform bacteria mean 98 4 an important step in using new materials in waste treatment is a decision making process that may be supported by decision support systems dss dsss collect and visualize data and through the use of learning mechanisms and analogies may suggest the best solution dsss include highly advanced it systems that provide interactive access to data and decision schemes supported by artificial intelligence or fuzzy logic i e artificial neural networks ann statsoft 2019 many authors have investigated the use of ann for predicting processes related to wastewater treatment such as the amount of sewage inflowing to the treatment plant 19 20 quality of sewage treated in the outflow to the receiver 21 26 the activated sludge settleability 27 28 ann have gained popularity due to the ease of creating models using available software 29 the principle of constructing models using ann is based on the process of their learning with using data provided in the form of examples i e the so called learning patterns they form a set called the training set which is the main source of knowledge for the ann statsoft 2019 in general it can be assumed that the more data will be used in the learning process the forecast models will be more accurate however the correct proportions between the number of variables at the input independent variables and the number of variables at the output dependent variables must be maintained moderation is equally important in striving to obtain the maximum accuracy of models so as not to overfill the network especially with overly large anns statsoft 2019 the most popular type of artificial neural network is based on the classic perceptron model it consists of an input layer containing a number of neurons with a threshold activation function and one neuron in the output layer 30 multi layer perceptron mlp is the most commonly used structure of a non linear neural network in addition to the input and output layers it has at least one hidden layer the input signals are first multiplied by the weight values and then sequentially transmitted to the neurons of the hidden layer in individual neurons of this layer their suming takes place and the sums obtained are transformed with a linear or non linear activation function and transmitted to the output neurons the optimal selection of weight values at individual neurons takes place by way of learning and is subjected to the testing and validation process 31 this paper analyzes the possibility of using mechanically shredded waste i e flakes of polyethylene terephthalate elastic polyurethane foams shredded rubber tires and wadding polyester for purification of domestic sewage on vertical flow filters the efficiency of a technology of preliminary settling tank vertical flow filter in removing pollutants such as organic compounds biogenic compounds and suspended solids was assessed using decision support systems i e artificial neural networks ann analysis preceded by principal component analysis pca 2 research methodology 2 1 research object to evaluate performance of the vertical flow filters combined with a septic tank the semi technical size column model was constructed the model consisted of five identical pvc columns 100 mm in diameter and 1000 mm high fig 1 experimental columns were filled with four types of waste material of 90 cm thickness each the reference column was filled with sand only of 60 cm thickness due to its larger specific surface area following an initial period of adjustment the model columns purified sewage leaving the septic tank the sewage entered the five columns at hourly intervals i e 24 times a day each column experienced identical hydraulic load variables in the range 31 8 mm d 1 76 4 mm d 1 114 6 mm d 1and 229 2 mm d 1 2 2 physical and chemical analysis the pretreated sewage was collected from a separating chamber downstream of the septic tank and the treated sewage filtrates was collected as effluents from individual columns the sewage samples underwent physical and chemical analysis for nine parameters and indicators of pollution wastewater quality indicators wqi ph oxygen saturation content of organic compounds in the form of bod and cod total suspended solids organic suspension ammonium nitrogen nitrites and orthophosphates physical and chemical tests were performed for a mean of 9 measurement series 2 3 statistical methods statistical analysis of the filtrate quality from individual columns included three stages the first stage provided basic descriptive statistics such as mean minimum and maximum values standard deviation and coefficient of variation as the investigated parameters and indicators were expressed in variable units the data variables for 180 samples of treated sewage cases were standardized prior to the pca analysis the second stage of the statistical analysis consisted in determination of relationships in the multifactorial set of about 1600 source outcomes describing parameters and indicators of pollutant using the principal component analysis the aim of pca is to reduce the number of primary variables correlated with each other by replacing them with components that significantly explain variability statsoft 2019 a measure of variability of the input data presented in the form of principal components are eigenvalues of a correlation matrix the number of main components included in further analysis was selected based on the kaiser criterion for which the eigenvalue is greater than 1 an interpretation of factorial coordinate values for the principal components as factor variable correlation and based on correlation variable contributions was made the correlation between factor variables was graphically represented using a two dimensional graph of their coordinates the third stage included the decision about using or not using of different fillings i e four types of waste and sand used as a reference filling prediction of the decision was based on indicator cases whose values have exceeded the limit values in accordance with the polish standards for household sewage treatment plants 32 it meant that they exceed the permissible values for cod 150 mg o2 dm 3 bod5 40 mg o2 dm 3 or for suspended solids 40 mg dm 3 the function of automatic designer was used in the calculations of selection of artificial neural network structure for the forecasting of the type of filling in vertical filters a multi layer perceptron mlp method was used consisting of three layers input hidden and output in order to find the most effective ann structure the number of neurons in the input layer consisted of variables related to the type of filling values of the hydraulic load reduction of organic compounds bod cod reduction of total suspended solids the analyzes assume that in the developed models the number of neurons in the hidden layer will change in the range of 1 2 k 1 where k is the number of entries in the layer of hidden neurons and in the initial layer several activation functions were considered linear logistic hyperbolic tangent sinusoidal and exponential functions 29 the analyzes assume that the training set will constitute 70 of the data 15 in the case of the test set and 15 in the validation set the process of artificial neural networks learning was carried out using the back error propagation broyden flecher goldfarb shanno method bfgs 30 twenty different artificial neural networks were generated and the parameters for matching the results of calculations to the measurement data were determined for them the original ann selection was made based on the interpretation of the standard error functions for this purpose the sum of the squared differences between the set values and the values obtained at the outputs of each output neuron sos and the correlation coefficients determining the quality of the learning and testing process was calculated the statistics of goodness of fit of the statistics in classification issues qualitative variables were used for the final assessment of the predictive capacity of models a chi squared χ2 and a g squared statistic a roc receiver operating characteristic curve was used as a tool to assess and compare the classification models among themselves the number of true and false positives is counted the number of true and false negative cases and on the basis of these values the sensitivity and specificity of the classification method based on the examined parameter is determined based on the calculation of the area under curve auc and treating it as a measure of goodness and accuracy of a given model a better matched model can be selected based on a larger auc value 33 the statistical

14368,in this research three techniques to control the permeability and the antifouling property of microporous pes membranes fabricated by the phase inversion and posterior drying have been reported the three explored methods included incorporating the cuo zno nanomaterial in the pes matrix altering the solvents filling the pores before drying water ethanol isopropanol and 50 acetone water and changing the drying temperature from room temperature to 70 c based on the obtained results it was found that varying the drying solvents and increasing the drying temperature had a tangible effect on the permeability and antifouling property of the bare and blended polyethersulfone pes membranes this in turn resulted in improving the pure water flux from 39 3 to 406 kg m2h moreover addition of the cuo zno nanomaterial in the optimum content 0 2 wt to the pes matrix in wet membranes led to the growth of 47 2 in the permeability and the increase of the flux recovery ration frr to the highest value however this addition did not lead to the proposed effect in the case of the dried membranes keywords drying method polyethersulfone permeability improvement antifouling property cuo zno nanocomposite 1 introduction membrane separation process has been one of the widely used technologies in most industries and applications in the recent years some advantages such as high selectivity low energy cost operational simplicity and flexibility easy control scale up and the reduced use of chemicals have made this technology beneficial in numerous applications and operations 1 in the commercial scale ultrafiltration membranes for the referred applications are made from polyethersulfone pes polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and polysulfone psf 1 4 some of its prominent properties such as high thermal mechanical and chemical stability good resistance under heat aging and hydraulic stability have made pes an appropriate choice 5 having high permeability and flux to perform the separation test with the acceptable results is one of the main challenges encountered in preparing ultrafiltration membranes nonetheless membrane fouling phenomenon is a major disadvantage arising from the hydrophobic nature of the pes membranes including uf mf nf and reverse osmosis ro specific interactions between the components in the feed stream and the membrane can lead to membrane fouling resulting in a decline trend of permeability the collapse of the membrane structure and an increase in the cost of the membrane replacement 6 so applying a technique to reduce the fouling phenomenon is inevitable for the membranes fabrication various methods such as mixing with hydrophilic additives 2 7 11 blending with hydrophilic and amphiphilic polymers 12 employing cold plasma treatment 8 13 applying surface coating 14 15 use of nanomaterials 16 and using chemical grafting 17 have been considered to modify the membranes and reduce the fouling phenomenon incorporation of nanomaterials into the polymeric matrix of the membranes is the most widely used solution to improve the separation efficiency and fouling resistance 16 various inorganic nanomaterials such as copper cu 17 zinc zn 18 al2o3 19 zinc oxide zno 10 silver ag 20 tio2 21 c3n4 22 potassium perchlorate kclo4 2 ferrosoferric oxide fe3o4 9 zirconium dioxide zro2 19 23 carbon nanotubes cnt 24 and graphene 25 have been applied as additives to modify the pes membranes numerous advantages of some mineral nanoparticles like zno such as photocatalytic activity low cost and valuable antibacterial characteristics have made them appropriate additives 10 26 further adding the zno nanomaterials to the polymeric matrix of the membrane can remarkably increase the hydrophilicity of the nanocomposite membranes so modifying hydrophilicity can be the main reason to use appropriate materials in order to change this parameter of the polymeric membranes 26 the main sequence of zno blending in the membrane matrix is the positive modification of the physical and chemical properties of the nanocomposite membranes 27 previous researches on the zno nanoparticles can serve as a good guide for developing new usages in the membrane matrix to enhance the permeability and antifouling properties moreover copper oxide cuo can be one of the appropriate and hydrophilic choices among the wide range of nanoparticles not seriously considered as a factor to improve the membrane properties a combination of hydrophilic cuo and caco3 nanoparticles with 1 2 wt in the pvdf matrix was applied 31 this led to two main consequences notable enlargement of surface pores and the modification of the finger like layer to the thicker one to fabricate the polymeric membrane films the phase inversion procedure was used eventually a significant improvement in the properties of the new mixed matrix membrane was observed nuri akar et al 17 also used nanosized cu and se particles as additives to fabricate new ultrafiltration pes membranes the optimized blended membranes with the expected properties were obtained the 0 05 wt cu pes membranes rejected protein as much as 86 3 whereas better resistance to the loss of the pure water flux belonged to the se pes membrane based on our previous researches 28 30 adding various forms of these nanomaterials such as cuo cuo zno nanocomposite and amine functionalized cuo and zno nanoparticles could result in the appreciable growth of permeability and improvement in the antifouling and rejection properties of the blended pes membranes the presence of numerous oh groups on the zno nanoparticles surface has made them an influential option for use with such additives as cuo nanoparticles in the polymeric membrane matrix in addition regarding the distribution property of such nanocomposites it should be noted that the better distribution of them in the polymeric matrix could be an advantage as compared with the sole cuo and zno another benefit of the nanocomposite incorporation in the casting solution is decreasing the agglomeration occurring in the membrane matrix the effects of the addition of cuo and zno nanoparticles to the polymeric matrix of membrane in the individual and composite form have been investigated comprehensively in our previous studies 28 30 it has been concluded that the embedded membrane with the 0 2 wt cuo zno has the best growth in terms of permeability and antifouling resistance the phase inversion method is the most common method used for fabricating polymeric membranes four mains steps in this method include polymer dissolution in a suitable solvent casting solution conditions of film casting type and conditions of phase inversion and membrane post treatment 31 in order to modify the membrane performance some simple changes in the membrane preparation such as varying the composition of the polymeric solutions and conditions during the phase inversion coagulation bath and making a post treatment stage conditioning drying or crosslinking could be applied the morphology of the prepared membranes could be modified by choosing a non solvent a coagulation bath the point that should be considered is the exchange rate between the non solvent and the solvent during the phase inversion method the higher rate of this exchange results in the higher porosity of the fabricated membranes 32 vankelecom et al 33 used water n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp as a non solvent solvent pair to fabricate the polysulfone membranes it was found that the use of additives such as alcohol or dmf could change the rate of exchange between the non solvent solvent temperature is another factor which can influence the coagulation bath generally the higher coagulation bath temperature causes the higher rate of the solvent non solvent exchange creating a more porous structure 33 several post casting treatments such as temperature variation evaporation period air velocity when a convective flow is used and the relative humidity of the air can be effective on the membrane performance there are several post treatment methods which can help to stabilize and improve the membrane performance such as employing plasma treatment drying with the solvent replacement method immersing in concentrated mineral acids keeping the membrane in water or drying membranes 34 37 storing under wet conditions is common for the membranes fabricated by the wet phase inversion method this is because when the drying method is performed to prepare the membranes the structure of the membrane is changed collapses the collapse phenomenon is more obvious for uf and nf membranes the collapse of the nodular structure is the main result of the irreversible loss of the solvent permeance during drying 34 as a matter of fact to lessen the possibility of nodule collapse upon drying multiple solvent exchanging procedures can be absolutely effective in this procedure first the solvent is used to replace the residual non solvent maintained in the membrane after immersing in the coagulation bath in the next step the used non solvent is substituted by another volatile solvent with a lower boiling point which could be easily eliminated during evaporation to prepare the dried membrane 38 40 brown 41 introduced a theory to describe the nodular collapse during the film formation of polymer latex particles regarding pi ultrafiltration beerlage 34 also applied this theory and described a logical relation between the capillary forces fc and the deformation resistance of the matrix fr as brought up by brown to calculate fc eq 1 was applied where γ n m 2 is the surface tension of the gas liquid interface inside the pores a m2 is the cross sectional area of the pores θ deg is the measured contact angle between the membrane surface and the liquid and rp m is the pores radius furthermore fr can be calculated by eq 2 where e n m 2 is the tensile modulus of the polymer material that can be assumed as a measure of the pores wall elasticity based on this method the collapse of the nodular structure will happen if fc fr eq 3 1 f c 2 γ r p cos θ a 2 f r 0 37 e a so for any prepared membrane the pores will fall in if 3 2 γ cos θ r p 0 37 e it seems that if the strength of the membrane matrix is high enough due to minimizing the surface tension for example by changing the last solvent before evaporation it will be possible to keep the pore structure of the membrane i e to reduce the capillary force 34 38 39 41 42 in our previous work we presented cuo zno czn as a novel additive to the pes dope solution that study was a comprehensive investigation of the new blended membranes showing its excellent stability in the pure water flux and its antifouling property according to our findings the optimum amount of czn addition to the pes solution was about 0 2 wt 30 meanwhile other factors such as membrane post treatment procedures and the specific temperature of the drying method can make a significant difference in the membrane performance it should be noted that the drying step is vital to maintain the performance of the membrane in the wet condition 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials zncl2 cuso4 5h2o and naoh and the applied drying solvents such as ethanol isopropanol and acetone were all purchased from the merck company germany to provide the other essential materials such as dimethylacetamide dmac polyethylene glycol peg mw 4000 g mole and bovine serum albumin bsa mw 67 000 g mole sigma aldrich company was chosen also polyethersulfone pes ultrason e6020 p with mw 58 000 g mole was gained from basf co germany 2 2 fabrication of the cuo zno nanocomposite the procedure for the cuo zno nanocomposite synthesis has been extensively presented in our previous work 30 to put it briefly for the preparation of the aqueous medium a glass plate reaction plate was filled by 30 ml of distilled water and naoh granuls were added to water to obtain the 10 0 mol l naoh solution then zncl2 2 0 mmol and cuso4 5h2o 1 0 mmol were mixed with the naoh solution as the next step a sealed glass bottle was selected to maintain the obtained solution in an oven at 80 c for 24 h subsequently to gain the natural sediment it had to be cooled down finally to get the pure solid the possible residual had to eliminate the block one to do this purification distilled water and alcohol were used to wash the sediment the gained sediment had to be kept at 80 c for 12 h to ensure the dryness of it 2 3 fabrication of the bare and blended membranes the steps and method followed for the preparation of the nanocomposite membranes by the non solvent induced phase separation nips have been reported in our previous work 30 the compositions of the membranes included 18 wt pes polymer 2 wt peg 4000 relative to the total membrane dmac as the solvent for the bare membrane and the 0 2 wt cuo zno nanocomposite for the blended membrane 30 for further dispersion of the nanoparticles after degassing the dissolved polymeric solution a sonicated bath was used for the nanocomposites dispersion to cast the casting solutions on the nonwoven sheets an applicator with 150 μm thickness was applied the water coagulation bath 25 c was used to solidify the formed film in it instantly the prepared membranes were kept in distilled water for 12 h before testing three solvents were used as the exchange solvents ethanol isopropanol and 50 acetone 50 water for the drying method one of the key points was the immersion time in the second solvent this time was selected to be 30 min for the fabricated membranes to ensure water evacuation from the formed pores finally the membranes were left to be dried at the ambient temperature or 70 c in an oven all steps in the membrane preparation were followed at room temperature with the relative humidity rh of about 30 40 2 4 membrane characterization 2 4 1 scanning electron microscopy sem in order to recognize the membranes morphology tescan sem czech republic was applied to take the sem images the membrane samples had to be prepared liquid nitrogen was used to rigidify the samples for a few seconds by immersing the prepared membranes in it and breaking them for the cross sectional images to provide enough conductivity for samples all of the prepared membranes were covered with gold and the images were recorded at 20 kv 2 4 2 quality of the nanoparticles distribution within the membrane layers in order to further investigate the nanoparticles distribution in the membranes depth direction electron dispersion spectroscopy edx was employed the special instrument for edx analysis was an oxford inca energy 250 edx 2 4 3 contact angle measurement to specify the surface hydrophilicity of the fabricated membranes a contact angle goniometer g10 kruss germany was applied the sessile drop method was used to measure the contact angle of the prepared membranes at the constant temperature and humidity 25 c and 50 respectively to determine the contact angles in the static mode a specific volume of water was intently dropped on the top surface of the membranes to get more accurate results ten random spots of the membrane surfaces were chosen to measure the contact angle under the same condition 2 5 membrane performance to test the fabricated membranes an active membrane area of 19 6 cm2 was cut and put in the batch type dead end system before starting the performance test the dried membranes were soaked in the deionized water for 30 min to return part of the wettability of the prepared membrane the sufficient force was required to drive the liquid through the dead end cell so a nitrogen gas capsule was connected to a pressure regulator and a gauge to provide this pressure to provide the required turbulence all cells were equipped with a string system with 300 rpm rotation for the first step to ensure the suitable stability of the membrane for further permeation tests a compression process had to be done the authenticated pressure for this compaction step was 0 5 mpa the period of compression was equal for all of the performed tests and this duration was 30 min in the second step to evaluate the permeation experiments the operation pressure was 0 3 mpa at the room temperature 2 5 1 permeability criterion of the pure water flux of the membranes is the weight of the collected water every 5 min the weight of the collected permeate was recorded during 90 min automatically to get the most accuracy each of the membranes was tested at least 6 times the pure water flux jw 1 was estimated by the following equation 4 j w 1 m a t where m kg is the weight of the collected permeate a m2 is the effective area of the tested membrane and t h is the time of the permeation process 2 5 2 rejection since the dairy industry is the most important application of the uf membranes the rejection ability of the fabricated membranes is vital meanwhile protein filtration is a suitable technique to survey this parameter bsa protein is one of the popular agents and standard methods used for the rejection and antifouling tests to determine this parameter in the bsa filtration test the last drops of the permeate and adequate amounts of retentate were collected and sealed separately then to determine the concentration of bsa a uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr 2000 usa was applied to calculate the bsa rejection eq 5 was applied as a formula 5 r 1 c c 0 100 where c and c0 are the bsa concentrations in the permeate and retentate mg l respectively 2 6 antifouling tests to comprehensively investigate the antifouling capacity of the uf membrane flux recovery ratio frr was used for this test the bsa solution 500 mg l was prepared in proper amounts and replaced by pure water after jw 1 kg m2h determination to gain the foulant flux jp kg m2h at the pressure of 0 3 mpa and with the rotation speed of 300 rpm after finishing the fouling test to eliminate any probable reversible fouling on the membrane surface the cells were evacuated and the tested membranes were removed and submerged in the water bath for 20 min in the next part jw 2 kg m2h was determined under the same process conditions to filter the pure water for the second time immediately after tanking and membrane washing with distilled water finally the following equation was applied to estimate the frr of the membranes 29 6 f r r j w 2 j w 1 100 2 7 copper and zinc release inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp oes arcos eop germany was applied to investigate the release behavior of the cuo zno nanocomposite from the 0 2 wt czn pes mixed matrix membrane accordingly five samples of the chosen membrane were cut in a certain area 1 cm 1 cm and immersed in 10 ml of milli q water at room temperature independently 24 48 72 96 and 120 h after immersion the membrane was taken out and the remaining liquid was poured into a special container during five days separately 44 finally the cu content of the collected liquids was measured by icp oes 3 results and discussion ftir spectrum xrd pattern and sem micrograph were applied to characterize the cuo zno nanocomposite as presented in our previous paper 30 confirming the synthesis of these nanoparticles all results related to characterizations were compatible with the literature 43 3 1 characterization of the membranes 3 1 1 surface characteristics of the bare and czn blended pes membranes to explore the effect of czn addition with an optimum amount of 0 2 wt by changing the drying solvent and the drying temperature on the structure of the pes membranes sem images were applied the surface sem images of the prepared membranes in the resolutions of 15 kx are displayed in figs 1 4 the specific difference between these four figures was in different drying solvents used which were estimated to have the major effect on the dried membrane properties with the inorganic addition czn the change of the drying solvent from water to ethanol isopropanol and acetone 50 and the increase of the drying temperature from the ambient temperature to 70 c the smooth surface of the fabricated membranes was retained it should be noted that mass or lump could not be seen on the surface of the blended membranes in addition no cracks were observed on the surface of the dried membranes by adding czn or using various drying solvents showing that they did not become brittle fig 5 shows the cross sectional images of all fabricated membranes in three different magnifications 2 00 and 5 00 kx with typical asymmetric structures including a finger like porous sub layer and a dense top layer by modifying the drying solvent some explicit changes in the specific diameter of the pores of the membranes dried from ethanol isopropanol and acetone in the cross sectional images of the 5 00 kx magnification could be observed so some significant growth the permeability of the mentioned membranes would be expected in contrast the czn addition in the optimum content 0 2 wt and the change in the drying temperature led to no significant changes in the fabricated membranes with regard to some drying solvents such as isopropanol and acetone 50 the finger like structure in the sub layer had the tendency to turn in to the macro void one as for the blended membranes the uniform dispersion of the czn nanocomposite in the polymeric dope solution as shown in the presented images confirmed the absence of the aggregation of the czn in the prepared membranes to confirm the existence and uniform dispersion of the czn composite in the pes matrix of the membranes x ray edx analysis was used fig 6 a shows the edx spectrum of the 0 2 wt czn nanocomposite pes membrane the presence of cu and zn elements in the mixed matrix of the pes membrane was recognized in addition fig 6b and c reveal the edx mapping of the cu and zn elements in the blended membranes respectively in fig 6d the red and green particles in the mixed map refer to the cu and zn elements the presented maps confirmed the uniform distribution of the czn nanocomposite in the matrix of the blended membranes incorporation of nanoparticles into the polymeric membranes can have some drawbacks one of the limiting factors is the dispersion of the nanoparticles in the polymers control of the aggregation dispersion behavior which is the first process for the preparation of new functional materials incorporating nanoparticles is very difficult for nanoparticles with less than 100 nm diameter due to surface interactions 45 the surface interactions that may take place when the nanoparticles in the polymeric solution can fulfill the stated conditions while researchers understand the surface interaction theories the factors contributing to enhancing or inducing the agglomerations remain unclear this causes difficulty in dispersing the nanoparticles during the membranes fabrication however yu et al 46 suggested that the increment in the concentration of nanoparticles could lead to an increase in the nanoparticles agglomeration besides benjamin et al 47 have suggested that the ionic strength and ph of the solution could also induce agglomeration between nanoparticles in particular wettability or hydrophilicity can have a significant impact on the flux rate fouling nature efficacy and shelf life of the membrane 48 to investigate the hydrophilicity and wettability of the bare and blended membranes dried from different solvents and temperatures water contact angle analysis was used and results are depicted in fig 7 as shown the effect of drying method on the contact angle is negligible however by adding the czn nanocomposite the hydrophilicity of the membranes is improved the wettability of the non ideal surfaces depends on several physicochemical properties of the substrate therefore the contact angle measurement is significantly influenced by the physical properties of the materials the effects of four main parameters including heterogeneity surface roughness particle size and particle shape were studied 49 particle size and particle shape over the surface are important parameters affecting the bulk density permeability porosity cohesion attrition and the interaction with the liquids shape and size considerations are normally applied to define some particle characteristics such as elongation effective surface area and roughness 50 the effects of these parameters on surface properties may cause variation in predicting the results in this regard kursun and ulusoy investigated the effect of particle shape with different mill timings on the wettability properties the shape of the milled particles was analyzed by the two dimensional sem images the results indicated that surface smoothness and elongation helped to increase the hydrophobicity whereas roughness and roundness caused an increase in hydrophilicity it was therefore proposed that the stronger interaction or adhesion force of particles resulted in larger contact areas and longer contact lines as compared with equivalent round particles 51 the shape and size of the particles could influence the structural and chemical properties of the substrate so we should consider these as the possible causes of the changes in wettability 3 2 control of the pores collapse for attuning permeability 3 2 1 the effect of czn participation and drying temperature the ultrafiltration performance of the pes membranes is related to the specific concentration of the czn added to the casting solution 30 according to our earlier study 33 the czn addition up to the optimum value 0 2 wt could result in the enhanced characteristics in the permeate flux and the antifouling behavior of the mixed matrix membranes a significant growth about 32 in the pure water flux was observed by adding a specific amount of the 0 2 wt czn to the pes casting solution to further investigate the effects of the czn addition in the specific value of 0 2 wt the bare and pes prepared membranes were dried by two different methods drying at room temperature and 70 c in the oven could be applied to achieve the dried membranes in order to conduct a comprehensive study on the czn addition to the polymeric matrix of the dried pes membrane as can be clearly seen in fig 8 czn addition to the pes polymeric solution caused a significant growth in the permeability of both pure water and fouling solution filtration the dried membrane at room temperature and 70 c so it could be concluded that using czn in the casting solution of the pes membrane in the optimum value resulted in the total growth of the pes membrane however the significant impact of the drying temperature was observed too as shown regarding the temperature of drying raising this temperature had a negative effect on the permeability of the dried bare pes membranes nevertheless the increasing trend in the drying temperature had a positive influence on the permeability of the blended membranes based on a simple comparison we could understand that the czn addition up to 0 2 wt and drying in the oven at 70 c had the best efficiency in terms of the pes membrane permeability to study the flux recovery ratio frr it should be noted that the permeability of the fabricated membranes is mutually related to the frr factor nonetheless for the nanocomposite membranes with the czn content of 0 2 wt no tangible differences were observed in the frr factor of the dried blended membranes made by different drying methods except the bare pes membrane dried in the oven at 70 c it could be concluded that increasing the drying temperature to higher degrees made the pes membranes more resistant to fouling presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of cuo zno surface could interact with pes chains and affect the resulted membrane properties there are possibility of formation of multiple hydrogen bonds i e first between the oh groups of the czn the h2o molecules and the sulfonic acid so3h groups as substituents of the pes polymer chains and secondary hydrogen bonding interactions between the sulfonic oso groups of the pes chains h2o and the oh groups of the czn 52 the formation of these hydrogen bonds could restrict the polymer chains mobility increase in the viscosity of casting solution and reduce in the diffusion rate between solvent and non solvent during the phase separation process 53 3 2 2 the effect of the drying solvent and temperature according to the previous studies 34 41 the solvent surface tension of filling the membrane pores before drying can influence the final membrane pore size to study this parameter on the pes membranes the solvent was changed from water to ethanol isopropanol and acetone 50 separately for about 24 h after membrane formation and the phase inversion process this was meant to modify the surface tension and get different degrees of collapsing in the polymeric matrix of the membranes in order to investigate the prepared dried membranes the fabricated bare membranes were tested as done in the previous section this can be clearly seen in fig 9 among four different solvents the membranes dried from all solvents should be looser than the water dried ones by the following order isopropanol ethanol acetone 50 water as it is obvious in fig 9 the solvent exchange had a noticeable effect on the permeability of the bare pes membranes in addition to the pure water flux growth this trend was observed in the fouling solution and the permeation test after fouling agent filtration however the flux recovery ratio frr was not changed perceptibly by changing the solvent for drying in the following figure fig 9 the effect of the drying temperature on changing the solvent of the bare pes is also presented as shown for almost all pes bare membranes dried in different solvents drying at the room temperature had a better effect on the permeability of the membranes than that in the oven at 70 c moreover we did not find any specific differences in the frr factor of the fabricated membranes dried at two different temperatures room temperature and 70 c when the drying solvent is difference from the water so it could be concluded that drying at room temperature might be appropriate for fabricating the pes membranes when they are dried in different organic solvents 3 3 membrane properties 3 3 1 permeability and hydrophilicity the pure water flux of the dried pes membranes is presented in fig 10 as can be seen the effect of the solvent exchange was more significant than nanoparticles participation 0 2 wt czn and the temperature of drying for the membranes dried from ethanol solvent exchange effects led to a remarkable modification and altered the pure water flux from 65 5 kg m2h to 297 4 kg m2h this resulted in the permeability growth of about 354 however raising temperature from the ambient temperature to 70 c had no positive effect on the pure water flux of the dried bare pes membrane we speculate that the less boiling point of ethanol relative to water made this difference the lower boiling point of alcohol resulted in the less affiliation of the membrane properties to the drying temperature regarding the nanocomposite participation 0 2 wt czn addition a similar trend happened although according to our previous study 30 adding czn in the optimum amount of 0 2 wt to the pes polymeric solution had a significant effect on the pure water flux of the wet blended membranes by changing the solvent to ethanol czn addition had an inverse effect on the permeability of the dried membrane despite the complete dispersion of czn in the pes matrix of the membrane the high cost of czn and the difficulty of the czn distribution in the pes polymeric solution forced us to omit czn participation in the ethanol dried membranes changing the solvent from water to isopropanol made a similar trend as ethanol solvent did on the other hand permeability growth was about 520 of that observed for the water dried membranes so it could be concluded that the effect of changing the solvent to isopropanol was greater as compared to ethanol fig 10 shows that membranes dried from acetone 50 were affected more by raising the temperature to draw an accurate conclusion regarding acetone 50 by changing the solvent we could observe that by this modification the pure water flux of the membranes grew twice more than the membranes dried in water at room temperature by raising the drying temperature for the wet membranes which had been brought out from the acetone 50 bath at room temperature to 70 c in the oven the pure water flux of the bare prepared membranes showed the growth of about 32 5 an inverse trend was continued in the czn participation the czn addition in the optimum value 0 2 wt to the pes polymeric solution which was dried from the acetone 50 solvent at room temperature and in the oven at 70 c resulted in the pure water flux improvement of about 173 3 and 273 1 in the bare pes membrane dried from water respectively according to fig 10 it is obvious that the drying temperature had no specific effect on the permeability of the nanomaterial blended pes membranes however in the case of the czn blended pes membrane dried in acetone 50 a significant difference in all permeation and fouling tests was observed so it could be concluded that regarding the czn mixed membranes the drying temperature made no sensible difference in the membrane efficiency therefore using oven and energy could not be suitable for these blended membranes the following parts show a general and separate investigation conducted to select the optimum fabricated membrane for further studies 3 3 2 antifouling performance one of the key disadvantages of the membrane operations is membrane fouling this phenomenon results in numerous difficulties such as flux decrease the increase of the operation pressure maintenance expenses and membrane replacement 11 therefore choosing the effective drying solvent and temperature can help us to maintain the membrane capacity of the wet membranes and to improve the antifouling capacity of the dried membranes to examine the fouling capacity of the dried bare and blended membranes the flux of the bsa solution was measured after the pure water flux alternatively as shown in fig 11 regarding the bare pes membrane dried from water raising the drying temperature had a positive influence on the bsa flux of the prepared membranes which was about 44 8 in the following the czn addition in a specific amount to the dope solution showed the relative growth of about 44 8 and 54 6 in comparison to the bare pes dried in water which had been dried in air and oven at 70 c respectively ethanol as a solvent for drying the pes membrane caused a significant growth in the antifouling property which was about 4 5 times more than that of the bare pes membrane dried in air in contrast the bare pes membrane dried after ethanol immersion had more resistance to fouling in comparison with a similar one blended with czn and dried in air or oven at 70 c changing the solvent from water to isopropanol led to a similar increasing trend as presented the intensity of this growth was more than using ethanol as the solvent modifying the final solvent from water to isopropanol improved the antifouling property by 4 75 times as compared with the water solvent regarding acetone 50 the increasing trend was totally different immersing the bare pes membranes in the acetone 50 solvent after the coagulation bath and phase inversion completion enhanced the antifouling capacity of it about 3 times in addition by raising the drying temperature to 70 c adding czn in the optimum value to the pes polymeric solution and finally realizing czn participation and drying in oven at 70 c in a simultaneous manner the growth of about 4 3 and 5 4 times occurred respectively in comparison to the bare pes dried in water the frr parameter was calculated to make a comparison between the prepared membranes the results are shown in fig 12 this figure shows that the frr of the bare pes membrane dried from water was increased to about 45 5 by raising the temperature from room temperature to 70 c it showed that raising the temperature in drying made the pores of the membrane tighter reducing the permeability and increasing the flux recovery ratio of the dried membranes in the referred situation dried from water blending the czn nanocomposite in the matrix of the pes polymer had no special effect on the frr factor however the czn blended membrane had more permeability in the case of the membranes dried from ethanol the frr factor of the fabricated bare pes membranes showed no important changes when compared with similar membranes dried from water nevertheless the czn addition in a specific amount 0 2 wt had a positive effect which was about 38 2 on the antifouling property in comparison to the bare one dried from water at the ambient temperature by changing the solvent from water to isopropanol a trend similar to that of ethanol solvent was observed the notable point was that czn participation in the optimum value 0 2 wt had the best effect on the frr factor the estimated percent for this factor was 98 9 this result was an unexpected value for the frr factor showing the high capacity of the new dried pes membrane in saving the primer properties of it by changing the final solvent from water to 50 acetone in the case of the bare pes membranes the obtained results were similar to those obtained by drying from water however the calculated frr factor showed an amazing result the referred factor had a growth of about 54 in comparison to the bare one dried from water according to the obtained results all of the prepared pes membranes rejected more than 90 of the fouling solution bsa protein whilst no cracks or defects were observed during the flux enhancement due to the change of the solvent or czn nanocomposite incorporation the bsa rejection was slightly increased by using the czn nanocomposite as an additive in the pes membrane matrix and raising the drying temperature 3 3 3 release of cu2 and zn2 from the membrane structure the amount of copper and zinc ion cu2 released from the 0 2 wt czn pes ultrafiltration membrane was measured by icp oes spectroscopy as expected cuo zno nanocomposite or cu2 and zn2 ions were hardly leached from the pes membrane structure so after the 120 h from immersion the released content of the cuo zno nanocomposite in the surrounding media was 5 ppb based on world health organization who in 2003 when the amount of this element is less than 30 ppm mg l it is entirely safe and no danger threats the human body therefore the cuo zno release from the 0 2 wt czn pes was in the defined safe range 4 conclusion regarding the ultrafiltration membranes the drying post fabrication process was found to be the most effective factor improving the separation performance of the dried pes membrane to manipulate the permeability and the antifouling property of the pes membrane three factors were investigated cuo zno incorporation at the optimum value of 0 2 wt in to the pes content of the polymeric dope solution temperature of drying and the solvent filling the pores before drying with increasing the drying temperature from the ambient one to 70 c in the oven a significant shift from more open membranes dried at room temperature to the tighter ones dried at 70 c oven was observed regarding cuo zno nanocomposite addition although this additive led to a remarkable growth in the permeability and antifouling properties such as the flux recovery ratio frr of the wet blended pes membranes the expected growth was not observed for the dried pes membranes obtained from different solvents the type of the solvent filling the membrane pores before drying also had pronounced effect on the performance of the dried membranes it was possible to improve the permeability of the fabricated membranes from 39 3 kg m2h to 406 kg m2h in terms of the ultrafiltration range for the membranes dried from water increasing the drying temperature had an adverse effect however this increase resulted in a desirable effect for the pes membranes dried from other solvents such as acetone 50 to summarize it is possible to further manipulate the antifouling property by increasing the drying temperature from the room one to 70 c when drying from the same solvent it should be noted that there were big differences in terms of the pure water and the antifouling property growth of the prepared membranes dried from different solvents water ethanol isopropanol and acetone 50 nonetheless this phenomenon is very complex and this is only a partial investigation that needs to be continued in the future acknowledgments the authors appreciate the university of tabriz iran and kharazmi university tehran also for all their supports also we acknowledge the kharazmi polymeric membrane research core 
14368,in this research three techniques to control the permeability and the antifouling property of microporous pes membranes fabricated by the phase inversion and posterior drying have been reported the three explored methods included incorporating the cuo zno nanomaterial in the pes matrix altering the solvents filling the pores before drying water ethanol isopropanol and 50 acetone water and changing the drying temperature from room temperature to 70 c based on the obtained results it was found that varying the drying solvents and increasing the drying temperature had a tangible effect on the permeability and antifouling property of the bare and blended polyethersulfone pes membranes this in turn resulted in improving the pure water flux from 39 3 to 406 kg m2h moreover addition of the cuo zno nanomaterial in the optimum content 0 2 wt to the pes matrix in wet membranes led to the growth of 47 2 in the permeability and the increase of the flux recovery ration frr to the highest value however this addition did not lead to the proposed effect in the case of the dried membranes keywords drying method polyethersulfone permeability improvement antifouling property cuo zno nanocomposite 1 introduction membrane separation process has been one of the widely used technologies in most industries and applications in the recent years some advantages such as high selectivity low energy cost operational simplicity and flexibility easy control scale up and the reduced use of chemicals have made this technology beneficial in numerous applications and operations 1 in the commercial scale ultrafiltration membranes for the referred applications are made from polyethersulfone pes polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and polysulfone psf 1 4 some of its prominent properties such as high thermal mechanical and chemical stability good resistance under heat aging and hydraulic stability have made pes an appropriate choice 5 having high permeability and flux to perform the separation test with the acceptable results is one of the main challenges encountered in preparing ultrafiltration membranes nonetheless membrane fouling phenomenon is a major disadvantage arising from the hydrophobic nature of the pes membranes including uf mf nf and reverse osmosis ro specific interactions between the components in the feed stream and the membrane can lead to membrane fouling resulting in a decline trend of permeability the collapse of the membrane structure and an increase in the cost of the membrane replacement 6 so applying a technique to reduce the fouling phenomenon is inevitable for the membranes fabrication various methods such as mixing with hydrophilic additives 2 7 11 blending with hydrophilic and amphiphilic polymers 12 employing cold plasma treatment 8 13 applying surface coating 14 15 use of nanomaterials 16 and using chemical grafting 17 have been considered to modify the membranes and reduce the fouling phenomenon incorporation of nanomaterials into the polymeric matrix of the membranes is the most widely used solution to improve the separation efficiency and fouling resistance 16 various inorganic nanomaterials such as copper cu 17 zinc zn 18 al2o3 19 zinc oxide zno 10 silver ag 20 tio2 21 c3n4 22 potassium perchlorate kclo4 2 ferrosoferric oxide fe3o4 9 zirconium dioxide zro2 19 23 carbon nanotubes cnt 24 and graphene 25 have been applied as additives to modify the pes membranes numerous advantages of some mineral nanoparticles like zno such as photocatalytic activity low cost and valuable antibacterial characteristics have made them appropriate additives 10 26 further adding the zno nanomaterials to the polymeric matrix of the membrane can remarkably increase the hydrophilicity of the nanocomposite membranes so modifying hydrophilicity can be the main reason to use appropriate materials in order to change this parameter of the polymeric membranes 26 the main sequence of zno blending in the membrane matrix is the positive modification of the physical and chemical properties of the nanocomposite membranes 27 previous researches on the zno nanoparticles can serve as a good guide for developing new usages in the membrane matrix to enhance the permeability and antifouling properties moreover copper oxide cuo can be one of the appropriate and hydrophilic choices among the wide range of nanoparticles not seriously considered as a factor to improve the membrane properties a combination of hydrophilic cuo and caco3 nanoparticles with 1 2 wt in the pvdf matrix was applied 31 this led to two main consequences notable enlargement of surface pores and the modification of the finger like layer to the thicker one to fabricate the polymeric membrane films the phase inversion procedure was used eventually a significant improvement in the properties of the new mixed matrix membrane was observed nuri akar et al 17 also used nanosized cu and se particles as additives to fabricate new ultrafiltration pes membranes the optimized blended membranes with the expected properties were obtained the 0 05 wt cu pes membranes rejected protein as much as 86 3 whereas better resistance to the loss of the pure water flux belonged to the se pes membrane based on our previous researches 28 30 adding various forms of these nanomaterials such as cuo cuo zno nanocomposite and amine functionalized cuo and zno nanoparticles could result in the appreciable growth of permeability and improvement in the antifouling and rejection properties of the blended pes membranes the presence of numerous oh groups on the zno nanoparticles surface has made them an influential option for use with such additives as cuo nanoparticles in the polymeric membrane matrix in addition regarding the distribution property of such nanocomposites it should be noted that the better distribution of them in the polymeric matrix could be an advantage as compared with the sole cuo and zno another benefit of the nanocomposite incorporation in the casting solution is decreasing the agglomeration occurring in the membrane matrix the effects of the addition of cuo and zno nanoparticles to the polymeric matrix of membrane in the individual and composite form have been investigated comprehensively in our previous studies 28 30 it has been concluded that the embedded membrane with the 0 2 wt cuo zno has the best growth in terms of permeability and antifouling resistance the phase inversion method is the most common method used for fabricating polymeric membranes four mains steps in this method include polymer dissolution in a suitable solvent casting solution conditions of film casting type and conditions of phase inversion and membrane post treatment 31 in order to modify the membrane performance some simple changes in the membrane preparation such as varying the composition of the polymeric solutions and conditions during the phase inversion coagulation bath and making a post treatment stage conditioning drying or crosslinking could be applied the morphology of the prepared membranes could be modified by choosing a non solvent a coagulation bath the point that should be considered is the exchange rate between the non solvent and the solvent during the phase inversion method the higher rate of this exchange results in the higher porosity of the fabricated membranes 32 vankelecom et al 33 used water n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp as a non solvent solvent pair to fabricate the polysulfone membranes it was found that the use of additives such as alcohol or dmf could change the rate of exchange between the non solvent solvent temperature is another factor which can influence the coagulation bath generally the higher coagulation bath temperature causes the higher rate of the solvent non solvent exchange creating a more porous structure 33 several post casting treatments such as temperature variation evaporation period air velocity when a convective flow is used and the relative humidity of the air can be effective on the membrane performance there are several post treatment methods which can help to stabilize and improve the membrane performance such as employing plasma treatment drying with the solvent replacement method immersing in concentrated mineral acids keeping the membrane in water or drying membranes 34 37 storing under wet conditions is common for the membranes fabricated by the wet phase inversion method this is because when the drying method is performed to prepare the membranes the structure of the membrane is changed collapses the collapse phenomenon is more obvious for uf and nf membranes the collapse of the nodular structure is the main result of the irreversible loss of the solvent permeance during drying 34 as a matter of fact to lessen the possibility of nodule collapse upon drying multiple solvent exchanging procedures can be absolutely effective in this procedure first the solvent is used to replace the residual non solvent maintained in the membrane after immersing in the coagulation bath in the next step the used non solvent is substituted by another volatile solvent with a lower boiling point which could be easily eliminated during evaporation to prepare the dried membrane 38 40 brown 41 introduced a theory to describe the nodular collapse during the film formation of polymer latex particles regarding pi ultrafiltration beerlage 34 also applied this theory and described a logical relation between the capillary forces fc and the deformation resistance of the matrix fr as brought up by brown to calculate fc eq 1 was applied where γ n m 2 is the surface tension of the gas liquid interface inside the pores a m2 is the cross sectional area of the pores θ deg is the measured contact angle between the membrane surface and the liquid and rp m is the pores radius furthermore fr can be calculated by eq 2 where e n m 2 is the tensile modulus of the polymer material that can be assumed as a measure of the pores wall elasticity based on this method the collapse of the nodular structure will happen if fc fr eq 3 1 f c 2 γ r p cos θ a 2 f r 0 37 e a so for any prepared membrane the pores will fall in if 3 2 γ cos θ r p 0 37 e it seems that if the strength of the membrane matrix is high enough due to minimizing the surface tension for example by changing the last solvent before evaporation it will be possible to keep the pore structure of the membrane i e to reduce the capillary force 34 38 39 41 42 in our previous work we presented cuo zno czn as a novel additive to the pes dope solution that study was a comprehensive investigation of the new blended membranes showing its excellent stability in the pure water flux and its antifouling property according to our findings the optimum amount of czn addition to the pes solution was about 0 2 wt 30 meanwhile other factors such as membrane post treatment procedures and the specific temperature of the drying method can make a significant difference in the membrane performance it should be noted that the drying step is vital to maintain the performance of the membrane in the wet condition 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials zncl2 cuso4 5h2o and naoh and the applied drying solvents such as ethanol isopropanol and acetone were all purchased from the merck company germany to provide the other essential materials such as dimethylacetamide dmac polyethylene glycol peg mw 4000 g mole and bovine serum albumin bsa mw 67 000 g mole sigma aldrich company was chosen also polyethersulfone pes ultrason e6020 p with mw 58 000 g mole was gained from basf co germany 2 2 fabrication of the cuo zno nanocomposite the procedure for the cuo zno nanocomposite synthesis has been extensively presented in our previous work 30 to put it briefly for the preparation of the aqueous medium a glass plate reaction plate was filled by 30 ml of distilled water and naoh granuls were added to water to obtain the 10 0 mol l naoh solution then zncl2 2 0 mmol and cuso4 5h2o 1 0 mmol were mixed with the naoh solution as the next step a sealed glass bottle was selected to maintain the obtained solution in an oven at 80 c for 24 h subsequently to gain the natural sediment it had to be cooled down finally to get the pure solid the possible residual had to eliminate the block one to do this purification distilled water and alcohol were used to wash the sediment the gained sediment had to be kept at 80 c for 12 h to ensure the dryness of it 2 3 fabrication of the bare and blended membranes the steps and method followed for the preparation of the nanocomposite membranes by the non solvent induced phase separation nips have been reported in our previous work 30 the compositions of the membranes included 18 wt pes polymer 2 wt peg 4000 relative to the total membrane dmac as the solvent for the bare membrane and the 0 2 wt cuo zno nanocomposite for the blended membrane 30 for further dispersion of the nanoparticles after degassing the dissolved polymeric solution a sonicated bath was used for the nanocomposites dispersion to cast the casting solutions on the nonwoven sheets an applicator with 150 μm thickness was applied the water coagulation bath 25 c was used to solidify the formed film in it instantly the prepared membranes were kept in distilled water for 12 h before testing three solvents were used as the exchange solvents ethanol isopropanol and 50 acetone 50 water for the drying method one of the key points was the immersion time in the second solvent this time was selected to be 30 min for the fabricated membranes to ensure water evacuation from the formed pores finally the membranes were left to be dried at the ambient temperature or 70 c in an oven all steps in the membrane preparation were followed at room temperature with the relative humidity rh of about 30 40 2 4 membrane characterization 2 4 1 scanning electron microscopy sem in order to recognize the membranes morphology tescan sem czech republic was applied to take the sem images the membrane samples had to be prepared liquid nitrogen was used to rigidify the samples for a few seconds by immersing the prepared membranes in it and breaking them for the cross sectional images to provide enough conductivity for samples all of the prepared membranes were covered with gold and the images were recorded at 20 kv 2 4 2 quality of the nanoparticles distribution within the membrane layers in order to further investigate the nanoparticles distribution in the membranes depth direction electron dispersion spectroscopy edx was employed the special instrument for edx analysis was an oxford inca energy 250 edx 2 4 3 contact angle measurement to specify the surface hydrophilicity of the fabricated membranes a contact angle goniometer g10 kruss germany was applied the sessile drop method was used to measure the contact angle of the prepared membranes at the constant temperature and humidity 25 c and 50 respectively to determine the contact angles in the static mode a specific volume of water was intently dropped on the top surface of the membranes to get more accurate results ten random spots of the membrane surfaces were chosen to measure the contact angle under the same condition 2 5 membrane performance to test the fabricated membranes an active membrane area of 19 6 cm2 was cut and put in the batch type dead end system before starting the performance test the dried membranes were soaked in the deionized water for 30 min to return part of the wettability of the prepared membrane the sufficient force was required to drive the liquid through the dead end cell so a nitrogen gas capsule was connected to a pressure regulator and a gauge to provide this pressure to provide the required turbulence all cells were equipped with a string system with 300 rpm rotation for the first step to ensure the suitable stability of the membrane for further permeation tests a compression process had to be done the authenticated pressure for this compaction step was 0 5 mpa the period of compression was equal for all of the performed tests and this duration was 30 min in the second step to evaluate the permeation experiments the operation pressure was 0 3 mpa at the room temperature 2 5 1 permeability criterion of the pure water flux of the membranes is the weight of the collected water every 5 min the weight of the collected permeate was recorded during 90 min automatically to get the most accuracy each of the membranes was tested at least 6 times the pure water flux jw 1 was estimated by the following equation 4 j w 1 m a t where m kg is the weight of the collected permeate a m2 is the effective area of the tested membrane and t h is the time of the permeation process 2 5 2 rejection since the dairy industry is the most important application of the uf membranes the rejection ability of the fabricated membranes is vital meanwhile protein filtration is a suitable technique to survey this parameter bsa protein is one of the popular agents and standard methods used for the rejection and antifouling tests to determine this parameter in the bsa filtration test the last drops of the permeate and adequate amounts of retentate were collected and sealed separately then to determine the concentration of bsa a uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr 2000 usa was applied to calculate the bsa rejection eq 5 was applied as a formula 5 r 1 c c 0 100 where c and c0 are the bsa concentrations in the permeate and retentate mg l respectively 2 6 antifouling tests to comprehensively investigate the antifouling capacity of the uf membrane flux recovery ratio frr was used for this test the bsa solution 500 mg l was prepared in proper amounts and replaced by pure water after jw 1 kg m2h determination to gain the foulant flux jp kg m2h at the pressure of 0 3 mpa and with the rotation speed of 300 rpm after finishing the fouling test to eliminate any probable reversible fouling on the membrane surface the cells were evacuated and the tested membranes were removed and submerged in the water bath for 20 min in the next part jw 2 kg m2h was determined under the same process conditions to filter the pure water for the second time immediately after tanking and membrane washing with distilled water finally the following equation was applied to estimate the frr of the membranes 29 6 f r r j w 2 j w 1 100 2 7 copper and zinc release inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp oes arcos eop germany was applied to investigate the release behavior of the cuo zno nanocomposite from the 0 2 wt czn pes mixed matrix membrane accordingly five samples of the chosen membrane were cut in a certain area 1 cm 1 cm and immersed in 10 ml of milli q water at room temperature independently 24 48 72 96 and 120 h after immersion the membrane was taken out and the remaining liquid was poured into a special container during five days separately 44 finally the cu content of the collected liquids was measured by icp oes 3 results and discussion ftir spectrum xrd pattern and sem micrograph were applied to characterize the cuo zno nanocomposite as presented in our previous paper 30 confirming the synthesis of these nanoparticles all results related to characterizations were compatible with the literature 43 3 1 characterization of the membranes 3 1 1 surface characteristics of the bare and czn blended pes membranes to explore the effect of czn addition with an optimum amount of 0 2 wt by changing the drying solvent and the drying temperature on the structure of the pes membranes sem images were applied the surface sem images of the prepared membranes in the resolutions of 15 kx are displayed in figs 1 4 the specific difference between these four figures was in different drying solvents used which were estimated to have the major effect on the dried membrane properties with the inorganic addition czn the change of the drying solvent from water to ethanol isopropanol and acetone 50 and the increase of the drying temperature from the ambient temperature to 70 c the smooth surface of the fabricated membranes was retained it should be noted that mass or lump could not be seen on the surface of the blended membranes in addition no cracks were observed on the surface of the dried membranes by adding czn or using various drying solvents showing that they did not become brittle fig 5 shows the cross sectional images of all fabricated membranes in three different magnifications 2 00 and 5 00 kx with typical asymmetric structures including a finger like porous sub layer and a dense top layer by modifying the drying solvent some explicit changes in the specific diameter of the pores of the membranes dried from ethanol isopropanol and acetone in the cross sectional images of the 5 00 kx magnification could be observed so some significant growth the permeability of the mentioned membranes would be expected in contrast the czn addition in the optimum content 0 2 wt and the change in the drying temperature led to no significant changes in the fabricated membranes with regard to some drying solvents such as isopropanol and acetone 50 the finger like structure in the sub layer had the tendency to turn in to the macro void one as for the blended membranes the uniform dispersion of the czn nanocomposite in the polymeric dope solution as shown in the presented images confirmed the absence of the aggregation of the czn in the prepared membranes to confirm the existence and uniform dispersion of the czn composite in the pes matrix of the membranes x ray edx analysis was used fig 6 a shows the edx spectrum of the 0 2 wt czn nanocomposite pes membrane the presence of cu and zn elements in the mixed matrix of the pes membrane was recognized in addition fig 6b and c reveal the edx mapping of the cu and zn elements in the blended membranes respectively in fig 6d the red and green particles in the mixed map refer to the cu and zn elements the presented maps confirmed the uniform distribution of the czn nanocomposite in the matrix of the blended membranes incorporation of nanoparticles into the polymeric membranes can have some drawbacks one of the limiting factors is the dispersion of the nanoparticles in the polymers control of the aggregation dispersion behavior which is the first process for the preparation of new functional materials incorporating nanoparticles is very difficult for nanoparticles with less than 100 nm diameter due to surface interactions 45 the surface interactions that may take place when the nanoparticles in the polymeric solution can fulfill the stated conditions while researchers understand the surface interaction theories the factors contributing to enhancing or inducing the agglomerations remain unclear this causes difficulty in dispersing the nanoparticles during the membranes fabrication however yu et al 46 suggested that the increment in the concentration of nanoparticles could lead to an increase in the nanoparticles agglomeration besides benjamin et al 47 have suggested that the ionic strength and ph of the solution could also induce agglomeration between nanoparticles in particular wettability or hydrophilicity can have a significant impact on the flux rate fouling nature efficacy and shelf life of the membrane 48 to investigate the hydrophilicity and wettability of the bare and blended membranes dried from different solvents and temperatures water contact angle analysis was used and results are depicted in fig 7 as shown the effect of drying method on the contact angle is negligible however by adding the czn nanocomposite the hydrophilicity of the membranes is improved the wettability of the non ideal surfaces depends on several physicochemical properties of the substrate therefore the contact angle measurement is significantly influenced by the physical properties of the materials the effects of four main parameters including heterogeneity surface roughness particle size and particle shape were studied 49 particle size and particle shape over the surface are important parameters affecting the bulk density permeability porosity cohesion attrition and the interaction with the liquids shape and size considerations are normally applied to define some particle characteristics such as elongation effective surface area and roughness 50 the effects of these parameters on surface properties may cause variation in predicting the results in this regard kursun and ulusoy investigated the effect of particle shape with different mill timings on the wettability properties the shape of the milled particles was analyzed by the two dimensional sem images the results indicated that surface smoothness and elongation helped to increase the hydrophobicity whereas roughness and roundness caused an increase in hydrophilicity it was therefore proposed that the stronger interaction or adhesion force of particles resulted in larger contact areas and longer contact lines as compared with equivalent round particles 51 the shape and size of the particles could influence the structural and chemical properties of the substrate so we should consider these as the possible causes of the changes in wettability 3 2 control of the pores collapse for attuning permeability 3 2 1 the effect of czn participation and drying temperature the ultrafiltration performance of the pes membranes is related to the specific concentration of the czn added to the casting solution 30 according to our earlier study 33 the czn addition up to the optimum value 0 2 wt could result in the enhanced characteristics in the permeate flux and the antifouling behavior of the mixed matrix membranes a significant growth about 32 in the pure water flux was observed by adding a specific amount of the 0 2 wt czn to the pes casting solution to further investigate the effects of the czn addition in the specific value of 0 2 wt the bare and pes prepared membranes were dried by two different methods drying at room temperature and 70 c in the oven could be applied to achieve the dried membranes in order to conduct a comprehensive study on the czn addition to the polymeric matrix of the dried pes membrane as can be clearly seen in fig 8 czn addition to the pes polymeric solution caused a significant growth in the permeability of both pure water and fouling solution filtration the dried membrane at room temperature and 70 c so it could be concluded that using czn in the casting solution of the pes membrane in the optimum value resulted in the total growth of the pes membrane however the significant impact of the drying temperature was observed too as shown regarding the temperature of drying raising this temperature had a negative effect on the permeability of the dried bare pes membranes nevertheless the increasing trend in the drying temperature had a positive influence on the permeability of the blended membranes based on a simple comparison we could understand that the czn addition up to 0 2 wt and drying in the oven at 70 c had the best efficiency in terms of the pes membrane permeability to study the flux recovery ratio frr it should be noted that the permeability of the fabricated membranes is mutually related to the frr factor nonetheless for the nanocomposite membranes with the czn content of 0 2 wt no tangible differences were observed in the frr factor of the dried blended membranes made by different drying methods except the bare pes membrane dried in the oven at 70 c it could be concluded that increasing the drying temperature to higher degrees made the pes membranes more resistant to fouling presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of cuo zno surface could interact with pes chains and affect the resulted membrane properties there are possibility of formation of multiple hydrogen bonds i e first between the oh groups of the czn the h2o molecules and the sulfonic acid so3h groups as substituents of the pes polymer chains and secondary hydrogen bonding interactions between the sulfonic oso groups of the pes chains h2o and the oh groups of the czn 52 the formation of these hydrogen bonds could restrict the polymer chains mobility increase in the viscosity of casting solution and reduce in the diffusion rate between solvent and non solvent during the phase separation process 53 3 2 2 the effect of the drying solvent and temperature according to the previous studies 34 41 the solvent surface tension of filling the membrane pores before drying can influence the final membrane pore size to study this parameter on the pes membranes the solvent was changed from water to ethanol isopropanol and acetone 50 separately for about 24 h after membrane formation and the phase inversion process this was meant to modify the surface tension and get different degrees of collapsing in the polymeric matrix of the membranes in order to investigate the prepared dried membranes the fabricated bare membranes were tested as done in the previous section this can be clearly seen in fig 9 among four different solvents the membranes dried from all solvents should be looser than the water dried ones by the following order isopropanol ethanol acetone 50 water as it is obvious in fig 9 the solvent exchange had a noticeable effect on the permeability of the bare pes membranes in addition to the pure water flux growth this trend was observed in the fouling solution and the permeation test after fouling agent filtration however the flux recovery ratio frr was not changed perceptibly by changing the solvent for drying in the following figure fig 9 the effect of the drying temperature on changing the solvent of the bare pes is also presented as shown for almost all pes bare membranes dried in different solvents drying at the room temperature had a better effect on the permeability of the membranes than that in the oven at 70 c moreover we did not find any specific differences in the frr factor of the fabricated membranes dried at two different temperatures room temperature and 70 c when the drying solvent is difference from the water so it could be concluded that drying at room temperature might be appropriate for fabricating the pes membranes when they are dried in different organic solvents 3 3 membrane properties 3 3 1 permeability and hydrophilicity the pure water flux of the dried pes membranes is presented in fig 10 as can be seen the effect of the solvent exchange was more significant than nanoparticles participation 0 2 wt czn and the temperature of drying for the membranes dried from ethanol solvent exchange effects led to a remarkable modification and altered the pure water flux from 65 5 kg m2h to 297 4 kg m2h this resulted in the permeability growth of about 354 however raising temperature from the ambient temperature to 70 c had no positive effect on the pure water flux of the dried bare pes membrane we speculate that the less boiling point of ethanol relative to water made this difference the lower boiling point of alcohol resulted in the less affiliation of the membrane properties to the drying temperature regarding the nanocomposite participation 0 2 wt czn addition a similar trend happened although according to our previous study 30 adding czn in the optimum amount of 0 2 wt to the pes polymeric solution had a significant effect on the pure water flux of the wet blended membranes by changing the solvent to ethanol czn addition had an inverse effect on the permeability of the dried membrane despite the complete dispersion of czn in the pes matrix of the membrane the high cost of czn and the difficulty of the czn distribution in the pes polymeric solution forced us to omit czn participation in the ethanol dried membranes changing the solvent from water to isopropanol made a similar trend as ethanol solvent did on the other hand permeability growth was about 520 of that observed for the water dried membranes so it could be concluded that the effect of changing the solvent to isopropanol was greater as compared to ethanol fig 10 shows that membranes dried from acetone 50 were affected more by raising the temperature to draw an accurate conclusion regarding acetone 50 by changing the solvent we could observe that by this modification the pure water flux of the membranes grew twice more than the membranes dried in water at room temperature by raising the drying temperature for the wet membranes which had been brought out from the acetone 50 bath at room temperature to 70 c in the oven the pure water flux of the bare prepared membranes showed the growth of about 32 5 an inverse trend was continued in the czn participation the czn addition in the optimum value 0 2 wt to the pes polymeric solution which was dried from the acetone 50 solvent at room temperature and in the oven at 70 c resulted in the pure water flux improvement of about 173 3 and 273 1 in the bare pes membrane dried from water respectively according to fig 10 it is obvious that the drying temperature had no specific effect on the permeability of the nanomaterial blended pes membranes however in the case of the czn blended pes membrane dried in acetone 50 a significant difference in all permeation and fouling tests was observed so it could be concluded that regarding the czn mixed membranes the drying temperature made no sensible difference in the membrane efficiency therefore using oven and energy could not be suitable for these blended membranes the following parts show a general and separate investigation conducted to select the optimum fabricated membrane for further studies 3 3 2 antifouling performance one of the key disadvantages of the membrane operations is membrane fouling this phenomenon results in numerous difficulties such as flux decrease the increase of the operation pressure maintenance expenses and membrane replacement 11 therefore choosing the effective drying solvent and temperature can help us to maintain the membrane capacity of the wet membranes and to improve the antifouling capacity of the dried membranes to examine the fouling capacity of the dried bare and blended membranes the flux of the bsa solution was measured after the pure water flux alternatively as shown in fig 11 regarding the bare pes membrane dried from water raising the drying temperature had a positive influence on the bsa flux of the prepared membranes which was about 44 8 in the following the czn addition in a specific amount to the dope solution showed the relative growth of about 44 8 and 54 6 in comparison to the bare pes dried in water which had been dried in air and oven at 70 c respectively ethanol as a solvent for drying the pes membrane caused a significant growth in the antifouling property which was about 4 5 times more than that of the bare pes membrane dried in air in contrast the bare pes membrane dried after ethanol immersion had more resistance to fouling in comparison with a similar one blended with czn and dried in air or oven at 70 c changing the solvent from water to isopropanol led to a similar increasing trend as presented the intensity of this growth was more than using ethanol as the solvent modifying the final solvent from water to isopropanol improved the antifouling property by 4 75 times as compared with the water solvent regarding acetone 50 the increasing trend was totally different immersing the bare pes membranes in the acetone 50 solvent after the coagulation bath and phase inversion completion enhanced the antifouling capacity of it about 3 times in addition by raising the drying temperature to 70 c adding czn in the optimum value to the pes polymeric solution and finally realizing czn participation and drying in oven at 70 c in a simultaneous manner the growth of about 4 3 and 5 4 times occurred respectively in comparison to the bare pes dried in water the frr parameter was calculated to make a comparison between the prepared membranes the results are shown in fig 12 this figure shows that the frr of the bare pes membrane dried from water was increased to about 45 5 by raising the temperature from room temperature to 70 c it showed that raising the temperature in drying made the pores of the membrane tighter reducing the permeability and increasing the flux recovery ratio of the dried membranes in the referred situation dried from water blending the czn nanocomposite in the matrix of the pes polymer had no special effect on the frr factor however the czn blended membrane had more permeability in the case of the membranes dried from ethanol the frr factor of the fabricated bare pes membranes showed no important changes when compared with similar membranes dried from water nevertheless the czn addition in a specific amount 0 2 wt had a positive effect which was about 38 2 on the antifouling property in comparison to the bare one dried from water at the ambient temperature by changing the solvent from water to isopropanol a trend similar to that of ethanol solvent was observed the notable point was that czn participation in the optimum value 0 2 wt had the best effect on the frr factor the estimated percent for this factor was 98 9 this result was an unexpected value for the frr factor showing the high capacity of the new dried pes membrane in saving the primer properties of it by changing the final solvent from water to 50 acetone in the case of the bare pes membranes the obtained results were similar to those obtained by drying from water however the calculated frr factor showed an amazing result the referred factor had a growth of about 54 in comparison to the bare one dried from water according to the obtained results all of the prepared pes membranes rejected more than 90 of the fouling solution bsa protein whilst no cracks or defects were observed during the flux enhancement due to the change of the solvent or czn nanocomposite incorporation the bsa rejection was slightly increased by using the czn nanocomposite as an additive in the pes membrane matrix and raising the drying temperature 3 3 3 release of cu2 and zn2 from the membrane structure the amount of copper and zinc ion cu2 released from the 0 2 wt czn pes ultrafiltration membrane was measured by icp oes spectroscopy as expected cuo zno nanocomposite or cu2 and zn2 ions were hardly leached from the pes membrane structure so after the 120 h from immersion the released content of the cuo zno nanocomposite in the surrounding media was 5 ppb based on world health organization who in 2003 when the amount of this element is less than 30 ppm mg l it is entirely safe and no danger threats the human body therefore the cuo zno release from the 0 2 wt czn pes was in the defined safe range 4 conclusion regarding the ultrafiltration membranes the drying post fabrication process was found to be the most effective factor improving the separation performance of the dried pes membrane to manipulate the permeability and the antifouling property of the pes membrane three factors were investigated cuo zno incorporation at the optimum value of 0 2 wt in to the pes content of the polymeric dope solution temperature of drying and the solvent filling the pores before drying with increasing the drying temperature from the ambient one to 70 c in the oven a significant shift from more open membranes dried at room temperature to the tighter ones dried at 70 c oven was observed regarding cuo zno nanocomposite addition although this additive led to a remarkable growth in the permeability and antifouling properties such as the flux recovery ratio frr of the wet blended pes membranes the expected growth was not observed for the dried pes membranes obtained from different solvents the type of the solvent filling the membrane pores before drying also had pronounced effect on the performance of the dried membranes it was possible to improve the permeability of the fabricated membranes from 39 3 kg m2h to 406 kg m2h in terms of the ultrafiltration range for the membranes dried from water increasing the drying temperature had an adverse effect however this increase resulted in a desirable effect for the pes membranes dried from other solvents such as acetone 50 to summarize it is possible to further manipulate the antifouling property by increasing the drying temperature from the room one to 70 c when drying from the same solvent it should be noted that there were big differences in terms of the pure water and the antifouling property growth of the prepared membranes dried from different solvents water ethanol isopropanol and acetone 50

kharazmi university tehran also for all their supports also we acknowledge the kharazmi polymeric membrane research core

the modified starch possessed distinctive features scanning electron micrograph showed that the flocs formed using alum modified cassava peel starch was highly compacted clusters with appearance of e coli cells embedded in the floc matrix whereas for alum as the sole coagulant the flocs were irregular shaped and aggregated besides the difference in peak occurrence from analysis reflected different mechanisms of floc formation using alum alone and alum modified cassava peel starch from the floc analysis study charge neutralisation bridging and sweep flocculation were the mechanisms that are expected to govern the coagulation and flocculation process keywords coagulation flocculation natural coagulant cassava peel starch modified starch charge neutralisation 1 introduction water is an integral part of the environment that is needed by all organisms to maintain their survival water is a vital element for socioeconomic development and equally important to preserve environmental sustainability malaysia is a fortunate country located immediately on the north of the equator that has a tropical rainforest climate therefore this nation is privileged to be humid and rainy throughout the year 1 water resources in malaysia are considered as abundantly available nonetheless the resources are becoming very limited in its pure state due to massive urbanisation and increasing population growth the quality of surface water is usually influenced by external inputs approaching into the reservoir from the water shed as well as from nutrient cycling and internal loading the external inputs discharged from point and non point sources can be in the form of organic and inorganic pollutants and nutrients 2 among various contaminants intruded into surface water suspended solids and bacteria such as escherichia coli are mostly common suspended solids that are commonly present in the water body due to natural occurrence can also be contributed by earthworks and land clearing activities these colloidal particles include organic materials such as algae and inorganic materials such as silt and sediment meanwhile the potential sources of bacterial contamination vary but usually come from grazing livestock poultry waste as well as untreated waste discharge from nearby residential settlements 3 consequently interventions in water treatment sanitation and hygiene are crucial to ensure water impurities can be removed efficiently prior to discharge into receiving bodies conventional surface water treatment plants have an equitable standard sequence of processes and the most important stage is coagulation and flocculation processes 4 the significance of coagulation process lies on its ability to settle very fine colloidal particles that are generally unable to settle under natural gravity condition cationic salts such as aluminium chloride aluminium sulfate ferric chloride ferric sulfate as well as polyaluminium chloride are typically used as the primary coagulants in many developed countries although the coagulation efficiency of using these chemical coagulants is well proven their efficiency in removing bacteria is not well documented most microorganisms in surface water are usually controlled by the addition of disinfectants at the later stage after coagulation however in recent years since water quality has seriously deteriorated due to intense anthropogenic activities larger dosage of coagulants and disinfectants are required in treating water to comply with national drinking water standards 5 this situation implicates not only towards elevating treatment expenses but also possibly triggers greater risk of secondary pollution with adverse consequences on human health such as disinfection of by products produced during chlorine disinfection 6 7 additionally excessive dosage of chemical coagulant increased the amount of residual metals and potentially released noxious polymeric monomers in treated water 7 8 in line with emerging awareness on the health effect carried by chemical coagulants intense focus has been given towards natural polymer based coagulants partial substitution of chemical coagulants with natural polymer based coagulants would certainly decrease aluminium residue in treated water however according to niquette et al 9 modification of coagulation conditions due to coagulant replacement may impair pathogen breakout in drinking water controlling possible consequences caused by microbial contamination is of extreme importance and must never be compromised 10 therefore a dual function agent for water treatment with high flocculation efficiency and antibacterial properties is needed to produce safe drinking water in all raw water conditions the continuous search for potential antimicrobial agents with coagulation ability has led to the identification of antimicrobial biomaterials based on polymers or their composites in recent years the modification of starch polymer has been explored as a way of combining their best attributes with those of synthetic polymers various modification techniques including oxidisation graft copolymerisation and etherification techniques allow one to chemically change starch polymer by introducing functional groups which leads to new starch products with dual properties flocculating and antibacterial abilities 11 unfortunately the use of acrylamide dimethylamine and epichlorohydrin as the common grafting monomers in the modification techniques has limit their application in some countries through legal restrictions due to their toxicity and carcinogenic effects 12 in many years the antibacterial property found in the extract of lemongrass has been elucidated from various researches with promising results 13 15 α citral geranial and β citral neral are among the major bioactive compounds that contribute to the antimicrobial activity of the extracts these components possess the ability to inhibit the growth of both gram positive and gram negative bacteria 14 however to the best of our knowledge there is no literature describing the potential of incorporating lemongrass extract in cassava peel starch cps to remove total suspended solids tss and e coli in raw water cassava peel waste is available in abundance at no cost from local small industries and it is a renewable precursor therefore in the present study a new flocculant was synthesised using starch isolated from cassava peel waste followed by modification using lemongrass extract to produce a modified coagulant to be used in combination with alum in order to enhance the removal of tss and e coli in raw water 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection of dam water dam water was collected from an intake tank of sembrong barat water treatment plant johor malaysia the physicochemical characteristics of the dam water are shown in table 1 2 2 isolation of starch cassava peels were obtained from local food industries around parit raja johor malaysia initially 100 g of selected peels were washed and the periderm layers were peeled off then the peels were diced into smaller pieces and homogenised in 200 ml of distilled water using a blender 16 17 after that 2 l of distilled water was added to the suspension and stirred for 2 min the slurry was then filtered through muslin cloth and the filtrate was left to sediment for 2 h subsequently the supernatant was discarded and the starch sediment was collected the isolated starch was subjected to sun drying for at least 24 h until it reached a constant weight dried cps was kept in an airtight container for further experimental use 2 3 isolation of lemongrass extract lemongrass stalks were purchased from local markets around parit raja johor malaysia 500 g of lemongrass stalks were fragmented into pieces of 10 mm length and dried in an oven at 60 c for 72 h to remove moisture content the dried samples were then crushed using a domestic blender to increase surface area 18 19 the samples were stored in an airtight bottle for usage in subsequent extraction process 15 g of crushed lemongrass samples were added into extraction thimbles 200 ml of solvents 95 ethanol and 95 methanol were added into different round bottom flasks extraction using soxhlet apparatus was done for 7 h at 70 c after the extraction was completed the extracts were distilled off at 65 c using a rotary evaporator the final extracts were stored in airtight amber glass bottles at 4 c for further analysis 20 21 2 4 synthesis of modified cassava peel starch the synthesis of modified cassava peel starch mcps was performed by adopting starch treatment method from palacios fonseca et al 22 with a slight adaptation by incorporating lemongrass extract as the modification monomer 25 g of native cps was suspended in 100 ml of 100 lemongrass extract the suspension was stirred at 150 rpm for 1 h at 25 c followed by the addition of 1 ml of concentrated 36 by weight hydrochloric acid hcl the reaction was allowed to proceed at 25 c for 24 h with continuous stirring at 150 rpm the reaction was terminated by adding 14 ml of 1 m sodium bicarbonate nahco3 into the mixture the suspension was cooled in an ice bath for 5 min starch precipitate was separated from the liquid residue by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min subsequently the supernatant was removed and starch pellet was sun dried until it reached a constant weight the modified starch was finally stored as solid powders to achieve long term shelf stability 2 5 starch characterisation the morphology and elemental distribution of native cps and mcps were analysed using scanning electron microscopy electron dispersive x ray spectrometry sem edx jeol jsm japan the infrared spectra of native cps and mcps were recorded with a fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer perkin elmer spectrum 100 usa the spectra were recorded in the wavenumber range from 400 to 4000 cm 1 the structure of the compounds in both starches was determined using 1h nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 1h nmr bruker avance model drx 500 germany using heavy water d2o as solvent and the range of chemical shift was measured between 0 and 10 ppm 2 6 preparation of stock solutions 1 g of cps mcps powder was suspended in 1 l of distilled water to produce cps mcps stock solution of 1 g l a uniform mixture was attained by continuous stirring of the suspension for 1 h at room temperature 4 5 g of analytical grade aluminium sulphate al2 so4 3 18h2o merck was employed in this study to prepare alum stock solution the metal salt was dissolved in 1 l of distilled water and then further diluted with distilled water to achieve the intended concentrations 2 7 coagulation and flocculation studies a standard flocculator equipped with 6 paddles velp italy was employed in this study all 6 beakers were filled with 1 l of water samples the ph of water samples was measured using a portable ph meter eutech ph adjustment was done using 0 1 m hcl merck and 0 1 m sodium hydroxide naoh merck an optimisation study was performed under three sets of experimental conditions i alum as a sole coagulant ii a combination of alum cps and iii a combination of alum mcps as dual coagulants when the dual coagulant mode was used cps mcps was added 30 s after alum was added 23 all parameters subjected for the optimisation study and the working range used are summarised in table 2 for each jar test performed a rapid stirring period was set for 1 min at 200 rpm followed by 2 min at 100 rpm subsequently a slow stirring period was conducted for 30 min at reduced speed of 25 rpm upon completion of settling time water samples were collected at 2 cm below the surface level tss measurement of the treated water was done using a hach dr 6000 spectrophotometer by adopting photometric method each experimental run was repeated in three replicates n 3 the coagulation efficiency of each experimental run was represented by tss removal as shown in the following equation 1 tss removal ts s i ts s f ts s i 100 where tssi and tssf are the initial and final tss values mg l respectively in all jar test performed sub samples were also taken for final e coli count the samples were diluted in sterile 0 1 peptone water to 101 102 and 103 1 ml of the diluted samples was cultured on each chromocult agar plate 24 25 precipitated flocs were harvested and subjected to ftir spectroscopy for chemical functional group analysis and sem edx for surface morphology and elemental distribution analysis 2 8 floc analysis samples of the coagulant flocs were analysed using special instrumentation sem edx spectrophotometry was used to analyse the morphology of flocs whereas the infrared spectra of flocs were analysed using an ftir spectrometer perkin elmer spectrum 100 usa from 400 to 4000 cm 1 2 9 statistical analysis all data were subjected to analysis of variance anova a p value lower than 0 05 indicates that the data are considered to be statistically significant 3 results discussion 3 1 starch characterisation 3 1 1 sem edx analysis the surface morphology and edx spectrum of alum are presented in fig 1 as can be seen solid particles formed agglomerates made of crystals from different sizes the average size of alum agglomerates was around 40 60 μm similar to the observation reported by 26 surface elemental distribution reflected by edx spectrometry confirmed the absence of any impurity in the alum sample used as primary coagulant in the present study morphology and surface elemental distribution of native and mcps are presented in figs 2 and 3 respectively both starches indicated polygonal and spherical starch granules with clearly defined ridges that appeared to mark sites where granules were in close contact with one another 27 28 moreover starch granules of native cps were observed to be smoother with no evidence of cracks due to low level damage during starch isolation process 29 the edx analysis done on the native cps only identified the presence of prominent c and o peaks which confirmed the supposition that the starch granules are purely made up of carbohydrate monomers meanwhile the microscopic analysis of mcps showed noticeable rough surface and wave like creases which might be due to penetration of hcl through channels and cavities of the starch granules during the modification process as observed by palacios fonseca et al 22 and van hung et al 30 however it was observed that the modification method did not severely affect the morphological characteristics of the starch granules where no depression cracks or hollow granules were observed apparently as observed in the edx spectrum of mcps presented in fig 3 significant percentages of new elements of na cl k and ca were detected the appearance of these elements in mcps indicated the occurrence of modification and proved that lemongrass extract and hcl were grafted onto cps the modification of starch using lemongrass extract had superimposed the surface elemental characteristic of mcps which indicated the increasing possibility of antibacterial property and metal binding ability in different parts of the coagulant increasing level of chlorine potentially increase bacteriacidal effect of the material as reported by maharjan et al 31 meanwhile ca k and na is naturally occurring elements in plant origin material could be removed as heavy metal substitution during adsorption process via ion exchange mechanism 32 33 these cationic elements also contributes to improve charge attraction properties of the coagulant not only for destabilizing the suspended particles but also effective in removing e coli which known to bears negative surface charges removal through electrochemical disinfection mechanism 34 35 3 1 2 ftir analysis the ftir spectra of alum native cps and mcps are presented in fig 4 the ftir spectrum of alum sample indicates that the compounds are hydrate as the broad absorption band observed between 3500 and 3200 cm 1 is due to hydroxide stretching vibration and the absorption band around 1620 cm 1 corresponds to oh bending vibration mode which confirmed the presence of molecular and free water respectively the peak at wavenumber of 1075 cm 1 could be attributed to the asymmetric stretching of free sulphate anion the identified bands for alum were similar to those findings reported in the literature 36 37 meanwhile in comparison with the spectrum for cps the molecular level changes of mcps resulted from the modification process were evidenced from the ftir analysis the ftir spectra confirmed the changes in the chemical groups of the starch which are defined by the band shift as well as the formation of minor and major peaks changes in the peak position could be attributed to the changes in counter ions associated with carboxylate and hydroxylate anions that mostly belong to carbonyl and hydroxyl groups residing in starch molecules 38 39 notable changes were seen in the broad band at 3400 3600 cm 1 which are probably due to complexation reaction involving the ionised oh group of free and bonded hydroxyl groups in carboxylic acids these groups are commonly found in polymeric compounds such as alcohols and phenols of carbohydrate polymers 31 since cps is principally composed of glucose monomers it is well demonstrated from the ftir spectrum that carboxyl and hydroxyl groups are present in abundant these groups available in biopolymers may function as proton donors hence deprotonated hydroxyl and carboxyl groups may be involved in the formation of alum starch complex 33 changes in the region between 2900 and 3000 cm 1 may indicate the ion exchange reaction driven by the proton substitution of symmetric or asymmetric ch bonds and the symmetric stretching vibration of ch2 belongs to aliphatic acids meanwhile the peaks appeared between 1750 and 1680 cm 1 demonstrated the stretching vibration of co bonds due to non ionic carboxyl groups cooh cooch3 and also hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acids and ester groups 40 peak changes were also observed between the wavenumber of 1400 and 1200 cm 1 which reflect the stretching vibration of symmetrical or asymmetrical ionic carboxylic groups cooh of starch and may indicate that the ion exchange process had taken place 7 this phenomenon can be related to the observation obtained from edx analysis where several elements such as na cl k and ca were newly added in the mcps sample and might be integrated in the starch framework through ion exchange mechanism moreover distinctive changes were also noted at 1016 cm 1 where the intensity of the peak of mcps increased significantly thus forming a deep peak several studies relate the bands in the area between 1016 and 600 cm 1 with the characteristics of co stretching of terpene components which probably come from active components of lemongrass such as citral geraniol and linalool 41 42 3 1 3 1h nmr analysis chemical composition parameters of the starches were further measured by 1h nmr technique and the spectra are presented in fig 5 a significant rise of new peaks was observed in mcps sample due to chemical substitution involving anomeric protons in α 1 4 and α 1 6 glycosidic linkages with plant secondary metabolites 43 the modified starch revealed new peaks at 1 09 and 1 20 ppm which are reflected to ch3 in an alcohol group 44 meanwhile the intense peak appeared at 1 78 ppm is related to lemongrass active groups including neral and geranial which are the isomers of citral 3 7 dimethyl 2 6 octadienal 44 signals indicating carbohydrate monomers including α glucose and β glucose were also observed as broad peaks at 3 4 ppm for mcps sample 44 the observation based on nmr signals has proven the successful perfusion of lemongrass extract active compounds into the native starch 3 2 coagulation performance of dual coagulants 3 2 1 effect of ph as presented in fig 6 when alum was tested as a sole coagulant the coagulant demonstrated the highest tss removal percentage 80 30 at the preferred ph value of 7 the results also revealed that coagulation process using alum as the sole coagulant reflect a wide effective ph range where the variations of coagulant performance to remove tss between ph 6 and 9 are not significantly different p 0 05 these observations are sufficiently in accordance with other similar studies using alum as the primary coagulant 45 46 many researchers stipulate that alum solubility depends on ph and the most optimum values are between ph 5 and 9 beyond this range coagulation activity using alum salts are retarded 47 duan gregory 48 suggested that sweep flocculation mechanism generally gives better particle removal compared to destabilisation by just charge neutralisation therefore the relatively low concentration of aluminium hydroxide precipitates at ph lower than the optimum resulted in lower removal of suspended solids the decrease of tss removal was also recognised at ph higher than the optimum due to the predominant existence of negatively charged monomeric hydroxoaluminium anions such as al oh 4 49 the dual coagulants appeared to show better removal of tss in extreme acidic ph range and started to decrease with increasing ph values the coagulation performance started to improve further when entering the neutral region remarkable rise in tss removal 88 41 was achieved at the optimum ph 7 meanwhile the combination of alum cps indicated appreciable maximum tss removal of 77 78 at similar ph similar observation was reported by razali ariffin 50 and yeap et al 51 the research reported that good flocculation performance was observed below ph 7 according to cañizares et al 52 and teh et al 4 at optimum ph when alum was used in combination with starch coagulants hydroxoaluminium cations monomeric and polymeric coexisted with aluminium hydroxide precipitates the monomeric metal cations may possibly neutralise the negative charge of pollutants through surface adsorption whereas polymeric metal cations promote binding between pollutant particles suspended solids could also be enmeshed into the growing aluminium hydroxide precipitates via adsorption to be effectively separated progressively through sedimentation appreciable performance of the dual coagulants at extremely acidic ph condition could be due to the concentration of proton increases with the introduction of acid into the suspension the protons may assist to reduce the repulsive forces between colloidal particles thus facilitating destabilization of particles 50 natural materials including starch are abundant with anionic active components that could act as the reservoir of alkalinity and facilitate the neutralisation of the acid produced by the hydrolysis of aluminium ion 53 divalent cations suspended in a water medium could be bound to anionic active sites available on the surface of biomass subsequently a mesh like structure that entrapped colloidal particles are formed which later separate the particles from water through the action of sweep flocculation 54 the performance of all coagulants in the removal of e coli under varying ph is also demonstrated in fig 6 the removal efficiencies of all coagulants except for alum mcps combination demonstrated a u shaped pattern with higher e coli removal at the acidic range ph 2 4 and started to alleviate when the ph approached the neutral range higher removal was also detected when the ph values increased towards alkaline regions based on the observations charge attraction would be one of the main mechanisms controlling the flocculation of e coli at acidic condition the surface of coagulants would bear positive charges where tertiary amine groups of the starch may have attracted and interacted with the bacterial surface according to zahrim et al 55 in the acidic environment high concentration of protons contributed to the abundance of positive in the medium which this species offering a completion to attract negatively and neutral species in water resulting to particles tending to self aggregate increasing ph would change the net charge of coagulant surface to be less negative thus reducing the charge attraction between e coli surface and coagulant species 7 3 2 2 effect of varying ratio of alum starch dosage since alum demonstrated better efficiency under natural ph therefore the optimisation study using a combination of alum cps and alum mcps as dual coagulants was conducted under the previously optimised working conditions of alum as the primary coagulant the results presented in fig 7 indicate that the removal of tss was further enhanced when alum was used in combination with the starches with the maximum tss removal of 91 30 and 88 89 were recorded for alum mcps and alum cps respectively at dosage of 7 5 50 mg l lower dosage of alum 7 5 mg l was sufficient to remove up to 90 of tss when the treatment was supplemented with mcps 50 mg l which could be that at an optimised dosage electrokinetic potential of the colloidal medium is reduced by alum through charge neutralisation this situation may facilitate the bridging flocculation process played by the modified starch due to the lower repulsion forces between anionic species of the starch and colloidal particles 56 according to abiola 57 the interaction established between cationic charge of al3 and anionic charge of starch molecules produces insoluble aluminium salts the insoluble salts are expected to initiate the formation of microflocs at the initial stage which in the later stage it gradually develops into larger flocs and finally settled moreover the enhanced tss removal could also be linked to the findings reported by 58 comparable to starch maerua subcordata plant extract indicated very high content of amylopectin the study deduced that amylopectin could be the chief agent in enhancing water clarity through formation of bridges between the particles consequently increasing the colloidal mass and leading to precipitation tirado et al 59 suggested that the polar nature of starch allows its dispersion in an aqueous media but to achieve complete dissolution it requires the addition of an alkali compound or heat treatment moreover the modification of starch with ethanol extract of lemongrass could increase its solubility in an aqueous media due to the introduction of hydrophilic groups in the starch structure which further increase the number of hydrogen bridges with the surrounding water molecules 60 as presented in fig 7 the introduction of mcps into the system effectively disinfected the water samples from e coli 100 removal even at the minimum amount of mcps of 25 mg l p 0 05 these findings showed the dual coagulant of alum mcps exhibited dual properties of flocculation and disinfecting effect as confirmed by the coagulant characterisation using ftir and 1h nmr the active groups of terpene compounds including citral attached to mcps after modification process using lemongrass extract have added the antimicrobial behaviour of mcps it could also be deduced that in the earlier stage the anionic bacterial cell wall could be attracted towards cationic alum complex through electrostatic interaction which enmeshed the bacteria within the microflocs formed by alum coagulation in the later stage it was qualitatively inferred that the release of aromatic metabolites such as citral compound from mcps into the medium that caused the rupture of peptidoglycan layer of e coli cell wall could also be considered as a contributing factor towards high removal of e coli as observed by huang et al 7 3 2 3 effect of settling time effect of settling time was analysed at different sedimentation time at optimum ph and dosage of all coagulants from the results presented in fig 8 the increasing settling period from 10 to 60 min significantly enhanced the removal of tss from 60 87 to 84 06 for alum alone in the case of alum cps and alum mcps significantly shorter settling time 10 min was needed to achieve high tss removal 89 86 and 92 75 respectively within the same settling period 10 min e coli removal was recorded at 100 58 22 and 71 57 for alum mcps alum alone and alum cps respectively the observation was in agreement with the findings reported by teh et al 4 the study suggested that flocs associated with rice starch coagulant are able to settle faster and more easily due to higher formation of aggregates of sufficient size the high settling velocity obtained for the treatment using alum coupled with the starches especially for alum mcps is also could be due to long structure of starch constituents with attachment of plant metabolites from lemongrass extract which contribute to its high molecular weight this distinguished property allows alum mcps complex to collide and interact with more colloidal particles at the same time which leads to the formation of bigger and denser flocs that can settle within shorter period 4 3 3 flocculation mechanisms evaluation of floc characteristics provides a better understanding of the possible coagulation mechanism using cps mcps and their reaction when used together with alum alum flocs as seen in fig 9 exhibited rough and irregular surface due to the aggregation of pollutants in the water as observed by teh et al 4 according to ni et al 61 the irregular morphology was also attributed by the aluminium crystal present in the flocs figs 10 and 11 show that the formation of flocs using cps and mcps in combination of alum consists of the combination morphology of irregular surface and fibrous like character as observed by shak wu 62 and subramonian et al 63 this phenomenon suggests the possibility that adsorption with inter particle bridging and sweep mechanism could be involved when cps and mcps were introduced into the suspension with alum as dual coagulants 4 sweep coagulation occurs through the precipitation of metal hydroxide and the colloidal particles are enmeshed in these precipitates sweep coagulation could result in improved coagulation for greater removal performance in comparison with charge neutralisation 48 the presence of e coli embedded within alum mcps flocs supports the potential of antimicrobial ability of the coagulants 7 meanwhile the ftir spectra of the flocs are shown in fig 12 broad and strong peaks at 3500 cm 1 represented oh groups these observations could also be related to water in the samples even though the floc samples were air dried prior to the analysis the adsorption peaks might also indicate the presence of trapped water inside the flocs 23 small peaks at 2900 cm 1 indicated stretching of ch bonds of aliphatic acids alum mcps flocs showed the strongest peak at this region this could be due to the reason that the region between 2960 and 2950 cm 1 was also noted where some cell wall constituents were usually found in e coli such as lipids lipoproteins and polysaccharides 63 the peaks at 1600 cm 1 were due to the stretching of co bonds of carboxyl groups moreover singh et al 64 suggested that the peaks around 1600 cm 1 were assigned to the formation of interaction between aluminium composite and suspended particles after bridging the broad peak at 1200 cm 1 was attributed to aliphatic amines the deeper peak observed at 1000 cm 1 of alum mcps flocs might belong to carbonyl group in cell wall related to glycopeptides as well as po stretching and poc bonds found in phospholipids and esters 63 these findings verified the binding of suspended particles including e coli cells into alum mcps floc agglomerates the findings from coagulant characterisation and optimisation studies in section 3 2 show that the dual coagulant of alum mcps exhibited dual properties of flocculation and disinfecting effect the aromatic ring belongs to citral attached to mcps after modification process using lemongrass extract adds the antimicrobial behaviour of mcps it is presumed that in the earlier stage the anionic bacterial cell wall could be attracted towards cationic alum complex through electrostatic interaction which enmeshed the bacteria within the microflocs formed by alum coagulation in the later stage it was qualitatively inferred that the release of aromatic metabolites such as citral compound from mcps into the medium that ruptured the peptidoglycan layer of e coli cell wall could also be considered as contributing factors towards high removal of e coli similar effects were reported by chen et al 65 and yang et al 35 where the dissociation of aromatic proteins from modified starch into e coli kaolin suspension resulted in the disruption of e coli cells meanwhile as expected the attraction of suspended solids by alum is confirmed to be driven by charge neutralisation mechanism based on the zeta potential values presented in fig 13 when alum was used as the sole coagulant at 15 mg l the zeta potential value was close to zero when dual coagulants were applied where alum dosage was reduced while cps mcps dosage was increased in the interval of 25 the zeta potential decreased and did not coincide with the increasing turbidity removal it could be confirmed from this phenomenon that the coagulation process in the system is not only governed by a single action of charge neutralisation but could also involve other mechanisms including bridging and sweep coagulation as presented in fig 14 the initial effect of charge neutralisation by an early addition of alum prior to introduction of cps mcps gives the advantage of reducing electrical repulsive forces between the suspended particles when alum was primarily added it tended to form microflocs with cationic patches this condition occurs because the suspended particles have fairly weak anionic surface charge 4 37 mv which resulted in some binding sites are left in positive charge the positive patches of particle surface play the role as anchor points for binding with high molecular weight anionic polyelectrolytes 56 66 the addition of highly branched starch polymer encourages bridging mechanism to take place the microflocs with cationic patches are then attracted to bind on the anionic backbone of one starch polymer and dynamically attached to another polymer to form three dimensional macroflocs until the system reaches an equilibrium point 4 conclusion a modified starch flocculant using natural precursors was successfully produced by a simple method the use of alum mcps as dual coagulants indicated that the combination not only exhibited superior flocculation potential 92 75 of tss removal in 10 min but was also very effective in removing bacteria from water 100 removal of e coli the flocculation and disinfecting effect are mainly dependent on the combined action of alum and active components attached at mcps backbone which results in the inhibition and enmeshment of bacterial cells in the floc matrix that further enhanced removal of tss and bacteria therefore owing to the favourable dual functionality of the coagulants combination it is expected that the required dosage of chemical coagulants and disinfectants in a water treatment plant could be reduced which in turn lowers operational cost and gives an impact on significant attenuation in the secondary pollution risk of chemical coagulants and disinfectant by products acknowledgements this work was funded by the fundamental research grant scheme frgs vot no

14369,the present study examined the synergistic effect of alum modified cassava peel starch as dual coagulants in removing total suspended solids and escherichia coli in dam water the optimisation study was carried out to evaluate the effects of ph coagulant dosage and settling time on the flocculation performance of the coagulants alum as sole coagulant and combination of alum and native cassava peel starch were also studied for comparison purpose characterisations of the coagulants using scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies confirmed the successful modification of cassava peel starch characterization studies revealed changes in surface morphology elemental distribution after the modification pores rough surfaces and several new element including cl and ca were observed on the surface of the modified starch the presence of important active groups such as citral that responsible for antimicrobial and flocculation function was also reflected in the modified starch coagulant the optimisation study indicated distinct performance of alum modified cassava peel starch compared to alum alone and alum cassava peel starch in terms of both flocculation and antibacterial functionality high removal of both tss and e coli was achieved with the treatment using the combination of alum modified cassava peel starch with superior removal of 92 75 and 100 respectively within 10 min of settling time using the recommended working conditions of alum modified cassava peel starch dosage of 7 5 50 mg l at ph 7 additionally the characterisation of flocs indicated that the employment of alum as sole coagulant and alum combined with the modified starch possessed distinctive features scanning electron micrograph showed that the flocs formed using alum modified cassava peel starch was highly compacted clusters with appearance of e coli cells embedded in the floc matrix whereas for alum as the sole coagulant the flocs were irregular shaped and aggregated besides the difference in peak occurrence from analysis reflected different mechanisms of floc formation using alum alone and alum modified cassava peel starch from the floc analysis study charge neutralisation bridging and sweep flocculation were the mechanisms that are expected to govern the coagulation and flocculation process keywords coagulation flocculation natural coagulant cassava peel starch modified starch charge neutralisation 1 introduction water is an integral part of the environment that is needed by all organisms to maintain their survival water is a vital element for socioeconomic development and equally important to preserve environmental sustainability malaysia is a fortunate country located immediately on the north of the equator that has a tropical rainforest climate therefore this nation is privileged to be humid and rainy throughout the year 1 water resources in malaysia are considered as abundantly available nonetheless the resources are becoming very limited in its pure state due to massive urbanisation and increasing population growth the quality of surface water is usually influenced by external inputs approaching into the reservoir from the water shed as well as from nutrient cycling and internal loading the external inputs discharged from point and non point sources can be in the form of organic and inorganic pollutants and nutrients 2 among various contaminants intruded into surface water suspended solids and bacteria such as escherichia coli are mostly common suspended solids that are commonly present in the water body due to natural occurrence can also be contributed by earthworks and land clearing activities these colloidal particles include organic materials such as algae and inorganic materials such as silt and sediment meanwhile the potential sources of bacterial contamination vary but usually come from grazing livestock poultry waste as well as untreated waste discharge from nearby residential settlements 3 consequently interventions in water treatment sanitation and hygiene are crucial to ensure water impurities can be removed efficiently prior to discharge into receiving bodies conventional surface water treatment plants have an equitable standard sequence of processes and the most important stage is coagulation and flocculation processes 4 the significance of coagulation process lies on its ability to settle very fine colloidal particles that are generally unable to settle under natural gravity condition cationic salts such as aluminium chloride aluminium sulfate ferric chloride ferric sulfate as well as polyaluminium chloride are typically used as the primary coagulants in many developed countries although the coagulation efficiency of using these chemical coagulants is well proven their efficiency in removing bacteria is not well documented most microorganisms in surface water are usually controlled by the addition of disinfectants at the later stage after coagulation however in recent years since water quality has seriously deteriorated due to intense anthropogenic activities larger dosage of coagulants and disinfectants are required in treating water to comply with national drinking water standards 5 this situation implicates not only towards elevating treatment expenses but also possibly triggers greater risk of secondary pollution with adverse consequences on human health such as disinfection of by products produced during chlorine disinfection 6 7 additionally excessive dosage of chemical coagulant increased the amount of residual metals and potentially released noxious polymeric monomers in treated water 7 8 in line with emerging awareness on the health effect carried by chemical coagulants intense focus has been given towards natural polymer based coagulants partial substitution of chemical coagulants with natural polymer based coagulants would certainly decrease aluminium residue in treated water however according to niquette et al 9 modification of coagulation conditions due to coagulant replacement may impair pathogen breakout in drinking water controlling possible consequences caused by microbial contamination is of extreme importance and must never be compromised 10 therefore a dual function agent for water treatment with high flocculation efficiency and antibacterial properties is needed to produce safe drinking water in all raw water conditions the continuous search for potential antimicrobial agents with coagulation ability has led to the identification of antimicrobial biomaterials based on polymers or their composites in recent years the modification of starch polymer has been explored as a way of combining their best attributes with those of synthetic polymers various modification techniques including oxidisation graft copolymerisation and etherification techniques allow one to chemically change starch polymer by introducing functional groups which leads to new starch products with dual properties flocculating and antibacterial abilities 11 unfortunately the use of acrylamide dimethylamine and epichlorohydrin as the common grafting monomers in the modification techniques has limit their application in some countries through legal restrictions due to their toxicity and carcinogenic effects 12 in many years the antibacterial property found in the extract of lemongrass has been elucidated from various researches with promising results 13 15 α citral geranial and β citral neral are among the major bioactive compounds that contribute to the antimicrobial activity of the extracts these components possess the ability to inhibit the growth of both gram positive and gram negative bacteria 14 however to the best of our knowledge there is no literature describing the potential of incorporating lemongrass extract in cassava peel starch cps to remove total suspended solids tss and e coli in raw water cassava peel waste is available in abundance at no cost from local small industries and it is a renewable precursor therefore in the present study a new flocculant was synthesised using starch isolated from cassava peel waste followed by modification using lemongrass extract to produce a modified coagulant to be used in combination with alum in order to enhance the removal of tss and e coli in raw water 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection of dam water dam water was collected from an intake tank of sembrong barat water treatment plant johor malaysia the physicochemical characteristics of the dam water are shown in table 1 2 2 isolation of starch cassava peels were obtained from local food industries around parit raja johor malaysia initially 100 g of selected peels were washed and the periderm layers were peeled off then the peels were diced into smaller pieces and homogenised in 200 ml of distilled water using a blender 16 17 after that 2 l of distilled water was added to the suspension and stirred for 2 min the slurry was then filtered through muslin cloth and the filtrate was left to sediment for 2 h subsequently the supernatant was discarded and the starch sediment was collected the isolated starch was subjected to sun drying for at least 24 h until it reached a constant weight dried cps was kept in an airtight container for further experimental use 2 3 isolation of lemongrass extract lemongrass stalks were purchased from local markets around parit raja johor malaysia 500 g of lemongrass stalks were fragmented into pieces of 10 mm length and dried in an oven at 60 c for 72 h to remove moisture content the dried samples were then crushed using a domestic blender to

distilled off at 65 c using a rotary evaporator the final extracts were stored in airtight amber glass bottles at 4 c for further analysis 20 21 2 4 synthesis of modified cassava peel starch the synthesis of modified cassava peel starch mcps was performed by adopting starch treatment method from palacios fonseca et al 22 with a slight adaptation by incorporating lemongrass extract as the modification monomer 25 g of native cps was suspended in 100 ml of 100 lemongrass extract the suspension was stirred at 150 rpm for 1 h at 25 c followed by the addition of 1 ml of concentrated 36 by weight hydrochloric acid hcl the reaction was allowed to proceed at 25 c for 24 h with continuous stirring at 150 rpm the reaction was terminated by adding 14 ml of 1 m sodium bicarbonate nahco3 into the mixture the suspension was cooled in an ice bath for 5 min starch precipitate was separated from the liquid residue by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min subsequently the supernatant was removed and starch pellet was sun dried until it reached a constant weight the modified starch was finally stored as solid powders to achieve long term shelf stability 2 5 starch characterisation the morphology and elemental distribution of native cps and mcps were analysed using scanning electron microscopy electron dispersive x ray spectrometry sem edx jeol jsm japan the infrared spectra of native cps and mcps were recorded with a fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer perkin elmer spectrum 100 usa the spectra were recorded in the wavenumber range from 400 to 4000 cm 1 the structure of the compounds in both starches was determined using 1h nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 1h nmr bruker avance model drx 500 germany using heavy water d2o as solvent and the range of chemical shift was measured between 0 and 10 ppm 2 6 preparation of stock solutions 1 g of cps mcps powder was suspended in 1 l of distilled water to produce cps mcps stock solution of 1 g l a uniform mixture was attained by continuous stirring of the suspension for 1 h at room temperature 4 5 g of analytical grade aluminium sulphate al2 so4 3 18h2o merck was employed in this study to prepare alum stock solution the metal salt was dissolved in 1 l of distilled water and then further diluted with distilled water to achieve the intended concentrations 2 7 coagulation and flocculation studies a standard flocculator equipped with 6 paddles velp italy was employed in this study all 6 beakers were filled with 1 l of water samples the ph of water samples was measured using a portable ph meter eutech ph adjustment was done using 0 1 m hcl merck and 0 1 m sodium hydroxide naoh merck an optimisation study was performed under three sets of experimental conditions i alum as a sole coagulant ii a combination of alum cps and iii a combination of alum mcps as dual coagulants when the dual coagulant mode was used cps mcps was added 30 s after alum was added 23 all parameters subjected for the optimisation study and the working range used are summarised in table 2 for each jar test performed a rapid stirring period was set for 1 min at 200 rpm followed by 2 min at 100 rpm subsequently a slow stirring period was conducted for 30 min at reduced speed of 25 rpm upon completion of settling time water samples were collected at 2 cm below the surface level tss measurement of the treated water was done using a hach dr 6000 spectrophotometer by adopting photometric method each experimental run was repeated in three replicates n 3 the coagulation efficiency of each experimental run was represented by tss removal as shown in the following equation 1 tss removal ts s i ts s f ts s i 100 where tssi and tssf are the initial and final tss values mg l respectively in all jar test performed sub samples were also taken for final e coli count the samples were diluted in sterile 0 1 peptone water to 101 102 and 103 1 ml of the diluted samples was cultured on each chromocult agar plate 24 25 precipitated flocs were harvested and subjected to ftir spectroscopy for chemical functional group analysis and sem edx for surface morphology and elemental distribution analysis 2 8 floc analysis samples of the coagulant flocs were analysed using special instrumentation sem edx spectrophotometry was used to analyse the morphology of flocs whereas the infrared spectra of flocs were analysed using an ftir spectrometer perkin elmer spectrum 100 usa from 400 to 4000 cm 1 2 9 statistical analysis all data were subjected to analysis of variance anova a p value lower than 0 05 indicates that the data are considered to be statistically significant 3 results discussion 3 1 starch characterisation 3 1 1 sem edx analysis the surface morphology and edx spectrum of alum are presented in fig 1 as can be seen solid particles formed agglomerates made of crystals from different sizes the average size of alum agglomerates was around 40 60 μm similar to the observation reported by 26 surface elemental distribution reflected by edx spectrometry confirmed the absence of any impurity in the alum sample used as primary coagulant in the present study morphology and surface elemental distribution of native and mcps are presented in figs 2 and 3 respectively both starches indicated polygonal and spherical starch granules with clearly defined ridges that appeared to mark sites where granules were in close contact with one another 27 28 moreover starch granules of native cps were observed to be smoother with no evidence of cracks due to low level damage during starch isolation process 29 the edx analysis done on the native cps only identified the presence of prominent c and o peaks which confirmed the supposition that the starch granules are purely made up of carbohydrate monomers meanwhile the microscopic analysis of mcps showed noticeable rough surface and wave like creases which might be due to penetration of hcl through channels and cavities of the starch granules during the modification process as observed by palacios fonseca et al 22 and van hung et al 30 however it was observed that the modification method did not severely affect the morphological characteristics of the starch granules where no depression cracks or hollow granules were observed apparently as observed in the edx spectrum of mcps presented in fig 3 significant percentages of new elements of na cl k and ca were detected the appearance of these elements in mcps indicated the occurrence of modification and proved that lemongrass extract and hcl were grafted onto cps the modification of starch using lemongrass extract had superimposed the surface elemental characteristic of mcps which indicated the increasing possibility of antibacterial property and metal binding ability in different parts of the coagulant increasing level of chlorine potentially increase bacteriacidal effect of the material as reported by maharjan et al 31 meanwhile ca k and na is naturally occurring elements in plant origin material could be removed as heavy metal substitution during adsorption process via ion exchange mechanism 32 33 these cationic elements also contributes to improve charge attraction properties of the coagulant not only for destabilizing the suspended particles but also effective in removing e coli which known to bears negative surface charges removal through electrochemical disinfection mechanism 34 35 3 1 2 ftir analysis the ftir spectra of alum native cps and mcps are presented in fig 4 the ftir spectrum of alum sample indicates that the compounds are hydrate as the broad absorption band observed between 3500 and 3200 cm 1 is due to hydroxide stretching vibration and the absorption band around 1620 cm 1 corresponds to oh bending vibration mode which confirmed the presence of molecular and free water respectively the peak at wavenumber of 1075 cm 1 could be attributed to the asymmetric stretching of free sulphate anion the identified bands for alum were similar to those findings reported in the literature 36 37 meanwhile in comparison with the spectrum for cps the molecular level changes of mcps resulted from the modification process were evidenced from the ftir analysis the ftir spectra confirmed the changes in the chemical groups of the starch which are defined by the band shift as well as the formation of minor and major peaks changes in the peak position could be attributed to the changes in counter ions associated with carboxylate and hydroxylate anions that mostly belong to carbonyl and hydroxyl groups residing in starch molecules 38 39 notable changes were seen in the broad band at 3400 3600 cm 1 which are probably due to complexation reaction involving the ionised oh group of free and bonded hydroxyl groups in carboxylic acids these groups are commonly found in polymeric compounds such as alcohols and phenols of carbohydrate polymers 31 since cps is principally composed of glucose monomers it is well demonstrated from the ftir spectrum that carboxyl and hydroxyl groups are present in abundant these groups available in biopolymers may function as proton donors hence deprotonated hydroxyl and carboxyl groups may be involved in the formation of alum starch complex 33 changes in the region between 2900 and 3000 cm 1 may indicate the ion exchange reaction driven by the proton substitution of symmetric or asymmetric ch bonds and the symmetric stretching vibration of ch2 belongs to aliphatic acids meanwhile the peaks appeared between 1750 and 1680 cm 1 demonstrated the stretching vibration of co bonds due to non ionic carboxyl groups cooh cooch3 and also hydrogen bonding between carboxylic acids and ester groups 40 peak changes were also observed between the wavenumber of 1400 and 1200 cm 1 which reflect the stretching vibration of symmetrical or asymmetrical ionic carboxylic groups cooh of starch and may indicate that the ion exchange process had taken place 7 this phenomenon can be related to the observation obtained from edx analysis where several elements such as na cl k and ca were newly added in the mcps sample and might be integrated in the starch framework through ion exchange mechanism moreover distinctive changes were also noted at 1016 cm 1 where the intensity of the peak of mcps increased significantly thus forming a deep peak several studies relate the bands in the area between 1016 and 600 cm 1 with the characteristics of co stretching of terpene components which probably come from active components of lemongrass such as citral geraniol and linalool 41 42 3 1 3 1h nmr analysis chemical composition parameters of the starches were further measured by 1h nmr technique and the spectra are presented in fig 5 a significant rise of new peaks was observed in mcps sample due to chemical substitution involving anomeric protons in α 1 4 and α 1 6 glycosidic linkages with plant secondary metabolites 43 the modified starch revealed new peaks at 1 09 and 1 20 ppm which are reflected to ch3 in an alcohol group 44 meanwhile the intense peak appeared at 1 78 ppm is related to lemongrass active groups including neral and geranial which are the isomers of citral 3 7 dimethyl 2 6 octadienal 44 signals indicating carbohydrate monomers including α glucose and β glucose were also observed as broad peaks at 3 4 ppm for mcps sample 44 the observation based on nmr signals has proven the successful perfusion of lemongrass extract active compounds into the native starch 3 2 coagulation performance of dual coagulants 3 2 1 effect of ph as presented in fig 6 when alum was tested as a sole coagulant the coagulant demonstrated the highest tss removal percentage 80 30 at the preferred ph value of 7 the results also revealed that coagulation process using alum as the sole coagulant reflect a wide effective ph range where the variations of coagulant performance to remove tss between ph 6 and 9 are not significantly different p 0 05 these observations are sufficiently in accordance with other similar studies using alum as the primary coagulant 45 46 many researchers stipulate that alum solubility depends on ph and the most optimum values are between ph 5 and 9 beyond this range coagulation activity using alum salts are retarded 47 duan gregory 48 suggested that sweep flocculation mechanism generally gives better particle removal compared to destabilisation by just charge neutralisation therefore the relatively low concentration of aluminium hydroxide precipitates at ph lower than the optimum resulted in lower removal of suspended solids the decrease of tss removal was also recognised at ph higher than the optimum due to the predominant existence of negatively charged monomeric hydroxoaluminium anions such as al oh 4 49 the dual coagulants appeared to show better removal of tss in extreme acidic ph range and started to decrease with increasing ph values the coagulation performance started to improve further when entering the neutral region remarkable rise in tss removal 88 41 was achieved at the optimum ph 7 meanwhile the combination of alum cps indicated appreciable maximum tss removal of 77 78 at similar ph similar observation was reported by razali ariffin 50 and yeap et al 51 the research reported that good flocculation performance was observed below ph 7 according to cañizares et al 52 and teh et al 4 at optimum ph when alum was used in combination with starch coagulants hydroxoaluminium cations monomeric and polymeric coexisted with aluminium hydroxide precipitates the monomeric metal cations may possibly neutralise the negative charge of pollutants through surface adsorption whereas polymeric metal cations promote binding between pollutant particles suspended solids could also be enmeshed into the growing aluminium hydroxide precipitates via adsorption to be effectively separated progressively through sedimentation appreciable performance of the dual coagulants at extremely acidic ph condition could be due to the concentration of proton increases with the introduction of acid into the suspension the protons may assist to reduce the repulsive forces between colloidal particles thus facilitating destabilization of particles 50 natural materials including starch are abundant with anionic active components that could act as the reservoir of alkalinity and facilitate the neutralisation of the acid produced by the hydrolysis of aluminium ion 53 divalent cations suspended in a water medium could be bound to anionic active sites available on the surface of biomass subsequently a mesh like structure that entrapped colloidal particles are formed which later separate the particles from water through the action of sweep flocculation 54 the performance of all coagulants in the removal of e coli under varying ph is also demonstrated in fig 6 the removal efficiencies of all coagulants except for alum mcps combination demonstrated a u shaped pattern with higher e coli removal at the acidic range ph 2 4 and started to alleviate when the ph approached the neutral range higher removal was also detected when the ph values increased towards alkaline regions based on the observations charge attraction would be one of the main mechanisms controlling the flocculation of e coli at acidic condition the surface of coagulants would bear positive charges where tertiary amine groups of the starch may have attracted and interacted with the bacterial surface according to zahrim et al 55 in the acidic environment high concentration of protons contributed to the abundance of positive in the medium which this species offering a completion to attract negatively and neutral species in water resulting to particles tending to self aggregate increasing ph would change the net charge of coagulant surface to be less negative thus reducing the charge attraction between e coli surface and coagulant species 7 3 2 2 effect of varying ratio of alum starch dosage since alum demonstrated better efficiency under natural ph therefore the optimisation study using a combination of alum cps and alum mcps as dual coagulants was conducted under the previously optimised working conditions of alum as the primary coagulant the results presented in fig 7 indicate that the removal of tss was further enhanced when alum was used in combination with the starches with the maximum tss removal of 91 30 and 88 89 were recorded for alum mcps and alum cps respectively at dosage of 7 5 50 mg l lower dosage of alum 7 5 mg l was sufficient to remove up to 90 of tss when the treatment was supplemented with mcps 50 mg l which could be that at an optimised dosage electrokinetic potential of the colloidal medium is reduced by alum through charge neutralisation this situation may facilitate the bridging flocculation process played by the modified starch due to the lower repulsion forces between anionic species of the starch and colloidal particles 56 according to abiola 57 the interaction established between cationic charge of al3 and anionic charge of starch molecules produces insoluble aluminium salts the insoluble salts are expected to initiate the formation of microflocs at the initial stage which in the later stage it gradually develops into larger flocs and finally settled moreover the enhanced tss removal could also be linked to the findings reported by 58 comparable to starch maerua subcordata plant extract indicated very high content of amylopectin the study deduced that amylopectin could be the chief agent in enhancing water clarity through formation of bridges between the particles consequently increasing the colloidal mass and leading to precipitation tirado et al 59 suggested that the polar nature of starch allows its dispersion in an aqueous media but to achieve complete dissolution it requires the addition of an alkali compound or heat treatment moreover the modification of starch with ethanol extract of lemongrass could increase its solubility in an aqueous media due to the introduction of hydrophilic groups in the starch structure which further increase the number of hydrogen bridges with the surrounding water molecules 60 as presented in fig 7 the introduction of mcps into the system effectively disinfected the water samples from e coli 100 removal even at the minimum amount of mcps of 25 mg l p 0 05 these findings showed the dual coagulant of alum mcps exhibited dual properties of flocculation and disinfecting effect as confirmed by the coagulant characterisation using ftir and 1h nmr the active groups of terpene compounds including citral attached to mcps after modification process using lemongrass extract have added the antimicrobial behaviour of mcps it could also be deduced that in the earlier stage the anionic bacterial cell wall could be attracted towards cationic alum complex through electrostatic interaction which enmeshed the bacteria within the microflocs formed by alum coagulation in the later stage it was qualitatively inferred that the release of aromatic metabolites such as citral compound from mcps into the medium that caused the rupture of peptidoglycan layer of e coli cell wall could also be considered as a contributing factor towards high removal of e coli as observed by huang et al 7 3 2 3 effect of settling time effect of settling time was analysed at different sedimentation time at optimum ph and dosage of all coagulants from the results presented in fig 8 the increasing settling period from 10 to 60 min significantly enhanced the removal of tss from 60 87 to 84 06 for alum alone in the case of alum cps and alum mcps significantly shorter settling time 10 min was needed to achieve high tss removal 89 86 and 92 75 respectively within the same settling period 10 min e coli removal was recorded at 100 58 22 and 71 57 for alum mcps alum alone and alum cps respectively the observation was in agreement with the findings reported by teh et al 4 the study suggested that flocs associated with rice starch coagulant are able to settle faster and more easily due to higher formation of aggregates of sufficient size the high settling velocity obtained for the treatment using alum coupled with the starches especially for alum mcps is also could be due to long structure of starch constituents with attachment of plant metabolites from lemongrass extract which contribute to its high molecular weight this distinguished property allows alum mcps complex to collide and interact with more colloidal particles at the same time which leads to the formation of bigger and denser flocs that can settle within shorter period 4 3 3 flocculation mechanisms evaluation of floc characteristics provides a better understanding of the possible coagulation mechanism using cps mcps and their reaction when used together with alum alum flocs as seen in fig 9 exhibited rough and irregular surface due to the aggregation of pollutants in the water as observed by teh et al 4 according to ni et al 61 the irregular morphology was also attributed by the aluminium crystal present in the flocs figs 10 and 11 show that the formation of flocs using cps and mcps in combination of alum consists of the combination morphology of irregular surface and fibrous like character as observed by shak wu 62 and subramonian et al 63 this phenomenon suggests the possibility that adsorption with inter particle bridging and sweep mechanism could be involved when cps and mcps were introduced into the suspension with alum as dual coagulants 4 sweep coagulation occurs through the precipitation of metal hydroxide and the colloidal particles are enmeshed in these precipitates sweep coagulation could result in improved coagulation for greater removal performance in comparison with charge neutralisation 48 the presence of e coli embedded within alum mcps flocs supports the potential of antimicrobial ability of the coagulants 7 meanwhile the ftir spectra of the flocs are shown in fig 12 broad and strong peaks at 3500 cm 1 represented oh groups these observations could also be related to water in the samples even though the floc samples were air dried prior to the analysis the adsorption peaks might also indicate the presence of trapped water inside the flocs 23 small peaks at 2900 cm 1 indicated stretching of ch bonds of aliphatic acids alum mcps flocs showed the strongest peak at this region this could be due to the reason that the region between 2960 and 2950 cm 1 was also noted where some cell wall constituents were usually found in e coli such as lipids lipoproteins and polysaccharides 63 the peaks at 1600 cm 1 were due to the stretching of co bonds of carboxyl groups moreover singh et al 64 suggested that the peaks around 1600 cm 1 were assigned to the formation of interaction between aluminium composite and suspended particles after bridging the broad peak at 1200 cm 1 was attributed to aliphatic amines the deeper peak observed at 1000 cm 1 of alum mcps flocs might belong to carbonyl group in cell wall related to glycopeptides as well as po stretching and poc bonds found in phospholipids and esters 63 these findings verified the binding of suspended particles including e coli cells into alum mcps floc agglomerates the findings from coagulant characterisation and optimisation studies in section 3 2 show that the dual coagulant of alum mcps exhibited dual properties of flocculation and disinfecting effect the aromatic ring belongs to citral attached to mcps after modification process using lemongrass extract adds the antimicrobial behaviour of mcps it is presumed that in the earlier stage the anionic bacterial cell wall could be attracted towards cationic alum complex through electrostatic interaction which enmeshed the bacteria within the microflocs formed by alum coagulation in the later stage it was qualitatively inferred that the release of aromatic metabolites such as citral compound from mcps into the medium that ruptured the peptidoglycan layer of e coli cell wall could also be considered as contributing factors towards high removal of e coli similar effects were reported by chen et al 65 and yang et al 35 where the dissociation of aromatic proteins from modified starch into e coli kaolin suspension resulted in the disruption of e coli cells meanwhile as expected the attraction of suspended solids by alum is confirmed to be driven by charge neutralisation mechanism based on the zeta potential values presented in fig 13 when alum was used as the sole coagulant at 15 mg l the zeta potential value was close to zero when dual coagulants were applied where alum dosage was reduced while cps mcps dosage was increased in the interval of 25 the zeta potential decreased and did not coincide with the increasing turbidity removal it could be confirmed from this phenomenon that the coagulation process in the system is not only governed by a single action of charge neutralisation but could also involve other mechanisms including bridging and sweep coagulation as presented in fig 14 the initial effect of charge neutralisation by an early addition of alum prior to introduction of cps mcps gives the advantage of reducing electrical repulsive forces between the suspended particles when alum was primarily added it tended to form microflocs with cationic patches this condition occurs because the suspended particles have fairly weak anionic surface charge 4 37 mv which resulted in some binding sites are left in positive charge the positive patches of particle surface play the role as anchor points for binding with high molecular weight anionic polyelectrolytes 56 66 the addition of highly branched starch polymer encourages bridging mechanism to take place the microflocs with cationic patches are then attracted to bind on the anionic backbone of one starch polymer and dynamically attached to another polymer to form three dimensional macroflocs until the system reaches an equilibrium point 4 conclusion a modified starch flocculant using natural precursors was successfully produced by a simple method the use of alum mcps as dual coagulants indicated that the combination not only exhibited superior flocculation potential 92 75 of tss removal in 10 min but was also very effective in removing bacteria from water 100 removal of e coli the flocculation and disinfecting effect are mainly dependent on the combined action of alum and active components attached at mcps backbone which results in the inhibition and enmeshment of bacterial cells in the floc matrix that further enhanced removal of tss and bacteria therefore owing to the favourable dual functionality of the coagulants combination it is expected that the required dosage of chemical coagulants and disinfectants in a water treatment plant could be reduced which in turn lowers operational cost and gives an impact on significant attenuation in the secondary pollution risk of chemical coagulants and disinfectant by products acknowledgements this work was funded by the fundamental research grant scheme frgs vot no
