18425,it has been long desired but challenging to forward the advanced treatment of wastewater from empirical trials towards scientific design due to the lack of molecular insight into the pollutants of concern herein we first established a systematic methodology to identify the ligands of ni ii complexes in an electroless nickel en plating effluent the presence of n containing groups in the ligands of most ni ii complexes was verified by time aligned icp ms and esi hrms implying the suitability of autocatalytic ozonation for efficient decomplexation thereby a combined process was proposed on the basis of ozonation to achieve over 83 decomplexation of ni ii initially at 0 36 mg l followed by selective ni ii sequestration for resource recovery combinational lc ms systems revealed the ozonation induced fragmentation or elimination of most ni ii complexes as well as the structural change of the residual complexed molecules the released free ni ii was further sequestrated by a nanocomposite of hydrated zr iv oxide confined in a polymeric cation exchanger nhzo pce the fixed bed working capacity of nhzo pce 550 bv for the ozonated en plating effluent was over 18 times that of the cation exchanger host 30 bv at the breakthrough point of 0 10 mg ni l more attractively five adsorption regeneration cycles demonstrated the great potential of the hybrid adsorbent for sustainable utilization this study is believed to shed new light on how to design rational processes for advanced treatment of real wastewater based on molecular identification graphical abstract image 1 keywords complexed heavy metals molecular identification mass spectrometry ozonation nanocomposite adsorption 1 introduction nickel plating plays an important part in the surface finishing industry by providing a great variety of industrial and daily products with glossy and preservative surfaces sudagar et al 2013 loto 2016 wherein electroless nickel en plating is the currently prevailing technique with widened surface applicability including insulators fujii et al 2014 shao et al 2014 li et al 2015 gao et al 2017 however en plating also produces a large amount of nickel containing wastewater such as the rinsing effluent ying et al 1988 almazan ruiz et al 2015 the discharge of ni is seriously controlled due to its high toxicity pane et al 2003 zambelli et al 2016 and carcinogenicity lee et al 1995 as the globally largest en plating market china has lowered the maximum contaminant level mcl of overall ni in plating effluent to 0 1 mg l in sensitive areas zhang et al 2013 2014 posing a harsh challenge for the advanced treatment of en plating wastewater in a typical scheme for the treatment of plating effluent a physicochemical unit followed by a biological treatment unit is empirically adopted to remove the heavy metals and the organics therein respectively wen et al 2018 conventional physicochemical treatment processes including precipitation adsorption and ion exchange could efficiently remove free nickel ions dizge et al 2009 fu and wang 2011 lee 2013 unfortunately the en plating effluent originally contains a wide variety of organic chelating agents shacham diamand et al 2015 which remarkably enhance the stability of ni via complexation lohan et al 2015 boiteau et al 2016 therefore additional units for advanced treatment of the recalcitrant ni organic complexes are commonly required to meet the stringent discharge standard advanced oxidation processes aops mainly fenton and ozonation have been widely employed as tertiary treatment to destroy the heavy metal complexes in wastewater stemmler et al 2001 durante et al 2010 2011 huang et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 compared with fenton process ozonation has become an attractive alternative mainly due to its fe sludge free merit sadrnourmohamadi and gorczyca 2015 which could considerably reduce the cost of hazardous waste disposal with growing molecular understanding of the structure activity relationships during ozonation buffle and von gunten 2006 noethe et al 2009 pablo pocostales et al 2010 it has been realized that the type of ligands would significantly affect the decomplexation efficiency for example ligands with amine groups such as edta favor an autocatalytic process to enhance the degradation efficiency via catalytic production of oh radical during ozonation huang et al 2016 hence a rational scheme of advanced treatment of en plating effluent can be scientifically designed with molecular insight into the ni complexes compared with the empirical trials based on traditional rough information such as total ni and chemical oxygen demand cod as far as we are concerned the lack of systematic methodology to identify the ligands of metal organic complexes in a real wastewater matrix is the primary obstacle to design a rational treatment scheme although many previous studies have reported the molecular changes of organic matter during water treatment processes cortes francisco et al 2014 michael kordatou et al 2015 the methodologies therein could not be directly applicable to ni complexes because the types of analyzed organic matter were not necessarily those complexing ni which actually dominated the behavior of the complexed metal recently boiteau et al 2016 implemented structural characterization of natural ni complexes via combinational mass spectrometry ms techniques however the superior complexity of the concerned secondary biological effluent of industrial wastewater over natural water definitely demands an upgraded methodology in this study we demonstrated a systematic methodology to identify the ligands of the ni ii complexes in a real en plating effluent mainly via time aligned inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms and electrospray ionization high resolution mass spectrometry esi hrms based on the molecular insights an advanced treatment scheme of ozonation decomplexation followed by nanocomposite adsorption was proposed the speciation change of the ni ii complexes before and after ozonation was particularly concerned and the decomplexed ni ii was further sequestered for resource recovery by selective adsorption with zr iv oxide nanocomposite we believe that this study will shed new light upon the molecular insight based rational design of advanced treatment of real wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and effluent sampling ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm was used for solution preparation and dilution cyanocobalamin tci shanghai methanesulfonic acid tci shanghai naoh acros thermo fisher scientific usa nickel chloride hexahydrate aladdin china methanol merck germany and ammonium acetate aladdin shanghai china were of chromatographic grade all other chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china unless stated otherwise polymeric cation exchanger pce and polymeric anion exchanger pae two types of commercial macroporous cation and anion exchangers 0 6 0 8 mm commercial names d001 and d201 respectively were kindly provided by jiangsu nju environmental technology co ltd the secondary effluent sample denoted as s1 was collected from a typical en plating plant in huizhou guangdong china which is located in one of the largest plating industrial parks in china all collected samples were filtered through cellulose membrane 0 45 μm and stored in the dark at 4 c until subsequent use 2 2 analysis 2 2 1 general analysis the ph and conductivity were measured using a portable multi parameter controller hq30d hach and total organic carbon toc was determined by a combustion type analyzer toc l shimadzu japan the total phosphorous and phosphate concentrations were determined by the molybdenum blue spectrophotometric method pan et al 2009 the concentrations of cl no3 and so4 2 were detected by an ion chromatography ic system ics 1100 dionex usa equipped with an anion column dionex ionpac as19 4 250 mm and a guard column dionex ionpac ag19 4 50 mm with 20 mmol l naoh as the eluent the total concentrations of ni ca k na mg were detected using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes icap 7400 thermo usa to differentiate the aqueous ni ii species by electrostatic charges the samples were subjected to spe through a na type cation exchange column cleanert ic na 1 ml agela to separate the cationic ni ii species 2 2 2 ic icp ms and sec icp ms analysis the combined ic icp ms or sec icp ms systems were employed to separate and identify the ni ii species wherein a six port valve is used to connect the hplc unit perkinelmer 200 to the icp ms unit nexion 300x perkinelmer cation ic cic anionic ic aic and size exclusion chromatography sec columns were respectively installed on the hplc apparatus to separate the ni ii species depending on different mechanisms the instrumentation parameters of both chromatographic systems are listed in table s1 2 2 3 ligand identification of ni ii complexes the organic species in the en plating effluent were concentrated by solid phase extraction spe as previously described method waska et al 2015 briefly the spe cartridges agilent bond elut ppl 1 0 g 6 ml were sequentially rinsed with 20 ml of pure methanol 10 ml of acidified ultrapure water ph 2 and 20 ml of ultrapure water 4 l of effluent samples with no ph adjustment passed through the ppl cartridges at flow rate of 5 ml min after extraction the cartridges were desalinated with 20 ml of ultrapure water and then eluted with 30 ml of absolute methanol the eluent was subjected to n2 purging at 50 c followed by dissolution in 10 ml and 5 ml of mixed methanol water solution 5 95 v v for the biochemical effluent sample and the ozonated sample respectively the eluted solution injection volume 50 μl was first analyzed on hplc icp ms to locate the ni ii complexes in the chromatogram in this case a c18 reversed phase column waters 4 6 150 mm 5 μm particle size was installed on the hplc icp ms system described above the organic species were separated over a linear gradient from 0 to 100 methanol during a period of 5 50 min followed by 10 min isocratic elution with methanol and another 30 min of isocratic elution with water at flow rate of 0 2 ml min the presence of methanol in the mobile phase might affect the sensitivity plasma temperature and stability of the icp ms analysis szpunar 2005 therefore oxygen was introduced into plasma to implement combustion of methanol as reported elsewhere lechtenfeld et al 2011 boiteau et al 2013 to obtain molecular insight into the ni ii complexes hplc esi hrms was performed on an integrated system of ultra performance liquid chromatograph uplc ultimate 3000 thermo connected with a hybrid quadrupole orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometer q exactive focus thermo equipped with a heated electrospray ionization source esi the chromatographic conditions were completely consistent with that of the hplc icp ms analysis and the following operating parameters were employed for ms analysis in negative ion mode resolution 35000 sheath gas flow rate 20 aux gas flow rate 5 spray voltage 3000 v capillary temperature 593 k although consistent chromatographic conditions were maintained in both hplc systems there might be a difference in retention time between different instruments to align their chromatograms cyanocobalamin was employed as an indicator to calibrate the retention time specifically the retention time of the m h peak m z 1353 560 was aligned with the corresponding 59co peak on the hplc icp ms chromatogram by applying a constant time offset an isotope pattern search algorithm was applied to detect the ni ii complexes by identifying m z and the valid isotopic abundance ratio which is in line with the natural abundance ratio 58ni 60ni 2 6 and mass differences between 58ni and 60ni within a mass tolerance of 0 006 m z meanwhile the retention time difference between the corresponding hplc icp ms peak was within 0 3 min 2 3 advanced treatment 2 3 1 process design the running effluent treatment scheme in the plant for ni removal was consisted of physicochemical treatment biochemical treatment fenton and biological aerated filter baf to meet the stringent discharge standard of ni the overdosed fe in the fenton unit brought about large amount of sludge which considerably elevated the operating cost due to the unsatisfactory efficiency of ni removal by the current treatment process alternative advanced oxidation technologies to replace fenton were in great demand wang et al 2019 among which ozonation was considered a promising option more importantly ozonation may outperform fenton in heavy metal decomplexation efficiency due to autocatalytic effect from the amine n bearing ligands huang et al 2016 for example our preliminary experiment showed that ni edta at identical ni concentration to the en plating effluent was much more efficiently decomplexed by ozonation than ni citrate while the efficiency order was reversed in fenton process fig 1 in this case the edta ligand were supposed to enhance the generation of oh radicals during ozonation due to the presence of amine n thus the molecular insights into the ligands of the ni complexes are of fundamental significance for the rational design of efficient advanced treatment of the en plating effluent in this study based on the ligand identification analysis of the en plating effluent which would be elucidated in the subsequent section ozonation was selected as the decomplexation technique due to the confirmed presence of n bearing groups in the ligands of ni complexes subsequently the ozonated effluent was subjected to selective ni ii adsorption by a millimeter sized nanocomposite in order to concentrate the decomplexed ni ii at trace level for resource recovery hydrated zr iv oxide hzo with high stability over broad ph range has shown specific affinity for heavy metal ions during adsorption hua et al 2013 pan et al 2013 to overcome the separation difficulty of nanoparticles in flow through systems it is considered an effective strategy to incorporate the nanoparticles in millimeter sized polymeric ion exchanger hosts lofrano et al 2016 herein we employed nhzo pce a nanocomposite adsorbent of nanosized hzo embedded in pce to immobilize the decomplexed ni ii meanwhile its anion exchanger hosted counterpart nhzo pae was also employed for comparative purpose the preparation methods of both nanocomposites are available in our previous studies hua et al 2013 pan et al 2013 2 3 2 ozonation process ozonation was performed in a 500 ml cylindrical glass reactor with thermostatic bath jacket to maintain the reaction temperature constant at 25 c ozone was generated from pure o2 by ozone generator 3s t5 tonglin beijing china and was then fed into the reactor from the bottom through a porous plate the ozone generator was pre run for 30 min before being fed into the reactor to ensure a stable gaseous o3 concentration which was online monitored by a uv detector uv 2100 ideal machine the ozone flow rate fed into the reactor was 0 20 l min and the gaseous o3 concentration was tuned by controlling the power of the ozone generator to vary the ozone input dosage at predetermined time intervals aliquots of solution were taken from the reactor followed by quenching with 1 0 m sodium sulfite huang et al 2016 to quantify the destruction of ni ii complexes during ozonation the samples collected at various time intervals were subjected to alkaline precipitation at ph 10 5 for 2 h to settle the decomplexed ni ii followed by filtration through a membrane filter 0 22 μm for analysis of residual ni to explore the role of hydroxyl radical in the ozonation decomplexation of ni tert butanol tba was employed as a classic scavenger the ozonated effluent denoted as s2 was also subjected to the same analysis procedures as the original en plating effluent s1 to demonstrate the molecular change of ni complexes during ozonation 2 3 3 adsorption process to further remove the decomplexed ni ii from the ozonated en plating effluent batch adsorption experiments were primarily conducted to compare the performance of the adsorbents therein the adsorbent dosage was 4 0 g l and the sealed flasks were shaken on a thermostat incubator 180 rpm at 298 k for 24 h to regenerate nhzo pce after ni ii adsorption the used adsorbent was washed with ultrapure water three times and sequentially soaked in 0 01 m hcl and then binary solution of naoh 0 10 m and nacl 0 85 m for 24 h respectively moreover the adsorption regeneration experiments were performed in five consecutive cycles to evaluate the reusability of the nanocomposite adsorbent for treating the ozonated en plating effluent the reusability experiments were conducted in triplicate and the standard deviations were plotted as error bars fixed bed column adsorption experiments were performed in a glass column 12 mm in diameter and 120 mm in height packed with 2 0 ml of nhzo pce or pce beads the ozonated effluent was fed into the glass column through a peristaltic pump bt01 40 lange china at flow rate of 5 0 bv h where bv represents bed volume 2 0 ml 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of ozonation on the ni ii complexes the effect of ozone input dosage on the decomplexation of ni ii from the en plating effluent during the ozonation is illustrated in fig s1 the degradation of ni ii complexes was significantly enhanced with the increase of ozone input dosage especially during the initial 10 min which was consistent with cu ii edta degradation during ozonation huang et al 2016 the residual ni fell below 0 1 mg l after 30 min at ozone input dosage of 20 mg min l but was not decreased with the further increase of ozone input dosage thus the ozone input dosage of 20 mg min l and the ozonation duration of 30 min were selected as economical values for the subsequent experiments the removal of ni was significantly inhibited in the presence of tba fig s2 demonstrating the considerable role of hydroxyl radical in the ozonation decomplexation the basic parameters of the en plating effluent before and after ozonation were compared in table s2 the ph slightly increased from 7 99 to 8 20 while the concentrations of cations ca2 k na mg2 anions cl no3 so4 2 total ni and total phosphorus remained almost unchanged the slight increase of phosphate concentration after ozonation reflected the mineralization of phosphorus induced by oxidation which could benefit the subsequent removal of phosphorus pan et al 2009 chen et al 2015 li et al 2015 as shown in table s2 the high conductivities of the effluents demonstrated their high salinity nevertheless hplc icp ms is an effective method to analyze the metal organic complexes in complexed matrices marcinkowska and baralkiewicz 2016 zhu et al 2017 hernandez et al 2018 the cic icp ms chromatograms of the samples s1 and s2 are depicted in fig 2 two evident peaks of cationic ni ii species at 1 96 and 8 61 min were observed in both samples of which the latter could be assigned to free ni ii due to its consistent retention time with standard nicl2 fig 2a however the corresponding peak heights would overestimate the free ni ii concentration in the effluents due to the interferences from 44ca16o 42ca18o and 23na37cl given that the concentration of ca was 1300 times that of ni and the concentration of na was even higher to quantify the free ni ii in the effluents their duplicate samples were filtrated with ic na spe cartridges prior to icp oes and the results were listed in table s3 notably the free ni ii remarkably increased from 0 07 to 0 30 mg l after ozonation indicating the efficient degradation of the ni ii complexes it can be foreseen that the total ni could readily meet the discharge standard 0 1 mg l with further treatment to settle the decomplexed ni ii given that the non free ni decreased to only 0 06 mg l after ozonation according to the separation mechanism of the employed cationic column ionpac cs12 cations of larger ionic radius and higher valence would be eluted at a longer retention time thus the other ni peak at 1 96 min for both s1 and s2 possibly attributed to the non free ni species suggested they were not retained by the cationic column at all hence the non free ni species therein should be neutral or negatively charged therefore aic icp ms was performed to further characterize the non free ni ii in the effluents at the theoretical ph of the aic mobile phase 12 5 most of free ni ii should be precipitated to exclude the possible interferences induced by trace anionic free ni ii in the forms of ni oh 3 or ni oh 4 2 fig s3 the standard nicl2 sample 0 3 mg ni l were also tested as control and no obvious peak was observed fig 3 d thus all the anionic peaks observed in the aic icp ms chromatograms fig 3 a c could be assigned to non free ni ii species for both s1 and its concentrated sample via spe two main peaks at 2 39 and 5 32 min appeared with two shoulder peaks at 2 96 and 5 01 min respectively and obviously the 5 32 peak corresponded to the predominant ni ii species fig 3 a b after ozonation the shoulder peaks were not observed and the major peak at 5 32 peak almost disappeared in addition the peak at 2 39 min was also greatly weakened the less components and lower response of the anionic non free ni ii species implied the efficient destruction of ni ii complexes during the ozonation process these observations were in agreement with the quantification results of non free ni ii after ozonation table s3 the sec icp ms chromatograms of s1 and s2 were illustrated in fig 4 to provide information on the molecular size of the ni ii complexes before and after ozonation it can be seen that the peaks were generally shifted to longer retention time after ozonation indicating the decrease in molecular size of the ni ii complexes accordingly the peak at 18 min in s2 was significantly intensified compared to s1 indicating the considerable generation of small molecular ni ii species during the ozonation process generally the sec icp ms results demonstrated the fragmentation of the ni ii complex molecules induced by ozonation on the basis of the above general analyses the ni ii species in the en plating effluent consisted of positively charged free ni ii and negatively charged non free ni ii the ozonation process could effectively degrade the ni ii complexes whilst releasing free ni ii 3 2 ligand identification of the ni ii complexes the molecular insight into the ni ii complexes in the en plating effluent was mainly obtained by hplc esi hrms where negative ionization mode was employed given that the ni ii complexes were negatively charged to exclude the interference induced by high salinity the ni ii complexes were concentrated and desalinated via spe with the widely used ppl columns waska et al 2015 boiteau et al 2016 no significant difference was observed in the icp ms chromatograms between the concentrated sample and the original one fig 3 a b indicating the reliability of the analysis of the ni ii complexes based on the concentrated samples the 58ni and 60ni hplc icp ms chromatograms of concentrated samples were depicted in fig 5 the consistency of the 58ni and 60ni chromatograms substantiated that the distinct peaks were all authentic ni ii bearing species without false signals induced by ions with identical mass numbers before ozonation six peaks were observed at 9 07 31 92 48 46 50 85 60 17 and 72 89 min while five peaks appeared at 8 57 30 32 59 51 72 64 and 73 23 min after ozonation respectively comparatively the peaks were slightly shifted to shorter retention time suggesting the increase of polarity of the degradation products of ni ii complexes according to the c18 column separation mechanism koslinski et al 2014 the greatly weakened intensities of the peaks also reflected the considerable destruction of ni ii complexes after ozonation the comparative chromatograms of cyanocobalamin in the hplc icp ms and hplc esi ms systems are illustrated in fig 6 the rentetion time of cyanocobalamin was 35 29 min and 32 26 min in the chromatograms of hplc icp ms fig s4a and hplc esi ms fig s4b respectively after calibration of the retention time axes of both systems with cyanocobalamin as the aligning indicator the precise m z values of the authenticated ni ii bearing complexes were obtained fig 6 and most of their molecular formulae were interpreted based on the seven golden rules kind and fiehn 2007 within 10 ppm of mass error tolerance table 1 among the five interpreted molecular formulae of the ni ii complexes in the biochemical treatment effluent s1 the averaged h c o c index of hydrogen deficiency ihd values were 0 96 0 26 and 10 3 respectively the low h c value and the high ihd value implied the high aromaticity of the ni ii complexes in biochemical treatment effluent and thereby the resistance to biodegradation kim et al 2006 phungsai et al 2016 moreover four out of the five identified ni ii complexes contained nitrogen in their ligands suggesting the plausible autocatalytic effect on the degradation of the complexes during ozonation owing to the electron donating groups munoz and von sonntag 2000 note that the combinational ms results could locate the concerned nitrogen atoms in the ligand coordinated with ni ii which could not be simply obtained from overall parameters of the water such as total n after ozonation the number of observed ni ii complexes decreased from 6 to 4 without any remaining molecular formulae in s1 indicating the elimination of most recalcitrant ni ii complexes and the structural change of the residual ni ii complexes during ozonation with respect to the three interpreted molecular formulae after ozonation s2 the averaged h c and o c values increased to 1 43 and 0 61 respectively while the averaged ihd values decreased to 4 33 indicating the ozone attack of the residual ni ii bearing complexes on the unsaturated bonds via addition reactions or on the activated aromatic rings via electrophilic attack jin et al 2012 besides the absolute intensities of the ni ii complex peaks decreased by around one order of magnitude fig 6 after ozonation demonstrating the effective removal of most ni ii complexes which would facilitate the subsequent sequestration of ni ii via selective adsorption processes 3 3 selective adsorption of the decomplexed ni ii 3 3 1 comparison of adsorbents the removal of ni ii from en plating effluent before and after ozonation by nhzo pce and the comparative adsorbents is illustrated in fig 7 first none of the adsorbents could effectively remove ni ii from the en plating effluent before ozonation s1 with residual ni all above 0 3 mg l although the ni ii complexes were mostly negatively charged the anion exchanger pae could hardly remove any ni because of the high concentration of coexisting anions such as so4 2 3998 mg l table s2 owing to the ozonation treatment of the en plating effluent the removal of ni ii by the four adsorbents increased to different extents and the final ni ii decreased to 0 06 mg l after adsorption by nhzo pce demonstrating the rational treatment of the en plating effluent by ozonation followed by selective adsorption as shown in table s3 the removal of ni ii 0 30 mg l during adsorption by nhzo pce perfectly matched the increase of free ni ii after ozonation indicating the sequestration of free ni ii by the nanocomposite notably nhzo pce was the only eligible one among the four investigated adsorbents to decrease the residual ni to below the mcl of 0 10 mg l although the ni ii complexes were mostly destructed to release free ni ii after ozonation the cation exchanger pce still failed to effectively remove ni ii mainly as a result of the high concentration of coexisting ca2 479 mg l table s2 which could greatly compete with ni2 for sulfonate groups of the host cation exchanger pce in contrast the hzo nanoparticles embedded in nhzo pce could sequester ni2 in the presence of such coexisting ions via specific adsorption hua et al 2013 liu et al 2019 which could be roughly explained by the hard and soft acids and bases hsab theory compared to the hard acid ca2 ni2 is a relatively soft acid and thereby has higher affinity for the hydrated zirconium oxide surface acting as a soft lewis base hua et al 2013 the effect of the functional groups of the hosting material could be reflected by the comparison between the nanocomposites of nhzo hosted by pce and pae the superior performance of nhzo pce over nhzo pae could attributed to the donnan membrane effect sarkar et al 2011 hua et al 2013 which enhanced the intra particle permeation of ni2 through the pore channels due to the electrostatic attraction force provided by the negatively charged sulfonate groups of pce in short the nanocomposite nhzo pce showed the best performance for sequestration of the decomplexed ni ii from the ozone treated en plating effluent 3 3 2 reusability of nhzo pce for treating the ozonated en plating effluent the removal of ni ii from the ozonated en plating effluent by nhzo pce in five consecutive adsorption regeneration cycles is illustrated in fig 8 amongst which nhzo pce was regenerated mainly with 0 10 m hcl throughout the five cycles the residual ni ii after adsorption was well below the mcl of 0 10 mg l demonstrating the stable performance of nhzo pce during the consecutive adsorption regeneration runs as shown in fig 8 the desorption percentage all reached above 99 throughout the five regeneration processes indicating the great potential of ni recycle as a resource with suitable processing such as diffusion dialysis bendova and weidlich 2018 given that the immobilized ni ii by nhzo pce was predominantly free ni ii the above results demonstrated the great potential of the nanocomposite nhzo pce for not only sustainable removal of decomplexed ni ii from the ozonated en plating effluents but also ni resource recycling 3 3 3 fixed bed adsorption the breakthrough profiles of ni from the ozonated en plating effluent through fixed bed packed with nhzo pce and pce were illustrated in fig 9 the breakthrough point of ni was set at 0 10 mg l according to the most stringent electroplating industry emission standard of china under the complicated matrix of the ozonated effluent especially high salinity table s2 the working capacity of nhzo pce was around 550 bv which was over 18 times that of the cation exchanger host pce 30 bv the above result further proved that the selective adsorption with nanocomposite nhzo pce had great potential for continuous removal of decomplexed ni ii from the ozonated en plating effluent with complicated matrix in flow through systems 4 conclusions in this study a systematic methodology was developed to identify the ligands of the ni ii complexes in en plating effluent icp ms and esi hrms revealed the presence of nitrogen in the ligands of most ni ii complexes implying the suitability of autocatalytic ozonation for efficient ni ii decomplexation guided by the molecular insights an advanced treatment scheme was rationally designed following the efficient decomplexation of ni ii with ozonation the nhzo pce nanocomposite exhibited large fixed bed working capacity to further immobilize the decomplexed ni ii and could be sustainably employed with hcl regeneration declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

18425,it has been long desired but challenging to forward the advanced treatment of wastewater from empirical trials towards scientific design due to the lack of molecular insight into the pollutants of concern herein we first established a systematic methodology to identify the ligands of ni ii complexes in an electroless nickel en plating effluent the presence of n containing groups in the ligands of most ni ii complexes was verified by time aligned icp ms and esi hrms implying the suitability of autocatalytic ozonation for efficient decomplexation thereby a combined process was proposed on the basis of ozonation to achieve over 83 decomplexation of ni ii initially at 0 36 mg l followed by selective ni ii sequestration for resource recovery combinational lc ms systems

currently prevailing technique with widened surface applicability including insulators fujii et al 2014 shao et al 2014 li et al 2015 gao et al 2017 however en plating also produces a large amount of nickel containing wastewater such as the rinsing effluent ying et al 1988 almazan ruiz et al 2015 the discharge of ni is seriously controlled due to its high toxicity pane et al 2003 zambelli et al 2016 and carcinogenicity lee et al 1995 as the globally largest en plating market china has lowered the maximum contaminant level mcl of overall ni in plating effluent to 0 1 mg l in sensitive areas zhang et al 2013 2014 posing a harsh challenge for the advanced treatment of en plating wastewater in a typical scheme for the treatment of plating effluent a physicochemical unit followed by a biological treatment unit is empirically adopted to remove the heavy metals and the organics therein respectively wen et al 2018 conventional physicochemical treatment processes including precipitation adsorption and ion exchange could efficiently remove free nickel ions dizge et al 2009 fu and wang 2011 lee 2013 unfortunately the en plating effluent originally contains a wide variety of organic chelating agents shacham diamand et al 2015 which remarkably enhance the stability of ni via complexation lohan et al 2015 boiteau et al 2016 therefore additional units for advanced treatment of the recalcitrant ni organic complexes are commonly required to meet the stringent discharge standard advanced oxidation processes aops mainly fenton and ozonation have been widely employed as tertiary treatment to destroy the heavy metal complexes in wastewater stemmler et al 2001 durante et al 2010 2011 huang et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 compared with fenton process ozonation has become an attractive alternative mainly due to its fe sludge free merit sadrnourmohamadi and gorczyca 2015 which could considerably reduce the cost of hazardous waste disposal with growing molecular understanding of the structure activity relationships during ozonation buffle and von gunten 2006 noethe et al 2009 pablo pocostales et al 2010 it has been realized that the type of ligands would significantly affect the decomplexation efficiency for example ligands with amine groups such as edta favor an autocatalytic process to enhance the degradation efficiency via catalytic production of oh radical during ozonation huang et al 2016 hence a rational scheme of advanced treatment of en plating effluent can be scientifically designed with molecular insight into the ni complexes compared with the empirical trials based on traditional rough information such as total ni and chemical oxygen demand cod as far as we are concerned the lack of systematic methodology to

changes of organic matter during water treatment processes cortes francisco et al 2014 michael kordatou et al 2015 the methodologies therein could not be directly applicable to ni complexes because the types of analyzed organic matter were not necessarily those complexing ni which actually dominated the behavior of the complexed metal recently boiteau et al 2016 implemented structural characterization of natural ni complexes via combinational mass spectrometry ms techniques however the superior complexity of the concerned secondary biological effluent of industrial wastewater over natural water definitely demands an upgraded methodology in this study we demonstrated a systematic methodology to identify the ligands of the ni ii complexes in a real en plating effluent mainly via time aligned inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms and electrospray ionization high resolution mass spectrometry esi hrms based on the molecular insights an advanced treatment scheme of ozonation decomplexation followed by nanocomposite adsorption was proposed the speciation change of the ni ii complexes before and after ozonation was particularly concerned and the decomplexed ni ii was further sequestered for resource recovery by selective adsorption with zr iv oxide nanocomposite we believe that this study will shed new light upon the molecular insight based rational design of advanced treatment of real wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and effluent sampling ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm was used for solution preparation and dilution cyanocobalamin tci shanghai

polymeric anion exchanger pae two types of commercial macroporous cation and anion exchangers 0 6 0 8 mm commercial names d001 and d201 respectively were kindly provided by jiangsu nju environmental technology co ltd the secondary effluent sample denoted as s1 was collected from a typical en plating plant in huizhou guangdong china which is located in one of the largest plating industrial parks in china all collected samples were filtered through cellulose membrane 0 45 μm and stored in the dark at 4 c until subsequent use 2 2 analysis 2 2 1 general analysis the ph and conductivity were measured using a portable multi parameter controller hq30d hach and total organic carbon toc was determined by a combustion type analyzer toc l shimadzu japan the total phosphorous and phosphate concentrations were determined by the molybdenum blue spectrophotometric method pan et al 2009 the concentrations of cl no3 and so4 2 were detected by an ion chromatography ic system ics 1100 dionex usa equipped with an anion column dionex ionpac as19 4 250 mm and a guard column dionex ionpac ag19 4 50 mm with 20 mmol l naoh as the eluent the total concentrations of ni ca k na mg were detected using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes icap 7400 thermo usa to differentiate the aqueous ni ii species by electrostatic charges the samples were subjected to spe through a na type cation exchange column cleanert ic na 1 ml agela to separate the cationic ni ii species 2 2 2 ic icp ms and sec icp ms analysis the combined ic icp ms or sec icp ms systems were employed to separate and identify the ni ii species wherein a six port valve is used to connect the hplc unit perkinelmer 200 to the icp ms unit nexion 300x perkinelmer cation ic cic anionic ic aic and size exclusion chromatography sec columns were respectively installed on the hplc apparatus to separate the ni ii species depending on different mechanisms the instrumentation parameters of both chromatographic systems are listed in table s1 2 2 3 ligand identification of ni ii complexes the organic species in the en plating effluent were concentrated by solid phase extraction spe as previously described method waska et al 2015 briefly the spe cartridges agilent bond elut ppl 1 0 g 6 ml were sequentially rinsed with 20 ml of pure methanol 10 ml of acidified ultrapure water ph 2 and 20 ml of ultrapure water 4 l of effluent samples with no ph adjustment passed through the ppl cartridges at flow rate of 5 ml min after extraction the cartridges were desalinated with 20 ml of ultrapure water and then eluted with 30 ml of absolute methanol the eluent was subjected to n2 purging at 50 c followed by dissolution in 10 ml and 5 ml of mixed methanol water solution 5 95 v v for the biochemical effluent sample and the ozonated sample respectively the eluted solution injection volume 50 μl was first analyzed on hplc icp ms to locate the ni ii complexes in the chromatogram in this case a c18 reversed phase column waters 4 6 150 mm 5 μm particle size was installed on the hplc icp ms system described above the organic species were separated over a linear gradient from 0 to 100 methanol during a period of 5 50 min followed by 10 min isocratic elution with methanol and another 30 min of isocratic elution with water at flow rate of 0 2 ml min the presence of methanol in the mobile phase might affect the sensitivity plasma temperature and stability of the icp ms analysis szpunar 2005 therefore oxygen was introduced into plasma to implement combustion of methanol as reported elsewhere lechtenfeld et al 2011 boiteau et al 2013 to obtain molecular insight into the ni ii complexes hplc esi hrms was performed on an integrated system of ultra performance liquid chromatograph uplc ultimate 3000 thermo connected with a hybrid quadrupole orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometer q exactive focus thermo equipped with a heated electrospray ionization source esi the chromatographic conditions were completely consistent with that of the hplc icp ms analysis and the following operating parameters were employed for ms analysis in negative ion mode resolution 35000 sheath gas flow rate 20 aux gas flow rate 5 spray voltage 3000 v capillary temperature 593 k although consistent chromatographic conditions were maintained in both hplc systems there might be a difference in retention time between different instruments to align their chromatograms cyanocobalamin was employed as an indicator to calibrate the retention time specifically the retention time of the m h peak m z 1353 560 was aligned with the corresponding 59co peak on the hplc icp ms chromatogram by applying a constant time offset an isotope pattern search algorithm was applied to detect the ni ii complexes by identifying m z and the valid isotopic abundance ratio which is in line with the natural abundance ratio 58ni 60ni 2 6 and mass differences between 58ni and 60ni within a mass tolerance of 0 006 m z meanwhile the retention time difference between the corresponding hplc icp ms peak was within 0 3 min 2 3 advanced treatment 2 3 1 process design the running effluent treatment scheme in the plant for ni removal was consisted of physicochemical treatment biochemical treatment fenton and biological aerated filter baf to meet the stringent discharge standard of ni the overdosed fe in the fenton unit brought about large amount of sludge which considerably elevated the operating cost due to the unsatisfactory efficiency of ni removal by the current treatment process alternative advanced oxidation technologies to replace fenton were in great demand wang et al 2019 among which ozonation was considered a promising option more importantly ozonation may outperform fenton in heavy metal decomplexation efficiency due to autocatalytic effect from the amine n bearing ligands huang et al 2016 for example our preliminary experiment showed that ni edta at identical ni concentration to the en plating effluent was much more efficiently decomplexed by ozonation than ni citrate while the efficiency order was reversed in fenton process fig 1 in this case the edta ligand were supposed to enhance the generation of oh radicals during ozonation due to the presence of amine n thus the molecular insights into the ligands of the ni complexes are of fundamental significance for the rational design of efficient advanced treatment of the en plating effluent in this study based on the ligand identification analysis of the en plating effluent which would be elucidated in the subsequent section ozonation was selected as the decomplexation technique due to the confirmed presence of n bearing groups in the ligands of ni complexes subsequently the ozonated effluent was subjected to selective ni ii adsorption by a millimeter sized nanocomposite in order to concentrate the decomplexed ni ii at trace level for resource recovery hydrated zr iv oxide hzo with high stability over broad ph range has shown specific affinity for heavy metal ions during adsorption hua et al 2013 pan et al 2013 to overcome the separation difficulty of nanoparticles in flow through systems it is considered an effective strategy to incorporate the nanoparticles in millimeter sized polymeric ion exchanger hosts lofrano et al 2016 herein we employed nhzo pce a nanocomposite adsorbent of nanosized hzo embedded in pce to immobilize the decomplexed ni ii meanwhile its anion exchanger hosted counterpart nhzo pae was also employed for comparative purpose the preparation methods of both nanocomposites are available in our previous studies hua et al 2013 pan et al 2013 2 3 2 ozonation process ozonation was performed in a 500 ml cylindrical glass reactor with thermostatic bath jacket to maintain the reaction temperature constant at 25 c ozone was generated from pure o2 by ozone generator 3s t5 tonglin beijing china and was then fed into the reactor from the bottom through a porous plate the ozone generator was pre run for 30 min before being fed into the reactor to ensure a stable gaseous o3 concentration which was online monitored by a uv detector uv 2100 ideal machine the ozone flow rate fed into the reactor was 0 20 l min and the gaseous o3 concentration was tuned by controlling the power of the ozone generator to vary the ozone input dosage at predetermined time intervals aliquots of solution were taken from the reactor followed by quenching with 1 0 m sodium sulfite huang et al 2016 to quantify the destruction of ni ii complexes during ozonation the samples collected at various time intervals were subjected to alkaline precipitation at ph 10 5 for 2 h to settle the decomplexed ni ii followed by filtration through a membrane filter 0 22 μm for analysis of residual ni to explore the role of hydroxyl radical in the ozonation decomplexation of ni tert butanol tba was employed as a classic scavenger the ozonated effluent denoted as s2 was also subjected to the same analysis procedures as the original en plating effluent s1 to demonstrate the molecular change of ni complexes during ozonation 2 3 3 adsorption process to further remove the decomplexed ni ii from the ozonated en plating effluent batch adsorption experiments were primarily conducted to compare the performance of the adsorbents therein the adsorbent dosage was 4 0 g l and the sealed flasks were shaken on a thermostat incubator 180 rpm at 298 k for 24 h to regenerate nhzo pce after ni ii adsorption the used adsorbent was washed with ultrapure water three times and sequentially soaked in 0 01 m hcl and then binary solution of naoh 0 10 m and nacl 0 85 m for 24 h respectively moreover the adsorption regeneration experiments were performed in five consecutive cycles to evaluate the reusability of the nanocomposite adsorbent for treating the ozonated en plating effluent the reusability experiments were conducted in triplicate and the standard deviations were plotted as error bars fixed bed column adsorption experiments were performed in a glass column 12 mm in diameter and 120 mm in height packed with 2 0 ml of nhzo pce or pce beads the ozonated effluent was fed into the glass column through a peristaltic pump bt01 40 lange china at flow rate of 5 0 bv h where bv represents bed volume 2 0 ml 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of ozonation on the ni ii complexes the effect of ozone input dosage on the decomplexation of ni ii from the en plating effluent during the ozonation is illustrated in fig s1 the degradation of ni ii complexes was significantly enhanced with the increase of ozone input dosage especially during the initial 10 min which was consistent with cu ii edta degradation during ozonation huang et al 2016 the residual ni fell below 0 1 mg l after 30 min at ozone input dosage of 20 mg min l but was not decreased with the further increase of ozone input dosage thus the ozone input dosage of 20 mg min l and the ozonation duration of 30 min were selected as economical values for the subsequent experiments the removal of ni was significantly inhibited in the presence of tba fig s2 demonstrating the considerable role of hydroxyl radical in the ozonation decomplexation the basic parameters of the en plating effluent before and after ozonation were compared in table s2 the ph slightly increased from 7 99 to 8 20 while the concentrations of cations ca2 k na mg2 anions cl no3 so4 2 total ni and total phosphorus remained almost unchanged the slight increase of phosphate concentration after ozonation reflected the mineralization of phosphorus induced by oxidation which could benefit the subsequent removal of phosphorus pan et al 2009 chen et al 2015 li et al 2015 as shown in table s2 the high conductivities of the effluents demonstrated their high salinity nevertheless hplc icp ms is an effective method to analyze the metal organic complexes in complexed matrices marcinkowska and baralkiewicz 2016 zhu et al 2017 hernandez et al 2018 the cic icp ms chromatograms of the samples s1 and s2 are depicted in fig 2 two evident peaks of cationic ni ii species at 1 96 and 8 61 min were observed in both samples of which the latter could be assigned to free ni ii due to its consistent retention time with standard nicl2 fig 2a however the corresponding peak heights would overestimate the free ni ii concentration in the effluents due to the interferences from 44ca16o 42ca18o and 23na37cl given that the concentration of ca was 1300 times that of ni and the concentration of na was even higher to quantify the free ni ii in the effluents their duplicate samples were filtrated with ic na spe cartridges prior to icp oes and the results were listed in table s3 notably the free ni ii remarkably increased from 0 07 to 0 30 mg l after ozonation indicating the efficient degradation of the ni ii complexes it can be foreseen that the total ni could readily meet the discharge standard 0 1 mg l with further treatment to settle the decomplexed ni ii given that the non free ni decreased to only 0 06 mg l after ozonation according to the separation mechanism of the employed cationic column ionpac cs12 cations of larger ionic radius and higher valence would be eluted at a longer retention time thus the other ni peak at 1 96 min for both s1 and s2 possibly attributed to the non free ni species suggested they were not retained by the cationic column at all hence the non free ni species therein should be neutral or negatively charged therefore aic icp ms was performed to further characterize the non free ni ii in the effluents at the theoretical ph of the aic mobile phase 12 5 most of free ni ii should be precipitated to exclude the possible interferences induced by trace anionic free ni ii in the forms of ni oh 3 or ni oh 4 2 fig s3 the standard nicl2 sample 0 3 mg ni l were also tested as control and no obvious peak was observed fig 3 d thus all the anionic peaks observed in the aic icp ms chromatograms fig 3 a c could be assigned to non free ni ii species for both s1 and its concentrated sample via spe two main peaks at 2 39 and 5 32 min appeared with two shoulder peaks at 2 96 and 5 01 min respectively and obviously the 5 32 peak corresponded to the predominant ni ii species fig 3 a b after ozonation the shoulder peaks were not observed and the major peak at 5 32 peak almost disappeared in addition the peak at 2 39 min was also greatly weakened the less components and lower response of the anionic non free ni ii species implied the efficient destruction of ni ii complexes during the ozonation process these observations were in agreement with the quantification results of non free ni ii after ozonation table s3 the sec icp ms chromatograms of s1 and s2 were illustrated in fig 4 to provide information on the molecular size of the ni ii complexes before and after ozonation it can be seen that the peaks were generally shifted to longer retention time after ozonation indicating the decrease in molecular size of the ni ii complexes accordingly the peak at 18 min in s2 was significantly intensified compared to s1 indicating the considerable generation of small molecular ni ii species during the ozonation process generally the sec icp ms results demonstrated the fragmentation of the ni ii complex molecules induced by ozonation on the basis of the above general analyses the ni ii species in the en plating effluent consisted of positively charged free ni ii and negatively charged non free ni ii the ozonation process could effectively degrade the ni ii complexes whilst releasing free ni ii 3 2 ligand identification of the ni ii complexes the molecular insight into the ni ii complexes in the en plating effluent was mainly obtained by hplc esi hrms where negative ionization mode was employed given that the ni ii complexes were negatively charged to exclude the interference induced by high salinity the ni ii complexes were concentrated and desalinated via spe with the widely used ppl columns waska et al 2015 boiteau et al 2016 no significant difference was observed in the icp ms chromatograms between the concentrated sample and the original one fig 3 a b indicating the reliability of the analysis of the ni ii complexes based on the concentrated samples the 58ni and 60ni hplc icp ms chromatograms of concentrated samples were depicted in fig 5 the consistency of the 58ni and 60ni chromatograms substantiated that the distinct peaks were all authentic ni ii bearing species without false signals induced by ions with identical mass numbers before ozonation six peaks were observed at 9 07 31 92 48 46 50 85 60 17 and 72 89 min while five peaks appeared at 8 57 30 32 59 51 72 64 and 73 23 min after ozonation respectively comparatively the peaks were slightly shifted to shorter retention time suggesting the increase of polarity of the degradation products of ni ii complexes according to the c18 column separation mechanism koslinski et al 2014 the greatly weakened intensities of the peaks also reflected the considerable destruction of ni ii complexes after ozonation the comparative chromatograms of cyanocobalamin in the hplc icp ms and hplc esi ms systems are illustrated in fig 6 the rentetion time of cyanocobalamin was 35 29 min and 32 26 min in the chromatograms of hplc icp ms fig s4a and hplc esi ms fig s4b respectively after calibration of the retention time axes of both systems with cyanocobalamin as the aligning indicator the precise m z values of the authenticated ni ii bearing complexes were obtained fig 6 and most of their molecular formulae were interpreted based on the seven golden rules kind and fiehn 2007 within 10 ppm of mass error tolerance table 1 among the five interpreted molecular formulae of the ni ii complexes in the biochemical treatment effluent s1 the averaged h c o c index of hydrogen deficiency ihd values were 0 96 0 26 and 10 3 respectively the low h c value and the high ihd value implied the high aromaticity of the ni ii complexes in biochemical treatment effluent and thereby the resistance to biodegradation kim et al 2006 phungsai et al 2016 moreover four out of the five identified ni ii complexes contained nitrogen in their ligands suggesting the plausible autocatalytic effect on the degradation of the complexes during ozonation owing to the electron donating groups munoz and von sonntag 2000 note that the combinational ms results could locate the concerned nitrogen atoms in the ligand coordinated with ni ii which could not be simply obtained from overall parameters of the water such as total n after ozonation the number of observed ni ii complexes decreased from 6 to 4 without any remaining molecular formulae in s1 indicating the elimination of most recalcitrant ni ii complexes and the structural change of the residual ni ii complexes during ozonation with respect to the three interpreted molecular formulae after ozonation s2 the averaged h c and o c values increased to 1 43 and 0 61 respectively while the averaged ihd values decreased to 4 33 indicating the ozone attack of the residual ni ii bearing complexes on the unsaturated bonds via addition reactions or on the activated aromatic rings via electrophilic attack jin et al 2012 besides the absolute intensities of the ni ii complex peaks decreased by around one order of magnitude fig 6 after ozonation demonstrating the effective removal of most ni ii complexes which would facilitate the subsequent sequestration of ni ii via selective adsorption processes 3 3 selective adsorption of the decomplexed ni ii 3 3 1 comparison of adsorbents the removal of ni ii from en plating effluent before and after ozonation by nhzo pce and the comparative adsorbents is illustrated in fig 7 first none of the adsorbents could effectively remove ni ii from the en plating effluent before ozonation s1 with residual ni all above 0 3 mg l although the ni ii complexes were mostly negatively charged the anion exchanger pae could hardly remove any ni because of the high concentration of coexisting anions such as so4 2 3998 mg l table s2 owing to the ozonation treatment of the en plating effluent the removal of ni ii by the four adsorbents increased to different extents and the final ni ii decreased to 0 06 mg l after adsorption by nhzo pce demonstrating the rational treatment of the en plating effluent by ozonation followed by selective adsorption as shown in table s3 the removal of ni ii 0 30 mg l during adsorption by nhzo pce perfectly matched the increase of free ni ii after ozonation indicating the sequestration of free ni ii by the nanocomposite notably nhzo pce was the only eligible one among the four investigated adsorbents to decrease the residual ni to below the mcl of 0 10 mg l although the ni ii complexes were mostly destructed to release free ni ii after ozonation the cation exchanger pce still failed to effectively remove ni ii mainly as a result of the high concentration of coexisting ca2 479 mg l table s2 which could greatly compete with ni2 for sulfonate groups of the host cation exchanger pce in contrast the hzo nanoparticles embedded in nhzo pce could sequester ni2 in the presence of such coexisting ions via specific adsorption hua et al 2013 liu et al 2019 which could be roughly explained by the hard and soft acids and bases hsab theory compared to the hard acid ca2 ni2 is a relatively soft acid and thereby has higher affinity for the hydrated zirconium oxide surface acting as a soft lewis base hua et al 2013 the effect of the functional groups of the hosting material could be reflected by the comparison between the nanocomposites of nhzo hosted by pce and pae the superior performance of nhzo pce over nhzo pae could attributed to the donnan membrane effect sarkar et al 2011 hua et al 2013 which enhanced the intra particle permeation of ni2 through the pore channels due to the electrostatic attraction force provided by the negatively charged sulfonate groups of pce in short the nanocomposite nhzo pce showed the best performance for sequestration of the decomplexed ni ii from the ozone treated en plating effluent 3 3 2 reusability of nhzo pce for treating the ozonated en plating effluent the removal of ni ii from the ozonated en plating effluent by nhzo pce in five consecutive adsorption regeneration cycles is illustrated in fig 8 amongst which nhzo pce was regenerated mainly with 0 10 m hcl throughout the five cycles the residual ni ii after adsorption was well below the mcl of 0 10 mg l demonstrating the stable performance of nhzo pce during the consecutive adsorption regeneration runs as shown in fig 8 the desorption percentage all reached above 99 throughout the five regeneration processes indicating the great potential of ni recycle as a resource with suitable processing such as diffusion dialysis bendova and weidlich 2018 given that the immobilized ni ii by nhzo pce was predominantly free ni ii the above results demonstrated the great potential of the nanocomposite nhzo pce for not only sustainable removal of decomplexed ni ii from the ozonated en plating effluents but also ni resource recycling 3 3 3 fixed bed adsorption the breakthrough profiles of ni from the ozonated en plating effluent through fixed bed packed with nhzo pce and pce were illustrated in fig 9 the breakthrough point of ni was set at 0 10 mg l according to the most stringent electroplating industry emission standard of china under the complicated matrix of the ozonated effluent especially high salinity table s2 the working capacity of nhzo pce was around 550 bv which was over 18 times that of the cation exchanger host pce 30 bv the above result further proved that the selective adsorption with nanocomposite nhzo pce had great potential for continuous removal of decomplexed ni ii from the ozonated en plating effluent with complicated matrix in flow through systems 4 conclusions in this study a systematic methodology was developed to identify the ligands of the ni ii complexes in en plating effluent icp ms and esi hrms revealed the presence of nitrogen in the ligands of most ni ii complexes implying the suitability of autocatalytic ozonation for efficient ni ii decomplexation guided by the molecular insights an advanced treatment scheme was rationally designed following the efficient decomplexation of ni ii with ozonation the nhzo pce nanocomposite exhibited large fixed bed working capacity to further immobilize the decomplexed ni ii and could be sustainably employed with hcl regeneration declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

not genes conferring resistance to carbapenems β lactams fluoroquinolones and macrolides were below detection limit in all treatments besides the higher availability of nutrients under treatment conditions favored bacterial growth in comparison to those exposed to control conditions particularly acinetobacter spp and pseudomonas spp were significantly enriched after 22 days of treatment exposure the presence of cefotaxime a third generation cephalosporine in the feeding medium caused an enrichment of bacterial communities in sequences affiliated to acinetobacter thus suggesting that these resistant forms may possess resistance genes other than those studied here bla ctx m bla oxa and bla kpc although derived from a mesocosm experiment in continuous cultures our results call

inhibitory concentrations do not only favor the maintenance of args in a given habitat but they also promote the dissemination of args between pathogenic and non pathogenic bacteria taylor et al 2011

influence of the chemical characteristics of the hqwr on bacterial communities moreover the manipulation of the hqwr with the addition of the antibiotic cefotaxime allowed us to determine a direct impact on bacterial abundance and their resistance profile of a third generation cephalosporin of high clinical relevance rice 2012 the experimental setup consisted in 9 chemostat vessels mimicking the conditions occurring in natural aquatic habitats the experimental system was further implemented with artificial substrates concretely plastic carriers that favor the growth of biofilm to evaluate possible differences in adaptation between the planktonic and the benthic community the resident communities were exposed for 22 days to hqwr as a sole pollution source or in combination with a 5 μg l

on the natural bacterial community modify their established interactions and as a consequence the bacterial community composition and that the presence of antibiotic residues within the effluents can easily stimulate the emergence of antibiotic resistance in natural environments 2 material and methods 2 1 uwtp in verbania the uwtp in verbania 45 93 17 n 8 56 61 e treats wastewater from 51 000

planktonic and biofilm associated microorganisms collected from the dystrophic mercurago lagoon planktonic microorganisms were obtained by collecting water at about 1 5 m below the surface and at about 1 m above the bottom of the lagoon the water was kept in the dark and at 6 c and immediately brought to the laboratory where 10 l were filtered through 100 μm pore size membranes to remove large debris and zooplankton biofilm associated microorganisms were obtained by scrapping biofilms growing on the surface of cobbles epilithic biofilms collected from the lagoon approximately 50 ml of the planktonic and biofilm suspension mixture defined as the inoculum along the article was used to inoculate the chemostat vessels before starting the experiment the inoculated vessels were maintained under batch conditions for 4 days at 12 c to allow the stabilization of the microbial planktonic community in the chemostats as well as the formation of biofilms on the plastic carriers after a few days stabilization and colonization were achieved and the chemostats operated in continuous flow mode by constantly pumping fresh medium in the three treatments ct hqwr and hqwr ab using a multichannel peristaltic pump watson marlow 205s at a dilution rate of d 0 1 d 1 due to abiotic degradation of cefotaxime in water the hqwr ab treatment medium was replaced every three days to

similar values among non impacted and impacted treatments suppl table s4 cefotaxime was only detected in water samples collected from the hqwr ab treatment suppl table s5 the average concentration of

analyzed was below the detection limit of the method used in all samples suppl table s6 before treatment started the feeding medium of the non impacted ct and impacted hqwr and hqwr ab treatments contained 8 69 105 and 5 80 105 cells ml 1 respectively since these cells originated from the autoclaved lagoon water they were considered not viable the inoculum contained 8 12 106 6 55 105 cells ml

conferring resistance to cefotaxime bla ctx m bla oxa and bla kpc β lactams bla tem fluoroquinolones qnrs and macrolides ermb were always below the detection limit of the qpcr assay in all samples from all tested args only sul2 and teta were detected at concentrations above the limit of the quantification the same applied to inti1 arsb and czca genes all these genes were also detected in the feeding medium and or the inoculum suppl table s8 particularly sul2 was the only gene detected in the feeding medium of the ct treatment while teta and czca were also detected in the feeding medium of the impacted treatments hqwr and hqwr ab at relative concentrations ranging from 1 69 10 3 to 1 35 10 2 copies per 16s rrna gene copy all target genes were detected in the inoculum but at lower concentrations than those measured in the feeding medium of the impacted treatments after 22 days fig 2 suppl table s9 the relative concentration of the inti1 gene was similar between hqwr and hqwr ab

hqwr ab treatment showed a more severe impact on the concentration of sul2 in water samples compared to biofilm samples this observation was further corroborated by the significant interaction between

bacterial communities the bacterial community of the inoculum was dominated by sequences affiliated to bacteroidetes 48 41 11 33 and to a lesser extent to betaproteobacteria 17 75 4 03 and actinobacteria 11 85 1 97 fig 3 after 22 days the composition of planktonic and biofilm bacterial communities was dominated by betaproteobacteria 42 57 18 74 25 52 2 73 verrucomicrobia 28 08 14 17 19 63 5 31 and alfaproteobacteria 13 77 10 26 13 48 1 39 respectively the effect of the treatment and of the type of substrate on the composition of the planktonic and biofilm bacterial communities was assessed using the bray curtis similarity distance fig 4 principal coordinate analysis pcoa showed that 40 4 of the variability was accounted for the type of substrate permanova p 0 001 fig 4a the composition of bacterial communities under control conditions clustered together and significantly segregated from those exposed to the experimental impacted hqwr p 0 001 and hqwr ab p 0 001 regardless of the substrate type fig 4a notwithstanding this bacterial communities from hqwr and hqwr ab also showed significant differences on their composition p 0 004 fig 4b differences in bacterial community composition between the ct and impacted treatments hqwr and hqwr ab were mainly attributed to changes on the relative abundance of sequences affiliated to genera acinetobacter and pseudomonas and to unclassified verrucomicrobia fig 5 sequences affiliated to genera acinetobacter and pseudomonas accounted for 0 005 0 0 and 0 28 0 29 of the overall bacterial communities in ct but increased to 14 15 3 05 and 13 39 6 54 in the impacted treatments hqwr and hqwr ab in contrast the relative abundance of sequences affiliated to verrucomicrobia decreased by 16 33 in the impacted treatments compared to the non exposed treatment fig 5 table 1 4 discussion this study is aimed to elucidate under controlled conditions the effect of hqwr on the abundance and composition of indigenous bacterial communities which were never exposed to direct anthropogenic pollution hqwr had a significant impact on the abundance of most of those genes that were previously detected in the feeding medium and or the inoculum teta inti1 arsb and czca however the addition of 5 μg l 1 of cefotaxime a third generation cephalosporin in the hqwr did not cause a severe impact on the abundance of the analyzed genes since genes conferring resistance to third generation cephalosporins bla ctx m bla oxa and bla kpc were not detected in any of the samples these results suggest that exposure to 5 μg l 1 cefotaxime although suitable for selecting cefotaxime resistance bacteria bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 might not lead to the selection of de novo mutants resistance to cefotaxime under our experimental conditions previous studies already highlighted that sub inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics in environmental settings may favor the maintenance and selection of resistant bacteria within a given community andersson and hughes 2014 altering its composition eckert et al 2019 the concentration of the 53 antibiotics measured in the hqwr belonging to the main antibiotic families were below the detection limit of the method ranging from 3 6 to 36 ng l 1 see suppl table s6 concretely the method detection limit of the four tetracycline antibiotics analyzed ranged from 8 1 to 25 2 ng l 1 in this regard the increase of the relative abundance of teta gene in planktonic communities exposed to hqwr suggests that maintenance and selection of tetracycline bacteria resistance can occur in even very low concentration of the antibiotic 25 2 ng l 1 notwithstanding this the observed increase in the relative abundance of teta gene may be the result of a combined effect of different stressors present in the hqwr including the nutrient load su et al 2014 the higher nutrient concentration in the hqwr compared to the control medium may have favored hgt events within bacterial communities as a result of enhanced metabolic rates elsas et al 2003 in fact bacterial communities exposed to both hqwr and hqwr amended with low dose of cefotaxime showed higher growth rates than those exposed to the control medium probably due to larger presence of labile nutrients recent studies have shown that nutrients may induce an increase in the abundance of the inti1 gene in streambed biofilms under the combined effect of pharmaceutical compounds lehmann et al 2016 subirats et al 2018 these findings may provide a plausible explanation for the prevalence of inti1 gene in both biofilm and planktonic bacterial communities exposed to hqwr these results support the hypothesis that the inti1 gene is a suitable proxy for anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 even when bacterial communities are exposed to high quality wastewater that is considered safe for agricultural irrigation according to the italian law dm 185 2003 this is particularly worrisome since inti1 gene is usually linked to a several resistance genes and thus can favors the co selection of genes conferring resistance to antibiotics and metals seiler and berendonk 2012 in this regard our study also showed that hqwr may also favors the persistence of mrgs probably due to the presence of low concentration of metals suppl table s1 therefore if both the args and mrgs were located in a genetic platform that are usually integrated into plasmid such as a class 1 integrons it can also maintain and select antibiotics resistance in bacterial communities in the absence of antibiotics pal et al 2017 we also investigated the potential differences in adaptation between the planktonic and biofilm communities our results suggested that planktonic communities tend to be more sensitive to environmental pressure than those in biofilms the higher resistance of biofilm communities might be due to the intrinsic protection conferred by extracellular matrix of polysaccharides towards environmental hazards costerton et al 1978 despite the complex structure of the polysaccharide biofilm matrix allows bacteria to exhibit 10 to 100 times less susceptibility to antimicrobial compounds compared to planktonic bacterial cells gilbert et al 2002 it also provides a favorable environment for gene transfer gillings et al 2009 molin and tolker nielsen 2003 this feature among others has lead bacterial biofilms to be considered a suitable biosensor to evaluate the impact of long term anthropogenic pollution exposure on the prevalence of antibiotics resistance in surface waters balcázar et al 2015 subirats et al 2017 in aquatic ecosystems environmental factors play a critical role in shaping the composition of bacterial communities winter et al 2007 previous studies have shown that wastewater can modify the microbial communities in the receiving waters through both altering physicochemical characteristics of the habitat lu and lu 2014 saarenheimo et al 2017 and bringing in wastewater associated bacteria subirats et al 2017 herein we demonstrated that hqwr can also significantly change the composition of bacterial communities never exposed to direct anthropogenic pollution after 22 days of exposure to hqwr both planktonic and biofilm bacterial communities were enriched in members affiliated to acinetobacter and pseudomonas spp this result may be largely due to the difference on chemical characteristics of the dissolved organic matter dom present in the medium that fed the different treatments of our experiment the medium feeding bacterial communities in the control treatment was natural water from the mercurago lagoon italy that presents high proportion of refractory organic carbon consisting in high molecular weight and structural complex compounds e g humic acids and lignin the treated wastewater is rich in labile organic carbon fuentes rivas et al 2017 that favors growth efficiency church et al 2000 of bacteria especially those that are good competitors under selective pressures e g chemical stressors in wastewater such as acinetobacter and pseudomonas spp atrouni et al 2016 farvo 2017 moreover acinetobacter spp were favored by the addition of 5 μg l 1 of cefotaxime antibiotic in the hqwr suggesting that they may carry genes conferring resistance to cefotaxime other than those analyzed in the present study bla ctx m bla oxa and bla kpc indeed acinetobacter spp have been found to carry different genes conferring resistance to carbapenems such as bla vim bla imp and bla sim as well as to easily acquire resistance against aminoglycosides ampicillins tetracyclines gentamicin and tobramycin prashanth and badrinath 2005 unlike acinetobacter spp members within pseudomonas genus were sensitive to cefotaxime antibiotic since their relative abundance decreased in those samples exposed to hqwr ab treatment the enrichment of both acinetobacter and pseudomonas spp in those samples exposed to the hqwr is an important result since both genera encompass several multidrug resistant human pathogens largely related to nosocomial infections doughari et al 2011 farvo 2017 since the introduction of arb and args into the food chain through crop plants grown under reuse wastewater irrigated soil has been shown christou et al 2017 the use of wastewater for irrigation could lead to potential human health impacts 5 conclusions our work provides evidences that the presence of emerging contaminants and nutrient availability in hqwr can pose a large threat to the environment concretely this experiment demonstrated that reclaimed wastewater significantly contributed to increase both the resistance genes pool and the likelihood of gene transfer among bacteria population in aquatic environments besides hqwr favored the growth of acinetobacter and pseudomonas spp in both planktonic and biofilm communities both genus are known to encompass multidrug resistant opportunistic pathogens doughari et al 2011 farvo 2017 although there are still many knowledge gaps to properly define the risk of transmission of antibiotic resistance from the environment to humans the use of high quality treated wastewater for agricultural purposes may represent a direct threat to human health in this sense we highlight the need to carry out in situ real scale experiments and if needed to re define the suitability of reclaimed water parameters and to implement rigorous protocols for the safely use of reclaimed water to avoid undesired effects on the composition of microbial communities and the

18426,we carry out a mesocosms experiment to assess the impact of high quality treated wastewater intended for agricultural reuse hqwr on freshwater bacteria seldom exposed to anthropogenic pollution effects were assessed by comparing the abundance and composition of bacterial communities as well as their resistance profile under control source water from an unpolluted lake and treatment

not genes conferring resistance to carbapenems β lactams fluoroquinolones and macrolides were below detection limit in all treatments besides the higher availability of nutrients under treatment conditions favored bacterial growth in comparison to those exposed to control conditions particularly acinetobacter spp and pseudomonas spp were significantly enriched after 22 days of treatment exposure the presence of cefotaxime a third generation cephalosporine in the feeding medium caused an enrichment of bacterial communities in sequences affiliated to acinetobacter thus suggesting that these resistant forms may possess resistance genes other than those studied here bla ctx m bla oxa and bla kpc although derived from a mesocosm experiment in continuous cultures our results call attention to the need of refined regulations regarding the use of reclaimed water in agriculture since even high quality treated wastewater may lead to undesired effects on receiving bacterial

suitability of reclaimed water for crop irrigation is assessed through the monitoring of several chemical and biological indicators such as the concentration of inorganic salts heavy metals emerging

inhibitory concentrations do not only favor the maintenance of args in a given habitat but they also promote the dissemination of args between pathogenic and non pathogenic bacteria taylor et al 2011 moreover the concomitant presence of antibiotics and metals either within the uwtp or in the receiving water body may favor the selection and spread of multidrug resistant bacteria di cesare et al

selective pressure exerted by antibiotic residues on resident bacteria thus stimulating the selection of resistant phylotypes and the exchange of args among cells via mobile genetic elements ii the colonization of the natural habitat by arb derived from the uwtp and discharged into the stream or iii a combination of both the goal of this study was to assess the impact of a constant feeding by high quality wastewater for agricultural reuse hqwr on a natural microbial community which was seldom exposed to anthropogenic pollution this controlled experiment allowed us to shed light on the influence of the chemical characteristics of the hqwr on bacterial communities moreover the manipulation of the hqwr with the addition of the antibiotic cefotaxime allowed us to determine a direct impact on bacterial abundance and their resistance profile of a third generation cephalosporin of high clinical relevance rice 2012 the experimental setup consisted in 9 chemostat vessels mimicking the conditions occurring in natural aquatic habitats the experimental system was further implemented with artificial substrates concretely plastic carriers that favor the growth of biofilm to evaluate possible differences in adaptation between the planktonic and the benthic community the resident communities were exposed for 22 days to hqwr as a sole pollution source or in combination with a 5 μg l 1 of cefotaxime antibiotic the microbial communities were screened for bacterial abundance community structure and abundance of args and mrgs our working hypothesis was that hqwr might have an impact on the natural bacterial community modify their established interactions and as a consequence the bacterial community composition and that the presence of antibiotic residues within the effluents can easily stimulate the emergence of antibiotic resistance in natural environments 2 material and methods 2 1 uwtp in verbania the uwtp in verbania 45 93 17 n 8 56 61 e treats wastewater from 51 000

planktonic and biofilm associated microorganisms collected from the dystrophic mercurago lagoon planktonic microorganisms were obtained by collecting water at about 1 5 m below the surface and at about 1 m above the bottom of the lagoon the water was kept in the dark and at 6 c and immediately brought to the laboratory where 10 l were filtered through 100 μm pore size membranes to remove large debris and zooplankton biofilm associated microorganisms were obtained by scrapping biofilms growing on the surface of cobbles epilithic biofilms collected from the lagoon approximately 50 ml of the planktonic and biofilm suspension mixture defined as the inoculum along the article was used to inoculate the chemostat vessels before starting the experiment the inoculated vessels were maintained under batch conditions for 4 days at 12 c to allow the stabilization of the microbial planktonic community in the chemostats as well as the formation of biofilms on the plastic carriers after a few days stabilization and colonization were achieved and the chemostats operated in continuous flow mode by constantly pumping fresh medium in the three treatments ct hqwr and hqwr ab using a multichannel peristaltic pump watson marlow 205s at a dilution rate of d 0 1 d 1 due to abiotic degradation of cefotaxime in water the hqwr ab treatment medium was replaced every three days to

analyzed was below the detection limit of the method used in all samples suppl table s6 before treatment started the feeding medium of the non impacted ct and impacted hqwr and hqwr ab treatments contained 8 69 105 and 5 80 105 cells ml 1 respectively since these cells originated from the autoclaved lagoon water they were considered not viable the inoculum contained 8 12 106 6 55 105 cells ml

conferring resistance to cefotaxime bla ctx m bla oxa and bla kpc β lactams bla tem fluoroquinolones qnrs and macrolides ermb were always below the detection limit of the qpcr assay in all samples from all tested args only sul2 and teta were detected at concentrations above the limit of the quantification the same applied to inti1 arsb and czca genes all these genes were also detected in the feeding medium and or the inoculum suppl table s8 particularly sul2 was the only gene detected in the feeding medium of the ct treatment while teta and czca were also detected in the feeding medium of the impacted treatments hqwr and hqwr ab at relative concentrations ranging from 1 69 10 3 to 1 35 10 2 copies per 16s rrna gene copy all target genes were detected in the inoculum but at lower concentrations than those measured in the feeding medium of the impacted treatments after 22 days fig 2 suppl table s9 the relative concentration of the inti1 gene was similar between hqwr and hqwr ab treatments and significantly higher compared to ct treatment kruskal wallis test p 0 010 however no significant differences in inti1 abundance was detected across substrates water biofilm kruskal wallis test p 0 119 the relative abundance of the sul2 gene was not significantly affected neither by treatments two way anova p 0 214 nor by substrate two way anova p 0 37 notwithstanding this the hqwr ab treatment showed a more severe impact on the concentration of sul2 in water samples compared to biofilm samples this observation was further corroborated by the significant interaction between the corresponding factors treatments and substrate two way anova p 0 043 teta was not detected in all biofilm samples whereas it was only quantifiable in water samples from hqwr and hqwr ab without

bacterial communities the bacterial community of the inoculum was dominated by sequences affiliated to bacteroidetes 48 41 11 33 and to a lesser extent to betaproteobacteria 17 75 4 03 and actinobacteria 11 85 1 97 fig 3 after 22 days the composition of planktonic and biofilm bacterial communities was dominated by betaproteobacteria 42 57 18 74 25 52 2 73 verrucomicrobia 28 08 14 17 19 63 5 31 and alfaproteobacteria 13 77 10 26 13 48 1 39 respectively the effect of the treatment and of the type of substrate on the composition of the planktonic and biofilm bacterial communities was assessed using the bray curtis similarity distance fig 4 principal coordinate analysis pcoa showed that 40 4 of the variability was accounted for the type of substrate permanova p 0 001 fig 4a the composition of bacterial communities under control conditions clustered together and significantly segregated from those exposed to the experimental impacted hqwr p 0 001 and hqwr ab p 0 001 regardless of the substrate type fig 4a notwithstanding this bacterial communities from hqwr and hqwr ab also showed significant differences on their composition p 0 004 fig 4b differences in bacterial community composition between the ct and impacted treatments hqwr and hqwr ab were mainly attributed to changes on the relative abundance of sequences affiliated to genera acinetobacter and pseudomonas and to unclassified verrucomicrobia fig 5 sequences affiliated to genera acinetobacter and pseudomonas accounted for 0 005 0 0 and 0 28 0 29 of the overall bacterial communities in ct but increased to 14 15 3 05 and 13 39 6 54 in the impacted treatments hqwr and hqwr ab in contrast the relative abundance of sequences affiliated to verrucomicrobia decreased by 16 33 in the impacted treatments compared to the non exposed treatment fig 5 table 1 4 discussion this study is aimed to elucidate under controlled conditions the effect of hqwr on the abundance and composition of indigenous bacterial communities which were never exposed to direct anthropogenic pollution hqwr had a significant impact on the abundance of most of those genes that were previously detected in the feeding medium and or the inoculum teta inti1 arsb and czca however the addition of 5 μg l 1 of cefotaxime a third generation cephalosporin in the hqwr did not cause a severe impact on the abundance of the analyzed genes since genes conferring resistance to third generation cephalosporins bla ctx m bla oxa and bla kpc were not detected in any of the samples these results suggest that exposure to 5 μg l 1 cefotaxime although suitable for selecting cefotaxime resistance bacteria bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 might not lead to the selection of de novo mutants resistance to cefotaxime under our experimental conditions previous studies already highlighted that sub inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics in environmental settings may favor the maintenance and selection of resistant bacteria within a given community andersson and hughes 2014 altering its composition eckert et al 2019 the concentration of the 53 antibiotics measured in the hqwr belonging to the main antibiotic families were below the detection limit of the method ranging from 3 6 to 36 ng l 1 see suppl table s6 concretely the method detection limit of the four tetracycline antibiotics analyzed ranged from 8 1 to 25 2 ng l 1 in this regard the increase of the relative abundance of teta gene in planktonic communities exposed to hqwr suggests that maintenance and selection of tetracycline bacteria resistance can occur in even very low concentration of the antibiotic 25 2 ng l 1 notwithstanding this the observed increase in the relative abundance of teta gene may be the result of a combined effect of different stressors present in the hqwr including the nutrient load su et al 2014 the higher nutrient concentration in the hqwr compared to the control medium may have favored hgt events within bacterial communities as a result of enhanced metabolic rates elsas et al 2003 in fact bacterial communities exposed to both hqwr and hqwr amended with low dose of cefotaxime showed higher growth rates than those exposed to the control medium probably due to larger presence of labile nutrients recent studies have shown that nutrients may induce an increase in the abundance of the inti1 gene in streambed biofilms under the combined effect of pharmaceutical compounds lehmann et al 2016 subirats et al 2018 these findings may provide a plausible explanation for the prevalence of inti1 gene in both biofilm and planktonic bacterial communities exposed to hqwr these results support the hypothesis that the inti1 gene is a suitable proxy for anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 even when bacterial communities are exposed to high quality wastewater that is considered safe for agricultural irrigation according to the italian law dm 185 2003 this is particularly worrisome since inti1 gene is usually linked to a several resistance genes and thus can favors the co selection of genes conferring resistance to antibiotics and metals seiler and berendonk 2012 in this regard our study also showed that hqwr may also favors the persistence of mrgs probably due to the presence of low concentration of metals suppl table s1 therefore if both the args and mrgs were located in a genetic platform that are usually integrated into plasmid such as a class 1 integrons it can also maintain and select antibiotics resistance in bacterial communities in the absence of antibiotics pal et al 2017 we also investigated the potential differences in adaptation between the planktonic and biofilm communities our results suggested that planktonic communities tend to be more sensitive to environmental pressure than those in biofilms the higher resistance of biofilm communities might be due to the intrinsic protection conferred by extracellular matrix of polysaccharides towards environmental hazards costerton et al 1978 despite the complex structure of the polysaccharide biofilm matrix allows bacteria to exhibit 10 to 100 times less susceptibility to antimicrobial compounds compared to planktonic bacterial cells gilbert et al 2002 it also provides a favorable environment for gene transfer gillings et al 2009 molin and tolker nielsen 2003 this feature among others has lead bacterial biofilms to be considered a suitable biosensor to evaluate the impact of long term anthropogenic pollution exposure on the prevalence of antibiotics resistance in surface waters balcázar et al 2015 subirats et al 2017 in aquatic ecosystems environmental factors play a critical role in shaping the composition of bacterial communities winter et al 2007 previous studies have shown that wastewater can modify the microbial communities in the receiving waters through both altering physicochemical characteristics of the habitat lu and lu 2014 saarenheimo et al 2017 and bringing in wastewater associated bacteria subirats et al 2017 herein we demonstrated that hqwr can also significantly change the composition of bacterial communities never exposed to direct anthropogenic pollution after 22 days of exposure to hqwr both planktonic and biofilm bacterial communities were enriched in members affiliated to acinetobacter and pseudomonas spp this result may be largely due to the difference on chemical characteristics of the dissolved organic matter dom present in the medium that fed the different treatments of our experiment the medium feeding bacterial communities in the control treatment was natural water from the mercurago lagoon italy that presents high proportion of refractory organic carbon consisting in high molecular weight and structural complex compounds e g humic acids and lignin the treated wastewater is rich in labile organic carbon fuentes rivas et al 2017 that favors growth efficiency church et al 2000 of bacteria especially those that are good competitors under selective pressures e g chemical stressors in wastewater such as acinetobacter and pseudomonas spp atrouni et al 2016 farvo 2017 moreover acinetobacter spp were favored by the addition of 5 μg l 1 of cefotaxime antibiotic in the hqwr suggesting that they may carry genes conferring resistance to cefotaxime other than those analyzed in the present study bla ctx m bla oxa and bla kpc indeed acinetobacter spp have been found to carry different genes conferring resistance to carbapenems such as bla vim bla imp and bla sim as well as to easily acquire resistance against aminoglycosides ampicillins tetracyclines gentamicin and tobramycin prashanth and badrinath 2005 unlike acinetobacter spp members within pseudomonas genus were sensitive to cefotaxime antibiotic since their relative abundance decreased in those samples exposed to hqwr ab treatment the enrichment of both acinetobacter and pseudomonas spp in those samples exposed to the hqwr is an important result since both genera encompass several multidrug resistant human pathogens largely related to nosocomial infections doughari et al 2011 farvo 2017 since the introduction of arb and args into the food chain through crop plants grown under reuse wastewater irrigated soil has been shown christou et al 2017 the use of wastewater for irrigation could lead to potential human health impacts 5 conclusions our work provides evidences that the presence of emerging contaminants and nutrient availability in hqwr can pose a large threat to the environment concretely this experiment demonstrated that reclaimed wastewater significantly contributed to increase both the resistance genes pool and the likelihood of gene transfer among bacteria population in aquatic environments besides hqwr favored the growth of acinetobacter and pseudomonas spp in both planktonic and biofilm communities both genus are known to encompass multidrug resistant opportunistic pathogens doughari et al 2011 farvo 2017 although there are still many knowledge gaps to properly define the risk of transmission of antibiotic resistance from the environment to humans the use of high quality treated wastewater for agricultural purposes may represent a direct threat to human health in this sense we highlight the need to carry out in situ real scale experiments and if needed to re define the suitability of reclaimed water parameters and to implement rigorous protocols for the safely use of reclaimed water to avoid undesired effects on the composition of microbial communities and the

18427,the recent emergence of second generation anticoagulant rodenticides ar in the aquatic environment emphasizes the relevance and impact of aquatic exposure pathways during rodent control pest control in municipal sewer systems of urban and suburban areas is thought to be an important emission pathway for ar to reach wastewater and municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp respectively to circumstantiate that ar will enter streams via effluent discharges and bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms despite very low predicted environmental emissions we conducted a retrospective biological monitoring of fish tissue samples from different wwtp fish monitoring ponds exclusively fed by municipal effluents in bavaria germany at the same time information about rodent control in associated sewer systems was collected by telephone survey to assess relationships between sewer baiting and rodenticide residues in fish in addition mussel and fish tissue samples from several bavarian surface waters with different effluent impact were analyzed to evaluate the prevalence of anticoagulants in indigenous aquatic organisms hepatic ar residues were detected at 12 out of 25 wwtp sampling sites in the low μg kg range thereof six sites with one or more second generation ar i e brodifacoum difenacoum bromadiolone 14 of 18 surveyed sites confirmed sewer baiting with ar and detected hepatic residues matched the reported active ingredients used for sewer baiting at six sites furthermore second generation ar were detected in more than 80 of fish liver samples from investigated bavarian streams highest total hepatic ar concentrations in these fish were 9 1 and 8 5 μg kg wet weight respectively and were observed at two riverine sampling sites characterized by close proximity to upstream wwtp outfalls no anticoagulant residues were found in fish liver samples from two lakes without known influences of effluent discharges the findings of our study clearly show incomplete removal of anticoagulants during conventional wastewater treatment and confirm exposure of aquatic organisms via municipal effluents based on the demonstrated temporal and spatial coherence between sewer baiting and hepatic ar residues in effluent exposed fish sewer baiting in combined sewer systems contributes to the release of active ingredients into the aquatic environment graphical abstract

of freshwater fish kotthoff et al 2018 emphasizes the relevance and impact of aquatic exposure pathways that had previously been underestimated regnery et al 2019 several studies hypothesized that pest control in and around municipal sewer systems by local authorities and commissioned pest control professionals is one important emission source of ar in urban and suburban settings gómez canela et al 2014a kotthoff et al 2018 in germany the annual domestic use of ar in sewer baiting scenarios was projected as approximately 600 metric tons of bait material and 50 kg of active ingredients respectively according to survey results from 2008 krüger and solas 2010 these quantities appear minor compared to sales volumes of common human or veterinary pharmaceuticals that are frequently detected in effluent impacted surface waters ashton et al 2004 thomas et al 2007 although ar bait formulations authorized for use in sewers mainly consist of wax or fat active ingredients are not chemically bound to the bait material and can be released upon disintegration of baits e g during prolonged exposure to moist or wet conditions from the sewers exposure of the aquatic environment most likely occurs via wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents or stormwater overflow structures in combined sewer systems that discharge highly diluted but untreated sewage directly into receiving surface waters when precipitation causes a surcharge within the system a spanish study reported sporadic occurrence of ar in wwtp samples in the low ng l and μg kg range respectively but failed in establishing meaningful input and elimination routes gómez canela et al 2014a 2014b gómez canela and lacorte 2016 despite shortcomings of their analytical approach regnery et al 2019 results pointed toward incomplete removal of ar during activated sludge treatment and potential discharges into receiving surface waters at trace level in laboratory tests all ar were shown to be hydrolytically stable in water under environmentally relevant conditions and were not readily biodegradable as summarized in regnery et al 2019 however a strong tendency to adsorb to organic matter combined with low water solubility and a high degree of photo instability suggest that second generation ar are unlikely to remain in the aqueous phase during conventional wastewater treatment their residues are more likely to persist and accumulate in organic rich sediments activated sludge suspended particulate matter and biosolids to date detailed information about the fate of anticoagulants other than warfarin during conventional or advanced wastewater treatment is lacking moreover multiple challenges of ar residue screening in aquatic environmental compartments were recently highlighted by regnery et al 2019 notably expected ar concentrations in wwtp effluent and receiving surface waters may be out of reach for current analytical methods and routine monitoring schemes according to worst case predicted environmental concentrations european chemicals agency 2018 regnery et al 2019 thus we initiated a retrospective biological monitoring to assess whether trace levels of ar will occur in tertiary treated wastewater effluents and thereby cause exposure of aquatic organisms in receiving streams we analyzed tissue samples of fish cyprinus carpio from 25 different wwtp fish monitoring ponds in bavaria germany that were provided by the bavarian environment agency these fish monitoring ponds are exclusively fed by tertiary treated municipal effluents and annually stocked with fish for six months to enable monitoring of trace level residual wastewater contaminants that might concentrate in aquatic organisms moreover information about rodent control in associated sewer systems shortly before or during the respective bioaccumulation period in these fish monitoring ponds was collected by telephone survey of municipal pest control officials at selected sites in 2018 to assess potential relationships between sewer baiting and ar residues in fish names and exact geographic locations of wwtp sampling sites in this study are nondisclosed to preserve individual privacy of

sampling sites with evidence of ar residues were surveyed in may 2018 to retrospectively obtain information about rodent control in associated sewer systems shortly before or during the 2015 bioaccumulation period of carp in respective bioaccumulation ponds furthermore 7 wwtp samplings sites without evidence of ar residues in fish were contacted surveyed information covered relevant wwtp operational parameters sewer system specifics applied pest control schemes within municipal purview i e mechanical or chemical frequency duration types of active ingredients bait amount and placement as well as other known or assumed sources of ar in the catchment area the narrow selection of surveyed sites as well as variable quality of mined data allowed for qualitative but not quantitative statistical analysis of survey results 3 results and discussion 3 1 residues of anticoagulants in fish from wastewater treatment plant bioaccumulation ponds although effluent dominated systems such as bioaccumulation ponds represent worst case exposure scenarios for fish they provide valuable insight regarding the bioaccumulation potential of effluent sourced contaminants in indigenous aquatic organisms at 12 out of 25 studied sampling sites ar residues were detected in the livers of individual carp in the low μg kg range after being exposed to municipal effluents for approximately six months no distinct correlation between ar concentration in fish and wwtp treatment capacity i e population equivalents was observed fig 1 a total of six sites revealed hepatic residues of one or more second generation ar due to the high frequency of non detect data i e less than values throughout the samples analyte detection frequencies median 95th percentile and maximum concentrations are listed in table 1 average biometric parameters of the analyzed two year old carp 14 male 8 female 10 undetermined were 35 7 3 7 cm total length 769 258 g whole body weight and 6 2 3 3 lipid content in liver tissue table s2 sm interestingly the first generation ar coumatetralyl was detected most frequently in carp from bioaccumulation ponds table 1 it was followed by the second generation ar bromadiolone brodifacoum and difenacoum all of which had higher detection limits than coumatetralyl table 1 notably multiple individuals from the same sampling site had matching distributions and comparable concentrations as shown for treatment facilities wwtp a b and c tables 2 and s2 sm pointing towards identical exposure of fish individuals via nondietary and or dietary routes in contrast difethialone was solely observed in one liver sample at wwtp b which was more likely due to individual dietary uptake rather than nondietary routes few studies hypothesized that terrestrial invertebrates feeding on ar containing bait may function as vector in the environment masuda et al 2014 pitt et al 2015 no residues of flocoumafen and chlorophacinone were detected in any of the analyzed samples from the bioaccumulation ponds tables 1 and 2 and no anticoagulant residues were detected in carp liver of a wastewater unexposed sibling that had been analyzed as a reference table s2 sm with the exemption of coumatetralyl none of the analyzed corresponding filet samples on average 0 9 0 5 lipid content contained anticoagulant residues table 2 at wwtp c traces of coumatetralyl were observed in filet samples of all three individuals the coumatetralyl residues in filet tissue were an indication for ongoing exposure at the time of sampling as active ingredient not yet bound to protein e g in the liver or blood plasma is expected to quickly depurate in fish based on laboratory bioconcentration studies eca 2016b in good agreement corresponding liver samples revealed substantial coumatetralyl residues table 2 wwtp c also exhibited highest hepatic concentration of total ar in a single organism 4 6 μg kg fig 1 in comparison lower hepatic concentrations of total ar 1 1 μg kg and fewer active ingredients were detected during the 2014 bioaccumulation period at site wwtp c while residues of difenacoum 1 0 μg kg bromadiolone 0 1 μg kg as well as phenprocoumon 0 36 μg kg were in the range of concentrations observed in liver samples of the 2015 bioaccumulation period table 2 no other ar residues were present this implies that even at the same site wastewater borne rodenticide emissions will vary over consecutive years due to variable usage patterns and multiple emission sources differences in the diversity of ar residues over time was recently reported by kotthoff et al 2018 for two riverine sampling sites based on decennial temporal trend analysis of fish liver samples that were obtained from the german specimen bank the presence of warfarin in wastewater has mainly been linked to the consumption of blood thinning medication by resident population as warfarin is the only biocidal anticoagulant that is concurrently authorized for pharmaceutical use ajo et al 2018 regnery et al 2019 santos et al 2013 to date the 4 hydroxycoumarin derivatives phenprocoumon and acenocoumarol are primarily used across continental europe instead of warfarin to prevent and treat thromboembolic diseases besides direct coagulation factor inhibitor drugs fan et al 2018 lin et al 2013 medical consumption of phenprocoumon exceeds that of warfarin by approximately factor 40 according to german prescription statistics regnery et al 2019 congruently hepatic residues of phenprocoumon were detected in 76 9 of carp from bioaccumulation ponds with a maximum level of 1 8 μg kg whereas hepatic warfarin residues were only observed at trace level in less than 10 of samples with a maximum of 0 05 μg kg table 1 the more pronounced hepatic phenprocoumon residues in effluent exposed fish can be explained by the higher frequency and amplitude of contaminant loading considering that both substances are extensively metabolized in the human body only about 2 of the typical daily warfarin prescription dose is excreted as unchanged active ingredient crouse et al 2012 park 1988 phenprocoumon is excreted almost entirely as a glucuronide conjugate with less than 10 of the dose as unchanged drug kasprzyk hordern 2010 data summarized in table 1 fig 1 and table s5 corroborate the assumption that ar input rates are of transient character and will fluctuate depending on site specific factors such as usage patterns and runoff regimes in urban and suburban catchments hydro meteorological conditions and wwtp operational parameters and performance all of the investigated municipal wwtp in this study applied tertiary treatment i e each treatment train consisted of mechanical treatment followed by biological treatment stages and chemical dosing for enhanced nutrient removal treatment capacities varied between 100 000 and 2 000 000 population equivalents bayerisches landesamt für umwelt 2012b with average daily dry weather effluent discharges in the range of 5000 to 570 240 m3 d table s5 sm yet discharges could quadruplicate during wet weather at facilities with mainly combined sewer systems connected majority of investigated sites none of the treatment facilities with confirmed second generation ar residues in fish wwtp a f table s5 sm applied further advanced treatment downstream advanced treatment stages that are focused on elimination of refractory wastewater borne trace organic chemicals such as ozone advanced oxidation processes membrane filtration or activated carbon filtration are still not common at full scale facilities in germany schaar and kreuzinger 2017 nevertheless several neighboring wwtp sites discharging into the same stream i e along the upper and middle stretch of isar river operate downstream biological active sand filters table s5 sm although some of these facilities also run ultra violet uv disinfection units during bathing season to meet microbial bathing water quality requirements effluents feeding the bioaccumulation ponds had been diverted prior to disinfection according to personal communication with wwtp operators while no second generation ar residues were detected in fish samples from sampling sites with further advanced treatment e g wwtp n o r and s low levels of hepatic phenprocoumon residues were frequently observed indicating incomplete retention of this hydroxycoumarin derivative in biological active sand filters given their aforementioned physicochemical properties e g not readily biodegradable low water solubility high lipophilicity and photolytic instability at ambient environmental conditions second generation ar might occur particle bound in wastewater effluents rather than freely dissolved although a previous study implied enhanced solubility or co solubility of second generation ar in organic rich water pitt et al 2015 depending on the treatment train of investigated facilities remaining suspended particle loads in the discharged effluents were generally in the range of 2 10 mg l under dry weather conditions table s5 sm a previous investigation observed no relationship between fish length total weight and wwtp treatment capacity whereas factors such as pond size and type were identified as major driver for fish condition in the bioaccumulation ponds bayerisches landesamt für umwelt 2012b yet site specific distributions of ar were further evaluated based on available physiological fish health parameters e g length weight lipid content organ weight and are shown as a function of fulton s cf and hsi in fig 2 overall occurrence and distribution of ar residues expressed no distinct relationship with gender lipid content and physiological parameters of fish health such as cf or hsi fulton s cf for carp should generally be higher than 1 to indicate adequate nutritional state values for cf and hsi were on average 1 6 0 2 and 2 8 0 8 respectively table s2 sm teubner et al 2015 concluded earlier that fulton s cf and hsi might be no meaningful stress indicators nevertheless adverse effects of chronic ar exposure in fish from these bioaccumulation ponds could have been masked by other stressors or influential factors that we were not able to account for in retrospect at the investigated 25 wwtp in summary our results provide crucial evidence that anticoagulants are not completely removed during conventional biological wastewater treatment and thus confirm one important exposure pathway for indigenous aquatic organisms anticoagulants will enter the aquatic environment by way of effluent discharges furthermore these findings also show that second generation ar can bioaccumulate in fish liver under environmentally realistic conditions and exposure scenarios 3 2 potential sources of anticoagulant rodenticides in wastewater considering anticoagulants high protein binding capacity and the persistence of specifically second generation ar in liver tissues of terrestrial wildlife horak et al 2018 it is difficult to link hepatic ar residues in fish to distinct exposure events besides the aforementioned release of pharmaceutical anticoagulants e g phenprocoumon warfarin due to medical consumption pest control in and around municipal sewer systems in urban and suburban settings is assumed to be the major emission source of ar into wastewater notably 78 of operators and administrators at the 18 surveyed sampling sites confirmed sewer baiting with ar whereas 17 negated pest control enforcement in their sewers in 2015 table s5 sm one municipality used a mechanical rat trap system based on available information mainly bait blocks were used when baiting with ar in general baits were attached to the manhole s gully trap or step irons by wire to prevent dragging off or flushing away at most surveyed sites however deployed baits remained in the sewers after baiting campaigns ended and were not removed for disposal individual annual quantities deployed in the sewers ranged between 500 and 2500 baits mostly 200 g bait blocks among the 11 municipalities that provided quantitative information table s5 sm this corresponded to a total of approximately 3000 kg of bait material per 2 500 000 person equivalents at all surveyed sites products containing difenacoum warfarin bromadiolone or brodifacoum were exclusively used table s5 sm oftentimes multiple products with different active ingredients were applied over the course of one control measure based on provided information by municipal pest control officials detected ar residues in fish liver matched the reported active ingredients used for sewer baiting at six sampling sites fig 3 namely at wwtp a b d e i and k table s5 sm interestingly traces of warfarin residues in carp from wwtp d i and k concurred with confirmed deployment of warfarin baits during sewer baiting in the associated sewer systems despite the demonstrated temporal and spatial coherence evidence of specific emission sources and pathways remains challenging considering their wide application range while existing data suggest that pest control professionals are among the main users of biocidal ar in germany agribusinesses local authorities and household consumers represent other important user groups regnery et al 2019 for instance the second generation ar detected in fish liver at wwtp f did not match the second generation ar supposedly used for sewer baiting by its largest connected municipality fig 3 and table s5 sm it became apparent that wwtp f received wastewater from 11 additional communities which were not part of the survey thus the proportional dry weather discharge of the surveyed municipality was only in the range of approximately 30 moreover at least four surveyed sites with confirmed second generation ar sewer baiting in 2015 revealed no corresponding residues in fish at two sites thereof i e wwtp g and j municipal pest control officials reported that untouched bait blocks had been removed from the sewers for appropriate disposal at the end of their baiting campaigns in both samples solely traces of hepatic coumatetralyl residues were found in germany none of the registered products containing coumatetralyl are permitted for use in sewer baiting scenarios however the use of first generation ar such as coumatetralyl is less restricted information provided by german stakeholder groups and a recent study by koivisto et al 2018 suggest that coumatetralyl is more frequently used by agribusinesses and private consumers rather than pest control professionals or municipalities it can be concluded that sewer baiting contributes to the release of active ingredients into wastewater baits deployed in combined sewer systems and stormwater channels face a substantial risk of prolonged exposure to moist or wet conditions and thus scouring when precipitation causes a sudden surcharge within the system due to frequently occurring extreme weather events such as torrential downpours in urban and suburban areas this is even more critical for the application of ar containing baits in stormwater channels that are not connected to retention basins or wwtp but discharge directly into natural water bodies nonetheless the risk of active ingredient release during chemical pest control measures in sewer systems can be minimized if contact of bait material with water and wastewater is strictly excluded e g by use of devices that keep the bait dry deployment of baits exclusively in manholes free from backing up runoff pouring in collection and appropriate disposal of remaining bait at the end of baiting campaigns besides sewer baiting additional emission sources of ar into sewer systems and wwtp are surmised and require further investigation potential other emission scenarios include baits or poisoned carcasses being flushed into the sewers during outdoor surface baiting e g near storage facilities for goods or food production public green space private or communal garden plots incorrect disposal of baits landfill leachate recirculate from sludge dewatering processes or washing of disposed organic material containing active ingredients prior incineration deployment of baits in the immediate vicinity of watercourses represents another likely emission source of ar into the aquatic environment e g due to wash off from bank slopes aboveground bait stations or rodent burrows respectively as well as contaminated run off european chemicals agency 2018 although mandatory instructions for use and risk mitigation measures were stipulated at eu level and best practice guidelines were established during national product authorizations to minimize the risks of environmental exposure umweltbundesamt 2019 the extent of compliance with these provisions and guidelines is largely unknown previous studies assumed that the typical use of ar commonly violates respective use and disposal instructions koivisto et al 2016 it should be noted that anticoagulants are currently not approved as active ingredients in plant protection products in germany operators at wwtp c confirmed that no sewer baiting with ar had been conducted in their associated combined sewer system over the past 10 years table s5 sm yet wwtp c was the site with the highest number and total concentration of ar residues i e brodifacoum bromadiolone difenacoum and coumatetralyl among the 2015 carp liver samples furthermore bromadiolone and difenacoum were also detected in carp liver from the same site in 2014 as discussed earlier 3 3 occurrence and fate of anticoagulants in fish and mussels from lakes and receiving streams prolonged input rates of anticoagulants from effluent loadings even at trace level can increase the effective exposure duration of organisms residing in receiving aquatic systems if input rates exceed environmental dissipation rates in most upper river basins in germany wastewater effluent contributions during average flow conditions vary between 0 and 5 according to a recent study by karakurt et al 2019 contributions of more than 5 10 and more than 10 20 respectively are prevalent in river basins up and downstream of urban centers as well as river stretches generally characterized by low flow conditions e g main river during low flow conditions however effluent contributions of more than 10 20 are common for a large number of river basins nationwide whereas several water sheds exhibit wastewater effluent contributions of more than 20 30 karakurt et al 2019 as expected based on available information about their environmental fate and minor medical consumption in germany warfarin and acenocoumarol were not detected in any of the biological tissue samples from wild freshwater fish table 1 while phenprocoumon traces were detected in 83 3 of fish samples from receiving streams its median concentration in liver tissue was only 0 04 μg kg with a maximum of 0 2 μg kg table 1 corroborating marginal bioaccumulation potential in indigenous aquatic organisms in contrast a 40 fold higher median concentration of brodifacoum was observed in these liver tissue samples overall residues of second generation ar were detected in more than 80 of fish liver samples mainly chub 4 11 years from investigated bavarian streams with different degrees of municipal effluent contributions fig 4 residues were detected in individuals from amper n 1 approx 0 5 wastewater effluent contribution during average flow conditions at this sampling site iller n 1 approx 0 5 isar n 2 approx 5 10 at both sites lech n 1 approx 0 5 and main n 5 approx 9 11 throughout sites whereas no residues were observed in two individuals from sampling sites at danube approx 5 10 and vils approx 0 5 respectively as summarized in table 1 brodifacoum 66 7 was most frequently detected followed by bromadiolone 41 7 difenacoum 25 flocoumafen 25 and difethialone 25 the high detection frequency of hepatic brodifacoum residues in our study concurs with findings by kotthoff et al 2018 in 8 12 year old limnic bream likewise no anticoagulant residues were found in liver samples of pike from two lakes i e starnberger see and weiβensee without known influences of effluent discharges fig 4 the highest total ar concentrations were in the range of 9 1 and 8 5 μg kg and were observed in an 8 year old chub from the lower stretch of isar near its confluence with danube and an 11 year old from main near rothwind fig 4 and table s1 both sampling sites are characterized by close proximity to upstream wwtp outfalls according to their technical data sheets accessed on 01 18

flocoumafen residue 0 1 μg kg were detected this sampling site is situated downstream of several wwtp sampling site outfalls with non detects of ar in effluent exposed carp as discussed in section 3 1 at main river all five individuals from four different sampling sites along its upper and middle stretch table s1 and fig s1 sm revealed hepatic residues of at least one second generation ar their total ar concentrations ranged between 1 3 and 8 5 μg kg fig 4 it was estimated that portions of main receive effluent contributions of more than 30 50 under low water conditions karakurt et al 2019 analyzed corresponding filet samples of three individuals from main river revealed no residues table s1 sm interestingly no ar residues were detected above their respective method detection limits in pooled mussel samples from two main sampling sites thereof one site with confirmed hepatic ar residues in fish fig s1 and table s1 sm as reported in previous studies bioaccumulation processes can widely differ among aquatic species due to complex interactions between various routes of uptake excretion passive release and metabolization streit 1998 furthermore substantial data gaps exist regarding the understanding of exposure pathways and potential adverse effects of chronic exposure with multiple active ingredients rattner et al 2014 making it nearly impossible at the moment to estimate the consequences of chronic ar exposure to freshwater fish nonetheless very persistent second generation ar such as brodifacoum will likely accumulate in the aquatic food chain when released into the aquatic environment and put predators at risk ruiz suarez et al 2016 serieys et al 2019 4 conclusions our results clearly indicate incomplete removal of ar during conventional wastewater treatment and confirm indirect exposure of aquatic organisms via wwtp effluents our findings also confirm high hepatic bioaccumulation potential and persistence of second generation ar in indigenous limnic fish based on the demonstrated temporal and spatial coherence between sewer baiting and hepatic anticoagulant residues in effluent exposed fish sewer baiting in combined sewer systems contributes to the release of active ingredients into raw wastewater and receiving streams respectively nevertheless realistic exposure estimations for the aquatic environment remain challenging given the non disclosure or non existence of domestic market data on rodenticide sales use and disposal future research should focus on identifying the ecotoxicological consequences of chronic rodenticide

18427,the recent emergence of second generation anticoagulant rodenticides ar in the aquatic environment emphasizes the relevance and impact of aquatic exposure pathways during rodent control pest control in municipal sewer systems of urban and suburban areas is thought to be an important emission pathway for ar to reach wastewater and municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp respectively to circumstantiate that ar will enter streams via effluent discharges and bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms despite very low predicted environmental emissions we conducted a retrospective biological monitoring of fish tissue samples from different wwtp fish monitoring ponds exclusively fed by municipal effluents in bavaria germany at the same time information about rodent control in associated sewer systems was collected by telephone survey to assess relationships between sewer baiting and rodenticide residues in fish in addition mussel and fish tissue samples from several bavarian surface waters with different effluent impact were analyzed to evaluate the prevalence of anticoagulants in indigenous aquatic organisms hepatic ar residues were detected at 12 out of 25 wwtp sampling sites in the low μg kg range thereof six sites with one or more second generation ar i e brodifacoum difenacoum bromadiolone 14 of 18 surveyed sites confirmed sewer baiting with ar and detected hepatic residues matched the reported active ingredients used for sewer baiting at six sites furthermore second generation ar were detected in more than 80 of fish liver samples from investigated bavarian streams highest total hepatic ar concentrations in these fish were 9 1 and 8 5 μg kg wet weight respectively and were observed at two riverine sampling sites characterized by close proximity to upstream wwtp outfalls no anticoagulant residues were found in fish liver samples from two lakes without known influences of effluent discharges the findings of our study clearly show incomplete removal of anticoagulants during conventional wastewater treatment and confirm exposure of aquatic organisms via municipal effluents based on the demonstrated temporal and spatial coherence between sewer baiting and hepatic ar residues in effluent exposed fish sewer baiting in combined sewer systems contributes to the release of active ingredients into the aquatic environment graphical abstract

hygienic and public health reasons buckle and smith 2015 eight anticoagulants are currently approved in the european union eu for biocidal use under the eu biocidal products regulation no 528 2012 european union 2012 thereof three first generation anticoagulants with maximum permissible concentrations of 0 079 warfarin 0 0375 coumatetralyl and 0 005 chlorophacinone and five second generation ar with maximum permissible concentrations of 0 0075 difenacoum 0 005 bromadiolone brodifacoum flocoumafen and 0 0025 difethialone of active ingredient in bait formulations respectively in recent years eu wide application of second generation ar has been increasingly restrained because of human and environmental risks and their classification as persistent bioaccumulative and toxic substances regnery et al 2019 van den brink et al 2018 until lately however risk mitigation measures during rodent control focused almost exclusively on the terrestrial environment berny et al 2014 despite considerable acute toxicity of several ar to aquatic species as summarized in regnery et al 2019 lc50 values i e lethal ar concentration for 50 of test subjects after 96 h of exposure for rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss are in the range of 40 μg l brodifacoum 51 μg l difethialone 65 μg l difenacoum 70 μg l flocoumafen and 2860 μg l bromadiolone furthermore brodifacoum difethialone and flocoumafen exhibit very high bioaccumulation potential in fish eca 2016a c d the recent emergence of ar residues in the aquatic environment amongst others their widespread occurrence in liver tissue of freshwater fish kotthoff et al 2018 emphasizes the relevance and impact of aquatic exposure pathways that had previously been underestimated regnery et al 2019 several studies hypothesized that pest control in and around municipal sewer systems by local authorities and commissioned pest control professionals is one important emission source of ar in urban and suburban settings gómez canela et al 2014a kotthoff et al 2018 in germany the annual domestic use of ar in sewer baiting scenarios was projected as approximately 600 metric tons of bait material and 50 kg of active ingredients respectively according to survey results from 2008 krüger and solas 2010 these quantities appear minor compared to sales volumes of common human or veterinary pharmaceuticals that are frequently detected in effluent impacted surface waters ashton et al 2004 thomas et al 2007 although ar bait formulations authorized for use in sewers mainly consist of wax or fat active ingredients are not chemically bound to the bait material and can be released upon disintegration of baits e g during prolonged exposure to moist or wet conditions from the sewers exposure of the aquatic environment most likely occurs via wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents or stormwater overflow structures in combined sewer systems that discharge highly diluted but untreated sewage directly into receiving surface waters when precipitation causes a surcharge within the system a spanish study reported sporadic occurrence of ar in wwtp samples in the low ng l and μg kg range respectively but failed in establishing meaningful input and elimination routes gómez canela et al 2014a 2014b gómez canela and lacorte 2016 despite shortcomings of their analytical approach regnery et al 2019 results pointed toward incomplete removal of ar during activated sludge treatment and potential discharges into receiving surface waters at trace level in laboratory tests all ar were shown to be hydrolytically stable in water under environmentally relevant conditions and were not readily biodegradable as summarized in regnery et al 2019 however a strong tendency to adsorb to organic matter combined with low water solubility and a high degree of photo instability suggest that second generation ar are unlikely to remain in the aqueous phase during conventional wastewater treatment their residues are more likely to persist and accumulate in organic rich sediments activated sludge suspended particulate matter and biosolids to date detailed information about the fate of anticoagulants other than warfarin during conventional or advanced wastewater treatment is lacking moreover multiple challenges of ar residue screening in aquatic environmental compartments were recently highlighted by regnery et al 2019 notably expected ar concentrations in wwtp effluent and receiving surface waters may be out of reach for current analytical methods and routine monitoring schemes according to worst case predicted environmental concentrations european chemicals agency 2018 regnery et al 2019 thus we initiated a retrospective biological monitoring to assess whether trace levels of ar will occur in tertiary treated wastewater effluents and thereby cause exposure of aquatic organisms in receiving streams we analyzed tissue samples of fish cyprinus carpio from 25 different wwtp fish monitoring ponds in bavaria germany that were provided by the bavarian environment agency these fish monitoring ponds are exclusively fed by tertiary treated municipal effluents and annually stocked with fish for six months to enable monitoring of trace level residual wastewater contaminants that might concentrate in aquatic organisms moreover information about rodent control in associated sewer systems shortly before or during the respective bioaccumulation period in these fish monitoring ponds was collected by telephone survey of municipal pest control officials at selected sites in 2018 to assess potential relationships between sewer baiting and ar residues in fish names and exact geographic locations of wwtp sampling sites in this study are nondisclosed to preserve individual privacy of investigated wwtp and associated municipalities to further evaluate the occurrence of anticoagulants in indigenous aquatic organisms as a function of wastewater effluent discharges mussel and fish tissue samples from seven bavarian streams with different degrees of municipal effluent contribution as well as two lakes without effluent discharges were also provided by the bavarian environment

sampling sites with evidence of ar residues were surveyed in may 2018 to retrospectively obtain information about rodent control in associated sewer systems shortly before or during the 2015 bioaccumulation period of carp in respective bioaccumulation ponds furthermore 7 wwtp samplings sites without evidence of ar residues in fish were contacted surveyed information covered relevant wwtp operational parameters sewer system specifics applied pest control schemes within municipal purview i e mechanical or chemical frequency duration types of active ingredients bait amount and placement as well as other known or assumed sources of ar in the catchment area the narrow selection of surveyed sites as well as variable quality of mined data allowed for qualitative but not quantitative statistical analysis of survey results 3 results and discussion 3 1 residues of anticoagulants in fish from wastewater treatment plant bioaccumulation ponds although effluent dominated systems such as bioaccumulation ponds represent worst case exposure scenarios for fish they provide valuable insight regarding the bioaccumulation potential of effluent sourced contaminants in indigenous aquatic organisms at 12 out of 25 studied sampling sites ar residues were detected in the livers of individual carp in the low μg kg range after being exposed to municipal effluents for approximately six months no distinct correlation between ar concentration in fish and wwtp treatment capacity i e population equivalents was observed fig 1 a total of six sites revealed hepatic residues of one or more second generation ar due to the high frequency of non detect data i e less than values throughout the samples analyte detection frequencies median 95th percentile and maximum concentrations are listed in table 1 average biometric parameters of the analyzed two year old carp 14 male 8 female 10 undetermined were 35 7 3 7 cm total length 769 258 g whole body weight and 6 2 3 3 lipid content in liver tissue table s2 sm interestingly the first generation ar coumatetralyl was detected most frequently in carp from bioaccumulation ponds table 1 it was followed by the second generation ar bromadiolone brodifacoum and difenacoum all of which had higher detection limits than coumatetralyl table 1 notably multiple individuals from the same sampling site had matching distributions and comparable concentrations as shown for treatment facilities wwtp a b and c tables 2 and s2 sm pointing towards identical exposure of fish individuals via nondietary and or dietary routes in contrast difethialone was solely observed in one liver sample at wwtp b which was more likely due to individual dietary uptake rather than nondietary routes few studies hypothesized that terrestrial invertebrates feeding on ar containing bait may function as vector in the environment masuda et al 2014 pitt et al 2015 no residues of flocoumafen and chlorophacinone were detected in any of the analyzed samples from the bioaccumulation ponds tables 1 and 2 and no anticoagulant residues were detected in carp liver of a wastewater unexposed sibling that had been analyzed as a reference table s2 sm with the exemption of coumatetralyl none of the analyzed corresponding filet samples on average 0 9 0 5 lipid content contained anticoagulant residues table 2 at wwtp c traces of coumatetralyl were observed in filet samples of all three individuals the coumatetralyl residues in filet tissue were an indication for ongoing exposure at the time of sampling as active ingredient not yet bound to protein e g in the liver or blood plasma is expected to quickly depurate in fish based on laboratory bioconcentration studies eca 2016b in good agreement corresponding liver samples revealed substantial coumatetralyl residues table 2 wwtp c also exhibited highest hepatic concentration of total ar in a single organism 4 6 μg kg fig 1 in comparison lower hepatic concentrations of total ar 1 1 μg kg and fewer active ingredients were detected during the 2014 bioaccumulation period at site wwtp c while residues of difenacoum 1 0 μg kg bromadiolone 0 1 μg kg as well as phenprocoumon 0 36 μg kg were in the range of concentrations observed in liver samples of the 2015 bioaccumulation period table 2 no other ar residues were present this implies that even at the same site wastewater borne rodenticide emissions will vary over consecutive years due to variable usage patterns and multiple emission sources differences in the diversity of ar residues over time was recently reported by kotthoff et al 2018 for two riverine sampling sites based on decennial temporal trend analysis of fish liver samples that were obtained from the german specimen bank the presence of warfarin in wastewater has mainly been linked to the consumption of blood thinning medication by resident population as warfarin is the only biocidal anticoagulant that is concurrently authorized for pharmaceutical use ajo et al 2018 regnery et al 2019 santos et al 2013 to date the 4 hydroxycoumarin derivatives phenprocoumon and acenocoumarol are primarily used across continental europe instead of warfarin to prevent and treat thromboembolic diseases besides direct coagulation factor inhibitor drugs fan et al 2018 lin et al 2013 medical consumption of phenprocoumon exceeds that of warfarin by approximately factor 40 according to german prescription statistics regnery et al 2019 congruently hepatic residues of phenprocoumon were detected in 76 9 of carp from bioaccumulation ponds with a maximum level of 1 8 μg kg whereas hepatic warfarin residues were only observed at trace level in less than 10 of samples with a maximum of 0 05 μg kg table 1 the more pronounced hepatic phenprocoumon residues in effluent exposed fish can be explained by the higher frequency and amplitude of contaminant loading considering that both substances are extensively metabolized in the human body only about 2 of the typical daily warfarin prescription dose is excreted as unchanged active ingredient crouse et al 2012 park 1988 phenprocoumon is excreted almost entirely as a glucuronide conjugate with less than 10 of the dose as unchanged drug kasprzyk hordern 2010 data summarized in table 1 fig 1 and table s5 corroborate the assumption that ar input rates are of transient character and will fluctuate depending on site specific factors such as usage patterns and runoff regimes in urban and suburban catchments hydro meteorological conditions and wwtp operational parameters and performance all of the investigated municipal wwtp in this study applied tertiary treatment i e each treatment train consisted of mechanical treatment followed by biological treatment stages and chemical dosing for enhanced nutrient removal treatment capacities varied between 100 000 and 2 000 000 population equivalents bayerisches landesamt für umwelt 2012b with average daily dry weather effluent discharges in the range of 5000 to 570 240 m3 d table s5 sm yet discharges could quadruplicate during wet weather at facilities with mainly combined sewer systems connected majority of investigated sites none of the treatment facilities with confirmed second generation ar residues in fish wwtp a f table s5 sm applied further advanced treatment downstream advanced treatment stages that are focused on elimination of refractory wastewater borne trace organic chemicals such as ozone advanced oxidation processes membrane filtration or activated carbon filtration are still not common at full scale facilities in germany schaar and kreuzinger 2017 nevertheless several neighboring wwtp sites discharging into the same stream i e along the upper and middle stretch of isar river operate downstream biological active sand filters table s5 sm although some of these facilities also run ultra violet uv disinfection units during bathing season to meet microbial bathing water quality requirements effluents feeding the bioaccumulation ponds had been diverted prior to disinfection according to personal communication with wwtp operators while no second generation ar residues were detected in fish samples from sampling sites with further advanced treatment e g wwtp n o r and s low levels of hepatic phenprocoumon residues were frequently observed indicating incomplete retention of this hydroxycoumarin derivative in biological active sand filters given their aforementioned physicochemical properties e g not readily biodegradable low water solubility high lipophilicity and photolytic instability at ambient environmental conditions second generation ar might occur particle bound in wastewater effluents rather than freely dissolved although a previous study implied enhanced solubility or co solubility of second generation ar in organic rich water pitt et al 2015 depending on the treatment train of investigated facilities remaining suspended particle loads in the discharged effluents were generally in the range of 2 10 mg l under dry weather conditions table s5 sm a previous investigation observed no relationship between fish length total weight and wwtp treatment capacity whereas factors such as pond size and type were identified as major driver for fish condition in the bioaccumulation ponds bayerisches landesamt für umwelt 2012b yet site specific distributions of ar were further evaluated based on available physiological fish health parameters e g length weight lipid content organ weight and are shown as a function of fulton s cf and hsi in fig 2 overall occurrence and distribution of ar residues expressed no distinct relationship with gender lipid content and physiological parameters of fish health such as cf or hsi fulton s cf for carp should generally be higher than 1 to indicate adequate nutritional state values for cf and hsi were on average 1 6 0 2 and 2 8 0 8 respectively table s2 sm teubner et al 2015 concluded earlier that fulton s cf and hsi might be no meaningful stress indicators nevertheless adverse effects of chronic ar exposure in fish from these bioaccumulation ponds could have been masked by other stressors or influential factors that we were not able to account for in retrospect at the investigated 25 wwtp in summary our results provide crucial evidence that anticoagulants are not completely removed during conventional biological wastewater treatment and thus confirm one important exposure pathway for indigenous aquatic organisms anticoagulants will enter the aquatic environment by way of effluent discharges furthermore these findings also show that second generation ar can bioaccumulate in fish liver under environmentally realistic conditions and exposure scenarios 3 2 potential sources of anticoagulant rodenticides in wastewater considering anticoagulants high protein binding capacity and the persistence of specifically second generation ar in liver tissues of terrestrial wildlife horak et al 2018 it is difficult to link hepatic ar residues in fish to distinct exposure events besides the aforementioned release of pharmaceutical anticoagulants e g phenprocoumon warfarin due to medical consumption pest control in and around municipal sewer systems in urban and suburban settings is assumed to be the major emission source of ar into wastewater notably 78 of operators and administrators at the 18 surveyed sampling sites confirmed sewer baiting with ar whereas 17 negated pest control enforcement in their sewers in 2015 table s5 sm one municipality used a mechanical rat trap system based on available information mainly bait blocks were used when baiting with ar in general baits were attached to the manhole s gully trap or step irons by wire to prevent dragging off or flushing away at most surveyed sites however deployed baits remained in the sewers after baiting campaigns ended and were not removed for disposal individual annual quantities deployed in the sewers ranged between 500 and 2500 baits mostly 200 g bait blocks among the 11 municipalities that provided quantitative information table s5 sm this corresponded to a total of approximately 3000 kg of bait material per 2 500 000 person equivalents at all surveyed sites products containing difenacoum warfarin bromadiolone or brodifacoum were exclusively used table s5 sm oftentimes multiple products with different active ingredients were applied over the course of one control measure based on provided information by municipal pest control officials detected ar residues in fish liver matched the reported active ingredients used for sewer baiting at six sampling sites fig 3 namely at wwtp a b d e i and k table s5 sm interestingly traces of warfarin residues in carp from wwtp d i and k concurred with confirmed deployment of warfarin baits during sewer baiting in the associated sewer systems despite the demonstrated temporal and spatial coherence evidence of specific emission sources and pathways remains challenging considering their wide application range while existing data suggest that pest control professionals are among the main users of biocidal ar in germany agribusinesses local authorities and household consumers represent other important user groups regnery et al 2019 for instance the second generation ar detected in fish liver at wwtp f did not match the second generation ar supposedly used for sewer baiting by its largest connected municipality fig 3 and table s5 sm it became apparent that wwtp f received wastewater from 11 additional communities which were not part of the survey thus the proportional dry weather discharge of the surveyed municipality was only in the range of approximately 30 moreover at least four surveyed sites with confirmed second generation ar sewer baiting in 2015 revealed no corresponding residues in fish at two sites thereof i e wwtp g and j municipal pest control officials reported that untouched bait blocks had been removed from the sewers for appropriate disposal at the end of their baiting campaigns in both samples solely traces of hepatic coumatetralyl residues were found in germany none of the registered products containing coumatetralyl are permitted for use in sewer baiting scenarios however the use of first generation ar such as coumatetralyl is less restricted information provided by german stakeholder groups and a recent study by koivisto et al 2018 suggest that coumatetralyl is more frequently used by agribusinesses and private consumers rather than pest control professionals or municipalities it can be concluded that sewer baiting contributes to the release of active ingredients into wastewater baits deployed in combined sewer systems and stormwater channels face a substantial risk of prolonged exposure to moist or wet conditions and thus scouring when precipitation causes a sudden surcharge within the system due to frequently occurring extreme weather events such as torrential downpours in urban and suburban areas this is even more critical for the application of ar containing baits in stormwater channels that are not connected to retention basins or wwtp but discharge directly into natural water bodies nonetheless the risk of active ingredient release during chemical pest control measures in sewer systems can be minimized if contact of bait material with water and wastewater is strictly excluded e g by use of devices that keep the bait dry deployment of baits exclusively in manholes free from backing up runoff pouring in collection and appropriate disposal of remaining bait at the end of baiting campaigns besides sewer baiting additional emission sources of ar into sewer systems and wwtp are surmised and require further investigation potential other emission scenarios include baits or poisoned carcasses being flushed into the sewers during outdoor surface baiting e g near storage facilities for goods or food production public green space private or communal garden plots incorrect disposal of baits landfill leachate recirculate from sludge dewatering processes or washing of disposed organic material containing active ingredients prior incineration deployment of baits in the immediate vicinity of watercourses represents another likely emission source of ar into the aquatic environment e g due to wash off from bank slopes aboveground bait stations or rodent burrows respectively as well as contaminated run off european chemicals agency 2018 although mandatory instructions for use and risk mitigation measures were stipulated at eu level and best practice guidelines were established during national product authorizations to minimize the risks of environmental exposure umweltbundesamt 2019 the extent of compliance with these provisions and guidelines is largely unknown previous studies assumed that the typical use of ar commonly violates respective use and disposal instructions koivisto et al 2016 it should be noted that anticoagulants are currently not approved as active ingredients in plant protection products in germany operators at wwtp c confirmed that no sewer baiting with ar had been conducted in their associated combined sewer system over the past 10 years table s5 sm yet wwtp c was the site with the highest number and total concentration of ar residues i e brodifacoum bromadiolone difenacoum and coumatetralyl among the 2015 carp liver samples furthermore bromadiolone and difenacoum were also detected in carp liver from the same site in 2014 as discussed earlier 3 3 occurrence and fate of anticoagulants in fish and mussels from lakes and receiving streams prolonged input rates of anticoagulants from effluent loadings even at trace level can increase the effective exposure duration of organisms residing in receiving aquatic systems if input rates exceed environmental dissipation rates in most upper river basins in germany wastewater effluent contributions during average flow conditions vary between 0 and 5 according to a recent study by karakurt et al 2019 contributions of more than 5 10 and more than 10 20 respectively are prevalent in river basins up and downstream of urban centers as well as river stretches generally characterized by low flow conditions e g main river during low flow conditions however effluent contributions of more than 10 20 are common for a large number of river basins nationwide whereas several water sheds exhibit wastewater effluent contributions of more than 20 30 karakurt et al 2019 as expected based on available information about their environmental fate and minor medical consumption in germany warfarin and acenocoumarol were not detected in any of the biological tissue samples from wild freshwater fish table 1 while phenprocoumon traces were detected in 83 3 of fish samples from receiving streams its median concentration in liver tissue was only 0 04 μg kg with a maximum of 0 2 μg kg table 1 corroborating marginal bioaccumulation potential in indigenous aquatic organisms in contrast a 40 fold higher median concentration of brodifacoum was observed in these liver tissue samples overall residues of second generation ar were detected in more than 80 of fish liver samples mainly chub 4 11 years from investigated bavarian streams with different degrees of municipal effluent contributions fig 4 residues were detected in individuals from amper n 1 approx 0 5 wastewater effluent contribution during average flow conditions at this sampling site iller n 1 approx 0 5 isar n 2 approx 5 10 at both sites lech n 1 approx 0 5 and main n 5 approx 9 11 throughout sites whereas no residues were observed in two individuals from sampling sites at danube approx 5 10 and vils approx 0 5 respectively as summarized in table 1 brodifacoum 66 7 was most frequently detected followed by bromadiolone 41 7 difenacoum 25 flocoumafen 25 and difethialone 25 the high detection frequency of hepatic brodifacoum residues in our study concurs with findings by kotthoff et al 2018 in 8 12 year old limnic bream likewise no anticoagulant residues were found in liver samples of pike from two lakes i e starnberger see and weiβensee without known influences of effluent discharges fig 4 the highest total ar concentrations were in the range of 9 1 and 8 5 μg kg and were observed in an 8 year old chub from the lower stretch of isar near its confluence with danube and an 11 year old from main near rothwind fig 4 and table s1 both sampling sites are characterized by close proximity to upstream wwtp outfalls according to their technical data sheets accessed on 01 18

flocoumafen residue 0 1 μg kg were detected this sampling site is situated downstream of several wwtp sampling site outfalls with non detects of ar in effluent exposed carp as discussed in section 3 1 at main river all five individuals from four different sampling sites along its upper and middle stretch table s1 and fig s1 sm revealed hepatic residues of at least one second generation ar their total ar concentrations ranged between 1 3 and 8 5 μg kg fig 4 it was estimated that portions of main receive effluent contributions of more than 30 50 under low water conditions karakurt et al 2019 analyzed corresponding filet samples of three individuals from main river revealed no residues table s1 sm interestingly no ar residues were detected above their respective method detection limits in pooled mussel samples from two main sampling sites thereof one site with confirmed hepatic ar residues in fish fig s1 and table s1 sm as reported in previous studies bioaccumulation processes can widely differ among aquatic species due to complex interactions between various routes of uptake excretion passive release and metabolization streit 1998 furthermore substantial data gaps exist regarding the understanding of exposure pathways and potential adverse effects of chronic exposure with multiple active ingredients rattner et al 2014 making it nearly impossible at the moment to estimate the consequences of chronic ar exposure to freshwater fish nonetheless very persistent second generation ar such as brodifacoum will likely accumulate in the aquatic food chain when released into the aquatic environment and put predators at risk ruiz suarez et al 2016 serieys et al 2019 4 conclusions our results clearly indicate incomplete removal of ar during conventional wastewater treatment and confirm indirect exposure of aquatic organisms via wwtp effluents our findings also confirm high hepatic bioaccumulation potential and persistence of second generation ar in indigenous limnic fish based on the demonstrated temporal and spatial coherence between sewer baiting and hepatic anticoagulant residues in effluent exposed fish sewer baiting in combined sewer systems contributes to the release of active ingredients into raw wastewater and receiving streams respectively nevertheless realistic exposure estimations for the aquatic environment remain challenging given the non disclosure or non existence of domestic market data on rodenticide sales use and disposal future research should focus on identifying the ecotoxicological consequences of chronic rodenticide exposure to indigenous freshwater fish at concentrations relevant for surface water bodies as for most terrestrial species a link between hepatic ar residue levels in fish and species specific lethal

18428,hydrogen sulfide induced corrosion of concrete sewer pipes is a major issue for wastewater utilities globally one of the most commonly used methods to combat hydrogen sulfide is the addition of ferric chloride while a reliable and effective method ferric chloride is acidic causing oh s concerns as well as alkalinity consumption in sewage this study investigates under full scale field conditions an alternative method for sulfide control by in situ electrochemical generation of iron ions using sacrificial iron electrodes this method concomitantly produces alkalinity through cathodic oh generation rather than consumption the gaseous hydrogen sulfide concentrations at the discharge wet well of a real life rising main length 1 km in diameter 150 mm decreased from 173 ppm to 43 ppm 90 percentile of peak values when a current of 0 86 a m3 of sewage was applied the 90 percentile peak h2s value was further reduced to 6 6 ppm when the applied current was increased to 1 14 a m3 sewage moreover methane generation was almost completely inhibited from 25 3 1 46 mg cod l to 0 06 0 04 mg cod l the overall cell voltage remained constant throughout the experimental period clearly showing the stability of the process detailed characterization of the down stream sewer pipe biofilm revealed the complexity of the iron chemistry as the in situ produced iron ions undergo transformation into a variety of iron species overall this study demonstrates that in situ generation of iron and alkalinity is an effective alternative method for hydrogen sulfide control in sewers graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrogen sulfide abatement electrochemistry real life application sewer corrosion in situ chemical generation 1 introduction hydrogen sulfide induced corrosion of concrete sewer pipes is a major issue for water utilities worldwide hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 pikaar et al 2014 current methods typically implemented by the water industry for sulfide control predominantly rely on the continuous addition of chemicals including oxygen caustic soda magnesium hydroxide sodium nitrate and iron salts ganigue et al 2011 jiang et al 2015a zhang et al 2008 one of the most commonly used chemicals are iron salts either in the form of ferrous fecl2 or ferric chloride fecl3 to precipitate sulfide as iron sulfide ganigue et al 2011 werf 2007 it is considered a proven and robust sulfide control method that has been implemented by the water industry for several decades werf 2007 moreover very high removal efficiencies can be obtained with achievable dissolved sulfide concentrations of well below 1 mg l firer et al 2008 nielsen et al 2005 more recently in addition to its capability to precipitate sulfide to low concentrations some laboratory scale studies revealed that the addition of iron resulted in a substantial decrease i e up to 60 in the sulfide production rate zhang et al 2009 2012 thereby lowering the overall chemical requirements in these studies methanogenic activity was also found to be inhibited by 40 80 it was hypothesized that sulfate reducing bacteria srb and methanogens were inhibited by iron compounds although the exact mechanisms behind these substantial reductions could not be elucidated despite the above mentioned characteristics and advantages of iron salts dosing its use also comes with several drawbacks first the transport handling and storage of highly corrosive and strongly acidic iron salts e g pka fe h2o 6 3 is 2 20 is associated with occupational health and safety oh s concerns and requires special materials for the delivery and storage tanks to meet safety and regulation requirements werf 2007 in fact in some urban locations it is not even allowed for iron salts and often chemicals in general to be stored on site personal communication with water utilities secondly the strong acidic nature brezonik and arnold 2011 cornell and schwertmann 1996 of ferric salts and ferrous salts after oxidation of ferrous to ferric consumes alkalinity and results in decrease of the sewage ph while this reduction in ph might not be that substantial in absolute terms it has a significant impact on iron dosing requirements especially around the circumneutral ph values often observed in sewers for example firer et al 2008 found that in order to achieve the same effluent sulfide concentration of 0 1 mg s l the required iron dosing increases by about 200 when the ph of sewage was decreased from 7 0 to 6 5 to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks of conventional iron salts dosing we recently proposed an alternative method that allows for in situ electrochemical generation of ferrous fe2 ions from sewage using iron plates as sacrificial anodes lin et al 2017b during both short term and long term laboratory scale experiments the feasibility was successfully demonstrated this study showed that fe2 can be generated in situ in sewage at very high coulombic efficiencies i e 95 whereas long term experiments showed that sulfide was efficiently removed at an average removal efficiency of 95 4 4 4 over a period of 8 weeks a key advantage was found to be a slight increase in sewage ph due to concomitant alkalinity generation through cathodic oh formation contrarily to the acidifying effect of conventional iron salts dosing moreover it was found that the formation of solids aggregates normally observed during conventional electrocoagulation mollah et al 2001 sahu et al 2014 vong and garey 2014 could be avoided by applying low current densities and by minimizing the mixing intensity lin et al 2017b competing anodic reactions like oxygen evolution and direct sulfide oxidation at the electrode surface were completely avoided with the oxidation of iron to ferrous ions being the only anodic reaction taking place due to the low anode potentials lin et al 2017b while the above studies highlighted the working principle and potential of electrochemical iron oxidation and alkalinity generation the performance in terms of sulfide control under real sewer conditions was not investigated the experiments were conducted under controlled laboratory conditions using a small size 600 750 ml continuously stirred tank reactors cstr the conditions in sewers are fundamentally different as a sewer pipe is more like a plug flow reactor than a cstr secondly the flow is often characterized by large variations in sewage flow rate following a diurnal pattern the latter has enormous impact on the sulfide production rates resulting in highly dynamic hydrogen sulfide profiles sharma et al 2008 2013 finally several engineering challenges when scaling up the technologies from laboratory scale to full scale implementation can be expected for example our previous study highlighted the importance of minimizing the applied current density and inter electrode gap in order to minimize the voltage losses caused by the ohmic drop however in real life application in sewers the use of a small inter electrode gap may cause blockages in this study we aim to investigate the feasibility and long term performance of electrochemical oxidation of iron and alkalinity generation for efficient sulfide control in sewers through real life application to assess the performance in terms of sulfide control efficiency and electrochemical stability of the process the cell voltage of the electrochemical cell as well as the gaseous hydrogen sulfide concentration in the receiving wet well at the end of the sewer were continuously monitored enhanced by manual sampling and off line analysis of liquid period parameters in order to investigate the potential impact on srb and methanogenic activity moreover the fate and chemical transformations of the produced iron ions was also investigated by detailed characterization of the down stream sewer biofilm 2 material and methods 2 1 the full scale sewer site the electrochemical system described in the next sub section was placed at the pumping station of the uc09 rising main sewer blueash crescent oxenford qld 4210o queensland australia the sewer pipe has a length of 1080 m with an inner diameter of 150 mm see fig 1 and fig s1 and receives sewage from a residential area the submerged pumps inside the pumping station wet well operated by gold coast city council were operated in intermittent mode once the water level in the wet well reached 19 5 high level of the total height of the wet well a pump is turned on until the water level drops to 3 5 low level the sewage pumped in each pump run is estimated to be 3 9 m3 under normal dry weather conditions there are on average 43 pumping events per day equalling to an average dry weather daily flow of 140 m3 day the flow in dry weather follows a typical diurnal pattern resulting in a hrt ranging between 3 and 7 h depending on the time of the day as previously reported jiang et al 2013 during wet weather the sewage flow increases substantially see figs s3a f resulting in much shorter hrts with the lowest close to 1 h 2 2 the electrochemical cell and operation the electrochemical cell and other peripherals was placed within a 20 ft container fig 1 fig s2 nijhuis water technologies doetinchem the netherlands sewage was continuously pumped from the wet well 6 m deep into the electrochemical cell at a flow rate of 12 5 16 5 m3 hour using a grinder pump abs piranha grinder pump sulzer switzerland the flow fluctuated depending on the water level in the wet well as well as the level of solids and debris in the wastewater the effluent of the electrochemical cell was subsequently fed back into the wet well by means of gravity the electrochemical cell consisted of two rows of 50 carbon steel plates each with a weight of 19 kg and a dimension of 1 cm 60 cm 40 cm the carbon steel plates were placed within the cell with an inter electrode gap of 3 cm the latter distance was chosen in order to prevent potential blockages as the grinder pump cuts solids into pieces smaller than 3 cm as well as to minimize formation of ragging over time personal communication nijhuis water technology each row which comprised 50 carbon plates was galvanostatically controlled using separate power sources e amstel 3 amstel rectifiers the netherlands depending on the experimental period the current supplied to each row was 0 40 80 or 100 a respectively equalling to a total applied current of 80 120 and 160a in the three experimental periods p1 p3 respectively see section 2 3 considering a total anode surface of 12 m2 for each row the applied current density equalled to 3 3 8 3 a m 2 to allow for equal dissolution of the sacrificial electrodes polarity switching i e the anode becomes cathode and vice versa was automatically applied every 2 h the electrochemical cell was covered with a polyvinylchloride pvc lid with two transparent acrylic observation windows see fig s2 forced ventilation was continuously applied to the headspace of the reactor using air blowers to ensure that the produced hydrogen gas concentration was well below the lower explosive level i e 4 once per week the electrochemical cell was drained and flushed for 30 min to minimize build up of larger size particles and rags on the bottom of the cell 2 3 experimental protocol the experiments were divided into three periods namely i the baseline period ii the experimental period and iii the post experimental period see table 1 i the baseline period lasted for 7 weeks this period was included to determine the hydrogen sulfide concentrations in the gas phase in the discharge wet well as well as the liquid period sulfide and methane concentrations in the absence of electrochemical iron dosing ii the experimental period lasted for 14 weeks 99 days during which the cell was operational this period was further divided into three periods in which different total currents were supplied p1 80 a 6 5 weeks 46 days p2 120 a 3 weeks 21 days and p3 160 a 4 weeks 28 days these currents corresponded to an iron dosing rate of 14 21 and 28 mg fe per liter of sewage assuming a coulombic efficiency of 100 for the oxidation of fe to fe2 see supplementary information for more details on the calculations used and an average dry weather flow of 140 m3 day iii the post experimental period lasted for 6 weeks it was conducted in order to assess how quickly the gaseous hydrogen sulfide concentration would return to the baseline levels in addition the fate and transformations of the in situ produced iron ions as well as the microbial community were investigated by analyzing the chemical and microbial composition of the sewer biofilm see supplementary information 2 4 monitoring and sampling a hydrogen sulfide sensor was placed 50 cm above the water level in the discharging wet well fig 1 which enabled continuous logged every 60 s monitoring of the gaseous hydrogen sulfide concentration in the headspace of the wet well the sensor was calibrated every 4 weeks with a 50 ppm hydrogen sulfide calibration gas calgaz standard 50ppm h2s balance air which confirmed that sensor drift did not occur the overall cell voltage of each of the power sources were monitored online every 5 min using a national instruments compact rio controller 9066 with ni 92018 ai 10 v 12 bit 500 ks s aggregate input module the diurnal variation in sewage flow and consequently fluctuations in the hydraulic retention time as well as the impact of rain events were assessed based upon scada data which recorded the pump on off time the method reported in chen et al 2014 was used to calculate the sewage flow using the scada data a sampling point was placed at the pumping station as well as 828 m downstream of the inlet of the rising main fig 1 these sampling points were used to take grab samples for analysis of the dissolved sulfur species i e sulfide sulfite thiosulfate and sulfate volatile fatty acids iron total and dissolved dissolved methane ph and temperature 24 h composite sampling isco 3710 portable composite sampler was also conducted at the downstream sampling point to determine the fluctuations and actual iron concentration in the sewage caused by daily variation in sewage flow on the first day of the post treatment period a section of the sewer pipe with a length of 600 mm located at the sampling point 828 m downstream of the pumping station was removed from the rising main and replaced with a new pipe section the section was immediately filled with fresh sewage to maintain real sewer conditions thereby maintaining the integrity of the biofilm the pipe section was subsequently transported to the laboratory where biofilm samples were immediately frozen and stored at 80 c prior to x ray powder diffraction xrd and scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem eds analyses samples were freeze dried overnight and the resulting powder was immediately analyzed dna was extracted from 250 mg of thawed sewer biofilm using the power soil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories carlsbad ca according to the manufacturer s recommendations see supplementary information for more information 2 5 analytical methods dissolved sulfur species i e sulfide sulphite thiosulfate and sulfate were measured using ion chromatography equipped with a dionex 2010i system keller lehmann et al 2006 the ph and temperature of the sewage was measured using a hand held ph meter hanna instrument usa total and dissolved iron concentrations i e fe2 and fe3 as well as other cations and anions such as na mg ca2 po4 3 and so4 2 were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes 7300dv perkinelmer usa to measure the dissolved iron concentrations samples were pre filtered with a 0 22 μm membrane filters prior to analysis the protocol used to determine the dissolved methane concentrations is described in detail elsewhere alberto et al 2000 guisasola et al 2008 in summary 5 ml of sewage was immediately filtered using a 0 22 μm membrane filters and injected into an evacuated into an exetainer tube labco uk with a volume of 12 ml the sample was subsequently kept for 24 h in order for the gas and liquid period methane concentrations to reach equilibrium the gas period methane concentration was subsequently measured using a gas chromatography gc equipped with a flame ionization detector thereby allowing to calculate the liquid period methane concentration in the sewage using henry s law the volatile solids to total solids ration i e the vs ts ratio of the sewer biofilm was analyzed using standard methods 2540d and 2540e respectively apha 1995 volatile fatty acids vfas were analyzed using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a capillary column agilent 7890a db ffap 125 3212 xrd and sem eds analyses were carried out to investigate the fate and potential transformation of the in situ produced iron ions in the sewage by analysing the sewer pipe biofilm at the down stream sampling point x ray diffractograms were recorded with a d8 bruker diffractometer using a cu kα1 radiation at λ 1 55 å sem eds measurements were done using a hitachi su3500 scanning electron microscope equipped with oxford instruments x max sdd x ray detector enabling simultaneous imaging and elemental analysis at high count rates with 125ev energy resolution 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrogen sulfide control performance fig s4 shows a 24h gaseous h2s profile measured on a typical dry weather day in the baseline period along with pumping events on the day the wastewater discharge to the wet well induced a pumping event caused an immediate rise of the gaseous h2s concentration the h2s concentration then dropped gradually likely due to the draining of the wastewater from the wet well to the downstream gravity pipe until the next pumping event the magnitudes of the peaks are directly associated with the dissolved sulfide concentration in wastewater while the receding parts of the h2s profiles are more related to the hydraulics therefore an important indicator of the effectiveness of any sulfide strategies is the reduction of peak h2s levels with the above described method h2s peak values were identified from the h2s raw data measured during the entire experimental data see fig 2 a e it can be seen that during the baseline as well as the post treatment period hydrogen sulfide concentrations followed a similar pattern with the highest hydrogen sulfide concentrations observed in the morning 6 8 am consistent with previous reports jiang et al 2013 this is because that wastewater flow is lower at night time resulting in longest retention time of slugs discharged to the wet well in the early morning for a similar reason relatively higher h2s values were also observed in late afternoon and evening fig 2a e clearly shows that the h2s concentrations were substantially reduced with the commissioning of the electrochemical cell when a current of 80 a was applied in p1 the h2s concentrations were reduced to levels lower than 10 ppm for most of the time in a day however the morning peaks reached 150 ppm in comparison to 250 ppm measured in the baseline period with the increase in the current to 120 a and 160 a in p2 and p3 respectively the h2s peak values were further reduced to 80 and 20 ppm respectively fig 3 shows the 90 percentiles of the peak hydrogen sulfide concentrations measured during the baseline experimental p1 p3 and post treatment periods the 90 ile peak hydrogen sulfide concentrations during the baseline and post treatment periods were similar with peak values of 173 and 197 ppm respectively such high hydrogen sulfide levels are known to cause severe concrete corrosion jiang et al 2015b werf 2007 when a current of 0 57 a m3 p1 of sewage was applied the 90 ile peak hydrogen sulfide concentrations decreased to 92 ppm i e a reduction of 54 increasing the current to 0 86 a m3 p2 and 1 14 a m3 p3 of sewage resulted in 90 ile peak hydrogen sulfide levels of 43 ppm and 6 6 ppm respectively the latter corresponds to a reduction in hydrogen sulfide concentrations of 75 and 96 the reduction in gaseous h2s concentrations was supported by the liquid period measurement fig s6 the dissolved sulfide concentrations were clearly lower p 0 05 in the experimental period p1 than in the baseline period figure s6 7 4 2 3 versus 1 5 1 4 mg s l also the wastewater ph was higher p 0 05 in the experimental period p1 than in the baseline period i e 8 5 0 5 versus 8 0 0 5 both lowered dissolved sulfide concentrations and elevated ph would have contributed to the reduced gaseous h2s concentrations however the dissolved sulfide concentrations was 4 3 mg s l at 7am on the day of the measurement in p1 which explains the relatively high gaseous h2s values in the morning in p1 fig 2b the dissolved sulfide concentrations then dropped to values below 1 mg s l which in conjunction with elevated ph almost 8 5 resulted in much lowered gaseous h2s concentration for the rest of the day 3 2 electrochemical cell performance fig 4 a shows that during the course of the different experimental periods stable cell voltages were obtained ranging between 1 86 0 19 to 3 92 0 4 v depending on the current density applied these values correspond to a power input of 0 040 0 062 0 082 kwh m3 treated at a total current input of 80 120 and 160a respectively the slight fluctuations in the cell voltages that were repeatedly obtained within a 24 h cycle see fig s5 can be attributed to slight fluctuations in sewage composition e g ph and conductivity due to diurnal consumption patterns importantly throughout the course of the field trials there were no signs of electrode passivation or scaling indicating that a constant electrochemical performance in terms of power requirements can be achieved and can be maintained over a long period of time without the need for electrode maintenance and replacement while the electrochemical performance in terms of power requirements to dissolve iron ions expressed in kg fe was stable as a consequence of the constant applied current and a highly dynamic diurnal pattern in hydraulic flow under dry weather conditions the measured total iron concentration fluctuated over time ranging between 7 and 42 mg fe l depending on the time of the day see fig 4b these values are comparable with conventional iron dosing as dosing iron salts at a constant rate is a commonly used chemical dosing strategy ganigue et al 2011 consequently the process performance in terms of required current applied to the electrochemical cell in order to dissolve sufficient iron expressed in mg fe l sewage was not constant throughout a diurnal cycle due to the use of a grinder pump blockages within the electrochemical did not occur throughout the trials however due to the almost universal presence of solids e g hair plastics toilet paper cleaning tissues and other non degradable coarse material in sewage ragging and build up of solids in the bottom of the reactor could not be completely avoided therefore the electrochemical cell was manually drained and flushed for 30 min once per week the latter frequency and duration was found to be sufficient in order avoiding build up of solids on the bottom of the reactor 3 3 the complexity of iron chemistry in the downstream sewer biofilm part of the produced iron is expected to be integrated in the biofilm matrix thereby reducing the volatile solids to total solids fraction of the biofilm zhang et al 2012 indeed after three months operation the vs ts ratio of the sewer biofilm was found to be 0 11 the latter is substantially higher than vs ts ratios normally observed in sewer biofilms not subjected to chemical dosing zhang et al 2012 indicating that part of the produced iron oxides attached to the sewer biofilm to characterise the iron speciation and morphology in the downstream biofilm xrd and sem eds analyses were conducted the x ray diffractograms indicate that amorphous material was dominant in the sewer biofilm see fig s7 amongst the iron oxide species several polymorphs of feooh were identified such as goethite α feooh akaganeite β feooh and feroxyhyte δ feooh others were bernalite fe oh 3 hematite ɛ fe2o3 magnetite fe3o4 and wustite feo several studies reported on the iron speciation during electrocoagulation dubrawski and mohseni 2013 dubrawski et al 2015 tsouris et al 2001 van genuchten et al 2012 these studies revealed that electrochemical iron oxidation is a very complex process in which a variety of amorphous and crystalline iron oxide species found in the biofilm can be produced electrochemically such as magnetite hematite akaganeite and feroxyhyte it was however not possible to elucidate whether these were indeed in situ generated or formed as result of chemical transformation over time poulton et al 2004 once embedded within the biofilm matrix in addition to the amorphous iron oxide species several crystalline fe s and fe p species were also found as indicated by their weak diffraction signals iron sulfide species were identified as marcasite and or pyrite fes2 mackinawite fes greigite fe3s4 pyrrhotite fe 1 x s x 0 0 2 and or troilite fes the latter is a nonstoichiometric variant of fes which is also called magnetic pyrite due to resemblance in color of pyrite with weak magnetic properties in addition traces of iron phosphate minerals were also found such as graftonite fe3 po4 2 and iron phosphide fep4 sem eds of multiple samples mapped at different magnifications revealed consistently similar elemental composition matrices comprised by c o n fe s and ca elements under 1 wt were found as follows si 0 9 al 0 5 p 0 7 na 0 4 cl 0 4 and mg 0 3 it is worth noting that fe and s exhibit similar atomic percentages 3 and that they correlate across maps infigure s6 b brighter domains of the micrograph represent areas rich in both fe and s 3 4 the impact on methane emissions in addition to hydrogen sulfide control the iron dosing also had a clear inhibitory effect on the methanogenic activity of the sewer biofilm in fact methane generation was almost completely inhibited with reductions in the downstream methane concentrations from 25 3 1 46 mg cod l to 0 06 0 04 mg cod l during the baseline period and the experimental period p1 respectively i e 99 reduction fig s6 this extent of inhibitions is substantially higher than that obtained during previous laboratory scale studies using ferric chloride dosing with inhibition of methanogenic activity of about 40 80 zhang et al 2009 2012 these findings are highly relevant from a practical point of view as methane a potent greenhouse gas emissions from sewers are considered problematic for wastewater utilities as these emission often comprise a substantial fraction of the overall carbon footprint of these utilities guisasola et al 2008 2009 despite reduced methane emissions a methanogenic archaeal population genus methanosaeta represented one of the dominant members of the biofilm communities in three of four pipe sections characterised fig s8 further research is needed to characterise the activity of this population and explain this finding microbial communities also harboured sulfate reducing bacteria such as a desulfobulbus population fig s8 contrarily to the clear impact on methane inhibition there was no clear long term inhibitory impact on srb activity in fact peak hydrogen sulfide concentrations even slightly exceeded the levels prior to iron dosing fig 3 however it is not possible to elucidate whether iron had an inhibitory effect on the srb activity with the available data the hrt in the uc09 rising main ranges between 3 and 7 h considering these hrt values even in the case srb activity would be reduced the sulfate reduction rates under these long hrts would still result in elevated hydrogen sulfide levels at the end of the rising main 3 5 implications for practice through long term full scale testing this study demonstrated that electrochemical oxidation of iron and alkalinity generation through cathodic oh formation is a highly efficient method and represents a first step for water utilities towards electrochemical sulfide control in sewers the 90 percentile peak hydrogen sulfide concentrations were reduced from 173 ppm baseline to 6 6 ppm experimental period p3 at a current input of 1 14 a m3 sewage equally important throughout the course of the trials the electrochemical performance was very stable with very constant cell voltage indicating that electrode passivation caused by inorganic scaling did not take place the process can be further optimized by applying more advanced electrical control systems in this study the electrochemical cell was galvanostatically controlled at fixed current inputs as explained in section 3 2 the combination of constant current applied with a diurnal pattern in hydraulic flow under dry weather conditions the iron concentration in the sewage was not constant see fig 4b consequently the required current applied to the electrochemical cell in order to dissolve sufficient iron to completely control sulfide throughout a diurnal cycle was not optimized in a recent study ganigué et al 2018 developed an on line control algorithm for the dosing of fecl3 for sulfide control in sewers ganigué et al 2018 the method involved predicting using flow data measured on line sulfide formation in a sewer pipe and determining the dosing rate based on the predicted need the proposed method can be easily applied to the control of current in our electrochemical cell based on the results obtained during this full scale investigation our cost calculation showed that the operational costs for electrochemical iron oxidation and alkalinity were estimated to be about 25 49 3 ml sewage treated see supplementary information table s1 the latter clearly shows the economic competitiveness of this method as a recent industry survey revealed that chemical costs for commonly used chemicals for sulfide control implemented by the water industry range between 10 9 and 484 ml treated ganigue et al 2011 the technology is especially interesting in situations where on site storage of chemicals is not allowed to become a mature technology ready for market uptake by the water industry the hydraulic design of the electrochemical cell needs to be further optimized first the electrochemical cell should either be operated continuously with automatic draining cycles second the cell will need to be designed hydraulically as such that there are no dead zones inside the reactor i e a too low up flow velocities facilitates settling and build up of solids the use of computational fluid dynamics cfd modelling will play a crucial role in achieving optimal system designs that are not prone to solid settling and build up rehman et al 2017 samstag et al 2016 in order to become a viable approach for larger scale sewer pipes with higher flows it is essential to reduce the hydraulic load to the reactor to do so one could operate the electrochemical in semi batch mode where only a fraction of the sewage is fed to the reactor an alternative approach in which the use of sewage is completely avoided is to operate the system in batch mode using tap water recently the feasibility of such an approach was demonstrated at laboratory scale by showing its working principle lin et al 2017a this study revealed that when operating in batch mode using tap water with the addition of low levels salts it was feasible to generate a moderate strengths i e 10 g l fe3o4 fe solution containing magnetite nanoparticles mnps subsequent precipitation experiments showed that liquid period hydrogen sulfide concentrations can reduced to levels well below 1 mg sulfide s l using these mnps research is currently underway investigating whether such an alternative approach could be an interesting alternative especially for larger scale sewer pipes 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the feasibility and long term performance of electrochemical iron oxidation with concomitant alkalinity generation for efficient hydrogen sulfide control in sewers at full scale the key findings of this work are electrochemical oxidation of iron and alkalinity generation can effectively control sulfide in sewers a stable system performance in terms of power consumption was achieved with stable cell voltages throughout the testing period of 3 months in addition to its effectiveness in controlling hydrogen sulfide near complete inhibition of methane emissions was achieved the chemistry of electrochemical oxidation and fate of iron is very complex as the in situ produced iron ions undergo transformation into a variety of iron species found to accumulate in the sewer biofilm declaration

18428,hydrogen sulfide induced corrosion of concrete sewer pipes is a major issue for wastewater utilities globally one of the most commonly used methods to combat hydrogen sulfide is the addition of ferric chloride while a reliable and effective method ferric chloride is acidic causing oh s concerns as well as alkalinity consumption in sewage this study investigates under full scale field conditions an alternative method for sulfide control by in situ electrochemical generation of iron ions using sacrificial iron electrodes this method concomitantly produces alkalinity through cathodic oh generation rather than consumption the gaseous hydrogen sulfide concentrations at the discharge wet well of a real life rising main length 1 km in diameter 150 mm decreased from 173 ppm to 43 ppm 90 percentile of peak values when a current of 0 86 a m3 of sewage was applied the 90 percentile peak h2s value was further reduced to 6 6 ppm when the applied current was increased to 1 14 a m3 sewage moreover methane generation was almost completely inhibited from 25 3 1 46 mg cod l to 0 06 0 04 mg cod l the overall cell voltage remained constant throughout the experimental period clearly showing the stability of the process detailed characterization of the down stream sewer pipe biofilm revealed the complexity of the iron chemistry as the in situ produced iron ions undergo transformation into a variety of iron species overall this study demonstrates that in situ generation of iron and alkalinity is an effective alternative method for hydrogen sulfide control in sewers

concrete sewer pipes is a major issue for water utilities worldwide hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 pikaar et al 2014 current methods typically implemented by the water industry for sulfide control predominantly rely on the continuous addition of chemicals including oxygen caustic soda magnesium hydroxide sodium nitrate and iron salts ganigue et al 2011 jiang et al 2015a zhang et al 2008 one of the most commonly used chemicals are iron salts either in the form of ferrous fecl2 or ferric chloride fecl3 to precipitate sulfide as iron sulfide ganigue et al 2011 werf 2007 it is considered a proven and robust sulfide control method that has been implemented by the water industry for several decades werf 2007 moreover very high removal efficiencies can be obtained with achievable dissolved sulfide concentrations of well below 1 mg l firer et al 2008 nielsen et al 2005 more recently in addition to its capability to precipitate sulfide to low concentrations some laboratory scale studies revealed that the addition of iron resulted in a substantial decrease i e up to 60 in the sulfide production rate zhang et al 2009 2012 thereby lowering the overall chemical requirements in these studies methanogenic activity was also found to be inhibited by 40 80 it was hypothesized that sulfate reducing bacteria srb and methanogens were inhibited by iron compounds although the exact mechanisms behind these substantial reductions could not be elucidated despite the above mentioned characteristics and advantages of iron salts dosing its use also comes with several drawbacks first the transport handling and storage of highly corrosive and strongly acidic iron salts e g pka fe h2o 6 3 is 2 20 is associated with occupational health and safety oh s concerns and requires special materials for the delivery and storage tanks to meet safety and regulation requirements werf 2007 in fact in some urban locations it is not even allowed for iron salts and often chemicals in general to be stored on site personal communication with water utilities secondly the strong acidic nature brezonik and arnold 2011 cornell and schwertmann 1996 of ferric salts and ferrous salts after oxidation of ferrous to ferric consumes alkalinity and results in decrease of the sewage ph while this reduction in ph might not be that substantial in absolute terms it has a significant impact on iron dosing requirements especially around the circumneutral ph values often observed in sewers for example firer et al 2008 found that in order to achieve the same effluent sulfide concentration of 0 1 mg s l the required iron dosing increases by about 200 when the ph of sewage was decreased from 7 0 to 6 5 to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks of conventional iron salts dosing we recently proposed an alternative method that allows for in situ electrochemical generation of ferrous fe2 ions from sewage using iron plates as sacrificial anodes lin et al 2017b during both short term and long term laboratory scale experiments the feasibility was successfully demonstrated this study showed that fe2 can be generated in situ in sewage at very high coulombic efficiencies i e 95 whereas long term experiments showed that sulfide was efficiently removed at an average removal efficiency of 95 4 4 4 over a period of 8 weeks a key advantage was found to be a slight increase in sewage ph due to concomitant alkalinity generation through cathodic oh formation contrarily to the acidifying effect of conventional iron salts dosing moreover it was found that the formation of solids aggregates normally observed during conventional electrocoagulation mollah et al 2001 sahu et al 2014 vong and garey 2014 could be avoided by applying low current densities and by minimizing the mixing intensity lin et al 2017b competing anodic reactions like oxygen evolution and direct sulfide oxidation at the electrode surface were completely avoided with the oxidation of iron to ferrous ions being the only anodic reaction taking place due to the low anode potentials lin et al 2017b while the above studies highlighted the working principle and potential of electrochemical iron oxidation and alkalinity generation the performance in terms of sulfide control under real sewer conditions was not investigated the experiments were conducted under controlled laboratory conditions using a small size 600 750 ml continuously stirred tank reactors cstr the conditions in sewers are fundamentally different as a sewer pipe is more like a plug flow reactor than a cstr secondly the flow is often characterized by large variations in sewage flow rate following a diurnal pattern the latter has enormous impact on the sulfide production rates resulting in highly dynamic hydrogen sulfide profiles sharma et al 2008 2013 finally several engineering challenges when scaling up the technologies from laboratory scale to full scale implementation can be expected for example our previous study highlighted the importance of minimizing the applied current density and inter electrode gap in order to minimize the voltage losses caused by the ohmic drop however in real life application in sewers the use of a small inter electrode gap may cause blockages in this study we aim to investigate the feasibility and long term performance of electrochemical oxidation of iron and alkalinity generation for efficient sulfide control in sewers through real life application to assess the performance in terms of sulfide control efficiency and electrochemical stability of the process the cell voltage of the electrochemical cell as well as the gaseous hydrogen sulfide concentration in the receiving wet well at the end of the sewer were continuously monitored enhanced by manual sampling and off line analysis of liquid period parameters in order to investigate the potential impact on srb and methanogenic activity moreover the fate and chemical transformations of the produced iron ions was also investigated by detailed characterization of the down stream sewer biofilm 2 material and methods 2 1 the full scale sewer site the electrochemical system described in the next sub section was placed at the pumping station of the uc09 rising main sewer blueash crescent oxenford qld 4210o queensland australia the sewer pipe has a length of 1080 m with an inner diameter of 150 mm see fig 1 and fig s1 and receives sewage from a residential area the submerged pumps inside the pumping station wet well operated by gold coast city council were operated in intermittent mode once the water level in the wet well reached 19 5 high level of the total height of the wet well a pump is turned on until the water level drops to 3 5 low level the sewage pumped in each pump run is estimated to be 3 9 m3 under normal dry weather conditions there are on average 43 pumping events per day equalling to an average dry weather daily flow of 140 m3 day the flow in dry weather follows a typical diurnal pattern resulting in a hrt ranging between 3 and 7 h depending on the time of the day as previously reported jiang et al 2013 during wet weather the sewage flow increases substantially see figs s3a f resulting in much shorter hrts with the lowest close to 1 h 2 2 the electrochemical cell and operation the electrochemical cell and other peripherals was placed within a 20 ft container fig 1 fig s2 nijhuis water technologies doetinchem the netherlands sewage was continuously pumped from the wet well 6 m deep into the electrochemical cell at a flow rate of 12 5 16 5 m3 hour using a grinder pump abs piranha grinder pump sulzer switzerland the flow fluctuated depending on the water level in the wet well as well as the level of solids and debris in the wastewater the effluent of the electrochemical cell was subsequently fed back into the wet well by means of gravity the electrochemical cell consisted of two rows of 50 carbon steel plates each with a weight of 19 kg and a dimension of 1 cm 60 cm 40 cm the carbon steel plates were placed within the cell with an inter electrode gap of 3 cm the latter distance was chosen in order to prevent potential blockages as the grinder pump cuts solids into pieces smaller than 3 cm as well as to minimize formation of ragging over time personal communication nijhuis water technology each row which comprised 50 carbon plates was galvanostatically controlled using separate power sources e amstel 3 amstel rectifiers the netherlands depending on the experimental period the current supplied to each row was 0 40 80 or 100 a respectively equalling to a total applied current of 80 120 and 160a in the three experimental periods p1 p3 respectively see section 2 3 considering a total anode surface of 12 m2 for each row the applied current density equalled to 3 3 8 3 a m 2 to allow for equal dissolution of the sacrificial electrodes polarity switching i e the anode becomes cathode and vice versa was automatically applied every 2 h the electrochemical cell was covered with a polyvinylchloride pvc lid with two transparent acrylic observation windows see fig s2 forced ventilation was continuously applied to the headspace of the reactor using air blowers to ensure that the produced hydrogen gas concentration was well below the lower explosive level i e 4 once per week the electrochemical cell was drained and flushed for 30 min to minimize build up of larger size particles and rags on the bottom of the cell 2 3 experimental protocol the experiments were divided into three periods namely i the baseline period ii the experimental period and iii the post experimental period see table 1 i the baseline period lasted for 7 weeks this period was included to determine the hydrogen sulfide concentrations in the gas phase in the discharge wet well as well as the liquid period sulfide and methane concentrations in the absence of electrochemical iron dosing ii the experimental period lasted for 14 weeks 99 days during which the cell was operational this period was further divided into three periods in which different total currents were supplied p1 80 a 6 5 weeks 46 days p2 120 a 3 weeks 21 days and p3 160 a 4 weeks 28 days these currents corresponded to an iron dosing rate of 14 21 and 28 mg fe per liter of sewage assuming a coulombic efficiency of 100 for the oxidation of fe to fe2 see supplementary information for more details on the calculations used and an average dry weather flow of 140 m3 day iii the post experimental period lasted for 6 weeks it was conducted in order to assess how quickly the gaseous hydrogen sulfide concentration would return to the baseline levels in addition the fate and transformations of the in situ produced iron ions as well as the microbial community were investigated by analyzing the chemical and microbial composition of the sewer biofilm see supplementary information 2 4 monitoring and sampling a hydrogen sulfide sensor was placed 50 cm above the water level in the discharging wet well fig 1 which enabled continuous logged every 60 s monitoring of the gaseous hydrogen sulfide concentration in the headspace of the wet well the sensor was calibrated every 4 weeks with a 50 ppm hydrogen sulfide calibration gas calgaz standard 50ppm h2s balance air which confirmed that sensor drift did not occur the overall cell voltage of each of the power sources were monitored online every 5 min using a national instruments compact rio controller 9066 with ni 92018 ai 10 v 12 bit 500 ks s aggregate input module the diurnal variation in sewage flow and consequently fluctuations in the hydraulic retention time as well as the impact of rain events were assessed based upon scada data which recorded the pump on off time the method reported in chen et al 2014 was used to calculate the sewage flow using the scada data a sampling point was placed at the pumping station as well as 828 m downstream of the inlet of the rising main fig 1 these sampling points were used to take grab samples for analysis of the dissolved sulfur species i e sulfide sulfite thiosulfate and sulfate volatile fatty acids iron total and dissolved dissolved methane ph and temperature 24 h composite sampling isco 3710 portable composite sampler was also conducted at the downstream sampling point to determine the fluctuations and actual iron concentration in the sewage caused by daily variation in sewage flow on the first day of the post treatment period a section of the sewer pipe with a length of 600 mm located at the sampling point 828 m downstream of the pumping station was removed from the rising main and replaced with a new pipe section the section was immediately filled with fresh sewage to maintain real sewer conditions thereby maintaining the integrity of the biofilm the pipe section was subsequently transported to the laboratory where biofilm samples were immediately frozen and stored at 80 c prior to x ray powder diffraction xrd and scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem eds analyses samples were freeze dried overnight and the resulting powder was immediately analyzed dna was extracted from 250 mg of thawed sewer biofilm using the power soil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories carlsbad ca according to the manufacturer s recommendations see supplementary information for more information 2 5 analytical methods dissolved sulfur species i e sulfide sulphite thiosulfate and sulfate were measured using ion chromatography equipped with a dionex 2010i system keller lehmann et al 2006 the ph and temperature of the sewage was measured using a hand held ph meter hanna instrument usa total and dissolved iron concentrations i e fe2 and fe3 as well as other cations and anions such as na mg ca2 po4 3 and so4 2 were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes 7300dv perkinelmer usa to measure the dissolved iron concentrations samples were pre filtered with a 0 22 μm membrane filters prior to analysis the protocol used to determine the dissolved methane concentrations is described in detail elsewhere alberto et al 2000 guisasola et al 2008 in summary 5 ml of sewage was immediately filtered using a 0 22 μm membrane filters and injected into an evacuated into an exetainer tube labco uk with a volume of 12 ml the sample was subsequently kept for 24 h in order for the gas and liquid period methane concentrations to reach equilibrium the gas period methane concentration was subsequently measured using a gas chromatography gc equipped with a flame ionization detector thereby allowing to calculate the liquid period methane concentration in the sewage using henry s law the volatile solids to total solids ration i e the vs ts ratio of the sewer biofilm was analyzed using standard methods 2540d and 2540e respectively apha 1995 volatile fatty acids vfas were analyzed using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a capillary column agilent 7890a db ffap 125 3212 xrd and sem eds analyses were carried out to investigate the fate and potential transformation of the in situ produced iron ions in the sewage by analysing the sewer pipe biofilm at the down stream sampling point x ray diffractograms were recorded with a d8 bruker diffractometer using a cu kα1 radiation at λ 1 55 å sem eds measurements were done using a hitachi su3500 scanning electron microscope equipped with oxford instruments x max sdd x ray detector enabling simultaneous imaging and elemental analysis at high count rates with 125ev energy resolution 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrogen sulfide control performance fig s4 shows a 24h gaseous h2s profile measured on a typical dry weather day in the baseline period along with pumping events on the day the wastewater discharge to the wet well induced a pumping event caused an immediate rise of the gaseous h2s concentration the h2s concentration then dropped gradually likely due to the draining of the wastewater from the wet well to the downstream gravity pipe until the next pumping event the magnitudes of the peaks are directly associated with the dissolved sulfide concentration in wastewater while the receding parts of the h2s profiles are more related to the hydraulics therefore an important indicator of the effectiveness of any sulfide strategies is the reduction of peak h2s levels with the above described method h2s peak values were identified from the h2s raw data measured during the entire experimental data see fig 2 a e it can be seen that during the baseline as well as the post treatment period hydrogen sulfide concentrations followed a similar pattern with the highest hydrogen sulfide concentrations observed in the morning 6 8 am consistent with previous reports jiang et al 2013 this is because that wastewater flow is lower at night time resulting in longest retention time of slugs discharged to the wet well in the early morning for a similar reason relatively higher h2s values were also observed in late afternoon and evening fig 2a e clearly shows that the h2s concentrations were substantially reduced with the commissioning of the electrochemical cell when a current of 80 a was applied in p1 the h2s concentrations were reduced to levels lower than 10 ppm for most of the time in a day however the morning peaks reached 150 ppm in comparison to 250 ppm measured in the baseline period with the increase in the current to 120 a and 160 a in p2 and p3 respectively the h2s peak values were further reduced to 80 and 20 ppm respectively fig 3 shows the 90 percentiles of the peak hydrogen sulfide concentrations measured during the baseline experimental p1 p3 and post treatment periods the 90 ile peak hydrogen sulfide concentrations during the baseline and post treatment periods were similar with peak values of 173 and 197 ppm respectively such high hydrogen sulfide levels are known to cause severe concrete corrosion jiang et al 2015b werf 2007 when a current of 0 57 a m3 p1 of sewage was applied the 90 ile peak hydrogen sulfide concentrations decreased to 92 ppm i e a reduction of 54 increasing the current to 0 86 a m3 p2 and 1 14 a m3 p3 of sewage resulted in 90 ile peak hydrogen sulfide levels of 43 ppm and 6 6 ppm respectively the latter corresponds to a reduction in hydrogen sulfide concentrations of 75 and 96 the reduction in gaseous h2s concentrations was supported by the liquid period measurement fig s6 the dissolved sulfide concentrations were clearly lower p 0 05 in the experimental period p1 than in the baseline period figure s6 7 4 2 3 versus 1 5 1 4 mg s l also the wastewater ph was higher p 0 05 in the experimental period p1 than in the baseline period i e 8 5 0 5 versus 8 0 0 5 both lowered dissolved sulfide concentrations and elevated ph would have contributed to the reduced gaseous h2s concentrations however the dissolved sulfide concentrations was 4 3 mg s l at 7am on the day of the measurement in p1 which explains the relatively high gaseous h2s values in the morning in p1 fig 2b the dissolved sulfide concentrations then dropped to values below 1 mg s l which in conjunction with elevated ph almost 8 5 resulted in much lowered gaseous h2s concentration for the rest of the day 3 2 electrochemical cell performance fig 4 a shows that during the course of the different experimental periods stable cell voltages were obtained ranging between 1 86 0 19 to 3 92 0 4 v depending on the current density applied these values correspond to a power input of 0 040 0 062 0 082 kwh m3 treated at a total current input of 80 120 and 160a respectively the slight fluctuations in the cell voltages that were repeatedly obtained within a 24 h cycle see fig s5 can be attributed to slight fluctuations in sewage composition e g ph and conductivity due to diurnal consumption patterns importantly throughout the course of the field trials there were no signs of electrode passivation or scaling indicating that a constant electrochemical performance in terms of power requirements can be achieved and can be maintained over a long period of time without the need for electrode maintenance and replacement while the electrochemical performance in terms of power requirements to dissolve iron ions expressed in kg fe was stable as a consequence of the constant applied current and a highly dynamic diurnal pattern in hydraulic flow under dry weather conditions the measured total iron concentration fluctuated over time ranging between 7 and 42 mg fe l depending on the time of the day see fig 4b these values are comparable with conventional iron dosing as dosing iron salts at a constant rate is a commonly used chemical dosing strategy ganigue et al 2011 consequently the process performance in terms of required current applied to the electrochemical cell in order to dissolve sufficient iron expressed in mg fe l sewage was not constant throughout a diurnal cycle due to the use of a grinder pump blockages within the electrochemical did not occur throughout the trials however due to the almost universal presence of solids e g hair plastics toilet paper cleaning tissues and other non degradable coarse material in sewage ragging and build up of solids in the bottom of the reactor could not be completely avoided therefore the electrochemical cell was manually drained and flushed for 30 min once per week the latter frequency and duration was found to be sufficient in order avoiding build up of solids on the bottom of the reactor 3 3 the complexity of iron chemistry in the downstream sewer biofilm part of the produced iron is expected to be integrated in the biofilm matrix thereby reducing the volatile solids to total solids fraction of the biofilm zhang et al 2012 indeed after three months operation the vs ts ratio of the sewer biofilm was found to be 0 11 the latter is substantially higher than vs ts ratios normally observed in sewer biofilms not subjected to chemical dosing zhang et al 2012 indicating that part of the produced iron oxides attached to the sewer biofilm to characterise the iron speciation and morphology in the downstream biofilm xrd and sem eds analyses were conducted the x ray diffractograms indicate that amorphous material was dominant in the sewer biofilm see fig s7 amongst the iron oxide species several polymorphs of feooh were identified such as goethite α feooh akaganeite β feooh and feroxyhyte δ feooh others were bernalite fe oh 3 hematite ɛ fe2o3 magnetite fe3o4 and wustite feo several studies reported on the iron speciation during electrocoagulation dubrawski and mohseni 2013 dubrawski et al 2015 tsouris et al 2001 van genuchten et al 2012 these studies revealed that electrochemical iron oxidation is a very complex process in which a variety of amorphous and crystalline iron oxide species found in the biofilm can be produced electrochemically such as magnetite hematite akaganeite and feroxyhyte it was however not possible to elucidate whether these were indeed in situ generated or formed as result of chemical transformation over time poulton et al 2004 once embedded within the biofilm matrix in addition to the amorphous iron oxide species several crystalline fe s and fe p species were also found as indicated by their weak diffraction signals iron sulfide species were identified as marcasite and or pyrite fes2 mackinawite fes greigite fe3s4 pyrrhotite fe 1 x s x 0 0 2 and or troilite fes the latter is a nonstoichiometric variant of fes which is also called magnetic pyrite due to resemblance in color of pyrite with weak magnetic properties in addition traces of iron phosphate minerals were also found such as graftonite fe3 po4 2 and iron phosphide fep4 sem eds of multiple samples mapped at different magnifications revealed consistently similar elemental composition matrices comprised by c o n fe s and ca elements under 1 wt were found as follows si 0 9 al 0 5 p 0 7 na 0 4 cl 0 4 and mg 0 3 it is worth noting that fe and s exhibit similar atomic percentages 3 and that they correlate across maps infigure s6 b brighter domains of the micrograph represent areas rich in both fe and s 3 4 the impact on methane emissions in addition to hydrogen sulfide control the iron dosing also had a clear inhibitory effect on the methanogenic activity of the sewer biofilm in fact methane generation was almost completely inhibited with reductions in the downstream methane concentrations from 25 3 1 46 mg cod l to 0 06 0 04 mg cod l during the baseline period and the experimental period p1 respectively i e 99 reduction fig s6 this extent of inhibitions is substantially higher than that obtained during previous laboratory scale studies using ferric chloride dosing with inhibition of methanogenic activity of about 40 80 zhang et al 2009 2012 these findings are highly relevant from a practical point of view as methane a potent greenhouse gas emissions from sewers are considered problematic for wastewater utilities as these emission often comprise a substantial fraction of the overall carbon footprint of these utilities guisasola et al 2008 2009 despite reduced methane emissions a methanogenic archaeal population genus methanosaeta represented one of the dominant members of the biofilm communities in three of four pipe sections characterised fig s8 further research is needed to characterise the activity of this population and explain this finding microbial communities also harboured sulfate reducing bacteria such as a desulfobulbus population fig s8 contrarily to the clear impact on methane inhibition there was no clear long term inhibitory impact on srb activity in fact peak hydrogen sulfide concentrations even slightly exceeded the levels prior to iron dosing fig 3 however it is not possible to elucidate whether iron had an inhibitory effect on the srb activity with the available data the hrt in the uc09 rising main ranges between 3 and 7 h considering these hrt values even in the case srb activity would be reduced the sulfate reduction rates under these long hrts would still result in elevated hydrogen sulfide levels at the end of the rising main 3 5 implications for practice through long term full scale testing this study demonstrated that electrochemical oxidation of iron and alkalinity generation through cathodic oh formation is a highly efficient method and represents a first step for water utilities towards electrochemical sulfide control in sewers the 90 percentile peak hydrogen sulfide concentrations were reduced from 173 ppm baseline to 6 6 ppm experimental period p3 at a current input of 1 14 a m3 sewage equally important throughout the course of the trials the electrochemical performance was very stable with very constant cell voltage indicating that electrode passivation caused by inorganic scaling did not take place the process can be further optimized by applying more advanced electrical control systems in this study the electrochemical cell was galvanostatically controlled at fixed current inputs as explained in section 3 2 the combination of constant current applied with a diurnal pattern in hydraulic flow under dry weather conditions the iron concentration in the sewage was not constant see fig 4b consequently the required current applied to the electrochemical cell in order to dissolve sufficient iron to completely control sulfide throughout a diurnal cycle was not optimized in a recent study ganigué et al 2018 developed an on line control algorithm for the dosing of fecl3 for sulfide control in sewers ganigué et al 2018 the method involved predicting using flow data measured on line sulfide formation in a sewer pipe and determining the dosing rate based on the predicted need the proposed method can be easily applied to the control of current in our electrochemical cell based on the results obtained during this full scale investigation our cost calculation showed that the operational costs for electrochemical iron oxidation and alkalinity were estimated to be about 25 49 3 ml sewage treated see supplementary information table s1 the latter clearly shows the economic competitiveness of this method as a recent industry survey revealed that chemical costs for commonly used chemicals for sulfide control implemented by the water industry range between 10 9 and 484 ml treated ganigue et al 2011 the technology is especially interesting in situations where on site storage of chemicals is not allowed to become a mature technology ready for market uptake by the water industry the hydraulic design of the electrochemical cell needs to be further optimized first the electrochemical cell should either be operated continuously with automatic draining cycles second the cell will need to be designed hydraulically as such that there are no dead zones inside the reactor i e a too low up flow velocities facilitates settling and build up of solids the use of computational fluid dynamics cfd modelling will play a crucial role in achieving optimal system designs that are not prone to solid settling and build up rehman et al 2017 samstag et al 2016 in order to become a viable approach for larger scale sewer pipes with higher flows it is essential to reduce the hydraulic load to the reactor to do so one could operate the electrochemical in semi batch mode where only a fraction of the sewage is fed to the reactor an alternative approach in which the use of sewage is completely avoided is to operate the system in batch mode using tap water recently the feasibility of such an approach was demonstrated at laboratory scale by showing its working principle lin et al 2017a this study revealed that when operating in batch mode using tap water with the addition of low levels salts it was feasible to generate a moderate strengths i e 10 g l fe3o4 fe solution containing magnetite nanoparticles mnps subsequent precipitation experiments showed that liquid period hydrogen sulfide concentrations can reduced to levels well below 1 mg sulfide s l using these mnps research is currently underway investigating whether such an alternative approach could be an interesting alternative especially for larger scale sewer pipes 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the feasibility and long term performance of electrochemical iron oxidation with concomitant alkalinity generation for efficient hydrogen sulfide control in sewers at full scale the key findings of this work are electrochemical oxidation of iron and alkalinity generation can effectively control sulfide in sewers a stable system performance in terms of power consumption was achieved with stable cell voltages throughout the testing period of 3 months in addition to its effectiveness in controlling hydrogen sulfide near complete inhibition of methane emissions was achieved the chemistry of electrochemical oxidation and fate of iron is very complex as the in situ produced iron ions undergo transformation into a variety of iron species found to accumulate in the sewer biofilm declaration

18429,cyanobacterial surface scum here defined as visible cyanobacteria colonies accumulating at the lake surface is a harmful phenomenon that negatively affects water quality human and animal health colony forming microcystis is one of the most important and ubiquitous genera that can suddenly accumulate at water surfaces turbulent water motion e g generated by wind can vertically disperse this scum layer which later can re establish by upward migration of microcystis colonies however the role of wind generated turbulence in scum formation and development is still poorly understood here we present results from a laboratory mesocosm study where we analysed the processes of scum formation and its response to wind generated turbulence at low wind speed 3 6 m s 1 microcystis colony size and flow velocity at the water surface and in the bulk water were measured using a microscope camera and particle tracking velocimetry the surface scum formed by aggregation of colonies at the water surface where they formed loose clusters of increasing size the presence of large colony aggregations or of a surface film determined the stability of the scum layer for the largest applied wind speed most of the aggregations were broken down to sizes 2 mm which were dispersed to the bulk water the surface scum recovered quickly from such disturbances after the wind speed decreased we further observed reduced momentum transfer from wind to water with the growing scum layer the presence of the scum increased the threshold wind speed for the onset of flow and reduced the flow velocities that were generated above that threshold this effect was likely caused by the presence of a film of surface active material at the water surface surface microlayer which is related to the presence of microcystis both the small scale turbulence and surface microlayer might play an important yet largely unexplored role in microcystis surface scum development in aquatic ecosystems improved understanding of the interplay of both processes will be instrumental for improving current mechanistic models for predicting surface bloom dynamics graphical abstract image 1 keywords cyanobacterial

mucilaginous microcystis colonies at the air water interface surface scum is a multi factor process and its underlying mechanism is still under debate liu et al 2019 xiao et al 2018 yamamoto et al 2011 wind generated turbulent mixing is known to be a determining factor for the spatial distribution of surface blooms by vertically dispersing the surface scum layer and by affecting the size distribution of colonies in the water column chen et al 2003 li et al 2013 samoudi et al 2016 under strong wind conditions shear forces cause disaggregation of microcystis colonies li et al 2018 lin et al 2015 and smaller colonies and cells are mixed throughout the water column preventing the formation of a scum layer or subsurface bloom a wind speed threshold for surface scum formation of around 3 m s 1 has been estimated by remote sensing at taihu lake hu et al 2010 huang et al 2015 qi et al 2018 while field observations of microcystis bloom and scum formation mostly lack detailed characterization of the turbulent flow laboratory experiments showed that small scale turbulence only marginally modulated algal nutrient uptake and microcystis growth rate in comparison to a stagnant control wilkinson et al 2016 xiao et al 2016 counter intuitively small scale turbulence stimulates colony formation in microcystis aeruginosa during the lag growth phase but disaggregates colonies during the exponential growth phase li et al 2013 extremely strong turbulence simulating typhoon induced mixing was also found to be beneficial for algal growth and favored colony forming microcystis on a longer time span liu et al 2019 in all previous laboratory experiments however turbulence was generated by oscillating grids liu et al 2019 regel et al 2004 or submerged impellers li et al 2018 the resulting flows were characterized by large spatial heterogeneities and strong shear forces in the vicinity of the moving parts of the turbulence generator the vertical distribution of turbulence can be expected to differ strongly from the vertical structure of turbulence in a wind mixed water column hence there is little mechanistic understanding about the role of small scale turbulence generated at low wind speed 3 m s 1 on the aggregation dynamics of microcystis colonies and surface scum formation improved knowledge about the physical processes and environmental conditions that govern and promote microcystis scum formation is critical for successful prediction and development of lake management and mitigation strategies to study the effect of small scale turbulence generated at the water surface at low wind speed on the formation and persistence of microcystis scum we conducted laboratory experiments in an annular flume the wind driven flow was simulated by controlled air circulation above the water surface and simulated a diurnal wind pattern colony size distributions and velocities were measured at the water surface and at multiple depths in the bulk water the results are expected to contribute to mechanistic understanding of the effect of wind generated turbulence on surface scum dynamics and guidance for future improvements of predictive models 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of material microcystis colonies used in our experiment were collected on january 20 2019 in guanqiao fish pond wuhan china the colonies were collected from the water surface 0 30 cm depth with silk plankton net of 63 μm mesh size to select predominantly microcystis colonies the samples were filtered through a 200 μm sieve and then the filtrate was concentrated with a 63 μm sieve immediately after transport to the laboratory the filtered microcystis scum samples were cultured in bg11 medium at 23 c and continuous light of 18 μmol photons s 1 m 2 microscopic observations showed that the sieved microcystis colonies consisted of various morphospecies mainly microcystis viridis m aeruginosa and m wesenbergii with 99 dominance of the entire phytoplankton the microcystis colony size ranged between 50 and 200 μm fig s1 hereafter we will refer to colony size distribution csd based on volume fraction of the microcystis population the csd of microcystis colonies were measured before sampling at 20 cm depth in the pond by using a laser in situ scattering and transmissometry instrument lisst 200x sequoia usa which reflects the natural size distribution in the pond at the beginning of the experiment csd was additionally measured in the laboratory using lisst 100x sequoia usa 2 2 experimental design the dynamics of microcystis colony aggregation scum

colonies 3l stock solution with a concentration of 1 4 106 colonies l 1 estimated under the microscope were added into the flume to promote the development of a scum layer the algae were growing in the flume under a very low wind speed 1 4 m s 1 for 12 h in darkness according to chen et al 2009 more colonies can float up in turbulent environments than in static water during the following 3 day experimental period january 24 26 2019 we applied a diurnal light cycle 12 12 h light dark periods darkness from 20 00 to 08 00 h combined with a typical diurnal wind distribution with maximum wind speed 3 6 m s 1 at noon fig 1 on each day the wind speed was stepwise increased and then decreased 0 1 4 2 5 and 3 6 m s 1 where each wind speed was applied for 1 2 h duration for each wind speed we measured flow velocities and microcystis colony size distributions at the water surface and at different depths in the bulk water the measurement started at 08 00 h on january 24 2019 fig 1 during the dark cycle wind speed was kept constant at the lowest level 1 4 m s 1 in the first night but increased to 2 5 m s 1 in the second night when the surface scum did not move under the lowest wind speed water temperature was monitored using a four channel thermometer voltcraft k204 germany the average temperature and standard deviation was 22 9 1 3 c and no temperature difference between the water surface and the bottom of the flume was observed 2 3 microcystis scum dynamic at the water surface time resolved observations of the surface scum formation and development were carried out for each wind speed color images of the water surface were recorded from above through binoculars stemi 2000 c zeiss germany equipped with a digital camera nex 7 sony japan bursts of images were recorded during 5 10 min 200 400 images at the beginning and at the end of each wind speed all pictures were combined for subsequent analysis during recording additional illumination of the water surface was provided by a cold light source kl 1500 lcd zeiss germany the images were calibrated using a ruler and had a resolution of 2 12 μm pixel 1 within a field of view of 9 0 5 1 mm individual microcystis colonies were identified in each image by automated image processing matlab image processing toolbox mathworks usa the analysis provided distributions of colony area and equivalent spherical diameter as well as the surface areal coverage of microcystis calculated as the percentage of water surface that was covered by colonies size distributions were binned in logarithmically distributed classes from 0 05 to 9 mm the equivalent diameter of colonies of complex shape represents a diameter of a volume equivalent sphere additional videos resolution of 6 25 μm pixel 1 frame rate of 25 hz were recorded starting from the second day of the experiment to measure the flow velocity of the surface scum layer the mean flow velocity of the water surface was estimated as the product of the frame rate and the mean horizontal displacement of colonies within the field of view of the camera the displacement was calculated as the maximum of the spatial cross correlation function of two subsequently recorded images water samples containing microcystis colonies were carefully collected from a thin surface layer a few upper millimeters from the surface representing microcystis surface scum using a 5 ml pipette after each change in wind speed the water was collected into 50 ml conical sterile polypropylene tubes for biomass estimation optical density measurements were performed at

the water column microcystis colony size and velocity in the bulk water were measured for each wind speed at three different depths near the water surface approx 0 2 4 cm depth in a middle layer 20 22 4 cm depth and close to the flume bottom approx 32 6 35 cm depth at each sampling depths a vertically oriented plane within the central region of the flume was illuminated by short 4 ns pulses of green laser light wavelength 532 nm nano l 200 15 litron uk at a repetition rate of 7 4 hz colonies within the approximately 3 mm thick light sheet were observed using a digital camera 1200 1600 pixel 14 bit greyscale intensity resolution hisense 610 pco germany in a perpendicular arrangement fig s2 the field of view of the camera was 18 24 mm with a calibrated resolution of 15 μm pixel 1 laser illumination and image acquisition were synchronized using the software dynamic studio version 3 20 dantec dynamics germany images were recorded for 3 min for each measurement individual microcystis colonies were detected in each image based on intensity thresholding and object detection in matlab the analysis was similar to that described above for colonies at the water surface and provided the distributions of colony area and equivalent spherical diameter as well as the areal colony density of microcystis calculated as the area covered by colonies divided by the total area of the field of view in each image size distributions were binned in logarithmically distributed size classes from 0 05 mm to 2 mm taken that the results of csd are presented as a volume distribution the volumetric median of colony diameter dv50 μm the colony size value when the volume percentile is 50 was computed to compare the average colony size of microcystis under different wind speed conditions at three different depth of water column the enrichment ratio er of microcystis was calculated as the ratio of surface areal coverage and the areal colony density in the middle layer of the bulk water two dimensional vertical and longitudinal colony velocities were estimated using particle tracking velocimetry with a backward difference algorithm for the displacement between colonies of similar sizes in two consecutive images 2 5 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance was applied to reveal the influence of wind speeds on the median size dv50 of microcystis colonies at three depth of the water column following anova a post hoc lsd test was conducted to determine significant groupings the vertical velocities of microcystis colonies under different wind speed conditions during the three days of the experiments were compared using the student s t test all statistical analysis was performed using the software package spss 19 0 ibm corp usa data are presented as mean standard deviation sd and were tested for statistical significance at a significance level p of 0 05 3 results 3 1 microcystis surface scum formation under different wind conditions during the three day experiment a surface scum layer developed and the areal coverage of the water surface with microcystis colonies increased from an average value of 3 3 2 2 at day 1 13 2 6 5 and 17 0 10 3 on day 2 and 3 respectively fig 2 a sample images micrographs of the surface scum development are shown in fig s3 meanwhile the biomass of microcystis colonies in the thin surface layer measured by both spectrophotometer and fluorimeter showed similar results and increased 3 4 fold fig s4 contrary to the increase in surface coverage the areal colony density in the bulk water decreased with most pronounced changes during day 1 fig 2b suggesting that the scum layer was produced by upward motion of colonies from the bulk water visual observations revealed that on day 2 and 3 the scum layer resembled an approximately 3 mm thick layer of loose colony assemblages directly below the water surface except for day 1 the colony concentration followed the diurnal pattern of wind speed the surface coverage by microcystis decreased in response to increasing wind speed meanwhile the colony density in the bulk water increased fig 2 this effect was most evident in the enrichment ratio er of microcystis er was below 10 on the first day but increased to values exceeding 100 during the following two days except for high wind speed conditions at midday fig 3 this is due to the entrainment of surface scum into the water column by wind generated vertical mixing when exposed to high wind in response to the decreasing wind speed in the afternoon ef fell rapidly back to their respective values at the same wind speed during the morning increasing wind speed suggesting a rapid recovery of the surface scum after the mixing moreover on a daily basis the efs measured at the same wind speed during increasing and during decreasing wind speed were comparable in magnitude fig 3 which suggests a dynamic equilibrium between microcystis colony density at the water surface and in the bulk water 3 2 microcystis colony size distributions under different wind conditions the median diameter dv 50 of microcystis colonies in the bulk water at three different depth were significantly different under high wind speed 2 5 and 3 6 m s 1 conditions p 0 05 one way anova large colonies dv 50 250 μm were only observed under high wind speed conditions fig 4 fig 5 e and fig 5f and a linear decrease of dv 50 with increasing depth h was observed under the highest wind speed w 0 42 h 1 64 r 2 0 99 under no and weak wind conditions microcystis colony size in the bulk water varied between 50 and 500 μm and was similar at each depth during the three days figs 4 and fig 5e and f these colonies dv 50 200 μm were slightly larger than those measured at the beginning of the experiment and before sampling in the pond dv 50 86 μm fig s1 likely due to the aggregation process during incubation in the flume under low wind conditions at the water surface in contrast colony size was already larger at the time of first sampling and rapidly increased to 1 mm throughout the experimental period fig 5a c associated with the development of the surface scum layer the response of the microcystis colony size distributions to wind differed on the first day of the experiment from that observed during the two following diurnal wind cycles at the first day the size distribution in the bulk water became similar to the colony size distribution at the water surface already at the lowest applied wind speed and remained unaffected by further increase of the wind speed the homogenization of size distributions indicates mixing of the larger colonies from the water surface into the bulk water already at the lowest wind speed fig 5a and d after the scum layer has formed day 2 and 3 figs 2 and 3 the colony size distributions became less sensitive to the applied wind speed and no or only minor changes were observed at low 1 4 m s 1 and medium 2 5 m s 1 wind speed fig 5e and f complete homogenization of the size distributions at the water surface and in the bulk water was only observed for the highest applied wind speed 3 6 m s 1 3 3 dynamics of microcystis colony velocity colony velocities in the bulk water varied between 1 5 mm s 1 during no wind conditions and a maximum value of 7 2 mm s 1 in the uppermost layer at the highest wind speed on day 1 fig 6 a f the residual flow in the absence of wind forcing can be related to convective water motions caused by latent heat fluxes at the water surface or heat transfer through the flume walls these motions caused also vertical velocity fluctuations with standard deviations of up to 0 5 mm s 1 and impeded direct observations of buoyancy driven sinking or floatation of microcystis colonies mean vertical velocities were not significantly different from zero in the absence of wind forcing using the student s t test because we did not observe a consistent size dependence of colony velocities fig s5 we consider the observed velocities as proxies for flow velocity the mean longitudinal flow velocity and fluctuations of both velocity components longitudinal and vertical generally increased for increasing wind speed and decreased with increasing depth fig 6 the mean flow velocities observed at particular wind speeds however decreased consistently from day 1 to day 3 the slopes of linear regressions between flow speed and wind speed decreased by more than a factor of six during the course of the experiment fig 7 a flow velocities at the water surface microscopic camera observations were up to a factor of five higher than in the bulk water and in accordance with the bulk observations surface velocities at each wind speed decreased with increasing scum development fig 7b although the slopes were significantly different from zero at all three days the dependence became increasingly non linear with an obvious suppression of momentum transfer from wind to water at low and medium wind speed there was almost no flow after day 1 under low 1 4 m s 1 and after day 2 also under medium 2 5 m s 1 wind speed 4 discussion 4 1 effect of wind generated turbulence on microcystis scum as observed in many eutrophic aquatic systems at low wind speed microcystis colonies formed a surface scum layer in our experiments the layer was formed by aggregation of submerged microcystis colonies below the water surface the size of the aggregations continuously increased and exceeded the size of colonies in the bulk water by more than one order of magnitude the majority of the biomass was in the surface scum starting from day 2 of the experiment coalescence of smaller colonies into larger aggregates in the surface layer was apparently an important mechanism during the scum formation recent experiments have demonstrated that this aggregation is facilitated by increased amounts of extracellular polymeric substances in colony aggregations xiao et al 2018 xu et al 2014 wind stress applied to the water surface reduced the size of the aggregations at the water surface to colonies 2 mm which were partly entrained into the bulk water the maximum wind speed of 3 6 m s 1 in our experiment was sufficient to homogenize the colony size distributions at the water surface and in the bulk water but did not result in a complete mixing of the microcystis biomass this result is consistent with field and remote sensing observations from lakes and reservoirs where local surface concentrations of cyanobacteria only appeared at wind speeds below 3 4 m s 1 cao et al 2006 george and edwards 1976 qi et al 2018 the vertical distribution of wind shear near the water surface is characterized by a viscous sublayer at the air water interface where turbulent motions are suppressed and a turbulent boundary layer below lorke and peeters 2006 the thickness of the viscous sublayer is reciprocally related to wind speed webster and hutchinson 1994 and for a wind speed of 3 6 m s 1 its thickness is approximately 2 mm which is comparable to the thickness of the observed scum layer in our experiments 3 mm consistent with the maximum colony sizes observed at high wind speeds in our experiments floating microcystis colonies or colony aggregation smaller than 2 mm were immersed in the surface viscous boundary layer webster and hutchinson 1994 proposed a trapping mechanism of colonies in the viscous sublayer where colonies in the bulk water are transported upward by turbulent eddies and stick to the viscous sublayer at the air water interface although we did not observe the initial development of the surface scum layer during the night between day 1 and 2 we speculate that the weak steady wind 1 4 m s 1 ultimately promoted the rapid initial microcystis scum formation in our experiments fig 2 although we measured the vertical velocity component of individual microcystis colonies buoyancy controlled floatation or sinking velocities could not be resolved we attribute this to the water motion which in the absence of wind forcing was driven by convection the residual flow velocity fluctuations in the absence of wind forcing of a few mm s 1 are exceeding expected floatation velocities of microcystis colonies nakamura et al 1993 rowe et al 2016 by about one order of magnitude the existence of large scale convective flow structures and secondary circulation at low wind can result in persistent local up and downwelling flows within the field of view of the camera which probably impede estimation of size dependent colony floatation velocities also from longer term averaging and prolonged measurements laboratory measurements of buoyancy controlled colony motion have typically been done in narrow settling columns where water motion is suppressed by the small size of the chamber and better thermal insulation although the lack of completely stagnant conditions can be considered as a shortcoming of our experimental approach it can be expected that such slow water motion are ubiquitously present in most environmental systems a combination of annular flumes with separate estimates of buoyant colony velocities in settling chambers can potentially provide insight into the relative role of colony buoyancy and surface trapping in the viscous sublayer at low wind speed further research into this direction appears important as current approaches for modeling and predicting microcystis bloom and scum formation consider buoyancy and turbulent mixing as the major regulating processes aparicio et al 2013 wang et al 2017 yang and kong 2013 4 2 effect of microcystis on turbulence generation by wind another important finding from our experiment was the unexpectedly strong reduction of momentum transfer from wind to water by the presence of the microcystis scum layer the threshold in wind speed for the onset of water motion increased and the flow velocity generated by each applied wind speed decreased with increasing scum development these observations reveal a stabilizing feedback mechanism between the scum layer and its physical environment by counteracting wind generated mixing and dispersion at low wind speeds two possible mechanisms can cause the reduction in momentum transfer from wind to water by the submerged scum layer the presence of a film of surface active material i e a surface microlayer or a change of viscosity of the water due to the presence of the scum layer by examining the bulk fluid properties of dense microcystis aggregations dervaux et al 2015 observed yield stress i e more solid behavior of the bacterial suspension at low shear rates where viscosity increased by three orders of magnitude if a critical shear rate was exceeded the suspension showed newtonian behavior with viscosity very close to that of water the authors ascribed these observations to the stabilizing effect of extracellular polymeric substances which provide the observed yield strength at low shear rates the critical shear rate 10 s 1 and corresponding viscosity 1 1 mpa s reported by dervaux et al 2015 suggest a critical shear stress of 10 2 pa which corresponds to a wind speed of about 2 9 m s 1 at lower wind speed the increased viscosity of the scum layer can therefore suppress turbulent motions in a vertically extended viscous sublayer consistent with our observations the large extent of the viscous sublayer in dense microcystis aggregations provides a potential mechanism for the increased threshold for wind generated mixing at low and medium wind speed the change in viscosity however would mainly result in a changing vertical distribution of wind generated flow velocity while the shear stress at the air water interface and thereby the total momentum transfer from air to water would remain unaffected the momentum transfer from wind to water is controlled by water surface roughness which at low wind speed is predominantly affected by water surface tension wind ripples and capillary waves the microcystis scum layer in our experiments was fully submerged and presence of the scum layer could not have affected the surface properties directly however films of surface active substances can form due to secretion of plankton lancelot and mathot 1987 although water surface tension was not included in our measurements we tested this hypothesis by performing additional measurements after the main experiment this preliminary test indicated a pronounced reduction of water surface tension up to 20 in the presence of microcystis colonies fig s6 although surface films have not yet been linked to surface scum formation in lakes and other inland waters biogenic surface microlayers surface slicks or films have been receiving increased scientific interests because of their potential importance for gas exchange biogeochemical cycling accumulation of pollutants and last but not least as a unique habitat for specialized organisms i e floating plankton cunliffe et al 2013 södergren 1987 similar to oil films these layers damp capillary waves alpers and hühnerfuss 1989 tempel and riet 1965 and therewith reduce the water surface roughness at low wind speed the reduced roughness causes a reduction in momentum transfer from wind to water wüest and lorke 2003 the reduction of water surface tension by a surfactant film excreted as or along with other extracellular polymeric substances by microcystis colonies may constitute an important process by which the scum forming bacteria affect their physical environment towards more favorable conditions 5 conclusions for the first time we analysed the formation and persistence of a microcystis scum layer under wind generated turbulence in controlled laboratory experiments our experiments revealed two important physical processes occurring at the water surface at low wind speed that may have been overlooked in former laboratory studies as well as in field assessments the strong velocity gradient within the viscous sublayer at the air water interface potentially promotes the growth of the scum layer by the trapping of colonies from the wind stirred bulk water below at high wind speed reduction of viscous sublayer thickness lead to erosion of the scum layer and entrainment of large colonies into the bulk water we further found experimental evidence for a strong suppression of momentum transfer from wind to water by the presence of the surface scum layer or by surface active material excreted by the microcystis cells the developing scum layer caused an increasing reduction of wind generated flow and turbulence and thus provided a stabilizing feedback mechanism of the surface bloom with its physical environment small scale turbulence and the microlayer at the water surface potentially play an important yet largely unexplored role in microcystis surface scum development in water bodies future studies should analyze the interactions of microcystis blooms with the water surface at greater detail particularly by including observations of the surface microlayer water surface tension and viscosity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

18429,cyanobacterial surface scum here defined as visible cyanobacteria colonies accumulating at the lake surface is a harmful phenomenon that negatively affects water quality human and animal health colony forming microcystis is one of the most important and ubiquitous genera that can suddenly accumulate at water surfaces turbulent water motion e g generated by wind can vertically disperse this scum layer which later can re establish by upward migration of microcystis colonies however the role of wind generated turbulence in scum formation and development is still poorly understood here we present results from a laboratory mesocosm study where we analysed the processes of scum formation and its response to wind generated turbulence at low wind speed 3 6 m s 1 microcystis colony size and flow velocity at the water surface and in the bulk water were measured using a microscope camera and particle tracking velocimetry the surface scum formed by aggregation of colonies at the water surface where they formed loose clusters of increasing size the presence of large colony aggregations or of a surface film determined the stability of the scum layer for the largest applied wind speed most of the aggregations were broken down to sizes 2 mm which were dispersed to the bulk water the surface scum recovered quickly from such disturbances after the wind speed decreased we further observed reduced momentum transfer from wind to water with the growing scum layer the presence of the scum increased the threshold wind speed for the onset of flow and reduced the flow velocities that were generated above that threshold this effect was likely caused by the presence of a film of surface active material at the water surface surface microlayer which is related to the presence of microcystis both the small scale turbulence and surface microlayer might play an important yet largely unexplored role in microcystis surface scum development in aquatic ecosystems improved understanding of the interplay of both processes will be instrumental for improving current mechanistic models for predicting surface bloom dynamics graphical abstract image 1 keywords cyanobacterial

during the exponential growth phase li et al 2013 extremely strong turbulence simulating typhoon induced mixing was also found to be beneficial for algal growth and favored colony forming microcystis on a longer time span liu et al 2019 in all previous laboratory experiments however turbulence was generated by oscillating grids liu et al 2019 regel et al 2004 or submerged impellers li et al 2018 the resulting flows were characterized by large spatial heterogeneities and strong shear forces in the vicinity of the moving parts of the turbulence generator the vertical distribution of turbulence can be expected to differ strongly from the vertical structure of turbulence in a wind mixed water column hence there is little mechanistic understanding about the role of small scale turbulence generated at low wind speed 3 m s 1 on the aggregation dynamics of microcystis colonies and surface scum formation improved knowledge about the physical processes and environmental conditions that govern and promote microcystis scum formation is critical for successful prediction and development of lake management and mitigation strategies to study the effect of small scale turbulence generated at the water surface at low wind speed on the formation and persistence of microcystis scum we conducted laboratory experiments in an annular flume the wind driven flow was simulated by controlled air circulation above the water surface and simulated a diurnal wind pattern colony size distributions and velocities were measured at the water surface and at multiple depths in the bulk water the results are expected to contribute to mechanistic understanding of the effect of wind generated turbulence on surface scum dynamics and guidance for future improvements of predictive models 2

with a 63 μm sieve immediately after transport to the laboratory the filtered microcystis scum samples were cultured in bg11 medium at 23 c and continuous light of 18 μmol photons s 1 m 2 microscopic

measured flow velocities and microcystis colony size distributions at the water surface and at different depths in the bulk water the measurement started at 08 00 h on january 24 2019 fig 1 during the dark cycle wind speed was kept constant at the lowest level 1 4 m s 1 in the first night but increased to 2 5 m s 1 in the second night when the surface scum did not move under the lowest wind speed water temperature was monitored using a four channel thermometer voltcraft k204 germany the average temperature and standard deviation was 22 9 1 3 c and no temperature difference between the water surface and the bottom of the flume was observed 2 3 microcystis scum dynamic at the water surface time resolved observations of the surface scum formation and development were carried out for each wind speed color images of the water surface were recorded from above through binoculars stemi 2000 c zeiss germany equipped with a digital camera nex 7 sony japan bursts of images were recorded during 5 10 min 200 400 images at the beginning and at the end of each wind speed all pictures were combined for subsequent analysis during recording additional illumination of the water surface was provided by a cold light source kl 1500 lcd zeiss germany the images were calibrated using a ruler and had a resolution of 2 12 μm pixel 1 within a field of view of 9 0 5 1 mm individual microcystis colonies were identified in each image by automated image processing matlab image processing toolbox mathworks usa the analysis provided distributions of colony area and equivalent spherical diameter

rate and the mean horizontal displacement of colonies within the field of view of the camera the displacement was calculated as the maximum of the spatial cross correlation function of two subsequently recorded images water samples containing microcystis colonies were carefully collected from a thin surface layer a few upper millimeters from the surface representing microcystis surface

distributions of colony area and equivalent spherical diameter as well as the areal colony density of microcystis calculated as the area covered by colonies divided by the total area of the field of

median of colony diameter dv50 μm the colony size value when the volume percentile is 50 was computed to compare the average colony size of microcystis under different wind speed conditions at three different depth of water column the enrichment ratio er of microcystis was calculated as the ratio of surface areal coverage and the areal colony density in the middle layer of the bulk water two dimensional vertical and longitudinal colony velocities were estimated using particle tracking velocimetry with a backward difference algorithm for the displacement between colonies of similar sizes in two consecutive images 2 5 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance was applied to reveal the influence of wind speeds on the median size dv50 of microcystis colonies at three depth of the water column following anova a post hoc lsd test was conducted to determine significant groupings the vertical velocities of microcystis colonies under different wind speed conditions during the three days of the experiments were compared using the student s t test all statistical analysis was performed using the software package spss 19 0 ibm corp usa data are presented as mean standard deviation sd and were tested for statistical significance at a significance level p of 0 05 3 results 3 1 microcystis surface scum formation under different wind conditions during the three day experiment a surface scum layer developed and the areal coverage of the water surface with microcystis colonies increased from an average value of 3 3 2 2 at day 1 13 2 6 5 and 17 0 10 3 on day 2 and 3 respectively fig 2 a sample images micrographs of the surface scum development are shown in fig s3 meanwhile the biomass of microcystis colonies in the thin surface layer measured by both spectrophotometer and fluorimeter showed similar results and increased 3 4 fold fig s4 contrary to the increase in surface coverage the areal colony density in the bulk water decreased with most pronounced changes during day 1 fig 2b suggesting that the scum layer was produced by upward motion of colonies from the bulk water visual observations revealed that on day 2 and 3 the scum layer resembled an approximately 3 mm thick layer of loose colony assemblages directly below the water surface except for day 1 the colony concentration followed the diurnal pattern of wind speed the surface coverage by microcystis decreased in response to increasing wind speed meanwhile the colony density in the bulk water increased fig 2 this effect was most evident in the enrichment ratio er of microcystis er was below 10 on the first day but increased to values exceeding 100 during the following two days except for high wind speed conditions at midday fig 3 this is due to the entrainment of surface scum into the water column by wind generated vertical mixing when exposed to high wind in response to the decreasing wind speed in the afternoon ef fell rapidly back to their respective values at the same wind speed during the morning increasing wind speed suggesting a rapid recovery of the surface scum after the mixing moreover on a daily basis the efs measured at the same wind speed during increasing and during decreasing wind speed were comparable in magnitude fig 3 which suggests a dynamic equilibrium between microcystis colony density at the water surface and in the bulk water 3 2 microcystis colony size distributions under different wind conditions the median diameter dv 50 of microcystis colonies in the bulk water at three different depth were significantly different under high wind speed 2 5 and 3 6 m s 1 conditions p 0 05 one way anova large colonies dv 50 250 μm were only observed under high wind speed conditions fig 4 fig 5 e and fig 5f and a linear decrease of dv 50 with increasing depth h was observed under the highest wind speed w 0 42 h 1 64 r 2 0 99 under no and weak wind conditions microcystis colony size in the bulk water varied between 50 and 500 μm and was similar at each depth during the three days figs 4 and fig 5e and f these colonies dv 50 200 μm were slightly larger than those measured at the beginning of the experiment and before sampling in the pond dv 50 86 μm fig s1 likely due to the aggregation process during incubation in the flume under low wind conditions at the water surface in contrast colony size was already larger at the time of first sampling and rapidly increased to 1 mm throughout the experimental period fig 5a c associated with the development of the surface scum layer the response of the microcystis colony size distributions to wind differed on the first day of the experiment from that observed during the two following diurnal wind cycles at the first day the size distribution in the bulk water became similar to the colony size distribution at the water surface already at the lowest applied wind speed and remained unaffected by further increase of the wind speed the homogenization of size distributions indicates mixing of the larger colonies from the water surface into the bulk water already at the lowest wind speed fig 5a and d after the scum layer has formed day 2 and 3 figs 2 and 3 the colony size distributions became less sensitive to the applied wind speed and no or only minor changes were observed at low 1 4 m s 1 and medium 2 5 m s 1 wind speed fig 5e and f complete homogenization of the size distributions at the water surface and in the bulk water was only observed for the highest applied wind speed 3 6 m s 1 3 3 dynamics of microcystis colony velocity colony velocities in the bulk water varied between 1 5 mm s 1 during no wind conditions and a maximum value of 7 2 mm s 1 in the uppermost layer at the highest wind speed on day 1 fig 6 a f the residual flow in the absence of wind forcing can be related to convective water motions caused by latent heat fluxes at the water surface or heat transfer through the flume walls these motions caused also vertical velocity fluctuations with standard deviations of up to 0 5 mm s 1 and impeded direct observations of buoyancy driven sinking or floatation of microcystis colonies mean vertical velocities were not significantly different from zero in the absence of wind forcing using the student s t test because we did not observe a consistent size dependence of colony velocities fig s5 we consider the observed velocities as proxies for flow velocity the mean longitudinal flow velocity and fluctuations of both velocity components longitudinal and vertical generally increased for increasing wind speed and decreased with increasing depth fig 6 the mean flow velocities observed at particular wind speeds however decreased consistently from day 1 to day 3 the slopes of linear regressions between flow speed and wind speed decreased by more than a factor of six during the course of the experiment fig 7 a flow velocities at the water surface microscopic camera observations were up to a factor of five higher than in the bulk water and in accordance with the bulk observations surface velocities at each wind speed decreased with increasing scum development fig 7b although the slopes were significantly different from zero at all three days the dependence became increasingly non linear with an obvious suppression of momentum transfer from wind to water at low and medium wind speed there was almost no flow after day 1 under low 1 4 m s 1 and after day 2 also under medium 2 5 m s 1 wind speed 4 discussion 4 1 effect of wind generated turbulence on microcystis scum as observed in many eutrophic aquatic systems at low wind speed microcystis colonies formed a surface scum layer in our experiments the layer was formed by aggregation of submerged microcystis colonies below the water surface the size of the aggregations continuously increased and exceeded the size of colonies in the bulk water by more than one order of magnitude the majority of the biomass was in the surface scum starting from day 2 of the experiment coalescence of smaller colonies into larger aggregates in the surface layer was apparently an important mechanism during the scum formation recent experiments have demonstrated that this aggregation is facilitated by increased amounts of extracellular polymeric substances in colony aggregations xiao et al 2018 xu et al 2014 wind stress applied to the water surface reduced the size of the aggregations at the water surface to colonies 2 mm which were partly entrained into the bulk water the maximum wind speed of 3 6 m s 1 in our experiment was sufficient to homogenize the colony size distributions at the water surface and in the bulk water but did not result in a complete mixing of the microcystis biomass this result is consistent with field and remote sensing observations from lakes and reservoirs where local surface concentrations of cyanobacteria only appeared at wind speeds below 3 4 m s 1 cao et al 2006 george and edwards 1976 qi et al 2018 the vertical distribution of wind shear near the water surface is characterized by a viscous sublayer at the air water interface where turbulent motions are suppressed and a turbulent boundary layer below lorke and peeters 2006 the thickness of the viscous sublayer is reciprocally related to wind speed webster and hutchinson 1994 and for a wind speed of 3 6 m s 1 its thickness is approximately 2 mm which is comparable to the thickness of the observed scum layer in our experiments 3 mm consistent with the maximum colony sizes observed at high wind speeds in our experiments floating microcystis colonies or colony aggregation smaller than 2 mm were immersed in the surface viscous boundary layer webster and hutchinson 1994 proposed a trapping mechanism of colonies in the viscous sublayer where colonies in the bulk water are transported upward by turbulent eddies and stick to the viscous sublayer at the air water interface although we did not observe the initial development of the surface scum layer during the night between day 1 and 2 we speculate that the weak steady wind 1 4 m s 1 ultimately promoted the rapid initial microcystis scum formation in our experiments fig 2 although we measured the vertical velocity component of individual microcystis colonies buoyancy controlled floatation or sinking velocities could not be resolved we attribute this to the water motion which in the absence of wind forcing was driven by convection the residual flow velocity fluctuations in the absence of wind forcing of a few mm s 1 are exceeding expected floatation velocities of microcystis colonies nakamura et al 1993 rowe et al 2016 by about one order of magnitude the existence of large scale convective flow structures and secondary circulation at low wind can result in persistent local up and downwelling flows within the field of view of the camera which probably impede estimation of size dependent colony floatation velocities also from longer term averaging and prolonged measurements laboratory measurements of buoyancy controlled colony motion have typically been done in narrow settling columns where water motion is suppressed by the small size of the chamber and better thermal insulation although the lack of completely stagnant conditions can be considered as a shortcoming of our experimental approach it can be expected that such slow water motion are ubiquitously present in most environmental systems a combination of annular flumes with separate estimates of buoyant colony velocities in settling chambers can potentially provide insight into the relative role of colony buoyancy and surface trapping in the viscous sublayer at low wind speed further research into this direction appears important as current approaches for modeling and predicting microcystis bloom and scum formation consider buoyancy and turbulent mixing as the major regulating processes aparicio et al 2013 wang et al 2017 yang and kong 2013 4 2 effect of microcystis on turbulence generation by wind another important finding from our experiment was the unexpectedly strong reduction of momentum transfer from wind to water by the presence of the microcystis scum layer the threshold in wind speed for the onset of water motion increased and the flow velocity generated by each applied wind speed decreased with increasing scum development these observations reveal a stabilizing feedback mechanism between the scum layer and its physical environment by counteracting wind generated mixing and dispersion at low wind speeds two possible mechanisms can cause the reduction in momentum transfer from wind to water by the submerged scum layer the presence of a film of surface active material i e a surface microlayer or a change of viscosity of the water due to the presence of the scum layer by examining the bulk fluid properties of dense microcystis aggregations dervaux et al 2015 observed yield stress i e more solid behavior of the bacterial suspension at low shear rates where viscosity increased by three orders of magnitude if a critical shear rate was exceeded the suspension showed newtonian behavior with viscosity very close to that of water the authors ascribed these observations to the stabilizing effect of extracellular polymeric substances which provide the observed yield strength at low shear rates the critical shear rate 10 s 1 and corresponding viscosity 1 1 mpa s reported by dervaux et al 2015 suggest a critical shear stress of 10 2 pa which corresponds to a wind speed of about 2 9 m s 1 at lower wind speed the increased viscosity of the scum layer can therefore suppress turbulent motions in a vertically extended viscous sublayer consistent with our observations the large extent of the viscous sublayer in dense microcystis aggregations provides a potential mechanism for the increased threshold for wind generated mixing at low and medium wind speed the change in viscosity however would mainly result in a changing vertical distribution of wind generated flow velocity while the shear stress at the air water interface and thereby the total momentum transfer from air to water would remain unaffected the momentum transfer from wind to water is controlled by water surface roughness which at low wind speed is predominantly affected by water surface tension wind ripples and capillary waves the microcystis scum layer in our experiments was fully submerged and presence of the scum layer could not have affected the surface properties directly however films of surface active substances can form due to secretion of plankton lancelot and mathot 1987 although water surface tension was not included in our measurements we tested this hypothesis by performing additional measurements after the main experiment this preliminary test indicated a pronounced reduction of water surface tension up to 20 in the presence of microcystis colonies fig s6 although surface films have not yet been linked to surface scum formation in lakes and other inland waters biogenic surface microlayers surface slicks or films have been receiving increased scientific interests because of their potential importance for gas exchange biogeochemical cycling accumulation of pollutants and last but not least as a unique habitat for specialized organisms i e floating plankton cunliffe et al 2013 södergren 1987 similar to oil films these layers damp capillary waves alpers and hühnerfuss 1989 tempel and riet 1965 and therewith reduce the water surface roughness at low wind speed the reduced roughness causes a reduction in momentum transfer from wind to water wüest and lorke 2003 the reduction of water surface tension by a surfactant film excreted as or along with other extracellular polymeric substances by microcystis colonies may constitute an important process by which the scum forming bacteria affect their physical environment towards more favorable conditions 5 conclusions for the first time we analysed the formation and persistence of a microcystis scum layer under wind generated turbulence in controlled laboratory experiments our experiments revealed two important physical processes occurring at the water surface at low wind speed that may have been overlooked in former laboratory studies as well as in field assessments the strong velocity gradient within the viscous sublayer at the air water interface potentially promotes the growth of the scum layer by the trapping of colonies from the wind stirred bulk water below at high wind speed reduction of viscous sublayer thickness lead to erosion of the scum layer and entrainment of large colonies into the bulk water we further found experimental evidence for a strong suppression of momentum transfer from wind to water by the presence of the surface scum layer or by surface active material excreted by the microcystis cells the developing scum layer caused an increasing reduction of wind generated flow and turbulence and thus provided a stabilizing feedback mechanism of the surface bloom with its physical environment small scale turbulence and the microlayer at the water surface potentially play an important yet largely unexplored role in microcystis surface scum development in water bodies future studies should analyze the interactions of microcystis blooms with the water surface at greater detail particularly by including observations of the surface microlayer water surface tension and viscosity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no
