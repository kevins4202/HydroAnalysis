15710,viral indicators of human fecal contamination in wastewaters and environmental waters have been getting much attention in the past decade cross assembly phage crassphage is the most abundant dna virus in human feces recently the usefulness of crassphage as a microbial source tracking and water quality monitoring tool for human fecal contamination has been highlighted here we conducted a comprehensive review on crassphage in water focusing on detection methodology concentration range in various waters and wastewaters specificity to human fecal contamination and reduction in wastewater treatment systems this review highlights that crassphage is globally distributed in wastewaters and various fecal contaminated water bodies at high concentrations without seasonal fluctuations crassphage is highly specific to human fecal contamination and is rarely found in animal feces it also has a good potential as a performance indicator to ensure virus reduction in wastewater treatment systems accordingly crassphage could be an effective tool for monitoring of human fecal contamination and potential presence of fecal pathogenic microbes in environmental waters bridging the research gaps highlighted in this review would make crassphage a powerful tool to support the control of water related health risks graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fecal indicator

used for the research described in the article 1 introduction enteric viruses are the main cause of gastroenteritis which costs billions of dollars in healthcare each year farkas et al 2019 stachler et al 2018 waterborne gastroenteritis has been estimated to cause 3 4 million deaths per year worldwide who 2014 sewage contaminated water is predicted to be the major cause of these infections who 2014 ramani and kang 2009 viruses can enter aquatic environments not only through poorly treated or untreated wastewater bibby et al 2019 okoh et al 2010 but also from the effluent of wastewater treatment systems carducci et al 2009 schmitz et al 2016 the widely used fecal indicator bacteria fib do not mimic the dynamics of viral pathogens such as transportation and decay in water environment and wastewater treatment kitajima et al 2014 qiu et al 2015 sidhu et al 2018 therefore direct monitoring of viruses is necessary to control of such pathogenic viruses in recreational and drinking water systems cross assembly phage crassphage has recently been discovered via viral metagenomic analysis which has enabled the discovery of unculturable viruses stachler and bibby 2014 found that crassphage is highly abundant in sewage and is not detected in most animal feces thus they concluded that crassphage can be applied as a microbial source tracking mst marker to track sewage pollution in environmental water bodies recent studies have also reported the high abundance of crassphage and stronger correlations of crassphage with enteric viruses than other fecal markers ballesté et al 2019 farkas et al 2019 malla et al 2019b stachler et al 2018 wu et al 2020 the newly discovered crassphage has great potentials for a broad range of applications in fecal virus monitoring as well as mst in environmental waters and wastewater treatment which may circumvent the shortcomings in the existing methodologies of virus monitoring and control this review summarizes the up to date knowledge on crassphage in water engineering and the potential application of crassphage as a human fecal virus indicator and mst marker this review highlights the quantification methodology abundance in various waters reduction in wastewater treatment systems sensitivity and specificity to human fecal contamination and comparison with other currently available viral indicators this review aims to help researchers and water engineers who work on fecal virus pollution in water environments and to facilitate the application of crassphage in the field of water environment studies 2 basics of crassphage crassphage is a recently discovered bacteriophage from human gut metagenomic data dutilh et al 2014 crassphage was named after metagenomic sequence data processing cross assembly the technique whereby this bacteriophage was discovered dutilh et al 2014 it belongs to the family of crass like phages which infect bacteroides species gut commensal bacteria to date the crass like phages have four subfamilies and 10 candidate genera guerin et al 2018 several crass like phages have been isolated from human feces and found to infect bacteroides for example φcrass001 was found to infect bacteroides intestinalis shkoporov et al 2018 φcrass002 infects bacteroides xylanisolvens guerin et al 2021 dac15 and dac17 infect bacteroides thetaiotaomicron hryckowian et al 2020 furthermore crass like phages are also found in termite guts cat non human primates groundwaters and oceanic environments li et al 2021a cinek et al 2018 holmfeldt et al 2013 yutin et al 2018 among the crass like bacteriophages crassphage has recently been proposed as a biomarker for human fecal contamination since it is entirely associated with the human gut microbiome ahmed et al 2018a edwards et al 2019 farkas et al 2019 yutin et al 2018 the crassphage genome consists of 97 kbp double stranded dna dsdna and is prevalent in available us gut metagenomic data dutilh et al 2014 honap et al 2020 crassphage is the most abundant human associated virus found in approximately 50 of human gut viromes koonin and yutin 2020 additionally crassphage is 6 times more abundant than any other known bacteriophage and thus could be reconstructed from the available metagenomes dutilh et al 2014 the latest study indicates that crassphage can be present in the guts of one month old infants tamburini et al 2018 in line with the fact that bacteroides are the most abundant in the gut microbiome of newborns bäckhed et al 2015 additionally it has been suggested that a single crassphage strain present in the gut of most adults tamburini et al 2018 although some adults can have even hundreds of multiple strains edwards et al 2019 the prevalence of crassphage in different environmental reservoirs has recently been explored ahmed et al 2021a kongprajug et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 crassphage is abundantly present in environments with human fecal pollution garcía aljaro et al 2017 and can be easily detected via polymerase chain reaction pcr based assays however further investigation is necessary to explore genotype distribution of crassphage and environmental dynamics of these genotypes honap et al 2020 koonin and yutin 2020 shkoporov et al 2018 sommers et al 2021 in addition crassphage relation to pathogenic viruses can help to define the fate in environment 3 measurement of crassphage in wastewater and environmental waters to detect and quantify the crassphage in water quantitative pcr qpcr is generally used a taqman based qpcr assay for crassphage has been developed stachler et al 2017 among the 384 primer sets designed from a meta consensus genome stachler et al reported two novel qpcr assays for crassphage cpq 056 and cpq 064 which could quantitatively evaluate the viral discharge from sewage into water bodies to date several types of pcr primer and probe sets have been developed for crassphage table 1 another taqman based qpcr assay kp06 gp31 gene has been developed and applied to detect crassphage in wastewater garcía aljaro et al 2017 among the taqman qpcr assays developed so far cpq 056 and cpq 064 have been widely used for quantification of crassphage in stool surface water wastewater storm drain outfall river water treated drinking water and sediments ahmed et al 2021a 2019a 2018a 2018b farkas et al 2019 jennings et al 2020 kongprajug et al 2019 sangkaew et al 2021 stachler et al 2018 2017 tandukar et al 2020a 2020b wu et al 2020 the detection efficiency in wastewater has been reported to be 100 for either cpq 056 or cpq 064 assay when 1 10 2 ng of total dna is used as the template dna while the efficiency was reported 45 and 53 for cpq 056 and cpq 064 respectively when 1 10 3 ng dna is used stachler et al 2017 another crassphage assay of kp06 gp31 also reportedly showed 100 of detection efficiency among 23 samples of municipal wastewater garcía aljaro et al 2017 limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq depend on the efficiency in sample processing i e virus concentration and nucleotide extraction and in qpcr detection ahmed et al 2018a 2018b defined the assay lod alod in qpcr as the lowest number of the target gene copies detected in 2 3 of qpcr replicates the same authors estimated the alods of cpq 056 and cpq 064 to be three gene copies gc reaction ahmed et al 2018a 2018b 2021b the limits of detection and quantification can be affected by any pcr inhibitor that may be present in the water sample dilution of the template sometimes enhances sensitivity in such cases ahmed et al 2018b primary concentration of viruses is often recommended to enhance detection sensitivity in qpcr assays concentration methods that are typically used for other enteric viruses in environmental waters are applicable to crassphage there are very few studies that have checked the recovery rate of crassphage and it still needs to be explored no method is fully optimized for crassphage concentration however popularly used methods for primary concentration of crassphage in water are i microfiltration mf ii electrostatic adsorption often known as electronegative membrane or electropositive membrane enm epm method iii ultrafiltration uf iv ultracentrifuge and v polyethylene glycol peg precipitation the most popular method to concentrate the crassphage in these types of water samples is the enm method ahmed et al 2018b 2019b jennings et al 2020 kongprajug et al 2019 malla et al 2019a 2019b sala comorera et al 2021 sangkaew et al 2021 tandukar et al 2020a stachler et al 2018 2019 wu et al 2020 to enhance detection sensitivity the enm epm methods are often followed by a secondary concentration via uf malla et al 2019b morrison et al 2020 stachler et al 2017 ward et al 2020 or peg precipitation farkas et al 2019 mf methods have been also used for primary concentration of the crassphage in various water samples including untreated and treated wastewater surface water and seawater ballesté et al 2019 sangkaew et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 in the mf method viral particles adhering on suspended solids are captured on a membrane filter with 0 2 µm or 0 45 µm pore size free viral particles in the liquid fraction are not collected since the pore size of the membrane is larger than viral particles the electrostatic adsorption method which is often known as the enm epm method is popularly utilized to concentrate crassphage ahmed et al 2018b jennings et al 2020 malla et al 2019a 2019b ward et al 2020 sangkaew et al 2021 stachler et al 2018 wu et al 2020 tandukar et al 2020a 2020b most enteric viruses have protein capsids which have positive electrostatic charge under the acidic condition or negative charge under the neutral to base condition first viruses in a water sample are adsorbed by electrostatic coupling to a charged membrane in the enm method a sample is pre acidified to make viral particles positively charged or the membrane was preconditioned with divalent mg2 solution ikner et al 2012 michen and graule 2010 the adsorbed viruses are often eluted and collected by decoupling the electrostatic bond with a basic buffer in the enm method or with an acidic buffer in the epm method where viral protein capsid is turned to have charges repulsive to the membrane otherwise the membrane filter adsorbing viruses is sometimes directly subject to dna extraction the sample volume for detection of enteric viruses by mf and enm epm methods depends on the sample type and the objective of the study the advantage of the enm epm methods is applicability to a large sample volume e g up to 5 l for a sample with low turbidity the drawback is the necessity of turbidity removal for a highly turbid sample prior to application to prevent clogging of the membrane filter the sample size is often chosen as the maximum volume to avoid clogging the membrane or multiple membranes can be utilized if the sample is very turbid the typical volume of the virus concentrate in the enm epm methods is 5 15 ml the viral nucleotide can be also extracted directly from the membrane without elution by using bead beating extraction jennings et al 2020 in addition secondary concentration by using uf is sometimes applied after the enm epm method if the crassphage concentration is expected to be low or other enteric viruses are also targeted in the uf viruses are concentrated by size exclusion with uf membrane filter which typically has a 10 100 kda molecular weight cut off mwco cashdollar and wymer 2013 hill et al 2005 ultrafiltration centrifugal units are also often used for virus concentration ahmed et al 2020a ikner et al 2011 malla et al 2019a symonds et al 2009 tandukar et al 2020a amicon ultra 15 centrifugal unit can rapidly process 15 ml whereas centricon plus 70 can process 70 ml at a time with a 3 100 kda mwco membrane filter the typical volume of the concentrate after ultrafiltration is 200 700 µl which is ready for dna extraction uf for secondary concentration can recover 17 83 of enteric viruses ikner et al 2011 the drawbacks of these centrifugal units are relatively high cost concentration of viruses only from liquid fractions and simultaneous concentration of pcr inhibitors ultracentrifugation concentrates viral particles in a water sample through high speed centrifugation at 100 000 g for 1 4 h fumian et al 2010b ikner et al 2012 however the high initial cost of an ultracentrifuge machine and small processing volumes 10 ml 1 l may discourage the usage of this concentration method for water samples the peg precipitation method concentrates eluted viruses via precipitation at a high ionic concentration and neutral ph the advantage of this method is minimal contamination with other organic materials that may inhibit pcr lewis and metcalf 1988 the peg reagents with a molecular weight of 6 kda 20 kda are popularly used for this method generally samples of 40 ml 1 l from water matrices can be subjected to concentration ahmed et al 2020a gyawali et al 2019 hata et al 2021 hewitt et al 2011 mull and hill 2012 torii et al 2022 viruses in a water sample are concentrated by adding 8 16 w v of peg and 2 4 w v of nacl then incubating at 4 c for 2 h to overnight the virus concentrate is collected by centrifuge the advantage of the peg precipitation method is the reasonable cost and processing without any special skills or equipment needed but its drawback is its inapplicability to large volume samples along with any of these concentration steps process control is required to identify the efficiency and any failure in sample processing and detection haramoto et al 2018 detection efficiency of process control incorporates loss of viral dna in sample processing steps and low pcr efficiency due to inhibitors in wastewaters and environmental waters sufficient sample volume is important to detect and quantify the crassphage in environmental waters the appropriate sample volume depends on the expected concentration of crassphage which is speculated by the type of water such as untreated wastewater treated wastewater surface water etc described in detail in the next section and the extent of human fecal pollution the required sample volume restricts the selection of primary concentration methods the typical sample volume of untreated wastewater required for quantification of crassphage is 100 µl 200 ml to quantitate the crassphage in untreated wastewater the mf and enm epm methods are often applied for virus concentration ballesté et al 2019 jennings et al 2020 malla et al 2019a sala comorera et al 2021 tandukar et al 2020a direct dna extraction with no concentration step is also sometimes applicable ahmed et al 2021a 2021b 2019b for secondary treated wastewater or effluent of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp 500 ml 2 l sample volume is required farkas et al 2019 kongprajug et al 2019 morrison et al 2020 sangkaew et al 2021 wu et al 2020 the sample volume of surface waters with human fecal pollution should be 50 ml 2 l depending on the extent of the pollution ahmed et al 2018a farkas et al 2019 jennings et al 2020 malla et al 2019b sangkaew et al 2021 stachler et al 2017 ward et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 when a slight impact of human feces is expected in the water e g spring water and storm water a 500 ml 2 l sample volume is needed ahmed et al 2018a 2018b sangkaew et al 2021 stachler et al 2018 for sediments impacted by fecal pollution a 5 10 g sample has been reported to be enough for direct detection of crassphage with no concentration step ahmed et al 2020b or virus elution followed by peg precipitation farkas et al 2019 polo et al 2021 crassphage could be detected from 1 l of groundwater sample processed with the enm method malla et al 2019b and 10 l of seawater sample processed by the mf method sangkaew et al 2021 the selection of the concentration method is the key to enhancing detection efficiency and sensitivity the appropriate method should be chosen by considering the water type expected level of human fecal contamination available sample volume as well as available laboratory resources 4 presence of crassphage in wastewater and aquatic environments the prevalence of crassphage in various aquatic environments including untreated and treated wastewaters stormwater rivers sediments and wastewater contaminated streams has been investigated ahmed et al 2018a 2018b farkas et al 2019 garcía aljaro et al 2017 stachler et al 2018 crassphage is present constantly in municipal wastewater in untreated wastewater crassphage concentration is 4 8 12 0 log10 gc l in most countries table 2 a the reported maximum concentration in untreated wastewater is 11 0 12 0 log10 gc l in japan malla et al 2019a the crassphage concentration in untreated wastewater is 7 4 10 0 log10 gc l in the high income countries hic of the usa the uk australia new zealand and spain but in the range of 4 8 8 2 log10 gc l in other asian countries of thailand and china ahmed et al 2018a 2019b 2018b 2021b cuevas ferrando et al 2022 farkas et al 2019 garcía aljaro et al 2017 gyawali et al 2021 kongprajug et al 2019 papp et al 2020 sangkaew et al 2021 tandukar et al 2020a b wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 although the reported range of crassphage concentration varies by region the constant presence of crassphage in influent wastewater is reported worldwide detection efficiency in influent has been reported in 100 of 32 samples in the usa ahmed et al 2018a tandukar et al 2020a wu et al 2020 of 26 samples in australia ahmed et al 2021a 2019a 2019b 2018b 2021b of 23 samples in spain garcía aljaro et al 2017 of 49 samples in the uk farkas et al 2019 and of 68 samples in thailand kongprajug et al 2019 sangkaew et al 2021 in italy 96 of 156 influent samples tested positive crank et al 2020 accordingly crassphage is highly likely to be present at high concentrations in most influent wastewater in any country the variation in crassphage concentration among different regions may be due to differences in urbanization level climate conditions and the impact of diet on the gut microbiome honap et al 2020 kau et al 2011 stachler and bibby 2014 in treated wastewater crassphage has been detected in the concentration range of 4 8 8 6 log10 gc l table 2 a the mean concentration of crassphage detected in treated effluent was 6 5 log10 gc l in hic ballesté et al 2019 farkas et al 2019 gyawali et al 2021 morrison et al 2020 tandukar sherchan and haramoto 2020a b wu et al 2020 the constant presence of crassphage in treated wastewater has also been reported by year long monitoring studies detection ratios in secondary treated effluent and disinfected final effluent have been reported to be 100 13 13 and 85 11 13 respectively in 1 year monthly monitoring at wwtps tandukar et al 2020a ballesté et al 2019 reported 100 11 11 detection with no seasonal variability upon 2 year monitoring at a wwtp and inter comparison of 18 wwtps the overall log reduction values lrvs of crassphage in wwtps is 1 0 2 9 log10 table 2 a the median lrv from our literature review was 1 6 log10 fig 1 the lrv at wwtp varies dependent on process configuration the lrvs by the conventional activated sludge cas process mostly ranged between 1 8 and 2 5 log10 farkas et al 2019 gyawali et al 2021 kongprajug et al 2019 sangkaew et al 2021 tandukar et al 2020a wu et al 2020 however the highest lrv by cas reported to date was 3 3 1 0 log10 tandukar et al 2020a while the lowest lrv by cas is reported 1 0 2 0 log10 farkas et al 2019 tandukar et al 2020a a membrane bioreactor mbr process reported to have better lrvs of crassphage than cas as generally reported with other viruses crasphage in mbr permeates was below the loq of 120 gc l papp et al 2020 the estimated lrvs by mbr were 6 0 log10 on the other hand biofilter treatment process showed 1 0 log10 reduction without disinfection farkas et al 2019 chlorination after secondary treatment is reported to have no reduction to maximum 0 7 log10 tandukar et al 2020a b wu et al 2020 however it should be noted that pcr assay would detect the remaining viral genes even though the virus is inactivated in the course of wastewater treatment including chlorination therefore reduction of intact viruses could be higher than lrv of the viral gene markers sano et al 2010 there are still a limited number of studies on reduction of crassphage in wastewater treatment reduction of crassphage is likely to depend on treatment process so far its reduction was mostly studied in cas process further investigation on reduction of crassphage in other secondary processes is needed to understand for effect of operational conditions and quantitative relation with reduction of enteric viruses crassphage is reportedly often detected in environmental waters receiving human fecal pollution the detected concentration range of crassphage in rivers is 2 6 9 0 log10 gc l ballesté et al 2019 farkas et al 2019 jennings et al 2020 kongprajug et al 2019 malla et al 2019a 2019b stachler et al 2017 ward et al 2020 table 2 b in highly polluted rivers crassphage is generally found at persistently high concentrations and has no seasonal variation in rivers with low pollution crassphage is found at relatively lower concentrations with a large variation based on the season the upstream sites of rivers surrounded by low density rural housing mostly recorded no detection whereas downstream regions often had the maximum detection of crassphage jennings et al 2020 ward et al 2020 climate conditions are also the impact factor on crassphage concentration in rivers precipitation positively correlated with the concentration of crassphage in rivers due to increased loading from stormwater wwtp effluent diffuse pollution originating from septic tanks and sediments mobilization ballesté et al 2019 stachler et al 2018 temperature reportedly has a strongly negative correlation with crassphage concentration ballesté et al 2019 it is probably because viral dna tends to decrease more rapidly in summer due to higher temperature and higher irradiation crassphage is often detected in water bodies receiving urban stormwater runoff urban drainage affected by the combined sewer overflows csos showed high concentration of crassphage at 5 0 7 0 log10 gc l stachler et al 2018 ahmed et al 2018a reported an increase in detection ratio at stormwater drain under wet weather conditions suggesting that discharge of human fecal pollution in stormwater runoff increase in concentration and detection ratio of crassphage under wet weather conditions has also been reported in stream and lake water receiving csos ahmed et al 2019b 2018b in the lake affected by cso 97 100 of the samples contained up to 7 0 log10 gc l under wet weather whereas only 20 of the samples showed detection at lower concentrations than 3 0 log10 gc l under dry weather ahmed et al 2019b 2018b stachler et al 2018 2019 crassphage has been detected with a range of 4 3 8 3 log10 in the sediments of contaminated rivers gc g ballesté et al 2019 farkas et al 2019 generally the detection efficiency of crassphage was over 90 in water bodies with human fecal pollution suggesting the usefulness of crassphage for detection of viral contamination by municipal wastewater sources in aquatic environment high correlations of crassphage with the other fecal indictors have been reported in municipal wastewater and aquatic environment with human fecal pollution a study in urban stream impacted by combined sewer overflows reported the cpq 064 assay strongly correlated with fecal indicator escherichia coli e coli and enterococci while cpq 056 assay correlated strongly with somatic coliphage stachler et al 2018 another study reported that kp06 gp31 assay had statistically significant correlations both with e coli and somatic coliphages in effluents of 18 wwtps and downstream river water samples balleste et al 2019 in contrast crassphage reportedly had low correlations with e coli in wastewater of animal origin crassphage by kp06 gp31 assay in cow poutry and porcine wastewater was detected at much lower than in human origin wastewater although quite high concentrations of e coli were observed in all types of wastewater garcia aljaro et al 2017 the average log ratio of crassphage to e coli was 1 7 log10 in human origin wastewater while it was 1 5 log10 in wastewater of animal origin these studies demostrated that crassphage could detect human fecal contamination specifically while e coli can detect broader fecal contamination of both human and animal origin persistence in environmental waters is also an advantage of using crassphage as a contamination indicator although its decay depends on temperature ballesté et al 2019 first order decay rate constants k are reported 0 1365 d 1 9 1 d for 90 reduction at 25 c k 0 05 d 1 27 5 d for 90 reduction at 15 c ahmed et al 2021b ballesté et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 decay of crassphage in environment is also affected by ultraviolet intensity from sunlight crassphage in lake waters is reportedly more persistent near the bottom than near the surface ahmed et al 2018b furthermore crassphage showed slower inactivation than bacterial fecal indicators greaves et al 2020 and quantifiable for longer period of time than human pelyomavirus hpyv and human adenovirus hadv ahmed et al 2019c this demonstrates that crassphage can represent viral fate effectively of the sewage contaminated water as compared to fib overall crassphage has been widely detected in wastewater and water bodies affected by human fecal contamination however few studies have been conducted so far in groundwater environments crassphage could be useful to track distribution of human enteric viruses through groundwater flows these types of studies will be helpful in evaluating the use of crassphage as an indicator tool 5 application as a human fecal indicator and microbial source tracking marker crassphage is a promising human fecal indicator and mst marker of human fecal contamination this bacteriophage has the following advantages as a human fecal indicator over other phage indicators i the concentration of the human gut associated crassphage in sewage is higher than that of other phage or enteric viruses bivins et al 2020 edwards et al 2019 ii crassphage has a close relation to other human viral pathogens in wastewater treatment systems such as hpyv and hadv crank et al 2020 wu et al 2020 and iii crassphage has strong durability to environmental stress than fib wu et al 2020 these characteristics satisfy the bonde s criteria for an ideal indicator of waterborne pathogens which includes to i be present whenever the pathogens are present ii occur in much greater numbers than pathogens and iii be more resistant to disinfectants and to the aqueous environment than the pathogens nasem 2004 therefore crassphage is potentially a good human fecal indicator with high sensitivity which is broadly detectable and reflects human fecal pollution in environmental waters the high abundance of crassphage in sewage has been reported in various countries in europe usa africa and asia edwards et al 2019 stachler and bibby 2014 hence application of crassphage as a mst marker for human fecal source has been investigated worldwide including the usa ahmed et al 2018a stachler et al 2018 chile jennings et al 2020 the uk farkas et al 2019 italy crank et al 2020 spain garcía aljaro et al 2017 australia ahmed et al 2018b japan malla et al 2019a thailand kongprajug et al 2019 and nepal malla et al 2019b the superior performance and suitability of crassphage versus other human specific viral markers for human fecal source tracking have recently been reported based on metagenomic data sets chen et al 2021 an important advantage of crassphage as a fecal indicator is high specificity to human fecal contamination it could be detected in some of animal feces however its concentrations are often lower in non human sources than in human and sewage sources most of studies reported detection of crassphage is highly related to human feces with limited cross reactivity to other animal feces e g poultry swine and cats ahmed et al 2018a 2018b jennings et al 2020 kongprajug et al 2019 host specificity and sensitivity are the key factors for a suitable mst marker ahmed et al 2018b host specificity is the proportion of negative results produced by non target host fecal samples whereas sensitivity is the proportion of positives in the targeted host samples among the various crassphage markers developed so far table 1 cpq 056 and cpq 064 are popularly used in mst studies these crassphage markers reportedly have high sensitivity and specificity to the human fecal contamination in environmental waters cpq 056 and cpq 064 primer sets have shown 100 of sensitivity and detection in sewage samples in many studies ahmed et al 2019a 2018a 2018b kongprajug et al 2020 sangkaew et al 2021 stachler et al 2017 the overall sensitivity and specificity of crassphage based on cpq 056 and cpq 064 in comparison with those of other mst markers are shown in fig 2 the mean sensitivity and specificity of crassphage to human feces were 92 and 93 respectively in the reported studies fig 2 ahmed et al 2019a 2018b kongprajug et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 although the sensitivity of pepper mild mottle virus pmmov marker is also reportedly 100 its specificity has a larger variability than that of crassphage markers fig 2 hadv and hpyv markers exhibited 100 of host specificity although they have been reported to have larger variations of sensitivity and lower detected concentrations 2 1 5 7 log10 gc l depending on the illness rates in the community elmahdy et al 2020 among 23 tested animal feces 17 showed no cross reactivity with cpq 056 and cpq 064 markers while cross reactivity was observed with cat dog duck gull pig and rabbit feces fig 3 although cross reactivity was found in some animals crassphage was not always detected in the feces of these animal feces the positive ratios of cpq 056 were 22 4 in cats 13 58 10 2 in dogs 12 118 28 0 in ducks 14 50 11 4 in gulls 4 35 20 0 in rabbits 8 40 and 9 20 in pigs 22 239 while cpq 064 was detected in 32 3 of cats 10 31 1 20 of dogs 1 83 20 6 of pigs 20 97 37 1 of ducks 13 35 and 24 2 of rabbits 8 33 moreover crassphage shedding in animal feces is 2 4 log10 lower than shedding in human feces fig 3 shedding of crassphage in human feces has been reported to be 4 2 8 9 log10 gc g ahmed et al 2019a 2018b zhang et al 2020 among companion animals dogs and rabbits shed 2 7 3 3 log10 gc g feces whereas cats have highly variable shedding of 4 8 8 6 log10 gc g ahmed et al 2019a 2018b gyawali et al 2021 stachler et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 feedstock animals such as cows pigs gulls and ducks shed 2 9 4 1 log10 gc g ahmed et al 2018b gyawali et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 although the positive ratio among individual animal feces is low it might be detected more frequently in wastewater which is discharged from a large population of animals so far there are the limited number of studies which investigated crassphage in animal wastewater malla et al 2019 ahmed et al 2018b garcia aljaro et al 2017 while the positive ratio of crassphage was 100 in municipal wastewater in all the studies most of animal wastewater had lower positive ratios the positive ratio in cattle wastewater was reportedly 17 2 12 with both of cpq 056 and cpq 064 ahmed et al 2018b in pig wastewater 100 3 3 with cpq 056 malla et al 2019 and 0 0 12 with cpq 056 and cpq 064 ahmed et al 2018b garcia aljaro et al 2017 reported the positive ratio of kp06 gp31 was 61 25 41 of total 41 livestock wastewater samples which was composed of 12 cattle wastewater samples from 4 slaughter houses 15 pig wastewater samples from 4 abattoirs and 14 poultry wastewater samples from 2 slaughter houses more importantly the crassphage concentrations detected in animal wastewater were much lower than in human wastewater the detected concentrations of cpq 056 and cpq 064 in cattle and pig wastewater were approximately 2 to 4 log10 lower than in municipal wastewater malla et al 2019 ahmed et al 2018b whereas the average detected concentrations of kp06 gp31 in livestock wastewater was lower by 2 log10 than municipal wastewater garcia aljaro et al 2017 although crassphage can be detected in some animal wastewater it is mostly present at a much lower concentration than in wastewater of human fecal origin the cross reactivity in animals varies by locality too cross reactivity with cat feces has been reported in some studies in us australia and new zealand but not in china li et al 2021a zhang et al 2020 ahmed et al 2019a 2018b gyawali et al 2021 in chile no cross reactivity has been observed with dogs whereas cross reactivity with ducks has been observed only in china jennings et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 in thailand cross reactivity has been detected only in a swine composite fecal sample 1 39 composite samples not in cattle chicken duck goat and sheep kongprajug et al 2019 sangkaew et al 2021 another crassphage marker kp06 gp31 reportedly indicated 41 of cross reactivity among 41 slurry wastewater samples of cow pigs and poultry however the detected concentrations were lower by 1 5 3 5 log10 than municipal wastewater garcía aljaro et al 2017 moreover this marker has not been detected in dog or gull feces sala comorera et al 2021 the specificity of the kp06 gp31 marker possibly has geographic dependence a recent comprehensive study has reported that this marker indicated 100 of specificity in germany austria and finland ballesté et al 2021 although the specificity was low in portugal 38 and spain 10 the detected concentrations in livestock wastewater were at least 1 log10 lower than in municipal wastewater the high host specificity and sensitivity of crassphage markers suggest that these markers are suitable as the human fecal indicators in environmental waters although their sensitivity and specificity reportedly depend on locality it is recommended to confirm their sensitivity and specificity with reference samples to choose the appropriate marker in the target area among the crassphage markers cpq 056 and cpq 064 are highly specific and sensitive human fecal indicators cats show the highest cross reactivity and the largest fecal shedding among animals however the positive ratios in cat feces are still lower than those in human feces although the detected range of shedding is similar to that in humans since the human population in most communities is much larger than the cat population detection of crassphage in environmental waters is often likely to indicate the presence of human fecal sources the high cross reactivity with cats might be due to the presence of homolog genes or related sequences in microorganisms in animals ahmed et al 2019a shanks et al 2008 stachler et al 2018 assay optimization such as combination of two crassphage markers would be effective to enhance specificity to human fecal sources in comparison to crassphage pmmov is another promising human fecal indicator and mst marker the typical concentration of pmmov reported in untreated wastewater ranges from 6 to 10 log10 gc l gyawali et al 2019 hamza et al 2011 kitajima et al 2014 kuroda et al 2015 rosario et al 2009 schmitz et al 2016 the abundance of pmmov is high in wastewater and feces where pepper products are consumed symonds et al 2018 however one of the limitations of pmmov compared to crassphage is that pmmov cannot be used as a fecal indicator near pepper cultivation areas because bell and chili peppers are the primary source of this virus although pmmov has shown high sensitivity to human feces by qpcr assay its specificity is limited to 48 2 90 0 which is lower than crassphage gyawali et al 2019 hamza et al 2011 malla et al 2019b rosario et al 2009 symonds et al 2018 cross reaction of pmmov is reported with feces of more animals than crassphage such as black swan cow chicken dog duck geese seagull and pig malla et al 2019b rosario et al 2009 symonds et al 2018 hpyv and hadv have also been proposed as indicators for human sewage contamination due to their host specificity albinana gimenez et al 2009 bofill mas et al 2006 2000 hewitt et al 2013 pina et al 1998 among the members of hpyvs the abundance of jc polyomavirus jcpyv is much more than that of bk polyomavirus bkpyv or merkel cell polyomavirus mcpyv in wastewater and lies in ranges of 3 to 8 log10 gc l bofill mas et al 2006 farkas et al 2018b fumian et al 2010a kitajima et al 2014 levican et al 2019 rusiñol et al 2015 schmitz et al 2016 typical concentration ranges of hadv are reported as 1 to 10 log10 gc l assis et al 2017 bofill mas et al 2006 carducci and verani 2013 elmahdy et al 2019 farkas et al 2018a hamza et al 2009 la rosa et al 2010 sidhu et al 2017 simmons et al 2011 both are highly specific to humans and prevalent in various environmental water matrices the drawback of hpyv and hadv is that their concentration depends on infected population in a community detection sensitivity of hpyv and hadv varies depending on not only fecal contamination but also infected population hence crassphage is more suitable to quantify fecal contamination level than hpyv and hadv because crassphage is abundant in most of population and directly reflects their fecal discharge presence of crassphage in environmental waters is often associated with other microbes of health concern e g pathogenic viruses and antimicrobial resistance correlations of crassphage with norovirus hpyv e coli and enterococci have been reported in environmental waters with human fecal pollution jennings et al 2020 stachler et al 2018 in an urban river affected by wwtp effluents crassphage by cpq 064 assay indicated strong correlations with norovirus gii particularly when norovirus were detected while it had low correlation with enterococci jennings et al 2020 another study in urban stream affected by combine sewer overflows reported that crassphage by the cpq 064 assay had strong rank correlation with hpyv r 0 72 p 0 01 and enterococci r 0 66 p 0 01 while the cpq 056 assay had moderate correlations with enterococci r 0 42 p 0 05 but weak correlations with hpyv r 0 28 stachler et al 2018 in wastewater crassphage by kp06 gp31 assay was reported to indicate moderate rank correlations with norovirus r 0 54 p 0 01 and hadv r 0 55 p 0 01 balleste et al 2021 theoretically crassphage does not necessarily have constant correlation with the pathogen of human fecal origin because a concentration of the pathogen in wastewater depends on not only the level of fecal contamination but also the infected population in the wastewater source in the previous studies crassphage was often detected with good correlations with pathogenic viruses and bacteria in water moreover the observed correlations were likely to depends on the selected crassphage marker in qpcr assay as well as locality further studies are expected to investigate which crassphage marker have a good correlation with each water related pathogens in various locations antimicrobial resistance in environmental waters is also caused by human fecal pollution agramont et al 2020 chen et al 2021 stachler et al 2019 correlation between crassphage and antibiotic resistance genes args has been also reported in sewage impacted urban waterway the qpcr data showed very strong correlation of sul1 sul2 teto tetw mcr1 and emrf with crassphage li et al 2021b makkaew et al 2021 nguyen et al 2021 stachler et al 2019 recently a significant correlation of crassphage and args was reported by metagenomic data sets analysis of publicly available metagenomic data revealed that the abundance of args in environmental waters was highly correlated with presence of crassphage sequence chen et al 2021 karkman et al 2019 recently the concentration of crassphage was also reportedly useful to normalize viral titers of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 in wastewater for wastewater based epidemiology wbe purposes holm et al 2022 green et al 2020 greenwald et al 2021 heijnen et al 2021 medema et al 2020 polo et al 2021 wilder et al 2021 by normalizing with crassphage the virus titer could reflect better the proportion of infected people to total population in the sewershed heijnen et al 2021 wilder et al 2021 overall crassphage has great potential as human fecal indicator to track point and non point sources of human fecal contamination it also has high correlation with both human gut bacteria and viruses significantly the reported shedding of crassphage in feces is often higher than those of other fib and viruses hence higher detection sensitivity is expected in environmental waters even with low level of contamination crassphage has great advantage over other fibs in terms of sensitivity and specificity to human fecal sources as well as persistence in environmental waters however these advantages could be also affected by locality probably due to geographical diversity of crassphage genotypes although crassphage sequence has been found ubiquitously in wastewater metagenome there is strong evidence of geographical dependence and sequence diversity in sewage edwards et al 2019 stachler and bibby 2014 these diversities are probably associated with diversity of human gut microbiomes which varies geographically and temporally david et al 2014 yatsunenko et al 2012 these geographical diversities of crassphage in wastewater and environmental waters have not been fully understood although it could affect the suitability of crassphage markers in the target region to date studies of crassphage in water has been conducted in a limited number of countries investigations from more countries are expected to understand global diversity of crassphage and local applicability of the crassphage markers for the mst purpose association of crassphage with other human enteric viruses should be explored further to enhance application of crassphage as the fecal indicator i e for normalization in wbe wbe is reported to be effective to probe outbreak situation of norovirus poliovirus influenza virus as well as sars cov 2 heijnen and medema 2011 kazama et al 2016 mueller et al 2009 7 crassphage as a performance indicator for viral reduction in wastewater treatment crassphage also has good potential as a performance indicator virus to assess and ensure virus reduction in wastewater treatment processes at wwtps fib i e e coli are often used to monitor reduction of microbes in wastewater however reduction of viruses in wastewater treatment cannot be assessed accurately by fib because reduction mechanism of virus in wastewater treatment is fundamentally different from that of bacteria dias et al 2018 mcminn et al 2017 the requirements for an indicator virus of reduction performance are that i the virus is consistently present at a high concentration in influent wastewater and ii the virus is more persistent in wastewater treatment than the pathogenic viruses of reduction target consistent presence in wastewater is necessary to enable performance assessment at any time independent of the disease outbreak situation in the sewershed in addition in order to evaluate the treatment performance as lrv the virus is expected to have a high enough concentration in influent wastewater where the virus is still present at a detectable concentration in effluent after treatment consistent presence of crassphage in influent wastewater and treated effluent at wwtps have been reported table 2a crassphage is the most prevalent and quantified virus in influent wastewater as well as pmmov farkas et al 2020 the detection range of crassphage generally exceeds the concentration of rotavirus norovirus enterovirus hepatitis e virus and sapovirus farkas et al 2019 2018a 2018b flannery et al 2013 fumian et al 2013 grøndahl rosado et al 2014 hata et al 2014 kitajima et al 2013 kitajima et al 2014 masclaux et al 2013 prevost et al 2015 qiu et al 2015 simmons et al 2011 among 320 untreated wastewater samples crassphage showed the highest positive ratio of 98 314 320 while pmmov hadv and hpyv were detected 95 158 166 93 111 119 and 80 276 345 respectively ahmed et al 2019a 2018a 2018b crank et al 2020 farkas et al 2019 hamza et al 2019 han et al 2014 hewitt et al 2013 kitajima et al 2014 kongprajug et al 2019 levican et al 2019 malla et al 2019a sangkaew et al 2021 schmitz et al 2016 stachler et al 2017 tandukar et al 2020a b wu et al 2020 moreover crassphage in wastewater is constantly detected independent of seasonal variation a year long studies revealed that crassphage was detected constantly higher concentration than the enteric viruses of hadv hpyv and sapovirus in both influent wastewater and treatment effluent ahmed et al 2021a crank et al 2020 farkas et al 2019 wu et al 2020 meanwhile pathogenic viral fecal indicator hadv and hpyv could be more variable depending on population rate of infection in the sewershed ahmed et al 2021a 2019a elmahdy et al 2020 hamza et al 2019 no significant differences were detected in crassphage abundance based on population coverage nor treatment capacity of wwtps crank et al 2020 furthermore crassphage reportedly had less hourly fluctuations than hadv and pmmov in influent wastewater of a wwtp ahmed et al 2021a consequently crassphage has good potential as performance indicator in terms of consistent presence at detectable concentration both in influent wastewater and treatment effluent with low variation on seasonal daily nor hourly factors persistence in wastewater treatment is another requirement for the indicator virus to ensure reduction of the pathogenic viruses of reduction target in wastewater treatment processes if the indicator virus is more persistent than the pathogenic viruses the pathogenic virus are also expected to have greater lrv than the indicator virus thus by maintaining lrv of the indicator virus at the target level we can ensure that lrv of the pathogenic viruses would be better or at least at equal level to the indicator virus the lrv of crassphage in conventional activated sludge process is reported as 1 2 2 9 log10 table 2a farkas et al 2019 kongprajug et al 2019 sangkaew et al 2021 wu et al 2020 while hadv and hpyv have 0 8 3 7 log10 and 1 0 3 7 log10 of lrv respectively hamza et al 2011 hata et al 2013 kitajima et al 2014 sangkaew et al 2021 schmitz et al 2016 sidhu et al 2017 tandukar et al 2020a wu et al 2020 lrv of aichi virus 1 is reported in range of 0 79 2 7 log10 while 1 2 3 7 log10 reduction for norovirus kitajima et al 2013 2014 malla et al 2019a schmitz et al 2016 haramoto et al 2006 since log reduction of crassphage is less variable than other viruses crassphage has good potential as performance indicator for reduction of pathogenic viruses furthermore since crassphage is a dna virus it is potentially persistent than other human enteric viruses which are mostly rna viruses it could be suitable for the long term monitoring of pathogenic viruses in wastewater environmental waters and source tracking for sewage contamination implementation of crassphage as fecal indicator could improve the wbe risk assessment and global human health 8 perspectives fib have long history of application for monitoring and control of waterborne pathogenic bacteria in aquatic environment and wastewater treatment since pcr invention in 1980s the extensive number of research on waterborne viruses have been conducted to understand fate of viruses in water environment and wastewater treatment accompanying with better understanding on fate of pathogenic viruses in water importance of indicator viruses has been emphasized which can be applied for monitoring and control of the pathogenic viruses in environmental waters and wastewater treatment recently both crassphage and pmmov have been expected as the promising candidates of fecal indicator virus according to our extensive review of literature crassphage is globally distributed and have high abundance than other fecal and pathogenic viruses thus crassphage has universally good potential as an indicator virus of human fecal origin in environmental waters its high sensitivity and specificity to human feces also suggest its good potential for application as the mst marker to track the source of human fecal pollution in environmental waters moreover its correlation with pathogenic viruses highlights potential applicability of crassphage as water quality indicator for public health however a molecular based indicator is not directly applicable to quantitative microbial risk assessment but needs careful consideration haas 2020 to this end relations of crassphage with infectious pathogenic viruses needs to be investigated further recently several assays have been developed to quantify potentially infectious viruses with capsid integrity and applied to evaluate intact viruses in water treatment leifels et al 2021 sano et al 2015 cuevas ferrando et al 2022 cuevas ferrando et al 2022 reported that crassphage correlated with some intact capsid viruses of norovirus gi and gii human astrovirus hastv and rotavirus in influent wastewater and norovirus gi and hastv in treated wastewater application of these techniques to the studies in various water bodies could reveal feasibility and limitations of crassphage as a water quality indicator furthermore most of the studies on crassphage in water were conducted in temperate climate regions more studies in tropical and subarctic regions are expected for further understanding of geographical distribution and universal feasibility of crassphage as an indicator virus especially cross reactivity of crassphage marker with animal feces had geographic variations to ensure the specificity of crassphage as human fecal marker assay optimization e g combination with other markers and prior confirmation with reference samples in the target area would be effective understanding of geographical diversity of crassphage genotypes would be helpful for selection of the crassphage assay appropriate to the target area our review on wastewater treatment studies revealed that crassphage is also potentially available as a performance indicator of virus reduction in wastewater treatment processes crassphage is highly abundant in influent wastewater of wwtps independent of seasonal fluctuations and disease outbreak situations in the sewershed importantly crassphage is more persistent in wastewater treatment than most pathogenic viruses therefore maintaining lrv of crassphage can ensure reduction performance of the pathogenic viruses which are mostly more vulnerable in wastewater treatment application of crassphage as the performance indicator would be useful to secure safety in water reclamation especially when the reclaimed water is used for the direct drinking purpose however studies of crassphage on its reduction in water reclamation is quite limited to date water reclamation is often composed of membrane filtration and disinfection processes further investigation is needed on lrvs of crassphage and their relations with those of pathogenic viruses in various settings of membrane i e uf nanofiltration reverse osmosis membrane fouling stage etc and disinfection i e chlorination ozonation and ultraviolet processes since discovery of crassphage in 2014 scientific knowledge on crassphage in wastewater is still being developed by filling research gaps addressed in this review crasspahge would be more powerful and useful tool for water quality management to secure public health 9 conclusions crassphage is globally distributed in wastewaters and various fecal contaminated water bodies at high concentrations without seasonal fluctuations crassphage is highly specific to human fecal contamination and is rarely found in animal feces it also has a good potential as a performance indicator to ensure virus reduction in wastewater treatment systems accordingly crassphage could be an effective tool for monitoring of human fecal contamination and potential presence of fecal pathogenic microbes in environmental waters although remarkable progress in recent studies on crassphage in wastewaters and environmental waters further research is expected to fill the following research gaps i relations of crassphage with infectious pathogenic viruses especially to clarify the effectiveness of crassphage in quantitative microbial risk assessment ii geographical distribution of crassphage in tropical and subarctic regions to vefiry universal feasibility of crassphage as an indicator virus and iii fate and reduction of crassphage in water reclamation processes particularly on relations of reduction between crassphage and other pathogenic viruses bridging these research gaps would make crassphage a powerful tool to support the control of water related health risks credit authorship contribution statement

15710,viral indicators of human fecal contamination in wastewaters and environmental waters have been getting much attention in the past decade cross assembly phage crassphage is the most abundant dna virus in human feces recently the usefulness of crassphage as a microbial source tracking and water quality monitoring tool for human fecal contamination has been highlighted here we conducted a comprehensive review on crassphage in water focusing on detection methodology concentration range in various waters and wastewaters specificity to human fecal contamination and reduction in wastewater treatment systems this review highlights that crassphage is globally distributed in wastewaters and various fecal contaminated water bodies at high concentrations without seasonal fluctuations crassphage is highly specific to human fecal contamination and is rarely found in animal feces it also has a good potential as a performance indicator to ensure virus reduction in wastewater treatment systems accordingly crassphage could be an effective tool for monitoring of human fecal contamination and potential presence of fecal pathogenic microbes in environmental waters bridging the research

et al 2018 waterborne gastroenteritis has been estimated to cause 3 4 million deaths per year worldwide who 2014 sewage contaminated water is predicted to be the major cause of these infections who 2014 ramani and kang 2009 viruses can enter aquatic environments not only through poorly treated or untreated wastewater bibby et al 2019 okoh et al 2010 but also from the effluent of wastewater treatment systems carducci et al 2009 schmitz et al 2016 the widely used fecal indicator bacteria fib do not mimic the dynamics of viral pathogens such as transportation and decay in water environment and wastewater treatment kitajima et al 2014 qiu et al 2015 sidhu et al 2018 therefore direct monitoring of viruses is necessary to control of such pathogenic viruses in recreational and drinking water systems cross assembly phage crassphage has recently been discovered via viral metagenomic analysis which has enabled the discovery of unculturable viruses stachler and bibby 2014 found that crassphage is highly abundant in sewage and is not detected in most animal feces thus they concluded that crassphage can be applied as a microbial source tracking mst marker to track sewage pollution in environmental water bodies recent studies have also reported the high abundance of crassphage and stronger correlations of crassphage with enteric viruses than other fecal markers ballesté et al 2019 farkas et al 2019 malla et al 2019b stachler et al 2018 wu et al 2020 the newly discovered crassphage has great potentials for a broad range of applications in fecal virus monitoring as well as mst in environmental waters and wastewater treatment which may circumvent the shortcomings in the existing methodologies of virus monitoring and control this review summarizes the up to date knowledge on crassphage in water engineering and the potential application of crassphage as a human fecal virus indicator and mst marker this review highlights the quantification methodology abundance in various waters reduction in wastewater treatment systems sensitivity and specificity to human fecal contamination and comparison with other currently available viral indicators this review aims to help researchers and water engineers who work on fecal virus pollution in water environments and to facilitate the application of crassphage in the field of water environment studies 2 basics of crassphage crassphage is a recently discovered bacteriophage from human gut metagenomic data dutilh et al 2014 crassphage was named after metagenomic sequence data processing cross assembly the technique whereby this bacteriophage was discovered dutilh et al 2014 it belongs to the family of crass like phages which infect bacteroides species gut commensal bacteria to date the crass like phages have four subfamilies and 10 candidate genera guerin et al 2018 several crass like phages have been isolated from human feces and found to infect bacteroides for example φcrass001 was found to infect bacteroides intestinalis shkoporov et al 2018 φcrass002 infects bacteroides xylanisolvens guerin et al 2021 dac15 and dac17 infect bacteroides thetaiotaomicron hryckowian et al 2020 furthermore crass like phages are also found in termite guts cat non human primates groundwaters and oceanic environments li et al 2021a cinek et al 2018 holmfeldt et al 2013 yutin et al 2018 among the crass like bacteriophages crassphage has recently been proposed as a biomarker for human fecal contamination since it is entirely associated with the human gut microbiome ahmed et al 2018a edwards et al 2019 farkas et al 2019 yutin et al 2018 the crassphage genome consists of 97 kbp double stranded dna dsdna and is prevalent in available us gut metagenomic data dutilh et al 2014 honap et al 2020 crassphage is the most abundant human associated virus found in approximately 50 of human gut viromes koonin and yutin 2020 additionally crassphage is 6 times more abundant than any other known bacteriophage and thus could be reconstructed from the available metagenomes dutilh et al 2014 the latest study indicates that crassphage can be present in the guts of one month old infants tamburini et al 2018 in line with the fact that bacteroides are the most abundant in the gut microbiome of newborns bäckhed et al 2015 additionally it has been suggested that a single crassphage strain present in the gut of most adults tamburini et al 2018 although some adults can have even hundreds of multiple strains edwards et al 2019 the prevalence of crassphage in different environmental reservoirs has recently been explored ahmed et al 2021a kongprajug et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 crassphage is abundantly present in environments with human fecal pollution garcía aljaro et al 2017 and can be easily detected via polymerase chain reaction pcr based assays however further investigation is necessary to explore genotype distribution of crassphage and environmental dynamics of these genotypes honap et al 2020 koonin and yutin 2020 shkoporov et al 2018 sommers et al 2021 in addition crassphage relation to pathogenic viruses can help to define the fate in environment 3 measurement of crassphage in wastewater and environmental waters to detect and quantify the crassphage in water quantitative pcr qpcr is generally used a taqman based qpcr assay for crassphage has been developed stachler et al 2017 among the 384 primer sets designed from a meta consensus genome stachler et al reported two novel qpcr assays for crassphage cpq 056 and cpq 064 which could quantitatively evaluate the viral discharge from sewage into water bodies to date several types of pcr primer and probe sets have been developed for crassphage table 1 another taqman based qpcr assay kp06 gp31 gene has been developed and applied to detect crassphage in wastewater garcía aljaro et al 2017 among the taqman qpcr assays developed so far cpq 056 and cpq 064 have been widely used for quantification of crassphage in stool surface water wastewater storm drain outfall river water treated drinking water and sediments ahmed et al 2021a 2019a 2018a 2018b farkas et al 2019 jennings et al 2020 kongprajug et al 2019 sangkaew et al 2021 stachler et al 2018 2017 tandukar et al 2020a 2020b wu et al 2020 the detection efficiency in wastewater has been reported to be 100 for either cpq 056 or cpq 064 assay when 1 10 2 ng of total dna is used as the template dna while the efficiency was reported 45 and 53 for cpq 056 and cpq 064 respectively when 1 10 3 ng dna is used stachler et al 2017 another crassphage assay of kp06 gp31 also reportedly showed 100 of detection efficiency among 23 samples of municipal wastewater garcía aljaro et al 2017 limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq depend on the efficiency in sample processing i e virus concentration and nucleotide extraction and in qpcr detection ahmed et al 2018a 2018b defined the assay lod alod in qpcr as the lowest number of the target gene copies detected in 2 3 of qpcr replicates the same authors estimated the alods of cpq 056 and cpq 064 to be three gene copies gc reaction ahmed et al 2018a 2018b 2021b the limits of detection and quantification can be affected by any pcr inhibitor that may be present in the water sample dilution of the template sometimes enhances sensitivity in such cases ahmed et al 2018b primary concentration of viruses is often recommended to enhance detection sensitivity in qpcr assays concentration methods that are typically used for other enteric viruses in environmental waters are applicable to crassphage there are very few studies that have checked the recovery rate of crassphage and it still needs to be explored no method is fully optimized for crassphage concentration however popularly used methods for primary concentration of crassphage in water are i microfiltration mf ii electrostatic adsorption often known as electronegative membrane or electropositive membrane enm epm method iii ultrafiltration uf iv ultracentrifuge and v polyethylene glycol peg precipitation the most popular method to concentrate the crassphage in these types of water samples is the enm method ahmed et al 2018b 2019b jennings et al 2020 kongprajug et al 2019 malla et al 2019a 2019b sala comorera et al 2021 sangkaew et al 2021 tandukar et al 2020a stachler et al 2018 2019 wu et al 2020 to enhance detection sensitivity the enm epm methods are often followed by a secondary concentration via uf malla et al 2019b morrison et al 2020 stachler et al 2017 ward et al 2020 or peg precipitation farkas et al 2019 mf methods have been also used for primary concentration of the crassphage in various water samples including untreated and treated wastewater surface water and seawater ballesté et al 2019 sangkaew et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 in the mf method viral particles adhering on suspended solids are captured on a membrane filter with 0 2 µm or 0 45 µm pore size free viral particles in the liquid fraction are not collected since the pore size of the membrane is larger than viral particles the electrostatic adsorption method which is often known as the enm epm method is popularly utilized to concentrate crassphage ahmed et al 2018b jennings et al 2020 malla et al 2019a 2019b ward et al 2020 sangkaew et al 2021 stachler et al 2018 wu et al 2020 tandukar et al 2020a 2020b most enteric viruses have protein capsids which have positive electrostatic charge under the acidic condition or negative charge under the neutral to base condition first viruses in a water sample are adsorbed by electrostatic coupling to a charged membrane in the enm method a sample is pre acidified to make viral particles positively charged or the membrane was preconditioned with divalent mg2 solution ikner et al 2012 michen and graule 2010 the adsorbed viruses are often eluted and collected by decoupling the electrostatic bond with a basic buffer in the enm method or with an acidic buffer in the epm method where viral protein capsid is turned to have charges repulsive to the membrane otherwise the membrane filter adsorbing viruses is sometimes directly subject to dna extraction the sample volume for detection of enteric viruses by mf and enm epm methods depends on the sample type and the objective of the study the advantage of the enm epm methods is applicability to a large sample volume e g up to 5 l for a sample with low turbidity the drawback is the necessity of turbidity removal for a highly turbid sample prior to application to prevent clogging of the membrane filter the sample size is often chosen as the maximum volume to avoid clogging the membrane or multiple membranes can be utilized if the sample is very turbid the typical volume of the virus concentrate in the enm epm methods is 5 15 ml the viral nucleotide can be also extracted directly from the membrane without elution by using bead beating extraction jennings et al 2020 in addition secondary concentration by using uf is sometimes applied after the enm epm method if the crassphage concentration is expected to be low or other enteric viruses are also targeted in the uf viruses are concentrated by size exclusion with uf membrane filter which typically has a 10 100 kda molecular weight cut off mwco cashdollar and wymer 2013 hill et al 2005 ultrafiltration centrifugal units are also often used for virus concentration ahmed et al 2020a ikner et al 2011 malla et al 2019a symonds et al 2009 tandukar et al 2020a amicon ultra 15 centrifugal unit can rapidly process 15 ml whereas centricon plus 70 can process 70 ml at a time with a 3 100 kda mwco membrane filter the typical volume of the concentrate after ultrafiltration is 200 700 µl which is ready for dna extraction uf for secondary concentration can recover 17 83 of enteric viruses ikner et al 2011 the drawbacks of these centrifugal units are relatively high cost concentration of viruses only from liquid fractions and simultaneous concentration of pcr inhibitors ultracentrifugation concentrates viral particles in a water sample through high speed centrifugation at 100 000 g for 1 4 h fumian et al 2010b ikner et al 2012 however the high initial cost of an ultracentrifuge machine and small processing volumes 10 ml 1 l may discourage the usage of this concentration method for water samples the peg precipitation method concentrates eluted viruses via precipitation at a high ionic concentration and neutral ph the advantage of this method is minimal contamination with other organic materials that may inhibit pcr lewis and metcalf 1988 the peg reagents with a molecular weight of 6 kda 20 kda are popularly used for this method generally samples of 40 ml 1 l from water matrices can be subjected to concentration ahmed et al 2020a gyawali et al 2019 hata et al 2021 hewitt et al 2011 mull and hill 2012 torii et al 2022 viruses in a water sample are concentrated by adding 8 16 w v of peg and 2 4 w v of nacl then incubating at 4 c for 2 h to overnight the virus concentrate is collected by centrifuge the advantage of the peg precipitation method is the reasonable cost and processing without any special skills or equipment needed but its drawback is its inapplicability to large volume samples along with any of these concentration steps process control is required to identify the efficiency and any failure in sample processing and detection haramoto et al 2018 detection efficiency of process control incorporates loss of viral dna in sample processing steps and low pcr efficiency due to inhibitors in wastewaters and environmental waters sufficient sample volume is important to detect and quantify the crassphage in environmental waters the appropriate sample volume depends on the expected concentration of crassphage which is speculated by the type of water such as untreated wastewater treated wastewater surface water etc described in detail in the next section and the extent of human fecal pollution the required sample volume restricts the selection of primary concentration methods the typical sample volume of untreated wastewater required for quantification of crassphage is 100 µl 200 ml to quantitate the crassphage in untreated wastewater the mf and enm epm methods are often applied for virus concentration ballesté et al 2019 jennings et al 2020 malla et al 2019a sala comorera et al 2021 tandukar et al 2020a direct dna extraction with no concentration step is also sometimes applicable ahmed et al 2021a 2021b 2019b for secondary treated wastewater or effluent of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp 500 ml 2 l sample volume is required farkas et al 2019 kongprajug et al 2019 morrison et al 2020 sangkaew et al 2021 wu et al 2020 the sample volume of surface waters with human fecal pollution should be 50 ml 2 l depending on the extent of the pollution ahmed et al 2018a farkas et al 2019 jennings et al 2020 malla et al 2019b sangkaew et al 2021 stachler et al 2017 ward et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 when a slight impact of human feces is expected in the water e g spring water and storm water a 500 ml 2 l sample volume is needed ahmed et al 2018a 2018b sangkaew et al 2021 stachler et al 2018 for sediments impacted by fecal pollution a 5 10 g sample has been reported to be enough for direct detection of crassphage with no concentration step ahmed et al 2020b or virus elution followed by peg precipitation farkas et al 2019 polo et al 2021 crassphage could be detected from 1 l of groundwater sample processed with the enm method malla et al 2019b and 10 l of seawater sample processed by the mf method sangkaew et al 2021 the selection of the concentration method is the key to enhancing detection efficiency and sensitivity the appropriate method should be chosen by considering the water type expected level of human fecal contamination available sample volume as well as available laboratory resources 4 presence of crassphage in wastewater and aquatic environments the prevalence of crassphage in various aquatic environments including untreated and treated wastewaters stormwater rivers sediments and wastewater contaminated streams has been investigated ahmed et al 2018a 2018b farkas et al 2019 garcía aljaro et al 2017 stachler et al 2018 crassphage is present constantly in municipal wastewater in untreated wastewater crassphage concentration is 4 8 12 0 log10 gc l in most countries table 2 a the reported maximum concentration in untreated wastewater is 11 0 12 0 log10 gc l in japan malla et al 2019a the crassphage concentration in untreated wastewater is 7 4 10 0 log10 gc l in the high income countries hic of the usa the uk australia new zealand and spain but in the range of 4 8 8 2 log10 gc l in other asian countries of thailand and china ahmed et al 2018a 2019b 2018b 2021b cuevas ferrando et al 2022 farkas et al 2019 garcía aljaro et al 2017 gyawali et al 2021 kongprajug et al 2019 papp et al 2020 sangkaew et al 2021 tandukar et al 2020a b wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 although the reported range of crassphage concentration varies by region the constant presence of crassphage in influent wastewater is reported worldwide detection efficiency in influent has been reported in 100 of 32 samples in the usa ahmed et al 2018a tandukar et al 2020a wu et al 2020 of 26 samples in australia ahmed et al 2021a 2019a 2019b 2018b 2021b of 23 samples in spain garcía aljaro et al 2017 of 49 samples in the uk farkas et al 2019 and of 68 samples in thailand kongprajug et al 2019 sangkaew et al 2021 in italy 96 of 156 influent samples tested positive crank et al 2020 accordingly crassphage is highly likely to be present at high concentrations in most influent wastewater in any country the variation in crassphage concentration among different regions may be due to differences in urbanization level climate conditions and the impact of diet on the gut microbiome honap et al 2020 kau et al 2011 stachler and bibby 2014 in treated wastewater crassphage has been detected in the concentration range of 4 8 8 6 log10 gc l table 2 a the mean concentration of crassphage detected in treated effluent was 6 5 log10 gc l in hic ballesté et al 2019 farkas et al 2019 gyawali et al 2021 morrison et al 2020 tandukar sherchan and haramoto 2020a b wu et al 2020 the constant presence of crassphage in treated wastewater has also been reported by year long monitoring studies detection ratios in secondary treated effluent and disinfected final effluent have been reported to be 100 13 13 and 85 11 13 respectively in 1 year monthly monitoring at wwtps tandukar et al 2020a ballesté et al 2019 reported 100 11 11 detection with no seasonal variability upon 2 year monitoring at a wwtp and inter comparison of 18 wwtps the overall log reduction values lrvs of crassphage in wwtps is 1 0 2 9 log10 table 2 a the median lrv from our literature review was 1 6 log10 fig 1 the lrv at wwtp varies dependent on process configuration the lrvs by the conventional activated sludge cas process mostly ranged between 1 8 and 2 5 log10 farkas et al 2019 gyawali et al 2021 kongprajug et al 2019 sangkaew et al 2021 tandukar et al 2020a wu et al 2020 however the highest lrv by cas reported to date was 3 3 1 0 log10 tandukar et al 2020a while the lowest lrv by cas is reported 1 0 2 0 log10 farkas et al 2019 tandukar et al 2020a a membrane bioreactor mbr process reported to have better lrvs of crassphage than cas as generally reported with other viruses crasphage in mbr permeates was below the loq of 120 gc l papp et al 2020 the estimated lrvs by mbr were 6 0 log10 on the other hand biofilter treatment process showed 1 0 log10 reduction without disinfection farkas et al 2019 chlorination after secondary treatment is reported to have no reduction to maximum 0 7 log10 tandukar et al 2020a b wu et al 2020 however it should be noted that pcr assay would detect the remaining viral genes even though the virus is inactivated in the course of wastewater treatment including chlorination therefore reduction of intact viruses could be higher than lrv of the viral gene markers sano et al 2010 there are still a limited number of studies on reduction of crassphage in wastewater treatment reduction of crassphage is likely to depend on treatment process so far its reduction was mostly studied in cas process further investigation on reduction of crassphage in other secondary processes is needed to understand for effect of operational conditions and quantitative relation with reduction of enteric viruses crassphage is reportedly often detected in environmental waters receiving human fecal pollution the detected concentration range of crassphage in rivers is 2 6 9 0 log10 gc l ballesté et al 2019 farkas et al 2019 jennings et al 2020 kongprajug et al 2019 malla et al 2019a 2019b stachler et al 2017 ward et al 2020 table 2 b in highly polluted rivers crassphage is generally found at persistently high concentrations and has no seasonal variation in rivers with low pollution crassphage is found at relatively lower concentrations with a large variation based on the season the upstream sites of rivers surrounded by low density rural housing mostly recorded no detection whereas downstream regions often had the maximum detection of crassphage jennings et al 2020 ward et al 2020 climate conditions are also the impact factor on crassphage concentration in rivers precipitation positively correlated with the concentration of crassphage in rivers due to increased loading from stormwater wwtp effluent diffuse pollution originating from septic tanks and sediments mobilization ballesté et al 2019 stachler et al 2018 temperature reportedly has a strongly negative correlation with crassphage concentration ballesté et al 2019 it is probably because viral dna tends to decrease more rapidly in summer due to higher temperature and higher irradiation crassphage is often detected in water bodies receiving urban stormwater runoff urban drainage affected by the combined sewer overflows csos showed high concentration of crassphage at 5 0 7 0 log10 gc l stachler et al 2018 ahmed et al 2018a reported an increase in detection ratio at stormwater drain under wet weather conditions suggesting that discharge of human fecal pollution in stormwater runoff increase in concentration and detection ratio of crassphage under wet weather conditions has also been reported in stream and lake water receiving csos ahmed et al 2019b 2018b in the lake affected by cso 97 100 of the samples contained up to 7 0 log10 gc l under wet weather whereas only 20 of the samples showed detection at lower concentrations than 3 0 log10 gc l under dry weather ahmed et al 2019b 2018b stachler et al 2018 2019 crassphage has been detected with a range of 4 3 8 3 log10 in the sediments of contaminated rivers gc g ballesté et al 2019 farkas et al 2019 generally the detection efficiency of crassphage was over 90 in water bodies with human fecal pollution suggesting the usefulness of crassphage for detection of viral contamination by municipal wastewater sources in aquatic environment high correlations of crassphage with the other fecal indictors have been reported in municipal wastewater and aquatic environment with human fecal pollution a study in urban stream impacted by combined sewer overflows reported the cpq 064 assay strongly correlated with fecal indicator escherichia coli e coli and enterococci while cpq 056 assay correlated strongly with somatic coliphage stachler et al 2018 another study reported that kp06 gp31 assay had statistically significant correlations both with e coli and somatic coliphages in effluents of 18 wwtps and downstream river water samples balleste et al 2019 in contrast crassphage reportedly had low correlations with e coli in wastewater of animal origin crassphage by kp06 gp31 assay in cow poutry and porcine wastewater was detected at much lower than in human origin wastewater although quite high concentrations of e coli were observed in all types of wastewater garcia aljaro et al 2017 the average log ratio of crassphage to e coli was 1 7 log10 in human origin wastewater while it was 1 5 log10 in wastewater of animal origin these studies demostrated that crassphage could detect human fecal contamination specifically while e coli can detect broader fecal contamination of both human and animal origin persistence in environmental waters is also an advantage of using crassphage as a contamination indicator although its decay depends on temperature ballesté et al 2019 first order decay rate constants k are reported 0 1365 d 1 9 1 d for 90 reduction at 25 c k 0 05 d 1 27 5 d for 90 reduction at 15 c ahmed et al 2021b ballesté et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 decay of crassphage in environment is also affected by ultraviolet intensity from sunlight crassphage in lake waters is reportedly more persistent near the bottom than near the surface ahmed et al 2018b furthermore crassphage showed slower inactivation than bacterial fecal indicators greaves et al 2020 and quantifiable for longer period of time than human pelyomavirus hpyv and human adenovirus hadv ahmed et al 2019c this demonstrates that crassphage can represent viral fate effectively of the sewage contaminated water as compared to fib overall crassphage has been widely detected in wastewater and water bodies affected by human fecal contamination however few studies have been conducted so far in groundwater environments crassphage could be useful to track distribution of human enteric viruses through groundwater flows these types of studies will be helpful in evaluating the use of crassphage as an indicator tool 5 application as a human fecal indicator and microbial source tracking marker crassphage is a promising human fecal indicator and mst marker of human fecal contamination this bacteriophage has the following advantages as a human fecal indicator over other phage indicators i the concentration of the human gut associated crassphage in sewage is higher than that of other phage or enteric viruses bivins et al 2020 edwards et al 2019 ii crassphage has a close relation to other human viral pathogens in wastewater treatment systems such as hpyv and hadv crank et al 2020 wu et al 2020 and iii crassphage has strong durability to environmental stress than fib wu et al 2020 these characteristics satisfy the bonde s criteria for an ideal indicator of waterborne pathogens which includes to i be present whenever the pathogens are present ii occur in much greater numbers than pathogens and iii be more resistant to disinfectants and to the aqueous environment than the pathogens nasem 2004 therefore crassphage is potentially a good human fecal indicator with high sensitivity which is broadly detectable and reflects human fecal pollution in environmental waters the high abundance of crassphage in sewage has been reported in various countries in europe usa africa and asia edwards et al 2019 stachler and bibby 2014 hence application of crassphage as a mst marker for human fecal source has been investigated worldwide including the usa ahmed et al 2018a stachler et al 2018 chile jennings et al 2020 the uk farkas et al 2019 italy crank et al 2020 spain garcía aljaro et al 2017 australia ahmed et al 2018b japan malla et al 2019a thailand kongprajug et al 2019 and nepal malla et al 2019b the superior performance and suitability of crassphage versus other human specific viral markers for human fecal source tracking have recently been reported based on metagenomic data sets chen et al 2021 an important advantage of crassphage as a fecal indicator is high specificity to human fecal contamination it could be detected in some of animal feces however its concentrations are often lower in non human sources than in human and sewage sources most of studies reported detection of crassphage is highly related to human feces with limited cross reactivity to other animal feces e g poultry swine and cats ahmed et al 2018a 2018b jennings et al 2020 kongprajug et al 2019 host specificity and sensitivity are the key factors for a suitable mst marker ahmed et al 2018b host specificity is the proportion of negative results produced by non target host fecal samples whereas sensitivity is the proportion of positives in the targeted host samples among the various crassphage markers developed so far table 1 cpq 056 and cpq 064 are popularly used in mst studies these crassphage markers reportedly have high sensitivity and specificity to the human fecal contamination in environmental waters cpq 056 and cpq 064 primer sets have shown 100 of sensitivity and detection in sewage samples in many studies ahmed et al 2019a 2018a 2018b kongprajug et al 2020 sangkaew et al 2021 stachler et al 2017 the overall sensitivity and specificity of crassphage based on cpq 056 and cpq 064 in comparison with those of other mst markers are shown in fig 2 the mean sensitivity and specificity of crassphage to human feces were 92 and 93 respectively in the reported studies fig 2 ahmed et al 2019a 2018b kongprajug et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 although the sensitivity of pepper mild mottle virus pmmov marker is also reportedly 100 its specificity has a larger variability than that of crassphage markers fig 2 hadv and hpyv markers exhibited 100 of host specificity although they have been reported to have larger variations of sensitivity and lower detected concentrations 2 1 5 7 log10 gc l depending on the illness rates in the community elmahdy et al 2020 among 23 tested animal feces 17 showed no cross reactivity with cpq 056 and cpq 064 markers while cross reactivity was observed with cat dog duck gull pig and rabbit feces fig 3 although cross reactivity was found in some animals crassphage was not always detected in the feces of these animal feces the positive ratios of cpq 056 were 22 4 in cats 13 58 10 2 in dogs 12 118 28 0 in ducks 14 50 11 4 in gulls 4 35 20 0 in rabbits 8 40 and 9 20 in pigs 22 239 while cpq 064 was detected in 32 3 of cats 10 31 1 20 of dogs 1 83 20 6 of pigs 20 97 37 1 of ducks 13 35 and 24 2 of rabbits 8 33 moreover crassphage shedding in animal feces is 2 4 log10 lower than shedding in human feces fig 3 shedding of crassphage in human feces has been reported to be 4 2 8 9 log10 gc g ahmed et al 2019a 2018b zhang et al 2020 among companion animals dogs and rabbits shed 2 7 3 3 log10 gc g feces whereas cats have highly variable shedding of 4 8 8 6 log10 gc g ahmed et al 2019a 2018b gyawali et al 2021 stachler et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 feedstock animals such as cows pigs gulls and ducks shed 2 9 4 1 log10 gc g ahmed et al 2018b gyawali et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 although the positive ratio among individual animal feces is low it might be detected more frequently in wastewater which is discharged from a large population of animals so far there are the limited number of studies which investigated crassphage in animal wastewater malla et al 2019 ahmed et al 2018b garcia aljaro et al 2017 while the positive ratio of crassphage was 100 in municipal wastewater in all the studies most of animal wastewater had lower positive ratios the positive ratio in cattle wastewater was reportedly 17 2 12 with both of cpq 056 and cpq 064 ahmed et al 2018b in pig wastewater 100 3 3 with cpq 056 malla et al 2019 and 0 0 12 with cpq 056 and cpq 064 ahmed et al 2018b garcia aljaro et al 2017 reported the positive ratio of kp06 gp31 was 61 25 41 of total 41 livestock wastewater samples which was composed of 12 cattle wastewater samples from 4 slaughter houses 15 pig wastewater samples from 4 abattoirs and 14 poultry wastewater samples from 2 slaughter houses more importantly the crassphage concentrations detected in animal wastewater were much lower than in human wastewater the detected concentrations of cpq 056 and cpq 064 in cattle and pig wastewater were approximately 2 to 4 log10 lower than in municipal wastewater malla et al 2019 ahmed et al 2018b whereas the average detected concentrations of kp06 gp31 in livestock wastewater was lower by 2 log10 than municipal wastewater garcia aljaro et al 2017 although crassphage can be detected in some animal wastewater it is mostly present at a much lower concentration than in wastewater of human fecal origin the cross reactivity in animals varies by locality too cross reactivity with cat feces has been reported in some studies in us australia and new zealand but not in china li et al 2021a zhang et al 2020 ahmed et al 2019a 2018b gyawali et al 2021 in chile no cross reactivity has been observed with dogs whereas cross reactivity with ducks has been observed only in china jennings et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 in thailand cross reactivity has been detected only in a swine composite fecal sample 1 39 composite samples not in cattle chicken duck goat and sheep kongprajug et al 2019 sangkaew et al 2021 another crassphage marker kp06 gp31 reportedly indicated 41 of cross reactivity among 41 slurry wastewater samples of cow pigs and poultry however the detected concentrations were lower by 1 5 3 5 log10 than municipal wastewater garcía aljaro et al 2017 moreover this marker has not been detected in dog or gull feces sala comorera et al 2021 the specificity of the kp06 gp31 marker possibly has geographic dependence a recent comprehensive study has reported that this marker indicated 100 of specificity in germany austria and finland ballesté et al 2021 although the specificity was low in portugal 38 and spain 10 the detected concentrations in livestock wastewater were at least 1 log10 lower than in municipal wastewater the high host specificity and sensitivity of crassphage markers suggest that these markers are suitable as the human fecal indicators in environmental waters although their sensitivity and specificity reportedly depend on locality it is recommended to confirm their sensitivity and specificity with reference samples to choose the appropriate marker in the target area among the crassphage markers cpq 056 and cpq 064 are highly specific and sensitive human fecal indicators cats show the highest cross reactivity and the largest fecal shedding among animals however the positive ratios in cat feces are still lower than those in human feces although the detected range of shedding is similar to that in humans since the human population in most communities is much larger than the cat population detection of crassphage in environmental waters is often likely to indicate the presence of human fecal sources the high cross reactivity with cats might be due to the presence of homolog genes or related sequences in microorganisms in animals ahmed et al 2019a shanks et al 2008 stachler et al 2018 assay optimization such as combination of two crassphage markers would be effective to enhance specificity to human fecal sources in comparison to crassphage pmmov is another promising human fecal indicator and mst marker the typical concentration of pmmov reported in untreated wastewater ranges from 6 to 10 log10 gc l gyawali et al 2019 hamza et al 2011 kitajima et al 2014 kuroda et al 2015 rosario et al 2009 schmitz et al 2016 the abundance of pmmov is high in wastewater and feces where pepper products are consumed symonds et al 2018 however one of the limitations of pmmov compared to crassphage is that pmmov cannot be used as a fecal indicator near pepper cultivation areas because bell and chili peppers are the primary source of this virus although pmmov has shown high sensitivity to human feces by qpcr assay its specificity is limited to 48 2 90 0 which is lower than crassphage gyawali et al 2019 hamza et al 2011 malla et al 2019b rosario et al 2009 symonds et al 2018 cross reaction of pmmov is reported with feces of more animals than crassphage such as black swan cow chicken dog duck geese seagull and pig malla et al 2019b rosario et al 2009 symonds et al 2018 hpyv and hadv have also been proposed as indicators for human sewage contamination due to their host specificity albinana gimenez et al 2009 bofill mas et al 2006 2000 hewitt et al 2013 pina et al 1998 among the members of hpyvs the abundance of jc polyomavirus jcpyv is much more than that of bk polyomavirus bkpyv or merkel cell polyomavirus mcpyv in wastewater and lies in ranges of 3 to 8 log10 gc l bofill mas et al 2006 farkas et al 2018b fumian et al 2010a kitajima et al 2014 levican et al 2019 rusiñol et al 2015 schmitz et al 2016 typical concentration ranges of hadv are reported as 1 to 10 log10 gc l assis et al 2017 bofill mas et al 2006 carducci and verani 2013 elmahdy et al 2019 farkas et al 2018a hamza et al 2009 la rosa et al 2010 sidhu et al 2017 simmons et al 2011 both are highly specific to humans and prevalent in various environmental water matrices the drawback of hpyv and hadv is that their concentration depends on infected population in a community detection sensitivity of hpyv and hadv varies depending on not only fecal contamination but also infected population hence crassphage is more suitable to quantify fecal contamination level than hpyv and hadv because crassphage is abundant in most of population and directly reflects their fecal discharge presence of crassphage in environmental waters is often associated with other microbes of health concern e g pathogenic viruses and antimicrobial resistance correlations of crassphage with norovirus hpyv e coli and enterococci have been reported in environmental waters with human fecal pollution jennings et al 2020 stachler et al 2018 in an urban river affected by wwtp effluents crassphage by cpq 064 assay indicated strong correlations with norovirus gii particularly when norovirus were detected while it had low correlation with enterococci jennings et al 2020 another study in urban stream affected by combine sewer overflows reported that crassphage by the cpq 064 assay had strong rank correlation with hpyv r 0 72 p 0 01 and enterococci r 0 66 p 0 01 while the cpq 056 assay had moderate correlations with enterococci r 0 42 p 0 05 but weak correlations with hpyv r 0 28 stachler et al 2018 in wastewater crassphage by kp06 gp31 assay was reported to indicate moderate rank correlations with norovirus r 0 54 p 0 01 and hadv r 0 55 p 0 01 balleste et al 2021 theoretically crassphage does not necessarily have constant correlation with the pathogen of human fecal origin because a concentration of the pathogen in wastewater depends on not only the level of fecal contamination but also the infected population in the wastewater source in the previous studies crassphage was often detected with good correlations with pathogenic viruses and bacteria in water moreover the observed correlations were likely to depends on the selected crassphage marker in qpcr assay as well as locality further studies are expected to investigate which crassphage marker have a good correlation with each water related pathogens in various locations antimicrobial resistance in environmental waters is also caused by human fecal pollution agramont et al 2020 chen et al 2021 stachler et al 2019 correlation between crassphage and antibiotic resistance genes args has been also reported in sewage impacted urban waterway the qpcr data showed very strong correlation of sul1 sul2 teto tetw mcr1 and emrf with crassphage li et al 2021b makkaew et al 2021 nguyen et al 2021 stachler et al 2019 recently a significant correlation of crassphage and args was reported by metagenomic data sets analysis of publicly available metagenomic data revealed that the abundance of args in environmental waters was highly correlated with presence of crassphage sequence chen et al 2021 karkman et al 2019 recently the concentration of crassphage was also reportedly useful to normalize viral titers of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 in wastewater for wastewater based epidemiology wbe purposes holm et al 2022 green et al 2020 greenwald et al 2021 heijnen et al 2021 medema et al 2020 polo et al 2021 wilder et al 2021 by normalizing with crassphage the virus titer could reflect better the proportion of infected people to total population in the sewershed heijnen et al 2021 wilder et al 2021 overall crassphage has great potential as human fecal indicator to track point and non point sources of human fecal contamination it also has high correlation with both human gut bacteria and viruses significantly the reported shedding of crassphage in feces is often higher than those of other fib and viruses hence higher detection sensitivity is expected in environmental waters even with low level of contamination crassphage has great advantage over other fibs in terms of sensitivity and specificity to human fecal sources as well as persistence in environmental waters however these advantages could be also affected by locality probably due to geographical diversity of crassphage genotypes although crassphage sequence has been found ubiquitously in wastewater metagenome there is strong evidence of geographical dependence and sequence diversity in sewage edwards et al 2019 stachler and bibby 2014 these diversities are probably associated with diversity of human gut microbiomes which varies geographically and temporally david et al 2014 yatsunenko et al 2012 these geographical diversities of crassphage in wastewater and environmental waters have not been fully understood although it could affect the suitability of crassphage markers in the target region to date studies of crassphage in water has been conducted in a limited number of countries investigations from more countries are expected to understand global diversity of crassphage and local applicability of the crassphage markers for the mst purpose association of crassphage with other human enteric viruses should be explored further to enhance application of crassphage as the fecal indicator i e for normalization in wbe wbe is reported to be effective to probe outbreak situation of norovirus poliovirus influenza virus as well as sars cov 2 heijnen and medema 2011 kazama et al 2016 mueller et al 2009 7 crassphage as a performance indicator for viral reduction in wastewater treatment crassphage also has good potential as a performance indicator virus to assess and ensure virus reduction in wastewater treatment processes at wwtps fib i e e coli are often used to monitor reduction of microbes in wastewater however reduction of viruses in wastewater treatment cannot be assessed accurately by fib because reduction mechanism of virus in wastewater treatment is fundamentally different from that of bacteria dias et al 2018 mcminn et al 2017 the requirements for an indicator virus of reduction performance are that i the virus is consistently present at a high concentration in influent wastewater and ii the virus is more persistent in wastewater treatment than the pathogenic viruses of reduction target consistent presence in wastewater is necessary to enable performance assessment at any time independent of the disease outbreak situation in the sewershed in addition in order to evaluate the treatment performance as lrv the virus is expected to have a high enough concentration in influent wastewater where the virus is still present at a detectable concentration in effluent after treatment consistent presence of crassphage in influent wastewater and treated effluent at wwtps have been reported table 2a crassphage is the most prevalent and quantified virus in influent wastewater as well as pmmov farkas et al 2020 the detection range of crassphage generally exceeds the concentration of rotavirus norovirus enterovirus hepatitis e virus and sapovirus farkas et al 2019 2018a 2018b flannery et al 2013 fumian et al 2013 grøndahl rosado et al 2014 hata et al 2014 kitajima et al 2013 kitajima et al 2014 masclaux et al 2013 prevost et al 2015 qiu et al 2015 simmons et al 2011 among 320 untreated wastewater samples crassphage showed the highest positive ratio of 98 314 320 while pmmov hadv and hpyv were detected 95 158 166 93 111 119 and 80 276 345 respectively ahmed et al 2019a 2018a 2018b crank et al 2020 farkas et al 2019 hamza et al 2019 han et al 2014 hewitt et al 2013 kitajima et al 2014 kongprajug et al 2019 levican et al 2019 malla et al 2019a sangkaew et al 2021 schmitz et al 2016 stachler et al 2017 tandukar et al 2020a b wu et al 2020 moreover crassphage in wastewater is constantly detected independent of seasonal variation a year long studies revealed that crassphage was detected constantly higher concentration than the enteric viruses of hadv hpyv and sapovirus in both influent wastewater and treatment effluent ahmed et al 2021a crank et al 2020 farkas et al 2019 wu et al 2020 meanwhile pathogenic viral fecal indicator hadv and hpyv could be more variable depending on population rate of infection in the sewershed ahmed et al 2021a 2019a elmahdy et al 2020 hamza et al 2019 no significant differences were detected in crassphage abundance based on population coverage nor treatment capacity of wwtps crank et al 2020 furthermore crassphage reportedly had less hourly fluctuations than hadv and pmmov in influent wastewater of a wwtp ahmed et al 2021a consequently crassphage has good potential as performance indicator in terms of consistent presence at detectable concentration both in influent wastewater and treatment effluent with low variation on seasonal daily nor hourly factors persistence in wastewater treatment is another requirement for the indicator virus to ensure reduction of the pathogenic viruses of reduction target in wastewater treatment processes if the indicator virus is more persistent than the pathogenic viruses the pathogenic virus are also expected to have greater lrv than the indicator virus thus by maintaining lrv of the indicator virus at the target level we can ensure that lrv of the pathogenic viruses would be better or at least at equal level to the indicator virus the lrv of crassphage in conventional activated sludge process is reported as 1 2 2 9 log10 table 2a farkas et al 2019 kongprajug et al 2019 sangkaew et al 2021 wu et al 2020 while hadv and hpyv have 0 8 3 7 log10 and 1 0 3 7 log10 of lrv respectively hamza et al 2011 hata et al 2013 kitajima et al 2014 sangkaew et al 2021 schmitz et al 2016 sidhu et al 2017 tandukar et al 2020a wu et al 2020 lrv of aichi virus 1 is reported in range of 0 79 2 7 log10 while 1 2 3 7 log10 reduction for norovirus kitajima et al 2013 2014 malla et al 2019a schmitz et al 2016 haramoto et al 2006 since log reduction of crassphage is less variable than other viruses crassphage has good potential as performance indicator for reduction of pathogenic viruses furthermore since crassphage is a dna virus it is potentially persistent than other human enteric viruses which are mostly rna viruses it could be suitable for the long term monitoring of pathogenic viruses in wastewater environmental waters and source tracking for sewage contamination implementation of crassphage as fecal indicator could improve the wbe risk assessment and global human health 8 perspectives fib have long history of application for monitoring and control of waterborne pathogenic bacteria in aquatic environment and wastewater treatment since pcr invention in 1980s the extensive number of research on waterborne viruses have been conducted to understand fate of viruses in water environment and wastewater treatment accompanying with better understanding on fate of pathogenic viruses in water importance of indicator viruses has been emphasized which can be applied for monitoring and control of the pathogenic viruses in environmental waters and wastewater treatment recently both crassphage and pmmov have been expected as the promising candidates of fecal indicator virus according to our extensive review of literature crassphage is globally distributed and have high abundance than other fecal and pathogenic viruses thus crassphage has universally good potential as an indicator virus of human fecal origin in environmental waters its high sensitivity and specificity to human feces also suggest its good potential for application as the mst marker to track the source of human fecal pollution in environmental waters moreover its correlation with pathogenic viruses highlights potential applicability of crassphage as water quality indicator for public health however a molecular based indicator is not directly applicable to quantitative microbial risk assessment but needs careful consideration haas 2020 to this end relations of crassphage with infectious pathogenic viruses needs to be investigated further recently several assays have been developed to quantify potentially infectious viruses with capsid integrity and applied to evaluate intact viruses in water treatment leifels et al 2021 sano et al 2015 cuevas ferrando et al 2022 cuevas ferrando et al 2022 reported that crassphage correlated with some intact capsid viruses of norovirus gi and gii human astrovirus hastv and rotavirus in influent wastewater and norovirus gi and hastv in treated wastewater application of these techniques to the studies in various water bodies could reveal feasibility and limitations of crassphage as a water quality indicator furthermore most of the studies on crassphage in water were conducted in temperate climate regions more studies in tropical and subarctic regions are expected for further understanding of geographical distribution and universal feasibility of crassphage as an indicator virus especially cross reactivity of crassphage marker with animal feces had geographic variations to ensure the specificity of crassphage as human fecal marker assay optimization e g combination with other markers and prior confirmation with reference samples in the target area would be effective understanding of geographical diversity of crassphage genotypes would be helpful for selection of the crassphage assay appropriate to the target area our review on wastewater treatment studies revealed that crassphage is also potentially available as a performance indicator of virus reduction in wastewater treatment processes crassphage is highly abundant in influent wastewater of wwtps independent of seasonal fluctuations and disease outbreak situations in the sewershed importantly crassphage is more persistent in wastewater treatment than most pathogenic viruses therefore maintaining lrv of crassphage can ensure reduction performance of the pathogenic viruses which are mostly more vulnerable in wastewater treatment application of crassphage as the performance indicator would be useful to secure safety in water reclamation especially when the reclaimed water is used for the direct drinking purpose however studies of crassphage on its reduction in water reclamation is quite limited to date water reclamation is often composed of membrane filtration and disinfection processes further investigation is needed on lrvs of crassphage and their relations with those of pathogenic viruses in various settings of membrane i e uf nanofiltration reverse osmosis membrane fouling stage etc and disinfection i e chlorination ozonation and ultraviolet processes since discovery of crassphage in 2014 scientific knowledge on crassphage in wastewater is still being developed by filling research gaps addressed in this review crasspahge would be more powerful and useful tool for water quality management to secure public health 9 conclusions crassphage is globally distributed in wastewaters and various fecal contaminated water bodies at high concentrations without seasonal fluctuations crassphage is highly specific to human fecal contamination and is rarely found in animal feces it also has a good potential as a performance indicator to ensure virus reduction in wastewater treatment systems accordingly crassphage could be an effective tool for monitoring of human fecal contamination and potential presence of fecal pathogenic microbes in environmental waters although remarkable progress in recent studies on crassphage in wastewaters and environmental waters further research is expected to fill the following research gaps i relations of crassphage with infectious pathogenic viruses especially to clarify the effectiveness of crassphage in quantitative microbial risk assessment ii geographical distribution of crassphage in tropical and subarctic regions to vefiry universal feasibility of crassphage as an indicator virus and iii fate and reduction of crassphage in water reclamation processes particularly on relations of reduction between crassphage and other pathogenic viruses bridging these research gaps would make crassphage a powerful tool to support the control of water related health risks credit authorship contribution statement

15711,driven by the electric vehicle revolution a sharp increase in lithium li demand as a result of the need to produce li ion batteries is expected in coming years to enable a sustainable li supply there is an urgent need to develop cost effective and environmentally friendly methods to extract li from a variety of sources including li rich salt lake brines seawater and wastewaters while the prevalent lime soda evaporation method is suitable for the mass extraction of li from brine sources with low mg li ratios it is time consuming 1 year and typically exhibits low li recovery electrochemically based methods have emerged as promising processes to recover li given their ease of management limited requirement for additional chemicals minimal waste production and high selectivity towards li this state of the art review provides a comprehensive overview of current advances in two key electrochemical li recovery technologies electrosorption and electrodialysis with particular attention given to advances in understanding of mechanism materials operational modes and system configurations we highlight the most pressing challenges these technologies encounter including i limited electrode capacity poor electrode stability and co insertion of impurity cations in the electrosorption process and ii limited li selectivity of available ion exchange membranes ion leakage and membrane scaling in the electrodialysis process we then systematically describe potentially effective strategies to overcome these challenges and further provide future perspectives

sf technology readiness level trl united states geological survey usgs 1 introduction lithium li as the lightest metal on earth holds an increasingly important position in numerous fields in the 21st century the remarkable properties of li facilitate its use in products such as batteries glasses ceramics greases chemical reagents pharmaceuticals and nuclear fuels attention on li was heightened by the discovery in 1913 of its energy storage properties lewis and keyes 1913 the past thirty years has witnessed continuous growth in global li demand as a result particularly of the dramatic increase in production of li ion batteries libs blomgren 2016 which are widely used for powering electric vehicles and in grid storage applications over the last 5 years the proportion of li consumed for battery production has risen from 35 to 65 with the amount required for this application now on the order of 35 000 tonnes per annum u s geological survey 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 if the current annual growth rate of 32 is maintained it is predicted that the amount required will reach 174 000 tonnes in 2025 with demand expected to outstrip production by early 2022 choubey et al 2016 tabelin et al 2021 as li plays a more important and potentially irreplaceable role in sustainable energy development exploitation of li resources in a cost effective and sustainable manner is of particular urgency the united states geological survey usgs reports that there are about 86 million tonnes of identified reserves of total natural li resources worldwide with li distributed in diverse natural environments including mineral deposits 40 and water bodies 60 kavanagh et al 2018 there were about 82 000 tonnes of lithium produced in 2021 with more than 90 of the li in the global market supplied by australia chile argentina and china murodjon et al 2020 tabelin et al 2021 u s geological survey 2020 compared to mineral lithium resources especially in the forms of pegmatite cookeite taeniolite and lithiophorite exploitation of li rich brine sources is considered to be a promising approach in view of the relatively lower environmental impact swain 2017 tabelin et al 2021 the total lithium content in natural water bodies e g salt lake brines and seawater is much larger than that present in li ore bodies and recovery of li from aqueous sources is easier than mining of mineral resources particularly those dominated by low li content minerals these facts suggest that one important way to address the potential li shortage is to develop cost effective technologies for li extraction from li rich aqueous solutions tabelin et al 2021 as such this review will focus on li extraction technologies from waters such as salt lake brines geothermal waters and seawater in view of the relative abundance of li in these water types solar evaporation with subsequent precipitation in purpose built ponds is widely used for commercial li production from li rich salt lakes in chile and argentina swain 2017 the process involves solar evaporation concentration chemical precipitation purification and carbonation an et al 2012 while this process is suitable for the mass li extraction from brine sources it is time consuming 1 year evaporation with a low recovery efficiency in addition the chemical composition of salt lakes at different geographical locations is highly variable table 1 li 0 1 3 6 mg 3 5 12 1 na 39 3 92 1 conventional methods are not applicable to lake brines with high mg li ratio 6 because more precipitant will be consumed to remove mg leading to the production of substantial quantities of residual waste lee et al 2013 zhao et al 2013b in such cases alternative technologies have been proposed to enhance li separation purification and recovery including liquid liquid extraction zhou et al 2011 use of ion exchange resins bukowsky et al 1991 nishihama et al 2011 ion sieve adsorption ooi et al 1986 and nanofiltration wen et al 2006 unfortunately each of these technologies suffers from its own intrinsic limitations for instance membrane technologies such as nanofiltration involve high energy consumption large capital cost and the possibility of severe membrane fouling ion sieve adsorption materials often exhibit poor permeability and high dissolution rates in acid but more viable products have recently been developed and are being successfully trialled at pilot scale lithium south development corporation 2021 liu et al 2019b vulcan energy resources limited 2021 xu et al 2020a in view of these limitations particular attention over the last 30 years has been given to the possible use of electrochemical techniques for li recovery with research into areas such as electrosorption and electrodialysis leading to a series of breakthroughs including synthesis of novel electrode materials and membranes and innovation with regard to configuration and operational mode as evidence of this growing interest the number of publication in this field has increased to over 130 since 2010 taking advantage of the electric field only the minority constituents i e charged ions of the brine can be selectively removed in an electrochemical system whereas conventional solar evaporation or membrane separation removes or rejects the majority constituent i e water with heat sources or pressure pumps as such electrochemically based technologies might be expected to exhibit particular benefits with respect to ease of management minimal waste production and more importantly high selectivity and recovery towards li particular attention in recent years has been given to the use of electrochemical technologies for recovery of a portion of the 230 billion tonnes of li present in seawater arroyo et al 2019 chitrakar et al 2001 guo et al 2018 hong et al 2018 hoshino 2013 2015 joo et al 2020b kim et al 2015a ryu et al 2019 um and hirato 2014 yang et al 2018 however compared to the high li content of salt lake brines 0 2 1 6 g l 1 the concentration of li in seawater is extremely low at 0 17 mg l 1 resulting in much higher production costs kavanagh et al 2018 herein we critically review recent advances in two electrochemically based li recovery technologies electrosorption and electrodialysis in section 2 we introduce fundamental details of electrosorption including its principles cell architecture and electrode materials battistel et al 2020 calvo 2019 liu et al 2019b zhao et al 2019b in section 3 we summarize the principles membrane types and operational modes of electrodialysis we then highlight the most pressing restrictions and challenges these technologies encounter in practical application and introduce potential strategies to resolve these challenges finally we conclude this review by providing some perspectives on likely future developments particularly regarding the translation of bench scale studies to pilot full scale trials and finally to industrial applications 2 li recovery by electrosorption based processes 2 1 principle of electrosorption in this review we employ the term electrosorption to refer to the process whereby charged ions in bulk phase are retained by solid phase electrodes by an electrostatic force this process is also referred to as electrochemical ion pumping in some studies palagonia et al 2017 siekierka et al 2018a trocoli et al 2016 trócoli et al 2017 in an electrosorption system ions can be captured through either faradaic processes or non faradaic processes non faradaic processes involve the storage of ions in the electric double layers edl at the interface between the electrodes and electrolyte however capacitive electrodes made from materials such as porous carbon do not possess specific selectivity to li ions unless the material is modified or selective ion exchange membranes iem are present therefore non faradaic processes are often applied in water desalination where ion selectivity is not required with capacitive porous carbon electrodes used for reversible anion adsorption and desorption kim et al 2015b shang et al 2021 siekierka et al 2018a zhao et al 2020c the key point of faradaic processes is that there is transfer of ionic or electronic charge across the electrical double layer at the interface between the electrode and contacting solid or liquid electrolyte that serves as an electron reservoir with these phases accepting or donating electrons application of a faradaic process for recovery of li was first reported by kanoh et al 1991 and involved the use of a λ mno2 pt electrode system however the system exhibited high energy cost and large ph fluctuation subsequently a wide variety of cathode and anode materials have been proposed for li recovery with systems using these electrode materials enabling ion uptake by one of four possible uptake mechanisms fig 1 i ion uptake by insertion and ii conversion reactions iii ion binding with electroactive polymer and iv ion removal by charge compensation of redox active electrolytes srimuk et al 2020 2 1 1 ion insertion reactions ion insertion or intercalation is at the core of selective li capture via electrosorption based systems fig 1a to achieve this a li precursor is firstly synthesized by introducing li into metal oxide compounds li is then removed from the lattice structure of the prepared li precursor by electrochemical treatment or acid treatment for a definite time creating vacant sites in the crystal skeleton that can subsequently be used to re capture li the small size of the vacant sites restricts non li cation insertion into these sites correspondingly for the electrochemical treatment the electronic charge is transferred to the circuit oxidizing the transition metal in the electrode for acid treatment the electrodes undergo redox reaction and ion exchange with h resulting in delithiation and an increase in the oxidation state of the transition metals by far the most widely reported li selective electrodes are those involving lifepo4 lfp and limn2o4 lmo ternary lithium materials and hybrid metal polymer materials du et al 2016a lawagon et al 2018 lee et al 2013 trócoli et al 2014 the prussian blue anode nickel hexacyanoferrate nihcf could also serve as an alternative to the expensive ag counter electrode that has been extensively used in previous studies this type of faradaic electrode preferentially intercalates na k but has low affinity to li palagonia et al 2017 2019 2020 trócoli et al 2015 trocoli et al 2016 trócoli et al 2017 xie et al 2020 when li is captured by li selective electrode na k is released from nihcf to solution for electro neutrality 2 1 2 conversion reactions metallic electrodes when used as the counter electrode undergo phase conversion from the metallic state to a new phase in order to maintain charge balance for instance accompanied with the li capture ag agcl bi biocl conversion reactions occur resulting in removal of cl from solution fig 1b kim et al 2018 lee et al 2013 trócoli et al 2014 zhao et al 2021 and zn zn2 reaction occurs for maintaining the charge balance kim et al 2018 in addition lithium metallic electrodes have been used to recover metallic lithium from electrolyte directly via reduction of li to li metal bae et al 2016 yang et al 2018 2 1 3 surface redox reactions electroactive polymers such as the conducting polymers polyaniline pani and polypyrrole ppy can be used as materials for counter electrode to capture and release anions such as cl fig 1c charge injection withdrawal strongly affects the reduction oxidation state of electroactive polymers for example the ppy modified electrode undergoes redox reaction ppy ncl ne ppyn ncl with reversible uptake release of cl in the li extraction process missoni et al 2016 zhao et al 2019a however cation exchange can also take place on electrodes on which ppy is combined with large counterions such as polystyrene sulfonate pssn for example the ppy pss composite was incorporated on the surface of an λ mno2 electrode in order to enhance li ion exchange rate with the λ mno2 electrode found to selectively capture li du et al 2016a 2 1 4 electrolyte redox reactions reversible redox couples present in the electrolyte solution can serve as the counter electrode to facilitate redox reactions involved in li capture e g engagement of the i i3 redox couple as a liquid electrode to balance charge transfer fig 1d kim et al 2015a moreover charge compensation can also be applied when the redox couple such as fe cn 6 3 fe cn 6 4 is not directly involved with li capture discharge but can be used to accept or donate electrons at the electrolyte electrode interface kim et al 2021 kim et al 2020a this mechanism enables fast electron transfer and provides greater charge storage 2 2 architectures and operation of the electrosorption systems four types of cell architecture are usually used for li electroadsorption in a flow by cell one of the most prevalent designs of electrochemical cells two parallel flat plate electrodes are vertically immersed into li containing brine and connected with a power supply fig 2 a the flow by electrosorption system typically follows a four step operation fig 2e i application of a potential difference between the li capture electrode and the counter electrode to selectively extract li from the feed stream ii flushing of the cell electrode with distilled water iii reversal of electrode polarity to release li into the recovery solution iv flushing of the spacer chamber with distilled water to completely remove the residual li adsorption in flow by systems is diffusion limited due to the presence of a thick boundary layer 100 μm and limited accessibility of the active sites within the electrodes donaghue and chaplin 2013 palagonia et al 2017 in contrast the use of a flow through cell where the water passes through a porous electrode greatly enhances the ion adsorption efficiency fig 2b palagonia et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a this enhancement can be attributed to the convective transport of water through the pores of the electrodes which results in a decrease in the diffusional boundary layer thickness to a scale comparable to the pore radius and leads to the full use of the active sites of the electrodes use of an anode separator cathode sandwich assembly in flow through configuration is expected to further reduce the internal resistance as no water channel is required between the two electrodes marchini et al 2018 mu et al 2021 romero et al 2021 romero et al 2020 a rocking chair design based on the concept of the classical rocking chair like libs has also been proposed for li recovery systems guo et al 2020 han et al 2020 joo et al 2020a liu et al 2019a xu et al 2021 zhao et al 2017 zhao et al 2013b a rocking chair cell is composed of two symmetrical li capture electrodes separated by an anion exchange membrane aem this system accomplishes capture release of li within each half cell concurrently without extra electrode regeneration step fig 2c and f to overcome the discontinuity and enhance the adsorption capacity of the conventional electrosorption systems novel fluidic electrochemical configurations inspired by redox flow batteries and supercapacitors have been proposed in these systems flowable particles were used as the li adsorption electrodes instead of static electrodes fig 2d kim et al 2021 kim et al 2020a yu et al 2020 redox couples can be added to the electrolyte to enhance electron transfer between the particle electrodes the most distinctive benefit of flow electrode systems is the ease of management e g regeneration and or replacement of the electrodes and the possibility to achieve continuous operation although the selectivity towards li capture needs further improvement ha et al 2019 kim et al 2021 2 3 electrode materials electrodes are at the heart of an electrochemical li adsorption system in the past two decades a number of li electroadsorption electrodes have been developed in this section we will provide a brief introduction of these electrodes 2 3 1 lfp electrodes lithium iron phosphate lifepo4 lfp also classified as a polyanionic material was first synthesized in 1996 padhi et al 1997 in the lattice structure of lfp li and fe are located at octahedral 4a and 4c sites respectively while p occupies the tetrahedral 4c site yuan et al 2011 the lio6 and feo6 sheets are arrayed in parallel and are linked together with po4 as shown in fig 3 a the intercalation of li results in a reduction of fe iii centres to fe ii and a change in phase with the reaction expressed as 1 l i 1 x fe 1 x ii fe x iii p o 4 xl i x e lif e ii p o 4 where the stoichiometric coefficient x is between 0 and 1 fepo4 fp and lifepo4 phases may coexist in the lfp structure until the material has been fully de lithiated in a typical cyclic voltammetry cv curve of the lfp electrode fig 3b only one cathodic and one anodic peak appear corresponding to the li intercalation and deintercalation processes accompanying the fe2 fe3 redox transformation examination of li diffusion coefficients during this transformation reveal that lithiation is more difficult than delithiation zhao et al 2013b lfp is noted for its good stability and reversibility long cycle life low cost and environmentally benign nature however lfp possesses intrinsically poor ionic diffusion and electronic conductivity due to its 1d channel structure amin et al 2006 surface coating and structure modifications are plausible approaches to overcome these limitations han et al 2020 kim et al 2015a sun et al 2020 kim et al 2015a proposed that lfp could be modified via carbon coating and hydrophilic polydopamine pd coating to improve its electrical conductivity and wettability thereby increasing the ion concentration and mobility around the electrode fig 3c and providing more energy for li to overcome the energy barrier of insertion another interesting possibility is to create abundant pores 5 20 μm by modifying the lfp electrode with polyethylene glycol fig 3d and e thereby creating additional channels for the water to pass through and facilitate li transport and adsorption fig 3f sun et al 2020 such a honeycomb like structure was shown to enhance the li uptake capacity by 57 and reached the adsorption equilibrium within 1 5 h another noteworthy drawback of lfp electrodes is the co insertion of impurity ions pasta et al 2012 investigated the effects of li na ratios from 1 100 to 1 10 000 and found that li capture was diffusion controlled by the li concentration in brine while higher potential led to fast li intercalation rapid li depletion around the electrode occurred resulting in the capture of secondary ions later studies showed that the preferential co insertion order of the lfp electrode was li na k mg2 he et al 2018 liu et al 2015 liu et al 2014 zhao et al 2013a zhao et al 2013b he et al 2018 reported that a lower range of operating voltage 1 1v of the lfp electrode was found to be optimal in avoiding h2 o2 generation rapid li depletion and ion co insertion the system could successfully reduce the ratio of mg li from 60 to 0 45 but long operation times 600 min per cycle in this study were required as a result of the low ion removal rate at the preferred lower operating potentials he et al 2018 in addition a 16 capacity loss was still observed for the lfp electrode after 50 cycles of continuous operation 2 3 2 lmo electrodes spinel type lithium manganese oxide material limn2o4 lmo belongs to the cubic crystal structure with space group fd3m thirty two oxygen atoms reside at the 32e sites of each unit cell and form a face centered cubic close packing fccp structure eight li atoms are located at the tetrahedral 8a sites and 16 mn atoms at octahedral 16d sites fig 4 a missoni et al 2016 the inner structure of the material is characterized by 3d channels that enable li to diffuse through the material kanoh et al 1995 the peaks in the cv fig 4b indicate two transition states at each anodic and cathodic half curve which can be described by the following reactions 2 2 λ m n iv o 2 05 l i 0 5 e l i 0 5 m n iii m n iv o 4 3 l i 0 5 m n iii m n iv o 4 0 5 l i 0 5 e limn 2 iii o 4 where peak pairs a2 a1 and c2 c1 correspond to li insertion and release shown in eq 2 and eq 3 respectively by combining eqs 2 and 3 the complete lithiation process can be expressed as 4 l i 1 x mn 1 x iii m n iv o 4 xl i x e lim n iii m n iv o 4 where the value of the stoichiometric coefficient x is between 0 and 1 compared to the lfp electrode lmo electrode is found to have faster li ion transport rate higher li adsorption capacity selectivity more stable structure and no obvious na mg co intercalation nevertheless lmo electrodes still suffer from obvious performance deterioration during prolonged operation for example the capacity of lmo zn system reduced to 73 after 100 cycles of operation kim et al 2018 xu et al 2018 later studies attempted to improve structure stability of the lmo electrode in multiple ways with respect to material modifications for example by employing λ mno2 nanoparticles fig 4c trócoli et al 2017 or 1d λ mno2 nanorods fig 4d xie et al 2020 both li uptake capacity and electrode recyclability can be greatly improved as a result of the accelerated rate of electron transfer and larger surface to volume ratio lmo electrode surface can also be coated with the protective layer such as ppy al2o3 or zro2 film to stabilize its structure while increasing li ion mobility on the surface fang et al 2022 guan et al 2011 luo et al 2022 zhao et al 2020b in addition a 3d porous structure lmo film consisting of lmo nanorods rgo nanosheets and ca alginate hydrogel was found to have high electrode stability 98 3 capacity after 100 cycles and superior li recovery capacity 32 7 mg g 1 fig 4e zhang et al 2021 the novel composite film can provide abundant 3d channels for fast li diffusion rate and the use of ca alginate can avoid restacking and aggregation of rgo sheets and improve the stability of lmo nanorods 2 3 3 lncm electrodes lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide lncm another promising cathode candidate has been reported to have higher theoretical li uptake capacity 71 95 mg g 1 and extraordinary charge discharge property than normal lmo and lfp electrode shang et al 2021 during the charge discharge processes only ni2 and co3 are electrochemically active whereas mn4 plays an important role in the stability of the crystal structure li et al 2013 while ni co and mn leakage from the lncm electrodes to the receiving solution was extremely low physical loss of electrode materials during electrode placement and solution transfer still occur leading to a gradual increase in energy consumption from 1 55 to 4 99 wh mol 1 li and cycling degradation during prolonged operation lawagon et al 2018 to address this issue rgo gauze was used to wrap the lini0 6co0 2mn0 2o2 by co precipitation and hydrothermal reduction forming a novel core shell structured microsphere fig 4f zhao et al 2020a the graphene gauze provided protection for the lncm electrode and effectively mitigated the transformation of the electrode from a layer structure to a spinel structure and avoided the probability of lncm lattice collapse after long term operation the effect of rgo coating became more pronounce when the discharge rate increased from 0 2 c to 10 c the capacity of rgo lncm electrode reduced to 81 4 for 30 cycles at the discharging rate of 10 c but the bare lncm electrode only remained 70 capacity 2 3 4 hybrid metal polymer electrode although the ion sieving materials introduced above have specific selectivity towards li they usually suffer from poor conductivity and low stability modification of the electrodes by electroactive polymers can help address these issues du et al 2016b srimuk et al 2020 fang et al 2022 and wang et al 2019a measured the li diffusion rate of the modifed electrode and proved that ppy coating enhanced li diffusion coefficient of λ mno2 electrode due to faster electron transfer rate of the electroactive materials du et al 2016a imprinted the pss ppy copolymer as a conductive cross linking agent on the core shell structure of λ mno2 to improve electron transfer and cation exchange though selective li capture was primarily achieved by λ mno2 fig 4g to i this electrode exhibited extremely high ion exchange capacity ideal selectivity and rapid equilibrium time i e 2 h 3 li recovery by electrodialysis based processes electrodialysis ed is an electrochemical membrane separation technology that has been widely used in brackish water desalination water softening and wastewater treatment ed has been recognized as an easily scaled up technology in recovery of li from a broad range of sources such as salt lake seawater brine geothermal water leaching solution of ore concentrate and spent li ion battery leachate gmar and chagnes 2019 swain 2017 conventional ed is fabricated by inserting multiple pairs of aem and cem alternately between one pair of anode and cathode thus forming multiple concentrate desalting chambers under the driving force of an electric field cations and anions in solution are transported through oppositely charged ion exchange membranes iems but rejected by the same charge iems leading to ion accumulation in the concentrate chambers and depletion in the dilute chambers respectively in this section we will introduce four types of electrodialysis system for lithium separation including selective electrodialysis sed liquid membrane electrodialysis lmed bipolar membrane electrodialysis bmed and superionic conductor electrodialysis sced 3 1 electrodialysis with selective iem to enable efficient li separation from high mg li ratio brine monovalent selective iems are normally utilized to replace the standard iems in ed systems fig 5 a standard iems have no selectivity towards mono or divalent ions in contrast special grade iems are selective to monovalent ions over divalent ions rijnaarts et al 2019 monovalent selective iems function with the assistance of i charge rejection where a thin oppositely charged layer is used to hinder the permeation of divalent cations zhao et al 2016 and ii a crosslinked layer through which transport of divalent ions with their larger hydrated ion size is hindered sata 2007 with these particular iems ed has been shown to be technically and potentially economically feasible in achieving li separation from multinary mixtures with high mg li ratio nie et al 2017b also reported that li separation using sed was technically and economically feasible with the mg li mass ratio decreasing from 150 to 10 and a li recovery efficiency of 95 3 achieved under optimal operating conditions nie et al 2017a note that a small fraction of free hydrated mg will convert to mgcl with larger radius and less charge density resulting in less mg leakage it should be noted however that other monovalent cations e g k and na will compete more strongly than mg2 and ca2 with li with respect to migration through the monovalent selective cem chen et al 2018 high levels of coexisting ions could lead to low current efficiency excessive energy consumption and low li recovery efficiency nevertheless higher concentration of anions such as so4 2 and hco3 can beneficially immobilize mg migration by forming mgso4 and mg hco3 chen et al 2018 ji et al 2018 3 2 electrodialysis with bipolar membrane in addition to monovalent iems novel bipolar membranes bpm can also be incorporated into electrodialysis systems for li recovery in what is known as bipolar membrane electrodialysis bmed fig 5b the bpm has a sandwich like structure and is composed of an aem a cem and an intermediate hydrophilic layer in which water molecules dissociate to h and oh with the aid of bpm the electrodialyzer can be designed for the dual purposes of li separation and acid e g h3bo3 and hcl alkali e g lioh production afifah et al 2018 iizuka et al 2013 the first application of bipolar membranes in an ed system was in the production of lioh and multiple types of acids hwang et al 2016 jiang et al 2014 firstly the brine was pre concentrated via a conventional ed process and na2co3 was added to the concentrated stream to produce a li2co3 solution this li2co3 solution was then pumped to the bmed cell where lioh was produced jiang et al 2014 the author estimated that only 8 kwh was required to produce one kilogram of lioh when 0 18 m feed concentration of li2co3 solution was used with an applied current density of 30 ma cm 2 another application for bmed is to produce lioh and h3bo3 from geothermal water during the operation boron is first converted to charged b oh 4 due to the in situ generated alkali which can migrate through the aem and form neutral h3bo3 in the acid compartment under an optimal voltage of 30 v bmed could recover 50 b and 62 li with the separation efficiencies reaching 86 9 and 94 7 i̇pekçi et al 2018 a recent study showed that bmed could be used to convert low value li3po4 into high value lioh products while recycling h3po4 wei et al 2022 the solvent h3po4 was firstly used to dissolve solid li3po4 in the salt chamber and the generated li and po4 3 then formed lioh and h3po4 in the neighboring base and acid chambers respectively with passage through the aem and cem the highest li recovery was 99 and the energy consumption was 12 989 kwh kg 1 lioh at a current density of 40 ma cm 2 however due to the existence of large diameter ion channels and poor adhesion of aem and cem layers unwanted co ion leakage or back diffusion through the bpm resulted in a lower purity of product for example at high acid concentration salt anions e g cl from the acid compartment could transport through the bpm and contaminate the produced base lioh and vice versa wilhelm et al 2001 additionally back diffusion of b oh 4 and li ions from the acid base chamber to the salt chamber could occur at high applied potential i̇pekçi et al 2018 in addition the commercial bpm typically has higher resistance and membrane cost than monopolar membranes making it more energy consuming and less economically attractive blommaert et al 2021 pärnamäe et al 2021 3 3 electrodialysis with liquid membrane in addition to conventional solid phase membranes liquid membranes lm have been developed for li selective separation on the basis of liquid liquid extraction in a technology known as liquid membrane electrodialysis lmed fig 5c liu et al 2020b zhao et al 2019c the sandwiched lm is composed of two cems and a li loaded liquid film tributyl phosphate tbp and clo4 composite has been shown to be an effective organic liquid film with the mg li ratio reduced from 100 to 2 and other impurity cations e g na k mg2 and ca2 being effectively separated zhao et al 2019c other lm such as pp13 tfsi n methyl n propylpiperidium bis trifluoromethane sulfonyl imide has also been shown to exhibit high li affinity and good resistance to other coexisting cations with less than 1 na and mg leakage hoshino 2013 while ionic liquids possess excellent properties such as thermal stability high li selectivity and low volatilization solvent leakage and membrane swelling could occur and affect separation efficiency after long term operation li et al 2019 in addition high toxicity of ionic liquids can have negative impacts on the environment and high production cost is another obstacle hampering their extensive use 3 4 electrodialysis with superconductor membrane an ionic superconductor membrane was first reported by fig 5d hoshino 2013 2015 subsequently a solar powered electrodialysis prototype incorporated with ionic superconductor li1 xalyge2 y po4 3 nasicon was designed to continuously extract li from seawater yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 li was transported from seawater 0 1 0 2 mg l 1 li through the solid membrane to the cathode where li was reduced to metallic li after 1 h operation under a current density of 240 μa cm 2 the rate of li production of the cell was around 5 7 mg dm 2 h 1 a more recent study has demonstrated that a dense glass type li0 33la0 56tio3 llto material is able to enrich li in red sea water from 0 21 mg l 1 to 9000 mg l 1 after 5 stage concentration 100 h the membrane showed an exceedingly high li mg selectivity of 6090 and good stability after 2000 h operation the purity of the final recovered li3po4 product was 99 li et al 2021 however the high cost of solid superionic conductor may restrict the practical application of this technology 4 current challenges and strategies of electrochemical processes on li recovery 4 1 perspectives on electrosorption based processes a summary of the li capture performance of various electrosorpotion systems is provided in table 2 although the past decade has witnessed great advances in electrosorption based technologies for li recovery many challenges still exist in this section we will first introduce the most urgent issues regarding electrosorpotion systems including capacity limitation li selectivity counter electrode selection long term stability of the system and feasibility of scale up section 5 2 subsequently possible strategies to overcome these hurdles will be discussed 4 1 1 capacity limitation of electrodes as shown in fig 6 a li adsorption capacity has increased by 3 5 times over the last three decades as a result of ongoing breakthroughs in electrode development for example the li capture rate of the lncm electrode can reach as high as 70 mg g 1 h 1 with a li adsorption capacity of 35 mg g 1 nearly an order of magnitude higher than those of the normal lfp and lmo electrodes fig 6b while these achievements are impressive they are still far from satisfactory for real implementation a common strategy to further increase electrode adsorption capacity and charge transfer is to optimize the electrode preparation these optimization methods include ball milling kim et al 2020b pore forming liu et al 2021 sun et al 2020 nanosizing trócoli et al 2017 xie et al 2020 element doping lawagon et al 2018 siekierka et al 2018b zhao et al 2020c and coating with organic or inorganic materials fang et al 2022 luo et al 2022 wang et al 2019b zhang et al 2021 zhao et al 2020a zhao et al 2020b note that while the performance of the electrodes can be enhanced through these optimization processes the costs of electrode production are anticipated to increase accordingly choosing an appropriate voltage current range in the discharging and charging steps can enhance the actual charge capacity of the li capture electrode narrowing of the potential window can avoid h2 o2 generation and increase electrode stability if the applied current is too high rapid li depletion near the electrode surface results in poor mass transfer from the electrolyte which leads to lower li adsorption capacity and possibly co insertion of other ions such as mg2 one strategy is for the discharging step appropriate increase in the current could accelerate electrode desorption without imparting obvious negative impacts on electrode capacity trócoli et al 2017 the electrical potential in the charging step can be maintained at a low level to avoid rapid li depletion but at the expense of slow li recovery rate liu et al 2015 for example kim et al 2019 confirmed that a strategy that uses consecutive multi stage operation combined with staged current control 10 μa cm 2 in adsorption step and 0 2 ma cm 2 in desorption was optimal for treating seawater concentrate 0 34 mg l 1 li furthermore there is typically a trade off between the operational condition e g applied current and initial li concentration and system response e g li adsorption capacity and recovery rate this trade off has been demonstrated in studies by kim et al 2020b who showed that current density and li concentration are two important limiting factors determining the utilization percentage of λ mno2 which in turn directly controls the usable li capacity of the electrode fig 6c and d based on these insights we postulate that relatively high current density can be used in high li concentration source waters resulting in rapid li recovery for example for common li concentration 20 50 mm in salt lake brine the li adsorption capacity of the lmo electrode is more than 20 mg g 1 at a current density of 100 ma g 1 whereas it would reduce to only 4 mg g 1 in 5 mm li brine under the same conditions kim et al 2020b in addition the recovery rate the ratio between the amount of recovered li and the amount of li included in the brine needs to be considered for practical use of an electrosorption based lithium recovery system although many studies have witnessed high selectivity of the system to lithium few studies have focused on improving the recovery rate as the amount of brine is limited the recovery rate would be closely related to the amount of li we can extract from the brine therefore improvement in the li capacity of the electrode and efficient reactor design need to be considered to increase the recovery rate of the system however after recovering a certain amount of lithium the lithium recovery rate must be lowered by reducing the applied current density in view of the reduction in mass transfer that is induced by the decrease in lithium concentration also more energy would be consumed for the process because of the increase in resistance therefore it would be necessary to optimize the recovery rate to recover lithium with the highest efficiency and economic feasibility considering that the final lithium products should ideally be solid li2co3 or lioh additional processes e g evaporation precipitation and crystallization are required after the electrosorption process therefore obtaining the recovery solution with a high li concentration is of great importance to improving the overall recovery rate and reducing operating costs along with developing high capacity electrodes and optimizing operating modes proper reactor design is critical for example using a flow electrode system could be beneficial from this standpoint because it can maximize the electrode to liquid ratio ha et al 2019 kim et al 2021 4 1 2 li selectivity of the electrodes one of the greatest strengths of the electrosorption system is that the li capture electrode has high preferential affinity towards li over other competitive ions including na k mg2 and ca2 it is commonly claimed in the literature that co intercalation of impurity ions into the lmo electrode is limited nevertheless we note in some studies that a small fraction of the impurity ions does leak into the recovery solution kim et al 2019 lee et al 2013 siekierka et al 2018b zhao et al 2019a zhao et al 2017 one reason for this leakage could be that competing cations co adsorb on the electrode and then desorb into the recovery solution marchini et al 2016 indeed previous publications do report the co intercalation of impurity ions in the lfp electrode causing irreversible capacity loss for li capture he et al 2018 kim et al 2015a pasta et al 2012 another possibility is that the cell rinse to remove residual ions after the charging process was inadequate with these ions subsequently being introduced to the concentrate stream during the discharging process although li capture electrodes are effective for mining li rich lake brine the problem of na interference remains a challenge to li extraction from seawater where the li na molar ratio is on the order of 5 10 5 a pulsed lithiation operational mode has been proposed as one means of improving li na selectivity of lfp from seawater mining liu et al 2020a due to different diffusion rates of li and na the addition of the rest period enabled li and na to redistribute within the electrode thus improving electrode homogeneity and reducing intercalation overpotential fig 6e the reverse pulsed period facilitated release of more na and li these measures created a uniform concentration front in the vicinity of the electrode which alleviated li depletion reduced concentration polarization and resulted in an enhancement in li na selectivity from 1 2 to 1 1 fig 6f one issue that hinders the effective comparison of li selectivity of different electrodes is the use of different selectivity performance metrics as shown in table 2 one commonly reported metric in previous studies is the ratio of concentration of li and that of another cation m in the recovery solution 5 k l i m c l i r c m s a distribution coefficient can be defined for each component as the ratio of its concentration in the recovery solution to that in the source solution i e for li and another ion m we have 6 k l i c l i r c l i s k m c m r c m s for systems in which thermodynamic equilibrium is established between the two phases these quantities would just be the partition coefficients for the different ions no such attribution can be given here because the relative concentrations depend on a number of different processing conditions and the recovery and source solutions are not in thermodynamic equilibrium nonetheless we can define a separation factor sf to provide a metric for the overall effectiveness of the li enrichment process 7 s f k l i k m c l i c m r c l i c m s as shown this quantity can also be expressed as the ratio of the relative concentrations of the li and the contaminating ion m in the recovery solution to their relative concentrations in the source solution thanks to the extremely high intrinsic selectivity to li of the electrodes the magnitude of sf in the electrosorption based li recovery system is determined principally by the initial composition of the brine and not by the electrode performance therefore sf could vary from 1 to a few thousand table 2 even using the same li capturing electrode which makes it hard to compare effective sf values between different systems on the other hand k li m shows the quality of the final recovery solution which is likely to be a critical determinant of the purity of the final lithium products however the particular types of ions that are present in the recovery solution will differ depending on the composition of the initial brine therefore the li purity p li defined as the percentage of li in the final recovery solution provides a more intuitive measure of recovery performance we recommend in the future that investigators include p li in their evaluation of performance and that the applied conditions and initial li concentration also always be provided 4 1 3 significance of counter electrodes the use of an appropriate counter electrode is of equal significance to li recovery performance and the overall cost as the li capturing electrode the conventional battery system generally consists of a li capturing electrode e g lfp and a cl capturing counter electrode with materials such as ag used for anion capture in small scale studies the high cost and the low stability of ag limit the use of this material in full scale reactors with considerable effort invested in finding cost effective alternatives for example trocoli et al 2016 substituted it with a low cost and environmentally friendly nihcf electrode as a li exclusion and na k capturing electrode as mentioned in section 2 1 2 this innovative system showed similar energy consumption as that observed in the ag system more importantly the impurities that might be introduced during the operation can be removed further increasing the purity of li however the initial concentration of na k in the recovery solution should be carefully selected to obtain the li solution in high purity polymeric materials such as pani and ppy have been widely used as counter electrodes in li recovery systems and shown to be effective in capturing cl though their stability over long term operation is questionable for example the charge capacity of pani showed a 40 degradation after 100 cycles zhao et al 2019a and ppy material has been reported to exhibit similar degradation problems though further evaluation is required missoni et al 2016 in addition the interaction of these materials with other anions such as so4 2 is unclear trócoli 2021 for practical applications careful comparison between the performance of different counter electrodes is necessary with an overall evaluation regarding key performance metrics such as capacity stability and economic feasibility required also the development of new types of counter electrodes should be encouraged with particular attention given to the feasibility of use at large scale and over extended periods of operation 4 1 4 long term stability electrode degradation is a common challenge during li extraction from salt lake brine or seawater while appropriate current voltage control has been shown to effectively avoid electrode deterioration as the result of h2 o2 generation or ion co insertion that occurs at a high applied potential most electrodes experience obvious performance deterioration after 100 or 200 cycles jahn teller distortion of the lattice structure and release of mn to solution has been the most concerning mechanism of lmo electrode degradation in li ion batteries and there is similar concern for lithium recovery systems because both they share the same electrochemical reaction with libs during repeated discharging and charging cycles the unwanted insertion of li into the empty 16c octahedral sites can result in serious structural distortion huang et al 2021 liu et al 2019c sun et al 1999 which leads to mn2 release as a result of the disproportion reaction shown in eq 7 fortunately a recent study using a battery like system with self made lmo electrodes showed mn dissolution could remain at 0 077 at the li intercalation stage much lower than the portion of mn lost from an ion sieve material 4 14 during li uptake xu et al 2021 the pourbaix diagram of the li mn h2o system showed that the main cause of mn loss from cathode was the transformation of limn2o4 to soluble mn2 at the late intercalation stage when the potential decreased from 1 04 v to 0 47 v however an understanding of the effect of jahn teller distortion in the lmo lattice during the lithium recovery and further decrease the mn dissolution during the operations is still needed in theory lfp electrode should be structurally stable but extensive degradation has been reported in previous studies on li ion batteries and likely occurs in the lithium recovery systems the presence of so called antisite defects in which iron ions occupy the li sites is possibly one of the factors that block li diffusion through the lattice and cause capacity loss pender et al 2020 8 2 m n 3 m n 4 m n 2 strategies for improvement of the stability of lmo lncm electrodes have for the most part involved three methods of i doping with other metals such as ti al co and ni and ii surface modification with other materials such as rgo ppy and al2o3 guan et al 2011 iii structure optimization such as construction of truncated octahedral limn2o4 xu et al 2018 zhou et al 2022 while these methods have been used to suppress manganese dissolution and jahn teller distortions zhao et al 2020a zhao et al 2020b the results of long term stability tests provided in these studies are not particularly convincing because the prepared electrodes were only operated over 30 50 cycles different from li ion batteries other factors can affect the long term stability of the electrode in electrosorption based lithium recovery systems the major difference of an electrosorption based lithium recovery system from a li ion battery is that the electrolyte should be natural brine not an optimized lithium containing organic electrolyte the natural brine has a low lithium concentration and contains a large amount of other ions which might block the li channel by irreversible adsorption or intercalation in addition the dissolved oxygen organic matter and microorganisms might cause fouling on the electrode or unwanted side reactions for the application of the lithium recovery system for li mining from real brine more efforts would be required to understand the effect of the environment and develop new electrosorption systems that exhibit both longer cycle life and high tolerance to real water conditions 4 2 perspectives on electrodialysis the major membrane types and manufacturers operating conditions and li extraction performance of ed based systems are summarized in table 3 the prospects for full scale application of ed based systems for li recovery from aqueous sources are favorable ascribed to the ease of scale up the good ion separation ability and high production efficiency recent studies have shown that coupling ed with other desalination technologies is able to provide very high grade li products jiang et al 2014 qiu et al 2019b torres et al 2020 however there is still plenty of room for improvement of ed applications especially with regard to li selectivity ion leakage membrane scaling and scale up and commercialization section 5 2 4 2 1 li selectivity of ed the li selective permeability of monovalent iems is the primary reason for the success of application of ed in li recovery although cations such as na and k can have a strong negative impact on the li mg separation efficiency of monovalent iems chen et al 2018 ji et al 2018 one approach to improve membrane properties and li permselectivity involves membrane surface modification by coating li selective adsorbent materials or grafting an ion imprinted polymer on the membrane surface bajestani et al 2020 limjuco et al 2017 liu et al 2020c sharma et al 2020 another approach involves the introduction of pre and or post treatment steps to remove competing monovalent ions which is typically achieved by chemicals addition ix or nf furthermore integrating different ed applications such as sed and bmed may create an optimum production protocol for recovery of li product and by products for instance the bmed system is often placed after the sed process to obtain li product and hcl h3bo3 one example is the two step production of lioh from high mg li ratio brine by integrating sed and bmed fig 7 a qiu et al 2019b h2c2o4 and ix was used to remove ca2 and mg2 after the first stage sed subsequently licl was concentrated by 30 fold in the 2nd stage sed and 99 purity lioh and hcl were produced in the bmed stage some researchers have developed membrane electrolysis me processes to initially remove na k and mg2 nieto et al 2019 nieto et al 2020 pan et al 2020 torres et al 2020 a particularly promising approach involves use of a three stage me process for production of pure na2co3 and li2co3 fig 7b nieto et al 2019 nieto et al 2020 the first stage removes mg2 and ca2 by increasing catholyte ph via the water reduction reaction in the second stage co2 is injected into the crystalizer to preferentially precipitate nahco3 7 ph 9 thereby further increasing the li na ratio in solution the final stage uses the same technique to precipitate li as li2co3 at a higher ph the final grade of na2co3 and li2co3 has been shown to reach 99 5 and 93 8 final li solution 1 9 g l 1 respectively another interesting hybrid process that integrates me with a li capture electrode material in a redox flow battery configuration has recently been described fig 7c yu et al 2020 in the first stage li in the seawater stream was inserted into the working lmo electrode with the oxygen evolution reaction occuring in cell 1 in the second stage under reversed potential the released li migrated to cell 2 and was recovered as lioh using oh generated from the oxygen reduction process the negative effects of low li concentration were effectively alleviated by the rapid flow of feed solution thereby providing a continuous flux of fresh li to the electrode the adsorption capacity of the prototype cell reached 20 6 mg g 1 li after 0 8 h operation 4 2 2 ion leakage and membrane scaling although sed has been shown to be effective in recovering li from brines with high li mg ratios the rejection ability of the membrane declines with increasing mg2 level of impurities present in the li recovery solution ji et al 2017 nie et al 2017a in this case particular challenges are associated with ion leakage and membrane fouling as a result of ca mg precipitation during long term use the leakage of oh from cathodic reaction and h from anodic reaction are found in the sed system resulting in the precipitation of mg oh 2 on the cathode membrane and ph decrease in the concentrate compartment respectively qiu et al 2019b proton leakage also influences the formation of boric acid in the bmed system and limits the current efficiency and regeneration of acid or base routine membrane cleaning or reverse polarity operation are likely to be necessary for effective long term operation of ed systems the development and use of novel membranes that reduce proton leakage by for instance the introduction of hydrophobic groups on the membrane surface or use of denser membranes with more extensive cross linkage may be a possibility but also need to consider the resultant the increase of membrane resistance zhang et al 2019b in particular the novel ed membranes for li recovery should provide better mechanical and chemical stability with these membranes able to tolerate high applied potential and wide ph range pärnamäe et al 2021 5 comparative summaries and future applications of electrochemical processes for li recovery 5 1 current status of electrochemical process for li recovery as should be apparent from the information presented so far the two electrochemical processes for li recovery share some similarities but also exhibit significant differences in many aspects one of the most important differences is that electrosorption processes capture li based on li selective electrodes while electrodialysis processes are based on membrane separation as such most of the studies reported in the literature describe advances in development of electrode materials or membrane types typically with additional information on approaches to optimizing their performance in various ways for example electrosorption studies typically focus on aspects such as electrode capacity electrode stability the effect of co existing ions on electrode performance and optimal working potential range of the electrode while electrodialysis studies focus on the effect of co existing ions on membrane separation performance the extent of ion leakage through the membrane and membrane stability in addition the advantages and drawbacks of electrosorption and electrodialysis processes are also compared from different perspectives and with regard to different attributes as shown in table 4 the concentration of li in the water resource of interest plays an important role in the choice of an appropriate li recovery strategy most of the previous electrochemical studies have focused on synthetic solutions of composition similar to li rich brines in south america and china in which li concentrations are often more than 20 mm palagonia et al 2017 as such we may conclude that a reasonable li concentration is required to enable sufficient energy efficiency if electrochemical systems are to be used for li capture for example for electrosorption systems excessively low li concentrations 5 mm typically result in poor mass transfer and large polarization effects leading to high energy consumption and low li adsorption capacity for electrodialysis systems low li concentrations will result in low limiting current density and strong competition effects with co existing ions e g na with these effects hindering efficient transport of li through the iem therefore other technologies such as ion sieve adsorption would appear to be a better option when mining resources such as seawater or geothermal waters containing relatively low concentrations of li encouragingly some companies have developed commercial ion exchange resins and successfully used these resins in pilot and full scale plants for direct li extraction from geothermal brines lithium south development corporation 2021 vulcan energy resources limited 2021 in addition the spent libs leachate solution often contains a high concentration of li making it economically attractive compared to the use of seawater with comparatively low li concentration nevertheless electrosorption based technologies may not be suitable for this type of li feed stream because the dissolution of li selective electrodes may necessitate the use of highly acidic leachate solution mg li ratio could be another important factor for the selection of li recovery strategies high mg li mass ratios 6 in li rich salt lake sources remain a particular challenge for all li recovery technologies with no process currently available that is capable of efficient separation of li from solutions containing a high concentration of mg to understand how electrochemical processes perform in high mg li ratio brines the data from some typical electrosorption lfp lmo and lncm electrodes and electrodialysis sed and lmed studies are shown in fig 8 although most electrosorption studies involved investigations for brines at 10 mg li ratio their sfs were much larger than 10 and some electrodes were even able to reach nearly 600 fig 8a by contrast most electrodialysis studies used mg li ratios in the range of 20 100 and obtained lower sf 10 30 than achieved by electrosorption this result indicates that current electrosorption processes can achieve moderate to excellent sf in low mg li ratio source waters while current electrodialysis systems are more efficient for waters with higher mg li ratios however electrodialysis systems exhibited higher electrical energy consumption per unit mole of li recovered than electrosorption systems due to the high voltages 5 35 v that were typically used fig 8b 5 2 future application of electrochemical li recovery technologies while most of the existing studies that have been undertaken have been at bench scale the possibility of future translation of these technologies to industrial scale application requires verification of the performance of these technologies in scaled up studies using actual brine in this section we discuss the technology readiness level trl of the various electrochemically based li recovery processes and describe key outcomes of significant scaled up studies that have been undertaken recently the trl describes the maturity level of a technology during the acquisition phase with the scale ranging from level 1 basic principle to 9 commercial industrial applications adopted here from zavahir et al 2020 as shown in fig 9 the majority of electrochemical studies that have been reported in the literature are identified as lab scale validation research and as such can be categorized to be in the trl range of 4 to 6 for electrosorption systems the majority of current studies trl 5 63 3 are associated with aspects regarding development of electrode materials reactor configuration and operational mode the studies describing performance of pilot scale electrosorption systems tr7 only account for 3 3 of those related to use of electrosorption for li recovery while a higher proportion 10 of the studies describing performance of ed systems for li recovery were at pilot scale compared to electrosorption ed is a more mature technology that is readily scaled up for recovery of li from aqueous sources containing different concentrations of li for example sed can both concentrate li from low and high strength source waters and generate the final li products e g li2co3 and lioh particularly when integrated with other technologies such as nanofiltration and reverse osmosis qiu et al 2019b in addition bmed as an important variant of conventional ed has been employed to produce acid and base with the process design tailored to the particular source water bunani et al 2017b however considering the high cost of ionic liquids and superionic conductors additional effort to optimize the scale up of lmed and sced is required if these processes are to become economically viable electrochemical reactors for li recovery have been developed at pilot scale using different configurations of stack design and include the ag lmo fig 10 a fp lfp and lmo nihcf systems he et al 2018 joo et al 2020b palagonia et al 2020 encouragingly an industrial scale battery like electrosorption system has been constructed and operated by central south lithium co ltd in golmud qinghai fig 10b central south lithium company limited 2021 this system can concentrate li up to 20 30 g l 1 at an estimated operating cost of 15 000 20 000 rmb per tonne of li2co3 production a cost that is comparable to that of the conventional evaporation method xu et al 2020b although industrialization of the electrosorption process has advanced significantly in recent years full scale application of this technology is still in its infancy the most concerning aspect of this approach to li recovery is related to whether the current electrode materials are sufficiently effective and stable especially for complex water sources with a high content of impurity ions it is anticipated that breakthroughs in the development of new generations of electrode systems and electrode materials will occur with these developments critical to advancement of this approach to li recovery from brines and other aqueous sources in addition it is likely that we will see the electrosorption concept combined with other techniques such as ed nanofiltration nf and ion exchange ix to improve li production and quality in the future li et al 2019 have provided a comprehensive review of membrane technologies of use in li recovery with particular attention given to commercial viability and ease of scale up the analysis presented in this review shows that lmed and sced exhibit high selectivity for li with low energy consumption but difficulties in material preparation and scale up prohibit their commercialization provision of membranes and supply of electricity account for the major costs of the sed process in addition the costs associated with routine cleaning and other ancillary processes should also be considered hybrid processes are recognized to be the most cost effective means of li recovery at scale in the near future it has been reported that large scale sed modules integrated with ro ix and bmed will be implemented for recovery of li from salt lakes in western china qinghai salt lake industry group company limited 2020 indeed a hybrid plant equipped with ed and nf was constructed in east taijinar salt lake in china in 2019 and now reportedly has an annual productivity of 10 000 tonnes li2co3 99 6 purity fig 10c qinghai institute of salt lakes chinese academy of sciences 2018 it is almost certain that we will see further development of such hybrid plants for li recovery from brines in future particular issues that should be taken into account before industrial implementation i e trl 7 of the processes described above are summarized as follows in theory even though ed utilizes multiple commercial iem pairs that are particularly expensive some electrosorption systems such as battery like or hybrid capacitive deionization configurations will require the extensive use of iems on scaling up to the industrial level therefore a cost breakdown for individual components e g iem cost electrode cost is particularly important for reasonable comparison of electrosorption and ed processes in future studies ed can rapidly concentrate li from low li concentration to a target level in a relatively short time 1 6 h but demands a cell voltage between 5 and 35 v causing high energy consumption that increases operational cost electrosorption system runs at a lower voltage 3 5 v but often require a longer duration 18 h for completion of the intercalation deintercalation cycle as such an energy consumption analysis is required to determine the most energy efficient process when considering a broad range of operational parameters although both electrosorption and ed can treat high mg li ratio brines electrosorption systems possess intrinsic advantages with regard to li selectivity because the most mature ed system sed bmed is not capable of separating monovalent ions na k from li given that the removal of na k requires long term evaporation with associated loss of li this evaporation process can likely be avoided in an electrosorption system with resultant savings in cost and avoidance of li wastage 6 conclusions li recovery by electrochemically based methods including electrosorption and electrodialysis have been described in this review the basic principles cell configurations operation modes and electrode materials of electrosorption systems have been described the selectivity and purity of electrosorption based processes can now be achieved a at very high level with low energy cost however the translation from lab scale to industrial scale still awaits more viable electrode systems beyond current materials to achieve the multiple goals necessary for cost effective operation under real water conditions including large li recovery capacity high recovery rate sufficient li selectivity stable cyclic performance and low energy consumption in comparison the application of electrodialysis is relatively mature and is already being implemented at full scale at present sed and bmsed can concentrate and produce high purity li together with other products when integrated with other techniques to eliminate negative impacts hybrid processes based around ed are capable of energy efficient li recovery from salt lake brines and are now cost competitive with conventional approaches further attention to enhancement of li selectivity of iems is likely to see even greater efficiencies of li recovery using ed based hybrid processes in future declaration of competing interest there

15711,driven by the electric vehicle revolution a sharp increase in lithium li demand as a result of the need to produce li ion batteries is expected in coming years to enable a sustainable li supply there is an urgent need to develop cost effective and environmentally friendly methods to extract li from a variety of sources including li rich salt lake brines seawater and wastewaters while the prevalent lime soda evaporation method is suitable for the mass extraction of li from brine sources with low mg li ratios it is time consuming 1 year and typically exhibits low li recovery electrochemically based methods have emerged as promising processes to recover li given their ease of management limited requirement for additional chemicals minimal waste production and high selectivity towards li this state of the art review provides a comprehensive overview of current advances in two key electrochemical li recovery technologies electrosorption and electrodialysis with particular attention given to advances in understanding of mechanism materials operational modes and system configurations we highlight the most pressing challenges these technologies encounter including i limited electrode capacity poor electrode stability and co insertion of impurity cations in the electrosorption process and ii limited li selectivity of available ion exchange membranes

sf technology readiness level trl united states geological survey usgs 1 introduction lithium li as the lightest metal on earth holds an increasingly important position in numerous fields in the 21st century the remarkable properties of li facilitate its use in products such as batteries glasses ceramics greases chemical reagents pharmaceuticals and nuclear fuels attention on li was heightened by the discovery in 1913 of its energy storage properties lewis and keyes 1913 the past thirty years has witnessed continuous growth in global li demand as a result particularly of the dramatic increase in production of li ion batteries libs blomgren 2016 which are widely used for powering electric vehicles and in grid storage applications over the last 5 years the proportion of li consumed for battery production has risen from 35 to 65 with the amount required for this application now on the order of 35 000 tonnes per annum u s geological survey 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 if the current annual growth rate of 32 is maintained it is predicted that the amount required will reach 174 000 tonnes in 2025 with demand expected to outstrip production by early 2022 choubey et al 2016 tabelin et al 2021 as li plays a more important and potentially irreplaceable role in sustainable energy development exploitation of li resources in a cost effective and sustainable manner is of particular urgency the united states geological survey usgs reports that there are about 86 million tonnes of identified reserves of total natural li resources worldwide with li distributed in diverse natural environments including mineral deposits 40 and water bodies 60 kavanagh et al 2018 there were about 82 000 tonnes of lithium produced in 2021 with more than 90 of the li in the global market supplied by australia chile argentina and china murodjon et al 2020 tabelin et al 2021 u s geological survey 2020 compared to mineral lithium resources especially in the forms of pegmatite cookeite taeniolite and lithiophorite exploitation of li rich brine sources is considered to be a promising approach in view of the relatively lower environmental impact swain 2017 tabelin et al 2021 the total lithium content in natural water bodies e g salt lake brines and seawater is much larger than that present in li ore bodies and recovery of li from aqueous sources is easier than mining of mineral resources particularly those dominated by low li content minerals these facts suggest that one important way to address the potential li shortage is to develop cost effective technologies for li extraction from li rich aqueous solutions tabelin et al 2021 as such this review will focus on li extraction technologies from waters such as salt lake brines geothermal waters and seawater in view of the relative abundance of li in these water types solar evaporation with subsequent precipitation in purpose built ponds is widely used for commercial li production from li rich salt lakes in chile and argentina swain 2017 the process involves solar evaporation concentration chemical precipitation purification and carbonation an et al 2012 while this process is suitable for the mass li extraction from brine sources it is time consuming 1 year evaporation with a low recovery efficiency in addition the chemical composition of salt lakes at different geographical locations is highly variable table 1 li 0 1 3 6 mg 3 5 12 1 na 39 3 92 1 conventional methods are not applicable to lake brines with high mg li ratio 6 because more precipitant will be consumed to remove mg leading to the production of substantial quantities of residual waste lee et al 2013 zhao et al 2013b in such cases alternative technologies have been proposed to enhance li separation purification and recovery including liquid liquid extraction zhou et al 2011 use of ion exchange resins bukowsky et al 1991 nishihama et al 2011 ion sieve adsorption ooi et al 1986 and nanofiltration wen et al 2006 unfortunately each of these technologies suffers from its own intrinsic limitations for instance membrane technologies such as nanofiltration involve high energy consumption large capital cost and the possibility of severe membrane fouling ion sieve adsorption materials often exhibit poor permeability and high dissolution rates in acid but more viable products have recently been developed and are being successfully trialled at pilot scale lithium south development corporation 2021 liu et al 2019b vulcan energy resources limited 2021 xu et al 2020a in view of these limitations particular attention over the last 30 years has been given to the possible use of electrochemical techniques for li recovery with research into areas such as electrosorption and electrodialysis leading to a series of breakthroughs including synthesis of novel electrode materials and membranes and innovation with regard to configuration and operational mode as evidence of this growing interest the number of publication in this field has increased to over 130 since 2010 taking advantage of the electric field only the minority constituents i e charged ions of the brine can be selectively removed in an electrochemical system whereas conventional solar evaporation or membrane separation removes or rejects the majority constituent i e water with heat sources or pressure pumps as such electrochemically based technologies might be expected to exhibit particular benefits with respect to ease of management minimal waste production and more importantly high selectivity and recovery towards li particular attention in recent years has been given to the use of electrochemical technologies for recovery of a portion of the 230 billion tonnes of li present in seawater arroyo et al 2019 chitrakar et al 2001 guo et al 2018 hong et al 2018 hoshino 2013 2015 joo et al 2020b kim et al 2015a ryu et al 2019 um and hirato 2014 yang et al 2018 however compared to the high li content of salt lake brines 0 2 1 6 g l 1 the concentration of li in seawater is extremely low at 0 17 mg l 1 resulting in much higher production costs kavanagh et al 2018 herein we critically review recent advances in two electrochemically based li recovery technologies electrosorption and electrodialysis in section 2 we introduce fundamental details of electrosorption including its principles cell architecture and electrode materials battistel et al 2020 calvo 2019 liu et al 2019b zhao et al 2019b in section 3 we summarize the principles membrane types and operational modes of electrodialysis we then highlight the most pressing restrictions and challenges these technologies encounter in practical application and introduce potential strategies to resolve these challenges finally we conclude this review by providing some perspectives on likely future developments particularly regarding the translation of bench scale studies to pilot full scale trials and finally to industrial applications 2 li recovery by electrosorption based processes 2 1 principle of electrosorption in this review we employ the term electrosorption to refer to the process whereby charged ions in bulk phase are retained by solid phase electrodes by an electrostatic force this process is also referred to as electrochemical ion pumping in some studies palagonia et al 2017 siekierka et al 2018a trocoli et al 2016 trócoli et al 2017 in an electrosorption system ions can be captured through either faradaic processes or non faradaic processes non faradaic processes involve the storage of ions in the electric double layers edl at the interface between the electrodes and electrolyte however capacitive electrodes made from materials such as porous carbon do not possess specific selectivity to li ions unless the material is modified or selective ion exchange membranes iem are present therefore non faradaic processes are often applied in water desalination where ion selectivity is not required with capacitive porous carbon electrodes used for reversible anion adsorption and desorption kim et al 2015b shang et al 2021 siekierka et al 2018a zhao et al 2020c the key point of faradaic processes is that there is transfer of ionic or electronic charge across the electrical double layer at the interface between the electrode and contacting solid or liquid electrolyte that serves as an electron reservoir with these phases accepting or donating electrons application of a faradaic process for recovery of li was first reported by kanoh et al 1991 and involved the use of a λ mno2 pt electrode system however the system exhibited high energy cost and large ph fluctuation subsequently a wide variety of cathode and anode materials have been proposed for li recovery with systems using these electrode materials enabling ion uptake by one of four possible uptake mechanisms fig 1 i ion uptake by insertion and ii conversion reactions iii ion binding with electroactive polymer and iv ion removal by charge compensation of redox active electrolytes srimuk et al 2020 2 1 1 ion insertion reactions ion insertion or intercalation is at the core of selective li capture via electrosorption based systems fig 1a to achieve this a li precursor is firstly synthesized by introducing li into metal oxide compounds li is then removed from the lattice structure of the prepared li precursor by electrochemical treatment or acid treatment for a definite time creating vacant sites in the crystal skeleton that can subsequently be used to re capture li the small size of the vacant sites restricts non li cation insertion into these sites correspondingly for the electrochemical treatment the electronic charge is transferred to the circuit oxidizing the transition metal in the electrode for acid treatment the electrodes undergo redox reaction and ion exchange with h resulting in delithiation and an increase in the oxidation state of the transition metals by far the most widely reported li selective electrodes are those involving lifepo4 lfp and limn2o4 lmo ternary lithium materials and hybrid metal polymer materials du et al 2016a lawagon et al 2018 lee et al 2013 trócoli et al 2014 the prussian blue anode nickel hexacyanoferrate nihcf could also serve as an alternative to the expensive ag counter electrode that has been extensively used in previous studies this type of faradaic electrode preferentially intercalates na k but has low affinity to li palagonia et al 2017 2019 2020 trócoli et al 2015 trocoli et al 2016 trócoli et al 2017 xie et al 2020 when li is captured by li selective electrode na k is released from nihcf to solution for electro neutrality 2 1 2 conversion reactions metallic electrodes when used as the counter electrode undergo phase conversion from the metallic state to a new phase in order to maintain charge balance for instance accompanied with the li capture ag agcl bi biocl conversion reactions occur resulting in removal of cl from solution fig 1b kim et al 2018 lee et al 2013 trócoli et al 2014 zhao et al 2021 and zn zn2 reaction occurs for maintaining the charge balance kim et al 2018 in addition lithium metallic electrodes have been used to recover metallic lithium from electrolyte directly via reduction of li to li metal bae et al 2016 yang et al 2018 2 1 3 surface redox reactions electroactive polymers such as the conducting polymers polyaniline pani and polypyrrole ppy can be used as materials for counter electrode to capture and release anions such as cl fig 1c charge injection withdrawal strongly affects the reduction oxidation state of electroactive polymers for example the ppy modified electrode undergoes redox reaction ppy ncl ne ppyn ncl with reversible uptake release of cl in the li extraction process missoni et al 2016 zhao et al 2019a however cation exchange can also take place on electrodes on which ppy is combined with large counterions such as polystyrene sulfonate pssn for example the ppy pss composite was incorporated on the surface of an λ mno2 electrode in order to enhance li ion exchange rate with the λ mno2 electrode found to selectively capture li du et al 2016a 2 1 4 electrolyte redox reactions reversible redox couples present in the electrolyte solution can serve as the counter electrode to facilitate redox reactions involved in li capture e g engagement of the i i3 redox couple as a liquid electrode to balance charge transfer fig 1d kim et al 2015a moreover charge compensation can also be applied when the redox couple such as fe cn 6 3 fe cn 6 4 is not directly involved with li capture discharge but can be used to accept or donate electrons at the electrolyte electrode interface kim et al 2021 kim et al 2020a this mechanism enables fast electron transfer and provides greater charge storage 2 2 architectures and operation of the electrosorption systems four types of cell architecture are usually used for li electroadsorption in a flow by cell one of the most prevalent designs of electrochemical cells two parallel flat plate electrodes are vertically immersed into li containing brine and connected with a power supply fig 2 a the flow by electrosorption system typically follows a four step operation fig 2e i application of a potential difference between the li capture electrode and the counter electrode to selectively extract li from the feed stream ii flushing of the cell electrode with distilled water iii reversal of electrode polarity to release li into the recovery solution iv flushing of the spacer chamber with distilled water to completely remove the residual li adsorption in flow by systems is diffusion limited due to the presence of a thick boundary layer 100 μm and limited accessibility of the active sites within the electrodes donaghue and chaplin 2013 palagonia et al 2017 in contrast the use of a flow through cell where the water passes through a porous electrode greatly enhances the ion adsorption efficiency fig 2b palagonia et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a this enhancement can be attributed to the convective transport of water through the pores of the electrodes which results in a decrease in the diffusional boundary layer thickness to a scale comparable to the pore radius and leads to the full use of the active sites of the electrodes use of an anode separator cathode sandwich assembly in flow through configuration is expected to further reduce the internal resistance as no water channel is required between the two electrodes marchini et al 2018 mu et al 2021 romero et al 2021 romero et al 2020 a rocking chair design based on the concept of the classical rocking chair like libs has also been proposed for li recovery systems guo et al 2020 han et al 2020 joo et al 2020a liu et al 2019a xu et al 2021 zhao et al 2017 zhao et al 2013b a rocking chair cell is composed of two symmetrical li capture electrodes separated by an anion exchange membrane aem this system accomplishes capture release of li within each half cell concurrently without extra electrode regeneration step fig 2c and f to overcome the discontinuity and enhance the adsorption capacity of the conventional electrosorption systems novel fluidic electrochemical configurations inspired by redox flow batteries and supercapacitors have been proposed in these systems flowable particles were used as the li adsorption electrodes instead of static electrodes fig 2d kim et al 2021 kim et al 2020a yu et al 2020 redox couples can be added to the electrolyte to enhance electron transfer between the particle electrodes the most distinctive benefit of flow electrode systems is the ease of management e g regeneration and or replacement of the electrodes and the possibility to achieve continuous operation although the selectivity towards li capture needs further improvement ha et al 2019 kim et al 2021 2 3 electrode materials electrodes are at the heart of an electrochemical li adsorption system in the past two decades a number of li electroadsorption electrodes have been developed in this section we will provide a brief introduction of these electrodes 2 3 1 lfp electrodes lithium iron phosphate lifepo4 lfp also classified as a polyanionic material was first synthesized in 1996 padhi et al 1997 in the lattice structure of lfp li and fe are located at octahedral 4a and 4c sites respectively while p occupies the tetrahedral 4c site yuan et al 2011 the lio6 and feo6 sheets are arrayed in parallel and are linked together with po4 as shown in fig 3 a the intercalation of li results in a reduction of fe iii centres to fe ii and a change in phase with the reaction expressed as 1 l i 1 x fe 1 x ii fe x iii p o 4 xl i x e lif e ii p o 4 where the stoichiometric coefficient x is between 0 and 1 fepo4 fp and lifepo4 phases may coexist in the lfp structure until the material has been fully de lithiated in a typical cyclic voltammetry cv curve of the lfp electrode fig 3b only one cathodic and one anodic peak appear corresponding to the li intercalation and deintercalation processes accompanying the fe2 fe3 redox transformation examination of li diffusion coefficients during this transformation reveal that lithiation is more difficult than delithiation zhao et al 2013b lfp is noted for its good stability and reversibility long cycle life low cost and environmentally benign nature however lfp possesses intrinsically poor ionic diffusion and electronic conductivity due to its 1d channel structure amin et al 2006 surface coating and structure modifications are plausible approaches to overcome these limitations han et al 2020 kim et al 2015a sun et al 2020 kim et al 2015a proposed that lfp could be modified via carbon coating and hydrophilic polydopamine pd coating to improve its electrical conductivity and wettability thereby increasing the ion concentration and mobility around the electrode fig 3c and providing more energy for li to overcome the energy barrier of insertion another interesting possibility is to create abundant pores 5 20 μm by modifying the lfp electrode with polyethylene glycol fig 3d and e thereby creating additional channels for the water to pass through and facilitate li transport and adsorption fig 3f sun et al 2020 such a honeycomb like structure was shown to enhance the li uptake capacity by 57 and reached the adsorption equilibrium within 1 5 h another noteworthy drawback of lfp electrodes is the co insertion of impurity ions pasta et al 2012 investigated the effects of li na ratios from 1 100 to 1 10 000 and found that li capture was diffusion controlled by the li concentration in brine while higher potential led to fast li intercalation rapid li depletion around the electrode occurred resulting in the capture of secondary ions later studies showed that the preferential co insertion order of the lfp electrode was li na k mg2 he et al 2018 liu et al 2015 liu et al 2014 zhao et al 2013a zhao et al 2013b he et al 2018 reported that a lower range of operating voltage 1 1v of the lfp electrode was found to be optimal in avoiding h2 o2 generation rapid li depletion and ion co insertion the system could successfully reduce the ratio of mg li from 60 to 0 45 but long operation times 600 min per cycle in this study were required as a result of the low ion removal rate at the preferred lower operating potentials he et al 2018 in addition a 16 capacity loss was still observed for the lfp electrode after 50 cycles of continuous operation 2 3 2 lmo electrodes spinel type lithium manganese oxide material limn2o4 lmo belongs to the cubic crystal structure with space group fd3m thirty two oxygen atoms reside at the 32e sites of each unit cell and form a face centered cubic close packing fccp structure eight li atoms are located at the tetrahedral 8a sites and 16 mn atoms at octahedral 16d sites fig 4 a missoni et al 2016 the inner structure of the material is characterized by 3d channels that enable li to diffuse through the material kanoh et al 1995 the peaks in the cv fig 4b indicate two transition states at each anodic and cathodic half curve which can be described by the following reactions 2 2 λ m n iv o 2 05 l i 0 5 e l i 0 5 m n iii m n iv o 4 3 l i 0 5 m n iii m n iv o 4 0 5 l i 0 5 e limn 2 iii o 4 where peak pairs a2 a1 and c2 c1 correspond to li insertion and release shown in eq 2 and eq 3 respectively by combining eqs 2 and 3 the complete lithiation process can be expressed as 4 l i 1 x mn 1 x iii m n iv o 4 xl i x e lim n iii m n iv o 4 where the value of the stoichiometric coefficient x is between 0 and 1 compared to the lfp electrode lmo electrode is found to have faster li ion transport rate higher li adsorption capacity selectivity more stable structure and no obvious na mg co intercalation nevertheless lmo electrodes still suffer from obvious performance deterioration during prolonged operation for example the capacity of lmo zn system reduced to 73 after 100 cycles of operation kim et al 2018 xu et al 2018 later studies attempted to improve structure stability of the lmo electrode in multiple ways with respect to material modifications for example by employing λ mno2 nanoparticles fig 4c trócoli et al 2017 or 1d λ mno2 nanorods fig 4d xie et al 2020 both li uptake capacity and electrode recyclability can be greatly improved as a result of the accelerated rate of electron transfer and larger surface to volume ratio lmo electrode surface can also be coated with the protective layer such as ppy al2o3 or zro2 film to stabilize its structure while increasing li ion mobility on the surface fang et al 2022 guan et al 2011 luo et al 2022 zhao et al 2020b in addition a 3d porous structure lmo film consisting of lmo nanorods rgo nanosheets and ca alginate hydrogel was found to have high electrode stability 98 3 capacity after 100 cycles and superior li recovery capacity 32 7 mg g 1 fig 4e zhang et al 2021 the novel composite film can provide abundant 3d channels for fast li diffusion rate and the use of ca alginate can avoid restacking and aggregation of rgo sheets and improve the stability of lmo nanorods 2 3 3 lncm electrodes lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide lncm another promising cathode candidate has been reported to have higher theoretical li uptake capacity 71 95 mg g 1 and extraordinary charge discharge property than normal lmo and lfp electrode shang et al 2021 during the charge discharge processes only ni2 and co3 are electrochemically active whereas mn4 plays an important role in the stability of the crystal structure li et al 2013 while ni co and mn leakage from the lncm electrodes to the receiving solution was extremely low physical loss of electrode materials during electrode placement and solution transfer still occur leading to a gradual increase in energy consumption from 1 55 to 4 99 wh mol 1 li and cycling degradation during prolonged operation lawagon et al 2018 to address this issue rgo gauze was used to wrap the lini0 6co0 2mn0 2o2 by co precipitation and hydrothermal reduction forming a novel core shell structured microsphere fig 4f zhao et al 2020a the graphene gauze provided protection for the lncm electrode and effectively mitigated the transformation of the electrode from a layer structure to a spinel structure and avoided the probability of lncm lattice collapse after long term operation the effect of rgo coating became more pronounce when the discharge rate increased from 0 2 c to 10 c the capacity of rgo lncm electrode reduced to 81 4 for 30 cycles at the discharging rate of 10 c but the bare lncm electrode only remained 70 capacity 2 3 4 hybrid metal polymer electrode although the ion sieving materials introduced above have specific selectivity towards li they usually suffer from poor conductivity and low stability modification of the electrodes by electroactive polymers can help address these issues du et al 2016b srimuk et al 2020 fang et al 2022 and wang et al 2019a measured the li diffusion rate of the modifed electrode and proved that ppy coating enhanced li diffusion coefficient of λ mno2 electrode due to faster electron transfer rate of the electroactive materials du et al 2016a imprinted the pss ppy copolymer as a conductive cross linking agent on the core shell structure of λ mno2 to improve electron transfer and cation exchange though selective li capture was primarily achieved by λ mno2 fig 4g to i this electrode exhibited extremely high ion exchange capacity ideal selectivity and rapid equilibrium time i e 2 h 3 li recovery by electrodialysis based processes electrodialysis ed is an electrochemical membrane separation technology that has been widely used in brackish water desalination water softening and wastewater treatment ed has been recognized as an easily scaled up technology in recovery of li from a broad range of sources such as salt lake seawater brine geothermal water leaching solution of ore concentrate and spent li ion battery leachate gmar and chagnes 2019 swain 2017 conventional ed is fabricated by inserting multiple pairs of aem and cem alternately between one pair of anode and cathode thus forming multiple concentrate desalting chambers under the driving force of an electric field cations and anions in solution are transported through oppositely charged ion exchange membranes iems but rejected by the same charge iems leading to ion accumulation in the concentrate chambers and depletion in the dilute chambers respectively in this section we will introduce four types of electrodialysis system for lithium separation including selective electrodialysis sed liquid membrane electrodialysis lmed bipolar membrane electrodialysis bmed and superionic conductor electrodialysis sced 3 1 electrodialysis with selective iem to enable efficient li separation from high mg li ratio brine monovalent selective iems are normally utilized to replace the standard iems in ed systems fig 5 a standard iems have no selectivity towards mono or divalent ions in contrast special grade iems are selective to monovalent ions over divalent ions rijnaarts et al 2019 monovalent selective iems function with the assistance of i charge rejection where a thin oppositely charged layer is used to hinder the permeation of divalent cations zhao et al 2016 and ii a crosslinked layer through which transport of divalent ions with their larger hydrated ion size is hindered sata 2007 with these particular iems ed has been shown to be technically and potentially economically feasible in achieving li separation from multinary mixtures with high mg li ratio nie et al 2017b also reported that li separation using sed was technically and economically feasible with the mg li mass ratio decreasing from 150 to 10 and a li recovery efficiency of 95 3 achieved under optimal operating conditions nie et al 2017a note that a small fraction of free hydrated mg will convert to mgcl with larger radius and less charge density resulting in less mg leakage it should be noted however that other monovalent cations e g k and na will compete more strongly than mg2 and ca2 with li with respect to migration through the monovalent selective cem chen et al 2018 high levels of coexisting ions could lead to low current efficiency excessive energy consumption and low li recovery efficiency nevertheless higher concentration of anions such as so4 2 and hco3 can beneficially immobilize mg migration by forming mgso4 and mg hco3 chen et al 2018 ji et al 2018 3 2 electrodialysis with bipolar membrane in addition to monovalent iems novel bipolar membranes bpm can also be incorporated into electrodialysis systems for li recovery in what is known as bipolar membrane electrodialysis bmed fig 5b the bpm has a sandwich like structure and is composed of an aem a cem and an intermediate hydrophilic layer in which water molecules dissociate to h and oh with the aid of bpm the electrodialyzer can be designed for the dual purposes of li separation and acid e g h3bo3 and hcl alkali e g lioh production afifah et al 2018 iizuka et al 2013 the first application of bipolar membranes in an ed system was in the production of lioh and multiple types of acids hwang et al 2016 jiang et al 2014 firstly the brine was pre concentrated via a conventional ed process and na2co3 was added to the concentrated stream to produce a li2co3 solution this li2co3 solution was then pumped to the bmed cell where lioh was produced jiang et al 2014 the author estimated that only 8 kwh was required to produce one kilogram of lioh when 0 18 m feed concentration of li2co3 solution was used with an applied current density of 30 ma cm 2 another application for bmed is to produce lioh and h3bo3 from geothermal water during the operation boron is first converted to charged b oh 4 due to the in situ generated alkali which can migrate through the aem and form neutral h3bo3 in the acid compartment under an optimal voltage of 30 v bmed could recover 50 b and 62 li with the separation efficiencies reaching 86 9 and 94 7 i̇pekçi et al 2018 a recent study showed that bmed could be used to convert low value li3po4 into high value lioh products while recycling h3po4 wei et al 2022 the solvent h3po4 was firstly used to dissolve solid li3po4 in the salt chamber and the generated li and po4 3 then formed lioh and h3po4 in the neighboring base and acid chambers respectively with passage through the aem and cem the highest li recovery was 99 and the energy consumption was 12 989 kwh kg 1 lioh at a current density of 40 ma cm 2 however due to the existence of large diameter ion channels and poor adhesion of aem and cem layers unwanted co ion leakage or back diffusion through the bpm resulted in a lower purity of product for example at high acid concentration salt anions e g cl from the acid compartment could transport through the bpm and contaminate the produced base lioh and vice versa wilhelm et al 2001 additionally back diffusion of b oh 4 and li ions from the acid base chamber to the salt chamber could occur at high applied potential i̇pekçi et al 2018 in addition the commercial bpm typically has higher resistance and membrane cost than monopolar membranes making it more energy consuming and less economically attractive blommaert et al 2021 pärnamäe et al 2021 3 3 electrodialysis with liquid membrane in addition to conventional solid phase membranes liquid membranes lm have been developed for li selective separation on the basis of liquid liquid extraction in a technology known as liquid membrane electrodialysis lmed fig 5c liu et al 2020b zhao et al 2019c the sandwiched lm is composed of two cems and a li loaded liquid film tributyl phosphate tbp and clo4 composite has been shown to be an effective organic liquid film with the mg li ratio reduced from 100 to 2 and other impurity cations e g na k mg2 and ca2 being effectively separated zhao et al 2019c other lm such as pp13 tfsi n methyl n propylpiperidium bis trifluoromethane sulfonyl imide has also been shown to exhibit high li affinity and good resistance to other coexisting cations with less than 1 na and mg leakage hoshino 2013 while ionic liquids possess excellent properties such as thermal stability high li selectivity and low volatilization solvent leakage and membrane swelling could occur and affect separation efficiency after long term operation li et al 2019 in addition high toxicity of ionic liquids can have negative impacts on the environment and high production cost is another obstacle hampering their extensive use 3 4 electrodialysis with superconductor membrane an ionic superconductor membrane was first reported by fig 5d hoshino 2013 2015 subsequently a solar powered electrodialysis prototype incorporated with ionic superconductor li1 xalyge2 y po4 3 nasicon was designed to continuously extract li from seawater yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 li was transported from seawater 0 1 0 2 mg l 1 li through the solid membrane to the cathode where li was reduced to metallic li after 1 h operation under a current density of 240 μa cm 2 the rate of li production of the cell was around 5 7 mg dm 2 h 1 a more recent study has demonstrated that a dense glass type li0 33la0 56tio3 llto material is able to enrich li in red sea water from 0 21 mg l 1 to 9000 mg l 1 after 5 stage concentration 100 h the membrane showed an exceedingly high li mg selectivity of 6090 and good stability after 2000 h operation the purity of the final recovered li3po4 product was 99 li et al 2021 however the high cost of solid superionic conductor may restrict the practical application of this technology 4 current challenges and strategies of electrochemical processes on li recovery 4 1 perspectives on electrosorption based processes a summary of the li capture performance of various electrosorpotion systems is provided in table 2 although the past decade has witnessed great advances in electrosorption based technologies for li recovery many challenges still exist in this section we will first introduce the most urgent issues regarding electrosorpotion systems including capacity limitation li selectivity counter electrode selection long term stability of the system and feasibility of scale up section 5 2 subsequently possible strategies to overcome these hurdles will be discussed 4 1 1 capacity limitation of electrodes as shown in fig 6 a li adsorption capacity has increased by 3 5 times over the last three decades as a result of ongoing breakthroughs in electrode development for example the li capture rate of the lncm electrode can reach as high as 70 mg g 1 h 1 with a li adsorption capacity of 35 mg g 1 nearly an order of magnitude higher than those of the normal lfp and lmo electrodes fig 6b while these achievements are impressive they are still far from satisfactory for real implementation a common strategy to further increase electrode adsorption capacity and charge transfer is to optimize the electrode preparation these optimization methods include ball milling kim et al 2020b pore forming liu et al 2021 sun et al 2020 nanosizing trócoli et al 2017 xie et al 2020 element doping lawagon et al 2018 siekierka et al 2018b zhao et al 2020c and coating with organic or inorganic materials fang et al 2022 luo et al 2022 wang et al 2019b zhang et al 2021 zhao et al 2020a zhao et al 2020b note that while the performance of the electrodes can be enhanced through these optimization processes the costs of electrode production are anticipated to increase accordingly choosing an appropriate voltage current range in the discharging and charging steps can enhance the actual charge capacity of the li capture electrode narrowing of the potential window can avoid h2 o2 generation and increase electrode stability if the applied current is too high rapid li depletion near the electrode surface results in poor mass transfer from the electrolyte which leads to lower li adsorption capacity and possibly co insertion of other ions such as mg2 one strategy is for the discharging step appropriate increase in the current could accelerate electrode desorption without imparting obvious negative impacts on electrode capacity trócoli et al 2017 the electrical potential in the charging step can be maintained at a low level to avoid rapid li depletion but at the expense of slow li recovery rate liu et al 2015 for example kim et al 2019 confirmed that a strategy that uses consecutive multi stage operation combined with staged current control 10 μa cm 2 in adsorption step and 0 2 ma cm 2 in desorption was optimal for treating seawater concentrate 0 34 mg l 1 li furthermore there is typically a trade off between the operational condition e g applied current and initial li concentration and system response e g li adsorption capacity and recovery rate this trade off has been demonstrated in studies by kim et al 2020b who showed that current density and li concentration are two important limiting factors determining the utilization percentage of λ mno2 which in turn directly controls the usable li capacity of the electrode fig 6c and d based on these insights we postulate that relatively high current density can be used in high li concentration source waters resulting in rapid li recovery for example for common li concentration 20 50 mm in salt lake brine the li adsorption capacity of the lmo electrode is more than 20 mg g 1 at a current density of 100 ma g 1 whereas it would reduce to only 4 mg g 1 in 5 mm li brine under the same conditions kim et al 2020b in addition the recovery rate the ratio between the amount of recovered li and the amount of li included in the brine needs to be considered for practical use of an electrosorption based lithium recovery system although many studies have witnessed high selectivity of the system to lithium few studies have focused on improving the recovery rate as the amount of brine is limited the recovery rate would be closely related to the amount of li we can extract from the brine therefore improvement in the li capacity of the electrode and efficient reactor design need to be considered to increase the recovery rate of the system however after recovering a certain amount of lithium the lithium recovery rate must be lowered by reducing the applied current density in view of the reduction in mass transfer that is induced by the decrease in lithium concentration also more energy would be consumed for the process because of the increase in resistance therefore it would be necessary to optimize the recovery rate to recover lithium with the highest efficiency and economic feasibility considering that the final lithium products should ideally be solid li2co3 or lioh additional processes e g evaporation precipitation and crystallization are required after the electrosorption process therefore obtaining the recovery solution with a high li concentration is of great importance to improving the overall recovery rate and reducing operating costs along with developing high capacity electrodes and optimizing operating modes proper reactor design is critical for example using a flow electrode system could be beneficial from this standpoint because it can maximize the electrode to liquid ratio ha et al 2019 kim et al 2021 4 1 2 li selectivity of the electrodes one of the greatest strengths of the electrosorption system is that the li capture electrode has high preferential affinity towards li over other competitive ions including na k mg2 and ca2 it is commonly claimed in the literature that co intercalation of impurity ions into the lmo electrode is limited nevertheless we note in some studies that a small fraction of the impurity ions does leak into the recovery solution kim et al 2019 lee et al 2013 siekierka et al 2018b zhao et al 2019a zhao et al 2017 one reason for this leakage could be that competing cations co adsorb on the electrode and then desorb into the recovery solution marchini et al 2016 indeed previous publications do report the co intercalation of impurity ions in the lfp electrode causing irreversible capacity loss for li capture he et al 2018 kim et al 2015a pasta et al 2012 another possibility is that the cell rinse to remove residual ions after the charging process was inadequate with these ions subsequently being introduced to the concentrate stream during the discharging process although li capture electrodes are effective for mining li rich lake brine the problem of na interference remains a challenge to li extraction from seawater where the li na molar ratio is on the order of 5 10 5 a pulsed lithiation operational mode has been proposed as one means of improving li na selectivity of lfp from seawater mining liu et al 2020a due to different diffusion rates of li and na the addition of the rest period enabled li and na to redistribute within the electrode thus improving electrode homogeneity and reducing intercalation overpotential fig 6e the reverse pulsed period facilitated release of more na and li these measures created a uniform concentration front in the vicinity of the electrode which alleviated li depletion reduced concentration polarization and resulted in an enhancement in li na selectivity from 1 2 to 1 1 fig 6f one issue that hinders the effective comparison of li selectivity of different electrodes is the use of different selectivity performance metrics as shown in table 2 one commonly reported metric in previous studies is the ratio of concentration of li and that of another cation m in the recovery solution 5 k l i m c l i r c m s a distribution coefficient can be defined for each component as the ratio of its concentration in the recovery solution to that in the source solution i e for li and another ion m we have 6 k l i c l i r c l i s k m c m r c m s for systems in which thermodynamic equilibrium is established between the two phases these quantities would just be the partition coefficients for the different ions no such attribution can be given here because the relative concentrations depend on a number of different processing conditions and the recovery and source solutions are not in thermodynamic equilibrium nonetheless we can define a separation factor sf to provide a metric for the overall effectiveness of the li enrichment process 7 s f k l i k m c l i c m r c l i c m s as shown this quantity can also be expressed as the ratio of the relative concentrations of the li and the contaminating ion m in the recovery solution to their relative concentrations in the source solution thanks to the extremely high intrinsic selectivity to li of the electrodes the magnitude of sf in the electrosorption based li recovery system is determined principally by the initial composition of the brine and not by the electrode performance therefore sf could vary from 1 to a few thousand table 2 even using the same li capturing electrode which makes it hard to compare effective sf values between different systems on the other hand k li m shows the quality of the final recovery solution which is likely to be a critical determinant of the purity of the final lithium products however the particular types of ions that are present in the recovery solution will differ depending on the composition of the initial brine therefore the li purity p li defined as the percentage of li in the final recovery solution provides a more intuitive measure of recovery performance we recommend in the future that investigators include p li in their evaluation of performance and that the applied conditions and initial li concentration also always be provided 4 1 3 significance of counter electrodes the use of an appropriate counter electrode is of equal significance to li recovery performance and the overall cost as the li capturing electrode the conventional battery system generally consists of a li capturing electrode e g lfp and a cl capturing counter electrode with materials such as ag used for anion capture in small scale studies the high cost and the low stability of ag limit the use of this material in full scale reactors with considerable effort invested in finding cost effective alternatives for example trocoli et al 2016 substituted it with a low cost and environmentally friendly nihcf electrode as a li exclusion and na k capturing electrode as mentioned in section 2 1 2 this innovative system showed similar energy consumption as that observed in the ag system more importantly the impurities that might be introduced during the operation can be removed further increasing the purity of li however the initial concentration of na k in the recovery solution should be carefully selected to obtain the li solution in high purity polymeric materials such as pani and ppy have been widely used as counter electrodes in li recovery systems and shown to be effective in capturing cl though their stability over long term operation is questionable for example the charge capacity of pani showed a 40 degradation after 100 cycles zhao et al 2019a and ppy material has been reported to exhibit similar degradation problems though further evaluation is required missoni et al 2016 in addition the interaction of these materials with other anions such as so4 2 is unclear trócoli 2021 for practical applications careful comparison between the performance of different counter electrodes is necessary with an overall evaluation regarding key performance metrics such as capacity stability and economic feasibility required also the development of new types of counter electrodes should be encouraged with particular attention given to the feasibility of use at large scale and over extended periods of operation 4 1 4 long term stability electrode degradation is a common challenge during li extraction from salt lake brine or seawater while appropriate current voltage control has been shown to effectively avoid electrode deterioration as the result of h2 o2 generation or ion co insertion that occurs at a high applied potential most electrodes experience obvious performance deterioration after 100 or 200 cycles jahn teller distortion of the lattice structure and release of mn to solution has been the most concerning mechanism of lmo electrode degradation in li ion batteries and there is similar concern for lithium recovery systems because both they share the same electrochemical reaction with libs during repeated discharging and charging cycles the unwanted insertion of li into the empty 16c octahedral sites can result in serious structural distortion huang et al 2021 liu et al 2019c sun et al 1999 which leads to mn2 release as a result of the disproportion reaction shown in eq 7 fortunately a recent study using a battery like system with self made lmo electrodes showed mn dissolution could remain at 0 077 at the li intercalation stage much lower than the portion of mn lost from an ion sieve material 4 14 during li uptake xu et al 2021 the pourbaix diagram of the li mn h2o system showed that the main cause of mn loss from cathode was the transformation of limn2o4 to soluble mn2 at the late intercalation stage when the potential decreased from 1 04 v to 0 47 v however an understanding of the effect of jahn teller distortion in the lmo lattice during the lithium recovery and further decrease the mn dissolution during the operations is still needed in theory lfp electrode should be structurally stable but extensive degradation has been reported in previous studies on li ion batteries and likely occurs in the lithium recovery systems the presence of so called antisite defects in which iron ions occupy the li sites is possibly one of the factors that block li diffusion through the lattice and cause capacity loss pender et al 2020 8 2 m n 3 m n 4 m n 2 strategies for improvement of the stability of lmo lncm electrodes have for the most part involved three methods of i doping with other metals such as ti al co and ni and ii surface modification with other materials such as rgo ppy and al2o3 guan et al 2011 iii structure optimization such as construction of truncated octahedral limn2o4 xu et al 2018 zhou et al 2022 while these methods have been used to suppress manganese dissolution and jahn teller distortions zhao et al 2020a zhao et al 2020b the results of long term stability tests provided in these studies are not particularly convincing because the prepared electrodes were only operated over 30 50 cycles different from li ion batteries other factors can affect the long term stability of the electrode in electrosorption based lithium recovery systems the major difference of an electrosorption based lithium recovery system from a li ion battery is that the electrolyte should be natural brine not an optimized lithium containing organic electrolyte the natural brine has a low lithium concentration and contains a large amount of other ions which might block the li channel by irreversible adsorption or intercalation in addition the dissolved oxygen organic matter and microorganisms might cause fouling on the electrode or unwanted side reactions for the application of the lithium recovery system for li mining from real brine more efforts would be required to understand the effect of the environment and develop new electrosorption systems that exhibit both longer cycle life and high tolerance to real water conditions 4 2 perspectives on electrodialysis the major membrane types and manufacturers operating conditions and li extraction performance of ed based systems are summarized in table 3 the prospects for full scale application of ed based systems for li recovery from aqueous sources are favorable ascribed to the ease of scale up the good ion separation ability and high production efficiency recent studies have shown that coupling ed with other desalination technologies is able to provide very high grade li products jiang et al 2014 qiu et al 2019b torres et al 2020 however there is still plenty of room for improvement of ed applications especially with regard to li selectivity ion leakage membrane scaling and scale up and commercialization section 5 2 4 2 1 li selectivity of ed the li selective permeability of monovalent iems is the primary reason for the success of application of ed in li recovery although cations such as na and k can have a strong negative impact on the li mg separation efficiency of monovalent iems chen et al 2018 ji et al 2018 one approach to improve membrane properties and li permselectivity involves membrane surface modification by coating li selective adsorbent materials or grafting an ion imprinted polymer on the membrane surface bajestani et al 2020 limjuco et al 2017 liu et al 2020c sharma et al 2020 another approach involves the introduction of pre and or post treatment steps to remove competing monovalent ions which is typically achieved by chemicals addition ix or nf furthermore integrating different ed applications such as sed and bmed may create an optimum production protocol for recovery of li product and by products for instance the bmed system is often placed after the sed process to obtain li product and hcl h3bo3 one example is the two step production of lioh from high mg li ratio brine by integrating sed and bmed fig 7 a qiu et al 2019b h2c2o4 and ix was used to remove ca2 and mg2 after the first stage sed subsequently licl was concentrated by 30 fold in the 2nd stage sed and 99 purity lioh and hcl were produced in the bmed stage some researchers have developed membrane electrolysis me processes to initially remove na k and mg2 nieto et al 2019 nieto et al 2020 pan et al 2020 torres et al 2020 a particularly promising approach involves use of a three stage me process for production of pure na2co3 and li2co3 fig 7b nieto et al 2019 nieto et al 2020 the first stage removes mg2 and ca2 by increasing catholyte ph via the water reduction reaction in the second stage co2 is injected into the crystalizer to preferentially precipitate nahco3 7 ph 9 thereby further increasing the li na ratio in solution the final stage uses the same technique to precipitate li as li2co3 at a higher ph the final grade of na2co3 and li2co3 has been shown to reach 99 5 and 93 8 final li solution 1 9 g l 1 respectively another interesting hybrid process that integrates me with a li capture electrode material in a redox flow battery configuration has recently been described fig 7c yu et al 2020 in the first stage li in the seawater stream was inserted into the working lmo electrode with the oxygen evolution reaction occuring in cell 1 in the second stage under reversed potential the released li migrated to cell 2 and was recovered as lioh using oh generated from the oxygen reduction process the negative effects of low li concentration were effectively alleviated by the rapid flow of feed solution thereby providing a continuous flux of fresh li to the electrode the adsorption capacity of the prototype cell reached 20 6 mg g 1 li after 0 8 h operation 4 2 2 ion leakage and membrane scaling although sed has been shown to be effective in recovering li from brines with high li mg ratios the rejection ability of the membrane declines with increasing mg2 level of impurities present in the li recovery solution ji et al 2017 nie et al 2017a in this case particular challenges are associated with ion leakage and membrane fouling as a result of ca mg precipitation during long term use the leakage of oh from cathodic reaction and h from anodic reaction are found in the sed system resulting in the precipitation of mg oh 2 on the cathode membrane and ph decrease in the concentrate compartment respectively qiu et al 2019b proton leakage also influences the formation of boric acid in the bmed system and limits the current efficiency and regeneration of acid or base routine membrane cleaning or reverse polarity operation are likely to be necessary for effective long term operation of ed systems the development and use of novel membranes that reduce proton leakage by for instance the introduction of hydrophobic groups on the membrane surface or use of denser membranes with more extensive cross linkage may be a possibility but also need to consider the resultant the increase of membrane resistance zhang et al 2019b in particular the novel ed membranes for li recovery should provide better mechanical and chemical stability with these membranes able to tolerate high applied potential and wide ph range pärnamäe et al 2021 5 comparative summaries and future applications of electrochemical processes for li recovery 5 1 current status of electrochemical process for li recovery as should be apparent from the information presented so far the two electrochemical processes for li recovery share some similarities but also exhibit significant differences in many aspects one of the most important differences is that electrosorption processes capture li based on li selective electrodes while electrodialysis processes are based on membrane separation as such most of the studies reported in the literature describe advances in development of electrode materials or membrane types typically with additional information on approaches to optimizing their performance in various ways for example electrosorption studies typically focus on aspects such as electrode capacity electrode stability the effect of co existing ions on electrode performance and optimal working potential range of the electrode while electrodialysis studies focus on the effect of co existing ions on membrane separation performance the extent of ion leakage through the membrane and membrane stability in addition the advantages and drawbacks of electrosorption and electrodialysis processes are also compared from different perspectives and with regard to different attributes as shown in table 4 the concentration of li in the water resource of interest plays an important role in the choice of an appropriate li recovery strategy most of the previous electrochemical studies have focused on synthetic solutions of composition similar to li rich brines in south america and china in which li concentrations are often more than 20 mm palagonia et al 2017 as such we may conclude that a reasonable li concentration is required to enable sufficient energy efficiency if electrochemical systems are to be used for li capture for example for electrosorption systems excessively low li concentrations 5 mm typically result in poor mass transfer and large polarization effects leading to high energy consumption and low li adsorption capacity for electrodialysis systems low li concentrations will result in low limiting current density and strong competition effects with co existing ions e g na with these effects hindering efficient transport of li through the iem therefore other technologies such as ion sieve adsorption would appear to be a better option when mining resources such as seawater or geothermal waters containing relatively low concentrations of li encouragingly some companies have developed commercial ion exchange resins and successfully used these resins in pilot and full scale plants for direct li extraction from geothermal brines lithium south development corporation 2021 vulcan energy resources limited 2021 in addition the spent libs leachate solution often contains a high concentration of li making it economically attractive compared to the use of seawater with comparatively low li concentration nevertheless electrosorption based technologies may not be suitable for this type of li feed stream because the dissolution of li selective electrodes may necessitate the use of highly acidic leachate solution mg li ratio could be another important factor for the selection of li recovery strategies high mg li mass ratios 6 in li rich salt lake sources remain a particular challenge for all li recovery technologies with no process currently available that is capable of efficient separation of li from solutions containing a high concentration of mg to understand how electrochemical processes perform in high mg li ratio brines the data from some typical electrosorption lfp lmo and lncm electrodes and electrodialysis sed and lmed studies are shown in fig 8 although most electrosorption studies involved investigations for brines at 10 mg li ratio their sfs were much larger than 10 and some electrodes were even able to reach nearly 600 fig 8a by contrast most electrodialysis studies used mg li ratios in the range of 20 100 and obtained lower sf 10 30 than achieved by electrosorption this result indicates that current electrosorption processes can achieve moderate to excellent sf in low mg li ratio source waters while current electrodialysis systems are more efficient for waters with higher mg li ratios however electrodialysis systems exhibited higher electrical energy consumption per unit mole of li recovered than electrosorption systems due to the high voltages 5 35 v that were typically used fig 8b 5 2 future application of electrochemical li recovery technologies while most of the existing studies that have been undertaken have been at bench scale the possibility of future translation of these technologies to industrial scale application requires verification of the performance of these technologies in scaled up studies using actual brine in this section we discuss the technology readiness level trl of the various electrochemically based li recovery processes and describe key outcomes of significant scaled up studies that have been undertaken recently the trl describes the maturity level of a technology during the acquisition phase with the scale ranging from level 1 basic principle to 9 commercial industrial applications adopted here from zavahir et al 2020 as shown in fig 9 the majority of electrochemical studies that have been reported in the literature are identified as lab scale validation research and as such can be categorized to be in the trl range of 4 to 6 for electrosorption systems the majority of current studies trl 5 63 3 are associated with aspects regarding development of electrode materials reactor configuration and operational mode the studies describing performance of pilot scale electrosorption systems tr7 only account for 3 3 of those related to use of electrosorption for li recovery while a higher proportion 10 of the studies describing performance of ed systems for li recovery were at pilot scale compared to electrosorption ed is a more mature technology that is readily scaled up for recovery of li from aqueous sources containing different concentrations of li for example sed can both concentrate li from low and high strength source waters and generate the final li products e g li2co3 and lioh particularly when integrated with other technologies such as nanofiltration and reverse osmosis qiu et al 2019b in addition bmed as an important variant of conventional ed has been employed to produce acid and base with the process design tailored to the particular source water bunani et al 2017b however considering the high cost of ionic liquids and superionic conductors additional effort to optimize the scale up of lmed and sced is required if these processes are to become economically viable electrochemical reactors for li recovery have been developed at pilot scale using different configurations of stack design and include the ag lmo fig 10 a fp lfp and lmo nihcf systems he et al 2018 joo et al 2020b palagonia et al 2020 encouragingly an industrial scale battery like electrosorption system has been constructed and operated by central south lithium co ltd in golmud qinghai fig 10b central south lithium company limited 2021 this system can concentrate li up to 20 30 g l 1 at an estimated operating cost of 15 000 20 000 rmb per tonne of li2co3 production a cost that is comparable to that of the conventional evaporation method xu et al 2020b although industrialization of the electrosorption process has advanced significantly in recent years full scale application of this technology is still in its infancy the most concerning aspect of this approach to li recovery is related to whether the current electrode materials are sufficiently effective and stable especially for complex water sources with a high content of impurity ions it is anticipated that breakthroughs in the development of new generations of electrode systems and electrode materials will occur with these developments critical to advancement of this approach to li recovery from brines and other aqueous sources in addition it is likely that we will see the electrosorption concept combined with other techniques such as ed nanofiltration nf and ion exchange ix to improve li production and quality in the future li et al 2019 have provided a comprehensive review of membrane technologies of use in li recovery with particular attention given to commercial viability and ease of scale up the analysis presented in this review shows that lmed and sced exhibit high selectivity for li with low energy consumption but difficulties in material preparation and scale up prohibit their commercialization provision of membranes and supply of electricity account for the major costs of the sed process in addition the costs associated with routine cleaning and other ancillary processes should also be considered hybrid processes are recognized to be the most cost effective means of li recovery at scale in the near future it has been reported that large scale sed modules integrated with ro ix and bmed will be implemented for recovery of li from salt lakes in western china qinghai salt lake industry group company limited 2020 indeed a hybrid plant equipped with ed and nf was constructed in east taijinar salt lake in china in 2019 and now reportedly has an annual productivity of 10 000 tonnes li2co3 99 6 purity fig 10c qinghai institute of salt lakes chinese academy of sciences 2018 it is almost certain that we will see further development of such hybrid plants for li recovery from brines in future particular issues that should be taken into account before industrial implementation i e trl 7 of the processes described above are summarized as follows in theory even though ed utilizes multiple commercial iem pairs that are particularly expensive some electrosorption systems such as battery like or hybrid capacitive deionization configurations will require the extensive use of iems on scaling up to the industrial level therefore a cost breakdown for individual components e g iem cost electrode cost is particularly important for reasonable comparison of electrosorption and ed processes in future studies ed can rapidly concentrate li from low li concentration to a target level in a relatively short time 1 6 h but demands a cell voltage between 5 and 35 v causing high energy consumption that increases operational cost electrosorption system runs at a lower voltage 3 5 v but often require a longer duration 18 h for completion of the intercalation deintercalation cycle as such an energy consumption analysis is required to determine the most energy efficient process when considering a broad range of operational parameters although both electrosorption and ed can treat high mg li ratio brines electrosorption systems possess intrinsic advantages with regard to li selectivity because the most mature ed system sed bmed is not capable of separating monovalent ions na k from li given that the removal of na k requires long term evaporation with associated loss of li this evaporation process can likely be avoided in an electrosorption system with resultant savings in cost and avoidance of li wastage 6 conclusions li recovery by electrochemically based methods including electrosorption and electrodialysis have been described in this review the basic principles cell configurations operation modes and electrode materials of electrosorption systems have been described the selectivity and purity of electrosorption based processes can now be achieved a at very high level with low energy cost however the translation from lab scale to industrial scale still awaits more viable electrode systems beyond current materials to achieve the multiple goals necessary for cost effective operation under real water conditions including large li recovery capacity high recovery rate sufficient li selectivity stable cyclic performance and low energy consumption in comparison the application of electrodialysis is relatively mature and is already being implemented at full scale at present sed and bmsed can concentrate and produce high purity li together with other products when integrated with other techniques to eliminate negative impacts hybrid processes based around ed are capable of energy efficient li recovery from salt lake brines and are now cost competitive with conventional approaches further attention to enhancement of li selectivity of iems is likely to see even greater efficiencies of li recovery using ed based hybrid processes in future declaration of competing interest there

low ozone gas concentrations long hydraulic retention times and high ha resulted in low dissolved ozone concentrations due to quenching of ozone by nom at specific ozone doses of 0 5 mg o3 mg doc and

comparable ozone doses and ha bromate formation in the multi tube contactor was always higher compared to single tube and batch ozonation this could be associated with the uneven ozone distribution within the multi tube contactor results show that ozone dose is the major driver for selectivity between bromate formation and nom color removal in both membrane and batch ozonation bromate formation

crittenden et al 2012 the two major oxidants in ozonation are ozone o3 and the hydroxyl radical oh formed during ozone decay gottschalk et al 2010 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in the treatment of groundwater ozonation is used for color removal lo tan and johnson 2001 rittmann et al 2002 in conjunction with biofiltration for natural organic matter nom removal to reduce disinfection by product formation during subsequent chlorination tubić et al 2011 and for disinfection tyrovola and diamadopoulos 2005 similarly ozonation has been applied in combination with groundwater recharge for disinfection nom and trace organic compound removal hübner et al 2012 zucker et al 2015 and in direct and indirect potable water reuse gerrity and snyder 2011 hooper et al 2020 however research on groundwater applications for ozone including groundwater remediation is still limited ying et al 2021 nom is a complex polymeric bulk material consisting of aromatic and non aromatic moieties derived from the decomposition of terrestrial plants and algae brezonik and arnold 2011 leenheer and croué 2003 dissolved nom occurs ubiquitously in natural waters at dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations of up to more than 100 mg doc l 1 while mostly in the range of 0 5 10 mg doc l 1 frimmel 1998 sillanpää 2015 presence of nom affects water treatment processes and drinking water quality in many ways for example as membrane foulant and during coagulation processes as cause of taste color and odor issues as major scavenger of chemical oxidants including ozone and as precursor of disinfection by products alhweij et al 2022 von gunten 2018 consequently understanding physical biological and chemical interactions of nom during water treatment is key to assess process performance and implications on final drinking water quality groundwater nom concentrations are typically below 4 mg doc l 1 regan et al 2017 rutlidge et al 2021 with a global median of 1 2 mg doc l 1 mcdonough et al 2020 comparatively high nom concentrations of up to 10 mg doc l 1 occur in some groundwaters in northern germany which is specifically associated with undesired elevated water color when such groundwaters are used for drinking water production schulz 2020 nom has high reaction rates with both ozone and hydroxyl radicals von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the reactivity of nom with ozone can vary with its specific composition and the chemical structure of its compounds buffle et al 2006 westerhoff et al 1999 ozone itself reacts preferably by electrophilic addition with electron rich moieties in nom such as double bonds and activated aromatic moieties such as phenols önnby et al 2018 while hydroxyl radicals formed during ozonation react less specifically and can also oxidize less electron rich moieties remucal et al 2020 ozonation induces reduction of spectroscopic i e light absorbing and light emitting properties of nom such as specific ultraviolet absorbance suva254 and fluorescence leresche et al 2019 and its electron donating capacity rougé et al 2020 walpen et al 2020 specifically ozone attacks the aromatic moieties of nom that define its optical properties sharpless and blough 2014 via electrophilic addition followed by ring cleavage wenk et al 2013 the presence of naturally occurring bromide br in groundwater may complicate the ozonation process during ozonation br reacts with ozone to form bromate bro3 sobhani et al 2012 von gunten 2003 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 bromate is a regulated by product of ozonation limited to maximum drinking water

parameters including ozone dose bromide concentration ph and alkalinity yang et al 2019 bromate formation is reduced in the presence of nom due to an overall reduction of ozone and hydroxyl radical exposure song et al 1996 westerhoff et al 1998 and reaction of hypobromous acid hobr an intermediate of the bromate formation pathway with nom heeb et al 2014 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 to control bromate formation during ozonation of drinking water and wastewater addition of ammonia ozonation at decreased ph and addition of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 have been applied pinkernell and von gunten 2001 soltermann et al 2017 these methods increase treatment effort by additional dosing needs of chemicals and possibly subsequent removal or neutralization given regulated requirements for finished drinking water e g in germany 0 5 mg l 1 ammonia ph 6 5 caco3 dissolution capacity 5 mg l 1 caco3 0 1 mg l 1 h2o2 trinkwasserverordnung 2001 moreover h2o2 addition was shown to slightly decrease ultraviolet light uv254 absorption reduction and humic substances removal in surface water treatment beniwal et al 2018 stylianou et al 2018a and may therefore also result in lower color removal than ozonation alone thus bromate mitigation methods without additional chemical dosing are attractive for groundwater decolorization membrane ozonation has been suggested as an alternative ozone gas transfer method over conventional bubble based methods used in water treatment due to potential advantages such as enhanced ozonation efficiency and better process control as reviewed recently merle et al 2017 schmitt et al 2020 the main feature of membrane ozonation is the spatial separation of gas and liquid by a membrane this allows adjusting for specific ozone doses needed for target compound removal by different combinations of ozone gas concentration and hydraulic retention time which has been investigated for membrane based peroxone oxidation ozonation with h2o2 dosing merle et al 2017 stylianou et al 2018b it was observed that a combination of long hydraulic retention times and low ozone gas concentrations resulted in significantly lower bromate concentrations compared to short hydraulic retention times and high ozone gas concentrations the effect was ascribed to low dissolved ozone concentration by ozone quenching of h2o2 dissolved organic matter can quench ozone at rates that outcompete the reaction of h2o2 with ozone buffle et al 2006 pocostales et al 2010 thus it is hypothesized that dissolved ozone concentrations and bromate formation in membrane ozonation may be controlled in the presence of nom in gas liquid transfer processes with chemical reaction including membrane ozonation the ratio of chemical reaction rate to mass transfer rate is a critical parameter as it comprises information about the concentration profiles of the reactants in the liquid side and the degree of mass transfer limitation of the system beltrán 1995 this ratio can be quantified with the hatta number ha which can be calculated for the case of first order ozone decay by using eq 1 charpentier 1981 eq 1 applies the film theory that assumes a stagnant liquid film between the membrane surface and the well mixed bulk liquid and is frequently used in membrane ozonation models due to its simplicity berry et al 2017 phattaranawik et al 2005 1 h a d o 3 k o 3 k l do3 is the diffusion coefficient of ozone in water kl is the liquid side ozone mass transfer coefficient and ko3 is the first order ozone decay rate for the second exponential phase of

or moderately fast regime 0 3 ha 3 reactions take place both in the liquid film and in the bulk liquid resulting in prevalently low bulk liquid ozone concentrations at fast kinetic regimes ha 3 ozone is completely depleted in the liquid film inhibiting ozonation reactions in the bulk liquid to our knowledge there are no studies investigating the effects of ha on bromate formation in membrane ozonation directly the aims of this study were 1 to investigate if bromate formation in the ozonation of a colored groundwater could be controlled by membrane ozonation and 2 to study the effects of the process parameters namely ozone dose gas concentration hydraulic retention time and ha on the competition between nom degradation and bromate formation a single tube membrane ozonation contactor with a non porous polydimethylsiloxane pdms membrane was used to study fundamental effects of these process parameters on ozonation performance of natural groundwater a larger multi tube contactor with porous polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membranes was used to assess whether these findings were similar irrespective of membrane material and build as an external benchmark conventional batch ozonation was compared to the results of membrane ozonation 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sample a batch of 60 l of treated groundwater was sampled at a drinking water treatment plant in northern germany in february 2020 the water had undergone treatment with aeration calcium hydroxide flocculation and softening two stage sand filtration and subsequent carbon dioxide removal by degassing ozonation relevant properties of the water are shown in table 1 2 2 chemicals oxygen for ozone production was of 99 5 purity boc guildford uk for membrane ozonation and of 99 95 purity westfalen münster germany for batch experiments chemicals and analytical consumables were purchased from sigma aldrich or fisher scientific ultrapure water resistivity 18 mω cm 1 and deionized water were produced with a milli q merck darmstadt germany water purification system for batch ozonation or an elga veolia paris france system for membrane ozonation 2 3 experimental procedure membrane ozonation experiments were conducted using two different setups described below batch ozonation was performed via addition of an ozone stock solution experiments were performed in duplicate at 16 1 c mean values and standard deviations were calculated from these duplicates 2 3 1 single tube membrane ozonation the first membrane ozonation setup referred to as single tube contactor fig 1 a consisted of a single tubular non porous pdms membrane silastic tubing cole parmer uk fixed at the central axis of a glass cylinder and is described in detail elsewhere zoumpouli et al 2018 membrane specifications are summarized in table 2 for single tube membrane ozonation experiments the gas flow rate through the contactor was set to 100 ml min 1 gas residence time of 30 s a flow split was used that by passed a portion of the inlet gas directly into the waste stream to simultaneously achieve low ozone concentrations and low gas flow rates entering the contactor experiments with different ozone concentrations in the feed gas were performed 25 to 197 g o3 m 3 both feed gas and feed water were supplied in single pass continuous mode the water flow rate was measured gravimetrically and set to 1 2 2 6 5 0 or 9 7 ml min 1 resulting in hydraulic retention times in the membrane reactor of 2 to 20 s see table s1 formation of few small gas bubbles was observed inside the membrane tube at water flow rates of 1 2 and 2 6 ml min 1 due to fast oxygen ozone transfer through the membrane the system was left to equilibrate for at least 10 min before samples were taken from a sampling port at the single tube contactor outlet the minimum time required to achieve stable ozone transfer conditions had been determined in previous experiments zoumpouli et al 2018 samples for dissolved ozone measurements were quenched with indigo see section 2 4 for details while samples for light absorbance and bromate measurements were not quenched but carefully filled from bottom to top with no headspace and stored in the dark at room temperature for several hours allowing for reactions to proceed until complete ozone depletion 2 3 2 multi tube membrane ozonation the second membrane ozonation module referred to as multi tube contactor fig 1 b was a custom made hollow fiber unit at half the size of commercial modules and provided by markel corp plymouth meeting pa usa the module consisted of a stainless steel housing containing 490 porous ptfe membrane fibers further details are listed in table 2 the module was installed vertically and operated in either co current or counter current flow with gas in the shell and liquid in the lumen gas was distributed within the module through a perforated tube located at the central axis of the module figure s1 for multi tube membrane ozonation experiments an oxygen flow rate into the ozone generator of 1000 ml min 1 was used resulting in a gas residence time in the membrane module of less than 1 min experiments with different ozone concentrations in the feed gas were performed at 25 to 71 g o3 m 3 the water flow rate was measured volumetrically and set to 400 680 or 920 ml min 1 resulting in hydraulic retention times of 26 to 60 s see table s2 at 400 ml min 1 the liquid side pressure was increased by partially closing the needle valve to avoid formation of gas bubbles while the pump provided sufficient pressure at higher flow rates see table s2 the system was left to equilibrate for at least 4 min to provide more than four times the hydraulic retention time in the module before samples were taken the experiments were performed in counter current flow for water and ozone gas at the lowest liquid side flow rate of 400 ml min 1 an additional setup with co current flow was implemented by inverting the gas flow direction samples were taken with the same procedure as described for single tube membrane ozonation 2 3 3 batch ozonation batch ozonation experiments were performed in 100 ml doc free glass flasks containing 70 ml of water sample with injection of an ozone stock solution the applied specific ozone doses were 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 6 1 0 and 1 5 mg o3 mg doc ozone for the batch experiments was produced from oxygen using a lab ozonizer 301 7 sander uetze elze germany water for the stock solution was of ultrapure grade and maintained at the sample temperature of 16 c during preparation ozone concentration in the stock solution was 21 1 mg l 1 as measured by uv absorption molar attenuation coefficient 3200 m 1 cm 1 at 260 nm von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the injection of ozone stock solution was done using a syringe extended with ptfe tubing to ensure submerged ozone dosing samples were stirred with a ptfe coated magnetic stirrer during ozone addition and for at least 20 s afterwards for complete mixing samples were stored at 16 c in the dark analysis took place on the subsequent day after filling up all water samples with ultrapure water to a volume of 100 ml the resulting dilution factor of the water 1 43 was multiplied with the analytical values for uv254 vis436 and bromate to allow comparison with the membrane ozonation results kinetic batch experiments were performed for specific ozone doses of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 mg o3 mg doc in a batch setup with a dispenser mounted on the flask from which samples were taken at regular time intervals ozone stock solution was added with a syringe via a side socket equipped with a septum and cannula stock solution addition took place below the reactor water level for about 20 s before sampling at regular defined time intervals commenced a lab dispenser was used for sampling for residual ozone measurements with indigo see section 2 4 for details stirring was discontinued 60 s after stock solution addition to prevent volatilization of ozone no significant loss of ozone in the reactor was found over the experimental duration of 20 min in tests using 20 mm h3po4 at ph 2 2 4 analytical techniques the concentration of dissolved residual ozone in the water outlet of each membrane contactor and in stock solution experiments was measured with the indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 all samples except for those for dissolved ozone toc and ph were filtered prior to analysis using 0 45 µm polypropylene syringe filters vwr international radnor us absorbance measurements at 254 and 436 nm and wavelength scans 190 700 nm 0 5 nm increment were performed with a hach lange dr 5000 spectrophotometer hach loveland usa using 5 cm quartz glass cuvettes all absorbance measurements were corrected by the absorbance of ultrapure water bromate concentrations were measured by ion chromatography ic with post column reaction and uv detection of triiodide iso 2011 a metrohm ic with an asupp16 column metrohm ag herisau switzerland was used bromide was measured by ion chromatography with uv detection using the same metrohm ic with an asupp5 column toc and doc were quantified as non purgeable organic carbon with the toc analyser toc l shimadzu corp kyoto japan using combustion catalytic oxidation at 680 c coupled with a nondispersive infrared sensor the ph of the feed water was measured with a fe20 ph meter mettler toledo leicester uk 2 5 ozone mass transfer calculations although small ozone concentration differences between inlet and outlet gas were detected for both membrane ozonation contactors it was not possible to accurately determine the transferred ozone dose from a gas side mass balance therefore uv254 reduction was used as a proxy for the ozone dose this approach was chosen because uv254 has been established as a surrogate parameter for oxidant exposure in ozonation processes e g for micropollutant degradation and bromate formation chon et al 2015 or to quantify the formation of biodegradable organic carbon during ozonation li et al 2017 specific ozone doses applied in membrane ozonation were approximated from the results of the batch experiments of which the ozone dose was known for calculations see si section s1 3 ozone decay in natural waters is usually modeled as a biphasic process consisting of an initial rapid ozone consumption phase and a slower secondary phase assuming first order exponential ozone decay elovitz et al 2000 westerhoff et al 1999 this secondary phase can be modeled using a first order ozone decay rate ko3 which was also used here to calculate ha of membrane ozonation eq 1 to obtain ko3 of membrane ozonation experiments an exponential fitting of ko3 after 15 s of reaction versus the ozone dose from kinetic batch experiments was used the fitting was calculated from the data of ozone doses of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 mg o3 mg doc table s7 figure s2 the fitting was performed in origin originlab northampton usa with an exponential function of the form y y0 a exp r0x where y is the ozone decay rate ko3 in s 1 and x is the ozone dose in mg o3 mg doc figure s3 fitting parameters are the offset y0 the initial value a and the rate r0 the results of the fitting were y0 0 0024 s 1 a 0 30 s 1 and r0 3 8 mg doc mg o3 using that function the first order ozone decay rate ko3 was estimated for each membrane ozonation experiment ha was calculated by using overall ozone decay rates ko3 determined at the contactor outlets accounting for the overall ozone dose that the water received the liquid side ozone mass transfer coefficient kl phattaranawik et al 2005 was calculated by eq 2 from the liquid side sherwood number shl the diffusion coefficient of ozone in water at 16 c do3 and the membrane inner diameter dm in the sherwood number was calculated based on the lévêque correlation lévêque 1928 and is explained in detail in the si section s1 4 the gas side and membrane mass transfer coefficients were calculated and presented in the si section s1 4 table s5 2 k l s h l d o 3 d m i n 3 results and discussion 3 1 ozone mass transfer in membrane ozonation the two membrane contactors used in this study obtained different membrane materials and module geometry table 2 however the experimental overall mass transfer coefficient was similar in both contactors table s5 the theoretical overall mass transfer coefficient in the multi tube contactor was higher than the experimental one which may be due to non ideal flow conditions within the module the experimental conditions for groundwater ozonation i e feed gas ozone concentrations and hydraulic retention times were chosen to achieve a similar range of residual dissolved ozone concentrations for both membrane contactors the range of residual dissolved ozone concentration at the contactor outlet was 0 0 6 4 mg l 1 for the single tube contactor fig 2 a and 0 0 7 2 mg l 1 for the multi tube contactor fig 2 b at the same dissolved ozone concentration the transferred ozone dose may be higher in the multi tube contactor due to increased hydraulic retention time and therefore increased ozone consumption within the module changing the flow mode to co current in the multi tube contactor decreased dissolved ozone concentrations slightly fig 2 b which was expected due to the decreasing concentration difference between gas and liquid side which is the driving force for mass transfer atchariyawut et al 2007 zero outlet concentrations of ozone were measured at ozone doses below 2 mg l 1 in both contactors figure s4 indicating rapid initial ozone consumption this is due to fast reactions of nom and other water matrix constituents and is referred to as the immediate ozone demand schmitt et al 2020 at ozone doses above the immediate ozone demand which applies for hydraulic retention times of 9 2 and 20 s in the single tube contactor and for all hydraulic retention times in the multi tube contactor dissolved ozone concentrations increased with both hydraulic retention time and ozone gas concentration in agreement with previous studies kaprara et al 2020 stylianou et al 2016 zoumpouli et al 2018 in fact a linear relationship between dissolved ozone in groundwater and ozone gas concentration was observed when exceeding the immediate ozone demand fig 2 figure s4 additional experiments with ultrapure water i e without an ozone sink with the multi tube contactor see figure s5 resulted in similar slopes as for the ozonation of groundwater e g for 60 s hydraulic retention time m 0 12 0 003 for groundwater and m 0 13 0 003 for ultrapure water however a concentration offset in groundwater ozonation was visible due to the immediate ozone demand and resulted in negative y intercepts 2 0 0 10 mg l 1 x0 1 1 0 13 mg l 1 in groundwater versus 0 90 0 38 mg l 1 x0 0 32 0 45 mg l 1 in ultrapure water liquid side mass transfer coefficients kl for the membrane contactors were calculated based on eq 2 the single tube contactor exhibited generally higher kl values than the multi tube contactor 6 90 10 6 m s 1 kl 1 38 10 5 m s 1 for the single tube contactor table s1 versus 4 87 10 6 m s 1 kl 6 43 10 6 m s 1 for the multi tube contactor table s2 reaction conditions in the membrane ozonation contactors were compared based on the dimensionless hatta number ha fig 3 ha values of 0 31 1 72 in the moderately fast regime 0 3 ha 3 were obtained indicating that reactions took place both in the liquid film and in the bulk this is comparable to the membrane ozonation of nom isolates at ph 7 and 2 66 0 4 mg doc l 1 that resulted in ha of 0 52 0 82 leiknes et al 2005 zero outlet concentrations of dissolved ozone which were obtained by a combination of short hydraulic retention times and low feed gas ozone concentrations were correlated with ha 1 in the single tube contactor indicating the liquid film as the main reaction zone leiknes et al 2005 in multi tube ozonation a zero outlet ozone concentration was obtained at ha 1 67 only dissolved ozone concentrations of the multi tube contactor were slightly higher than in the single tube contactor at similar ha values according to eq 1 similar ha values imply lower ko3 and therefore higher ozone dose in the multi tube contactor than in the single tube contactor to make up for the lower kl of the multi tube contactor moreover in the multi tube contactor a transversal ozone concentration gradient on the gas side is established due to the distribution of ozone from a single central tube see figure s1 and methods section 2 3 for details this implies that membrane fibers near the center receive more ozone than those located further towards the outer wall of the contactor inner fibers might have received higher specific ozone doses resulting in depletion of fast reacting nom moieties and elevated overall residual ozone concentrations at the contactor outlet 3 2 transformation of groundwater nom in batch ozonation uv vis absorbance spectra for groundwater as absolute values are shown for batch experiments in fig 4 a and the inlet fig 4 b covering the visible light region that showed low absorbance nom typically exhibits an exponential decrease in absorption with increasing wavelength that can be modeled with the function a λ a λr exp s λ λr where a is the absorbance at wavelength λ λr is the reference wavelength and s is the spectral slope twardowski et al 2004 fig 4 c shows relative absorbance compared to the initial non ozonated sample absorbance generally decreased steadily with increasing ozone dose and to similar extent for wavelengths below 350 nm fig 4 c at wavelengths above 350 nm a smaller decrease or even small increases in absorbance for wavelengths above 375 nm were observed at lower ozone doses color i e absorbance at 436 nm was therefore increased at ozone doses below 0 4 mg o3 mg doc moreover at these ozone doses spectral slopes decreased figure s6 this is in contrast with previous findings of consistently increasing spectral slopes for nom isolates with increasing ozone doses including at low ozone doses wenk et al 2013 to further investigate this phenomenon liquid chromatography with subsequent organic carbon detection lc ocd analyses and additional ozonation experiments with pre filtered samples were conducted lc ocd chromatograms data from the additional experiments and a detailed explanation are given in the si section s2 2 figures s7 and s8 in short the humic substances organic carbon oc peak shifted to smaller retention times at low ozone doses indicating that high molecular nom with contribution to vis436 was released from colloidal nom fractions at ozonation pre microfiltration 0 1 or 0 45 µm of the samples reduced the increase in vis436 at low ozone doses which demonstrates that the nom compounds with contribution to vis436 originate from such colloidal nom fractions 3 3 color removal and bromate formation in membrane and batch ozonation despite the initial visible absorbance increase at low ozone doses which was similar across the three experimental setups both membrane and batch ozonation led to a significant decrease in vis436 from initially 0 5 m 1 to values under 0 2 m 1 at 1 5 mg o3 mg doc the highest ozone dose tested fig 5 a vis436 decrease at 1 0 mg o3 mg doc was 60 which was slightly lower than expected from previous studies on color removal in wastewater color measured at 455 nm wert et al 2009 and groundwater color measured at 408 nm rittmann et al 2002 both of which reported a color decrease of 80 at 1 0 mg o3 mg doc we attribute the lower decolorization efficacy in this groundwater sample to the initial increase of color at lower ozone doses see section 3 2 small variation in vis436 at comparable ozone dose i e at comparable uv254 reduction was observed in the different ozonation setups it is viable that the different ozone dosing mechanisms affected reaction conditions in the membrane contactors if a significant amount of ozone reacts within the liquid film i e at ha 1 leiknes et al 2005 ozone and hydroxyl radical exposure of water constituents may vary spatially in the liquid film ozone may be consumed quickly by fast reacting nom moieties jansen et al 2005 the hydroxyl radical exposure may not be affected by this as it depends on the consumed amount of ozone and not the ozone exposure kwon et al 2017 however as ha was in the moderately fast regime 0 3 ha 3 for membrane ozonation experiments in this study we believe that the effect of varied hydroxyl radical to ozone exposure ratios on uv254 and vis436 was minor and within the experimental error results for color removal for the single tube contactor were more scattered compared to the multi tube contactor and batch ozonation this is probably due to the larger variation of mass transfer conditions in the single tube contactor ratio of highest and lowest kl 2 0 ratio of highest and lowest ozone feed gas concentration 8 0 table s1 compared to the multi tube contactor ratio of highest and lowest kl 1 3 ratio of highest and lowest ozone feed gas concentration 2 8 table s2 which may have expanded the range of results and underlines an association between mass transfer conditions and final water quality bromate concentrations remained generally below the who guideline value of 10 µg l 1 for ozone doses below 0 5 mg o3 mg doc for all ozonation setups fig 5 b at higher ozone doses bromate formation increased drastically to concentrations of up to 103 µg l 1 resulting in a molar bromide to bromate conversion of up to 78 a similar relationship between bromate formation and ozone dose has been described previously for wastewater effluents and surface water li et al 2017 indicating that these results can also be translated into groundwater treatment at specific ozone doses below 0 5 mg o3 mg doc single tube ozonation resulted in lower or similar bromate formation compared to batch ozonation this was inverted at higher ozone doses which resulted in significantly higher bromate concentrations of single tube compared to batch ozonation similarly it was found in previous studies that bromate formation in membrane peroxone processes may either be lower or higher than in batch peroxone processes merle et al 2017 stylianou et al 2018b lower bromate formation in the membrane peroxone process than in batch ozonation was only found at ozone gas concentrations of 0 5 1 0 g o3 m 3 merle et al 2017 which is more than one order of magnitude lower than used in the study presented here in single tube ozonation a decrease in bromate concentration was observed with increasing hydraulic retention time i e with decreasing ozone gas concentration at comparable ozone dose fig 5 b clusters i and ii this is in agreement with the results of previous studies on membrane peroxone application merle et al 2017 stylianou et al 2018b and suggests that bromate control in nom rich groundwater may be achieved without addition of h2o2 multi tube membrane ozonation produced higher bromate concentrations than the other two setups tested despite longer hydraulic retention times and lower ozone gas concentrations than used in the single tube contactor the higher bromate formation in the multi tube contactor may be due to the uneven ozone distribution within the module we assume that bromate formation was higher in some membrane fibers due to elevated ozone dose which might have resulted in an increased bromate concentration of the final contactor effluent in the multi tube contactor only slight variation in bromate formation was observed which may be due to the small variation in experimental conditions see above figure s9 shows color vis436 versus bromate for all ozonation setups at comparable vis436 abatement bromate formation was in the order batch single tube contactor multi tube contactor indicating more selective vis436 reduction over bromate formation in batch and single tube ozonation at enhanced color removal i e vis436 0 3 m 1 bromate formation in the single tube contactor was higher than in batch ozonation these results are in accordance with the varying bromate formation in the different ozonation setups fig 5 b at bromate concentrations below 10 µg l 1 color removal of up to 45 for the single tube contactor and batch ozonation and 17 for the multi tube contactor could be achieved the color removal performance by ozonation in other groundwaters may be higher as the increase in color at low ozone doses shown here was not observed in the ozonation of other groundwaters rittmann et al 2002 sobhani et al 2012 fig 5 c shows ha for membrane ozonation as a function of specific ozone dose ha decreased with specific ozone dose because of decreasing ozone decay rate ko3 at constant specific ozone dose ha increased with increasing hydraulic retention time and therefore decreasing flow velocity zoumpouli et al 2018 clusters i and ii of fig 5 c highlight data points with comparable ozone dose and increase of ha with hydraulic retention time for these clusters bromate formation decreased for increasing hydraulic retention time and therefore higher ha as highlighted in fig 5 b ha indicates if the ozone concentration in the liquid film is controlled by mass transfer or reaction at increased ha mass transfer limitation and therefore competition between different reactants for ozone may increase beltrán 1995 it is plausible that high reaction rates of nom with ozone may decrease ozone exposure for compounds with slower ozone reaction kinetics and thereby decrease bromate formation at increased ha despite higher ha in the multi tube contactor than in the single tube contactor at comparable ozone dose fig 5 c bromate formation was higher in the multi tube contactor fig 5 b ha was calculated for the overall ozone dose charged to the multi tube contactor as the ozone dose is assumed to vary within the membrane fibers see above ha is also expected to vary this makes direct comparison to a single tube contactor less straightforward ha 1 i e faster reaction than mass transfer rate in the liquid film leiknes et al 2005 were obtained at specific ozone doses 0 5 mg o3 mg doc for both membrane contactors at these ozone doses bromate formation was similar in the single tube contactor compared to batch ozonation fig 5b at higher ozone dose bromate formation in the single tube contactor exceeded bromate formation in batch ozonation the application of ozone doses 0 5 mg o3 mg doc at a lower bromate formation than observed here might be feasible if the ozone gas concentration is further decreased and the hydraulic retention time is further increased the use of ha to indicate enhanced competition between nom degradation and bromate formation in membrane ozonation may help in experimental and contactor design to perform membrane ozonation under mass transfer limited conditions this knowledge may be applied to other treatment targets that aspire selective ozonation zero outlet ozone concentrations can serve as an indicator for high ha fig 3 membrane contactor design to achieve high ha would imply both large diameter and length as both decrease kl eq 2 eq s1 s4 as kl is usually the limiting factor for mass transfer in membrane ozonation pines et al 2005 this may increase the capital costs and footprint of membrane ozonation contactors on the other hand the pumping energy demand may be reduced at low flow velocities gottschalk et al 2010 large scale energy demand and cost assessments of membrane ozonation are required to fully assess the potential of membrane ozonation under different operating conditions bein et al 2020 to induce more uniform mass transfer conditions in multi tube hollow fiber modules ozone gas distribution should be optimized e g by increasing the distance between the tubes 4 conclusions color vis436 and ultraviolet light absorbance uv254 of a groundwater could be significantly reduced by ozonation however high bromide levels resulted in bromate concentrations beyond the who guideline value 10 µg l 1 for specific ozone doses 0 5 mg o3 mg doc at lower ozone doses high reaction rates of natural organic matter nom and ozone resulted in low dissolved ozone concentrations and controlled bromate formation in membrane ozonation conditions associated with a low mass transfer rate low ozone gas concentration long hydraulic retention time high hatta number ha showed lower bromate formation at comparable ozone dose than inverse conditions bromate formation in the single tube contactor was higher than in batch ozonation if specific ozone doses 0 5 mg o3 mg doc were applied with ha 1 at specific ozone doses 0 5 mg o3 mg doc bromate formation was comparable or lower in single tube ozonation compared to batch ozonation this was associated with ha 1 which implies mass transfer limitation of ozone in the membrane contactor longer hydraulic retention time and lower ozone gas concentrations may further depress bromate formation also at higher ozone doses as process settings with high ha were beneficial for increasing the selectivity of nom degradation over bromate formation further research is needed on large scale implementation of high ha membrane ozonation design for optimization of both water quality and treatment costs dissolved ozone concentration at the membrane ozonation contactor outlet might be a useful and simple parameter to assess ha of the process zero outlet concentrations of dissolved ozone were measured for ha 1 in single tube ozonation and ha 1 67 in multi tube ozonation uneven transversal ozone distribution inside a multi tube contactor appeared to increase bromate formation which was generally higher compared to single tube ozonation at comparable ozone dose and ha thus specific ozone dose and ha are not recommended as the only parameters to explain differences in water quality after treatment by different membrane contactors the identification of further parameters to quantify ozonation selectivity of target compound removal over by product formation in membrane contactors

low ozone gas concentrations long hydraulic retention times and high ha resulted in low dissolved ozone concentrations due to quenching of ozone by nom at specific ozone doses of 0 5 mg o3 mg doc and

crittenden et al 2012 the two major oxidants in ozonation are ozone o3 and the hydroxyl radical oh formed during ozone decay gottschalk et al 2010 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in the treatment of groundwater ozonation is used for color removal lo tan and johnson 2001 rittmann et al 2002 in conjunction with biofiltration for natural organic matter nom removal to reduce disinfection by product formation during subsequent chlorination tubić et al 2011 and for disinfection tyrovola and diamadopoulos 2005 similarly ozonation has been applied in combination with groundwater recharge for disinfection nom and trace organic compound removal hübner et al 2012 zucker et al 2015 and in direct and indirect potable water reuse gerrity and snyder 2011 hooper et al 2020 however research on groundwater applications for ozone including groundwater remediation is still limited ying et al 2021 nom is a complex polymeric bulk material consisting of aromatic and non aromatic moieties derived from the decomposition of terrestrial plants and algae brezonik and arnold 2011 leenheer and croué 2003 dissolved nom occurs ubiquitously in natural waters at dissolved organic carbon doc

in many ways for example as membrane foulant and during coagulation processes as cause of taste color and odor issues as major scavenger of chemical oxidants including ozone and as precursor of disinfection by products alhweij et al 2022 von gunten 2018 consequently understanding physical biological and chemical interactions of nom during water treatment is key to assess process performance and implications on final drinking water quality groundwater nom concentrations are typically below 4 mg doc l 1 regan et al 2017 rutlidge et al 2021 with a global median of 1 2 mg doc l 1 mcdonough et al 2020 comparatively high nom concentrations of up to 10 mg doc l 1 occur in some groundwaters in northern germany which is specifically associated with undesired elevated water color when such groundwaters are used for drinking water production schulz 2020 nom has high reaction rates with both ozone and hydroxyl radicals von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the reactivity of nom with ozone can vary with its specific composition and the chemical structure of its compounds buffle et al 2006 westerhoff et al 1999 ozone itself reacts preferably by electrophilic addition with electron rich moieties in nom such as double bonds and activated aromatic moieties such as phenols önnby et al 2018 while hydroxyl radicals formed during ozonation react less specifically and can also oxidize less electron rich moieties remucal et al 2020 ozonation induces reduction of spectroscopic i e light absorbing and light emitting properties of nom such as specific ultraviolet absorbance suva254 and

parameters including ozone dose bromide concentration ph and alkalinity yang et al 2019 bromate formation is reduced in the presence of nom due to an overall reduction of ozone and hydroxyl radical exposure song et al 1996 westerhoff et al 1998 and reaction of hypobromous acid hobr an intermediate of the bromate formation pathway with nom heeb et al 2014 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 to control bromate formation during ozonation of drinking water and wastewater addition of ammonia ozonation at decreased ph and addition of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 have been applied pinkernell and von gunten 2001 soltermann et al 2017 these methods increase treatment effort by additional dosing needs of chemicals and possibly subsequent removal or neutralization given regulated requirements for finished drinking water e g in germany 0 5 mg l 1 ammonia ph 6 5 caco3 dissolution capacity 5 mg l 1 caco3 0 1 mg l 1 h2o2 trinkwasserverordnung 2001 moreover h2o2 addition was shown to slightly decrease ultraviolet light uv254 absorption reduction and humic substances removal in surface water treatment beniwal et al 2018 stylianou et al 2018a and may therefore also result in lower color removal than ozonation alone thus bromate mitigation methods without additional chemical dosing are attractive for groundwater decolorization membrane ozonation has been suggested as an alternative ozone gas transfer method over conventional bubble based methods used in water treatment due to potential advantages such as enhanced ozonation efficiency and better process control as reviewed recently merle et al 2017 schmitt et al 2020 the main feature of membrane ozonation is the spatial separation of gas and liquid by a membrane this allows adjusting for specific ozone doses needed for target compound removal by different combinations of ozone gas concentration and hydraulic retention time which has been investigated for membrane based peroxone oxidation ozonation with h2o2 dosing merle et al 2017 stylianou et al 2018b it was observed that a combination of long hydraulic retention times and low ozone gas concentrations resulted in significantly lower bromate concentrations compared to short hydraulic retention times and high ozone gas concentrations the effect was ascribed to low dissolved ozone concentration by ozone quenching of h2o2 dissolved organic matter can quench ozone at rates that outcompete the reaction of h2o2 with ozone buffle et al 2006 pocostales et al 2010 thus it is hypothesized that dissolved ozone concentrations and bromate formation in membrane ozonation may be controlled in the presence of nom in gas liquid transfer processes with chemical reaction including membrane ozonation the ratio of chemical reaction rate to mass transfer rate is a critical parameter as it comprises information about the concentration profiles of the reactants in the liquid side and the degree of mass transfer limitation of the system beltrán 1995 this ratio can be quantified with the hatta number ha which can be calculated for the case of first order ozone decay by using eq 1 charpentier 1981 eq 1 applies the film theory that assumes a stagnant liquid film between the membrane surface and the well mixed bulk liquid and is frequently used in membrane ozonation models due to its simplicity berry et al 2017 phattaranawik et al 2005 1 h a d o 3 k o 3 k l do3 is the diffusion coefficient of ozone in water kl is the liquid side ozone mass transfer coefficient and ko3 is the first order ozone decay rate for the second exponential phase of

or moderately fast regime 0 3 ha 3 reactions take place both in the liquid film and in the bulk liquid resulting in prevalently low bulk liquid ozone concentrations at fast kinetic regimes ha 3 ozone is completely depleted in the liquid film inhibiting ozonation reactions in the bulk liquid to our knowledge there are no studies investigating the effects of ha on bromate formation in membrane ozonation directly the aims of this study were 1 to investigate if bromate formation in the ozonation of a colored groundwater could be controlled by membrane ozonation and 2 to study the effects of the process parameters namely ozone dose gas concentration hydraulic retention time and ha on the competition between nom degradation and bromate formation a single tube membrane ozonation contactor with a non porous polydimethylsiloxane pdms membrane was used to study fundamental effects of these process parameters on ozonation performance of natural groundwater a larger multi tube contactor with porous polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membranes was used to assess whether these findings were similar irrespective of membrane material and build as an external benchmark conventional batch ozonation was compared to the results of membrane ozonation 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sample a batch of 60 l of treated groundwater was sampled at a drinking water treatment plant in northern germany in february 2020 the water had undergone treatment with aeration calcium hydroxide flocculation and softening two stage sand filtration and subsequent carbon dioxide removal by degassing ozonation relevant properties of the water are shown in table 1 2 2 chemicals oxygen for ozone production was of 99 5 purity boc guildford uk for membrane ozonation and of 99 95 purity westfalen münster germany for batch experiments chemicals and analytical consumables were purchased from sigma aldrich or fisher scientific ultrapure water resistivity 18 mω cm 1 and deionized water were produced with a milli q merck darmstadt germany water purification system for batch ozonation or an elga veolia paris france system for membrane ozonation 2 3 experimental procedure membrane ozonation experiments were conducted using two different setups described below batch ozonation was performed via addition of an ozone stock solution experiments were performed in duplicate at 16 1 c mean values and standard deviations were calculated from these duplicates 2 3 1 single tube membrane ozonation the first membrane ozonation setup referred to as single tube contactor fig 1 a consisted of a single tubular non porous pdms membrane silastic tubing cole parmer uk fixed at the central axis of a glass cylinder and is described in detail elsewhere zoumpouli et al 2018 membrane specifications are summarized in table 2 for single tube membrane ozonation experiments the gas flow rate through the contactor was set to 100 ml min 1 gas residence time of 30 s a flow split was used that by passed a portion of the inlet gas directly into the waste stream to simultaneously achieve low ozone concentrations and low gas flow rates entering the contactor experiments with different ozone concentrations in the feed gas were performed 25 to 197 g o3 m 3 both feed gas and feed water were supplied in single pass continuous mode the water flow rate was measured gravimetrically and set to 1 2 2 6 5 0 or 9 7 ml min 1 resulting in hydraulic retention times in the membrane reactor of 2 to 20 s see table s1 formation of few small gas bubbles was observed inside the membrane tube at water flow rates of 1 2 and 2 6 ml min 1 due to fast oxygen ozone transfer through the membrane the system was left to equilibrate for at least 10 min before samples were taken from a sampling port at the single tube contactor outlet the minimum time required to achieve stable ozone transfer conditions had been determined in previous experiments zoumpouli et al 2018 samples for dissolved ozone measurements were quenched with indigo see section 2 4 for details while samples for light absorbance and bromate measurements were not quenched but carefully filled from bottom to top with no headspace and stored in the dark at room temperature for several hours allowing for reactions to proceed until complete ozone depletion 2 3 2 multi tube membrane ozonation the second membrane ozonation module referred to as multi tube contactor fig 1 b was a custom made hollow fiber unit at half the size of commercial modules and provided by markel corp plymouth meeting pa usa the module consisted of a stainless steel housing containing 490 porous ptfe membrane fibers further details are listed in table 2 the module was installed vertically and operated in either co current or counter current flow with gas in the shell and liquid in the lumen gas was distributed within the module through a perforated tube located at the central axis of the module figure s1 for multi tube membrane ozonation experiments an oxygen flow rate into the ozone generator of 1000 ml min 1 was used resulting in a gas residence time in the membrane module of less than 1 min experiments with different ozone concentrations in the feed gas were performed at 25 to 71 g o3 m 3 the water flow rate was measured volumetrically and set to 400 680 or 920 ml min 1 resulting in hydraulic retention times of 26 to 60 s see table s2 at 400 ml min 1 the liquid side pressure was increased by partially closing the needle valve to avoid formation of gas bubbles while the pump provided sufficient pressure at higher flow rates see table s2 the system was left to equilibrate for at least 4 min to provide more than four times the hydraulic retention time in the module before samples were taken the experiments were performed in counter current flow for water and ozone gas at the lowest liquid side flow rate of 400 ml min 1 an additional setup with co current flow was implemented by inverting the gas flow direction samples were taken with the same procedure as described for single tube membrane ozonation 2 3 3 batch ozonation batch ozonation experiments were performed in 100 ml doc free glass flasks containing 70 ml of water sample with injection of an ozone stock solution the applied specific ozone doses were 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 6 1 0 and 1 5 mg o3 mg doc ozone for the batch experiments was produced from oxygen using a lab ozonizer 301 7 sander uetze elze germany water for the stock solution was of ultrapure grade and maintained at the sample temperature of 16 c during preparation ozone concentration in the stock solution was 21 1 mg l 1 as measured by uv absorption molar attenuation coefficient 3200 m 1 cm 1 at 260 nm von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the injection of ozone stock solution was done using a syringe extended with ptfe tubing to ensure submerged ozone dosing samples were stirred with a ptfe coated magnetic stirrer during ozone addition and for at least 20 s afterwards for complete mixing samples were stored at 16 c in the dark analysis took place on the subsequent day after filling up all water samples with ultrapure water to a volume of 100 ml the resulting dilution factor of the water 1 43 was multiplied with the analytical values for uv254 vis436 and bromate to allow comparison with the membrane ozonation results kinetic batch experiments were performed for specific ozone doses of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 mg o3 mg doc in a batch setup with a dispenser mounted on the flask from which samples were taken at regular time intervals ozone stock solution was added with a syringe via a side socket equipped with a septum and cannula stock solution addition took place below the reactor water level for about 20 s before sampling at regular defined time intervals commenced a lab dispenser was used for sampling for residual ozone measurements with indigo see section 2 4 for details stirring was discontinued 60 s after stock solution addition to prevent volatilization of ozone no significant loss of ozone in the reactor was found over the experimental duration of 20 min in tests using 20 mm h3po4 at ph 2 2 4 analytical techniques the concentration of dissolved residual ozone in the water outlet of each membrane contactor and in stock solution experiments was measured with the indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 all samples except for those for dissolved ozone toc and ph were filtered prior to analysis using 0 45 µm polypropylene syringe filters vwr international radnor us absorbance measurements at 254 and 436 nm and wavelength scans 190 700 nm 0 5 nm increment were performed with a hach lange dr 5000 spectrophotometer hach loveland usa using 5 cm quartz glass cuvettes all absorbance measurements were corrected by the absorbance of ultrapure water bromate concentrations were measured by ion chromatography ic with post column reaction and uv detection of triiodide iso 2011 a metrohm ic with an asupp16 column metrohm ag herisau switzerland was used bromide was measured by ion chromatography with uv detection using the same metrohm ic with an asupp5 column toc and doc were quantified as non purgeable organic carbon with the toc analyser toc l shimadzu corp kyoto japan using combustion catalytic oxidation at 680 c coupled with a nondispersive infrared sensor the ph of the feed water was measured with a fe20 ph meter mettler toledo leicester uk 2 5 ozone mass transfer calculations although small ozone concentration differences between inlet and outlet gas were detected for both membrane ozonation contactors it was not possible to accurately determine the transferred ozone dose from a gas side mass balance therefore uv254 reduction was used as a proxy for the ozone dose this approach was chosen because uv254 has been established as a surrogate parameter for oxidant exposure in ozonation processes e g for micropollutant degradation and bromate formation chon et al 2015 or to quantify the formation of biodegradable organic carbon during ozonation li et al 2017 specific ozone doses applied in membrane ozonation were approximated from the results of the batch experiments of which the ozone dose was known for calculations see si section s1 3 ozone decay in natural waters is usually modeled as a biphasic process consisting of an initial rapid ozone consumption phase and a slower secondary phase assuming first order exponential ozone decay elovitz et al 2000 westerhoff et al 1999 this secondary phase can be modeled using a first order ozone decay rate ko3 which was also used here to calculate ha of membrane ozonation eq 1 to obtain ko3 of membrane ozonation experiments an exponential fitting of ko3 after 15 s of reaction versus the ozone dose from kinetic batch experiments was used the fitting was calculated from the data of ozone doses of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 mg o3 mg doc table s7 figure s2 the fitting was performed in origin originlab northampton usa with an exponential function of the form y y0 a exp r0x where y is the ozone decay rate ko3 in s 1 and x is the ozone dose in mg o3 mg doc figure s3 fitting parameters are the offset y0 the initial value a and the rate r0 the results of the fitting were y0 0 0024 s 1 a 0 30 s 1 and r0 3 8 mg doc mg o3 using that function the first order ozone decay rate ko3 was estimated for each membrane ozonation experiment ha was calculated by using overall ozone decay rates ko3 determined at the contactor outlets accounting for the overall ozone dose that the water received the liquid side ozone mass transfer coefficient kl phattaranawik et al 2005 was calculated by eq 2 from the liquid side sherwood number shl the diffusion coefficient of ozone in water at 16 c do3 and the membrane inner diameter dm in the sherwood number was calculated based on the lévêque correlation lévêque 1928 and is explained in detail in the si section s1 4 the gas side and membrane mass transfer coefficients were calculated and presented in the si section s1 4 table s5 2 k l s h l d o 3 d m i n 3 results and discussion 3 1 ozone mass transfer in membrane ozonation the two membrane contactors used in this study obtained different membrane materials and module geometry table 2 however the experimental overall mass transfer coefficient was similar in both contactors table s5 the theoretical overall mass transfer coefficient in the multi tube contactor was higher than the experimental one which may be due to non ideal flow conditions within the module the experimental conditions for groundwater ozonation i e feed gas ozone concentrations and hydraulic retention times were chosen to achieve a similar range of residual dissolved ozone concentrations for both membrane contactors the range of residual dissolved ozone concentration at the contactor outlet was 0 0 6 4 mg l 1 for the single tube contactor fig 2 a and 0 0 7 2 mg l 1 for the multi tube contactor fig 2 b at the same dissolved ozone concentration the transferred ozone dose may be higher in the multi tube contactor due to increased hydraulic retention time and therefore increased ozone consumption within the module changing the flow mode to co current in the multi tube contactor decreased dissolved ozone concentrations slightly fig 2 b which was expected due to the decreasing concentration difference between gas and liquid side which is the driving force for mass transfer atchariyawut et al 2007 zero outlet concentrations of ozone were measured at ozone doses below 2 mg l 1 in both contactors figure s4 indicating rapid initial ozone consumption this is due to fast reactions of nom and other water matrix constituents and is referred to as the immediate ozone demand schmitt et al 2020 at ozone doses above the immediate ozone demand which applies for hydraulic retention times of 9 2 and 20 s in the single tube contactor and for all hydraulic retention times in the multi tube contactor dissolved ozone concentrations increased with both hydraulic retention time and ozone gas concentration in agreement with previous studies kaprara et al 2020 stylianou et al 2016 zoumpouli et al 2018 in fact a linear relationship between dissolved ozone in groundwater and ozone gas concentration was observed when exceeding the immediate ozone demand fig 2 figure s4 additional experiments with ultrapure water i e without an ozone sink with the multi tube contactor see figure s5 resulted in similar slopes as for the ozonation of groundwater e g for 60 s hydraulic retention time m 0 12 0 003 for groundwater and m 0 13 0 003 for ultrapure water however a concentration offset in groundwater ozonation was visible due to the immediate ozone demand and resulted in negative y intercepts 2 0 0 10 mg l 1 x0 1 1 0 13

multi tube contactor table s2 reaction conditions in the membrane ozonation contactors were compared based on the dimensionless hatta number ha fig 3 ha values of 0 31 1 72 in the moderately fast regime 0 3 ha 3 were obtained indicating that reactions took place both in the liquid film and in the bulk this is comparable to the membrane ozonation of nom isolates at ph 7 and 2 66 0 4 mg doc l 1 that resulted in ha of 0 52 0 82 leiknes et al 2005 zero outlet concentrations of dissolved ozone which were obtained by a combination of short hydraulic retention times and low feed gas ozone concentrations were correlated with ha 1 in the single tube contactor indicating the liquid film as the main reaction zone leiknes et al 2005 in multi tube ozonation a zero outlet ozone concentration was obtained at ha 1 67 only dissolved ozone concentrations of the multi tube contactor were slightly higher than in the single tube contactor at similar ha values according to eq 1 similar ha values imply lower ko3 and therefore higher ozone dose in the multi tube contactor than in the single tube contactor to make up for the lower kl of the multi tube contactor moreover in the multi tube contactor a transversal ozone concentration gradient on the gas side is established due to the distribution of ozone from a single central tube see figure s1 and methods section 2 3 for details this implies that membrane fibers near the center receive more ozone than those located further towards the outer wall of the contactor inner fibers might have received higher specific ozone doses resulting in depletion of fast reacting nom moieties and elevated overall residual ozone concentrations at the contactor outlet 3 2 transformation of groundwater nom in batch ozonation uv vis absorbance spectra for groundwater as absolute values are shown for batch experiments in fig 4 a and the inlet fig 4 b covering the visible light region that showed low absorbance nom typically exhibits an exponential decrease in absorption with increasing wavelength that can be modeled with the function a λ a λr exp s λ λr where a is the absorbance at wavelength λ λr is the reference wavelength and s is the spectral slope twardowski et al 2004 fig 4 c shows relative absorbance compared to the initial non ozonated sample absorbance generally decreased steadily with increasing ozone dose and to similar extent for wavelengths below 350 nm fig 4 c at wavelengths above 350 nm a smaller decrease or even small increases in absorbance for wavelengths above 375 nm were observed at lower ozone doses color i e absorbance at 436 nm was therefore increased at ozone doses below 0 4 mg o3 mg doc moreover at these ozone doses spectral slopes decreased figure s6 this is in contrast with previous findings of consistently increasing spectral slopes for nom isolates with increasing ozone doses including at low ozone doses wenk et al 2013 to further investigate this phenomenon liquid chromatography with subsequent organic carbon detection lc ocd analyses and additional ozonation experiments with pre filtered samples were conducted lc ocd chromatograms data from the additional experiments and a detailed explanation are given in the si section s2 2 figures s7 and s8 in short the humic substances organic carbon oc peak shifted to smaller retention times at low ozone doses indicating that high molecular nom with contribution to vis436 was released from colloidal nom fractions at ozonation pre microfiltration 0 1 or 0 45 µm of the samples reduced the increase in vis436 at low ozone doses which demonstrates that the nom compounds with contribution to vis436 originate from such colloidal nom fractions 3 3 color removal and bromate formation in membrane and batch ozonation despite the initial visible absorbance increase at low ozone doses which was similar across the three experimental setups both membrane and batch ozonation led to a significant decrease in vis436 from initially 0 5 m 1 to values under 0 2 m 1 at 1 5 mg o3 mg doc the highest ozone dose tested fig 5 a vis436 decrease at 1 0 mg o3 mg doc was 60 which was slightly lower than expected from previous studies on color removal in wastewater color measured at 455 nm wert et al 2009 and groundwater color measured at 408 nm rittmann et al 2002 both of which reported a color decrease of 80 at 1 0 mg o3 mg doc we attribute the lower decolorization efficacy in this groundwater sample to the initial increase of color at lower ozone doses see section 3 2 small variation in vis436 at comparable ozone dose i e at comparable uv254 reduction was observed in the different ozonation setups it is viable that the different ozone dosing mechanisms affected reaction conditions in the membrane contactors if a significant amount of ozone reacts within the liquid film i e at ha 1 leiknes et al 2005 ozone and hydroxyl radical exposure of water constituents may vary spatially in the liquid film ozone may be consumed quickly by fast reacting nom moieties jansen et al 2005 the hydroxyl radical exposure may not be affected by this as it depends on the consumed amount of ozone and not the ozone exposure kwon et al 2017 however as ha was in the moderately fast regime 0 3 ha 3 for membrane ozonation experiments in this study we believe that the effect of varied hydroxyl radical to ozone exposure ratios on uv254 and vis436 was minor and within the experimental error results for color removal for the single tube contactor were more scattered compared to the multi tube contactor and batch ozonation this is probably due to the larger variation of mass transfer conditions in the single tube contactor ratio of highest and lowest kl 2 0 ratio of highest and lowest ozone feed gas concentration 8 0 table s1 compared to the multi tube contactor ratio of highest and lowest kl 1 3 ratio of highest and lowest ozone feed gas concentration 2 8 table s2 which may have expanded the range of results and underlines an association between mass transfer conditions and final water quality bromate concentrations remained generally below the who guideline value of 10 µg l 1 for ozone doses below 0 5 mg o3 mg doc for all ozonation setups fig 5 b at higher ozone doses bromate formation increased drastically to concentrations of up to 103 µg l 1 resulting in a molar bromide to bromate conversion of up to 78 a similar relationship between bromate formation and ozone dose has been described previously for wastewater effluents and surface water li et al 2017 indicating that these results can also be translated into groundwater treatment at specific ozone doses below 0 5 mg o3 mg doc single tube ozonation resulted in lower or similar bromate formation compared to batch ozonation this was inverted at higher ozone doses which resulted in significantly higher bromate concentrations of single tube compared to batch ozonation similarly it was found in previous studies that bromate formation in membrane peroxone processes may either be lower or higher than in batch peroxone processes merle et al 2017 stylianou et al 2018b lower bromate formation in the membrane peroxone process than in batch ozonation was only found at ozone gas concentrations of 0 5 1 0 g o3 m 3 merle et al 2017 which is more than one order of magnitude lower than used in the study presented here in single tube ozonation a decrease in bromate concentration was observed with increasing hydraulic retention time i e with decreasing ozone gas concentration at comparable ozone dose fig 5 b clusters i and ii this is in agreement with the results of previous studies on membrane peroxone application merle et al 2017 stylianou et al 2018b and suggests that bromate control in nom rich groundwater may be achieved without addition of h2o2 multi tube membrane ozonation produced higher bromate concentrations than the other two setups tested despite longer hydraulic retention times and lower ozone gas concentrations than used in the single tube contactor the higher bromate formation in the multi tube contactor may be due to the uneven ozone distribution within the module we assume that bromate formation was higher in some membrane fibers due to elevated ozone dose which might have resulted in an increased bromate concentration of the final contactor effluent in the multi tube contactor only slight variation in bromate formation was observed which may be due to the small variation in experimental conditions see above figure s9 shows color vis436 versus bromate for all ozonation setups at comparable vis436 abatement bromate formation was in the order batch single tube contactor multi tube contactor indicating more selective vis436 reduction over bromate formation in batch and single tube ozonation at enhanced color removal i e vis436 0 3 m 1 bromate formation in the single tube contactor was higher than in batch ozonation these results are in accordance with the varying bromate formation in the different ozonation setups fig 5 b at bromate concentrations below 10 µg l 1 color removal of up to 45 for the single tube contactor and batch ozonation and 17 for the multi tube contactor could be achieved the color removal performance by ozonation in other groundwaters may be higher as the increase in color at low ozone doses shown here was not observed in the ozonation of other groundwaters rittmann et al 2002 sobhani et al 2012 fig 5 c shows ha for membrane ozonation as a function of specific ozone dose ha decreased with specific ozone dose because of decreasing ozone decay rate ko3 at constant specific ozone dose ha increased with increasing hydraulic retention time and therefore decreasing flow velocity zoumpouli et al 2018 clusters i and ii of fig 5 c highlight data points with comparable ozone dose and increase of ha with hydraulic retention time for these clusters bromate formation decreased for increasing hydraulic retention time and therefore higher ha as highlighted in fig 5 b ha indicates if the ozone concentration in the liquid film is controlled by mass transfer or reaction at increased ha mass transfer limitation and therefore competition between different reactants for ozone may increase beltrán 1995 it is plausible that high reaction rates of nom with ozone may decrease ozone exposure for compounds with slower ozone reaction kinetics and thereby decrease bromate formation at increased ha despite higher ha in the multi tube contactor than in the single tube contactor at comparable ozone dose fig 5 c bromate formation was higher in the multi tube contactor fig 5 b ha was calculated for the overall ozone dose charged to the multi tube contactor as the ozone dose is assumed to vary within the membrane fibers see above ha is also expected to vary this makes direct comparison to a single tube contactor less straightforward ha 1 i e faster reaction than mass transfer rate in the liquid film leiknes et al 2005 were obtained at specific ozone doses 0 5 mg o3 mg doc for both membrane contactors at these ozone doses bromate formation was similar in the single tube contactor compared to batch ozonation fig 5b at higher ozone dose bromate formation in the single tube contactor exceeded bromate formation in batch ozonation the application of ozone doses 0 5 mg o3 mg doc at a lower bromate formation than observed here might be feasible if the ozone gas concentration is further decreased and the hydraulic retention time is further increased the use of ha to indicate enhanced competition between nom degradation and bromate formation in membrane ozonation may help in experimental and contactor design to perform membrane ozonation under mass transfer limited conditions this knowledge may be applied to other treatment targets that aspire selective ozonation zero outlet ozone concentrations can serve as an indicator for high ha fig 3 membrane contactor design to achieve high ha would imply both large diameter and length as both decrease kl eq 2 eq s1 s4 as kl is usually the limiting factor for mass transfer in membrane ozonation pines et al 2005 this may increase the capital costs and footprint of membrane ozonation contactors on the other hand the pumping energy demand may be reduced at low flow velocities gottschalk et al 2010 large scale energy demand and cost assessments of membrane ozonation are required to fully assess the potential of membrane ozonation under different operating conditions bein et al 2020 to induce more uniform mass transfer conditions in multi tube hollow fiber modules ozone gas distribution should be optimized e g by increasing the distance between the tubes 4 conclusions color vis436 and ultraviolet light absorbance uv254 of a groundwater could be significantly reduced by ozonation however high bromide levels resulted in bromate concentrations beyond the who guideline value 10 µg l 1 for specific ozone doses 0 5 mg o3 mg doc at lower ozone doses high reaction rates of natural organic matter nom and ozone resulted in low dissolved ozone concentrations and controlled bromate formation in membrane ozonation conditions associated with a low mass transfer rate low ozone gas concentration long hydraulic retention time high hatta number ha showed lower bromate formation at comparable ozone dose than inverse conditions bromate formation in the single tube contactor was higher than in batch ozonation if specific ozone doses 0 5 mg o3 mg doc were applied with ha 1 at specific ozone doses 0 5 mg o3 mg doc bromate formation was comparable or lower in single tube ozonation compared to batch ozonation this was associated with ha 1 which implies mass transfer limitation of ozone in the membrane contactor longer hydraulic retention time and lower ozone gas concentrations may further depress bromate formation also at higher ozone doses as process settings with high ha were beneficial for increasing the selectivity of nom degradation over bromate formation further research is needed on large scale implementation of high ha membrane ozonation design for optimization of both water quality and treatment costs dissolved ozone concentration at the membrane ozonation contactor outlet might be a useful and simple parameter to assess ha of the process zero outlet concentrations of dissolved ozone were measured for ha 1 in single tube ozonation and ha 1 67 in multi tube ozonation uneven transversal ozone distribution inside a multi tube contactor appeared to increase bromate formation which was generally higher compared to single tube ozonation at comparable ozone dose and ha thus specific ozone dose and ha are not recommended as the only parameters to explain differences in water quality after treatment by different membrane contactors the identification of further parameters to quantify ozonation selectivity of target compound removal over by product formation in membrane contactors

15713,waste activated sludge was and greasy sludge gs discharged from the canned tuna industry are considerably characterized as harsh organic wastes to be individually treated by using traditional anaerobic digestion this study was attempted to anaerobically co digest was and gs in continuous pilot scale two stage process comprising the first 50 l continuous stir tank reactor cstr1 and the second 250 l continuous stir tank reactor cstr2 the two stage co digesting operation of dewatered was gs ratio of 0 4 1 g vs at ambient temperature with the organic loading rate olr of 12 6 0 75 g vs l d and 2 26 0 13 g vs l d corresponding to 3 day and 17 day hydraulic retention time hrt for the first and second stage respectively generated highest methane production rate of 957 86 ml ch4 l d corresponding to methane yield of 423 4 36 ml ch4 g vs organic removal efficiency obtained was around 67 5 on cod basis the microbial diversity was depended on the process s activity bacteria were mostly detected in the cstr1 dominating with the phylum firmicutes and proteobacteria whereas genus methanosaeta archaea were found dominantly in the cstr2 the economic analysis of process shows payback period pbp internal rate of return irr and net present value npv of 3 years 30 and 250 177 usd respectively this study demonstrated the potential approach to applying the two stage anaerobic co digestion process to stabilize both was and gs along with generating valuable bioenergy carriers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioenergy carrier two stage process anaerobic co digestion waste activated sludge greasy sludge 1 introduction the manufacturing of canned tuna requires a huge amount of water particularly for washing and cleaning a large volume of wastewater as high as 13 m3 ton of raw material is consequently discharged uttamangkabovorn et al 2005 the main compositions of tuna canning wastewater are lipids and proteins corresponding to chemical oxygen demand cod of 1600 mg l total suspended solids tss of 500 mg l and fat oil and grease fog of 250 mg l chowdhury et al 2010 an integrated treatment system for seafood processing wastewaters comprising of sedimentation dissolved air flotation daf and ph adjustment is often employed as primary treatment stage and followed by biological treatment via anaerobic and aerobic digesting process cristóvaõ et al 2015 the daf process could efficiently remove fog from the wastewater discharged from canned tuna processing collected daf slurry so called greasy sludge gs having high lipid contents and cod are subsequently treated by anaerobic digestion process meanwhile degreased wastewater and effluent from the anaerobic digestion process are simultaneously treated by aerobic activated sludge as process which could efficiently convert organic matters to waste activated sludge was the anaerobic digestion process allows for waste stabilization as well as the production of biogas which is promisingly renewable gaseous biofuel fonoll et al 2015 logan et al 2021 bio methane potential of lipids is theoretically higher than that of proteins and carbohydrates kobayashi et al 2012 however anaerobic digestion of lipids i e gs produces long chain fatty acids lcfas which could considerably cause methanogens inhibition biomass flotation in the reactor and long retention time creamer et al 2010 logan et al 2021 in addition adequate management of was is challenging due to the high cost involved leite et al 2016 although anaerobic digestion is a promising technology for organic waste treatment it has low efficiency for was because of limitations in hydrolyzing rate ge et al 2011 therefore was pretreatment to reduce toxicity and enhance biodegradation in subsequent anaerobic digestion process is essentially required several pretreatment methods of was have been studied including alkalinity thermal microwave and ultrasonic pretreatment abudi et al 2016 kuglarz et al 2013 xu et al 2014 these pretreatment methods could enhance was solubilization however application on industrial scale is not economically attractive due to still having high operating costs and energy input ye et al 2016 alternatively an interesting and economical solution to increase biodegradable and biogas production is anaerobic co digestion of two or more substrates together mata alvarez et al 2014 co digestion strategy has several advantages such as balance of nutrients dilution of toxic compounds and creation of synergistic effect for microorganisms resulting in high biogas production and biodegradation creamer et al 2010 several studies presented the superior digestion of co substrate when compared with the single substrate digestion jang et al 2015 jensen et al 2014 wu and song 2021 girault et al 2012 reported methane production from co digestion of was and gs was increased to 546 ml ch4 g vs which was higher than from mono digestion of was 264 ml ch4 g vs and gs 158 ml ch4 g vs however the stability of the single stage anaerobic co digestion process would become poor when a high organic loading rate olr was applied because rapid hydrolysis during the digestion could severely inhibit methanogens nghiem et al 2017 recently emerging two stage anaerobic digestion technology could considerably avert the imbalance between the processes of hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis caused by feeding high olr cremonez et al 2021 and efficiently improve substrate degradation and biogas conversion yan et al 2020 by separating hydrolysis acidogenesis from acetogenesis methanogenesis into two reactors with different conditions the two stage process provides high overall digestion efficiency and methane yield leite et al 2016 several studies have presented the advantages of two stage anaerobic digestion the two stage anaerobic digestion process for was treatment has also been widely tested leite et al 2016 watts et al 2006 wu et al 2016 however the investigation into the application of two stage anaerobic in co digestion of was and gs is rarely reported alqaralleh et al 2018 li et al 2015 according to alqaralleh et al 2018 and li et al 2015 the two stage anaerobic co digestion process could be feasibly and powerfully deployed on a commercial scale to treat was and gs which are generated from the same place in the wastewater treatment plant wwtp of the typical canned tuna industry however treatment performance and economic viability of such two stage process are still underrating study therefore pilot scale operation is essential to mimic the actual conditions to ensure that the results achieved are appropriate to further commercial up scaling this study was aimed at evaluating pilot scale two stage anaerobic process to co digest was and gs in terms of treatment efficiency and simultaneous enhancement for biodegradation and methane production three different types of was returned concentrated and dewatered sludge were used to co digest with gs in two continuous stir tank reactors cstr in series the various olrs were also proposed to evaluate the performance of the process different microbial communities in the first stage cstr1 and second stage cstr2 were also analyzed by the next generation method in addition the economic feasibility of two stage anaerobic co digestion of was and gs was later evaluated 2 material and methods 2 1 substrate and anaerobic sludge substrates was and gs and anaerobic sludge used in this investigation were taken from wwtp of songkla canning plc scc songkhla province thailand with a capacity of 3600 m3 d gs was collected from the daf process with discharged around 70 m3 gs d meanwhile there are three different forms of was as follows returned was rwas concentrated was cwas and dewatered was dwas which have considerably different water content table 1 rwas was discharged from secondary sediment tank cwas was discharged from the filter process fed with rwas whereas dwas obtained from the belt press fed with cwas thus the purpose of utilizing these was for co digestion with gs was to evaluate interchangeable use of rwas cwas and dwas for biogas production via the pilot scale two stage anaerobic co digestion process the trade off information between biogas production yield and expense for water removal from was is required by the scc the discharged flow rates m3 d of rwas cwas and dwas are around 66 26 and 5 respectively anaerobic sludge was originated from anaerobic digestion of gs in a 2000 m3 cstr digester operated at hrt of 20 days and at ambient temperature 2 2 pilot scale two stage anaerobic co digestion in continuous operation fig 1 shows the two stage anaerobic co digestion system for was and gs the system consisted of two cstrs of 50 l cstr1 for the first stage anaerobic co digestion and 250 l cstr2 for the second stage anaerobic co digestion one influent tank one effluent tank and one gas meter for the cstr1 and cstr2 the cstr1 was stirred by agitator while circulating system was used in cstr2 for mixing initially anaerobic digested sludge and mixed co substrate of was and gs were fed into cstr1 with various types of was rwas cwas and dwas the effluent from cstr1 was further used as a substrate for cstr2 to produce methane the temperature was uncontrolled mesophilic ambient temperature the temperature of the air surrounding the two stage system installed on site at wwtp of the scc which is around 28 37 c in both cstr1 and cstr2 the pilot scale two stage anaerobic process of co digestion of was and gs was operated for 201 days with five operating conditions as demonstrated in table 2 the ratio of rwas gs 0 5 1 vs basis was the optimum condition in a batch experiment of the co digestion of rwas gs in the two stage process sani et al 2022 the cwas gs ratio 2 4 1 vs basis was chosen to subsequently test the performance of the two stage process at higher olr and further high protein based mixed cwas and gs in addition the dwas gs ratio 0 4 1 vs basis was obtained from real proportional dwas and gs discharged from the wwtp of scc the pilot scale anaerobic co digestion of was and gs was installed at scc songkhla province thailand all substrates were taken from daily generation from the company gas production ph and volatile fatty acids vfas were measured daily from each reactor concentration of hydrogen methane and carbon dioxide were measured in cstr1 while concentration of methane and carbon dioxide were measured in cstr2 total solid ts volatile solid vs cod total vfas tvfa and alkalinity were monitored around 3 4 times per week 2 3 microbial community analysis anaerobic digestion sludge samples were taken during two stage anaerobic co digestion of dwas and gs at 3 day and 17 day hrt respectively for cstr1 and cstr2 the microbial communities were analyzed by the next generation sequencing ngs technology the ctab sds technique was used to extract total genomic dna from the samples on 1 agarose gels the concentration and purity of dna were measured dna was diluted to 1 ng l using sterile water according to the concentration the barcode was utilized to amplify 16s rrna 18s rrna its genes from separate locations phusion high fidelity pcr master mix was used in all pcr experiments new england biolabs quantification and qualifying of pcr products by mixing the same volume of 1x loading buffer containing syb green with the pcr products and electrophoresis on a 2 agarose gel for detection for the next experiments samples having a bright main strip between 400 and 450 bp were used qiagen gel extraction kit was used to purify the mixed pcr products qiagen germany the illumina platform would analyze the libraries created with the nebnext ultratm dna library prep kit for illumina and measured by qubit and q pcr 2 4 analytical method the ts vs ph cod total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and total ammonia were determined following the procedures described in the standard methods apha 1999 total lipid content was determined with a soxhlet extraction method while protein was followed method of girault et al 2012 carbohydrate was estimated from difference in the total vs and specific vs contribution of lipids and proteins the biogas volume was measured by gas meter the gas composition in biogas was determined by gas chromatography gc shimadzu gc 14a shimadzu corp kyoto japan equipment with thermal conductivity detector tcd and a 2 m stainless steel column packed with chin carbon 80 100 mesh a flow rate of 30 ml min of argon was used as a carrier gas with injection biogas injection temperature column temperature and detector temperature were 0 5 ml 100 100 and 100 c respectively the vfas concentration was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1200 equipped with animex hpx 87h 300 mm 7 8 mm column bio rad hercules ca and a refractive index ri detector with the following parameters column temperature of 65 c mobile phase of 5 mm sulfuric acid at 0 6 ml min and injection volume of 10 μl 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of substrates physical and chemical characteristics of gs and three types of was are shown in table 1 the wastewater from tuna canning processing was firstly removed oil and grease by using daf system in thickened sludge so called gs the gs reached an average of ts and vs of 34 10 0 20 g l and 29 00 0 30 g l respectively corresponding to 52 02 3 12 g l of cod the main component in gs was lipids carbohydrates and proteins with concentrations of 13 47 g l 9 13 g l and 6 40 g l respectively the high lipid content in gs could seriously cause inhibition in the anaerobic digestion system due to high lcfa accumulation creamer et al 2010 meanwhile three different forms of was were used in this investigation as follows rwas cwas and dwas which have considerably different water content table 1 rwas was obtained from the secondary sediment tank cwas was discharged from the filter process fed with rwas whereas dwas was obtained from the belt press fed with cwas ts contents of 6 53 0 06 g l 29 11 2 98 g l and 151 68 0 92 g l for rwas cwas and dwas were observed the ts concentration was increased during dewatering process in addition the protein was a major component achieved in was accounting to around 50 62 of vs whereas 19 37 of vs was contributed to carbohydrates and the rest of 9 19 of vs was lipid when ts content increased in rwas cwas and dwas the lipid content of the ts dropped from 18 9 ts to 9 6 ts but the carbohydrate content increased from 18 9 ts to 37 3 ts also protein content was decreased but insignificantly in cwas and dwas p 0 05 it could be because the volume in the liquid phase has reduced resulting in a change in the lipid protein and carbohydrate content of rwas cwas and dwas in addition the cod vs ratio was low in dwas compared with rwas and dwas it is because the liquid phase was removed resulting in a change in the percentage of carbohydrate protein and lipid leading to a lower cod vs ratio than in rwas and cwas high proteins found in was could lead to high ammonium accumulation which consequently inhibits microorganisms krakat et al 2017 therefore co digestion of was with gs could possibly dilute the inhibitor and enhance biogas production 3 2 performance of the two stage anaerobic digesters in series for co digestion of was and gs 3 2 1 the first acidogenic reactor fig 2 shows the performance of first stage anaerobic co digestion of was and gs at different hrt i rwas gs with 4 day hrt ii cwas gs with 4 day hrt iii dwas gs with 4 day hrt iv dwas gs with 3 day hrt v dwas gs 4 day hrt vi dwas gs 3 day hrt at 4 day hrt i iii the average biogas from co digestion of dwas gs iii was higher than that of rwas gs i and cwas gs ii the average biogas production rate of 115 4 20 6 ml biogas l d was achieved from co digestion of dwas gs while average biogas production rate of 5 40 0 6 ml biogas l d and 25 6 1 0 ml biogas l d was generated from co digestion of rwas gs and cwas gs respectively high biogas production rate is possible due to considerably high vs content in gs contributed to have olr in co digestion of dwas and gs 9 63 1 09 g vs l d which is higher than that of rwas and gs 2 69 0 19 g vs l d and cwas and gs 6 22 0 64 g vs l d meanwhile when decreasing hrt from 4 days to 3 days during anaerobic co digestion of dwas gs iii to iv the olr increased from 9 63 1 09 g vs l d to 12 7 0 84 g vs l d could increase average biogas production rate from 115 4 20 6 ml biogas l d to 228 0 35 8 ml biogas l d similar trend of biogas production was previously reported to be increased when increasing olr from 2 76 g vs l d to 11 1 g vs l d for anaerobic co digestion of was and food waste fw li et al 2017 in addition the cstr1 contained hydrogen concentration in the range of 1 3 and methane concentration in the range of 30 45 under slightly acidic phs 6 22 6 38 and rather low hrts 3 4 days in the acidogenic reactor cstr1 methanogens were evidently detected more details are stated in section 3 3 microbial community structure in the two stage anaerobic co digestion of was and gs consequently active methanogens could possibly convert acetic acid along with h2 co2 to considerable amount of methane zhang et al 2009 reported that some amount of methane was generated during the acidogenesis of was under acidic ph of 6 and 5 day hrt vfas produced during the first stage in cstr1 were demonstrated in fig 2b the concentration of tvfa was increased considerably when olr was increased the average tvfa concentrations were 0 95 0 1 g l 1 58 0 21 g l and 3 91 0 29 g l during 4 day hrt for anaerobic co digestion of rwas gs cwas gs and dwas gs respectively further decreasing hrt to 3 days for anaerobic co digestion of dwas gs considerable high average tvfa concentration of 4 5 271 g l was observed however the tvfa produced in this study was rather low compared to the previous study with a similar olr baldi et al 2019 reported tvfa of 8 2 g l produced from the first stage at 3 day hrt of the two stage anaerobic co digestion of was and fw at olr of 12 6 g vs l d and temperature of 37 c the tvfa produced was 1 82 times higher than that produced from this study this could be due to containing low carbohydrate content 19 cod based in mixed was and gs under 3 day hrt hydrolysis of carbohydrates to vfas plays the dominant role while protein and lipid degradation are still in lag phase yang et al 2015 lactic acid acetic acid propionic acid and butyric acid were detected respectively in a range of 15 65 42 87 mg l 244 2143 mg l 196 1026 mg l and 184 1044 mg l acetic acid was the major vfa detected the vfas accumulation could lower ph during the acidogenic stage during the first stage anaerobic co digestion in this investigation the uncontrolled initial ph was between 6 46 and 6 62 meanwhile the effluent ph was decreased to a range between 6 22 and 6 54 the ph in the reactor has been reported to be one of the factors to control the production of vfas during fermentation wang et al 2014 the optimal ph range for the production of vfas is generally wide range of 5 25 11 however the specific range is indeed dependent on the type of organic waste biomass used lee et al 2013 chen et al 2013 observed that optimal ph for vfas production from co fermentation of fw and was was ph 8 however wu et al 2016 reported that vfas accumulation during co fermentation of fw and excess sludge ph was capable of ph self maintaining at the beneficial range of 5 2 6 4 which is close to the ph range 6 22 6 54 found in the first stage of anaerobic co digestion was and gs in this investigation the alkalinity was monitored in the cstr1 as shown in fig 2c the average alkalinity was observed to be around 1 51 0 42 g caco3 l 1 65 0 57 g caco3 l and 2 75 0 14 g caco3 l during 4 day hrt for anaerobic co digestion of rwas gs cwas gs and dwas gs respectively in addition co digestion of dwas gs at htr 3 days was founded to be around 2 08 0 2 g l the alkalinity was decreased when increasing olr because more accumulation of tvfa could lead to decrease alkalinity the tvfa alkalinity ratio also showed increasing trend when increasing olr the highest tvfa alkalinity ratio of 2 27 was founded during the co digestion of dwas gs at hrt 3 days indeed anaerobic digester for methane production was recommended to control tvfa alkalinity ratio below 0 4 for process stability fonoll et al 2015 this stage was however focused on vfas production thus accumulation of vfas lead to reduce alkalinity and increase tvfa alkalinity ratio liu et al 2019 studied effects of the two stage operation on stability and efficiency in co digestion of fw and was and found total operating acidogenic stage at an olr range of 9 1 36 9 g vs l d tvfa alkalinity ratio range of 2 13 2 77 was achieved along with tvfa concentration in a range of 3 6 5 3 g l meanwhile baldi et al 2019 operated the first stage of acidogenesis for co digestion of fw and was at an olr of 14 6 g vs l d corresponding to obtained tvfa alkalinity ratio range between 1 07 and 1 26 which is partially agreed with the tvfa alkalinity ratio range 1 00 2 27 obtained from this investigation as previously mentioned the results achieved from the cstr1 are in accordance with the concept of two stage digestion in which the hydrolysis and acidogenesis step were occurred mainly in addition the cstr1 virtually functioned as the pre treatment step to enhancing the hydrolysis process and solubilization of was gs prior to feeding to the cstr2 the effluent from cstr1 was then further digested in cstr2 to generate methane based biogas 3 2 2 the second methanogenic reactor fig 3 shows the performance of the cstr2 during anaerobic digestion of the effluent from cstr1 to mainly produce methane based bio gas the effluent from cstr1 of rwas gs cwas gs and dwas gs digestion at 4 day hrt was further used as substrate in cstr2 with 20 day hrt corresponding to an olr range of 0 54 1 93 g vs l d i iii and v meanwhile the effluent from cstr1 of dwas gs digestion at 3 day hrt is further used as substrate in cstr2 with 15 and 17 day hrt corresponding to an olr range of 2 26 2 57 g vs l d iv and vi the average methane production rate was increased from 257 8 19 ml ch4 l d to 877 8 30 ml ch4 l d by increasing olr from 0 54 g vs l d to 1 93 g vs l d further increasing olr of to 2 57 g vs l d by feeding the effluent from cstr1 at 3 day hrt to the cstr2 at 15 day hrt foam formation was observed along with unstable biogas production the cstr2 was then shifted to be operated at increased hrt of 20 days by feeding with the effluent from cstr1 of dwas gs v using 4 day hrt stable methane production with an average methane production rate of 877 8 30 ml ch4 l d was achieved without any foam formation the cstr2 was further decreased hrt to 17 days by feeding with 3 day hrt effluent from cstr1 of gs dwas vi consequently the stable methane production was observed with an average rate of 957 0 86 ml ch4 l d foaming formation could be described with two following reasons 1 high protein content in loading protein is one of the surface active agents in anaerobic foaming proteins are less biodegradable than lipid and fiber accumulation of proteins at the air liquid interface could be facilitated during anaerobic digestion due to their surface active properties which could then lead to enhanced foaming potential 2 filamentous microorganisms gordonia species and m parvicella containing in was could cause foaming in anaerobic digestion the presentation of filamentous bacteria in the anaerobic digester s vapor liquid interface along with the potential for bio surfactant generation generally results in decreasing sludge surface tension and increasing foaming potential ganidi et al 2009 the cstr2 stability was analyzed through ph tvfa and alkalinity as shown in fig 3b c and table 2 the ph value of the effluent from the cstr1 which was fed to the cstr2 was in a range of 6 22 6 54 meanwhile the ph of effluent was increased to a range of 7 22 7 72 tvfa concentration was in range of 0 24 1 73 g l while alkalinity in range of 3 99 6 14 g caco3 l with tvfa alkalinity ratio of 0 06 0 30 was recorded these results indicate that the cstr2 had stable performance for anaerobic co digestion of was and gs however operating the cstr2 at the hrt of 15 days could result in high tvfa alkalinity ratio of 0 30 martín gonzález et al 2013 has recommended tvfa alkalinity ratio below 0 3 to achieve stable reactor performance table 2 shows the overall process performance of the two stage anaerobic digestion of gs and was the most suitable performance with the highest methane generation rate of 957 0 86 ml ch4 l d corresponding to a methane yield of 423 4 36 ml ch4 g vs was achieved by the two stage anaerobic co digestion of dwas gs from the cstr1 and the cstr2 operated at hrt of 3 days and 17 days respectively the stability of the process in terms of tvfa alkalinity ratio was 0 21 furthermore vs and cod removal one of the key parameters to guarantee the two stage stage anaerobic co digestion process of was and gs for treatment of tuna canning wastewater and recovery of methane gas the vs and cod removal in cstr1 were 55 6 and 67 5 respectively with the vs removal calculated by measuring influent and effluent vs while cod removal is calculated by hydrogen and methane production similar methane production rate of 1070 ml ch4 l d was achieved from the two stage anaerobic co digestion of was and fw two cstrs in series operated at 37 c and at 3 day hrt olr 12 6 g vs l d and 12 day hrt olr 2 5 g vs l d for the first and second stage respectively baldi et al 2019 in addition the protein destruction during anaerobic co digestion of was and gs in the pilot scale two stage process experimental results including methane production rate acids concentration and organic matter concentrations cod vs and ts were incorporated to simulate the modified adm 1 model implemented in gps x software simulated results of the two stage co digestion of dwas and gs at 3 day and 17 day hrt for cstr1 and cstr2 respectively provided hydrolysis constant of protein of 2 5 d 1and protein destruction rate of 0 57 g cod l d accounting to overall protein destruction of 69 manuscript in preparation mass balance in the two stage anaerobic co digestion system was performed in cod term by using experimental results achieved from co digestion of different was types rwas cwas dwas and gs at 4 days for cstr1 and 20 days for cstr2 as shown in table 3 the cod of vfas in the cstr1 supposedly derived from carbohydrates is around 5 10 of total influent cod the other product component in the cstr1 accounting to around 91 95 of total influent cod could probably be lcfa amino acids non hydrolyzed lipid protein carbohydrates and cell mass meanwhile effluent cod from cstr1 was majorly converted to methane in the cstr2 operated at 20 day hrt in a range between 70 72 methane production obtained from mixed rwas gs and mixed cwas gs is insignificantly different p 0 05 meanwhile mixed dwas gs at rather high olr is significantly different p 0 05 compared to methane production from either mixed rwas gs or mixed cwas gs the other component product that remained in the cstr2 accounting to around 25 4 29 9 which could properly be difficult biodegradable compounds in both soluble and suspended form the cod balance reveals that total cod influent could be removed from the two stage anaerobic system only in h2 and ch4 form furthermore satisfactory methane yields were obtained from various mixing ratios of was and gs indicating that the pilot scale two stage anaerobic co digestion process established in this investigation could be interchangeably operated at various mixing ratios of was and gs 3 3 microbial community structure in the two stage anaerobic co digestion of was and gs relative abundance of the microbial community kingdom a bacteria at the phylum level b and archaea at the genus level c described microbial community in the cstr1 and cstr2 are demonstrated in fig 4 the relative abundance of bacteria in the cstr1 higher than that in the cstr2 are in accordance with bacterial activity in cstr1 which is relied on hydrolysis and acidogenesis step the bacteria accounted for 91 38 and 50 10 in the cstr1 and the cstr2 respectively bacterial sequences obtained from cstr1 indicate dominant phyla in bacterial community of firmicutes 48 56 proteobacteria 24 52 bacteroidetes 5 65 and chloroflexi 4 11 meanwhile the main bacterial community phyla in cstr2 were dominated with firmicutes 34 06 proteobacteria 35 28 bacteroidetes 9 73 and chloroflexi 4 47 firmicuter and bacteroidetes are important microorganisms for degrading saccharides and protein as well as enriching at a rapid multiplication rate in growth environment where soluble organic matter is high concentration garcia peña et al 2011 in addition firmicutes as fermentative and syntrophic bacteria could also biodegrade vfas such as butyrate kabisch et al 2014 whereas proteobacteria and chloroflexi are also important bacteria hydrolysis and acidification in the anaerobic digestion system dai et al 2016 the relative abundances of archaea communities are also shown in fig 4 a c it can be seen that archaea in the cstr2 were more dominant than that in the cstr1 the main genus of archaea was methanosaseata accounting for 97 39 and 99 57 in cstr1 and cstr2 respectively the methanosaseata is acetoclastic methanogens utilizing acetate as a substrate for methane production dai et al 2016 in addition methanobacterium methanolinea and methanosarcina were also rarely detected 1 the type and nature of the microbial community that present in the reactor environment impacts how well a two stage anaerobic digester performs and seed organisms or inoculum type have a huge impact on reactor dynamics rajendran et al 2020 from this study the anaerobic digestion was separated into two reactors and operated under different conditions resulting in changes in microbial community dynamics the cstr1 was operated under high olr 12 7 g vs l d and short hrt 3 days leading to have bacteria dominance in the first stage 90 while archaea existing in the cstr2 was contributed from operating under low olr 2 3 g vs l d and long hrt 17 days these observations are in line with the concept of two stage anaerobic digestion in which the first stage anaerobic bacteria enhance rich organic acids hydrolysate from harsh substrate for further feeding to producing methane based biogas by methanogenic archaea the firmicutes phylum having significant dominance 48 in the cstr1 is capable of converting diverse carbon substrates to vfas especially acetate thus this vfas based cstr1 effluent is the most attractive carbon source for acetoclastic methanogenesis in the cstr2 meanwhile effective metabolisms in the cstr2 were achieved mostly by 99 dominant methanosaeta and major bacteria i e firmicutes proteobacteria responsible for hydrolysis and acetogenesis of undigested organic matters discharged from the cstr1 thus employing two stage anaerobic digester is capable of splitting the consortia and providing optimum conditions for each targeted group 3 4 economy analysis according to the experimental results the pilot scale two stage anaerobic co digestion process of dwas gs provided biogas production rate of 1 59 l biogas l d with methane content in a range between 62 and 66 under operating conditions of total 20 day hrt 3 days for cstr1 and 17 days for cstr2 corresponding to olr 2 26 g vs l d meanwhile the single stage anaerobic digestion of gs in commercial scale of scc songkla province thailand with 20 day hrt olr of 2 2 g vs l d at ambient temperature could produce 0 56 l biogas l d having methane content in a range between 45 and 55 this could be implied that the pilot two stage anaerobic co digestion process of was and gs is practical feasibility to enhance biodegradability and biogas production simultaneously however economic feasibility is another important factor for final decisions to up scale this two stage process thus economic terms including net present value npv payback period pbp and internal rate of return irr were used to evaluate the economic feasibility of the pilot scale two stage anaerobic co digestion process couple with absorption process for further h2s and co2 removal by water absorbent rattanaya et al 2022 fig 5 shows cod and mass balance and the scenario used to analyze economic feasibility of the two stage anaerobic co digestion process of dwas and gs influent composition used for mass balance was obtained from run vi operating conditions dwas and gs discharged from the scc were simultaneously pumped with real flow rates of 5 m3 d and 70 m3 d respectively to 321 m3 digester having working volume 225 m3 with 3 day hrt for cstr1 and further transferred to 1821 m3 digester having working volume of 1275 m3 with 17 day hrt for the cstr2 according to the previously experimental result obtained from the most suitable operating conditions biogas production rate of 1793 m3 d was expected with 70 methane content in biogas water scrubber was chosen for biogas upgrading with 95 co2 removal efficacy misrol et al 2019 the capital expenditure and operating expenditure capex and opex of the system was estimated for biogas digester and biogas upgrading technology according to abas et al 2013 and lim et al 2021 the capex for cstr technology is 422 4 usd m3 digseter base on year 2018 while biogas upgrading technology is 87 000 usd for 452 m3 hr raw biogas base on year 2019 misrol et al 2019 hence the cost escalation method is used to forecast the future cost as shown in eq 1 1 c r c p c e p c i c r c e p c i c p where c r is the inflation adjusted cost in current year c p is the inflation adjusted cost in previous year c e p c i c r is the cost index for chemical engineering plant in current year c e p c i c p is the cost index for chemical engineering plant in previous year the chemical engineering plant cost index cepci was used for calculation of cost of product in current year the cepci base on year 2009 2018 and 2021 are 521 9 603 1 and 754 7 correlation factor for economies of scale n was used for estimated the cost in case of different scale from the previous as showed in eq 2 the traditional index of 0 6 vo et al 2018 was used as a n for economy of scale sizing exponent 2 n e w c o s t o r i g i n a l c o s t n e w s i z e o r i g i n a l s i z e n the the opex was consisted of fixed and variable operating costs and estimated at 2 of capex for anaerobic digestion unit abas et al 2013 the biogas upgrading unit s opex was estimated to be 3 of capex and 0 275 kwh m3 biogas of electricity misrol et al 2019 the npv irr and pbp are used as valuation criteria to analyze the profitability of the system the npv is the total present value of net income and the system is profitable when npv is more than zero eq 3 is given as a formula for determine npv 3 n p v n 1 n t z n 1 i n c a p e x where z n is the net cash flow and i is the interest rate 15 and z n can be calculated by eq 4 4 z n r e v e n u e o p e x where r e v e n u e is the methane production in the process where 0 3 usd m3 methane misrol et al 2019 while pbp refers to the amount of time it takes to recover the capital investment cost which is one parameter of economic profitability the pbp was calculated based on capex value and z n as a shown in eq 5 5 p b p c a p e x z n the internal rate of return irr is an investment appraisal measurement used to evaluate profitability investments of system in general the higher an irr makes the project more attractive the investment the irr calculations use the same formula as npv calculation by giving the

were respectively achieved revenue of proposed system reached 119 592 usd year with net cash flow of 83 069 usd year the economic estimation was based on project life of 20 years and the 15 discount rate the value of npv pbp and irr 250 177 usd 3 years and 30 respectively the economic feasibility of this case shows a high npv values which is greater economic benefit and pbp shows good economic situation this result shows two stage anaerobic co digestion process of dwas and gs is economically feasible to be established in full scale plant furthermore burning biogas as a heat source could lower greenhouse gas ghg emissions ghgs such as methane and carbon dioxide have negative global and climate impacts thus the combustion of biogas for heating e g boiler electricity generation cooking is increasingly vital in reducing ghg emissions in this scenario the greenhouse gas production co2 was 781 tons year 1 96 kg co2 m3 biogas akbulut 2012 if the system was occurred for flaring then the ghg emission was produced 5444 tons year 9 2 kg co2 m3 biogas akbulut 2012 by comparing the capex per methane revenue with previous studies analyzed for different systems and feedstock vo et al 2018 studied economic analysis of co digestion of grass silage and manure in two series cstr with biogas upgrading by amine scrubber the capex per methane revenue was 1 82 usd m3 methane year another report from mahmod et al 2021 evaluated economic feasibility of two stage anaerobic digestion of palm mill effluent and reported 0 01 usd m3 methane year the capex per methane revenue of this study 0 63 usd m3 methane year is therefore fitted within the range of previous study currently several pretreatment methods of was have been studied including alkalinity thermal microwave and ultrasonic pretreatment abudi et al 2016 kuglarz et al 2013 xu et al 2014 these pretreatment methods could technically enhance the solubilization of the was cost and energy input at an industrial scale were considerably high ye et al 2016 dhar et al 2012 reported pretreatment costs for thermal and ultrasonic pretreatment of 62 and 196 usd ton sludge respectively meanwhile cho et al 2014 reported capital investment in alkaline mechanical pretreatment of was to enhancing anaerobic digestion of 278 usd m3 thickened was d while operating cost of 14 usd m3 thickened was d with 6 71 years for payback and achieved 55 vs destruction this shows 8 3 cost investment from this study to invest alkaline mechanical pre treatment of was before single stage anaerobic digestion rajendran et al 2020 was reported cost investment of two stage process over single stage process 3 therefore two stage anaerobic co digestion pretreatment of was and gs is more economically feasible according to technical data obtained from the pilot scale experiment 4 conclusion the two stage anaerobic co digestion dwas gs showed considerably high methane production rate comparing to that of rwas gs and cwas gs the highest methane production rate of 957 ml ch4 l d corresponding to methane yield of 423 ml ch4 g vs was achieved at 3 and 17 day hrt in cstr1 and cstr2 with enrichment of phylum firmicuters and bacteroidetes and genus methanosaseata economic analysis reveals feasibility for further establishment of full scale two stage anaerobic process for co digestion of was and gs with pbp 3 years and irr 30 according

15713,waste activated sludge was and greasy sludge gs discharged from the canned tuna industry are considerably characterized as harsh organic wastes to be individually treated by using traditional anaerobic digestion this study was attempted to anaerobically co digest was and gs in continuous pilot scale two stage process comprising the first 50 l continuous stir tank reactor cstr1 and the second 250 l continuous stir tank reactor cstr2 the two stage co digesting operation of dewatered was gs ratio of 0 4 1 g vs at ambient temperature with the organic loading rate olr of 12 6 0 75 g vs l d and 2 26 0 13 g vs l d corresponding to 3 day and 17 day hydraulic retention time hrt for the first and second stage respectively generated highest methane production rate of 957 86 ml ch4 l d corresponding to methane yield of 423 4 36 ml ch4 g vs organic removal efficiency obtained was around 67 5 on cod basis the microbial diversity was depended on the process s activity bacteria were mostly detected in the cstr1 dominating with the phylum firmicutes and proteobacteria whereas genus methanosaeta archaea were found dominantly in the cstr2 the economic analysis of process shows payback period pbp internal rate of return irr and net present value npv of 3 years 30 and 250 177 usd respectively this study demonstrated the potential approach to applying the two stage anaerobic co digestion process to stabilize both was and gs along with generating valuable bioenergy carriers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioenergy carrier two stage process anaerobic co digestion waste activated sludge greasy sludge 1 introduction the manufacturing of canned tuna requires a huge amount of water particularly for washing and cleaning a large volume of wastewater as high as 13 m3 ton of raw material is consequently discharged uttamangkabovorn et al 2005 the main compositions of tuna canning wastewater are lipids and proteins corresponding to chemical oxygen demand cod of 1600 mg l total suspended solids tss of 500 mg l and fat oil and grease fog of 250 mg l chowdhury et al 2010 an integrated treatment system for seafood processing wastewaters comprising of sedimentation dissolved air flotation daf and ph adjustment is often employed as primary treatment stage and followed by biological treatment via anaerobic and aerobic digesting process cristóvaõ et al 2015 the daf process could efficiently remove fog from the wastewater discharged from canned tuna processing collected daf slurry so called greasy sludge gs having high lipid contents and cod are subsequently treated by anaerobic digestion process meanwhile degreased wastewater and effluent from the anaerobic digestion process are simultaneously treated by aerobic activated sludge as process which could efficiently convert organic matters to waste activated sludge was the anaerobic digestion process allows for waste stabilization as well as the production of biogas which is promisingly renewable gaseous biofuel fonoll et al 2015 logan et al 2021 bio methane potential of lipids is theoretically higher than that of proteins and carbohydrates kobayashi et al 2012 however anaerobic digestion of lipids i e gs produces long chain fatty acids lcfas which could considerably cause methanogens inhibition biomass flotation in the reactor and long retention time creamer et al 2010 logan et al 2021 in addition adequate management of was is challenging due to the high cost involved leite et al 2016 although anaerobic digestion is a promising technology for organic waste treatment it has low efficiency for was because of limitations in hydrolyzing rate ge et al 2011 therefore was pretreatment to reduce toxicity and enhance biodegradation in subsequent anaerobic digestion process is essentially required several pretreatment methods of was have been studied including alkalinity thermal microwave and ultrasonic pretreatment abudi et al 2016 kuglarz et al 2013 xu et al 2014 these pretreatment methods could enhance was solubilization however application on industrial scale is not economically attractive due to still having high operating costs and energy input ye et al 2016 alternatively an interesting and economical solution to increase biodegradable and biogas production is anaerobic co digestion of two or more substrates together mata alvarez et al 2014 co digestion strategy has several advantages such as balance of nutrients dilution of toxic compounds and creation of synergistic effect for microorganisms resulting in high biogas production and biodegradation creamer et al 2010 several studies presented the superior digestion of co substrate when compared with the single substrate digestion jang et al 2015 jensen et al 2014 wu and song 2021 girault et al 2012 reported methane production from co digestion of was and gs was increased to 546 ml ch4 g vs which was higher than from mono digestion of was 264 ml ch4 g vs and gs 158 ml ch4 g vs however the stability of the single stage anaerobic co digestion process would become poor when a high organic loading rate olr was applied because rapid hydrolysis during the digestion could severely inhibit methanogens nghiem et al 2017 recently emerging two stage anaerobic digestion technology could considerably avert the imbalance between the processes of hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis caused by feeding high olr cremonez et al 2021 and efficiently improve substrate degradation and biogas conversion yan et al 2020 by separating hydrolysis acidogenesis from acetogenesis methanogenesis into two reactors with different conditions the two stage process provides high overall digestion efficiency and methane yield leite et al 2016 several studies have presented the advantages of two stage anaerobic digestion the two stage anaerobic digestion process for was treatment has also been widely tested leite et al 2016 watts et al 2006 wu et al 2016 however the investigation into the application of two stage anaerobic in co digestion of was and gs is rarely reported alqaralleh et al 2018 li et al 2015 according to alqaralleh et al 2018 and li et al 2015 the two stage anaerobic co digestion process could be feasibly and powerfully deployed on a commercial scale to treat was and gs which are generated from the same place in the wastewater treatment plant wwtp of the typical canned tuna industry however treatment performance and economic viability of such two stage process are still underrating study therefore pilot scale operation is essential to mimic the actual conditions to ensure that the results achieved are appropriate to further commercial up scaling this study was aimed at evaluating pilot scale two stage anaerobic process to co digest was and gs in terms of treatment efficiency and simultaneous enhancement for biodegradation and methane production three different types of was returned concentrated and dewatered sludge were used to co digest with gs in two continuous stir tank reactors cstr in series the various olrs were also proposed to evaluate the performance of the process different microbial communities in the first stage cstr1 and second stage cstr2 were also analyzed by the next generation method in addition the economic feasibility of two stage anaerobic co digestion of was and gs was later evaluated 2 material and methods 2 1 substrate and anaerobic sludge substrates was and gs and anaerobic sludge used in this investigation were taken from wwtp of songkla canning plc scc songkhla province thailand with a capacity of 3600 m3 d gs was collected from the daf process with discharged around 70 m3 gs d meanwhile there are three different forms of was as follows returned was rwas concentrated was cwas and dewatered was dwas which have considerably different water content table 1 rwas was discharged from secondary sediment tank cwas was discharged from the filter process fed with rwas whereas dwas obtained from the belt press fed with cwas thus the purpose of utilizing these was for co digestion with gs was to evaluate interchangeable use of rwas cwas and dwas for biogas production via the pilot scale two stage anaerobic co digestion process the trade off information between biogas production yield and expense for water removal from was is required by the scc the discharged flow rates m3 d of rwas cwas and dwas are around 66 26 and 5 respectively anaerobic sludge was originated from anaerobic digestion of gs in a 2000 m3 cstr digester operated at hrt of 20 days and at ambient temperature 2 2 pilot scale two stage anaerobic co digestion in continuous operation fig 1 shows the two stage anaerobic co digestion system for was and gs the system consisted of two cstrs of 50 l cstr1 for the first stage anaerobic co digestion and 250 l cstr2 for the second stage anaerobic co digestion one influent tank one effluent tank and one gas meter for the cstr1 and cstr2 the cstr1 was stirred by agitator while circulating system was used in cstr2 for mixing initially anaerobic digested sludge and mixed co substrate of was and gs were fed into cstr1 with various types of was rwas cwas and dwas the effluent from cstr1 was further used as a substrate for cstr2 to produce methane the temperature was uncontrolled mesophilic ambient temperature the temperature of the air surrounding the two stage system installed on site at wwtp of the scc which is around 28 37 c in both cstr1 and cstr2 the pilot scale two stage anaerobic process of co digestion of was and gs was operated for 201 days with five operating conditions as demonstrated in table 2 the ratio of rwas gs 0 5 1 vs basis was the optimum condition in a batch experiment of the co digestion of rwas gs in the two stage process sani et al 2022 the cwas gs ratio 2 4 1 vs basis was chosen to subsequently test the performance of the two stage process at higher olr and further high protein based mixed cwas and gs in addition the dwas gs ratio 0 4 1 vs basis was obtained from real proportional dwas and gs discharged from the wwtp of scc the pilot scale anaerobic co digestion of was and gs was installed at scc songkhla province thailand all substrates were taken from daily generation from the company gas production ph and volatile fatty acids vfas were measured daily from each reactor concentration of hydrogen methane and carbon dioxide were measured in cstr1 while concentration of methane and carbon dioxide were measured in cstr2 total solid ts volatile solid vs cod total vfas tvfa and alkalinity were monitored around 3 4 times per week 2 3 microbial community analysis anaerobic digestion sludge samples were taken during two stage anaerobic co digestion of dwas and gs at 3 day and 17 day hrt respectively for cstr1 and cstr2 the microbial communities were analyzed by the next generation sequencing ngs technology the ctab sds technique was used to extract total genomic dna from the samples on 1 agarose gels the concentration and purity of dna were measured dna was diluted to 1 ng l using sterile water according to the concentration the barcode was utilized to amplify 16s

prep kit for illumina and measured by qubit and q pcr 2 4 analytical method the ts vs ph cod total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and total ammonia were determined following the procedures described in the standard methods apha 1999 total lipid content was determined with a soxhlet extraction method while protein was followed method of girault et al 2012 carbohydrate was estimated from difference in the total vs and specific vs contribution of lipids and proteins the biogas volume was measured by gas meter the gas composition in biogas was determined by gas chromatography gc shimadzu gc 14a shimadzu corp kyoto japan equipment with thermal conductivity detector tcd and a 2 m stainless steel column packed with chin carbon 80 100 mesh a flow rate of 30 ml min of argon was used as a carrier gas with injection biogas injection temperature column temperature and detector temperature were 0 5 ml 100 100 and 100 c respectively the vfas concentration was analyzed by high performance liquid

mobile phase of 5 mm sulfuric acid at 0 6 ml min and injection volume of 10 μl 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of substrates physical and chemical characteristics of gs and three types of was are shown in table 1 the wastewater from tuna canning processing was firstly removed oil and grease by using daf system in thickened sludge so called gs the gs reached an average of ts and vs of 34 10 0 20 g l and 29 00 0 30 g l respectively corresponding to 52 02 3 12 g l of cod the main component in gs was lipids carbohydrates and proteins with concentrations of 13 47 g l 9 13 g l and 6 40 g l respectively the high lipid content in gs could seriously cause inhibition in the anaerobic digestion system due to high lcfa accumulation creamer et al 2010 meanwhile three different forms of was were used in this investigation as follows rwas cwas and dwas which have considerably different water content table 1 rwas was obtained from the secondary sediment tank cwas was discharged from the filter process fed with rwas whereas dwas was obtained from the belt press fed with cwas ts contents of 6 53 0 06 g l 29 11 2 98 g l and 151 68 0 92 g l for rwas cwas and dwas were observed the ts concentration was increased during dewatering process in addition the protein was a major component achieved in was accounting to around 50 62 of vs whereas 19 37 of vs was contributed to carbohydrates and the rest of 9 19 of vs was lipid when ts content increased in rwas cwas and dwas the lipid content of the ts dropped from 18 9 ts to 9 6 ts but the carbohydrate content increased from 18 9 ts to 37 3 ts also protein content was decreased but insignificantly in cwas and dwas p 0 05 it could be because the volume in the liquid phase has reduced resulting in a change in the lipid protein and carbohydrate content of rwas cwas and dwas in addition the cod vs ratio was low in dwas compared with rwas and dwas it is because the liquid phase was removed resulting in a change in the percentage of carbohydrate protein and lipid leading to a lower cod vs ratio than in rwas and cwas high proteins found in was could lead to high ammonium accumulation which consequently inhibits microorganisms krakat et al 2017 therefore co digestion of was with gs could possibly dilute the inhibitor and enhance biogas production 3 2 performance of the two stage anaerobic digesters in series for co digestion of was and gs 3 2 1 the first acidogenic reactor fig 2 shows the performance of first stage anaerobic co digestion of was and gs at different hrt i rwas gs with 4 day hrt ii cwas gs with 4 day hrt iii dwas gs with 4 day hrt iv dwas gs with 3 day hrt v dwas gs 4 day hrt vi dwas gs 3 day hrt at 4 day hrt i iii the average biogas from co digestion of dwas gs iii was higher than that of rwas gs i and cwas gs ii the average biogas production rate of 115 4 20 6 ml biogas l d was achieved from co digestion of dwas gs while average biogas production rate of 5 40 0 6 ml biogas l d and 25 6 1 0 ml biogas l d was generated from co digestion of rwas gs and cwas gs respectively high biogas production rate is possible due to considerably high vs content in gs contributed to have olr in co digestion of dwas and gs 9 63 1 09 g vs l d which is higher than that of rwas and gs 2 69 0 19 g vs l d and cwas and gs 6 22 0 64 g vs l d meanwhile when decreasing hrt from 4 days to 3 days during anaerobic co digestion of dwas gs iii to iv the olr increased from 9 63 1 09 g vs l d to 12 7 0 84 g vs l d could increase average biogas production rate from 115 4 20 6 ml biogas l d to 228 0 35 8 ml biogas l d similar trend of biogas production was previously reported to be increased when increasing olr from 2 76 g vs l d to 11 1 g vs l d for anaerobic co digestion of was and food waste fw li et al 2017 in addition the cstr1 contained hydrogen concentration in the range of 1 3 and methane concentration in the range of 30 45 under slightly acidic phs 6 22 6 38 and rather low hrts 3 4 days in the acidogenic reactor cstr1 methanogens were evidently detected more details are stated in section 3 3 microbial community structure in the two stage anaerobic co digestion of was and gs consequently active methanogens could possibly convert acetic acid along with h2 co2 to considerable amount of methane zhang et al 2009 reported that some amount of methane was generated during the acidogenesis of was under acidic ph of 6 and 5 day hrt vfas produced during the first stage in cstr1 were demonstrated in fig 2b the concentration of tvfa was increased considerably when olr was increased the average tvfa concentrations were 0 95 0 1 g l 1 58 0 21 g l and 3 91 0 29 g l during 4 day hrt for anaerobic co digestion of rwas gs cwas gs and dwas gs respectively further decreasing hrt to 3 days for anaerobic co digestion of dwas gs considerable high average tvfa concentration of 4 5 271 g l was observed however the tvfa produced in this study was rather low compared to the previous study with a similar olr baldi et al 2019 reported tvfa of 8 2 g l produced from the first stage at 3 day hrt of the two stage anaerobic co digestion of was and fw at olr of 12 6 g vs l d and temperature of 37 c the tvfa produced was 1 82 times higher than that produced from this study this could be due to containing low carbohydrate content 19 cod based in mixed was and gs under 3 day hrt hydrolysis of carbohydrates to vfas plays the dominant role while protein and lipid degradation are still in lag phase yang et al 2015 lactic acid acetic acid propionic acid and butyric acid were detected respectively in a range of 15 65 42 87 mg l 244 2143 mg l 196 1026 mg l and 184 1044 mg l acetic acid was the major vfa detected the vfas accumulation could lower ph during the acidogenic stage during the first stage anaerobic co digestion in this investigation the uncontrolled initial ph was between 6 46 and 6 62 meanwhile the effluent ph was decreased to a range between 6 22 and 6 54 the ph in the reactor has been reported to be one of the factors to control the production of vfas during fermentation wang et al 2014 the optimal ph range for the production of vfas is generally wide range of 5 25 11 however the specific range is indeed dependent on the type of organic waste biomass used lee et al 2013 chen et al 2013 observed that optimal ph for vfas production from co fermentation of fw and was was ph 8 however wu et al 2016 reported that vfas accumulation during co fermentation of fw and excess sludge ph was capable of ph self maintaining at the beneficial range of 5 2 6 4 which is close to the ph range 6 22 6 54 found in the first stage of anaerobic co digestion was and gs in this investigation the alkalinity was monitored in the cstr1 as shown in fig 2c the average alkalinity was observed to be around 1 51 0 42 g caco3 l 1 65 0 57 g caco3 l and 2 75 0 14 g caco3 l during 4 day hrt for anaerobic co digestion of rwas gs cwas gs and dwas gs respectively in addition co digestion of dwas gs at htr 3 days was founded to be around 2 08 0 2 g l the alkalinity was decreased when increasing olr because more accumulation of tvfa could lead to decrease alkalinity the tvfa alkalinity ratio also showed increasing trend when increasing olr the highest tvfa alkalinity ratio of 2 27 was founded during the co digestion of dwas gs at hrt 3 days indeed anaerobic digester for methane production was recommended to control tvfa alkalinity ratio below 0 4 for process stability fonoll et al 2015 this stage was however focused on vfas production thus accumulation of vfas lead to reduce alkalinity and increase tvfa alkalinity ratio liu et al 2019 studied effects of the two stage operation on stability and efficiency in co digestion of fw and was and found total operating acidogenic stage at an olr range of 9 1 36 9 g vs l d tvfa alkalinity ratio range of 2 13 2 77 was achieved along with tvfa concentration in a range of 3 6 5 3 g l meanwhile baldi et al 2019 operated the first stage of acidogenesis for co digestion of fw and was at an olr of 14 6 g vs l d corresponding to obtained tvfa alkalinity ratio range between 1 07 and 1 26 which is partially agreed with the tvfa alkalinity ratio range 1 00 2 27 obtained from this investigation as previously mentioned the results achieved from the cstr1 are in accordance with the concept of two stage digestion in which the hydrolysis and acidogenesis step were occurred mainly in addition the cstr1 virtually functioned as the pre treatment step to enhancing the hydrolysis process and solubilization of was gs prior to feeding to the cstr2 the effluent from cstr1 was then further digested in cstr2 to generate methane based biogas 3 2 2 the second methanogenic reactor fig 3 shows the performance of the cstr2 during anaerobic digestion of the effluent from cstr1 to mainly produce methane based bio gas the effluent from cstr1 of rwas gs cwas gs and dwas gs digestion at 4 day hrt was further used as substrate in cstr2 with 20 day hrt corresponding to an olr range of 0 54 1 93 g vs l d i iii and v meanwhile the effluent from cstr1 of dwas gs digestion at 3 day hrt is further used as substrate in cstr2 with 15 and 17 day hrt corresponding to an olr range of 2 26 2 57 g vs l d iv and vi the average methane production rate was increased from 257 8 19 ml ch4 l d to 877 8 30 ml ch4 l d by increasing olr from 0 54 g vs l d to 1 93 g vs l d further increasing olr of to 2 57 g vs l d by feeding the effluent from cstr1 at 3 day hrt to the cstr2 at 15 day hrt foam formation was observed along with unstable biogas production the cstr2 was then shifted to be operated at increased hrt of 20 days by feeding with the effluent from cstr1 of dwas gs v using 4 day hrt stable methane production with an average methane production rate of 877 8 30 ml ch4 l d was achieved without any foam formation the cstr2 was further decreased hrt to 17 days by feeding with 3 day hrt effluent from cstr1 of gs dwas vi consequently the stable methane production was observed with an average rate of 957 0 86 ml ch4 l d foaming formation could be described with two following reasons 1 high protein content in loading protein is one of the surface active agents in anaerobic foaming proteins are less biodegradable than lipid and fiber accumulation of proteins at the air liquid interface could be facilitated during anaerobic digestion due to their surface active properties which could then lead to enhanced foaming potential 2 filamentous microorganisms gordonia species and m parvicella containing in was could cause foaming in anaerobic digestion the presentation of filamentous bacteria in the anaerobic digester s vapor liquid interface along with the potential for bio surfactant generation generally results in decreasing sludge surface tension and increasing foaming potential ganidi et al 2009 the cstr2 stability was analyzed through ph tvfa and alkalinity as shown in fig 3b c and table 2 the ph value of the effluent from the cstr1 which was fed to the cstr2 was in a range of 6 22 6 54 meanwhile the ph of effluent was increased to a range of 7 22 7 72 tvfa concentration was in range of 0 24 1 73 g l while alkalinity in range of 3 99 6 14 g caco3 l with tvfa alkalinity ratio of 0 06 0 30 was recorded these results indicate that the cstr2 had stable performance for anaerobic co digestion of was and gs however operating the cstr2 at the hrt of 15 days could result in high tvfa alkalinity ratio of 0 30 martín gonzález et al 2013 has recommended tvfa alkalinity ratio below 0 3 to achieve stable reactor performance table 2 shows the overall process performance of the two stage anaerobic digestion of gs and was the most suitable performance with the highest methane generation rate of 957 0 86 ml ch4 l d corresponding to a methane yield of 423 4 36 ml ch4 g vs was achieved by the two stage anaerobic co digestion of dwas gs from the cstr1 and the cstr2 operated at hrt of 3 days and 17 days respectively the stability of the process in terms of tvfa alkalinity ratio was 0 21 furthermore vs and cod removal one of the key parameters to guarantee the two stage stage anaerobic co digestion process of was and gs for treatment of tuna canning wastewater and recovery of methane gas the vs and cod removal in cstr1 were 55 6 and 67 5 respectively with the vs removal calculated by measuring influent and effluent vs while cod removal is calculated by hydrogen and methane production similar methane production rate of 1070 ml ch4 l d was achieved from the two stage anaerobic co digestion of was and fw two cstrs in series operated at 37 c and at 3 day hrt olr 12 6 g vs l d and 12 day hrt olr 2 5 g vs l d for the first and second stage respectively baldi et al 2019 in addition the protein destruction during anaerobic co digestion of was and gs in the pilot scale two stage process experimental results including methane production rate acids concentration and organic matter concentrations cod vs and ts were incorporated to simulate the modified adm 1 model implemented in gps x software simulated results of the two stage co digestion of dwas and gs at 3 day and 17 day hrt for cstr1 and cstr2 respectively provided hydrolysis constant of protein of 2 5 d 1and protein destruction rate of 0 57 g cod l d accounting to overall protein destruction of 69 manuscript in preparation mass balance in the two stage anaerobic co digestion system was performed in cod term by using experimental results achieved from co digestion of different was types rwas cwas dwas and gs at 4 days for cstr1 and 20 days for cstr2 as shown in table 3 the cod of vfas in the cstr1 supposedly derived from carbohydrates is around 5 10 of total influent cod the other product component in the cstr1 accounting to around 91 95 of total influent cod could probably be lcfa amino acids non hydrolyzed lipid protein carbohydrates and cell mass meanwhile effluent cod from cstr1 was majorly converted to methane in the cstr2 operated at 20 day hrt in a range between 70 72 methane production obtained from mixed rwas gs and mixed cwas gs is insignificantly different p 0 05 meanwhile mixed dwas gs at rather high olr is significantly different p 0 05 compared to methane production from either mixed rwas gs or mixed cwas gs the other component product that remained in the cstr2 accounting to around 25 4 29 9 which could properly be difficult biodegradable compounds in both soluble and suspended form the cod balance reveals that total cod influent could be removed from the two stage anaerobic system only in h2 and ch4 form furthermore satisfactory methane yields were obtained from various mixing ratios of was and gs indicating that the pilot scale two stage anaerobic co digestion process established in this investigation could be interchangeably operated at various mixing ratios of was and gs 3 3 microbial community structure in the two stage anaerobic co digestion of was and gs relative abundance of the microbial community kingdom a bacteria at the phylum level b and archaea at the genus level c described microbial community in the cstr1 and cstr2 are demonstrated in fig 4 the relative abundance of bacteria in the cstr1 higher than that in the cstr2 are in accordance with bacterial activity in cstr1 which is relied on hydrolysis and acidogenesis step the bacteria accounted for 91 38 and 50 10 in the cstr1 and the cstr2 respectively bacterial sequences obtained from cstr1 indicate dominant phyla in bacterial community of firmicutes 48 56 proteobacteria 24 52 bacteroidetes 5 65 and chloroflexi 4 11 meanwhile the main bacterial community phyla in cstr2 were dominated with firmicutes 34 06 proteobacteria 35 28 bacteroidetes 9 73 and chloroflexi 4 47 firmicuter and bacteroidetes are important microorganisms for degrading saccharides and protein as well as enriching at a rapid multiplication rate in growth environment where soluble organic matter is high concentration garcia peña et al 2011 in addition firmicutes as fermentative and syntrophic bacteria could also biodegrade vfas such as butyrate kabisch et al 2014 whereas proteobacteria and chloroflexi are also important bacteria hydrolysis and acidification in the anaerobic digestion system dai et al 2016 the relative abundances of archaea communities are also shown in fig 4 a c it can be seen that archaea in the cstr2 were more dominant than that in the cstr1 the main genus of archaea was methanosaseata accounting for 97 39 and 99 57 in cstr1 and cstr2 respectively the methanosaseata is acetoclastic methanogens utilizing acetate as a substrate for methane production dai et al 2016 in addition methanobacterium methanolinea and methanosarcina were also rarely detected 1 the type and nature of the microbial community that present in the reactor environment impacts how well a two stage anaerobic digester performs and seed organisms or inoculum type have a huge impact on reactor dynamics rajendran et al 2020 from this study the anaerobic digestion was separated into two reactors and operated under different conditions resulting in changes in microbial community dynamics the cstr1 was operated under high olr 12 7 g vs l d and short hrt 3 days leading to have bacteria dominance in the first stage 90 while archaea existing in the cstr2 was contributed from operating under low olr 2 3 g vs l d and long hrt 17 days these observations are in line with the concept of two stage anaerobic digestion in which the first stage anaerobic bacteria enhance rich organic acids hydrolysate from harsh substrate for further feeding to producing methane based biogas by methanogenic archaea the firmicutes phylum having significant dominance 48 in the cstr1 is capable of converting diverse carbon substrates to vfas especially acetate thus this vfas based cstr1 effluent is the most attractive carbon source for acetoclastic methanogenesis in the cstr2 meanwhile effective metabolisms in the cstr2 were achieved mostly by 99 dominant methanosaeta and major bacteria i e firmicutes proteobacteria responsible for hydrolysis and acetogenesis of undigested organic matters discharged from the cstr1 thus employing two stage anaerobic digester is capable of splitting the consortia and providing optimum conditions for each targeted group 3 4 economy analysis according to the experimental results the pilot scale two stage anaerobic co digestion process of dwas gs provided biogas production rate of 1 59 l biogas l d with methane content in a range between 62 and 66 under operating conditions of total 20 day hrt 3 days for cstr1 and 17 days for cstr2 corresponding to olr 2 26 g vs l d meanwhile the single stage anaerobic digestion of gs in commercial scale of scc songkla province thailand with 20 day hrt olr of 2 2 g vs l d at ambient temperature could produce 0 56 l biogas l d having methane content in a range between 45 and 55 this could be implied that the pilot two stage anaerobic co digestion process of was and gs is practical feasibility to enhance biodegradability and biogas production simultaneously however economic feasibility is another important factor for final decisions to up scale this two stage process thus economic terms including net present value npv payback period pbp and internal rate of return irr were used to evaluate the economic feasibility of the pilot scale two stage anaerobic co digestion process couple with absorption process for further h2s and co2 removal by water absorbent rattanaya et al 2022 fig 5 shows cod and mass balance and the scenario used to analyze economic feasibility of the two stage anaerobic co digestion process of dwas and gs influent composition used for mass balance was obtained from run vi operating conditions dwas and gs discharged from the scc were simultaneously pumped with real flow rates of 5 m3 d and 70 m3 d respectively to 321 m3 digester having working volume 225 m3 with 3 day hrt for cstr1 and further transferred to 1821 m3 digester having working volume of 1275 m3 with 17 day hrt for the cstr2 according to the previously experimental result obtained from the most suitable operating conditions biogas production rate of 1793 m3 d was expected with 70 methane content in biogas water scrubber was chosen for biogas upgrading with 95 co2 removal efficacy misrol et al 2019 the capital expenditure and operating expenditure capex and opex of the system was estimated for biogas digester and biogas upgrading technology according to abas et al 2013 and lim et al 2021 the capex for cstr technology is 422 4 usd m3 digseter base on year 2018 while biogas upgrading technology is 87 000 usd for 452 m3 hr raw biogas base on year 2019 misrol et al 2019 hence the cost escalation method is used to forecast the future cost as shown in eq 1 1 c r c p c e p c i c r c e p c i c p where c r is the inflation adjusted cost in current year c p is the inflation adjusted cost in previous year c e p c i c r is the cost index for chemical engineering plant in current year c e p c i c p is the cost index for chemical engineering plant in previous year the chemical engineering plant cost index cepci was used for calculation of cost of product in current year the cepci base on year 2009 2018 and 2021 are 521 9 603 1 and 754 7 correlation factor for economies of scale n was used for estimated the cost in case of different scale from the previous as showed in eq 2 the traditional index of 0 6 vo et al 2018 was used as a n for economy of scale sizing exponent 2 n e w c o s t o r i g i n a l c o s t n e w s i z e o r i g i n a l s i z e n the the opex was consisted of fixed and variable operating costs and estimated at 2 of capex for anaerobic digestion unit abas et al 2013 the biogas upgrading unit s opex was estimated to be 3 of capex and 0 275 kwh m3 biogas of electricity misrol et al 2019 the npv irr and pbp are used as valuation criteria to analyze the profitability of the system the npv is the total present value of net income and the system is profitable when npv is more than zero eq 3 is given as a formula for determine npv 3 n p v n 1 n t z n 1 i n c a p e x where z n is the net cash flow and i is the interest rate 15 and z n can be calculated by eq 4 4 z n r e v e n u e o p e x where r e v e n u e is the methane production in the process where 0 3 usd m3 methane misrol et al 2019 while pbp refers to the amount of time it takes to recover the capital investment cost which is one parameter of economic profitability the pbp was calculated based on capex value and z n as a shown in eq 5 5 p b p c a p e x z n the internal rate of return irr is an investment appraisal measurement used to evaluate profitability investments of system in general the higher an irr makes the project more attractive the investment the irr calculations use the same formula as npv calculation by giving the npv to zero as shown in eq 6 6 n p v n 1 n t z n 1 i r r n c a p e x 0 the economic analysis result based on scenario use is shown in table 4 c a p e x and o p e x of 250 986 usd and 34 409 usd year were respectively achieved revenue of proposed system reached 119 592 usd year with net cash flow of 83 069 usd year the economic estimation was based on project life of 20 years and the 15 discount rate the value of npv pbp and irr 250 177 usd 3 years and 30 respectively the economic feasibility of this case shows a high npv values which is greater economic benefit and pbp shows good economic situation this result shows two stage anaerobic co digestion process of dwas and gs is economically feasible to be established in full scale plant furthermore burning biogas as a heat source could lower greenhouse gas ghg emissions ghgs such as methane and carbon dioxide have negative global and climate impacts thus the combustion of biogas for heating e g boiler electricity generation cooking is increasingly vital in reducing ghg emissions in this scenario the greenhouse gas production co2 was 781 tons year 1 96 kg co2 m3 biogas akbulut 2012 if the system was occurred for flaring then the ghg emission was produced 5444 tons year 9 2 kg co2 m3 biogas akbulut 2012 by comparing the capex per methane revenue with previous studies analyzed for different systems and feedstock vo et al 2018 studied economic analysis of co digestion of grass silage and manure in two series cstr with biogas upgrading by amine scrubber the capex per methane revenue was 1 82 usd m3 methane year another report from mahmod et al 2021 evaluated economic feasibility of two stage anaerobic digestion of palm mill effluent and reported 0 01 usd m3 methane year the capex per methane revenue of this study 0 63 usd m3 methane year is therefore fitted within the range of previous study currently several pretreatment methods of was have been studied including alkalinity thermal microwave and ultrasonic pretreatment abudi et al 2016 kuglarz et al 2013 xu et al 2014 these pretreatment methods could technically enhance the solubilization of the was cost and energy input at an industrial scale were considerably high ye et al 2016 dhar et al 2012 reported pretreatment costs for thermal and ultrasonic pretreatment of 62 and 196 usd ton sludge respectively meanwhile cho et al 2014 reported capital investment in alkaline mechanical pretreatment of was to enhancing anaerobic digestion of 278 usd m3 thickened was d while operating cost of 14 usd m3 thickened was d with 6 71 years for payback and achieved 55 vs destruction this shows 8 3 cost investment from this study to invest alkaline mechanical pre treatment of was before single stage anaerobic digestion rajendran et al 2020 was reported cost investment of two stage process over single stage process 3 therefore two stage anaerobic co digestion pretreatment of was and gs is more economically feasible according to technical data obtained from the pilot scale experiment 4 conclusion the two stage anaerobic co digestion dwas gs showed considerably high methane production rate comparing to that of rwas gs and cwas gs the highest methane production rate of 957 ml ch4 l d corresponding to methane yield of 423 ml ch4 g vs was achieved at 3 and 17 day hrt in cstr1 and cstr2 with enrichment of phylum firmicuters and bacteroidetes and genus methanosaseata economic analysis reveals feasibility for further establishment of full scale two stage anaerobic process for co digestion of was and gs with pbp 3 years and irr 30 according to the succession on performance and economic viability this two stage anaerobic process is expected for further application in a commercial scale declaration of competing interest the authors declare

15714,recently increasing attention has been paid to antibiotic resistance genes args in urban stormwater runoff however no available literature could be found on args leaching from urban underlying surface sediments during stormwater runoff in this study surface sediments from commercial public squares around nanjing china was selected for the investigation of target args leaching kinetics showing that absolute abundances of target args desorption reached at the equilibrium during leaching time of 120 240min with all of the desorption efficiencies about 30 indicating that there would be low proportion of leaching args in the total args migrating with runoff during rainfall events five target args leaching including inti1 clinic stra strb tetm and tetx can be better described by the pseudo second order equation while qacedelta1 leaching can be better described by the pseudo first order equation and the leaching for both sul1 and sul2 can be well described by the pseudo first order and pseudo second order equations the effects of environmental factors including s l ratios ph values and water temperatures indicated that leaching efficiencies of target args enhanced significantly with the increase of s l ratios and water temperatures but decreased with the increase of ph values the transmission experiments after the simulated solar irradiation and heat implied that both large solar uv irradiation 30w m2 and high temperature 40 were conducive to conjugation and transformation frequencies of args furthermore both high cao and medium pam levels could be effective for blocking args transmission in the leachate from underlying surface sediments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords stormwater runoff road deposited sediments antibiotic resistance genes leaching transmission 1 introduction in recent years diffuse contamination generated by surface runoff has been a key factor in the deterioration of water body quality in urban areas müller et al 2020 which would pose a health risk to downstream receiving water bodies in particular as emerging pollutants antibiotic resistance genes args have been increasingly reported in rainwater runoff garner et al 2017 zuo et al 2022a due to replicability biological characteristics and persistence physical characteristics pachepsky et al 2008 args could spread continuously and survive for a long time in the environment how to reduce args from sources would be one of the effective ways to block its entry into water environment through stormwater runoff the underlying surface sediments like road deposited sediments rds and atmospheric dry and or wet deposition were the direct sources of runoff pollutants baral et al 2018 zhan et al 2020 the previous study reported that underlying surface sediments were the main source of heavy metals in stormwater runoff zuo et al 2012 kim and ko 2021 reported that rds was an important mediator transferring anthropogenic pollutants to stormwater runoff furthermore the content of pollutants in runoff can be determined by the transport process of rainfall runoff on underlying surface sediments for example zafra et al 2017 reported that solid and dissolved fractions contributed 70 7 and 29 3 of the potential heavy metal load washed off by runoff from rds respectively yang et al 2021 claimed that the precipitation pattern strongly impacted rds wash off discharge and removal and the downstream installed green infrastructures reduced the rds induced stormwater pollution by up to 68 however there was no available information about the wash off processes of args from rds into stormwater runoff transport solid fraction and leaching dissolved fraction were two main processes for the underlying surface sediments and their surface pollutants through wash off into stormwater runoff zafra et al 2017 transport was related to rainfall characteristics and particle sizes zhao et al 2016 while leaching on underlying surface sediments was affected by ph and organic matters kim and ko 2021 zhang et al 2016 args in underlying surface sediments will probably enter runoff via the transport because the hosts intracellular args iargs and free dna extracellular args eargs could both adhere to particles mceachran et al 2015 this was proved by the fact that many types of args in stormwater runoff were dominant in particulate matter with size 75 μm like ermf blaoxa1 qnra sul2 zuo et al 2022a and that every gram of sludge dry weight from hospital pharmaceutical industry wastewater treatment plant wwtp and swine manure and sediment in urban lake the potential sources of underlying surface sediments contained from 7 31 103 to 1 16 1010 copies of eargs and from 1 04 105 to 2 74 1012 copies of intracellular args dong et al 2019 however lu et al 2021 found that args could be desorbed from titanium dioxide and zero valent iron indicating that leaching might be one of the potential approaches for arg moving into stormwater runoff at present studies mainly focused on the leaching of conventional pollutants in underlying surface sediment like nitrogen and heavy metals zhang et al 2016 zafra et al 2017 kim and ko 2021 including leaching efficiency kinetics joshi et al 2009 and its contribution to runoff borris et al 2016 there was no available information on args leaching processes from the underlying surface sediments which was one of the keys for args transferring from sediments to runoff the leaching processes were comprised of physical separation and chemical desorption beeston et al 2010 penn et al 2014 and greatly affected by temperature and ph peng et al 2020 meanwhile the previous literature reported that concentrations of particulate matter in stormwater runoff were varying for different rainfall events zuo et al 2011 reflecting the difference in solid s sediments to liquid l stormwater runoff ratios for the leaching processes peng et al 2020 claimed that all leachate i e soluble p fluoride zn pb as and hg extraction concentrations were significantly sensitive to the effect of the s l ratio this indicated that the mentioned factors could affect the leaching processes for both eargs and iargs meanwhile the transduction was the main mechanism of free args transmitting into the receptor bacteria wang et al 2020a resulting in the risk of antibiotic resistance diffusion while iargs in donor bacteria could enter the receptor bacteria through conjugation transfer wang et al 2015 however the risk of args transmission through the leaching from underlying surface sediments is not still clear uv disinfection and heat treatment also had a certain effect on args chu et al 2020 wang et al 2020b which implied that solar irradiation and high temperature might affect args transmission by the leaching under the in situ condition of underlying surface sediments furthermore loganathan et al 2013 reviewed that many of the studies on rds pollutant management dealt with reducing pollutants by road sweeping and water flushing while found to be not very effective this suggested that the risk of leaching induced args transmission could not be controlled by only cleaning on the other hand zheng et al 2019 reported that args removal in municipal sewage sludge by chemical conditioning with polyacrylamide pam or with fe iii and calcium oxide cao thereinto pam can bond particles with small sizes in the process of cleaning and cao was widely used as a fungicide bae et al 2006 hijikataet al 2016 this provided a reference for the control of args risk due to the leaching from underlying surface sediments in this study therefore the underlying surface sediments from commercial public squares in nanjing china with large population densities and frequent human activities were selected to investigate typical args leaching kinetics analyze the effects of environmental factors including s l ratios ph values and water temperatures evaluate transmission risks of leaching args under the simulated solar irradiation and high temperatures and explore the possible control of leaching args transmission by the pretreatment of pam or cao in order to provide a new insight for blocking args transmission from urban commercial areas via stormwater runoff 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites and samples collection nanjing is the largest city in jiangsu province of china and situated in the southwest region it is the capital city of jiangsu province the climate of nanjing is north sub tropical humid with an annual average temperature of 15 3 c and annual precipitation total of 1065 mm the highest intensity of solar uv irradiation is about 30 w m2 with 4 hours of the annual average irradiation time while average intensity of uv irradiation at 10 am 2 pm was in the range of 6 18 w m2 there are 11 districts under its jurisdiction with a population approaching to 10 million and the average population density of the city is 1291 people km2 five square areas 1 1 m were chosen at 13 sampling sites the commercial public square areas ranging from 0 3 0 5 km2 s1 of the supplementary materials during june 7 8 2020 following an average dry weather period of about one week based on local weather forecast for the past three years and our previous study zuo et al 2011 zuo et al 2012 the underlying surface sediment samples were collected using a domestic vacuum cleaner philips fc8516 and brushes sterilized by 75 ethanol weights of the mentioned samples were in the range of 30 90 gram at each square area and a total of 65 samples were collected after the collection sediments were mixed proportionally for the simulated experiments 2 2 the simulated experiments 2 2 1 leaching experiments the leaching or desorption characteristics of args in the mixed sediments were evaluated using 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks as reaction vessels using an orbital shaker with 250 rpm at various time intervals 2g of sediments to the leachate deionized water ratios s l 1 10 1 20 and 1 30 according to tss levels found in our previous study zuo et al 2011 leachate temperatures 10 20 and 30 based on climate of sampling sites and ph values 5 7 and 9 due to 6 4 8 42 of actual stormwater runoff reported by kim and ko 2021 subsamples of the supernatant were collected after placing 30 min and filtered through a 0 45 μm filter to obtain the leachate 2 2 2 solar irradiation and high temperature based on our previous studies zuo et al 2015 zuo et al 2016 and solar uv irradiation information of sampling sites the 10w black light lamp philips was applied to model solar irradiation and the solar radiation was evaluated in terms of solar uv irradiance which is defined as the rate at which solar radiant energy is incident on a surface per unit area of surface w m2 sichel et a 2007 before experiments the mixed sediments 1g were respectively overlaid onto the 10 cm diameter sterile pyrex crystallizing dishes then the pyrex crystallizing dishes with the sediment was placed on the center under the lamp and the irradiance value at the center of was about 10 20 30 w m2 for 4 h based on solar uv irradiation of sampling sites likewise the mixed sediments 2g were dry heated in an oven at different temperatures 10 25 and 40 of simulated air temperature for 4 h according to the climate of sampling sites after two above treatments the mixed sediments were used to obtain the leachate based on the leaching experiments the initial mixed sediment was used as the control 2 2 3 experiments of risk controls the controls of args leaching risk were evaluated using 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks as reaction vessels using an orbital shaker with 250 rpm at 0 5 h 1g l the mixed sediments and the varying cao doses 1 mg l 5 mg l and 10 mg l or pam doses 1 mg l 5 mg l and 10 mg l based on the previous literatures bae et al 2006 hijikataet al 2016 ding et al 2018 subsamples of the supernatant were collected after placing 30 min and then filtered through a 0 45 μm filter to obtain the leachate the initial mixed sediment was used as the control 2 3 transmission experiments both e coli k 12 with plasmid rp4 carrying tetracycline args and aminoglycoside args and the free plasmid pwh1266 were applied to spike args in the mixed sediments for the transmission experiments conjugation transfer system and experimental conditions were set based on the previous literature lu et al 2018 the donor e coli k 12 and recipient bacteria e coli hb101 carrying streptomycin sulfate resistance were placed in liquid lb and cultured overnight at 37 followed by centrifugation 5 min at 5000 rpm after the centrifugation the supernatants were removed and the residual were washed by phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7 2 and re suspended in calculated volumes of pbs to obtain 1 108 cfu ml bacterial concentrations then the donor and recipient bacteria were mixed at a ratio of 1 1 and treated in the leachate from different experiments for 6 h transformation system and experimental conditions were in line with the one reported by wang et al 2020a firstly pwh1266 plasmid was prepared and suspended in elution buffer 10 mm tris hcl and stored at 80 concentration 210 ng μl 1 ml a baylyi adp1 culture were cultured in 100 ml lb broth overnight at 30 then the 500 μl overnight culture was inoculated into 50 ml liquid lb 1 ml v v in a 100 ml glass bottle when the glass bottle was incubated in a constant temperature shaking incubator at 30 for 6 h the culture reached the early stationary growth stage the od600 was 1 1 the bacterial concentration was 3 108 cfu ml the bacteria were then collected by the centrifugation then precipitated washed and re suspended using the pbs solution the plasmid was added to a baylyi adp1 culture at the final concentration of 0 8 ng μl calculated to 8 34 107 copies μl and then added sodium acetate 100 mg l treated in the leachate from different experiments for 6 h all transmission experiments were processed in triplicate 2 4 leaching kinetics a wide range of models have been used to describe leaching kinetics of args from the mixed sediments inculding pseudo first order model pseudo second order model elovich and power function the corresponding kinetic equations their linear forms as well as the fitting parameters are listed in s2 of the supplementary materials 2 5 analysis methods the high throughput sequencing was consistent with the previous literature zuo and suo 2022b the absolute abundance for both typical args and mobile genetic elements mges in mixed sediments were tested through the smartchip real time pcr systems anhui microanaly gene technology co ltd china including tetracycline resistance genes tetm and tetx aminoglycoside resistance genes stra and strb sulfonamide resistance genes sul1 and sul2 multidrug resistance genes qacedelta1 and inti1 primers information is described in s3 of the supplementary materials detailed procedures are given in test s1 results are reported as absolute abundances of args calculated through multiplying the value of relative gene copy number of args by the absolute copy number of 16s rrna gene xie et al 2016 briefly the absolute abundances of args were obtained in three steps first copy number of each gene on the chip was calculated by the follow equation gene copy number 10 31 ct 10 3 where threshold cycle ct referred to quantitative pcr result and 31 was identified as the detection limit looft et al 2012 second divide the arg copy number on the chip by that of the 16s rrna gene third multiply the value from the second step by the absolute copy numbers of 16s rrna gene the absolute copy numbers of 16s rrna genes were quantified as described previously ouyang et al 2015 all experiments were done in triplicate and then the average of three replicate experiments was calculated and used for data interpretation data analysis graphing was conducted by origin version 8 3 results and discussions 3 1 leaching kinetics the absolute abundances of target args desorption reached at the equilibrium during leaching time of 120 240 min fig 1 with all of the desorption efficiencies about 30 compared with the conventional pollutants zhang et al 2016 kim and ko 2021 leaching efficiencies of these target args were quite low which could be due to the fact that both iargs and eargs could adhere well with particles demaneche et al 2001 wang et al 2019 it indicated that there would be low proportion of leaching args in the total args migrating with runoff during rainfall events however the absolute abundances of these target args were different and still a risk of antibiotic resistance transmission meanwhile the desorption processes of the target args mainly occurred in the first 60 min when all desorption efficiencies got to about 80 of the peak or the desorption equilibrium thereinto the proportion of tetm desorption was the highest with 87 51 it indicated that the potential risk of args in stormwater runoff at the first 60 min could be the highest from the perspective of rainfall duration this was in line with that the impact of runoff on receiving water bodies mainly focused on its initial 30 min the initial effect bakr et al 2020 ding et al 2022 on the other hand there was no correlation for the leaching of the same types of args for example desorption efficiencies of tetm was the largest while the one of tetx was lower with 78 09 based on s4 of the supplementary materials the extracellular tetm abundances were greater than the intracellular tetm abundances in the underlying surface sediments from sampling sites while free dna was easy to be adsorbed by particles mceachran et al 2015 this seemed to be contradictory for the largest desorption efficiencies of tetm the further study of desorption mechanism need to be carried out from the perspective of nucleobase effect hydrophobic interaction and van der waals vdw force li et al 2019 in addition there were different correlations between target args and dominant bacteria in this study zuo and suo 2022b and desorption processes of different bacteria from sediments would not be consistent which also confirmed the differences in the desorption processes of target args fig 1 desorption kinetics could significantly impact the pathway and mechanism of leaching reactions li et al 2019 based on the fitting parameters listed in s5 of the supplementary materials the leaching kinetics of target args could be well described by different kinetic equations five target args including inti1 clinic stra strb tetm and tetx can be better described by the pseudo second order equation indicating that the leaching processes of these args were dominated by chemical desorption mechanism yin et al 2020 but qacedelta1 can be better described by the pseudo first order equation implying that the leaching process of qacedelta1 was dominated by physical diffusion wei et al 2018 sulfonamides resistance genes sul1 and sul2 can be well described by both the pseudo first order and pseudo second order equations illustrating that their leaching processes could consist of both physical diffusion and chemical desorption there were currently many literatures on the dynamics of pollutants in river and lake sediments frachini et al 2021 and soils wei et al 2018 while few literatures could be found on the one in urban underlying surface sediments the only literatures focused on the use of pseudo first and second order equations to simulate heavy metal leaching in urban underlying surface sediments joshi et al 2009 and its impact on urban surface runoff zhang et al 2019 this suggested that there was a certain correlation between desorption kinetics of args and the one of heavy metals in the underlying surface sediments which might be related to the easy bonding of heavy metals and bacteria hosts of args xu et al 2020 3 2 effects of environmental factors 3 2 1 ratios of solid to liquid the leaching efficiencies of target args enhanced significantly with the increase of s l ratios fig 2 where stra had the largest leaching efficiencies with 37 35 under s l ratios of 1 30 which reflected that the increase of runoff volume would result in the more args leaching amount for chemical pollutants the chemical desorption processes are usually short resulting in the low leaching amount in this study the leaching of inti1 clinic stra strb tetm and tetx were determined by chemical desorption but showed different profiles for the effect of s l ratios in particular it was the most obvious for both stra and strb resisting mpicillins the different correlations between target args and dominant bacteria zuo and suo 2022b should be the main reason the previous literature found that bacterial community structure in estuarine sediments was the main driving factor of args variance zhao et al 2020 although no similar studies could be reported in the underlying surface sediments the mentioned relationship could be consistent because bacterial community is the main host of args in the environments on the other hand there was no linear relationship between the leaching efficiencies of target args and s l ratios and the amplification of leaching efficiencies decreased significantly with the increase of s l ratios indicating that there would be limit values for the amount of args leaching into stormwater runoff this was consistent with the influence of s l ratios on the leaching of heavy metals from lignite fly ash darakas et al 2013 firstly bacteria or dna can be hardly dissolved in the solution which is different from conventional chemical pollutants second both intracellular and extracellular dna could be desorbed but also adsorbed barrios et al 2021 and there was the equilibrium between adsorption and desorption the previous literature reported that the equilibrium between adsorption and desorption of dna depended on the physical and chemical properties of the adsorbent and its role relationship with the adsorbate xue and feng 2018 thus the equilibrium between adsorption and desorption for target args in the underlying surface sediments was not determined by s l ratios 3 2 2 water temperatures the leaching efficiencies of target args in the underlying surface sediments gradually increased with the raise of water temperatures fig 3 when water temperature was at 30 the leaching efficiencies for both stra and tetm reached about 41 followed by sul1 sul2 tetx and qacedelta1 with 37 and the lowest was strb with less than 30 it has been proved that the adsorption process was an exothermic process jiang et al 2018 implying that the increase of water temperatures would be not conducive to the adsorption processes meanwhile it is well known that desorption is a process relative to adsorption thus adjusting temperature could change the equilibrium capacity of sediments for args comparing with the effect of s l ratios the linear relationship between leaching efficiencies and water temperature is more obvious with all of the correlation coefficient r2 greater than 0 95 in addition the 30 of water temperature in this study agreed with the actual situation although the used water temperature can be higher 3 2 3 ph values the leaching of target args in the underlying surface sediments gradually decreased with the increase of ph values fig 4 under acidic conditions the leaching efficiencies of target args were the highest where the one of tetm was 58 88 and that of strb was 34 76 while leaching efficiencies of other args were between 40 and 50 under alkaline conditions target args leaching efficiencies were all not more than 20 it indicated that the amount of args leaching into runoff was less than the one migrating into runoff with particles which was coincident with that iargs was found to be dominant in this study s4 of the supplementary materials the lowest ph values of rainwater provide the optimal conditions for leaching of particle bound pollutants such as heavy metals wang et al 2017a the conventional pollutants like nitrogen phosphorus and organic matter were easier to leach from sewage sludge batziaka et al 2008 as the increase of ph values the cation exchange after protonation of dna molecules but also at higher ph values probably by hydrogen bridges between cooal or coofe groups of humic substances and the rnh2 groups of dna was the main mechanism for dna adsorption crecchio et al 2005 the more args leaching at low ph could be due to the fact that adsorption processes are opposite to desorption processes and the found that the desorption kinetics in this study was mainly chemical desorption meanwhile there was a certain linear relationship between args leaching from the underlying surface sediments and ph values and the correlation coefficients were all greater than 0 97 suggesting the significant effect of ph values 3 3 transmission risks of leaching args 3 3 1 transmission after the simulated solar irradiation solar uv irradiation could kill a range of antibiotic resistant s aureus e coli and k pneumoniae when they were subjected for 4 h giannakis et al 2018 but the dosage of uv did not guarantee the complete inactivation of args because uv had no lasting residual disinfection ability and there may be photoreactivation and dark repair limiting the effectiveness of uv disinfection zhang et al 2020 in this study conjugation frequencies for both tetracycline resistance genes and aminoglycoside resistance genes were found to decrease fig 5 compared to the one without the simulated solar irradiation the control thereinto conjugation frequencies of tetracycline resistance genes at uv dose 10 w m2 agreed with that at uv dose 20 w m2 while greatly reduced at uv dose 30 w m2 the conjugation frequencies of aminoglycoside resistance genes were obvious inversely proportional to uv doses there was effective removal of args only when the dose of uv exceeded 100 mj cm2 zhang et al 2020 meanwhile guo and kong 2019 claimed that even 1 mj cm2 uv disinfection can significantly decrease the conjugative transfer frequency of the survival bacteria however wang et al 2020b reported that until uv dosage enhanced to 320 mj cm2 args achieved 0 58 1 60 log removal furthermore uv disinfection increased the potential health risk of args in wastewater jia et al 2021 in this study uv dose was much higher than the one reported by the mentioned literatures but there was still a risk of transmission which could be attributed to the bacterial dna repair suss et al 2009 after uv irradiation meanwhile the simulated solar irradiation in this study was different from the individual uvc irradiation although uvc irradiation could damage the genome of microorganisms to hinder replication oguma and rattanakul 2021 in addition zhang et al 2017 claimed that uv disinfection caused a selective change in the inhibition zone diameters of surviving antibiotic resistant e coli and a slight damage to args however transformation frequencies of tetracycline resistance genes could be found to increase at varying degrees under different uv doses compared with the control which could be also due to bacterial dna repair suss et al 2009 after uv irradiation in all there would be the low transmission risk of args leaching from sediments entering into receiving environments through stormwater during the summer periods with intense solar irradiation 3 3 2 transmission after the simulated heat results from fig 6 showed that profiles of target args conjugation frequencies with the increase of the simulated air temperature were similar to the one of args transformation frequencies where their highest reached at 25 but the conjugation frequencies for args were the lowest at 10 and also decreased at 40 while transformation frequency of args was the lowest at 40 this indicated that high temperature weather could be conducive to reduce the transmission risk of args in the leachate from the underlying surface sediments which was consistent with the effect of temperature during composting for example directly raising temperature can decrease mefa and tetw relative abundances during storage of manure slurries li et al 2020 similarly the significant reduction of args in heated piles was observed in the first trial staley et al 2021 however the leaching efficiencies of target args in the underlying surface sediments gradually increased with the increase of water temperature which was in line with air temperatures zuo et al 2012 since the quantitative relationship of args leaching amount with air temperature was still uncertain it was not clear whether high temperature can reduce the transmission risks of args leaching from the underlying surface sediments caused by stormwater at present studies about args transmission are mainly focused on the use of simulated target args in laboratory conditions which added great difficulty to analyze the mentioned quantitative relationship future work should be the breakthrough of transmission mechanism under complex environment conditions including the underlying surface sediments 3 4 transmission controlled by cao or pam two tentative pathways that might be applicable to control the transmission risk of args leaching from underlying surface sediments are presented in fig 7 where the conjugation frequencies in the leachate decreased with the increase of cao concentrations the conjugation frequencies of the two args were 22 35 and 39 68 of the control group respectively when cao concentration reached 10 mg l indicating cao was one of the potential methods blocking args conjugation in the leachate from underlying surface sediments previous literatures focused on the sterilization by the use of cao for instance all three bacteria were not greatly affected by cao solutions at concentrations of 0 01 and 0 03 however the decline of e coli 99 2 78 log cfu ml l monocytogrens 45 1 44 log cfu ml and s typhimurium 70 2 08 log cfu ml was greatest when they were exposed to 0 05 cao solution for 10 min bae et al 2006 similarly an increasing concentration of cao significantly reduced the microbial population compared with the control kang and bin song 2017 meanwhile the alkaline treated compost with cao or ash resulted primarily in damage to the outer membrane and enzyme activities of e coli hijikata et al 2016 these could be responsible for the decrease in conjugation frequencies from cao treatment in addition increased cao concentration would lead to an increase of ph values especially alkaline ph in the leachate which further caused the decrease of args leaching efficiencies in this study and then prevented the transmission risk of args leaching from underlying surface sediments through stormwater on the other hand compared with the control there were different profiles about conjugation and transformation frequencies of args in the leachate under the treatment of varying pam concentrations the conjugation and transformation frequencies of args were less than the one of the control when pam levels were low but the case was opposite at the high pam levels the previous literature found that the addition of pam could significantly alter bacterial communities in the wastewater wang et al 2017b majority of args existed in the intracellular forms in this study implying that pam flocculation could alter the leaching efficiencies of args from underlying surface sediments and then affect conjugation and transformation frequencies of args in the leachate to control the risk of args transmission however pam flocculation had little effect on the cell integrity li et al 2016 meanwhile removal efficiencies of pollutants in stormwater runoff through the flocculation were not proportional to pam levels xi et al 2022 too high pam injections had the potential to negatively impact the compression of electrical double layer sun et al 2021 and the risk of releasing pollutants that have already been aggregated song et al 2020 this resulted in the gathering of more bacteria including args hosts and also extracellular free args at high pam levels and created the appropriate conditions for the conjugation and transformation of args but potentially released args or their hosts to increase the risk of transmission flocculation is a low cost harvesting technique for microalgae biomass production but flocculation efficiency was species dependent labeeuw et al 2021 which could be the reason for the different transmission risk of two target args the further intensive work needs to investigate effects of pam on the processes and mechanisms of args leaching 4 conclusions absolute abundances of target args desorption reached at the equilibrium during leaching time of 120 240 min with all of the desorption efficiencies about 30 indicating that there would be low proportion of leaching args in the total args migrating with runoff during rainfall events five target args leaching including inti1 clinic stra strb tetm and tetx can be better described by the pseudo second order equation while qacedelta1 leaching can be better described by the pseudo first order equation and the leaching for both sul1 and sul2 can be well described by the pseudo first order and pseudo second order equations the leaching efficiencies of target args enhanced significantly with the increase of s l ratios and water temperatures but decreased with the increase of ph values both large solar uv irradiation 30 w m2 and high temperature 40 were conducive to conjugation and transformation frequencies of args suggesting the low transmission risk of args leaching from sediments entering into receiving environments through stormwater during the summer periods with intense solar irradiation or high air temperatures furthermore the addition of large cao and medium pam levels could be potential methods blocking args transmission in the leachate from underlying surface sediments the further intensive

15714,recently increasing attention has been paid to antibiotic resistance genes args in urban stormwater runoff however no available literature could be found on args leaching from urban underlying surface sediments during stormwater runoff in this study surface sediments from commercial public squares around nanjing china was selected for the investigation of target args leaching kinetics showing that absolute abundances of target args desorption reached at the equilibrium during leaching time of 120 240min with all of the desorption efficiencies about 30 indicating that there would be low proportion of leaching args in the total args migrating with runoff during rainfall events five target args leaching including inti1 clinic stra strb tetm and tetx can be better described by the pseudo second order equation while qacedelta1 leaching can be better described by the pseudo first order equation and the leaching for both sul1 and sul2 can be well described by the pseudo first order and pseudo second order equations the effects of environmental factors including s l ratios ph values and water temperatures indicated that leaching efficiencies of target args enhanced significantly with the increase of s l ratios and water temperatures but decreased with the increase of ph values the transmission experiments after the simulated solar irradiation and heat implied that both large solar uv irradiation 30w m2 and high temperature 40 were conducive to conjugation and transformation frequencies of args furthermore both high cao and medium pam levels could be effective for blocking args transmission in the leachate from underlying surface sediments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords stormwater runoff road deposited sediments antibiotic resistance genes leaching transmission 1 introduction in recent years diffuse contamination generated by surface runoff has been a key factor in the deterioration of water body quality in urban areas müller et al 2020 which would pose a health risk to downstream receiving water bodies in particular as emerging pollutants antibiotic resistance genes args have been increasingly reported in rainwater runoff garner et al 2017 zuo et al 2022a due to replicability biological characteristics and persistence physical characteristics pachepsky et al 2008 args could spread continuously and survive for a long time in the environment how to reduce args from sources would be one of the effective ways to block its entry into water environment through stormwater runoff the underlying surface sediments like road deposited sediments rds and atmospheric dry and or wet deposition were the direct sources of runoff pollutants baral et al 2018 zhan et al 2020 the previous study reported that underlying surface sediments were the main source of heavy metals in stormwater runoff zuo et al 2012 kim and ko 2021 reported that rds was an important mediator transferring anthropogenic pollutants to stormwater runoff furthermore the content of pollutants in runoff can be determined by the transport process of rainfall runoff on underlying surface sediments for example zafra et al 2017 reported that solid and dissolved fractions contributed 70 7 and 29 3 of the potential heavy metal load washed off by runoff from rds respectively yang et al 2021 claimed that the precipitation pattern strongly impacted rds wash off discharge and removal and the downstream installed green infrastructures reduced the rds induced stormwater pollution by up to 68 however there was no available information about the wash off processes of args from rds into stormwater runoff transport solid fraction and leaching dissolved fraction were two main processes for the underlying surface sediments and their surface pollutants through wash off into stormwater runoff zafra et al 2017 transport was related to rainfall characteristics and particle sizes zhao et al 2016 while leaching on underlying surface sediments was affected by ph and organic matters kim and ko 2021 zhang et al 2016 args in underlying surface sediments will probably enter runoff via the transport because the hosts intracellular args iargs and free dna extracellular args eargs could both adhere to particles mceachran et al 2015 this was proved by the fact that many types of args in stormwater runoff were dominant in particulate matter with size 75 μm like ermf blaoxa1 qnra sul2 zuo et al 2022a and that every gram of sludge dry weight from hospital pharmaceutical industry wastewater treatment plant wwtp and swine manure and sediment in urban lake the potential sources of underlying surface sediments contained from 7 31 103 to 1 16 1010 copies of eargs and from 1 04 105 to 2 74 1012 copies of intracellular args dong et al 2019 however lu et al 2021 found that args could be desorbed from titanium dioxide and zero valent iron indicating that leaching might be one of the potential approaches for arg moving into stormwater runoff at present studies mainly focused on the leaching of conventional pollutants in underlying surface sediment like nitrogen and heavy metals zhang et al 2016 zafra et al 2017 kim and ko 2021 including leaching efficiency kinetics joshi et al 2009 and its contribution to runoff borris et al 2016 there was no available information on args leaching processes from the underlying surface sediments which was one of the keys for args transferring from sediments to runoff the leaching processes were comprised of physical separation and chemical desorption beeston et al 2010 penn et al 2014 and greatly affected by temperature and ph peng et al 2020 meanwhile the previous literature reported that concentrations of particulate matter in stormwater runoff were varying for different rainfall events zuo et al 2011 reflecting the difference in solid s sediments to liquid l stormwater runoff ratios for the leaching processes peng et al 2020 claimed that all leachate i e soluble p fluoride zn pb as and hg extraction concentrations were significantly sensitive to the effect of the s l ratio this indicated that the mentioned factors could affect the leaching processes for both eargs and iargs meanwhile the transduction was the main mechanism of free args transmitting into the receptor bacteria wang et al 2020a resulting in the risk of antibiotic resistance diffusion while iargs in donor bacteria could enter the receptor bacteria through conjugation transfer wang et al 2015 however the risk of args transmission through the leaching from underlying surface sediments is not still clear uv disinfection and heat treatment also had a certain effect on args chu et al 2020 wang et al 2020b which implied that solar irradiation and high temperature might affect args transmission by the leaching under the in situ condition of underlying surface sediments furthermore loganathan et al 2013 reviewed that many of the studies on rds pollutant management dealt with reducing pollutants by road sweeping and water flushing while found to be not very effective this suggested that the risk of leaching induced args transmission could not be controlled by only cleaning on the other hand zheng et al 2019 reported that args removal in municipal sewage sludge by chemical conditioning with polyacrylamide pam or with fe iii and calcium oxide cao thereinto pam can bond particles with small sizes in the process of cleaning and cao was widely used as a fungicide bae et al 2006 hijikataet al 2016 this provided a reference for the control of args risk due to the leaching from underlying surface sediments in this study therefore the underlying surface sediments from commercial public squares in nanjing china with large population densities and frequent human activities were selected to investigate typical args leaching kinetics analyze the effects of environmental factors including s l ratios ph values and water temperatures evaluate transmission risks of leaching args under the simulated solar irradiation and high temperatures and explore the possible control of leaching args transmission by the pretreatment of pam or cao in order to provide a new insight for blocking args transmission from urban commercial areas via stormwater runoff 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites and samples collection nanjing is the largest city in jiangsu province of china and situated in the southwest region it is the capital city of jiangsu province the climate of nanjing is north sub tropical humid with an annual average temperature of 15 3 c and annual precipitation total of 1065 mm the highest intensity of solar uv irradiation is about 30 w m2 with 4 hours of the annual average irradiation time while average intensity of uv irradiation at 10 am 2 pm was in the range of 6 18 w m2 there are 11 districts under its jurisdiction with a population approaching to 10 million and the average population density of the city is 1291 people km2 five square areas 1 1 m were chosen at 13 sampling sites the commercial public square areas ranging from 0 3 0 5 km2 s1 of the supplementary materials during june 7 8 2020 following an average dry weather period of about one week based on local weather forecast for the past three years and our previous study zuo et al 2011 zuo et al 2012 the underlying surface sediment samples were collected using a domestic vacuum cleaner philips fc8516 and brushes sterilized by 75 ethanol weights of the mentioned samples were in the range of 30 90 gram at each square area and a total of 65 samples were collected after the collection sediments were mixed proportionally for the simulated experiments 2 2 the simulated experiments 2 2 1 leaching experiments the leaching or desorption characteristics of args in the mixed sediments were evaluated using 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks as reaction vessels using an orbital shaker with 250 rpm at various time intervals

sampling sites and ph values 5 7 and 9 due to 6 4 8 42 of actual stormwater runoff reported by kim and ko 2021 subsamples of the supernatant were collected after placing 30 min and filtered through a 0 45 μm filter to obtain the leachate 2 2 2 solar irradiation and high temperature based on our previous studies zuo et al 2015 zuo et al 2016 and solar uv irradiation information of sampling sites the 10w black light lamp philips was applied to model solar irradiation and the solar radiation was evaluated in terms of solar uv irradiance which is defined as the rate at which solar radiant energy is incident on a surface per unit area of surface w m2 sichel et a 2007 before experiments the mixed sediments 1g were respectively overlaid onto the 10 cm diameter sterile pyrex crystallizing dishes then the pyrex crystallizing dishes with the sediment was placed on the center under the lamp and the irradiance value at the center of was about 10 20 30 w m2 for 4 h based on solar uv irradiation of sampling sites likewise the mixed sediments 2g were dry heated in an oven at different temperatures 10 25 and 40 of simulated air temperature for 4 h according to the climate of sampling sites after two above treatments the mixed sediments were used to obtain the leachate based on the leaching experiments the initial mixed sediment was used as the control 2 2 3 experiments of risk controls the controls of args leaching risk were evaluated using 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks as reaction vessels using an orbital shaker with 250 rpm at 0 5 h 1g l the mixed sediments and the varying cao doses 1 mg l 5 mg l and 10 mg l or pam doses 1 mg l 5 mg l and 10 mg l based on the previous literatures bae et al 2006 hijikataet al 2016 ding et al 2018 subsamples of the supernatant were collected after placing 30 min and then filtered through a 0 45 μm filter to obtain the leachate the initial mixed sediment was used as the control 2 3 transmission experiments both e coli k 12 with plasmid rp4 carrying tetracycline args and aminoglycoside args and the free plasmid pwh1266 were applied to spike args in the mixed sediments for the transmission experiments conjugation transfer system and experimental conditions were set based on the previous literature lu et al 2018 the donor e coli k 12 and recipient bacteria e coli hb101 carrying streptomycin sulfate resistance were placed in liquid lb and cultured overnight at 37 followed by centrifugation 5 min at 5000 rpm after the centrifugation the supernatants were removed and the residual were washed by phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7 2 and re suspended in calculated volumes of pbs to obtain 1 108 cfu ml bacterial concentrations then the donor and recipient bacteria were mixed at a ratio of 1 1 and treated in the leachate from different experiments for 6 h transformation system and experimental conditions were in line with the one reported by wang et al 2020a firstly pwh1266 plasmid was prepared and suspended in elution buffer 10 mm tris hcl and stored at 80 concentration 210 ng μl 1 ml a baylyi adp1 culture were cultured in 100 ml lb broth overnight at 30 then the 500 μl overnight culture was inoculated into 50 ml liquid lb 1 ml v v in a 100 ml glass bottle when the glass bottle was incubated in a constant temperature shaking incubator at 30 for 6 h the culture reached the early stationary growth stage the od600 was 1 1 the bacterial concentration was 3 108 cfu ml the bacteria were then collected by the centrifugation then precipitated washed and re suspended using the pbs solution the plasmid was added to a baylyi adp1 culture at the final concentration of 0 8 ng μl calculated to 8 34 107 copies μl and then added sodium acetate 100 mg l treated in the leachate from different experiments for 6 h all transmission experiments were processed in triplicate 2 4 leaching kinetics a wide range of models have been used to describe leaching kinetics of args from the mixed sediments inculding pseudo first order model pseudo second order model elovich and power function the corresponding kinetic equations their linear forms as well as the fitting parameters are listed in s2 of the supplementary materials 2 5 analysis methods the high throughput sequencing was consistent with the previous literature zuo and suo 2022b the absolute abundance for both typical args and mobile genetic elements mges in mixed sediments were tested through the smartchip real time pcr systems anhui microanaly gene technology co ltd china including tetracycline resistance genes tetm and tetx aminoglycoside resistance genes stra and strb sulfonamide resistance genes sul1 and sul2 multidrug resistance genes qacedelta1 and inti1 primers information is described in s3 of the supplementary materials detailed procedures are given in test s1 results are reported as absolute abundances of args calculated through multiplying the value of relative gene copy number of args by the absolute copy number of 16s rrna gene xie et al 2016 briefly the absolute abundances of args were obtained in three steps first copy number of each gene on the chip was calculated by the follow equation gene copy number 10 31 ct 10 3 where threshold cycle ct referred to quantitative pcr result and 31 was identified as the detection limit looft et al 2012 second divide the arg copy number on the chip by that of the 16s rrna gene third multiply the value from the second step by the absolute copy numbers of 16s rrna gene the absolute copy numbers of 16s rrna genes were quantified as described previously ouyang et al 2015 all experiments were done in triplicate and then the average of three replicate experiments was calculated and used for data interpretation data analysis graphing was conducted by origin version 8 3 results and discussions 3 1 leaching kinetics the absolute abundances of target args desorption reached at the equilibrium during leaching time of 120 240 min fig 1 with all of the desorption efficiencies about 30 compared with the conventional pollutants zhang et al 2016 kim and ko 2021 leaching efficiencies of these target args were quite low which could be due to the fact that both iargs and eargs could adhere well with particles demaneche et al 2001 wang et al 2019 it indicated that there would be low proportion of leaching args in the total args migrating with runoff during rainfall events however the absolute abundances of these target args were different and still a risk of antibiotic resistance transmission meanwhile the desorption processes of the target args mainly occurred in the first 60 min when all desorption efficiencies got to about 80 of the peak or the desorption equilibrium thereinto the proportion of tetm desorption was the highest with 87 51 it indicated that the potential risk of args in stormwater runoff at the first 60 min could be the highest from the perspective of rainfall duration this was in line with that the impact of runoff on receiving water bodies mainly focused on its initial 30 min the initial effect bakr et al 2020 ding et al 2022 on the other hand there was no correlation for the leaching of the same types of args for example desorption efficiencies of tetm was the largest while the one of tetx was lower with 78 09 based on s4 of the supplementary materials the extracellular tetm abundances were greater than the intracellular tetm abundances in the underlying surface sediments from sampling sites while free dna was easy to be adsorbed by particles mceachran et al 2015 this seemed to be contradictory for the largest desorption efficiencies of tetm the further study of desorption mechanism need to be carried out from the perspective of nucleobase effect hydrophobic interaction and van der waals vdw force li et al 2019 in addition there were different correlations between target args and dominant bacteria in this study zuo and suo 2022b and desorption processes of different bacteria from sediments would not be consistent which also confirmed the differences in the desorption processes of target args fig 1 desorption kinetics could significantly impact the pathway and mechanism of leaching reactions li et al 2019 based on the fitting parameters listed in s5 of the supplementary materials the leaching kinetics of target args could be well described by different kinetic equations five target args including inti1 clinic stra strb tetm and tetx can be better described by the pseudo second order equation indicating that the leaching processes of these args were dominated by chemical desorption mechanism yin et al 2020 but qacedelta1 can be better described by the pseudo first order equation implying that the leaching process of qacedelta1 was dominated by physical diffusion wei et al 2018 sulfonamides resistance genes sul1 and sul2 can be well described by both the pseudo first order and pseudo second order equations illustrating that their leaching processes could consist of both physical diffusion and chemical desorption there were currently many literatures on the dynamics of pollutants in river and lake sediments frachini et al 2021 and soils wei et al 2018 while few literatures could be found on the one in urban underlying surface sediments the only literatures focused on the use of pseudo first and second order equations to simulate heavy metal leaching in urban underlying surface sediments joshi et al 2009 and its impact on urban surface runoff zhang et al 2019 this suggested that there was a certain correlation between desorption kinetics of args and the one of heavy metals in the underlying surface sediments which might be related to the easy bonding of heavy metals and bacteria hosts of args xu et al 2020 3 2 effects of environmental factors 3 2 1 ratios of solid to liquid the leaching efficiencies of target args enhanced significantly with the increase of s l ratios fig 2 where stra had the largest leaching efficiencies with 37 35 under s l ratios of 1 30 which reflected that the increase of runoff volume would result in the more args leaching amount for chemical pollutants the chemical desorption processes are usually short resulting in the low leaching amount in this study the leaching of inti1 clinic stra strb tetm and tetx were determined by chemical desorption but showed different profiles for the effect of s l ratios in particular it was the most obvious for both stra and strb resisting mpicillins the different correlations between target args and dominant bacteria zuo and suo 2022b should be the main reason the previous literature found that bacterial community structure in estuarine sediments was the main driving factor of args variance zhao et al 2020 although no similar studies could be reported in the underlying surface sediments the mentioned relationship could be consistent because bacterial community is the main host of args in the environments on the other hand there was no linear relationship between the leaching efficiencies of target args and s l ratios and the amplification of leaching efficiencies decreased significantly with the increase of s l ratios indicating that there would be limit values for the amount of args leaching into stormwater runoff this was consistent with the influence of s l ratios on the leaching of heavy metals from lignite fly ash darakas et al 2013 firstly bacteria or dna can be hardly dissolved in the solution which is different from conventional chemical pollutants second both intracellular and extracellular dna could be desorbed but also adsorbed barrios et al 2021 and there was the equilibrium between adsorption and desorption the previous literature reported that the equilibrium between adsorption and desorption of dna depended on the physical and chemical properties of the adsorbent and its role relationship with the adsorbate xue and feng 2018 thus the equilibrium between adsorption and desorption for target args in the underlying surface sediments was not determined by s l ratios 3 2 2 water temperatures the leaching efficiencies of target args in the underlying surface sediments gradually increased with the raise of water temperatures fig 3 when water temperature was at 30 the leaching efficiencies for both stra and tetm reached about 41 followed by sul1 sul2 tetx and qacedelta1 with 37 and the lowest was strb with less than 30 it has been proved that the adsorption process was an exothermic process jiang et al 2018 implying that the increase of water temperatures would be not conducive to the adsorption processes meanwhile it is well known that desorption is a process relative to adsorption thus adjusting temperature could change the equilibrium capacity of sediments for args comparing with the effect of s l ratios the linear relationship between leaching efficiencies and water temperature is more obvious with all of the correlation coefficient r2 greater than 0 95 in addition the 30 of water temperature in this study agreed with the actual situation although the used water temperature can be higher 3 2 3 ph values the leaching of target args in the underlying surface sediments gradually decreased with the increase of ph values fig 4 under acidic conditions the leaching efficiencies of target args were the highest where the one of tetm was 58 88 and that of strb was 34 76 while leaching efficiencies of other args were between 40 and 50 under alkaline conditions target args leaching efficiencies were all not more than 20 it indicated that the amount of args leaching into runoff was less than the one migrating into runoff with particles which was coincident with that iargs was found to be dominant in this study s4 of the supplementary materials the lowest ph values of rainwater provide the optimal conditions for leaching of particle bound pollutants such as heavy metals wang et al 2017a the conventional pollutants like nitrogen phosphorus and organic matter were easier to leach from sewage sludge batziaka et al 2008 as the increase of ph values the cation exchange after protonation of dna molecules but also at higher ph values probably by hydrogen bridges between cooal or coofe groups of humic substances and the rnh2 groups of dna was the main mechanism for dna adsorption crecchio et al 2005 the more args leaching at low ph could be due to the fact that adsorption processes are opposite to desorption processes and the found that the desorption kinetics in this study was mainly chemical desorption meanwhile there was a certain linear relationship between args leaching from the underlying surface sediments and ph values and the correlation coefficients were all greater than 0 97 suggesting the significant effect of ph values 3 3 transmission risks of leaching args 3 3 1 transmission after the simulated solar irradiation solar uv irradiation could kill a range of antibiotic resistant s aureus e coli and k pneumoniae when they were subjected for 4 h giannakis et al 2018 but the dosage of uv did not guarantee the complete inactivation of args because uv had no lasting residual disinfection ability and there may be photoreactivation and dark repair limiting the effectiveness of uv disinfection zhang et al 2020 in this study conjugation frequencies for both tetracycline resistance genes and aminoglycoside resistance genes were found to decrease fig 5 compared to the one without the simulated solar irradiation the control thereinto conjugation frequencies of tetracycline resistance genes at uv dose 10 w m2 agreed with that at uv dose 20 w m2 while greatly reduced at uv dose 30 w m2 the conjugation frequencies of aminoglycoside resistance genes were obvious inversely proportional to uv doses there was effective removal of args only when the dose of uv exceeded 100 mj cm2 zhang et al 2020 meanwhile guo and kong 2019 claimed that even 1 mj cm2 uv disinfection can significantly decrease the conjugative transfer frequency of the survival bacteria however wang et al 2020b reported that until uv dosage enhanced to 320 mj cm2 args achieved 0 58 1 60 log removal furthermore uv disinfection increased the potential health risk of args in wastewater jia et al 2021 in this study uv dose was much higher than the one reported by the mentioned literatures but there was still a risk of transmission which could be attributed to the bacterial dna repair suss et al 2009 after uv irradiation meanwhile the simulated solar irradiation in this study was different from the individual uvc irradiation although uvc irradiation could damage the genome of microorganisms to hinder replication oguma and rattanakul 2021 in addition zhang et al 2017 claimed that uv disinfection caused a selective change in the inhibition zone diameters of surviving antibiotic resistant e coli and a slight damage to args however transformation frequencies of tetracycline resistance genes could be found to increase at varying degrees under different uv doses compared with the control which could be also due to bacterial dna repair suss et al 2009 after uv irradiation in all there would be the low transmission risk of args leaching from sediments entering into receiving environments through stormwater during the summer periods with intense solar irradiation 3 3 2 transmission after the simulated heat results from fig 6 showed that profiles of target args conjugation frequencies with the increase of the simulated air temperature were similar to the one of args transformation frequencies where their highest reached at 25 but the conjugation frequencies for args were the lowest at 10 and also decreased at 40 while transformation frequency of args was the lowest at 40 this indicated that high temperature weather could be conducive to reduce the transmission risk of args in the leachate from the underlying surface sediments which was consistent with the effect of temperature during composting for example directly raising temperature can decrease mefa and tetw relative abundances during storage of manure slurries li et al 2020 similarly the significant reduction of args in heated piles was observed in the first trial staley et al 2021 however the leaching efficiencies of target args in the underlying surface sediments gradually increased with the increase of water temperature which was in line with air temperatures zuo et al 2012 since the quantitative relationship of args leaching amount with air temperature was still uncertain it was not clear whether high temperature can reduce the transmission risks of args leaching from the underlying surface sediments caused by stormwater at present studies about args transmission are mainly focused on the use of simulated target args in laboratory conditions which added great difficulty to analyze the mentioned quantitative relationship future work should be the breakthrough of transmission mechanism under complex environment conditions including the underlying surface sediments 3 4 transmission controlled by cao or pam two tentative pathways that might be applicable to control the transmission risk of args leaching from underlying surface sediments are presented in fig 7 where the conjugation frequencies in the leachate decreased with the increase of cao concentrations the conjugation frequencies of the two args were 22 35 and 39 68 of the control group respectively when cao concentration reached 10 mg l indicating cao was one of the potential methods blocking args conjugation in the leachate from underlying surface sediments previous literatures focused on the sterilization by the use of cao for instance all three bacteria were not greatly affected by cao solutions at concentrations of 0 01 and 0 03 however the decline of e coli 99 2 78 log cfu ml l monocytogrens 45 1 44 log cfu ml and s typhimurium 70 2 08 log cfu ml was greatest when they were exposed to 0 05 cao solution for 10 min bae et al 2006 similarly an increasing concentration of cao significantly reduced the microbial population compared with the control kang and bin song 2017 meanwhile the alkaline treated compost with cao or ash resulted primarily in damage to the outer membrane and enzyme activities of e coli hijikata et al 2016 these could be responsible for the decrease in conjugation frequencies from cao treatment in addition increased cao concentration would lead to an increase of ph values especially alkaline ph in the leachate which further caused the decrease of args leaching efficiencies in this study and then prevented the transmission risk of args leaching from underlying surface sediments through stormwater on the other hand compared with the control there were different profiles about conjugation and transformation frequencies of args in the leachate under the treatment of varying pam concentrations the conjugation and transformation frequencies of args were less than the one of the control when pam levels were low but the case was opposite at the high pam levels the previous literature found that the addition of pam could significantly alter bacterial communities in the wastewater wang et al 2017b majority of args existed in the intracellular forms in this study implying that pam flocculation could alter the leaching efficiencies of args from underlying surface sediments and then affect conjugation and transformation frequencies of args in the leachate to control the risk of args transmission however pam flocculation had little effect on the cell integrity li et al 2016 meanwhile removal efficiencies of pollutants in stormwater runoff through the flocculation were not proportional to pam levels xi et al 2022 too high pam injections had the potential to negatively impact the compression of electrical double layer sun et al 2021 and the risk of releasing pollutants that have already been aggregated song et al 2020 this resulted in the gathering of more bacteria including args hosts and also extracellular free args at high pam levels and created the appropriate conditions for the conjugation and transformation of args but potentially released args or their hosts to increase the risk of transmission flocculation is a low cost harvesting technique for microalgae biomass production but flocculation efficiency was species dependent labeeuw et al 2021 which could be the reason for the different transmission risk of two target args the further intensive work needs to investigate effects of pam on the processes and mechanisms of args leaching 4 conclusions absolute abundances of target args desorption reached at the equilibrium during leaching time of 120 240 min with all of the desorption efficiencies about 30 indicating that there would be low proportion of leaching args in the total args migrating with runoff during rainfall events five target args leaching including inti1 clinic stra strb tetm and tetx can be better described by the pseudo second order equation while qacedelta1 leaching can be better described by the pseudo first order equation and the leaching for both sul1 and sul2 can be well described by the pseudo first order and pseudo second order equations the leaching efficiencies of target args enhanced significantly with the increase of s l ratios and water temperatures but decreased with the increase of ph values both large solar uv irradiation 30 w m2 and high temperature 40 were conducive to conjugation and transformation frequencies of args suggesting the low transmission risk of args leaching from sediments entering into receiving environments through stormwater during the summer periods with intense solar irradiation or high air temperatures furthermore the addition of large cao and medium pam levels could be potential methods blocking args transmission in the leachate from underlying surface sediments the further intensive work needs to investigate the mechanisms of args leaching during stomwater runoff declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or
