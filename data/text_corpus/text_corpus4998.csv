24990,widespread land use change in coastal ecosystems has led to a decline in the amount of habitat available for fish and wildlife lower production of ecosystem goods and services and loss of recreational and aesthetic value this has prompted global efforts to restore the natural hydrologic regimes of developed shorelines especially resource rich estuaries but the resilience of these restored ecosystems in the face of accelerated sea level rise slr remains uncertain we implemented a monitoring based simulation of accretion in coastal estuaries mosaics in r statistical software to address uncertainty in the resilience of modified estuarine habitats using the nisqually river delta in the pacific northwest usa as a case study mosaics is a spatially explicit model with a numerical foundation that uses empirical monitoring datasets to forecast habitat change in response to rising tidal levels because it accounts for the crucial ecomorphodynamic feedbacks between tidal inundation vegetative growth and sediment accretion mosaics can be used to determine whether alternative management scenarios such as enhanced sediment inputs will bolster estuarine resilience to slr under moderate slr 0 62 m the model predicted that a two fold increase in mean daily suspended sediment during the rainy season was sufficient to maintain nisqually s emergent marshes through 2100 but under high slr 1 35 m mosaics indicated that greater sediment additions would be necessary to prevent submergence a comparison between a restored marsh with subsided and high elevation areas and a relict marsh demonstrated that the subsided restoration area was highly susceptible to slr findings from the mosaics model highlight the importance of a site s initial elevation capacity for producing above and belowground biomass and suspended sediment availability when considering management actions in estuaries and other coastal ecosystems keywords estuarine habitat mosaic hierarchical model scenario analysis sea level rise sediment accretion tidal wetlands 1 introduction estuaries and their associated tidal marshes connect freshwater riverine ecosystems to the open ocean thereby playing a critical role in supporting marine ecosystem function mclusky and elliot 2004 beaumont et al 2007 they supply valuable economic cultural and ecological goods and services including habitat for fish waterbirds and mammals simenstad and cordell 2000 greenberg et al 2006 barbier et al 2011 consequently their preservation is a priority for coastal management over the coming century global sea level rise slr is expected to diminish the extent of coastal wetlands by as much as 90 converting productive tidal marshes into subtidal habitat nicholls et al 1999 galbraith et al 2002 craft et al 2009 crosby et al 2016 shoreline armoring levees and dams further compound the threat of slr by removing many estuaries from tidal influence preventing them from migrating inland and reducing sediment accretion kirwan and murray 2008 jackson 2010 major efforts are underway to eliminate unnecessary barriers to tidal exchange but restored estuaries are often subject to degradation which can reduce their resilience to slr and other natural hazards callaway et al 2007 vandenbruwaene et al 2011 historically estuarine tidal marshes have been able to counter the effects of slr via an ecomorphodynamic feedback cycle whereby tidal inundation vegetative growth and sediment accumulation allow the marsh plain to keep pace with gradually increasing tidal levels kirwan et al 2010 french 2006 fitzgerald et al 2008 specifically marsh vegetation traps suspended sediment and slows the flow of water across the marsh surface thereby facilitating sediment deposition and accretion d alpaos et al 2007 2011 habitat degradation due to disturbance development or management actions may inhibit this feedback cycle by facilitating erosion hindering sediment delivery or limiting above and belowground productivity syvitski et al 2009 vandenbruwaene et al 2011 burdick and roman 2012 practitioners can augment the capacity of at risk tidal marshes to respond to disturbance i e their resilience through the physical modification of sedimentation and subsidence rates but there are often ecological physical or demographic limitations to the continued stability of estuarine habitat kirwan and megonigal 2013 given these limitations practitioners may benefit from a decision support tool that uses empirical data to identify vulnerable areas in a restored or degraded estuary predicts changes to the estuarine habitat mosaic and simulates the effects of alternative management scenarios given projected estimates of slr marsh accretion models can be used as decision support tools to help managers determine a target estuary s long term resilience there is considerable breadth in the type and utility of marsh accretion models rybczyk and callaway 2009 mcleod et al 2010 ranging from generalized numerical equations and simplified inundation simulations titus and richman 2001 kirwan et al 2010 to spatially explicit process based models schile et al 2014 morris et al 2016 thorne et al 2018 at present tradeoffs between accuracy and simplicity have opened a niche for habitat change models that combine a transparent numerical foundation with localized empirical data such as that commonly collected in wetland monitoring programs a similar approach has already been used to predict water temperature morrill et al 2005 sharma et al 2008 phytoplankton productivity joint and groom 2000 barnes et al 2011 marsh vegetation sanderson et al 2001 tidal channel formation hibma et al 2004 and organic and inorganic sediment accretion swanson et al 2014 morris et al 2016 in a variety of freshwater and marine ecosystems thus there is reason to believe that the combined use of existing monitoring datasets with numerical models may also be suitable for predicting estuarine habitat response to slr this study evaluates the effects of rising tidal levels and modified sediment management strategies on estuarine habitat by developing a monitoring based simulation of accretion in coastal estuaries mosaics we calibrated and tested mosaics in r statistical software r core development team 2017 using seven years of post restoration monitoring data from the nisqually river delta nrd in southern puget sound washington usa ellings et al 2016 woo et al 2018 the nrd is a macro tidal system comprised of a diverse habitat mosaic of upland tidal forests freshwater brackish and saline emergent marshes and intertidal mudflats these attributes make it an ideal case study to evaluate habitat resilience to slr and resultant changes in habitat distribution among historically managed and unaltered relict areas restoration actions conducted between 1996 and 2009 were led by billy frank jr nisqually national wildlife refuge hereafter refuge and the nisqually indian tribe hereafter tribe the restored marshes have provided ample foraging and roosting sites for economically valuable waterbirds and crucial nursery habitat for juvenile chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha ellings et al 2016 davis et al 2018 woo et al 2018 listed under the endangered species act as such state federal and tribal managers have a vested interest in maintaining the current extent of wetland habitat over the coming century here we describe our steps in constructing validating and evaluating mosaics which we used to evaluate long term habitat trajectories in a subsided restoration area a higher elevation restoration area and a relict tidal marsh our overarching objectives for this study were 1 develop an empirical model to project long term trajectories of elevation change and habitat distribution 2 manipulate tidal level and sediment input parameters to determine how management scenarios may influence the estuarine habitat mosaic under impending slr and 3 compare estimated changes in the habitat mosaic for restored and relict sites we anticipated that subsided restoration areas would exhibit less resilience to rising sea levels than the relict marsh due to lower initial elevations and a lack of vegetative biomass morris et al 2002 our approach demonstrates how monitoring data can play a crucial role in modeling efforts and can be used as part of a decision support tool to gauge the resilience of restored estuaries in the face of climate change 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the nisqually river originates from glacial discharge at the southwestern base of mount rainier washington usa from there the river meanders 130 km northward where it empties into puget sound between the cities of olympia and tacoma 47 08 n 122 70 w forming a large river delta with an areal extent of approximately 20 km2 between 1904 and 2009 roughly 5 km2 of the delta s marshes were diked or leveed for agriculture resulting in habitat loss for a variety of fish and wildlife species agricultural practices including the drying of wetland soils led to peat degradation and subsidence with elevations behind the dikes subsiding up to 1 5 m lower than the surrounding marsh plain in 2009 the refuge removed 8 km of dikes on the west side of the river restoring over 3 km2 of subsided marsh to tidal influence restored refuge fig 1 this major restoration project along with several smaller restorations carried out by the tribe on the east side of the river in 1996 pilot 2002 phase i and 2006 phase ii restored east represents the largest composite estuary restoration in puget sound to date as of publication the restored refuge sits at 0 2 m above mean tidal level mtl 1 34 m navd88 while restored east is generally higher in elevation 1 3 m above mtl islands of relict salt marsh relict marsh bound both restoration areas to the north and west and are characterized by vegetated platforms 1 3 m above mtl incised by a fractal network of tidal channels in addition to its restored and relict marshes the nrd consists of a diverse habitat mosaic including upland forests freshwater and brackish tidal wetlands intertidal mudflats eelgrass zostera marina beds and nearshore subtidal areas belleveau et al 2015 ballanti et al 2017 davenport et al 2017 appendix a a tidal range of more than 6 m during spring tides and frequent storm events throughout the autumn rainy season ensure that much of this mosaic is inundated at high tide the nrd was originally formed by infrequent volcanic events such as lahar flows pringle and scott 2001 but regular inputs of inorganic sediment are crucial for maintaining the current extent and configuration of estuarine habitat each year spring snow melt and autumn rainfall carry sediment to the nrd where it is deposited or carried away by tidal currents in 1945 construction of the alder lagrande dam complex was completed at river kilometer 65 trapping more than 42 million m3 of sediment czuba et al 2012a curran et al 2016 as a result the current quantity that is transported to the mouth of the nisqually river is low compared to other similarly sized puget sound rivers czuba et al 2011 various tributaries feed into the main stem below the dam but it is estimated that only 10 of the primary sediment load generated upstream reaches the mouth of the river nelson 1974 czuba et al 2012a consequently it is important to consider the interplay between depleted inorganic sediment inputs and changing tidal regimes when assessing the response of the nrd to rising tidal levels 2 2 data collection post restoration monitoring efforts were conducted throughout the nrd in 2010 2017 as part of a larger comprehensive monitoring plan we collected data throughout restored and relict marshes with varying levels of freshwater and tidal input fig 1 tables 1 and 2 when possible we targeted sampling sites adjacent to tidal sloughs such that geomorphological and biological datasets overlapped spatially we did not include sampling sites in areas that had been removed from tidal influence including freshwater wetlands within the new dike or wetlands to the south of the i 5 highway barrier all relevant datasets contributing to the construction and validation of mosaics are described in detail in sections 2 2 1 2 2 5 2 2 1 water level we used barometrically compensated water level data collected from a solinst ltc level logger located in a relict marsh channel fig 1 to quantify inundation duration and calculate a tidal datum data were logged continuously at 6 12 or 15 minute intervals between february 2010 and january 2015 and were converted from water level m to vertical elevation m navd88 based on real time kinematic global positioning system rtk gps measured sensor height ellings et al 2016 we used the complete dataset to calculate a tidal datum for the nrd mtl for the estuary was 1 34 m with a mean high water level mhw of 2 82 m a mean higher high water level mhhw of 3 11 m a mean low water level mlw of 0 11 m and a mean lower low water level mllw of 1 00 m for study purposes mhhw was calculated as the average height of the highest tide recorded by the water logger each day between 2010 and 2015 while mllw was the average height of the lowest daily tide 2 2 2 vegetation surveys to estimate and model aboveground vegetative biomass we conducted vegetation surveys at 30 sites in september 2009 2015 fig 1 at each site we measured mean percent cover canopy height and stem density for all species observed within a 0 25 m2 sampling quadrat we sampled three quadrats per site at locations 0 20 and 40 m from the edge of an adjacent tidal slough to account for spatial variation in sediment distribution we also noted local habitat characteristics such as water depth and overhead canopy cover associated soil pore salinity values psu were obtained for each surveyed quadrat by drawing out moisture from the top layer of marsh sediment and analyzing the extracted water with a refractometer belowground biomass was not measured and thus could not be included as a model parameter despite evidence that it may contribute to organic matter deposition and stabilization of the marsh plain nyman et al 1993 turner et al 2004 kirwan and guntenspergen 2012 2 2 3 elevation change we measured elevation change through time at a precision of up to 1 mm using deep rod surface elevation tables sets cahoon et al 2002 located at 14 restored and relict marsh sites fig 1 we took an initial set measurement immediately after the restoration in september 2009 and collected yearly measurements every spring thereafter through april 2017 feldspar horizon markers and sediment pins adjacent to each set were used to measure corresponding sediment accretion rates although due to scouring and obvious sediment redistribution at the northwest corner of the restored refuge horizon markers were not considered to be an accurate measure of sediment deposition at these sites 2 2 4 suspended sediment because we did not collect empirical measurements of suspended sediment we used a regression model to estimate sediment load to the nrd curran et al 2016 l 0 00199 q 2 68 b c f where l is suspended sediment load in metric tons per day t d q is river discharge in cubic meters per second m3 s and bcf is a bias correction factor equal to 1 17 we obtained daily mean discharge estimates from a combination of water data reports and publicly available water quality data https waterdata usgs gov nwis these data were then converted to mean daily suspended sediment loads using the transport curve equation for total yearly inputs and for the rainy season october march intra annual variation was accounted for in the model such that the sediment term was randomly generated from a log normal distribution for each time step based on mean daily suspended sediment concentrations during the rainy season 300 100 t d 2 2 5 spatial data we used a 3 m resolution bare earth digital elevation model dem acquired from airborne topographic lidar collected in january 2011 watershed sciences inc portland oregon usa to determine initial elevation values for the spatially explicit model these data were validated to a measured vertical accuracy of 3 cm using rtk gps and boat mounted bathymetric surveys we hand digitized channels and other water features on georeferenced aerial imagery flown in summer 2011 bergman photographic services inc portland oregon usa ellings et al 2016 we derived several spatial datasets using the 2011 dem for each 3 3 m cell we analyzed least cost path distances to the delta at mtl i e marsh edge the nearest freshwater source nisqually river or mcallister creek and the nisqually river main stem using the path distance tool in arcgis 10 3 software esri inc redlands california usa we used the euclidean distance tool in arcgis to measure the straight line distance between each cell and the edge of the nearest tidal channel all spatial datasets were georeferenced to the wgs84 coordinate system 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 model structure and parameterization the mosaics model and decision support tool has a hierarchical structure based on multiple numerical models that recognize the interdependency of inundation duration vegetative biomass sediment availability and elevation change in tidal marshes morris et al 2002 temmerman et al 2003 d alpaos et al 2007 kirwan and murray 2007 fig 2 these models have shown that elevation change is an additive product of allochthonous mineral sediment settling on the marsh surface esed sediment captured by vegetation ecap autochthonous organic matter deposition eorg tidal erosive forces eer and compaction d alpaos et al 2011 compaction and settling are generally assumed to have minimal effects on elevation change in most tidal marshes french 1993 2006 but see morris et al 2016 while the geological processes of subsidence and uplift egeo can significantly impact elevations at longer timescales verdonck 2006 using the set data we modeled elevation change δe as an iterative yearly time step t for each raster cell x y with inundation duration i aboveground vegetative biomass v and suspended sediment l as primary drivers we applied a maximum likelihood estimation procedure with the bbmle package in r 3 4 1 bolker 2017 to parameterize each equation using the empirical monitoring datasets described in section 2 2 to model elevation change through time we used an autoregressive framework based on d alpaos et al 2011 1 e t 1 x y e t x y δ e t x y 2 δ e t x y e s e d e c a p e o r g e e r e g e o with the assumption that esed is dependent upon sediment and inundation ecap is dependent upon sediment inundation and vegetation eorg is dependent upon vegetation eer is dependent upon inundation and egeo is constant for the entire study area 0 5 mm yr verdonck 2006 fig 2 suspended sediment concentrations decay exponentially with distance from the sediment source stumpf 1983 christiansen et al 2000 because we did not have spatially explicit data for suspended sediment we used position on the marsh plain in relation to tidal channels as a proxy for spatial variation in sediment distribution which is broadly recognized to influence accretion rates christiansen et al 2000 d alpaos et al 2007 li and yang 2009 specifically we modeled suspended sediment as a linear function of a cell s path distance from the nisqually river main stem riv and as an exponentially decreasing function of its euclidean distance from the nearest tidal channel edge chan the relationship between elevation change and inundation was modeled as an exponential decay function increasing form based on a preliminary analysis of the sediment pin and horizon marker data showing that esed leveled off asymptotically with increasing inundation duration thus the mathematical form of each component was 3 e s e d l t 1 e i a i t x y i n t 1 r a r i v x y c a e c b c h a n x y 4 e c a p l t v t x y 1 e i b i t x y i n t 2 r b r i v x y c d e c e c h a n x y 5 e o r g v a v t x y 6 e e r i c e i d i t x y 1 the interactive terms of the model were structured such that when l or i were zero elevation change was dependent solely on organic matter accumulation eorg when v was zero elevation change was dependent exclusively on mineral sedimentation and erosive forces esed eer and when all three were zero only geologic uplift and subsidence egeo affected yearly elevation change we parameterized the full model for δe using the set data the egeo constant was not included in the model parameterization process because such geologic processes were not directly measured by the sets the inputs for inundation duration and aboveground vegetative biomass were expressed as their own set of hierarchical equations we modeled the relationship between inundation duration and surface elevation as a cumulative distribution of the proportion of time a cell of elevation e was submerged by the tide during a given year t bockelmann et al 2002 temmerman et al 2003 to incorporate changing sea levels we used elevation relative to mtl assuming mtl stayed relatively constant at 1 34 m navd88 between 2010 and 2015 we parameterized a cumulative distribution function on incrementally increasing elevation values representing the full range of elevations observed for the nisqually estuary 1 3 5 m relative to mtl 7 i t x y 1 1 a e b e t x y 1 c the function was given a lower asymptote of 0 and an upper asymptote of 1 to limit i to proportional values and the model was fit to the data by parameterizing a b and c we modeled total aboveground vegetative biomass as a function of inundation duration and soil pore salinity s while we did not explicitly measure aboveground biomass using the vegetation quadrats it is calculable as a function of several structural parameters including stem density per unit area and mean plant height morris and haskin 1990 thursby et al 2002 we calculated per area standing biomass g m2 for each species j observed in a sampling quadrat using the equation vj 0 04njhj where nj is the species extrapolated stem density per m2 and hj is its average stem height this equation was based on literature values and observed height biomass relationships for carex lyngbyei distichlis spicata and salicornia pacifica byrd et al 2017 2018 the sum across all observed species was considered the total estimated vegetative biomass value for a given sampling quadrat and was used as our input dataset for parameterizing v we modeled vegetative biomass as a gaussian function with respect to inundation duration this was reflective of the polynomial relationship for halophilic marsh plants demonstrated by morris et al 2002 and janousek et al 2016 showing that productivity increases with greater elevations relative to mtl but then starts to decrease again at a threshold height we chose a gaussian equation to keep biomass above zero for the full range of inundation duration values 0 1 we also included an interaction effect with soil pore salinity because exploratory data analyses determined that biomass decreased with increasing soil salinities leveling off around 50 psu our final model for predicting v was 8 v t x y n e δ s t x y e i t x y μ 2 2 σ 2 where i was determined from eq 7 s was determined from eq 9 below and n δ μ and σ were shape parameters estimates of soil pore salinity were necessary to calculate vegetative biomass and to identify different estuarine habitat types soil salinity is governed by several environmental factors including the frequency and duration of tidal inundation distance from the nearest source of freshwater and distance from the marsh edge odum 1988 moffett et al 2010 high elevation marshes tend to be more saline than low elevation marshes because evapotranspiration and infrequent tidal flushing can lead to the accumulation of salt within the soil callaway et al 2007 while sites closer to riverine freshwater inputs tend to have lower salinities an exploratory analysis suggested that the relationships between soil pore salinity inundation and a site s position on the marsh plain were highly complex so we used an information theoretic approach to compare several non linear candidate models for s appendix b an exponential decay function was used to define the asymptotic relationship between soil pore salinity and distance from the river main stem and several additive and interactive functions including distance from the marsh edge mar and inundation duration were tested we parameterized each candidate model using maximum likelihood estimation and selected the best fit model using akaike s information criterion aic burnham and anderson 2002 we determined the best fit model structure to be 9 s t x y α β m a r x y c γ i t x y 1 e k r i v x y where i was ascertained using eq 7 and α β γ c and k were shape parameters our final step was to classify a given cell as a specific estuarine habitat type given model outputs h for each time step in most estuaries habitat type is primarily related to inundation duration and soil pore salinity and is generally defined by the vegetation species occupying a particular tract of the marsh plain species tolerances for inundation regimes and soil pore salinity can vary widely among regions and among estuaries pennings et al 2005 silvestri et al 2005 so we used vegetation survey data and a clustering algorithm to define inundation and salinity ranges for each habitat type detailed methods along with a list of plant species observed in each habitat type are outlined in appendix a we applied mosaics to the nrd by calculating i s v δe and h iteratively on an annual time step for each 3 3 m cell the 2011 dem was used for our initial elevation values and the spatial datasets described in section 2 2 5 were used as measurements of riv mar and chan all spatially explicit model analyses were conducted with the rgdal and raster packages in r bivand et al 2019 hijmans 2019 2 3 2 model validation to validate the elevation change model we conducted a sensitivity analysis using parameter space estimation in the r package pse we varied predictor variables over a range of uniformly or normally distributed realistic values including inundation duration i 0 1 suspended sediment input l mean sd 300 100 t d vegetative biomass v 0 5 000 g m2 path distance to the nisqually river riv 0 2 000 m and euclidean distance to the nearest channel edge chan 0 300 m we produced 3d surface plots of model output when parameter space was manipulated for two variables at a time to discern each variable s distinct influence on annual elevation change mm the autoregressive structure of mosaics meant that model error was potentially propagated through time we conducted a second longitudinal sensitivity analysis where elevation change was simulated through time 2011 2100 for a single hypothetical cell under present day slr we tested initial elevations e0 of 1 0 1 2 and 3 m relative to mtl while riv was held constant at 550 m mar was held constant at 550 m chan was held constant at 30 m and l was set to 300 t d we varied i s v and δe by 1 root mean squared error rmse as a percentage of the full range of observed values rmse was determined from the maximum likelihood estimation procedure for model eqs 7 9 8 and 2 respectively table 3 2 3 3 management scenarios we used mosaics as a decision support tool to determine how slr in the nrd might affect the elevation and habitat composition of its restored and relict marshes through the year 2100 scenarios included present day slr 2 mm yr or 0 18 m by 2100 bromirski et al 2011 moderate slr 0 62 m by 2100 nrc 2012 and high slr 1 35 m by 2100 where mtl was adjusted accordingly for rates of change additionally we tested several management scenarios for increasing the delivery and retention of suspended sediment in river deltas including raising initial elevations through dredging or sediment augmentation periodic riverine sediment pulses via altered reservoir practices and dam removal nrc 2011 present day 2009 2016 mean suspended sediment loads for the nrd range from 5 35 t d during the summer to 100 550 t d during the rainy season with peaks of up to 10 000 t d during major storm events curran et al 2016 to simulate periodic sediment loads we introduced spikes in suspended sediment 1 000 t d once every 10 years to test the effects of a gradual increase in sediment delivery i e through altered reservoir practices we increased annual suspended sediment inputs two fold from an average of 300 t d to 600 t d during the rainy season assuming lower summer discharge and sediment concentrations would have less of an effect on sediment accretion on an annual time scale to simulate unrestrained sediment input i e dam removal we increased mean seasonal sediment loads from 300 t d to 3 000 t d based on an estimated dam trap efficiency of 90 and an estimated river retention rate of roughly 50 czuba et al 2012a we also tested a scenario where we raised initial elevations across the delta by 0 5 m although realistically this strategy would only be viable at smaller spatial scales we tested each sediment input scenario in tandem with moderate and high estimates of slr nrc 2012 to determine whether additional suspended sediment could mitigate potential habitat loss 3 results 3 1 model structure and validation we successfully parameterized each hierarchical component of mosaics i s v δe using the empirical datasets tables 1 and 2 model rmse was less than 16 of the range of observed values for each component table 3 for δe the parameters rb in the sediment capture equation ecap and va in the organic matter deposition equation eorg converged on zero so they were omitted from the final model this meant that eorg essentially had no effect on elevation change in the nrd contrary to previous observations of 45 organic matter content in relict marsh sediments see drexler et al 2019 instead inorganic sediments esed were the predominant contributor to annual elevation change for all scenarios although erosive processes eer negated this contribution in areas that were inundated more than 50 of the time sediment capture by vegetation ecap augmented annual elevation change by 0 70 within the range of marsh plant inundation tolerances with peak contributions at an inundation duration of approximately 12 as such the greatest accretion rates were predicted to occur in areas that were inundated between 2 and 23 of the time the parameter space estimation procedure showed that most predicted model outcomes fell between 1 and 15 mm yr a realistic albeit conservative estimate based on annual observed set readings which ranged between 58 mm and 90 mm yr mean sd restored refuge 4 91 20 07 mm yr restored east 6 91 6 43 mm yr relict marsh 2 45 4 36 mm yr the sensitivity analysis also found that each predictor variable differed with respect to its relative effects on marsh accretion rates partial rank correlation coefficients indicated that positive accretion rates were more likely to occur farther from the nisqually river mean se prcc 0 90 0 02 and with greater suspended sediment loads 0 68 0 04 while negative accretion rates were more likely to occur in areas farther from tidal channels 0 37 0 05 vegetative biomass had a moderately positive relationship with increasing marsh elevations 0 31 0 04 three dimensional surfaces produced from a pairwise manipulation of parameter space supported these findings and highlighted parameter values that were more likely to produce unrealistic model output fig 3 in addition to error that was potentially introduced by the spatial inputs riv chan the longitudinal sensitivity analysis determined that model error was propagated through time however it appeared to have only a marginal effect regardless of a site s initial elevation the rmse of the inundation component was only 0 015 which was 1 5 of the total range of observed values 0 1 as such the inclusion of such minor error had little effect on the model output than would otherwise be expected based on year to year variance in the sediment term fig 4 unremarkable findings were also observed for soil pore salinity and vegetation despite higher rmse 15 the only component for which the propagation of error appeared to be a concern was for annual elevation change where the inclusion of error resulted in a 5 35 decrease rmse or 3 13 increase rmse in the final predicted elevation depending on initial elevation e0 3 2 present day conditions for the first decade after restoration 2011 2020 mosaics forecasted varying rates of elevation change throughout the delta with an overall trend toward elevation gain relative to mtl in the restored refuge 0 027 0 026 m restored east 0 042 0 047 m and relict marsh sites 0 049 0 051 m the model classified the 2011 estuarine habitat mosaic as 43 2 subtidal 6 4 eelgrass 11 3 intertidal mudflats 16 4 low elevation salt marsh 5 4 mid elevation salt marsh 8 7 high elevation salt marsh 4 9 brackish marsh 0 3 freshwater marsh and 3 5 upland habitat fig 5 the most notable changes in habitat distribution between 2011 and 2020 were observed in the intertidal mudflats 0 5 mid elevation salt marsh 1 1 and high elevation salt marsh 1 7 with zero change in the extent of low elevation salt marsh freshwater and upland habitats 3 3 management scenarios without additional suspended sediment inputs mosaics projected that mean elevation relative to mtl would increase by 0 38 m in the restored refuge 0 37 m at restored east and 0 43 m in the relict marsh by 2100 under present rates of slr fig 6 this scenario led to a 225 increase in the areal extent of upland habitat a 25 decrease in mudflat and an 18 decrease low salt marsh which was primarily driven by the egeo parameter fig 7 table 4 under moderate slr predicted elevations at all sites increased through 2050 before succumbing to rising tidal levels in 2100 as a result elevation relative to mtl decreased by 0 12 m in the restored refuge and 0 02 m at restored east while elevations increased slightly by 0 04 m in the relict marsh in this scenario upland habitat decreased to half its current areal extent as it was converted to high salt marsh and brackish marsh along the edge of the nisqually river the highest modeled rates of slr resulted in substantial submergence of marsh habitat throughout the nrd all three study areas experienced sharp declines in elevation especially during the latter half of the century the modeled elevation of the restored refuge decreased by 0 78 m meaning it was inundated for 57 of the average tidal cycle the elevations of restored east and relict marsh declined by 0 63 m and 0 56 m respectively this led to delta wide losses of low mid and high salt marsh brackish marsh and upland habitats predicted salt marsh submergence was especially noticeable in the restored refuge where almost all the low salt marsh was converted to intertidal mudflat by 2100 and only small swaths of high and brackish marsh remained along the edge of the nisqually river output from mosaics indicated that raising the initial marsh plain by 0 5 m effectively buffered against slr in the restored marshes under moderate slr mean elevations were 0 65 m higher than present day conditions in the restored refuge and 0 41 m higher at restored east by the year 2100 fig 6 delta wide the extent of high marsh was doubled while low and mid salt marsh declined by 54 and 18 respectively fig 7 table 4 in 2100 the predominant habitat type predicted for both restoration areas was high salt marsh with intermittent patches of brackish marsh and upland habitat when high slr rates were used in the model the 0 5 m elevation buffer was predicted to be enough to ensure that much of the subsided restored refuge was not submerged and projected 2100 elevations and habitat distributions that were similar to present day in this scenario elevation relative to mtl was only 0 13 m less than present day conditions in the restored refuge and 0 11 m less at restored east delta wide the extent of low and mid salt marsh decreased slightly while high salt marsh increased by 34 intermittently increasing the mean daily suspended sediment load from 300 t d to 1 000 t d once every 10 years did little to stave off the effects of accelerated slr according to model projections under moderate slr mean elevations in 2100 were 0 67 0 68 m in the restored refuge 1 62 0 51 m at restored east and 0 90 1 21 m in relict marsh fig 6 these values were only 6 8 cm greater than those projected in 2100 without any additional sediment input a similar trend occurred under high slr with intermittent sediment where 2100 elevations were projected to be only 7 cm greater in the restored refuge restored east and relict marsh than those estimated under the model scenario without additional sediment conversely doubling the amount of sediment delivered to the nrd appeared to be the most effective scenario to prevent the submergence of emergent marsh and to maintain the estuarine habitat mosaic over the coming century under moderate slr mosaics projected that mean elevation relative to mtl would increase by 0 45 m in the restored refuge 0 31 m at restored east and 0 41 m in the relict marsh given modeled conditions the extent of delta mudflat habitat would decrease by 29 while high salt marsh would increase by 52 fig 7 table 4 under high rates of slr with doubled sediment inputs mean elevations would only decrease by 0 28 m in the restored refuge 0 21 m at restored east and 0 10 m in the relict marsh given these rates of elevation change the extent of low and mid salt marsh would be halved but high salt marsh would still increase by 23 with up to 42 000 000 m3 of sediment trapped behind alder dam czuba et al 2012b the hypothetical scenario of dam removal would result in almost all the currently existing marsh being converted to upland habitat by 2100 even after accounting for slr fig 7 table 4 under moderate slr mean elevation relative to mtl would increase by 1 5 m in the restored refuge 0 61 m at restored east and 1 27 m in the relict marsh fig 6 the model forecasted similar conditions under high slr where elevation relative to mtl would increase by 1 3 m in the restored refuge 0 66 m at restored east and 1 20 m in the relict marsh under this scenario most of the delta would be predominated by subtidal and upland habitats by 2100 but eelgrass beds and high salt marsh were also expected to increase 4 discussion our study effectively demonstrates how empirical monitoring data can be used as part of a decision support tool to forecast differences in the long term resilience of restored and relict estuaries when confronted with slr we evaluated the relative effects of alternative sediment management scenarios on the persistence and composition of estuarine habitats using a hierarchical numerical model mosaics model predictions indicated that post restoration marsh accretion in the nrd is occurring at a slow but steady rate and will likely continue to do so over the next 40 years if slr does not accelerate short term model output predicted roughly 3 cm of elevation gain relative to mtl in the subsided restoration area restored refuge and 5 cm of elevation gain in the higher elevation restoration area restored east between 2011 and 2020 this is consistent with observations from set readings table 2 sediment pins rtk gps surveys usgs unpublished data and sediment cores drexler et al 2019 differences between projected habitat distributions in 2011 and 2020 were marginal suggesting that post disturbance vegetative succession rather than accretion mediated habitat change is driving the ongoing transition from mudflat to salt marsh in the subsided restoration area long term scenarios of climate change demonstrated varying levels of resilience to predictions of rising sea levels under current estimated slr rates of 2 mm yr bromirski et al 2011 the nrd was predicted to continue to increase in elevation through the end of the 21st century restored and relict tidal marshes gained 0 38 0 43 m of elevation relative to mtl by 2100 and almost all the subsided restoration area was converted from mudflat and low marsh to mid and high marsh yet current rates of slr are likely to increase nrc 2012 and ipcc 2014 estimates of global slr are 0 53 0 98 m with projected ranges of 0 10 1 43 m along the pacific northwest coast moderate estimates for seattle washington predict a 0 62 0 29 m increase in tidal levels by 2100 but the upper limit of these projections is becoming more likely as ice sheets in antarctica and greenland continue to melt deconto and pollard 2016 under the moderate slr scenario our model indicated that the relict tidal marsh would exhibit resilience to rising tidal levels while the subsided restoration area would decrease 0 12 m in elevation and the higher elevation restoration area would decrease 0 02 m in elevation if slr approaches the higher end of forecasted trends almost all the restored refuge is predicted to convert to intertidal mudflat habitat after sinking to approximately 0 07 m below mtl restored east would decrease from a mean elevation of 1 58 m to 0 94 m above mtl becoming a mix of brackish marsh salt marsh and mudflat while much of the relict marsh would also be converted to intertidal mudflat especially at the northern end of the estuary this study highlights the importance of incorporating a variety of management scenarios into a decision support tool because the submergence of tidal marsh is an undesirable outcome in most systems the scenario raising the initial marsh elevation by 0 5 m decreased the likelihood of marsh drowning by creating a higher baseline platform and promoting vegetative biomass in the mississippi river delta as little as 10 cm of additional sediment has bolstered plant productivity and soil condition thus protecting marshes against erosion and submergence delaune et al 1990 slocum et al 2005 although the entire delta was raised in our simulation realistically such a strategy would only be used on small swaths of land due to construction costs logistics and the risks of over engineering a vulnerable ecosystem with permanent physical features elliott et al 2016 at least 1 5 million cubic meters of sediment would be necessary to raise the restored refuge by 0 5 m alternatively thin layers of sediment augmentation may provide the needed elevation capital for drowning marshes and cause less ecological disruption than large scale dredging but recovery may require repeated supplementation and thus may be more appropriate for small areas with a nearby appropriate sediment source mcattee 2018 the addition of sediment through natural hydrologic processes and altered reservoir practices represents a more gradual and sustainable strategy even with the risk of disruptive effects from increasing turbidity henley et al 2000 thrush et al 2004 nrc 2011 output from the mosaics model showed that an intermittent sediment pulse with increased rainy season sediment inputs of 1 000 t d every ten years did little to enhance the resilience of estuarine tidal marsh under moderate and high slr scenarios elevation relative to mtl was only 6 8 cm greater in 2100 than projected elevations for simulations without any sediment delivery at all on the other hand doubling the daily amount of sediment delivered to the delta during the rainy season had a considerable impact under moderate slr augmented sediment delivery resulted in a change in elevation relative to mtl of 0 44 m in the subsided restored refuge 0 31 m at restored east and 0 41 m in the relict marsh this scenario resulted in an estimated 50 expansion in the areal extent of high salt marsh under high slr with doubled sediment inputs elevations were still projected to decline but only about a third as much as if there was no augmented sediment delivery at all the elevation relative to mtl of the subsided restoration area would decrease by 0 29 m the higher elevation restoration area would decrease by 0 21 m and the relict marsh would decrease by 0 10 m these changes resulted in a roughly 50 decrease in the extent of modeled low salt marsh and mid salt marsh and a modest increase in high salt marsh while the loss of low and mid salt marsh would not be ideal it represents a potential improvement over inaction our final model simulation mimicked the removal of the alder lagrande dam complex by increasing rainy season sediment loads from 300 t d to 3 000 t d the resultant model output showed a homogenized landscape of upland and subtidal habitat under moderate and high slr scenarios because this concentration of suspended sediment was outside the range of observed measurements for the nrd it is likely that model output overestimated the amount of sediment that would be delivered directly to the existing marsh plain as opposed to nearshore subtidal zones the elwha dam removal on the nearby olympic peninsula offers a real world albeit short term example of how post dam removal disturbance can physically and biologically alter a large river delta in the months following the deconstruction of the elwha and glines canyon dams more than 7 5 million tons of sediment were released into the river gelfenbaum et al 2015 warrick et al 2015 sandy and muddy substrates were deposited at the mouth and nearby sea floor primarily at subtidal elevations this resulted in the seaward expansion of the estuary by over 0 28 km2 with nearshore elevation gains of up to 5 m despite the expansion of intertidal beaches and river bars at the mouth of the river the extent of vegetated habitat had declined by about 6 as of two years post dam removal foley et al 2017 this response is typical of large scale disturbance and habitat configurations are expected to change and recover as sediment conditions river flow and tidal currents stabilize several management actions were not addressed in this study including active planting of marsh vegetation increasing delta connectivity and purchase of adjacent land to foster inland migration while vegetation plays a vital role in capturing sediment and preventing erosive forces active planting elsewhere has not accelerated functional recovery trajectories in managed or restored wetlands when compared to successional growth moreno mateos et al 2015 increasing the connectivity of the river to its adjacent delta to augment the number of sediment pathways is a practical solution when flow regimes have been altered but will not increase the total amount of suspended sediment delivered to the system elliott et al 2016 the prevention of coastal squeeze through easements land acquisition or restrictions on development may be necessary in cases where estuaries are at a higher risk of drowning despite the implementation of one or more of the aforementioned management actions torio and chmura 2013 estuarine expansion may be particularly challenging in urban environments where the surrounding area has already been heavily developed or where steep embankments prevent landward encroachment stralberg et al 2011 thorne et al 2018 at nisqually inland expansion is prevented by the i 5 corridor at the southern end of the study area and by escarpments to the east and west clearly the nrd is faced with its own set of limitations and challenges that may differ from other focal systems underscoring the need for more flexible monitoring based decision support tools our empirical model projected a diverse set of outcomes when presented with different tidal level and sediment inputs however all models are abstractions of reality in hierarchical models with an iterative time step error may be propagated through time especially when contemporary datasets are used to project long term outcomes our model sensitivity analyses showed that distance from the nisqually river had a magnifying effect on yearly elevational change where iterations with higher sediment loads were likely to overestimate elevation change in areas farther from the river and underestimate elevation change in areas closer to the river projections were also higher for highly vegetated areas within 10 m of the tidal channel edge although they did not fall outside the range of observed set measurements fortunately the longitudinal sensitivity analysis indicated that error in the inundation soil pore salinity and vegetation components of mosaics was unlikely to propagate outside the range of variation that would otherwise be expected based on year to year fluctuations in suspended sediment only model error in the elevation change component itself appeared to have notable effect on the final predicted output the mosaics model provides a reasonable representation of future habitat conditions despite potential spatial and temporal errors because its output is intermediate to other marsh accretion models for example projections for the year 2100 showed slightly more retention of relict marsh habitat under moderate and high slr scenarios than warmer model estimates by thorne et al 2018 but considerably more habitat loss than earlier slamm models which forecasted that almost all the restored and relict marsh would persist through the end of the 21st century glick et al 2007 discrepancies among models shed light on the need for a comparative analysis that evaluates tradeoffs in simplicity accuracy generalizability cost and ease of use with regards to mosaics its application to other estuaries would require basic to intermediate experience with non linear models and maximum likelihood estimation and the required data could be a constraint for estuaries that do not already have focused monitoring programs in place nevertheless our study has demonstrated the potential utility of the mosaics decision support tool for using site specific monitoring data to project changes to the estuarine habitat mosaic under varying conditions especially for river deltas where elevation change is dominated by inputs of inorganic sediment 5 conclusion empirically based decision support tools that allow for multiple climate change and management scenarios are important for restoration planning especially given the threat of global slr managers rarely have the opportunity to manipulate suspended sediment inputs on a whole estuary scale thom 2000 teal and weishar 2005 callaway et al 2007 however adaptive reservoir management options to increase sediment delivery to sediment deficient river deltas may help ameliorate the effects of slr on marsh sustainability lee et al 2016 at nisqually this was especially true for the subsided restoration area which was predicted to be less resilient than the adjacent relict marsh due to its lower starting elevations and lack of vegetative complexity we expect this will be true of other systems in which the marsh plain is subsided and or degraded as such managers would benefit from considering long term mitigation actions before construction even begins simenstad et al 2006 sediment and stream gauge data are now available for most waterways in online repositories allowing planners to assess whether current suspended sediment inputs will be sufficient to promote viable accretion rates and how they might be affected by future drought and flooding events by incorporating empirical monitoring datasets into ecological models and simplifying decision support tools for ease of use we can improve the adaptive

collection described in main body of text and included all plant species with an occurrence 2 5 in our analysis we characterized communities by elevation relative to mean tidal level mtl and soil pore salinity all environmental variables were standardized before calculating a euclidean distance matrix because our objective was to group species into distinct habitat types we chose to test several space conserving agglomeration methods including centroid linkage median linkage average linkage and ward s minimum variance we used the cophenetic correlation coefficient to evaluate each resultant dendrogram s goodness of fit and the agglomerative coefficient to measure its degree of clustering a scree plot of similarity was examined to determine the optimal number of vegetation communities i e

the ratio of shoot presence to shoot absence was greater than 1 1 results a comparison of several clustering methods determined that the average linkage method had the greatest cophenetic correlation coefficient centroid 0 68 median 0 55 average 0 72 ward s 0 70 however ward s method produced the highest agglomerative coefficient centroid 0 87 median 0 82 average 0 80 ward s 0 98 a rand index value of 0 84 supported a high degree of similarity between the average and ward s clustering methods because our objective was to group vegetation species into distinct communities we chose to use ward s minimum variance as the best fit clustering solution the scree plot showed that partitioning the dendrogram into 6 habitat types offered the most appropriate degree of separation the species composition for each habitat type and its associated environmental characteristics are shown in table a1 and fig a1 optimal eelgrass growth on the nrd occurred between 2 97 and 2 31 m elevation relative to mtl or when habitat was inundated about 94 1 5 of the time eelgrass was rarely observed at the mouth of the nisqually river even within the modeled elevation range to account for this in the habitat model we instituted a buffer whereby no eelgrass habitat was predicted within 500 m path distance of the river appendix b soil pore salinity model selection see table b1 
24990,widespread land use change in coastal ecosystems has led to a decline in the amount of habitat available for fish and wildlife lower production of ecosystem goods and services and loss of recreational and aesthetic value this has prompted global efforts to restore the natural hydrologic regimes of developed shorelines especially resource rich estuaries but the resilience of these restored ecosystems in the face of accelerated sea level rise slr remains uncertain we implemented a monitoring based simulation of accretion in coastal estuaries mosaics in r statistical software to address uncertainty in the resilience of modified estuarine habitats using the nisqually river delta in the pacific northwest usa as a case study mosaics is a spatially explicit model with a numerical foundation that uses empirical monitoring datasets to forecast habitat change in response to rising tidal levels because it accounts for the crucial ecomorphodynamic feedbacks between tidal inundation vegetative growth and sediment accretion mosaics can be used to determine whether alternative management scenarios such as enhanced sediment inputs will bolster estuarine resilience to slr under moderate slr 0 62 m the model predicted that a two fold increase in mean daily suspended sediment during the rainy season was sufficient to maintain nisqually s emergent marshes through 2100 but under high slr 1 35 m mosaics indicated that greater sediment additions would be necessary to prevent submergence a comparison between a restored marsh with subsided and high elevation areas and a relict marsh demonstrated that the subsided restoration area was highly susceptible to slr findings from the mosaics model highlight the importance of a site s initial elevation capacity for producing above and belowground biomass and suspended sediment availability when considering management actions in estuaries and other coastal ecosystems keywords estuarine habitat mosaic hierarchical model scenario analysis sea level rise sediment accretion tidal wetlands 1 introduction estuaries and their associated tidal marshes connect freshwater riverine ecosystems to the open ocean thereby playing a critical role in supporting marine ecosystem function mclusky and elliot 2004 beaumont et al 2007 they supply valuable economic cultural and ecological goods and services including habitat for fish waterbirds and mammals simenstad and cordell 2000 greenberg et al 2006 barbier et al 2011 consequently their preservation is a priority for coastal management over the coming century global sea level

crosby et al 2016 shoreline armoring levees and dams further compound the threat of slr by removing many estuaries from tidal influence preventing them from migrating inland and reducing sediment accretion kirwan and murray 2008 jackson 2010 major efforts are underway to eliminate unnecessary barriers to tidal exchange but restored estuaries are often subject to degradation which can reduce their resilience to slr and other natural hazards callaway et al 2007 vandenbruwaene et al 2011 historically estuarine tidal marshes have been able to counter the effects of slr via an ecomorphodynamic feedback cycle whereby tidal inundation vegetative growth and sediment accumulation allow the marsh plain to keep pace with gradually increasing tidal levels kirwan et al 2010 french 2006 fitzgerald et al 2008 specifically marsh vegetation traps suspended sediment and slows the flow of water across the marsh surface thereby facilitating sediment deposition and accretion d alpaos et al 2007 2011 habitat degradation due to disturbance development or management actions may inhibit this feedback cycle by facilitating erosion hindering sediment delivery or limiting above and belowground productivity syvitski et al 2009 vandenbruwaene et al 2011 burdick and roman 2012 practitioners can augment the capacity of at risk tidal marshes to respond to disturbance i e their resilience through the physical modification of sedimentation and subsidence rates but there are often ecological physical or demographic limitations to the continued stability of estuarine habitat kirwan and megonigal 2013 given these limitations practitioners may benefit from a decision support tool that uses empirical data to identify vulnerable areas in a restored or degraded estuary predicts changes to the estuarine habitat mosaic and simulates the effects of alternative management scenarios given projected estimates of slr marsh accretion models can be used as decision support tools to help managers determine a target estuary s long term resilience there is considerable breadth in the type and utility of marsh accretion models rybczyk and callaway 2009 mcleod et al 2010 ranging from generalized numerical equations and simplified inundation simulations titus and richman 2001 kirwan et al 2010 to spatially explicit process based models schile et al 2014 morris et al 2016 thorne et al 2018 at present tradeoffs between accuracy and simplicity have opened a niche for habitat change models that combine a transparent numerical foundation with localized empirical data such as that commonly collected in wetland monitoring programs a similar approach has already been used to predict water temperature morrill et al 2005 sharma et al 2008 phytoplankton productivity

in a variety of freshwater and marine ecosystems thus there is reason to believe that the combined use of existing monitoring datasets with numerical models may also be suitable for predicting estuarine habitat response to slr this study evaluates the effects of rising tidal levels and modified sediment management strategies on estuarine habitat by developing a monitoring based simulation of accretion in coastal estuaries mosaics we calibrated and tested mosaics in r statistical software r core development team 2017 using seven years of post restoration monitoring data from the nisqually river delta nrd in southern puget sound washington usa ellings et al 2016 woo et al 2018 the nrd is a macro tidal system comprised of a diverse habitat mosaic of upland tidal forests freshwater brackish and saline emergent marshes and intertidal mudflats these attributes make it an ideal case study to evaluate habitat resilience to slr and resultant changes in habitat distribution among historically managed and unaltered relict areas restoration actions conducted between 1996 and 2009 were led by billy frank jr nisqually national wildlife refuge hereafter refuge and the nisqually indian tribe hereafter tribe the restored marshes have provided ample foraging and roosting sites for economically valuable waterbirds and crucial nursery habitat for juvenile chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha ellings et al 2016 davis et al 2018 woo et al 2018 listed under the endangered species act as such state federal and tribal managers have a vested interest in maintaining the current extent of wetland habitat over the coming century here we describe our steps in constructing validating and evaluating mosaics which we used to evaluate long term habitat trajectories in a subsided restoration area a higher elevation restoration area and a relict tidal marsh our overarching objectives for this study were 1 develop an empirical model to project long term trajectories of elevation change and habitat distribution 2 manipulate tidal level and sediment input parameters to determine how management scenarios may influence the estuarine habitat mosaic under impending slr and 3 compare estimated changes in the habitat mosaic for restored and relict sites we anticipated that subsided restoration areas would exhibit less resilience to rising sea levels than the relict marsh due to lower initial elevations and a lack of vegetative biomass morris et al 2002 our approach demonstrates how monitoring data can play a crucial role in modeling efforts and can be used as part of a decision support tool to gauge the resilience of restored estuaries in the face of climate change 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the nisqually river originates from glacial discharge at the southwestern base of mount rainier washington usa from there the river meanders 130 km northward where it empties into puget sound between the cities of olympia and tacoma 47 08 n 122 70 w forming a large river delta with an areal extent of approximately 20 km2 between 1904 and 2009 roughly 5 km2 of the delta s marshes were diked or leveed for agriculture resulting in habitat loss for a variety of fish and wildlife species agricultural practices including the drying of wetland soils led to peat degradation and subsidence with elevations behind the dikes subsiding up to 1 5 m lower than the surrounding marsh plain in 2009 the refuge removed 8 km of dikes on the west side of the river restoring over 3 km2 of subsided marsh to tidal influence restored refuge fig 1 this major restoration project along with several smaller restorations carried out by the tribe on the east side of the river in 1996 pilot 2002 phase i and 2006 phase ii restored east represents the largest composite estuary restoration in puget sound to date as of publication the restored refuge sits at 0 2 m above mean tidal level mtl 1 34 m navd88 while restored east is generally higher in elevation 1 3 m above mtl islands of relict salt marsh relict marsh bound both restoration areas to the north and west and are characterized by vegetated platforms 1 3 m above mtl incised by a fractal network of tidal channels in addition to its restored and relict marshes the nrd consists of a diverse habitat mosaic including upland forests freshwater and brackish tidal wetlands intertidal mudflats eelgrass zostera marina beds and nearshore subtidal areas belleveau et al 2015 ballanti et al 2017 davenport et al 2017 appendix a a tidal range of more than 6 m during spring tides and frequent storm events throughout the autumn rainy season ensure that much of this mosaic is inundated at high tide the nrd was originally formed by infrequent volcanic events such as lahar flows pringle and scott 2001 but regular inputs of inorganic sediment are crucial for maintaining the current extent and configuration of estuarine habitat each year spring snow melt and autumn rainfall carry sediment to the nrd where it is deposited or carried away by tidal currents in 1945 construction of the alder lagrande dam complex was completed at river kilometer 65 trapping more than 42 million m3 of sediment czuba et al 2012a curran et al 2016 as a result the current quantity that is transported to the mouth of the nisqually river is low compared to other similarly sized puget sound rivers czuba et al 2011 various tributaries feed into the main stem below the dam but it is estimated that only 10 of the primary sediment load generated upstream reaches the mouth of the river nelson 1974 czuba et al 2012a consequently it is important to consider the interplay between depleted inorganic sediment inputs and changing tidal regimes when assessing the response of the nrd to rising tidal levels 2 2 data collection post restoration monitoring efforts were conducted throughout the nrd in 2010 2017 as part of a larger comprehensive monitoring plan we collected data throughout restored and relict marshes with varying levels of freshwater and tidal input fig 1 tables 1 and 2 when possible we targeted sampling sites adjacent to tidal sloughs such that geomorphological and biological datasets overlapped spatially we did not include sampling sites in areas that had been removed from tidal influence including freshwater wetlands within the new dike or wetlands to the south of the i 5 highway barrier all relevant datasets contributing to the construction and validation of mosaics are described in detail in sections 2 2 1 2 2 5 2 2 1 water level we used barometrically compensated water level data collected from a solinst ltc level logger located in a relict marsh channel fig 1 to quantify inundation duration and calculate a tidal datum data were logged continuously at 6 12 or 15 minute intervals between february 2010 and january 2015 and were converted from water level m to vertical elevation m navd88 based on real time kinematic global positioning system rtk gps measured sensor height ellings et al 2016 we used the complete dataset to calculate a tidal datum for the nrd mtl for the estuary was 1 34 m with a mean high water level mhw of 2 82 m a mean higher high water level mhhw of 3 11 m a mean low water level mlw of 0 11 m and a mean lower low water level mllw of 1 00 m for study purposes mhhw was calculated as the average height of the highest tide recorded by the water logger each day between 2010 and 2015 while mllw was the average height of the lowest daily tide 2 2 2 vegetation surveys to estimate and model aboveground vegetative biomass we conducted vegetation surveys at 30 sites in september 2009 2015 fig 1 at each site we measured mean percent cover canopy height and stem density for all species observed within a 0 25 m2 sampling quadrat we sampled three quadrats per site at locations 0 20 and 40 m from the edge of an adjacent tidal slough to account for spatial variation in sediment distribution we also noted local habitat characteristics such as water depth and overhead canopy cover associated soil pore salinity values psu were obtained for each surveyed quadrat by drawing out moisture from the top layer of marsh sediment and analyzing the extracted water with a refractometer belowground biomass was not measured and thus could not be included as a model parameter despite evidence that it may contribute to organic matter deposition and stabilization of the marsh plain nyman et al 1993 turner et al 2004 kirwan and guntenspergen 2012 2 2 3 elevation change we measured elevation change through time at a precision of up to 1 mm using deep rod surface elevation tables sets cahoon et al 2002 located at 14 restored and relict marsh sites fig 1 we took an initial set measurement immediately after the restoration in september 2009 and collected yearly measurements every spring thereafter through april 2017 feldspar horizon markers and sediment pins adjacent to each set were used to measure corresponding sediment accretion rates although due to scouring and obvious sediment redistribution at the northwest corner of the restored refuge horizon markers were not considered to be an accurate measure of sediment deposition at these sites 2 2 4 suspended sediment because we did not collect empirical measurements of suspended sediment we used a regression model to estimate sediment load to the nrd curran et al 2016 l 0 00199 q 2 68 b c f where l is suspended sediment load in metric tons per day t d q is river discharge in cubic meters per second m3 s and bcf is a bias correction factor equal to 1 17 we obtained daily mean discharge estimates from a combination of water data reports and publicly available water quality data https waterdata usgs gov nwis these data were then converted to mean daily suspended sediment loads using the transport curve equation for total yearly inputs and for the rainy season october march intra annual variation was accounted for in the model such that the sediment term was randomly generated from a log normal distribution for each time step based on mean daily suspended sediment concentrations during the rainy season 300 100 t d 2 2 5 spatial data we used a 3 m resolution bare earth digital elevation model dem acquired from airborne topographic lidar collected in january 2011 watershed sciences inc portland oregon usa to determine initial elevation values for the spatially explicit model these data were validated to a measured vertical accuracy of 3 cm using rtk gps and boat mounted bathymetric surveys we hand digitized channels and other water features on georeferenced aerial imagery flown in summer 2011 bergman photographic services inc portland oregon usa ellings et al 2016 we derived several spatial datasets using the 2011 dem for each 3 3 m cell we analyzed least cost path distances to the delta at mtl i e marsh edge the nearest freshwater source nisqually river or mcallister creek and the nisqually river main stem using the path distance tool in arcgis 10 3 software esri inc redlands california usa we used the euclidean distance tool in arcgis to measure the straight line distance between each cell and the edge of the nearest tidal channel all spatial datasets were georeferenced to the wgs84 coordinate system 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 model structure and parameterization the mosaics model and decision support

significantly impact elevations at longer timescales verdonck 2006 using the set data we modeled elevation change δe as an iterative yearly time step t for each raster cell x y with inundation duration i aboveground vegetative biomass v and suspended sediment l as primary drivers we applied a maximum likelihood estimation procedure with the bbmle package in r 3 4 1 bolker 2017 to parameterize each equation using the empirical monitoring datasets described in section 2 2 to model elevation change through time we used an autoregressive framework based on d alpaos et al 2011 1 e

vegetation eorg is dependent upon vegetation eer is dependent upon inundation and egeo is constant for the entire study area 0 5 mm yr verdonck 2006 fig 2 suspended sediment concentrations decay exponentially with distance from the sediment source stumpf 1983 christiansen et al 2000 because we did not have spatially explicit data for suspended sediment we used position on the marsh plain in relation to tidal channels as a proxy for spatial variation in sediment distribution which is broadly recognized to influence accretion rates christiansen et al 2000 d alpaos et al 2007 li and yang 2009 specifically we modeled suspended sediment as a linear function of a cell s path distance from the nisqually river main stem riv and as an exponentially decreasing function of its euclidean distance from the nearest tidal channel edge chan the relationship between elevation change and inundation was modeled as an exponential decay function increasing form based on a preliminary analysis of the sediment pin and horizon marker data showing that esed leveled off asymptotically with increasing inundation duration thus the mathematical form of each component was 3 e s e d l t 1 e i a i t

terms of the model were structured such that when l or i were zero elevation change was dependent solely on organic matter accumulation eorg when v was zero elevation change was dependent exclusively on mineral sedimentation and erosive forces esed eer and when all three were zero only geologic uplift and subsidence egeo affected yearly elevation change we parameterized the full model for δe using the set data the egeo constant was not included in the model parameterization process because such geologic processes were not directly measured by the sets the inputs for inundation duration and aboveground vegetative biomass were expressed as their own set of hierarchical equations we modeled the relationship between inundation duration and surface elevation as a cumulative distribution of the proportion of time a cell of elevation e was submerged by the tide during a given year t bockelmann et al 2002 temmerman et al 2003 to incorporate changing sea levels we used elevation relative to mtl assuming mtl stayed relatively constant at 1 34 m navd88 between 2010 and 2015 we parameterized a cumulative distribution function on incrementally increasing elevation values representing the full range of elevations observed for the nisqually estuary 1 3 5 m relative to mtl 7 i t x y 1 1 a e b e t x y 1 c the function was given a lower asymptote of 0 and an upper asymptote of 1 to limit i to proportional values and the model was fit to the data by parameterizing a b and c we modeled total aboveground vegetative biomass as a function of inundation duration and soil pore salinity s while we did not explicitly measure aboveground biomass using the vegetation quadrats it is calculable as a function of several structural parameters including stem density per unit area and mean plant height morris and haskin 1990 thursby et al 2002 we calculated per area standing biomass g m2 for each species j observed in a sampling quadrat using the equation vj 0 04njhj where nj is the species extrapolated stem density per m2 and hj is its average stem height this equation was based on literature values and observed height biomass relationships for carex lyngbyei distichlis spicata and salicornia pacifica byrd et al 2017 2018 the sum across all observed species was considered the total estimated vegetative biomass value for a given sampling quadrat and was used as our input dataset for parameterizing v we modeled vegetative biomass as a gaussian function with respect to inundation duration this was reflective of the polynomial relationship for halophilic marsh plants demonstrated by morris et al 2002 and janousek et al 2016 showing that productivity increases with greater elevations relative to mtl but then starts to decrease again at a threshold height we chose a gaussian equation to keep biomass above zero for the full range of inundation duration values 0 1 we also included an interaction effect with soil pore salinity because exploratory data analyses determined that biomass decreased with increasing soil salinities leveling off around 50 psu our final model for predicting v was 8 v t x y n e δ s t x y e i t x y μ 2 2 σ 2 where i was determined from eq 7 s was determined from eq 9 below and n δ μ and σ were shape parameters estimates of soil pore salinity were necessary to calculate vegetative biomass and to identify different estuarine habitat types soil salinity is governed by several environmental factors including the frequency and duration of tidal inundation distance from the nearest source of freshwater and distance from the marsh edge odum 1988 moffett et al 2010 high elevation marshes tend to be more saline than low elevation marshes because evapotranspiration and infrequent tidal flushing can lead to the accumulation of salt within the soil callaway et al 2007 while sites closer to riverine freshwater inputs tend to have lower salinities an exploratory analysis suggested that the relationships between soil pore salinity inundation and a site s position on the marsh plain were highly complex so we used an information theoretic approach to compare several non linear candidate models for s appendix b an exponential decay function was used to define the asymptotic relationship between soil pore salinity and distance from the river main stem and several additive and interactive functions including distance from the marsh edge mar and inundation duration were tested we parameterized each candidate model using maximum likelihood estimation and selected the best fit model using akaike s information criterion aic burnham and anderson 2002 we determined the best fit model structure to be 9 s t x y α β m a r x y c γ i t x y 1 e k r i v x y where i was ascertained using eq 7 and α β γ c and k were shape parameters our final step was to classify a given cell as a specific estuarine habitat type given model outputs h for each time step in most estuaries habitat type is primarily related to inundation duration and soil pore salinity and is generally defined by the vegetation species occupying a particular tract of the marsh plain species tolerances for inundation regimes and soil pore salinity can vary widely among regions and among estuaries pennings et al 2005 silvestri et al 2005 so we used vegetation survey data and a clustering algorithm to define inundation and salinity ranges for each habitat type detailed methods along with a list of plant species observed in each habitat type are outlined in appendix a we applied mosaics to the nrd by calculating i s v δe and h iteratively on an annual time step for each 3 3 m cell the 2011 dem was used for our initial elevation values and the spatial datasets described in section 2 2 5 were used as measurements of riv mar and chan all spatially explicit model analyses were conducted with the rgdal and raster packages in r bivand et al 2019 hijmans 2019 2 3 2 model validation to validate the elevation change model we conducted a sensitivity analysis using parameter space estimation in the r package pse we varied predictor variables over a range of uniformly or normally distributed realistic values including inundation duration i 0 1 suspended sediment input l mean sd 300 100 t d vegetative biomass v 0 5 000 g m2 path distance to the nisqually river riv 0 2 000 m and euclidean distance to the nearest channel edge chan 0 300 m we produced 3d surface plots of model output when parameter space was manipulated for two variables at a time to discern each variable s distinct influence on annual elevation change mm the autoregressive structure of mosaics meant that model error was potentially propagated through time we conducted a second longitudinal sensitivity analysis where elevation change was simulated through time 2011 2100 for a single hypothetical cell under present day slr we tested initial elevations e0 of 1 0 1 2 and 3 m relative to mtl while riv was held constant at 550 m mar was held constant at 550 m chan was held constant at 30 m and l was set to 300 t d we varied i s v and δe by 1 root mean squared error rmse as a percentage of the full range of observed values rmse was determined from the maximum likelihood estimation procedure for model eqs 7 9 8 and 2 respectively table 3 2 3 3 management scenarios we used mosaics as a decision support tool to determine how slr in the nrd might affect the elevation and habitat composition of its restored and relict marshes through the year 2100 scenarios included present day slr 2 mm yr or 0 18 m by 2100 bromirski et al 2011 moderate slr 0 62 m by 2100 nrc 2012 and high slr 1 35 m by 2100 where mtl was adjusted accordingly for rates of change additionally we tested several management scenarios for increasing the delivery and retention of suspended sediment in river deltas including raising initial elevations through dredging or sediment augmentation periodic riverine sediment pulses via altered reservoir practices and dam removal nrc 2011 present day 2009 2016 mean suspended sediment loads for the nrd range from 5 35 t d during the summer to 100 550 t d during the rainy season with peaks of up to 10 000 t d during major storm events curran et al 2016 to simulate periodic sediment loads we introduced spikes in suspended sediment 1 000 t d once every 10 years to test the effects of a gradual increase in sediment delivery i e through altered reservoir practices we increased annual suspended sediment inputs two fold from an average of 300 t d to 600 t d during the rainy season assuming lower summer discharge and sediment concentrations would have less of an effect on sediment accretion on an annual time scale to simulate unrestrained sediment input i e dam removal we increased mean seasonal sediment loads from 300 t d to 3 000 t d based on an estimated dam trap efficiency of 90 and an estimated river retention rate of roughly 50 czuba et al 2012a we also tested a scenario where we raised initial elevations across the delta by 0 5 m although realistically this strategy would only be viable at smaller spatial scales we tested each sediment input scenario in tandem with moderate and high estimates of slr nrc 2012 to determine whether additional suspended sediment could mitigate potential habitat loss 3 results 3 1 model structure and validation we successfully parameterized each hierarchical component of mosaics i s v δe using the empirical datasets tables 1 and 2 model rmse was less than 16 of the range of observed values for each component table 3 for δe the parameters rb in the sediment capture equation ecap and va in the organic matter deposition equation eorg converged on zero so they were omitted from the final model this meant that eorg essentially had no effect on elevation change in the nrd contrary to previous observations of 45 organic matter content in relict marsh sediments see drexler et al 2019 instead inorganic sediments esed were the predominant contributor to annual elevation change for all scenarios although erosive processes eer negated this contribution in areas that were inundated more than 50 of the time sediment capture by vegetation ecap augmented annual elevation change by 0 70 within the range of marsh plant inundation tolerances with peak contributions at an inundation duration of approximately 12 as such the greatest accretion rates were predicted to occur in areas that were inundated between 2 and 23 of the time the parameter space estimation procedure showed that most predicted model outcomes fell between 1 and 15 mm yr a realistic albeit conservative estimate based on annual observed set readings which ranged between 58 mm and 90 mm yr mean sd restored refuge 4 91 20 07 mm yr restored east 6 91 6 43 mm yr relict marsh 2 45 4 36 mm yr the sensitivity analysis also found that each predictor variable differed with respect to its relative effects on marsh accretion rates partial rank correlation coefficients indicated that positive accretion rates were more likely to occur farther from the nisqually river mean se prcc 0 90 0 02 and with greater suspended sediment loads 0 68 0 04 while negative accretion rates were more likely to occur in areas farther from tidal channels 0 37 0 05 vegetative biomass had a moderately positive relationship with increasing marsh elevations 0 31 0 04 three dimensional surfaces produced from a pairwise manipulation of parameter space supported these findings and highlighted parameter values that were more likely to produce unrealistic model output fig 3 in addition to error that was potentially introduced by the spatial inputs riv chan the longitudinal sensitivity analysis determined that model error was propagated through time however it appeared to have only a marginal effect regardless of a site s initial elevation the rmse of the inundation component was only 0 015 which was 1 5 of the total range of observed values 0 1 as such the inclusion of such minor error had little effect on the model output than would otherwise be expected based on year to year variance in the sediment term fig 4 unremarkable findings were also observed for soil pore salinity and vegetation despite higher rmse 15 the only component for which the propagation of error appeared to be a concern was for annual elevation change where the inclusion of error resulted in a 5 35 decrease rmse or 3 13 increase rmse in the final predicted elevation depending on initial elevation e0 3 2 present day conditions for the first decade after restoration 2011 2020 mosaics forecasted varying rates of elevation change throughout the delta with an overall trend toward elevation gain relative to mtl in the restored refuge 0 027 0 026 m restored east 0 042 0 047 m and relict marsh sites 0 049 0 051 m the model classified the 2011 estuarine habitat mosaic as 43 2 subtidal 6 4 eelgrass 11 3 intertidal mudflats 16 4 low elevation salt marsh 5 4 mid elevation salt marsh 8 7 high elevation salt marsh 4 9 brackish marsh 0 3 freshwater marsh and 3 5 upland habitat fig 5 the most notable changes in habitat distribution between 2011 and 2020 were observed in the intertidal mudflats 0 5 mid elevation salt marsh 1 1 and high elevation salt marsh 1 7 with zero change in the extent of low elevation salt marsh freshwater and upland habitats 3 3 management scenarios without additional suspended sediment inputs mosaics projected that mean elevation relative to mtl would increase by 0 38 m in the restored refuge 0 37 m at restored east and 0 43 m in the relict marsh by 2100 under present rates of slr fig 6 this scenario led to a 225 increase in the areal extent of upland habitat a 25 decrease in mudflat and an 18 decrease low salt marsh which was primarily driven by the egeo parameter fig 7 table 4 under moderate slr predicted elevations at all sites increased through 2050 before succumbing to rising tidal levels in 2100 as a result elevation relative to mtl decreased by 0 12 m in the restored refuge and 0 02 m at restored east while elevations increased slightly by 0 04 m in the relict marsh in this scenario upland habitat decreased to half its current areal extent as it was converted to high salt marsh and brackish marsh along the edge of the nisqually river the highest modeled rates of slr resulted in substantial submergence of marsh habitat throughout the nrd all three study areas experienced sharp declines in elevation especially during the latter half of the century the modeled elevation of the restored refuge decreased by 0 78 m meaning it was inundated for 57 of the average tidal cycle the elevations of restored east and relict marsh declined by 0 63 m and 0 56 m respectively this led to delta wide losses of low mid and high salt marsh brackish marsh and upland habitats predicted salt marsh submergence was especially noticeable in the restored refuge where almost all the low salt marsh was converted to intertidal mudflat by 2100 and only small swaths of high and brackish marsh remained along the edge of the nisqually river output from mosaics indicated that raising the initial marsh plain by 0 5 m effectively buffered against slr in the restored marshes under moderate slr mean elevations were 0 65 m higher than present day conditions in the restored refuge and 0 41 m higher at restored east by the year 2100 fig 6 delta wide the extent of high marsh was doubled while low and mid salt marsh declined by 54 and 18 respectively fig 7 table 4 in 2100 the predominant habitat type predicted for both restoration areas was high salt marsh with intermittent patches of brackish marsh and upland habitat when high slr rates were used in the model the 0 5 m elevation buffer was predicted to be enough to ensure that much of the subsided restored refuge was not submerged and projected 2100 elevations and habitat distributions that were similar to present day in this scenario elevation relative to mtl was only 0 13 m less than present day conditions in the restored refuge and 0 11 m less at restored east delta wide the extent of low and mid salt marsh decreased slightly while high salt marsh increased by 34 intermittently increasing the mean daily suspended sediment load from 300 t d to 1 000 t d once every 10 years did little to stave off the effects of accelerated slr according to model projections under moderate slr mean elevations in 2100 were 0 67 0 68 m in the restored refuge 1 62 0 51 m at restored east and 0 90 1 21 m in relict marsh fig 6 these values were only 6 8 cm greater than those projected in 2100 without any additional sediment input a similar trend occurred under high slr with intermittent sediment where 2100 elevations were projected to be only 7 cm greater in the restored refuge restored east and relict marsh than those estimated under the model scenario without additional sediment conversely doubling the amount of sediment delivered to the nrd appeared to be the most effective scenario to prevent the submergence of emergent marsh and to maintain the estuarine habitat mosaic over the coming century under moderate slr mosaics projected that mean elevation relative to mtl would increase by 0 45 m in the restored refuge 0 31 m at restored east and 0 41 m in the relict marsh given modeled conditions the extent of delta mudflat habitat would decrease by 29 while high salt marsh would increase by 52 fig 7 table 4 under high rates of slr with doubled sediment inputs mean elevations would only decrease by 0 28 m in the restored refuge 0 21 m at restored east and 0 10 m in the relict marsh given these rates of elevation change the extent of low and mid salt marsh would be halved but high salt marsh would still increase by 23 with up to 42 000 000 m3 of sediment trapped behind alder dam czuba et al 2012b the hypothetical scenario of dam removal would result in almost all the currently existing marsh being converted to upland habitat by 2100 even after accounting for slr fig 7 table 4 under moderate slr mean elevation relative to mtl would increase by 1 5 m in the restored refuge 0 61 m at restored east and 1 27 m in the relict marsh fig 6 the model forecasted similar conditions under high slr where elevation relative to mtl would increase by 1 3 m in the restored refuge 0 66 m at restored east and 1 20 m in the relict marsh under this scenario most of the delta would be predominated by subtidal and upland habitats by 2100 but eelgrass beds and high salt marsh were also expected to increase 4 discussion our study effectively demonstrates how empirical monitoring data can be used as part of a decision support tool to forecast differences in the long term resilience of restored and relict estuaries when confronted with slr we evaluated the relative effects of alternative sediment management scenarios on the persistence and composition of estuarine habitats using a hierarchical numerical model mosaics model predictions indicated that post restoration marsh accretion in the nrd is occurring at a slow but steady rate and will likely continue to do so over the next 40 years if slr does not accelerate short term model output predicted roughly 3 cm of elevation gain relative to mtl in the subsided restoration area restored refuge and 5 cm of elevation gain in the higher elevation restoration area restored east between 2011 and 2020 this is consistent with observations from set readings table 2 sediment pins rtk gps surveys usgs unpublished data and sediment cores drexler et al 2019 differences between projected habitat distributions in 2011 and 2020 were marginal suggesting that post disturbance vegetative succession rather than accretion mediated habitat change is driving the ongoing transition from mudflat to salt marsh in the subsided restoration area long term scenarios of climate change demonstrated varying levels of resilience to predictions of rising sea levels under current estimated slr rates of 2 mm yr bromirski et al 2011 the nrd was predicted to continue to increase in elevation through the end of the 21st century restored and relict tidal marshes gained 0 38 0 43 m of elevation relative to mtl by 2100 and almost all the subsided restoration area was converted from mudflat and low marsh to mid and high marsh yet current rates of slr are likely to increase nrc 2012 and ipcc 2014 estimates of global slr are 0 53 0 98 m with projected ranges of 0 10 1 43 m along the pacific northwest coast moderate estimates for seattle washington predict a 0 62 0 29 m increase in tidal levels by 2100 but the upper limit of these projections is becoming more likely as ice sheets in antarctica and greenland continue to melt deconto and pollard 2016 under the moderate slr scenario our model indicated that the relict tidal marsh would exhibit resilience to rising tidal levels while the subsided restoration area would decrease 0 12 m in elevation and the higher elevation restoration area would decrease 0 02 m in elevation if slr approaches the higher end of forecasted trends almost all the restored refuge is predicted to convert to intertidal mudflat habitat after sinking to approximately 0 07 m below mtl restored east would decrease from a mean elevation of 1 58 m to 0 94 m above mtl becoming a mix of brackish marsh salt marsh and mudflat while much of the relict marsh would also be converted to intertidal mudflat especially at the northern end of the estuary this study highlights the importance of incorporating a variety of management scenarios into a decision support tool because the submergence of tidal marsh is an undesirable outcome in most systems the scenario raising the initial marsh elevation by 0 5 m decreased the likelihood of marsh drowning by creating a higher baseline platform and promoting vegetative biomass in the mississippi river delta as little as 10 cm of additional sediment has bolstered plant productivity and soil condition thus protecting marshes against erosion and submergence delaune et al 1990 slocum et al 2005 although the entire delta was raised in our simulation realistically such a strategy would only be used on small swaths of land due to construction costs logistics and the risks of over engineering a vulnerable ecosystem with permanent physical features elliott et al 2016 at least 1 5 million cubic meters of sediment would be necessary to raise the restored refuge by 0 5 m alternatively thin layers of sediment augmentation may provide the needed elevation capital for drowning marshes and cause less ecological disruption than large scale dredging but recovery may require repeated supplementation and thus may be more appropriate for small areas with a nearby appropriate sediment source mcattee 2018 the addition of sediment through natural hydrologic processes and altered reservoir practices represents a more gradual and sustainable strategy even with the risk of disruptive effects from increasing turbidity henley et al 2000 thrush et al 2004 nrc 2011 output from the mosaics model showed that an intermittent sediment pulse with increased rainy season sediment inputs of 1 000 t d every ten years did little to enhance the resilience of estuarine tidal marsh under moderate and high slr scenarios elevation relative to mtl was only 6 8 cm greater in 2100 than projected elevations for simulations without any sediment delivery at all on the other hand doubling the daily amount of sediment delivered to the delta during the rainy season had a considerable impact under moderate slr augmented sediment delivery resulted in a change in elevation relative to mtl of 0 44 m in the subsided restored refuge 0 31 m at restored east and 0 41 m in the relict marsh this scenario resulted in an estimated 50 expansion in the areal extent of high salt marsh under high slr with doubled sediment inputs elevations were still projected to decline but only about a third as much as if there was no augmented sediment delivery at all the elevation relative to mtl of the subsided restoration area would decrease by 0 29 m the higher elevation restoration area would decrease by 0 21 m and the relict marsh would decrease by 0 10 m these changes resulted in a roughly 50 decrease in the extent of modeled low salt marsh and mid salt marsh and a modest increase in high salt marsh while the loss of low and mid salt marsh would not be ideal it represents a potential improvement over inaction our final model simulation mimicked the removal of the alder lagrande dam complex by increasing rainy season sediment loads from 300 t d to 3 000 t d the resultant model output showed a homogenized landscape of upland and subtidal habitat under moderate and high slr scenarios because this concentration of suspended sediment was outside the range of observed measurements for the nrd it is likely that model output overestimated the amount of sediment that would be delivered directly to the existing marsh plain as opposed to nearshore subtidal zones the elwha dam removal on the nearby olympic peninsula offers a real world albeit short term example of how post dam removal disturbance can physically and biologically alter a large river delta in the months following the deconstruction of the elwha and glines canyon dams more than 7 5 million tons of sediment were released into the river gelfenbaum et al 2015 warrick et al 2015 sandy and muddy substrates were deposited at the mouth and nearby sea floor primarily at subtidal elevations this resulted in the seaward expansion of the estuary by over 0 28 km2 with nearshore elevation gains of up to 5 m despite the expansion of intertidal beaches and river bars at the mouth of the river the extent of vegetated habitat had declined by about 6 as of two years post dam removal foley et al 2017 this response is typical of large scale disturbance and habitat configurations are expected to change and recover as sediment conditions river flow and tidal currents stabilize several management actions were not addressed in this study including active planting of marsh vegetation increasing delta connectivity and purchase of adjacent land to foster inland migration while vegetation plays a vital role in capturing sediment and preventing erosive forces active planting elsewhere has not accelerated functional recovery trajectories in managed or restored wetlands when compared to successional growth moreno mateos et al 2015 increasing the connectivity of the river to its adjacent delta to augment the number of sediment pathways is a practical solution when flow regimes have been altered but will not increase the total amount of suspended sediment delivered to the system elliott et al 2016 the prevention of coastal squeeze through easements land acquisition or restrictions on development may be necessary in cases where estuaries are at a higher risk of drowning despite the implementation of one or more of the aforementioned management actions torio and chmura 2013 estuarine expansion may be particularly challenging in urban environments where the surrounding area has already been heavily developed or where steep embankments prevent landward encroachment stralberg et al 2011 thorne et al 2018 at nisqually inland expansion is prevented by the i 5 corridor at the southern end of the study area and by escarpments to the east and west clearly the nrd is faced with its own set of limitations and challenges that may differ from other focal systems underscoring the need for more flexible monitoring based decision support tools our empirical model projected a diverse set of outcomes when presented with different tidal level and sediment inputs however all models are abstractions of reality in hierarchical models with an iterative time step error may be propagated through time especially when contemporary datasets are used to project long term outcomes our model sensitivity analyses showed that distance from the nisqually river had a magnifying effect on yearly elevational change where iterations with higher sediment loads were likely to overestimate elevation change in areas farther from the river and underestimate elevation change in areas closer to the river projections were also higher for highly vegetated areas within 10 m of the tidal channel edge although they did not fall outside the range of observed set measurements fortunately the longitudinal sensitivity analysis indicated that error in the inundation soil pore salinity and vegetation components of mosaics was unlikely to propagate outside the range of variation that would otherwise be expected based on year to year fluctuations in suspended sediment only model error in the elevation change component itself appeared to have notable effect on the final predicted output the mosaics model provides a reasonable representation of future habitat conditions despite potential spatial and temporal errors because its output is intermediate to other marsh accretion models for example projections for the year 2100 showed slightly more retention of relict marsh habitat under moderate and high slr scenarios than warmer model estimates by thorne et al 2018 but considerably more habitat loss than earlier slamm models which forecasted that almost all the restored and relict marsh would persist through the end of the 21st century glick et al 2007 discrepancies among models shed light on the need for a comparative analysis that evaluates tradeoffs in simplicity accuracy generalizability cost and ease of use with regards to mosaics its application to other estuaries would require basic to intermediate experience with non linear models and maximum likelihood estimation and the required data could be a constraint for estuaries that do not already have focused monitoring programs in place nevertheless our study has demonstrated the potential utility of the mosaics decision support tool for using site specific monitoring data to project changes to the estuarine habitat mosaic under varying conditions especially for river deltas where elevation change is dominated by inputs of inorganic sediment 5 conclusion empirically based decision support tools that allow for multiple climate change and management scenarios are important for restoration planning especially given the threat of global slr managers rarely have the opportunity to manipulate suspended sediment inputs on a whole estuary scale thom 2000 teal and weishar 2005 callaway et al 2007 however adaptive reservoir management options to increase sediment delivery to sediment deficient river deltas may help ameliorate the effects of slr on marsh sustainability lee et al 2016 at nisqually this was especially true for the subsided restoration area which was predicted to be less resilient than the adjacent relict marsh due to its lower starting elevations and lack of vegetative complexity we expect this will be true of other systems in which the marsh plain is subsided and or degraded as such managers would benefit from considering long term mitigation actions before construction even begins simenstad et al 2006 sediment and stream gauge data are now available for most waterways in online repositories allowing planners to assess whether current suspended sediment inputs will be sufficient to promote viable accretion rates and how they might be affected by future drought and flooding events by incorporating empirical monitoring datasets into ecological models and simplifying decision support tools for ease of use we can improve the adaptive

dendrogram s goodness of fit and the agglomerative coefficient to measure its degree of clustering a scree plot of similarity was examined to determine the optimal number of vegetation communities i e habitat types in the best fit clustering solution to estimate the optimal elevation range for eelgrass growth we used 2012 2015 presence absence data from the puget sound submerged vegetation monitoring project https www dnr wa gov programs and services aquatics aquatic science nearshore habitat eelgrass monitoring to determine the mean and standard deviation range of elevations for which the ratio of shoot presence to shoot absence was greater than 1 1 results a comparison of several clustering methods determined that the average linkage method had the greatest cophenetic correlation coefficient centroid 0 68 median 0 55 average 0 72 ward s 0 70 however ward s method produced the highest agglomerative coefficient centroid 0 87 median 0 82 average 0 80 ward s 0 98 a rand index value of 0 84 supported a high degree of similarity between the average and ward s clustering methods because our objective was to group vegetation species into distinct communities we chose to use ward s minimum variance as the best fit clustering solution the scree plot showed that partitioning the dendrogram into 6 habitat types offered the most appropriate degree of separation the species

24991,trends of increasing human population diets rich in meat highly processed and vigorously transported products put high pressure on our ability to produce ever more food globally at the same time as supporting healthy agricultural ecosystems globally future food production needs to focus on optimisation of the food system in order to develop within the constraints of planetary boundaries modelling of energy and material flows of production systems by means of emergy assessment is a way to help in this task we model and assess a hypothetical large scale biorefinery production from field to the provision of pig feed biogas and fertiliser based on grass clover mixtures bioref scenario a hot spot analysis concludes that grass clover mixture cultivation has high diesel and labour requirements and that approximately half of the resource use in solar emjoules sej in the bioref scenario occurs during agricultural production we find that the bioref scenario is very labour intensive 75 of total resource use in sej year is related to labour next we compare the bioref scenario to the current provision in denmark of soy meal imported from brazil combined with natural gas from denmark current scenario we conclude that the bioref production system could reduce the use of resources reduce the dependence on non renewable resources significantly decrease ghg emissions from fossil fuel use and does not need external heat input but has higher diesel and electricity use increased land demand and much more dependence on labour embodied in goods finally we discuss different perspectives in relation to labour requirements for the two production systems keywords biogas biorefinery feed grass clover mixture emergy labour 1 introduction trends toward increasing human population diets rich in meat highly processed and vigorously transported products put high pressure on our ability to produce ever more food globally at the same time as supporting healthy agricultural ecosystems globally future food production needs to focus on systemic optimisation in order to develop within the constraints of planetary boundaries heck et al 2018 e g by using local renewable resources as well as local recycling godfray et al 2010 current agricultural production building on access to relatively plentiful amounts of fossil oil not only connects food producers with the global market it also allows for extensive transport of agricultural products e g animal feed for meat and dairy production the present global economic framework encourages import of feed from across the world in pursuit of higher productivity and it is a driver of regionally concentrated monoculture production is this strategy also advantageous when environmental issues are taken into account trading today does not account directly for impacts on the environment where production takes place nor during transportation further the consequences of global imbalances in natural resource use which may radically influence local ecosystems are seldom dealt with in monetary terms furthermore re localising the supply of feed might have indirect effects that go beyond resource use and pollution issues e g in terms of strategic importance support for regional and domestic economies and cultural value including the transfer of locally adaptive production skills satterthwaite et al 2010 however even if local or domestic products do tend to reduce transport this advantage may be lost if the impacts of local production are substantially larger than impacts from production of the imported product denmark imports significant quantities of soy feed both as soybean and soy meal for the country s large pig production a novel utilisation of local grass clover mixtures with high protein productivity for co production of pig feed biogas and fertiliser could improve environmental sustainability of feed provision by re localising production the produced protein concentrates from grass clover mixtures also known as leaf protein concentrate have been suggested and studied for many years as a possible protein feed for monogastric animals and food for human consumption pirie 1987 leaf protein concentrate has the same protein content as soy meal and approximately the same amino acid profile and it is therefore reasonable to consider it as an alternative feed product to soy meal stødkilde et al 2018 for the past years the production of leaf protein concentrates from grass clover has been developed and evaluated as an alternative protein feed for monogastric animals in denmark corona et al 2018a b hermansen et al 2017 santamaria fernandez et al 2019 the motivation for the development in denmark is not only the possibility for local protein production but also indeed the agricultural and environmental benefits associated with establishing more perennial grass clover mixtures such as decreased nutrient leaching and pesticide usage and increased carbon sequestration hermansen et al 2017 at the same time the separation of leaf protein concentrates from grass clover mixtures supports the production of biogas and fertiliser by anaerobic digestion of the other outputs from the separation of the protein concentrate i e the fibrous pulp fraction and the residual liquid increased biogas production could reduce dependence on natural gas planned to be phased out in denmark over the next decades the organic fertiliser in the slurry from the biogas production holds the potential to replace substantial amounts of synthetic fertiliser and thus reduce the environmental cost of synthetic fertiliser production which requires large energy inputs pelletier et al 2011 the proposed localisation of protein concentrate production is thus an attempt to introduce a new biorefinery approach defined by processing of biomass into a spectrum of bio based products food feed chemicals materials and bioenergy biofuels power and or heat iea task 42 the first objective of this study is to investigate the environmental hot spots of a suggested danish biorefinery production concept providing pig feed biogas and fertiliser from locally grown grass clover mixtures the second objective is to compare the environmental profile of this biorefinery concept to the current situation with imported soy meal from brazil and danish natural gas global and local transport has an influence on the environmental sustainability of feed as shown for soy export from brazil prudêncio da silva et al 2010 is it possible to reduce feed production impacts by localising the production several life cycle assessment lca studies indicate that the use in pig diets of soybeans from south america may have a negative impact on the environment for a review see mcauliffe et al 2016 the general conclusion reached is that the environmental impacts may be reduced by replacing imported protein feed with locally produced crops in the pig producing country potentially including synthetic feed use amino acids specific examples include import of soybean products from brazil to france mosnier et al 2011 and uk stephen 2012 the conclusions reached in the mentioned studies are not directly transferable to a comparison of feed produced in a biorefinery with alternative feed products this is because a biorefinery production involves a more comprehensive multi product approach as well as the agricultural production of the feedstock agricultural production processes are highly complex socio economic systems embedded in and depending very much on corresponding ecological support systems most standardised life cycle assessments focus on human controlled processes and may thereby overlook natural system elements with crucial function in the agricultural production complete system analyses need to include the nature controlled processes that create and provide the energy and material flows necessary as part of this it is important to keep track of labour inputs since the provision of labour is associated with resource use kamp et al 2016a for these reasons we base our analysis upon emergy assessment ema which includes contributions from natural processes as well as labour odum 1996 since part of the motivation for the suggested technology is the reduction of energy use and substitution of fossil energy carriers we specify the requirements of diesel gas and electricity inputs further we account for ghg emissions from the use of fossil energy separately since ema is currently not suited for evaluating this usually environmental assessments of production technologies ignore labour possibly because the consumption of a labourer and therefore the related environmental impacts are considered to be either negligible in comparison with other inputs or independent from the particular task the labour is directed at we have an opposing perspective on this and use this study to exemplify the role labour inputs play in an environmental assessment an interesting aspect in this case study is that we compare production in countries with very different living standards as measured in monetary terms using gdp average of 8 650 us cap in brazil and 53 600 us cap in denmark in 2010 nead 2 0 moreover wealth is less equally distributed in brazil world bank in addition the economies of the two countries rely on significantly different biophysical resources this means that labour inputs of the same type in the two countries are associated with different environmental support when considering substitution of biomass production in denmark for biomass production in brazil the difference in living standard and resource basis may be expected to influence the environmental assessment and thereby the decision a third objective of this study is therefore to investigate the labour inputs required for the two production systems and analyse and interpret the effect of the resource use associated with it 2 materials and methods 2 1 scope of the study and major assumptions the scope of this study is to assess the environmental impacts and labour requirements of a suggested danish biorefinery concept based on grass clover mixture as feedstock bioref scenario and compare this to the current way of providing similar products based on imported soy meal current scenario the results of our comparison are presented as a selection of socio economic and environmental impact indicators in the hot spot analysis of the biorefinery as well as in the comparison the indicators are scaled to production from a hypothetical biorefinery industry that produces leaf protein concentrate biogas and fertiliser from grass clover in the bioref scenario the suggested biorefinery industry produces 160 000 t of crude protein corresponding to the crude protein in 20 of conventional soy meal imported to denmark in 2015 it is assumed that grass clover mixture based protein feed containing one kg of crude protein is directly substitutable with one kg of crude protein in soy meal with respect to feed quality this is a reasonable assumption since the protein concentrate has the same protein content as soy meal approximately the same amino acid profile and is accepted by the animals showing normal feed intake rates stødkilde et al 2018 to provide this amount of crude protein through biorefining about 200 000 t grass clover mixture biomass is required which again requires approximately 180 000 ha of land we envision that 100 de central biorefineries each with a capacity around 20 000 tonnes dry matter biomass input per year are spread across denmark constituting a functional large scale implementation of the scenario the farms supplying the grass clover mixture are similarly spread across the country since the biorefinery produces upgraded biogas in excess of process energy requirements the functional unit includes 460 million m3 of upgraded gas delivered to the danish gas grid the biorefinery also produces de gassed material all of which is applied as fertiliser for the grass clover mixture production reducing the need for external supply hence the functional unit is 160 000 t of crude protein and 460 million m3 of gas delivered per year the theoretical basis for multiple outputs in the functional unit when comparing co production systems is outlined and discussed in bastianoni and marchettini 2000 and kamp and østergård 2013 in order to compare the two scenarios for supplying protein feed we have chosen a system expansion methodology this entails the addition of an output to the current scenario that matches upgraded biogas in terms of functionality by considering the provision of soy meal as well as natural gas we ensure that both compared systems adhere to the chosen functional unit the soy meal is imported from brazil the studied natural gas supply comes from denmark and the biogas is upgraded to be equivalent to this specific natural gas all significant inputs in biomass cultivation processing and transport as well as biogas and natural gas production are included in the assessment the system boundary extends until the point where the feed products leaf protein concentrate or soy meal are available for retail sale at the retailer in denmark and the gas biogas or natural gas is delivered to the danish gas grid empirical data span the period early 2000 s for soy production to 2018 for grass clover production the soy meal is in itself a co product of processing of soybean to biodiesel or other soy oil products an allocation of resource use and other environmental impacts between soy oil and meal has been applied as a starting point this allocation is by means of energy content i e we assume that the distribution of resource use etc is proportional to the energy content of soy meal and soy oil respectively 63 soy meal and 37 soy oil in a sensitivity analysis we test two other allocation methods i e by mass 81 and 19 or price 36 and 64 and by the emergy methodology based calculation where all emergy is required for each co product derived effects in the form of altered demand for agricultural commodities indirect land use changes and other market changes are not accounted for the supplementary material provides calculation assumptions as well as the reference source of all specific inputs readers are encouraged to contact the authors for additional information 2 2 studied production systems 2 2 1 biorefining of grass clover mixture in denmark bioref scenario in the bioref scenario fig 1 protein feed from grass clover mixture is co produced with biogas and fertiliser through eight stages of production crop production crop transport refining protein transport biogas production upgraded gas distribution slurry transport and slurry application part of the upgraded biogas is used for process heat and electricity in pressing protein concentration and biogas production and all the de gassed material is returned to the cultivated fields to substitute fertiliser the average transport distances are 10 km between farm and biorefinery and 50 km between biorefinery and retailer the biorefining process is comprised of several unit operations which are shown as pressing concentration and biogas production in fig 1 i maceration of freshly harvested grass clover ii pressing of the macerated biomass by screw press into a green juice and a press cake pulp fraction iii heat precipitation at 80 ᵒc of the soluble proteins in the green juice and separation by decanter centrifugation producing a protein concentrate and a residual juice iv drying of separated protein concentrate and v biogas production from both pulp and residual juice the mass balance and energy consumption of the biorefinery process are described in corona et al 2018a 2018b slight alterations in the biogas yield calculation factors have been used see supplementary material cultivation of grass clover mixtures in denmark is common and the data for grass clover mixture production have been found in cultivation guidelines and further details were acquired in an interview with an experienced farmer pers comm henrik refsgård olsen processing grass clover mixture to provide protein feed on the other hand is novel much of the data used for our calculations are based on experiments from a pilot scale facility at aarhus university foulum denmark see hermansen et al 2017 additional literature data are applied for calculations concerning biogas production and upgrading transport calculations are based on our assumptions regarding distances and mode of transport for more details see supplementary material 2 2 2 soy meal from brazil and natural gas from denmark current scenario in the current scenario fig 2 protein feed is supplied by means of soy meal import investigating soy meal cultivation and processing we have used data from a study of soybean production in brazil cavalett and ortega 2009 ortega 2005 supplemented with specific energy uses in soy processing studied by bosselmann and gylling 2014 and dalgaard et al 2008 we have assumed transport requirements using average distances of soy import from brazil to denmark from mogensen et al 2018 truck in brazil 1 200 km ship 12 000 km truck in denmark 100 km by combining these sources we assume we have representative data for current average soy meal import from brazil the production of soy meal and of natural gas are independent of each other as mentioned in section 2 1 natural gas is added to the current scenario to equalise the functionality of the two studied systems and allow for direct comparison in fig 2 natural gas provision is shown as a subsystem of the evaluated system indicated by dashed lines brown et al 2011 studied the resource requirements in natural gas formation based on an energy return on energy invested ratio of 20 to 1 lambert et al 2012 we estimate that natural gas production requires an additional 5 of natural gas as production input we have used the danish energy revision s price statistics to estimate the cost of natural gas production energitilsynet we refer to jensen 2009 for an estimate of the cost of gas distribution milling results in the co products soy meal and soy oil the fraction of inputs in soy production local transport and milling associated with soy oil is disregarded in the assessments based on allocation see 2 1 finally as the oil is not evaluated as part of the functional unit the end products it is shown in parenthesis in fig 2 2 3 environmental impact assessment the environmental impact assessment provides an estimate of several indicators based on emergy embodied energy in addition to the required land area the direct energy use and the ghg emissions from direct energy use 2 3 1 emergy resource use indicators based on emergy assessment ema emergy assessment ema is a method to estimate the embodied energy of any kind included in the products considered in ema all forms of energy materials and human labour that contribute directly or indirectly to a production process are taken into account and converted into the common unit of solar emjoules sej brown 2015 for the conversions we have used the 2016 geobiosphere emergy baseline 2016 geb of 12 0e 24 solar equivalent joules per year brown and ulgiati 2016 the conversions take place by multiplying physical quantities with their respective unit emergy values uev where the uev is the embodied energy or emergy per unit e g sej j sej g sej man hour often uevs given in sej j are referred to as transformities here we use uev throughout a high uev is indicative of large accumulated energy uses in the creation extraction transport manufacture etc of a given item the emergy value per year or empower is considered an estimate of yearly accumulated resource use so emergy and resource use are used interchangeably in the text it follows that more resource efficient processes result in lower uevs ema distinguishes between renewable and non renewable resources consumed and all inputs are categorised for their dependence on renewable and non renewable emergy kamp et al 2016b wright and østergård 2015 the 2016 geb uses a new way to calculate renewable input flows where the geobiosphere tripartite solar tide and geothermal emergy flows are summed and compared to the largest secondary and tertiary flow e g rain the driving energy for the cultivation is then the larger of these two values brown and ulgiati 2016 by definition the emergy of sun wind rain and geothermal heat is 100 renewable but the harnessing and transformation of this energy involves the use of inputs based on non renewable energy so e g agricultural products are not 100 renewable if for example 50 of the emergy of the weighted sum of inputs for a product is from these renewable sources then we conclude that the output is 50 renewable in this work we consider global renewability i e not only the renewability of processes taking place within the system boundary as it is often done in ema but also the renewability of inputs originating elsewhere in natural or landscape systems the inclusion of only local renewable flows appears sufficient since there is no import in the study of human technology based production systems however we find that it is necessary to include the renewable flows in background processes to avoid underestimation of the total actual contribution of renewable emergy in the studied system as an example we use the renewability of soy meal as calculated in brazil in addition to the renewability of inputs required in the transport of the soy meal to the retailer in denmark further we use the ema method to estimate the local supply fraction of a product i e the fraction of its emergy support that is locally sourced in this study meaning originating in denmark the localness of an input is a quantification of our knowledge of danish energy and agricultural production so this approach is not as developed as the calculation of renewability however we consider this an improvement over simply stating that a product originating in denmark is local even if components are produced somewhere else finally we also focus on the accounting of labour inputs with ema ema routinely accounts for what can be referred to as the biophysical cost of human labour a distinction is made between direct labour and indirect labour the latter is in ema literature also referred to as service for a detailed discussion see ulgiati and brown 2014 in this text labour refers to the combination of both direct and indirect labour unless specified direct labour takes place in the foreground of the assessment and includes the labour applied in agricultural production transport processing and distribution indirect labour takes place in the background i e in production systems that supply inputs to farming transport etc e g the machinery or fuels used the accounting of labour inputs in this study follows published guidelines kamp et al 2016a 2016b which are outlined here the resource use associated with direct labour is estimated with data on the material living standards as measured with emergy in brazil denmark and for a few transport activities using a global average the average material living standard is lower in brazil 3 3e 16 sej cap in 2010 nead 2 0 than in denmark 1 0e 17 sej cap in 2010 nead 2 0 on top of this wealth is distributed more unevenly the poorest 20 of the population appropriate 3 and 9 of total gdp in brazil and denmark respectively in order to differentiate emergy support of direct labour in different labour activities we assume that emergy is distributed according to a similar pattern this implies that e g one man hour of low income farm labour in brazil is associated with a significantly lower emergy support 4 6e 12 sej man hour than one man hour of low income farm labour in denmark 9 0e 13 sej man hour we multiply the estimated amount of labour required for certain tasks with the emergy support per man hour that we consider appropriate for the specific type of labour indirect labour accompanies purchased goods and services as a monetary cost that we convert into an estimate of man hours this type of labour analysis is still in its infancy we do not know the exact location of indirect labour inputs and therefore we assume that all types of indirect labour are equally dependent on the world s emergy support first we convert the monetary cost of a purchased input to man hours using the global emergy support and an estimate of the global work force in man hours this conversion allows for comparison with direct labour also stated in man hours second we estimate the emergy support of indirect labour inputs again by using a global average this average is calculated as the global emergy flow divided with the global amount of work hours the amount of emergy that supports direct as well as indirect labour is differentiated across different labour categories due to different degrees of education salaries and material living standards of the labourers to exemplify one danish man hour of farm or transportation labour is associated with less emergy support than one danish man hour of biorefinery labour the calculation notes provide the numbers used in these calculations supplementary material we highlight the importance of labour inputs by calculating each indicator with and without labour inputs this permits further use of results where other labour accounting methods may be applied in addition we calculate the fraction of total emergy that is in the form of labour and how labour inputs in hours and resource use respectively is distributed over the different stages of production 2 3 2 land area use land area use is calculated as the hectares of land area required to produce the yield of grass clover mixture and soybean respectively required to provide 160 000 t crude protein the land area for provision of the danish natural gas is negligible compared to the agricultural land area and thus not included 2 3 3 direct energy use direct energy use is found in three categories of energy carriers these are liquid fuels in cultivation and transport given in litres of diesel diesel and minor amounts of bunker fuel are added for simplicity electricity in cultivation and processing is given in mwh and heat energy in processing is given in m3 of natural gas 2 3 4 greenhouse gas ghg emissions the assessment of ghg emissions is limited to emissions associated with the use of energy carriers in cultivation transport and processing activities we have used the following emission factors 3 5 kg co2 eq l diesel based on 92 g co2 eq mj and 38 mj l 2 5 kg co2 eq m3 natural gas or upgraded biogas with the same methane ch4 content based on 65 g co2 eq mj and 39 mj m3 and 0 52 kg co2 eq kwh electricity see supplementary material for calculations and references the emission factors include process energy for the production of the energy carriers additional ghg emissions do occur from gas spills carbon losses during soil treatment and process energy in the production of other material inputs these emissions can be substantial but to include them would require a much broader scope than the one we have applied carbon is released when upgraded biogas is used some of the upgraded gas is used for process energy and the rest is an output that is expected to be used beyond our system boundary we do not consider the ghg emissions from upgraded biogas used as process energy since they are biogenic i e they do not add to the atmosphere s ghg concentration in the relevant timescale however in our comparison with natural gas in the current scenario we do account for the fossil ghg that will eventually be released when the natural gas is used this is necessary to indicate the potential fossil ghg emission reduction when substituting upgraded biogas for natural gas these potential co2 emissions are calculated based on gas volume gas density 0 824 kg m3 ch4 energinet and the mass composition of ch4 and co2 2 3 5 sensitivity analyses we consider the allocation of environmental burdens associated with soy production the efficiency of protein extraction from grass clover the grass clover mixture yield and the uev and renewability fraction of labour inputs to be the most uncertain factors in our sustainability assessment the effects of altered assumptions regarding allocation basis yield and extraction efficiency are studied in a sensitivity analysis and results are presented with and without labour inputs 3 results and discussion 3 1 bioref scenario hot spot analysis main biophysical inputs required for producing 160 000 t of crude protein and 460 million m3 of gas in a year the functional unit are shown in table 1 this production requires 180 000 ha of land and a large number of farms and 100 biorefineries distributed across the country gross energy and fertiliser requirements are in fact higher than the amounts stated in table 1 a total of 240 million m3 of upgraded biogas is used internally for process heat and electricity in the 100 biorefineries constituting around a third of the total gas production in the biorefineries the return of 100 000 tonnes of nutrients in de gassed material applied to fields reduces the need for synthetic fertiliser by 93 in the following the assessment of emergy across the value chain consisting of the eight stages of production in the bioref scenario is shown in figs 3 and 4 and table 2 to get the best overview of the results the full emergy table is only shown in supplementary material and all numbers refers to this table the assessment ranks crop production biogas production and refining as the most resource demanding stages fig 3a this is mainly due to labour which in itself constitutes 60 of the crop production total emergy 98 of the refining total emergy and 94 of the biogas production total emergy overall labour inputs account for 75 of the total resource use emergy for providing feed and biogas as the total emergy including labour is 2 4e 21 sej year and only 0 6e 21 without labour fig 3 of the remaining 25 of emergy inputs most material resources are used in cultivation some material resource use occurs in biogas production and application of de gassed material fig 3b diesel use is the single largest contributor after labour 10 of total emergy this reflects the high amounts of diesel necessary for field activities rain and irrigation water are the second and third most important material inputs see supplementary material the application of de gassed material also involves plenty of diesel use while the material resource use in biogas production is mainly in infrastructure i e steel and concrete the emergy support accumulates when more processes are included table 2 on the contrary the renewability and largely also the local fraction of the output produced decrease for each consecutive stage table 2 this demonstrates that the resource use in the biorefinery processes the later stages of production in the value chain is based mainly on non local non renewable inputs contrasting the resource use in the crop production the first stage of production in the value chain further in all stages of production the uev including labour is more than twice the uev without labour reflecting that labour inputs dominate over material inputs in fact indirect labour constitutes the single largest input in each stage this reflects that material inputs including fuels machinery and infrastructure carry substantial amounts of indirect labour the comparison of labour requirements in hours across the value chain fig 4 clearly shows how indirect labour red bars exceeds to a large degree direct labour blue bars in terms of man hours this means that the vast majority of labour inputs occurs upstream of the biorefinery production system much of this indirect labour is carried out outside of denmark partly explaining why the local supply fraction is much lower when labour is included table 2 direct labour requirements in hours are largest in crop production 33 of all direct labour hours grass clover mixture is a demanding crop in the sense that harvest occurs several times over the season in this study we expect that four harvests is the norm second most direct labour is found in biogas production 23 followed by crop transport 13 grass clover mixture refining 12 and the return of slurry 10 the distribution of indirect labour hours is slightly different here the inputs from crop production constitutes more than 50 of the total indirect labour whereas those from biogas production are nearly 20 and for refining nearly 15 in general indirect labour input is relatively high when activities rely on relatively sophisticated external inputs this is true for crop production biogas production and refining where relatively high tech machinery is used the production of this machinery draws heavily on workers somewhere in the global economy when labour inputs are shown based on resource use emergy in sej year the pattern is similar see supplementary material in addition total indirect labour requires more resources than total direct labour even if indirect labour is based on an average global living standard and therefore associated with less resource use per man hour 3 2 current scenario analysis the current scenario consists of two independent parts crude protein provided by brazilian soy meal and the energy carrier danish natural gas an agricultural area of 150 000 ha is required for the soy meal production and 4 6e 08 m3 year of natural gas as energy table 3 of the total emergy support for this scenario with and without labour 81 and 78 respectively are used for the production of natural gas the emergy required for the natural gas is mainly non renewable and local and therefore this contributes considerably to the combined indicators 3 3 comparison between the two scenarios the two production systems are compared by means of a number of indicators the production of protein and biogas from danish grass clover mixture in a danish biorefinery has a number of advantages and disadvantages compared to import of soy meal protein from brazil combined with production of natural gas in denmark primarily production in the bioref scenario requires fewer resources when compared in a systems perspective 2 4e 21 sej versus 3 4e 21 sej table 4 if on the other hand the production of crude protein is considered in a single product perspective i e regardless of the co produced biogas and the added natural gas a different picture emerges in fact the crude protein production on its own requires 2 4e 21 sej year in the bioref scenario with labour included whereas it requires only 0 6 e 21 sej year in the current scenario see supplementary material when the two production systems are compared the bioref scenario is supported by a higher share of renewable inputs 23 versus 5 when compared to the current scenario table 4 the resource use per unit of output is 110 000 sej j approximately 40 lower for the biorefinery based production system than for soy meal and natural gas system according to our method of defining what constitutes local products the biorefinery delivers products that are less local 33 versus 80 since the current scenario relies heavily on danish natural gas and the bioref scenario relies on substantial amounts of indirect labour the biorefinery based production system depends on significantly higher direct energy inputs of diesel 33e 6 l versus 16e 6 l and electricity 36 gw h versus 5 9 gw h but requires no external gas table 4 55 of the diesel use in the current scenario is in transport while only 10 is for transport in bioref when the three energy carriers are combined the difference is 0 2 pj 1 4 pj versus 1 6 pj constituting a 12 improvement in bioref compared to current scenario this indicates that a change to the studied local biorefinery scenario based on grass clover mixture in itself does not reduce the global use of fossil fuels considerably however when the methane in the upgraded biogas as well as in the natural gas is combusted co2 is released the carbon in the upgraded biogas is biogenic i e relatively recently taken out of the atmosphere in the relevant time scale but the natural gas in the current scenario releases more than a million tonnes of fossil carbon dioxide combustion of methane emits approx 2 3 kg co2 per m3 this is a crucial difference in the comparison of the two production systems in favour of bioref concerning labour inputs much labour is required in both scenarios approx 110 million man hours versus 20 mill man hours but much more in the bioref scenario table 4 this large difference is due to differences in the use of indirect labour since the labour requirement in each of the countries direct labour is not that different 2 0 mill versus 2 1 mill man hours this means that in denmark bioref it is possible to produce 160 000 t of crude protein feed and 460 mill m3 upgraded gas with the same degree of direct employment as for soy from brazil coupled with natural gas from denmark current if actual man hours worked per unit of physical output is taken as a measure of labour efficiency the danish and the brazilian danish systems are practically equally efficient when it comes to labour measured in emergy however bioref is less resource efficient i e more resources are required to obtain the same physical output 2 5e 20 sej versus 0 3e 20 sej additionally much more indirect labour is required in the bioref scenario 15e 20 sej versus 2 5e 20 sej one explanation for this could be that the high tech machinery and infrastructure necessary for the suggested biorefinery production requires a lot of work outside the system boundary it appears that the productivity of 2 0 million man hours of direct labour in denmark is dependent on 110 million man hours elsewhere in the global economy this labour input contributes to global employment but is at the same time associated with its own use of resources the ratio of indirect labour to direct labour is 55 in the bioref scenario and only 9 in the current scenario altogether our study supports the conclusion reached by former lca studies that feed production involving local crops may contribute less to some environmental impacts when compared to imported soybean based feed in france mosnier et al 2011 and uk stephen 2012 however as also emphasised by the review study mcauliffe et al 2016 comparisons of results from different production systems should be considered with caution due to many different assumptions 3 4 sensitivity analyses we have changed some of the calculation parameters of the bioref scenario to evaluate the importance for the conclusion of the comparison highlights are inserted as tables 5 and 6 full results are in supplementary material first we considered the importance of the crop yield since it appears within reach to obtain higher yields of grass clover due to improvements in crop varieties or farming practices table 5 increasing the yield from 11 160 kg ha year to 12 160 kg ha year resulted in 6 8 improvements in direct energy use area demand and ghg emission while all other indicators changed less than 5 second we looked at the refining and increased the protein content of harvested clover grass mixture from 20 to 22 of dry matter content as well as the efficiency of separating the protein from the juice into the protein concentrate from 90 to 98 this led to 16 17 improvements in most indicators third we considered that the increase in protein content from 20 to 22 could be obtained through earlier harvest of the grass clover mixture and thus allowing for an additional harvest per season 5 cuts therefore the aforementioned changes in protein content and separation efficiency were accompanied by an extra harvest we coupled an additional harvest with a lower total crop yield since growth is expected to be reduced due to earlier harvest the result showed that the additional work of a fifth harvest and the lower yield does not out balance the benefits from increased protein content and separation efficiency altogether these adjustments caused changes in the bioref scenario assessment results that are relatively small compared to the difference between the two scenarios so the conclusions of the comparison is considered to be robust with respect to the robustness of the results of the current scenario we altered the methodology for distributing the environmental burden between the co products from soy production table 6 there is no correct way to allocate the environmental burden between outputs from co production systems kamp and østergård 2013 as default we have allocated 63 of the environmental impacts to soy meal based on energy content because we focus on energy significant changes in the assessment results occurred when changing to mass based allocation 81 to soy meal price allocation 36 to soy meal and allocation according to emergy algebra 100 to soy meal changes were biggest for electricity labour and diesel use because most of these inputs are used prior to the mill where oil and meal take separate paths the renewability fraction was also affected significantly because soy production is much more dependent on renewable inputs than natural gas this means that even if soy meal requires a minor part of the total resource use in the current scenario even smaller changes will influence the total renewability fraction in spite of the difference in results when changing the allocation method it is of less importance for the conclusion of the comparison between the two scenarios 4 conclusions and perspectives this case study aimed at investigating three aspects of the environmental and socio economic labour impacts of provision of pig feed and gas for the gas grid in denmark by comparing the current situation to a hypothetical biorefinery concept the bioref production system in this case study reduces the use of resources reduces the dependence on non renewable resources and significantly decreases ghg emissions from fossil fuel use without any external heat input however it also has higher diesel and electricity use increased land demand and depends much more on labour embodied in goods indirect labour the conclusion thus depends on stakeholder preferences but the results indicate that there are significant environmental benefits in discontinuing soy meal import and natural gas use if the biorefinery production can be implemented along the suggested lines 4 1 hot spot analysis of the biorefinery concept the first objective of the study is to investigate the environmental hot spots of a suggested danish biorefinery production concept providing pig feed biogas and fertiliser from locally grown grass clover mixtures the results of the assessment of the bioref scenario indicates that the hot spots for resource use are to be found in the crop production grass clover production is critically dependent on use of diesel and large requirements for labour embodied in machinery indirect labour diesel consumption may in the future be reduced by using renewable energy to power agricultural machinery e g biogas tractors or automated robot machinery with much higher fuel efficiency this does not ensure however a reduction in the required indirect labour and may therefore not be less costly automated machinery may be a game changer for the bioref scenario technology since harvesting can be carried out more or less continuously this allows for optimising the timing of harvest to reach the highest protein content in the grass clover mixture the suggested local production of protein feed from grass clover mixture requires a significant agricultural area for the primary production in this study the area needed for 20 substitution of danish protein import equals 180 000 ha i e 7 of denmark s farmland there is no available land so the extension of grass clover cultivation must substitute current land use however this is a likely consequence of the regulatory efforts in the european union under the eu water framework directive eu in order to reduce nutrient leaching and avoid unproductive fallow land one way of keeping biomass production while reducing nutrient leaching would be to substitute current traditional annual cropping systems with perennial cropping systems based on grasses and grass clover mixtures introduction of such a production of perennial green crops could have significant positive environmental effects locally compared to the present agricultural production which is dominated by grain and other annuals and monoculture methods these benefits include a carbon building and less nutrient leaching agriculture there is clear evidence that changing from winter wheat or maize to either grass clover or fertilised ryegrass results in decreased n leaching and decreased greenhouse gas emissions when the difference in soil carbon storage is taken into account larsen et al 2017 manevski et al 2018 the consequences for soil carbon increases and reduced n leaching have not been dealt with in this assessment a full study is required for an analysis of these topics the report by hermansen et al 2017 concludes that it is realistic to consider a grass or grass clover production area for biorefinery purposes of 400 000 ha yr in denmark and that this would have large environmental benefits however even with only 20 import substitution about 100 biorefinery facilities must be established and 180 000 ha converted which is a massive undertaking the optimal logistics and implementation scenarios of this kind of biorefineries are still debated and most likely it will not be a one solution fits all but has to be adapted for specific local conditions of biomass availability and product utilisation an alternative implementation scenario from the one investigated in this study could be to divide the processing steps of juice pressing and protein separation from the juice in this case a large number of farmers most likely dairy farmers install simple equipment for pressing and the extracted juice is transported to a few centralised protein feed production facilities similar to the setup in milk production this would reduce transport of the fibre fraction which is at least 40 of the total weight and 70 of the dry matter a strategy with pressing facilities in farm scale would be an even further step towards localisation in such a production system the pulp would be available on farm perhaps for smaller scale biogas production but more probably for livestock feed how this would change the overall comparison is the objective of further research the production system in this study focuses on two products protein feed and biogas however the concept of biorefining implies that there are possibilities for many other product combinations the fibre fraction has been shown to be a suitable feed for ruminants specifically for dairy cows substituting whole crop grass clover silage or maize silage furthermore the residual juice could be concentrated and used for media and substrate in the biotech industry thus adding to the revenue of the biorefinery and influencing other markets than those analysed herein such new product scenarios would change the assessment and should be part of future work as the biorefining technology is developed 4 2 comparison of the two scenarios the second objective of the study is to compare the environmental profile of this biorefinery concept to the current situation with imported soy meal from brazil and danish natural gas it has been debated whether local production and consumption lead to higher energy resource use efficiency pelletier et al 2011 in our case study the local choice the bioref scenario may be evaluated as the most sustainable with lower resource use lower dependence on non renewable resources significantly lower ghg emissions from fossil fuel use and no requirement of external heat input however it also implies higher diesel and electricity use higher land use and much higher indirect labour requirements the sensitivity analysis altering different production parameters and allocation assumptions concludes that the obtained results are robust how to decide which production system would be the best to use as strategy for development depends on the stakeholder therefore one number combining the different indicators is not provided it must be expected that feed price will be the central decision parameter for danish pig farmers if the socio economic benefits indicated in this study should be realised with the support of farmers a price incentive may be needed at least to get the industry started the high diesel usage in management of grass clover compared to soy should not be an argument preventing to get the other environmental benefits of local production resulting in reduced use of fossil fuels as mentioned diesel consumption may in general be reduced by different mechanisms like automated robot machinery in agriculture with much higher fuel efficiency as well as use of biogas in tractors such changes may happen sooner in denmark than in brazil a larger perspective comes from speculating over the possible future political regulatory and societal development we might expect increases in the cost of transport fuels regulation of the shipping industry to reduce atmospheric pollution phasing out of fossil fuels in general and popular movements in support of less harmful production methods and home grown products even if localisation involves less global specialisation these trends appear to work in favour of a perennial agricultural system and bio based energy system like the one envisioned 4 3 labour requirements a third objective of this study was to investigate the labour inputs required for the two production systems and analyse and interpret the effect of the resource use associated with it the amount of man hours used directly in the bioref scenario is similar to that in the current scenario somewhat surprisingly there is a striking difference in the amount of work done in the background of the studied systems i e the indirect labour put in elsewhere to provide the materials used we estimate that approximately six times as much indirect labour is required in the bioref scenario suggesting that bioref is considerably more labour intensive when both types of labour are included the ratio of indirect labour to direct labour in man hours is 55 in the bioref scenario and only 9 in the current scenario a high ratio probably characterises production systems with high tech sophisticated and automated machinery such production systems require less direct labour to manage and we typically regard them as highly productive ignoring that they are based on the support of much labour in other places an interesting question arises when this line of thinking is extended to the comparison of countries is a high ratio of indirect to direct labour an indicator of living standard and or trade power when assessing the labour inputs by emergy instead of man hours direct labour use differs between the production systems this is because a specific kind of labour in denmark is associated with a higher emergy support per labour input than the same kind of labour in brazil and most of the direct labour inputs in the current scenario occurs in brazil this difference does not apply to the indirect labour which is based on a global average emergy support per man hour when we use emergy to assess the resource use supporting the labour required to provide the studied outputs we find that approximately seven times as many resources are required to support the labour in bioref in some perspectives high labour demand is attractive occupation is a fundamental marker of sense of belonging and well being and most if not all governments consider high employment among their core objectives in contrast companies typically intend to reduce labour inputs e g through mechanisation to reduce direct labour inputs and in the continued search for material inputs that are produced more cost efficiently i e with less indirect labour we do not intend to debate if more or less employment is better however when we associate direct as well as indirect labour inputs with a resource cost it becomes apparent that technologies with fewer labour inputs and all else equal support the objective to reduce resource use the studied comparison indicates that three important mechanisms are at work first material inputs can be reduced but increased labour inputs may outbalance the total resource use supporting the technology secondly direct labour may be reduced but this may result in increased dependence on indirect labour and therefore possibly higher overall resource use finally if production in places with relatively low resource use per capita or man hour is substituted by production in places with high resource use per capita the resource use may increase even if there appears to be gains in terms of labour productivity we find that differences in direct and indirect labour requirements and in the resource base of labour inputs based on location are important factors to consider we hope that future studies comparing the environmental effect

24991,trends of increasing human population diets rich in meat highly processed and vigorously transported products put high pressure on our ability to produce ever more food globally at the same time as supporting healthy agricultural ecosystems globally future food production needs to focus on optimisation of the food system in order to develop within the constraints of planetary boundaries modelling of energy and material flows of production systems by means of emergy assessment is a way to help in this task we model and assess a hypothetical large scale biorefinery production from field to the provision of pig feed biogas and fertiliser based on grass clover mixtures bioref scenario a hot spot analysis concludes that grass clover mixture cultivation has high diesel and labour requirements and that approximately half of the resource use in solar emjoules sej in the bioref scenario occurs during agricultural production we find that the bioref scenario is very labour intensive 75 of total resource use in sej year is related to labour next we compare the bioref scenario to the current provision in denmark of soy meal imported from brazil combined with natural gas from denmark current scenario we conclude that the bioref production system could reduce the use of resources reduce the dependence on non renewable resources significantly decrease ghg emissions from fossil fuel use and does not need external heat input but has higher diesel and electricity use increased land demand and much more dependence on labour embodied in goods finally we discuss different perspectives in relation to labour requirements for the two production systems keywords biogas biorefinery feed grass clover mixture emergy labour 1 introduction trends toward increasing human population diets rich in meat highly processed and vigorously transported products put high pressure on our ability to produce ever more food globally at the same time as supporting healthy agricultural ecosystems globally future food production needs to focus on systemic optimisation in order to develop within the constraints of planetary boundaries heck et al 2018 e g by using local renewable resources as well as local recycling godfray et al 2010 current agricultural production building on access to relatively plentiful amounts of fossil oil not only connects food producers with the global market it also allows for extensive transport of agricultural products e g animal feed for meat and dairy production the present global economic framework encourages import of feed from across the world in pursuit of higher productivity and it is a driver of regionally concentrated monoculture production is this strategy also advantageous when environmental issues are taken into account trading today does not account directly for impacts on the environment where production takes place nor during transportation further the consequences of global imbalances in natural resource use which may radically influence local ecosystems are seldom dealt with in monetary terms furthermore re localising the supply of feed might have indirect effects that go beyond resource use and pollution issues e g in terms of strategic importance support for regional and domestic economies and cultural value including the transfer of locally adaptive production skills satterthwaite et al 2010 however even if local or domestic products do tend to reduce transport this advantage may be lost if the impacts of local production are substantially larger than impacts from production of the imported product denmark imports significant quantities of soy feed both as soybean and soy meal for the country s large pig production a novel utilisation of local grass clover mixtures with high protein productivity for co production of pig feed biogas and fertiliser could improve environmental sustainability of feed provision by re localising production the produced protein concentrates from grass clover mixtures also known as leaf protein concentrate have been suggested and studied for many years as a possible protein feed for monogastric animals and food for human consumption pirie 1987 leaf protein concentrate has the same protein content as soy meal and approximately the same amino acid profile and it is therefore reasonable to consider it as an alternative feed product to soy meal stødkilde et al 2018 for the past years the production of leaf protein concentrates from grass clover has been developed and evaluated as an alternative protein feed for monogastric animals in denmark corona et al 2018a b hermansen et al 2017 santamaria fernandez et al 2019 the motivation for the development in denmark is not only the possibility for local protein production but also indeed the agricultural and environmental benefits associated with establishing more perennial grass clover mixtures such as decreased nutrient leaching and pesticide usage and increased carbon sequestration hermansen et al 2017 at the same time the separation of leaf protein concentrates from grass clover mixtures supports the production of biogas and fertiliser by anaerobic digestion of the other outputs from the separation of the protein concentrate i e the fibrous pulp fraction and the residual liquid increased biogas production could reduce dependence on natural gas planned to be phased out in denmark over the next decades the organic fertiliser in the slurry from the biogas production holds the potential to replace substantial amounts of synthetic fertiliser and thus reduce the environmental cost of synthetic fertiliser production which requires large energy inputs pelletier et al 2011 the proposed localisation of protein concentrate production is thus an attempt to introduce a new biorefinery approach defined by processing of biomass into a spectrum of bio based products food feed chemicals materials and bioenergy biofuels power and or heat iea task 42 the first objective of this study is to investigate the environmental hot spots of a suggested danish biorefinery production concept providing pig feed biogas and fertiliser from locally grown grass clover mixtures the second objective is to compare the environmental profile of this biorefinery concept to the current situation with imported soy meal from brazil and danish natural gas global and local transport has an influence on the environmental sustainability of feed as shown for soy export from brazil prudêncio da silva et al 2010 is it possible to reduce feed production impacts by localising the production several life cycle assessment lca studies indicate that the use in pig diets of soybeans from south america may have a negative impact on the environment for a review see mcauliffe et al 2016 the general conclusion reached is that the environmental impacts may be reduced by replacing imported protein feed with locally produced crops in the pig producing country potentially including synthetic feed use amino acids specific examples include import of soybean products from brazil to france mosnier et al 2011 and uk stephen 2012 the conclusions reached in the mentioned studies are not directly transferable to a comparison of feed produced in a biorefinery with alternative feed products this is because a biorefinery production involves a more comprehensive multi product approach as well as the agricultural production of the feedstock agricultural production processes are highly complex socio economic systems embedded in and depending very much on corresponding ecological support systems most standardised life cycle assessments focus on human controlled processes and may thereby overlook natural system elements with crucial function in the agricultural production complete system analyses need to include the nature controlled processes that create and provide the energy and material flows necessary as part of this it is important to keep track of labour inputs since the provision of labour is associated with resource use kamp et al 2016a for these reasons we base our analysis upon emergy assessment ema which includes contributions from natural processes as well as labour odum 1996 since part of the motivation for the suggested technology is the reduction of energy use and substitution of fossil energy carriers we specify the requirements of diesel gas and electricity inputs further we account for ghg emissions from the use of fossil energy separately since ema is currently not suited for evaluating this usually environmental assessments of production technologies ignore labour possibly because the consumption of a labourer and therefore the related environmental impacts are considered to be either negligible in comparison with other inputs or independent from the particular task the labour is directed at we have an opposing perspective on this and use this study to exemplify the role labour inputs play in an environmental assessment an interesting aspect in this case study is that we compare production in countries with very different living standards as measured in monetary terms using gdp average of 8 650 us cap in brazil and 53 600 us cap in denmark in 2010 nead 2 0 moreover wealth is less equally distributed in brazil world bank in addition the economies of the two countries rely on significantly different biophysical resources this means that labour inputs of the same type in the two countries are associated with different environmental support when considering substitution of biomass production in denmark for biomass production in brazil the difference in living standard and resource basis may be expected to influence the environmental assessment and thereby the decision a third objective of this study is therefore to investigate the labour inputs required for the two production systems and analyse and interpret the effect of the resource use associated with it 2 materials and methods 2 1 scope of the study and major assumptions the scope of this study is to assess the environmental impacts and labour requirements of a suggested danish biorefinery concept based on grass clover mixture as feedstock bioref scenario and compare this to the current way of providing similar products based on imported soy meal current scenario the results of our comparison are presented as a selection of socio economic and environmental impact indicators in the hot spot analysis of the biorefinery as well as in the comparison the indicators are scaled to production from a hypothetical biorefinery industry that produces leaf protein concentrate biogas and fertiliser from grass clover in the bioref scenario the suggested biorefinery industry produces 160 000 t of crude protein corresponding to the crude protein in 20 of conventional soy meal imported to denmark in 2015 it is assumed that grass clover mixture based protein feed containing one kg of crude protein is directly substitutable with one kg of crude protein in soy meal with respect to feed quality this is a reasonable assumption since the protein concentrate has the same protein content as soy meal approximately the same amino acid profile and is accepted by the animals showing normal feed intake rates stødkilde et al 2018 to provide this amount of crude protein through biorefining about 200 000 t grass clover mixture biomass is required which again requires approximately 180 000 ha of land we envision that 100 de central biorefineries each with a capacity around 20 000 tonnes dry matter biomass input per year are spread across denmark constituting a functional large scale implementation of the scenario the farms supplying the grass clover mixture are similarly spread across the country since the biorefinery produces upgraded biogas in excess of process energy requirements the functional unit includes 460 million m3 of upgraded gas delivered to the danish gas grid the biorefinery also produces de gassed material all of which is applied as fertiliser for the grass clover mixture production reducing the need for external supply hence the functional unit is 160 000 t of crude protein and 460 million m3 of gas delivered per year the theoretical basis for multiple outputs in the functional unit when comparing co production systems is outlined and discussed in bastianoni and marchettini 2000 and kamp and østergård 2013 in order to compare the two scenarios for supplying protein feed we have chosen a system expansion methodology this entails the addition of an output to the current scenario that matches upgraded biogas in terms of functionality by considering the provision of soy meal as well as natural gas we ensure that both compared systems adhere to the chosen functional unit the soy meal is imported from brazil the studied natural gas supply comes from denmark and the biogas is upgraded to be equivalent to this specific natural gas all significant inputs in biomass cultivation processing and transport as well as biogas and natural gas production are included in the assessment the system boundary extends until the point where the feed products leaf protein concentrate or soy meal are available for retail sale at the retailer in denmark and the gas biogas or natural gas is delivered to the danish gas grid empirical data span the period early 2000 s for soy production to 2018 for grass clover production the soy meal is in itself a co product of processing of soybean to biodiesel or other soy oil products an allocation of resource use and other environmental impacts between soy oil and meal has been applied as a starting point this allocation is by means of energy content i e we assume that the distribution of resource use etc is proportional to the energy content of soy meal and soy oil respectively 63 soy meal and 37 soy oil in a sensitivity analysis we test two other allocation methods i e by mass 81 and 19 or price 36 and 64 and by the emergy methodology based calculation where all emergy is required for each co product derived effects in the form of altered demand for agricultural commodities indirect land use changes and other market changes are not accounted for the supplementary material provides calculation assumptions as well as the reference source of all specific inputs readers are encouraged to contact the authors for additional information 2 2 studied production systems 2 2 1 biorefining of grass clover mixture in denmark bioref scenario in the bioref scenario fig 1 protein feed from grass clover mixture is co produced with biogas and fertiliser through eight stages of production crop production crop transport refining protein transport biogas production upgraded gas distribution slurry transport and slurry application part of the upgraded biogas is used for process heat and electricity in pressing protein concentration and biogas production and all the de gassed material is returned to the cultivated fields to substitute fertiliser the average transport distances are 10 km between farm and biorefinery and 50 km between biorefinery and retailer the biorefining process is comprised of several unit operations which are shown as pressing concentration and biogas production in fig 1 i maceration of freshly harvested grass clover ii pressing of the macerated biomass by screw press into a green juice and a press cake pulp fraction iii heat precipitation at 80 ᵒc of the soluble proteins in the green juice and separation by decanter centrifugation producing a protein concentrate and a residual juice iv drying of separated protein concentrate and v biogas production from both pulp and residual juice the mass balance and energy consumption of the biorefinery process are described in corona et al 2018a 2018b slight alterations in the biogas yield calculation factors have been used see supplementary material cultivation of grass clover mixtures in denmark is common and the data for grass clover mixture production have been found in cultivation guidelines and further details were acquired in an interview with an experienced farmer pers comm henrik refsgård olsen processing grass clover mixture to provide protein feed on the other hand is novel much of the data used for our calculations are based on experiments from a pilot scale facility at aarhus university foulum denmark see hermansen et al 2017 additional literature data are applied for calculations concerning biogas production and upgrading transport calculations are based on our assumptions regarding distances and mode of transport for more details see supplementary material 2 2 2 soy meal from brazil and natural gas from denmark current scenario in the current scenario fig 2 protein feed is supplied by means of soy meal import investigating soy meal cultivation and processing we have used data from a study of soybean production in brazil cavalett and ortega 2009 ortega 2005 supplemented with specific energy uses in soy processing studied by bosselmann and gylling 2014 and dalgaard et al 2008 we have assumed transport requirements using average distances of soy import from brazil to denmark from mogensen et al 2018 truck in brazil 1 200 km ship 12 000 km truck in denmark 100 km by combining these sources we assume we have representative data for current average soy meal import from brazil the production of soy meal and of natural gas are independent of each other as mentioned in section 2 1 natural gas is added to the current scenario to equalise the functionality of the two studied systems and allow for direct comparison in fig 2 natural gas provision is shown as a subsystem of the evaluated system indicated by dashed lines brown et al 2011 studied the resource requirements in natural gas formation based on an energy return on energy invested ratio of 20 to 1 lambert et al 2012 we estimate that natural gas production requires an additional 5 of natural gas as production input we have used the danish energy revision s price statistics to estimate the cost of natural gas production energitilsynet we refer to jensen 2009 for an estimate of the cost of gas distribution milling results in the co products soy meal and soy oil the fraction of inputs in soy production local transport and milling associated with soy oil is disregarded in the assessments based on allocation see 2 1 finally as the oil is not evaluated as part of the functional unit the end products it is shown in parenthesis in fig 2 2 3 environmental impact assessment the environmental impact assessment provides an estimate of several indicators based on emergy embodied energy in addition to the required land area the direct energy use and the ghg emissions from direct energy use 2 3 1 emergy resource use indicators based on emergy assessment ema emergy assessment ema is a method to estimate the embodied energy of any kind included in the products considered in ema all forms of energy materials and human labour that contribute directly or indirectly to a production process are taken into account and converted into the common unit of solar emjoules sej brown 2015 for the conversions we have used the 2016 geobiosphere emergy baseline 2016 geb of 12 0e 24 solar equivalent joules per year brown and ulgiati 2016 the conversions take place by multiplying physical quantities with their respective unit emergy values uev where the uev is the embodied energy or emergy per unit e g sej j sej g sej man hour often uevs given in sej j are referred to as transformities here we use uev throughout a high uev is indicative of large accumulated energy uses in the creation extraction transport manufacture etc of a given item the emergy value per year or empower is considered an estimate of yearly accumulated resource use so emergy and resource use are used interchangeably in the text it follows that more resource efficient processes result in lower uevs ema distinguishes between renewable and non renewable resources consumed and all inputs are categorised for their dependence on renewable and non renewable emergy kamp et al 2016b wright and østergård 2015 the 2016 geb uses a new way to calculate renewable input flows where the geobiosphere tripartite solar tide and geothermal emergy flows are summed and compared to the largest secondary and tertiary flow e g rain the driving energy for the cultivation is then the larger of these two values brown and ulgiati 2016 by definition the emergy of sun wind rain and geothermal heat is 100 renewable but the harnessing and transformation of this energy involves the use of inputs based on non renewable energy so e g agricultural products are not 100 renewable if for example 50 of the emergy of the weighted sum of inputs for a product is from these renewable sources then we conclude that the output is 50 renewable in this work we consider global renewability i e not only the renewability of processes taking place within the system boundary as it is often done in ema but also the renewability of inputs originating elsewhere in natural or landscape systems the inclusion of only local renewable flows appears sufficient since there is no import in the study of human technology based production systems however we find that it is necessary to include the renewable flows in background processes to avoid underestimation of the total actual contribution of renewable emergy in the studied system as an example we use the renewability of soy meal as calculated in brazil in addition to the renewability of inputs required in the transport of the soy meal to the retailer in denmark further we use the ema method to estimate the local supply fraction of a product i e the fraction of its emergy support that is locally sourced in this study meaning originating in denmark the localness of an input is a quantification of our knowledge of danish energy and agricultural production so this approach is not as developed as the calculation of renewability however we consider this an improvement over simply stating that a product originating in denmark is local even if components are produced somewhere else finally we also focus on the accounting of labour inputs with ema ema routinely accounts for what can be referred to as the biophysical cost of human labour a distinction is made between direct labour and indirect labour the latter is in ema literature also referred to as service for a detailed discussion see ulgiati and brown 2014 in this text labour refers to the combination of both direct and indirect labour unless specified direct labour takes place in the foreground of the assessment and includes the labour applied in agricultural production transport processing and distribution indirect labour takes place in the background i e in production systems that supply inputs to farming transport etc e g the machinery or fuels used the accounting of labour inputs in this study follows published guidelines kamp et al 2016a 2016b which are outlined here the resource use associated with direct labour is estimated with data on the material living standards as measured with emergy in brazil denmark and for a few transport activities using a global average the average material living standard is lower in brazil 3 3e 16 sej cap in 2010 nead 2 0 than in denmark 1 0e 17 sej cap in 2010 nead 2 0 on top of this wealth is distributed more unevenly the poorest 20 of the population appropriate 3 and 9 of total gdp in brazil and denmark respectively in order to differentiate emergy support of direct labour in different labour activities we assume that emergy is distributed according to a similar pattern this implies that e g one man hour of low income farm labour in brazil is associated with a significantly lower emergy support 4 6e 12 sej man hour than one man hour of low income farm labour in denmark 9 0e 13 sej man hour we multiply the estimated amount of labour required for certain tasks with the emergy support per man hour that we consider appropriate for the specific type of labour indirect labour accompanies purchased goods and services as a monetary cost that we convert into an estimate of man hours this type of labour analysis is still in its infancy we do not know the exact location of indirect labour inputs and therefore we assume that all types of indirect labour are equally dependent on the world s emergy support first we convert the monetary cost of a purchased input to man hours using the global emergy support and an estimate of the global work force in man hours this conversion allows for comparison with direct labour also stated in man hours second we estimate the emergy support of indirect labour inputs again by using a global average this average is calculated as the global emergy flow divided with the global amount of work hours the amount of emergy that supports direct as well as indirect labour is differentiated across different labour categories due to different degrees of education salaries and material living standards of the labourers to exemplify one danish man hour of farm or transportation labour is associated with less emergy support than one danish man hour of biorefinery labour the calculation notes provide the numbers used in these calculations supplementary material we highlight the importance of labour inputs by calculating each indicator with and without labour inputs this permits further use of results where other labour accounting methods may be applied in addition we calculate the fraction of total emergy that is in the form of labour and how labour inputs in hours and resource use respectively is distributed over the different stages of production 2 3 2 land area use land area use is calculated as the hectares of land area required to produce the yield of grass clover mixture and soybean respectively required to provide 160 000 t crude protein the land area for provision of the danish natural gas is negligible compared to the agricultural land area and thus not included 2 3 3 direct energy use direct energy use is found in three categories of energy carriers these are liquid fuels in cultivation and transport given in litres of diesel diesel and minor amounts of bunker fuel are added for simplicity electricity in cultivation and processing is given in mwh and heat energy in processing is given in m3 of natural gas 2 3 4 greenhouse gas ghg emissions the assessment of ghg emissions is limited to emissions associated with the use of energy carriers in cultivation transport and processing activities we have used the following emission factors 3 5 kg co2 eq l diesel based on 92 g co2 eq mj and 38 mj l 2 5 kg co2 eq m3 natural gas or upgraded biogas with the same methane ch4 content based on 65 g co2 eq mj and 39 mj m3 and 0 52 kg co2 eq kwh electricity see supplementary material for calculations and references the emission factors include process energy for the production of the energy carriers additional ghg emissions do occur from gas spills carbon losses during soil treatment and process energy in the production of other material inputs these emissions can be substantial but to include them would require a much broader scope than the one we have applied carbon is released when upgraded biogas is used some of the upgraded gas is used for process energy and the rest is an output that is expected to be used beyond our system boundary we do not consider the ghg emissions from upgraded biogas used as process energy since they are biogenic i e they do not add to the atmosphere s ghg concentration in the relevant timescale however in our comparison with natural gas in the current scenario we do account for the fossil ghg that will eventually be released when the natural gas is used this is necessary to indicate the potential fossil ghg emission reduction when substituting upgraded biogas for natural gas these potential co2 emissions are calculated based on gas volume gas density 0 824 kg m3 ch4 energinet and the mass composition of ch4 and co2 2 3 5 sensitivity analyses we consider the allocation of environmental burdens associated with soy production the efficiency of protein extraction from grass clover the grass clover mixture yield and the uev and renewability fraction of labour inputs to be the most uncertain factors in our sustainability assessment the effects of altered assumptions regarding allocation basis yield and extraction efficiency are studied in a sensitivity analysis and results are presented with and without labour inputs 3 results and discussion 3 1 bioref scenario hot spot analysis main biophysical inputs required for producing 160 000 t of crude protein and 460 million m3 of gas in a year the functional unit are shown in table 1 this production requires 180 000 ha of land and a large number of farms and 100 biorefineries distributed across the country gross energy and fertiliser requirements are in fact higher than the amounts stated in table 1 a total of 240 million m3 of upgraded biogas is used internally for process heat and electricity in the 100 biorefineries constituting around a third of the total gas production in the biorefineries the return of 100 000 tonnes of nutrients in de gassed material applied to fields reduces the need for synthetic fertiliser by 93 in the following the assessment of emergy across the value chain consisting of the eight stages of production in the bioref scenario is shown in figs 3 and 4 and table 2 to get the best overview of the results the full emergy table is only shown in supplementary material and all numbers refers to this table the assessment ranks crop production biogas production and refining as the most resource demanding stages fig 3a this is mainly due to labour which in itself constitutes 60 of the crop production total emergy 98 of the refining total emergy and 94 of the biogas production total emergy overall labour inputs account for 75 of the total resource use emergy for providing feed and biogas as the total emergy including labour is 2 4e 21 sej year and only 0 6e 21 without labour fig 3 of the remaining 25 of emergy inputs most material resources are used in cultivation some material resource use occurs in biogas production and application of de gassed material fig 3b diesel use is the single largest contributor after labour 10 of total emergy this reflects the high amounts of diesel necessary for field activities rain and irrigation water are the second and third most important material inputs see supplementary material the application of de gassed material also involves plenty of diesel use while the material resource use in biogas production is mainly in infrastructure i e steel and concrete the emergy support accumulates when more processes are included table 2 on the contrary the renewability and largely also the local fraction of the output produced decrease for each consecutive stage table 2 this demonstrates that the resource use in the biorefinery processes the later stages of production in the value chain is based mainly on non local non renewable inputs contrasting the resource use in the crop production the first stage of production in the value chain further in all stages of production the uev including labour is more than twice the uev without labour reflecting that labour inputs dominate over material inputs in fact indirect labour constitutes the single largest input in each stage this reflects that material inputs including fuels machinery and infrastructure carry substantial amounts of indirect labour the comparison of labour requirements in hours across the value chain fig 4 clearly shows how indirect labour red bars exceeds to a large degree direct labour blue bars in terms of man hours this means that the vast majority of labour inputs occurs upstream of the biorefinery production system much of this indirect labour is carried out outside of denmark partly explaining why the local supply fraction is much lower when labour is included table 2 direct labour requirements in hours are largest in crop production 33 of all direct labour hours grass clover mixture is a demanding crop in the sense that harvest occurs several times over the season in this study we expect that four harvests is the norm second most direct labour is found in biogas production 23 followed by crop transport 13 grass clover mixture refining 12 and the return of slurry 10 the distribution of indirect labour hours is slightly different here the inputs from crop production constitutes more than 50 of the total indirect labour whereas those from biogas production are nearly 20 and for refining nearly 15 in general indirect labour input is relatively high when activities rely on relatively sophisticated external inputs this is true for crop production biogas production and refining where relatively high tech machinery is used the production of this machinery draws heavily on workers somewhere in the global economy when labour inputs are shown based on resource use emergy in sej year the pattern is similar see supplementary material in addition total indirect labour requires more resources than total direct labour even if indirect labour is based on an average global living standard and therefore associated with less resource use per man hour 3 2 current scenario analysis the current scenario consists of two independent parts crude protein provided by brazilian soy meal and the energy carrier danish natural gas an agricultural area of 150 000 ha is required for the soy meal production and 4 6e 08 m3 year of natural gas as energy table 3 of the total emergy support for this scenario with and without labour 81 and 78 respectively are used for the production of natural gas the emergy required for the natural gas is mainly non renewable and local and therefore this contributes considerably to the combined indicators 3 3 comparison between the two scenarios the two production systems are compared by means of a number of indicators the production of protein and biogas from danish grass clover mixture in a danish biorefinery has a number of advantages and disadvantages compared to import of soy meal protein from brazil combined with production of natural gas in denmark primarily production in the bioref scenario requires fewer resources when compared in a systems perspective 2 4e 21 sej versus 3 4e 21 sej table 4 if on the other hand the production of crude protein is considered in a single product perspective i e regardless of the co produced biogas and the added natural gas a different picture emerges in fact the crude protein production on its own requires 2 4e 21 sej year in the bioref scenario with labour included whereas it requires only 0 6 e 21 sej year in the current scenario see supplementary material when the two production systems are compared the bioref scenario is supported by a higher share of renewable inputs 23 versus 5 when compared to the current scenario table 4 the resource use per unit of output is 110 000 sej j approximately 40 lower for the biorefinery based production system than for soy meal and natural gas system according to our method of defining what constitutes local products the biorefinery delivers products that are less local 33 versus 80 since the current scenario relies heavily on danish natural gas and the bioref scenario relies on substantial amounts of indirect labour the biorefinery based production system depends on significantly higher direct energy inputs of diesel 33e 6 l versus 16e 6 l and electricity 36 gw h versus 5 9 gw h but requires no external gas table 4 55 of the diesel use in the current scenario is in transport while only 10 is for transport in bioref when the three energy carriers are combined the difference is 0 2 pj 1 4 pj versus 1 6 pj constituting a 12 improvement in bioref compared to current scenario this indicates that a change to the studied local biorefinery scenario based on grass clover mixture in itself does not reduce the global use of fossil fuels considerably however when the methane in the upgraded biogas as well as in the natural gas is combusted co2 is released the carbon in the upgraded biogas is biogenic i e relatively recently taken out of the atmosphere in the relevant time scale but the natural gas in the current scenario releases more than a million tonnes of fossil carbon dioxide combustion of methane emits approx 2 3 kg co2 per m3 this is a crucial difference in the comparison of the two production systems in favour of bioref concerning labour inputs much labour is required in both scenarios approx 110 million man hours versus 20 mill man hours but much more in the bioref scenario table 4 this large difference is due to differences in the use of indirect labour since the labour requirement in each of the countries direct labour is not that different 2 0 mill versus 2 1 mill man hours this means that in denmark bioref it is possible to produce 160 000 t of crude protein feed and 460 mill m3 upgraded gas with the same degree of direct employment as for soy from brazil coupled with natural gas from denmark current if actual man hours worked per unit of physical output is taken as a measure of labour efficiency the danish and the brazilian danish systems are practically equally efficient when it comes to labour measured in emergy however bioref is less resource efficient i e more resources are required to obtain the same physical output 2 5e 20 sej versus 0 3e 20 sej additionally much more indirect labour is required in the bioref scenario 15e 20 sej versus 2 5e 20 sej one explanation for this could be that the high tech machinery and infrastructure necessary for the suggested biorefinery production requires a lot of work outside the system boundary it appears that the productivity of 2 0 million man hours of direct labour in denmark is dependent on 110 million man hours elsewhere in the global economy this labour input contributes to global employment but is at the same time associated with its own use of resources the ratio of indirect labour to direct labour is 55 in the bioref scenario and only 9 in the current scenario altogether our study supports the conclusion reached by former lca studies that feed production involving local crops may contribute less to some environmental impacts when compared to imported soybean based feed in france mosnier et al 2011 and uk stephen 2012 however as also emphasised by the review study mcauliffe et al 2016 comparisons of results from different production systems should be considered with caution due to many different assumptions 3 4 sensitivity analyses we have changed some of the calculation parameters of the bioref scenario to evaluate the importance for the conclusion of the comparison highlights are inserted as tables 5 and 6 full results are in supplementary material first we considered the importance of the crop yield since it appears within reach to obtain higher yields of grass clover due to improvements in crop varieties or farming practices table 5 increasing the yield from 11 160 kg ha year to 12 160 kg ha year resulted in 6 8 improvements in direct energy use area demand and ghg emission while all other indicators changed less than 5 second we looked at the refining and increased the protein content of harvested clover grass mixture from 20 to 22 of dry matter content as well as the efficiency of separating the protein from the juice into the protein concentrate from 90 to 98 this led to 16 17 improvements in most indicators third we considered that the increase in protein content from 20 to 22 could be obtained through earlier harvest of the grass clover mixture and thus allowing for an additional harvest per season 5 cuts therefore the aforementioned changes in protein content and separation efficiency were accompanied by an extra harvest we coupled an additional harvest with a lower total crop yield since growth is expected to be reduced due to earlier harvest the result showed that the additional work of a fifth harvest and the lower yield does not out balance the benefits from increased protein content and separation efficiency altogether these adjustments caused changes in the bioref scenario assessment results that are relatively small compared to the difference between the two scenarios so the conclusions of the comparison is considered to be robust with respect to the robustness of the results of the current scenario we altered the methodology for distributing the environmental burden between the co products from soy production table 6 there is no correct way to allocate the environmental burden between outputs from co production systems kamp and østergård 2013 as default we have allocated 63 of the environmental impacts to soy meal based on energy content because we focus on energy significant changes in the assessment results occurred when changing to mass based allocation 81 to soy meal price allocation 36 to soy meal and allocation according to emergy algebra 100 to soy meal changes were biggest for electricity labour and diesel use because most of these inputs are used prior to the mill where oil and meal take separate paths the renewability fraction was also affected significantly because soy production is much more dependent on renewable inputs than natural gas this means that even if soy meal requires a minor part of the total resource use in the current scenario even smaller changes will influence the total renewability fraction in spite of the difference in results when changing the allocation method it is of less importance for the conclusion of the comparison between the two scenarios 4 conclusions and perspectives this case study aimed at investigating three aspects of the environmental and socio economic labour impacts of provision of pig feed and gas for the gas grid in denmark by comparing the current situation to a hypothetical biorefinery concept the bioref production system in this case study reduces the use of resources reduces the dependence on non renewable resources and significantly decreases ghg emissions from fossil fuel use without any external heat input however it also has higher diesel and electricity use increased land demand and depends much more on labour embodied in goods indirect labour the conclusion thus depends on stakeholder preferences but the results indicate that there are significant environmental benefits in discontinuing soy meal import and natural gas use if the biorefinery production can be implemented along the suggested lines 4 1 hot spot analysis of the biorefinery concept the first objective of the study is to investigate the environmental hot spots of a suggested danish biorefinery production concept providing pig feed biogas and fertiliser from locally grown grass clover mixtures the results of the assessment of the bioref scenario indicates that the hot spots for resource use are to be found in the crop production grass clover production is critically dependent on use of diesel and large requirements for labour embodied in machinery indirect labour diesel consumption may in the future be reduced by using renewable energy to power agricultural machinery e g biogas tractors or automated robot machinery with much higher fuel efficiency this does not ensure however a reduction in the required indirect labour and may therefore not be less costly automated machinery may be a game changer for the bioref scenario technology since harvesting can be carried out more or less continuously this allows for optimising the timing of harvest to reach the highest protein content in the grass clover mixture the suggested local production of protein feed from grass clover mixture requires a significant agricultural area for the primary production in this study the area needed for 20 substitution of danish protein import equals 180 000 ha i e 7 of denmark s farmland there is no available land so the extension of grass clover cultivation must substitute current land use however this is a likely consequence of the regulatory efforts in the european union under the eu water framework directive eu in order to reduce nutrient leaching and avoid unproductive fallow land one way of keeping biomass production while reducing nutrient leaching would be to substitute current traditional annual cropping systems with perennial cropping systems based on grasses and grass clover mixtures introduction of such a production of perennial green crops could have significant positive environmental effects locally compared to the present agricultural production which is dominated by grain and other annuals and monoculture methods these benefits include a carbon building and less nutrient leaching agriculture there is clear evidence that changing from winter wheat or maize to either grass clover or fertilised ryegrass results in decreased n leaching and decreased greenhouse gas emissions when the difference in soil carbon storage is taken into account larsen et al 2017 manevski et al 2018 the consequences for soil carbon increases and reduced n leaching have not been dealt with in this assessment a full study is required for an analysis of these topics the report by hermansen et al 2017 concludes that it is realistic to consider a grass or grass clover production area for biorefinery purposes of 400 000 ha yr in denmark and that this would have large environmental benefits however even with only 20 import substitution about 100 biorefinery facilities must be established and 180 000 ha converted which is a massive undertaking the optimal logistics and implementation scenarios of this kind of biorefineries are still debated and most likely it will not be a one solution fits all but has to be adapted for specific local conditions of biomass availability and product utilisation an alternative implementation scenario from the one investigated in this study could be to divide the processing steps of juice pressing and protein separation from the juice in this case a large number of farmers most likely dairy farmers install simple equipment for pressing and the extracted juice is transported to a few centralised protein feed production facilities similar to the setup in milk production this would reduce transport of the fibre fraction which is at least 40 of the total weight and 70 of the dry matter a strategy with pressing facilities in farm scale would be an even further step towards localisation in such a production system the pulp would be available on farm perhaps for smaller scale biogas production but more probably for livestock feed how this would change the overall comparison is the objective of further research the production system in this study focuses on two products protein feed and biogas however the concept of biorefining implies that there are possibilities for many other product combinations the fibre fraction has been shown to be a suitable feed for ruminants specifically for dairy cows substituting whole crop grass clover silage or maize silage furthermore the residual juice could be concentrated and used for media and substrate in the biotech industry thus adding to the revenue of the biorefinery and influencing other markets than those analysed herein such new product scenarios would change the assessment and should be part of future work as the biorefining technology is developed 4 2 comparison of the two scenarios the second objective of the study is to compare the environmental profile of this biorefinery concept to the current situation with imported soy meal from brazil and danish natural gas it has been debated whether local production and consumption lead to higher energy resource use efficiency pelletier et al 2011 in our case study the local choice the bioref scenario may be evaluated as the most sustainable with lower resource use lower dependence on non renewable resources significantly lower ghg emissions from fossil fuel use and no requirement of external heat input however it also implies higher diesel and electricity use higher land use and much higher indirect labour requirements the sensitivity analysis altering different production parameters and allocation assumptions concludes that the obtained results are robust how to decide which production system would be the best to use as strategy for development depends on the stakeholder therefore one number combining the different indicators is not provided it must be expected that feed price will be the central decision parameter for danish pig farmers if the socio economic benefits indicated in this study should be realised with the support of farmers a price incentive may be needed at least to get the industry started the high diesel usage in management of grass clover compared to soy should not be an argument preventing to get the other environmental benefits of local production resulting in reduced use of fossil fuels as mentioned diesel consumption may in general be reduced by different mechanisms like automated robot machinery in agriculture with much higher fuel efficiency as well as use of biogas in tractors such changes may happen sooner in denmark than in brazil a larger perspective comes from speculating over the possible future political regulatory and societal development we might expect increases in the cost of transport fuels regulation of the shipping industry to reduce atmospheric pollution phasing out of fossil fuels in general and popular movements in support of less harmful production methods and home grown products even if localisation involves less global specialisation these trends appear to work in favour of a perennial agricultural system and bio based energy system like the one envisioned 4 3 labour requirements a third objective of this study was to investigate the labour inputs required for the two production systems and analyse and interpret the effect of the resource use associated with it the amount of man hours used directly in the bioref scenario is similar to that in the current scenario somewhat surprisingly there is a striking difference in the amount of work done in the background of the studied systems i e the indirect labour put in elsewhere to provide the materials used we estimate that approximately six times as much indirect labour is required in the bioref scenario suggesting that bioref is considerably more labour intensive when both types of labour are included the ratio of indirect labour to direct labour in man hours is 55 in the bioref scenario and only 9 in the current scenario a high ratio probably characterises production systems with high tech sophisticated and automated machinery such production systems require less direct labour to manage and we typically regard them as highly productive ignoring that they are based on the support of much labour in other places an interesting question arises when this line of thinking is extended to the comparison of countries is a high ratio of indirect to direct labour an indicator of living standard and or trade power when assessing the labour inputs by emergy instead of man hours direct labour use differs between the production systems this is because a specific kind of labour in denmark is associated with a higher emergy support per labour input than the same kind of labour in brazil and most of the direct labour inputs in the current scenario occurs in brazil this difference does not apply to the indirect labour which is based on a global average emergy support per man hour when we use emergy to assess the resource use supporting the labour required to provide the studied outputs we find that approximately seven times as many resources are required to support the labour in bioref in some perspectives high labour demand is attractive occupation is a fundamental marker of sense of belonging and well being and most if not all governments consider high employment among their core objectives in contrast companies typically intend to reduce labour inputs e g through mechanisation to reduce direct labour inputs and in the continued search for material inputs that are produced more cost efficiently i e with less indirect labour we do not intend to debate if more or less employment is better however when we associate direct as well as indirect labour inputs with a resource cost it becomes apparent that technologies with fewer labour inputs and all else equal support the objective to reduce resource use the studied comparison indicates that three important mechanisms are at work first material inputs can be reduced but increased labour inputs may outbalance the total resource use supporting the technology secondly direct labour may be reduced but this may result in increased dependence on indirect labour and therefore possibly higher overall resource use finally if production in places with relatively low resource use per capita or man hour is substituted by production in places with high resource use per capita the resource use may increase even if there appears to be gains in terms of labour productivity we find that differences in direct and indirect labour requirements and in the resource base of labour inputs based on location are important factors to consider we hope that future studies comparing the environmental effect

24992,modeling the mechanisms underlying trophic interactions between individuals allows the food web structure to emerge from local interactions which constitutes a prerequisite for assessing how marine ecosystems respond to various anthropogenic pressures using a multispecies spatially explicit individual based model the emergence of trophic patterns was explored in the eastern english channel ecosystem where pelagic benthic trophic coupling was recently studied empirically the osmose model was applied to this ecosystem by explicitly representing the life cycle of 13 fish species and one squid group forced by pelagic and benthic prey fields that are variable over time and space a matrix defining possible accessibilities between life stages was added to the model to link benthic and pelagic communities through overlap of vertical distribution after optimizing some parameters of the model to represent the average state of the fish community during the 2000 2009 period the simulated trophic structure was explored and compared to empirical data the simulated and stable isotope derived trophic levels of fish were in relatively good agreement intraspecific variability of the trophic level is high in the five stable isotope datasets but is well encompassed by the model despite the hypothesis of opportunistic size based predation the simulation showed a decreasing trend of trophic level with size for four benthic species a pattern observed empirically for a different set of species in the ecosystem model exploration showed that this emerging pattern varies spatially and is both explained by the spatial variability of prey availability and by the independence of trophic and size structures of benthic invertebrates the combination of individual based models stomach contents and intrinsic tracers such as stable isotopes appears to be a promising tool to better understand the causes of observed trophic patterns keywords emergent patterns pelagic benthic coupling individual based model food web fish community 1 introduction trophic ecology has been investigated empirically for decades in marine ecosystems to better understand key properties of ecosystems including energy flows in ecosystems the resilience and adaptation of ecosystems to large scale pressures and the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning belgrano et al 2005 the current need to establish an integrated management framework fosters the development of a multitrophic approach where all interspecific interactions are addressed seibold et al 2018 initially addressed through stomach content analysis trophic ecology is now based on various tools including intrinsic tracers such as stable isotope ratios and fatty acids ramos and gonzález solís 2012 combining old and modern techniques is now viewed as the most powerful approach cresson et al 2014 providing both a detailed vision of prey actually consumed and a general picture of trophic fluxes and food web topology in parallel with these field studies based on biological sampling and chemical analysis theoretical work has focused either on predator prey interactions e g lotka volterra or on network complexity and stability belgrano et al 2005 the development of holistic models allowed the coupling of theoretical and empirical approaches by conceptualizing the food web structure of a particular ecosystem based on data and simulating its dynamics typically ecopath models christensen and pauly 1992 aim at balancing the food web structure of an ecosystem of interest based on observed diets and produce network indicators such as the recycling index average path length and total system throughput heymans et al 2014 but also information about species trophic positions and functions and their impacts on other functional groups partly to increase their realism and partly to answer a wider range of scientific questions the complexity of ecosystem models has been increasing by integrating temporal e g ecopath with ecosim and spatial heterogeneity e g ecospace pauly et al 2000 atlantis fulton et al 2011 and by considering age or size structure within a trophic node defined to represent a species or functional group such models are currently mostly used to explore ecosystem responses to anthropogenic or environmental pressure and their potential for theoretical trophic ecology is most likely underused trophic information from field studies is required to parameterize links between compartments at least to identify them and sometimes to set their intensity i e percentage of a prey in the diet of the predator pethybridge et al 2018 however this information is at best used at the species level and is often averaged over several species to inform functional group trophic habits trophic variability exists among individuals and can be linked to ontogenetic changes individual variability and composition of the local trophic environment spatiotemporal heterogeneity e g stehlik and meise 2000 instead of reducing this variability to parameterize ecosystem models in this study we aim to use a complex modeling approach to explore the individual trophic variability of marine fish to do so we used the multispecies individual based model osmose shin and cury 2004 2001 travers et al 2009 where fish individuals constitute the structural unit of the model individual based models ibms allow for representing individuals that adapt to their local environment leading to variability among individuals and that interact mechanistically with each other and with their environment both abiotic and biotic i e composed of other individuals interactions between these adaptive individuals lead to the emergence of population level properties e g resilience spatiotemporal variations of abundance which are more than the sum of individual properties grimm and railsback 2013 applied to trophic ecology this means that the trophic structure of an ecosystem emerges from local predation interactions between fish individuals being both prey and predator we applied the osmose modeling framework to the eastern english channel eec where several empirical trophic studies have been recently conducted the english channel is an epicontinental sea located between the united kingdom and france and is subject to environmental forcing mega tidal regime and strong influence of rivers and various human pressures such as fisheries aggregate extraction maritime traffic and wind farms carpentier et al 2009 the structure and spatiotemporal variation of the fish community has been studied vaz et al 2007 and the trophic links structuring this ecosystem have been recently investigated as well cachera 2013 studied the trophic organization of the fish communities through digestive tract contents and geomorphometric measurements to link it to morphological and functional trait variation across and within species kopp et al 2015 investigated the strength of the pelagic benthic coupling along an inshore offshore gradient via stable isotope ratios giraldo et al 2017 coupled both approaches to make conclusions regarding the resource use of fish along the depth gradient these studies showed that bentho pelagic coupling is strong in the eec with benthic sources being important for both benthic and pelagic fish and with a decreasing intensity of the bentho pelagic coupling as depth increases in addition to these empirical studies a holistic model has been applied to the eec to explore the effects of fisheries management options on the flatfish and demersal fish species girardin 2015 the calibration process of this atlantis model allowed us to gain better insight into ecosystem functioning and to identify the main drivers of the system including the importance of nutrient input through rivers and the competition interactions between demersal species girardin et al 2018 while the eec trophic structure has been investigated through several methods some of its variability remains unexplained and is assumed to be related to intraspecies and seasonal variations to address the finer dynamics of the predation process and how it can shape observed patterns at different levels of organization osmose was applied to the eec ecosystem to explore the trophic variability of fish individuals 2 materials and methods the individual based osmose object oriented simulator of marine ecosystems exploitation shin and cury 2004 2001 travers et al 2009 www osmose model org is a spatial model representing the whole life cycle of several fish species from eggs and larvae up to juveniles and adults this multispecies model is size structured and based on opportunistic predation that depends only on spatiotemporal cooccurrence and body size ratios between a predator and its prey because of this opportunism neither the a priori food web structure nor the diet matrix are set but they emerge from local trophic interactions this model has been applied to a variety of ecosystems such as upwellings e g marzloff et al 2009 travers trolet et al 2014 oliveros ramos et al 2017 estuaries e g brochier et al 2013 semi enclosed seas fu et al

et al 1995 i e of the same size same trophic level tl same location and belonging to the same species during each two week time step the abundance also called worth and biomass of each super individual changes according to the different modeled processes described below fig 1 only the main features and equations are recalled in this paragraph and more complete details can be found in shin and cury 2004 2001 travers et al 2009 and travers trolet et al 2014 at the beginning of the time step super individuals are distributed over a 2 dimensional grid the spatial distribution of fish is driven at the larger scale by presence absence maps provided as input for each species and possibly for different ages and or seasons according to available knowledge when the input distribution map remains the same between two consecutive time steps super individuals can move to adjacent cells following a random walk pattern foraging while always remaining within the limits of their presence map after movement all processes involving local interactions occur explicit predation on other super individuals and on plankton and or benthic invertebrate groups mortality from this explicit predation starvation mortality fishing mortality and mortality from other sources such as top predators in the real world such processes are concurrent and concomitant to approximate real continuous time the mortality algorithm introduces i a subdivision of the time step here set to 10 ii random shuffling of super individuals and mortality processes within every time step and iii asynchronous updating of the state variables i e super individual biomass is updated as the model goes through the processes caron lormier et al 2008 the predation process first assesses the food requirement for each super individual based on the maximum ingestion rate r of the predator i this value is then compared to the amount of suitable food available locally i e in the cell of the predator defined by the suitability of prey size compared to predator size the biomass bj of each prey available and an accessibility coefficient ai j representing vertical overlap and or morphological constraints between the prey j and the predator i depending on the available biomass of prey a predator can thus eat an amount of food varying between 0 no prey of suitable size available and its maximum ingestion rate

relative contribution to the total amount of edible food i e no preference predation mortality is then applied to the preyed super individual by reducing its abundance and biomass according to the realized predation pressure possibly leading the super individual to disappear if abundance falls below 1 according to the amount of food eaten compared to its maximum ingestion the predation

species which constitute 80 of the international landings from this area ices area 7d excluding invertebrates and more than two thirds of the fish biomass sampled during the scientific bottom trawl channel ground fish survey cgfs coppin and travers trolet 1989 this set of species is composed of mackerel scomber scombrus horse mackerel trachurus trachurus sardine sardina pilchardus herring clupea harengus poor cod trisopterus minutus cod gadus morhua whiting merlangius merlangus pouting trisopterus luscus red mullet mullus surmuletus dragonet mostly callionymus lyra lesser spotted dogfish scyliorhinus canicula sole solea solea plaice pleuronectes platessa and squids loligo forbesi and loligo vulgaris species parameters are reported in table 1 and are mostly derived from carpentier et al 2009 but also from other literature or online databases appendix a the modeled area extends from 49 n 2 w to 51 2 n 2 5 e and is composed of 445 cells of 0 6 x 0 6 fig 2 presence absence maps per species and per season and or age class when available have been computed from survey data and available literature appendix b two species migrate out of the english channel towards the north sea adult horse mackerel from july to september and herring from april to september when these species are out of the modeled area they grow following the von bertalanffy curve table 1 and undergo an additional mortality of 1 05 year 1 and 0 55 year 1 respectively values derived from an ecopath model applied to north sea mackinson and daskalov 2007 reproductive seasonality of each species is reported in appendix c while the fishing mortality rate is considered constant over the seasons for all species except for squids fishing closure from may to mid july and horse mackerel increased fishing mortality rate from october to december 2 3 forcing prey fields planktonic and benthic groups during the predation process super individuals can feed both on other explicitly modeled fish and on low trophic level ltl sources ltl groups are integrated in osmose through the forcing of biomass prey fields plankton prey fields come from the eco mars3d biogeochemical model applied to the english channel le goff et al 2017 vanhoutte brunier et al 2008 with a grid of 2 km horizontal resolution and 10 vertical layers the nutrients and plankton dynamics simulated with this model have been validated with data from monitoring stations and correctly reproduce the interannual variability observed in the english channel le goff et al 2017 the biomasses of two phytoplankton groups grossly representing dinoflagellates and diatoms as well as microzooplankton and mesozooplankton groups have been integrated vertically and over the 2 week time step of osmose to be used as forcing prey fields furthermore as the current application aims at simulating the eec ecosystem at a stable state plankton climatology was created by averaging data bimonthly from the 2000 2006 period appendix d six additional ltl groups were added to complement the ltl food source available to fish a macrozooplankton group representing both holoplankton and meroplankton mostly composed of benthic invertebrate larvae and five benthic groups of different sizes table 2 as available information on the spatial distribution of these groups was not sufficient they were considered to be homogeneously distributed the grid used in osmose has no vertical dimension therefore accessibility coefficients were used to represent vertical overlap both among super individuals and between super individuals and ltl groups in the computation of prey biomass available for predators according to their ecology each stage of each species and each ltl group was associated with a vertical layer pelagic for plankton buoyant eggs larvae and small pelagic fish benthic for benthic groups and species living on the seabed such as flatfish and demersal for individuals living near the sea bed and having access to both pelagic and benthic prey such as gadoids the accessibility parameters are presented in table 3 2 4 calibration the model was calibrated using the calibrar r package with the ahr es algorithm oliveros ramos and shin 2016 an automatic evolutionary algorithm developed for calibrating stochastic models such as osmose this algorithm explores a range of values for unknown parameters and uses likelihood objective functions to select the optimal values for the catches and biomass to be comprised within ranges of observed values when available landings per species have been extracted from the ices fisheries statistics official database ices 2011a for the ices area 7d corresponding to the eec over the period 2000 2009 total stock biomass estimates are directly available from stock assessment reports for sole and plaice ices 2011b while for whiting cod mackerel and herring total stock biomass estimates were derived from stock assessments covering a wider area ices 2012 2011b and were therefore scaled to the eec proportional to the relative landings in this area in osmose species biomass is computed as the sum over the entire area of the biomass of all super individuals older than 6 months averaged annually simulated landings come from the fished individuals eq 3 over the entire area integrated at the annual time scale the calibration was performed in 3 phases following recommendations by oliveros ramos et al 2017 based on model dependency of the parameters and availability of initial estimates first the 10 ltl accessibility coefficients were adjusted for 200 generations then the 14 larval mortality rates were added to the set of parameters to adjust for 200 other generations finally 12 additional mortalities including fishing mortalities were added to the third phase where 300 generations were run with a total of 36 parameters to estimate the first two phases allow optimization of the calibration convergence while the third phase includes all the parameters and lasts longer to ensure that an optimal solution is reached 2 5 scenarios and exploration of simulated trophic patterns once the model is calibrated it is run for 120 years with the first 100 years corresponding to the spin up time during which the system stabilizes and is no longer driven by the model initialization the results presented thereafter corresponding to the average state of the eec ecosystem in the period 2000 2009 are computed from averaging the last 20 simulated years to smooth any interannual variability furthermore osmose is a stochastic model and 50 replicates were run using the same input parameters following the pattern oriented modeling approach pom grimm et al 2005 the model s ability to reproduce independent patterns is explored by comparing simulated output with data neither used during the parameterization nor during the calibration as the osmose model is based on opportunistic predation validation patterns could include emerging features linked to the predation process such as realized diets and associated tls or food web structures here we used independent data of tls calculated from nitrogen stable isotope ratios si measured on the same species in the same ecosystem cresson et al 2017 2018 jennings and van der molen 2015 kopp et al 2015 mialet et al 2017 tl calculations are based on the premise that the nitrogen isotopic ratio δ 15n hereafter is gradually enriched at each tl a phenomenon called trophic enrichment tl is thus considered as the isotopic difference between the species of interest and a trophic baseline i e a proxy of the ultimate organic matter source at the base of the food web divided by the trophic enrichment factor tef the queen scallop aequipecten opercularis was used as a trophic baseline due to the trophic importance of benthic production and because the use of a primary consumer i e at tl 2 allows smoothing of the small scale isotopic fluctuations of primary production that are not integrated in fish isotopic ratios two methods are used where tef is either considered the same at all levels of the food web e g in kopp et al 2015 cresson 2017 2018 mialet et al 2017 or decreases with increasing δ 15n of the diet jennings and van der molen 2015 details about the method can be found in dedicated literature hussey et al 2014 but sensitivity analyses demonstrated that for intermediate tl species such as the ones considered in the present study calculated tls are rather similar regardless of the method jennings and van der molen 2015 p cresson unpubl results in osmose each super individual has a proper tl which depends on its feeding history the tl computation of a super individual i is based on the classical formula in which the tl of a predator equals 1 plus the average tl of the prey weighted by their relative ingested biomass eq 6 6 t l i t 1 j t l j t d c j i t where tli t is the trophic level of i at time t and dcj i t is the proportion of prey j in the diet of predator i at time t while the tl of explicitly modeled individuals is dynamic the tl of the ltl groups is fixed and has been set to 1 for phytoplankton and derived from tl estimates based on stable isotope studies in the same area kopp et al 2015 for the other groups table 2 the tl of very small benthos is set to 3 to represent the omnivory of this group partly composed of meiofauna the tl of newly spawned eggs within osmose is arbitrarily set to 3 to be close to the tl of the first feeding larvae finally we assume that an individual that has not fed keeps its previous tl after comparison of simulated tls with data model exploration is performed by analyzing the variation of diet composition and tl with size for all species diet composition is computed using the following predefined size classes for predators 0 5 5 10 10 15 15 20 20 25 25 30 30 40 40 50 50 60 60 70 70 90 90 110 and 110 130 from all super individuals pertaining to a size class the biomasses of the different prey eaten including other super individuals and ltl groups are grouped by species over the entire area to explore the relationship between tl and size super individuals are grouped by centimeters and the tl distribution within each size group is computed min first quartile median third quartile max the tl size relationship is then explored spatially by fitting a linear model in each cell with more than 10 super individuals the resulting slope values are then mapped for each species with indication of the quality of the fit using r² values 3 results the evolutionary algorithm used for calibrating the model converged to an acceptable configuration where all median values of simulated biomass distribution are within the range of observed values fig 3 median values of simulated catches are within the range of observations for half of the species lesser spotted dogfish whiting cod mackerel sardine and squids while for red mullet horse mackerel and herring catches are underestimated as only 42 42 and 18 of the 50 simulated replicates are within the range of the observations respectively simulated catches of pouting sole and plaice are smaller than the observations median values corresponding to 73 57 and 80 of the minimal observed values respectively even if the biomass of the flatfish species corresponds to the total stock biomass estimates through the stock assessment ices 2011a for the other assessed species whiting cod mackerel and herring simulated biomass also displays a good fit to biomass estimated over the period of 2000 2009 the optimized values of accessibility parameters show high variability across the ltl groups from approximately 10 4 for dinoflagellates to approximately 0 4 for meso zooplankton and very large benthos table 2 two important prey groups for the fish community a comparison of simulation outputs with published tls from empirical si analysis is performed as a validation process fig 4 displays the trophic spectra of the modeled species i e for each species the distribution of the individual tl weighted by the individual biomass in the simulations the width of the trophic spectrum i e the difference between the maximal and minimal individual tls varies according to species from 1 6 levels for red mullet up to 3 9 levels for herring more importantly the way biomass is distributed along tls also varies for some species biomass distribution is concentrated around a particular tl e g approximately 3 9 for red mullet pouting poor cod dragonet sole while for other species biomass is spread over a wide range of tls e g whiting cod sardine squids the biomass concentration of approximately 3 9 for benthic fish species is linked to the dominant proportion of very small benthos and small benthos tl 3 and tl 2 9 respectively table 2 in the diet of these species fig 5 plaice individuals of intermediate length 15 50 cm also largely rely on these prey groups explaining the concentration of biomass around tl 3 8 in the trophic spectrum fig 4 the biomass around tl 4 5 is explained by the presence of very large benthos tl 3 6 in the diet of larger plaice individuals the wide trophic spectra of lesser spotted dogfish whiting and cod are explained by the diversity of prey composing their diets fig 5 simulated trophic spectra were in good agreement with the range of tls estimated from stable isotope measurements for most species for red mullet poor cod and plaice simulated tls were similar to si derived tls which were moreover coherent between empirical studies for lesser spotted dogfish pouting whiting sole horse mackerel and mackerel empirical data display high variability across studies but this variability is generally well encompassed by the model however empirical tl estimates show that the maximal tl observed for sole can be higher than that simulated while mackerel can have a minimal si derived tl smaller than that simulated it is worth noting that for mackerel the model simulates two tl modes approximately 3 6 and 4 3 corresponding respectively to young individuals feeding only on mesozooplankton tl 2 6 table 2 and larger individuals feeding on small squids and small fish mostly young sardine and horse mackerel fig 5 similarly empirical estimates of mackerel tl show low values of approximately 3 5 in cresson et al 2017 and jennings and van der molen 2015 with fish being between 16 9 and 41 cm long table 4 while tl values are higher than 4 in the three other studies but for similar fish lengths 18 to 34 cm table 4 if we assume that tl estimated from stable isotopes are representative of the trophic position of the bulk of a species then the eec osmose model tends to slightly overestimate the tl of cod dragonet and squids and to underestimate the tl for herring the si derived tl of sardine corresponds to the bulk of the simulated biomass but the model also simulates sardine individuals at a tl between 2 and 3 feeding on diatoms and mesozooplankton fig 5 to further explore the drivers of individual variability among species tl distribution the evolution of the mean tl with size is presented in fig 6 while mean tl generally increases with size for most species this is not the case for red mullet poor cod dragonet and sole and for pouting and plaice to a lesser extent respectively from 10 to 35 cm and from 20 to 50 cm for which the mean tl decreases with size these species are characterized by a benthic diet with the proportion of very small benthos tl 3 decreasing with size and the proportion of medium benthos tl 2 2 increasing as fish grow larger which explains the decreasing tl with size for these species the evolution of mean tl with size is not linear and most species display a strong change of tl at smaller size while mean tl varies less with size for larger individuals tipping points can be identified and linked to ontogenetic changes in the diets of species for instance sardine and herring fish longer than 20 cm no longer feed on diatoms fig 5 explaining the abrupt tl increase at this size other ecological features can be observed such as the marked shift from a plankton feeding larval stage roughly for fish smaller than 5 to 10 cm on fig 6 to a benthic feeding juvenile stage for all benthic and demersal species finally other tl breakpoints linked to diet shifts exist for larger fish the occurrence of very large benthos for lesser spotted dogfish larger than 30 cm pouting larger than 35 cm whiting larger than 15 cm cod larger than 20 cm and plaice larger than 50 cm and the disappearance of mesozooplankton for horse mackerel and mackerel larger than 20 cm to supplement the patterns observed over the entire area between tl and size the spatial distribution of the tl size relationship is mapped fig 7 the negative relationship between tl and size is confirmed in every grid cell for red mullet dragonet and sole this pattern appears robust r² 0 3 in the dover strait northeast in the north of the central english channel northwest and in the bay of seine south for poor cod another species showing a decreasing tl size relationship at the global scale the spatial distribution of the slope is less informative r² 0 3 but shows both positive and negative relationships the latter occurring also in the dover strait and north of the central english channel for plaice and pouting the relationship is positive in most cell grids and is probably driven by the strong difference of tl between fish of intermediate size and larger fish robust positive relationships between tl and size also occur for pouting herring sardine and squids 4 discussion 4 1 ability of the model to capture eec ecosystem dynamics in this study we were able to adapt the 2d osmose model using a vertical overlap matrix and apply it to the eec shallow ecosystem characterized by strong bentho pelagic coupling after parameterizing the model the semiautomatic calibration method produced an overall good fit of the model to the 2000 2009 average state of the eec ecosystem with biomass of all species and catch values of half of the species being within the range of the observed values the discrepancies observed for some species between modeled and observed catches and biomasses can be explained by several factors first a constant fishing mortality is applied in osmose to individuals older than the age at recruitment i e similar to broken stick selectivity with age while in reality due to the different fleet selectivity and variable catchability at age the fishing pressure endured by fish varies with age length quinn and deriso 1999 nonetheless it is worth noting that the total mortality varies with age within osmose notably due to explicit predation mortality which tends to decrease with size second the biomass target values come from single stock assessments i e correspond to model outputs with specific hypotheses and thus should be taken as estimates with associated uncertainty rather than exact values brooks and deroba 2015 similarly target catch values come from declared landings completed by estimates of discards when available even if the eec is considered a data rich ecosystem some uncertainties persist when estimating discards and total catches enever et al 2007 pauly and zeller 2016 furthermore the hypothesis made to allocate the biomass of widely distributed stock to the ices 7 d area based on the landings ratio does not take into account the spatial variability of fishing effort and assumes a homogeneous distribution of fish again contributing to the uncertainty around biomass target values third the calibration process was limited to the optimization of 36 unknown parameters therefore constraining the space of simulated output reachable during the calibration despite these limits the model was able to reproduce species biomasses and most species catches but also other features independent of the data used for parameterization and calibration for most species the simulated tls are in good accordance with tl estimates derived from si data both in terms of average values and variability within species however eec osmose underestimates sardine and herring mean tls compared to si estimates the exploration of simulated tl and diet composition versus size shows that the smaller size classes have a diet mostly composed of diatoms and mesozooplankton resulting in small tl values while the larger individuals rely on mesozooplankton explaining their higher tl one hypothesis for the difference observed between the data and the model is that empirical data underestimate the importance of phytoplankton food source this could be explained by the absence of very small individuals smaller than 5 cm for herring smaller than 7 7 cm for sardine table 4 in the sample and or by the sampling season autumn corresponding to higher zooplankton food available compared to phytoplankton another hypothesis is the biased simulation of diet shift from phytoplankton to zooplankton prey at larger size than observed for herring and sardine both species are known to consume these two types of prey with seasonally variable intensity costalago et al 2012 but the ontogenetic shift in their diet has been reported at an earlier larval stage e g denis et al 2016 these results suggest that the minimum and maximum predation size ratios set for herring and sardine may be revised possibly by setting different ratios according to individual ontogenetic development e g travers trolet et al 2014 moreover due to the model structure and lack of suitable stable isotope data the mesozooplankton group has a fixed tl that prevents simulation of the spatiotemporal variability of the tl of the zooplankton community available to fish it should nevertheless be remembered that fish stable isotope ratios and the derived tl values can be seen as emergent properties resulting from their diet but also from a large set of environmental or physiological parameters e g boecklen et al 2011 among these large spatial and temporal variations of phytoplankton isotopic ratios magozzi et al 2017 at the basis of the food web and or fish migrations between zones where primary production exhibits different isotopic ratios may drive changes in fish isotopic ratios that are hard to capture and that may blur tl calculation the overestimation of the trophic position of cod in the model comes with an overestimation of the proportion of fish in the diet the model simulates the proportion of fish biomass in cod diets as between 50 and 80 according to size classes while fish represent nearly one quarter or less of the prey found in stomach content analysis crustaceans being the main prey for juveniles and adults cachera 2013 pinnegar 2014 mialet et al 2017 this bias is due to the relatively simple accessibility matrix set for representing the proportion of prey biomass available to a predator according to their vertical distributions for this matrix cod is considered to be demersal i e to have full access to other demersal individuals and to have access to half of the pelagic biomass and half of the benthos biomass to better represent the feeding behavior of cod accessibility coefficients should be revised for instance by increasing accessibility to benthic prey and reducing accessibility to pelagic and demersal individuals for this study the accessibility matrix was introduced to mimic vertical overlap between predators and prey as required to model both benthic and pelagic communities with an opportunistic size based predation but its parameterization was kept as simple as possible for their coupled size spectrum model blanchard et al 2009 considered that all predators spent half of their time feeding on benthic invertebrates and the other half feeding on pelagic organisms future developments on how to better set these accessibility parameters could involve consideration of the spatial variability of trophic interactions e g depth driven variability in bentho pelagic coupling giraldo et al 2017 or use morphological attributes trait based approach of the different species e g orientation of the mouth 4 2 relationship between size and tl when considering tl with regard to size for the different species modeled two main patterns emerge from the simulations the most frequent pattern is an increase of tl as size increases which is often more pronounced for the smaller size classes this positive relationship can display some breakpoints linked to diet composition shifts as illustrated by planktivorous fish species at 20 cm the second pattern is observed for only four benthic species red mullet poor cod dragonet and sole and corresponds to a decrease of tl with increasing size for the small individuals of these four benthic species smaller than 5 10 cm the initial increase in tl is explained by the pelagic and planktivorous mode of the larvae before settlement on the sea bottom modeled through change of the accessibility predation coefficient table 3 in aquatic ecology the assumption that larger individuals have a higher tl is often admitted as predation is constrained by body size through gape limitation such a relationship has been explored and confirmed across species in various ecosystems by confronting the mean or maximum size of species with their mean δ 15n e g france et al 1998 romanuk et al 2011 however other studies have reported an absence of correlation between species mean length and their trophic position e g layman et al 2005 jennings et al 2001 also documented a weak cross species relationship between the maximum size of fish species and their mean δ 15n value but a strong relationship at the community level i e using the individual length of fish and pooling the data together within size classes the ontogenetic increase of tl with increasing size has also been confirmed for benthic fish species by badalamenti et al 2002 investigating the north sea trophic structure jennings et al 2002a found a significant positive relationship between fish length and δ 15n for 16 species over 31 more interestingly this relationship was found to be negative for herring and plaice whose tl decreases as their length increases in addition the pattern observed may be positive in one environment but negative in another jennings and van der molen 2015 the results obtained in the present study thus demonstrate that the variability may appear at even a lower spatial scale confirming the call for a better understanding of the effect of environmental gradients on trophic functioning ings et al 2009 based on stable isotope data in the eec kopp et al 2011 confirmed this decreasing trend of tl with size for plaice but also for skates and even for whiting in some particular habitats located in the central bay of seine and part of the dover strait in half of the region species combinations they studied jennings and van der molen 2015 observed no relationship between mass and tl and the positive relationships mostly occurred for piscivore species as they have to capture mobile prey gape size is a key factor driving feeding abilities in these species in benthic systems feeding mechanisms could be more based on opportunistic predation of carrion and living organisms in this context prey size may not be as important in driving the feeding mechanism as for pelagic systems while based on opportunistic size based predation osmose was unexpectedly able to reproduce decreasing trends of tl with size for some benthic species in eec osmose the benthic species demonstrating a clear declining tl trend with size are not the same as the benthic species found to display this pattern empirically however it is worth noting that the empirical negative relationship found for plaice between 9 and 48 cm jennings et al 2002a is partly present in the model if we focus on intermediate sized individuals i e before the introduction of very large benthos in the diet at about 50 cm being able to reproduce the negative tl size relationship using such a model allows for drawing two nonexclusive hypotheses of its origin first the spatial distribution of fish individuals changes with age appendix b which may result in different prey compositions being available locally including the case where only prey with lower tls are available in the area inhabited by larger fish individuals the spatial distribution of the tl size relationship confirms this spatial heterogeneity for some species thus the absence of squid eggs in the dover strait and the north central channel is linked to the strong tl size negative relationship observed in these areas where the benthic fish diet is only composed of benthic invertebrates for mackerel the absence of juveniles in the bay of seine explains the spatial heterogeneity of the signal and suggests that a negative tl size relationship could be observed empirically if focus was placed on the adults of this region in the current model spatially homogeneous benthic prey fields were used because insufficient knowledge of benthos dynamics was available at this scale the simulated trophic spatial variability would probably be higher if a more realistic benthic community was included in the model the second hypothesis underlying the simulated pattern is that conversely to what is largely admitted for the pelagic prey the trophic structure of the benthic prey is not linked to the size structure of the benthic invertebrate community in the diet of the simulated benthic fish the increasing proportion of medium benthos with a small tl compared to the proportion of small benthos with a higher tl leads mathematically to a tl decreasing with size at the predator level this pattern is linked to the predation hypothesis underlying the model and reflects the actual opportunistic pattern of the benthic fish species that consume the most available resources van denderen et al 2018 the selection of species used to set the tl of the benthic groups could have an impact on the overall tl size relationships of fish however they were selected because of their abundance in the area therefore they were considered suitable to represent the main prey available for fish only a few studies have investigated the relationship between size and trophic position for marine benthic invertebrates jennings et al 2002b demonstrated that for benthic invertebrates the relationship between size and tl reflected intraspecific patterns i e individual growth and not interspecific patterns i e no evidence for a relationship between maximum body size and tl across species similarly dinmore and jennings 2004 observed a negative relationship between tl and body mass demonstrating that body dimension may not be a major driver of predation in benthic systems in their coupled size based model blanchard et al 2009 confirmed that benthic invertebrates share a common size unstructured resource and therefore are not strongly trophically size structured in other words two benthic invertebrates of different sizes can exhibit the same tl as their diet would be the same an ontogenetic diet change in the predator could thus result in an inconclusive or decreasing length tl pattern 4 3 variability of tl across sources the current study benefited from the existence of several stable isotope analyses performed in the eec here we used the available tl estimates at the individual level and explored the intraspecies variability of si derived tls which increased both with the number of fish individuals sampled and with the width of body sizes sampled table 4 the high variability of tls within a species was confirmed by the model where individuals can have different tls depending on their size involving different size ranges of available prey their spatial location local encounters with different prey and the feeding history of their prey leading to different tls of the prey while the intraspecific tl variability from stable isotopes was required to validate the emergent patterns of the model the comparison of tl values between different si studies was also informative indeed the agreement observed between the five studies e g plaice increases the reliability of these estimates both in terms of value and width of distribution for sardine the very similar tl distribution observed between two studies counterbalances the low number of individuals sampled 10 in each study and therefore improves the reliability of these data while the five empirical studies provided similar estimates of species mean tls and variability for some species they can lead to different estimates of the tl for other species e g the lesser spotted dogfish mean tl goes from 3 5 to 4 8 the whiting mean tl ranges from 4 to 5 1 discrepancies between the empirical studies and with the model can be due to differences in sampling dates and therefore temporal variation of diet and integration dynamics seasonal and or interannual e g schafer et al 2002 the spatial location of sampling and its effect on diet kopp et al 2015 giraldo et al 2017 the variability of the trophic baseline used magozzi et al 2017 or hypothesis regarding tef hussey et al 2014 these intraspecific variations are nonetheless classically observed e g jennings and van der molen 2015 isotopic data allowed validation of the model but other trophic data sources could have been used to provide a complementary vision comparison with stomach content data allowed for a better understanding of the discrepancies regarding the cod tl the tl overestimation is linked to the overestimation of fish in the cod diet composition both isotopic and stomach content data sources are now considered complementary e g cresson et al 2014 giraldo et al 2017 the latter one informing a snapshot diet with identified prey while the former integrates trophic fluxes over months and allows us to quantify the fluxes between predators and a pool of prey of similar isotopic signatures the ecosystem model can now be added to the list of available tools to explore trophic function and individual variability of tls and could be used in a similar way to explore individual variability across seasons and or space i e at different depths 5 conclusion using a multispecies ibm constrained by size based opportunistic predation we were able to reproduce the average trophic structure of the eec over 2000 2009 including benthic and pelagic communities due to the individual variability in terms of size spatial location and feeding history the model simulations displayed patterns that were observed in empirical studies but were unexpected from a size based predation approach here the ibm framework has been shown to be effective in investigating among individual trophic variability and for understanding the plausible drivers of the negative tl size relationship observed empirically for some species the uncoupling of the trophic structure and size structure of benthic invertebrates appeared to be the key to this pattern but future studies should further explore this potential link and identify morphological aspects to better represent the predation of fish on benthic invertebrates the availability of tl estimates from stable isotopes has been a key to validating the model and encouraging strong collaborations between modelers and field laboratory scientists indeed while trophic data are often used to parameterize or validate ecosystem models pethybridge et al 2018 complex models and particularly ibms appear useful to inform on the trophic functioning of an ecosystem and to explore different hypotheses regarding the causes of observed patterns as the trophic patterns simulated with osmose have been validated for the eec the model will now be available to explore the ecosystem impacts of different scenarios including management measures and climate change the

24992,modeling the mechanisms underlying trophic interactions between individuals allows the food web structure to emerge from local interactions which constitutes a prerequisite for assessing how marine ecosystems respond to various anthropogenic pressures using a multispecies spatially explicit individual based model the emergence of trophic patterns was explored in the eastern english channel ecosystem where pelagic benthic trophic coupling was recently studied empirically the osmose model was applied to this ecosystem by explicitly representing the life cycle of 13 fish species and one squid group forced by pelagic and benthic prey fields that are variable over time and space a matrix defining possible accessibilities between life stages was added to the model to link benthic and pelagic communities through overlap of vertical distribution after optimizing some parameters of the model to represent the average state of the fish community during the 2000 2009 period the simulated trophic structure was explored and compared to empirical data the simulated and stable isotope derived trophic levels of fish were in relatively good agreement intraspecific variability of the trophic level is high in the five stable isotope datasets but is well encompassed by the model despite the hypothesis of opportunistic size based predation the simulation showed a decreasing trend of trophic level with size for four benthic species a pattern observed empirically for a different set of species in the ecosystem model exploration showed that this emerging pattern varies spatially and is both explained by the spatial variability of prey availability and by the independence of trophic and size structures of benthic invertebrates the combination of individual based models stomach contents and intrinsic tracers such as stable isotopes appears to be a promising tool to better understand the causes of observed trophic patterns keywords emergent patterns pelagic

combining old and modern techniques is now viewed as the most powerful approach cresson et al 2014 providing both a detailed vision of prey actually consumed and a general picture of trophic fluxes and food web topology in parallel with these field studies based on biological sampling and chemical analysis theoretical work has focused either on predator prey interactions e g lotka volterra or on network complexity and stability belgrano et al 2005 the development of holistic models allowed the coupling of theoretical and empirical approaches by conceptualizing the food web structure of a particular ecosystem based on data and simulating its dynamics typically ecopath models christensen and pauly 1992 aim at balancing the food web structure of an ecosystem of interest based on observed diets and produce network indicators such as the recycling index average path length and total system throughput heymans et al 2014 but also information about species trophic positions and functions and their impacts on other functional groups partly to increase their realism and partly to answer a wider range of scientific questions the complexity of ecosystem models has been increasing by integrating temporal e g ecopath with ecosim and spatial heterogeneity e g ecospace pauly et al 2000 atlantis fulton et al 2011 and by considering age or size structure within a trophic node defined to represent a species or functional group such models are currently mostly used to explore ecosystem responses to anthropogenic or environmental pressure and their potential for theoretical trophic ecology is most likely underused trophic information from field studies is required to parameterize links between compartments at least to identify them and sometimes to set their intensity i e percentage of a prey in the diet of the predator pethybridge et al 2018 however this information is at best used at the species level and is often averaged over several species to inform functional group trophic habits trophic variability exists among individuals and can be linked to ontogenetic changes individual variability and composition of the local trophic environment spatiotemporal heterogeneity e g stehlik and meise 2000 instead of reducing this variability to parameterize ecosystem models in this study we aim to use a complex modeling approach to explore the individual trophic variability of marine fish to do so we used the multispecies individual based model osmose shin and cury 2004 2001 travers et al 2009 where fish individuals constitute the structural unit of the model individual based models ibms allow for representing individuals that adapt to their local environment leading to variability among individuals and that interact mechanistically with each other and with their environment both abiotic and biotic i e composed of other individuals interactions between these adaptive individuals lead to the emergence of population level properties e g resilience spatiotemporal variations of abundance which are more than the sum of individual properties grimm and railsback 2013 applied to trophic ecology this means that the trophic structure of an ecosystem emerges from local predation interactions between fish individuals being both prey and predator we applied the osmose modeling framework to the eastern english channel eec where several empirical trophic studies have been recently conducted the english channel is an epicontinental sea located between the united kingdom and france and is subject to environmental forcing mega tidal regime and strong influence of rivers and various human pressures such as fisheries aggregate extraction maritime traffic and wind farms carpentier et al 2009 the structure and spatiotemporal variation of the fish community has been studied vaz et al 2007 and the trophic links structuring this ecosystem have been recently investigated as well cachera 2013 studied the trophic organization of the fish communities through digestive tract contents and geomorphometric measurements to link it to morphological and functional trait variation across and within species kopp et al 2015 investigated the strength of the pelagic benthic coupling along an inshore offshore gradient via stable isotope ratios giraldo et al 2017 coupled both approaches to make conclusions regarding the resource use of fish along the depth gradient these studies showed that bentho pelagic coupling is strong in the eec with benthic sources being important for both benthic and pelagic fish and with a decreasing intensity of the bentho pelagic coupling as depth increases in addition to these empirical studies a holistic model has been applied to the eec to explore the effects of fisheries management options on the flatfish and demersal fish species girardin 2015 the calibration process of this atlantis model allowed us to gain better insight into ecosystem functioning and to identify the main drivers of the system including the importance of nutrient input through rivers and the competition interactions between demersal species girardin et al 2018 while the eec trophic structure has been investigated through several methods some of its variability remains unexplained and is assumed to be related to intraspecies and seasonal variations to address the finer dynamics of the predation process and how it can shape observed patterns at different levels of organization osmose was applied to the eec ecosystem to explore the trophic variability of fish individuals 2 materials and methods the individual based osmose object oriented simulator of marine ecosystems exploitation shin and cury 2004 2001 travers et al 2009 www osmose model org is a spatial model representing the whole life cycle of several fish species from eggs and larvae up to juveniles and adults this multispecies model is size structured and based on opportunistic predation that depends only on spatiotemporal cooccurrence and body size ratios between a predator and its prey because of this opportunism neither the a priori food web structure nor the diet matrix are set but they emerge from local trophic interactions this model has been applied to a variety of ecosystems such as upwellings e g marzloff et al 2009 travers trolet et al 2014 oliveros ramos et al 2017 estuaries e g brochier et al 2013 semi enclosed seas fu et al

et al 1995 i e of the same size same trophic level tl same location and belonging to the same species during each two week time step the abundance also called worth and biomass of each super individual changes according to the different modeled processes described below fig 1 only the main features and equations are recalled in this paragraph and more complete details can be found in shin and cury 2004 2001 travers et al 2009 and travers trolet et al 2014 at the beginning of the time step super individuals are distributed over a 2 dimensional grid the spatial distribution of fish is driven at the larger scale by presence absence maps provided as input for each species and possibly for different ages and or seasons according to available knowledge when the input distribution map remains the same between two consecutive time steps super individuals can move to adjacent cells following a random walk pattern foraging while always remaining within the limits of their presence map after movement all processes involving local interactions occur explicit predation on other super individuals and on plankton and or benthic invertebrate groups mortality from this explicit predation starvation mortality fishing mortality and mortality from other sources such as top predators in the real world such processes are concurrent and concomitant to approximate real continuous time the mortality algorithm introduces i a subdivision of the time step here set to 10 ii random shuffling of super individuals and mortality processes within every time step and iii asynchronous updating of the state variables i e super individual biomass is updated as the model goes through the processes caron lormier et al 2008 the predation process first assesses the food requirement for each super individual based on the maximum ingestion rate r of the predator i this value is then compared to the amount of suitable food available locally i e in the cell of the predator defined by the suitability of prey size compared to predator size the biomass bj of each prey available and an accessibility coefficient ai j representing vertical overlap and or morphological constraints between the prey j and the predator i depending on the available biomass of prey a predator can thus eat an amount of food varying between 0 no prey of suitable size available and its maximum ingestion rate

relative contribution to the total amount of edible food i e no preference predation mortality is then applied to the preyed super individual by reducing its abundance and biomass according to the realized predation pressure possibly leading the super individual to disappear if abundance falls below 1 according to the amount of food eaten compared to its maximum ingestion the predation

particularly high mortality term is applied to the first stages eggs to represent the bottleneck of survival due to nonfertilization of eggs starvation of first feeding larvae advection sinking and predation by nonexplicitly modeled organisms because very little quantification exists on these processes the larval mortality rates are calibrated see section 2 4 after this loop of interaction

species which constitute 80 of the international landings from this area ices area 7d excluding invertebrates and more than two thirds of the fish biomass sampled during the scientific bottom trawl channel ground fish survey cgfs coppin and travers trolet 1989 this set of species is composed of mackerel scomber scombrus horse mackerel trachurus trachurus sardine sardina pilchardus herring clupea harengus poor cod trisopterus minutus cod gadus morhua whiting merlangius merlangus pouting trisopterus luscus red mullet mullus surmuletus dragonet mostly callionymus lyra lesser spotted dogfish scyliorhinus canicula sole solea solea plaice pleuronectes platessa and squids loligo forbesi and loligo vulgaris species parameters are reported in table 1 and are mostly derived from carpentier et al 2009 but also from other literature or online databases appendix a the modeled area extends from 49 n 2 w to 51 2 n 2 5 e and is composed of 445 cells of 0 6 x 0 6 fig 2 presence absence maps per species and per season and or age class when available have been computed from survey data and available literature appendix b two species migrate out of the english channel towards the north sea adult horse mackerel from july to september and herring from april to september when these species are out of the modeled area they grow following the von bertalanffy curve table 1 and undergo an additional mortality of 1 05 year 1 and 0 55 year 1 respectively values derived from an ecopath model applied to north sea mackinson and daskalov 2007 reproductive seasonality of each species is reported in appendix c while the fishing mortality rate is considered constant over the seasons for all species except for squids fishing closure from may to mid july and horse mackerel increased fishing mortality rate from october to december 2 3 forcing prey fields planktonic and benthic groups during the predation process super individuals can feed both on other explicitly modeled fish and on low trophic level ltl sources ltl groups are integrated in osmose through the forcing of biomass prey fields plankton prey fields come from the eco mars3d biogeochemical model applied to the english channel le goff et al 2017 vanhoutte brunier et al 2008 with a grid of 2 km horizontal resolution and 10 vertical layers the nutrients and plankton dynamics simulated with this model have been validated with data from monitoring stations and correctly reproduce the interannual variability observed in the english channel le goff et al 2017 the biomasses of two phytoplankton groups grossly representing dinoflagellates and diatoms as well as microzooplankton and mesozooplankton groups have been integrated vertically and over the 2 week time step of osmose to be used as forcing prey fields furthermore as the current application aims at simulating the eec ecosystem at a stable state plankton climatology was created by averaging data bimonthly from the 2000 2006 period appendix d six additional ltl groups were added to complement the ltl food source available to fish a macrozooplankton group representing both holoplankton and meroplankton mostly composed of benthic invertebrate larvae and five benthic groups of different sizes table 2 as available information on the spatial distribution of these groups was not sufficient they were considered to be homogeneously distributed the grid used in osmose has no vertical dimension therefore accessibility coefficients were used to represent vertical overlap both among super individuals and between super individuals and ltl groups in the computation of prey biomass available for predators according to their ecology each stage of each species and each ltl group was associated with a vertical layer pelagic for plankton buoyant eggs larvae and small pelagic fish benthic for benthic groups and species living on the seabed such as flatfish and demersal for individuals living near the sea bed and having access to both pelagic and benthic prey such as gadoids the accessibility parameters are presented in table 3 2 4 calibration the model was calibrated using the calibrar r package with the ahr es algorithm oliveros ramos and shin 2016 an automatic evolutionary algorithm developed for calibrating stochastic models such as osmose this algorithm explores a range of values for unknown parameters and uses likelihood objective functions to select the optimal values for the catches and biomass to be comprised within ranges of observed values when available landings per species have been extracted from the ices fisheries statistics official database ices 2011a for the ices area 7d corresponding to the eec over the period 2000 2009 total stock biomass estimates are directly available from stock assessment reports for sole and plaice ices 2011b while for whiting cod mackerel and herring total stock biomass estimates were derived from stock assessments covering a wider area ices 2012 2011b and were therefore scaled to the eec proportional to the relative landings in this area in osmose species biomass is computed as the sum over the entire area of the biomass of all super individuals older than 6 months averaged annually simulated landings come from the fished individuals eq 3 over the entire area integrated at the annual time scale the calibration was performed in 3 phases following recommendations by oliveros ramos et al 2017 based on model dependency of the parameters and availability of initial estimates first the 10 ltl accessibility coefficients were adjusted for 200 generations then the 14 larval mortality rates were added to the set of parameters to adjust for 200 other generations finally 12 additional mortalities including fishing mortalities were added to the third phase where 300 generations were run with a total of 36 parameters to estimate the first two phases allow optimization of the calibration convergence while the third phase includes all the parameters and lasts longer to ensure that an optimal solution is reached 2 5 scenarios and exploration of simulated trophic patterns once the model is calibrated it is run for 120 years with the first 100 years corresponding to the spin up time during which the system stabilizes and is no longer driven by the model initialization the results presented thereafter corresponding to the average state of the eec ecosystem in the period 2000 2009 are computed from averaging the last 20 simulated years to smooth any interannual variability furthermore osmose is a stochastic model and 50 replicates were run using the same input parameters following the pattern oriented modeling approach pom grimm et al 2005 the model s ability to reproduce independent patterns is explored by comparing simulated output with data neither used during the parameterization nor during the calibration as the osmose model is based on opportunistic predation validation patterns could include emerging features linked to the predation process such as realized diets and associated tls or food web structures here we used independent data of tls calculated from nitrogen stable isotope ratios si measured on the same species in the same ecosystem cresson et al 2017 2018 jennings and van der molen 2015 kopp et al 2015 mialet et al 2017 tl calculations are based on the premise that the nitrogen isotopic ratio δ 15n hereafter is gradually enriched at each tl a phenomenon called trophic enrichment tl is thus considered as the isotopic difference between the species of interest and a trophic baseline i e a proxy of the ultimate organic matter source at the base of the food web divided by the trophic enrichment factor tef the queen scallop aequipecten opercularis was used as a trophic baseline due to the trophic importance of benthic production and because the use of a primary consumer i e at tl 2 allows smoothing of the small scale isotopic fluctuations of primary production that are not integrated in fish isotopic ratios two methods are used where tef is either considered the same at all levels of the food web e g in kopp et al 2015 cresson 2017 2018 mialet et al 2017 or decreases with increasing δ 15n of the diet jennings and van der molen 2015 details about the method can be found in dedicated literature hussey et al 2014 but sensitivity analyses demonstrated that for intermediate tl species such as the ones considered in the present study calculated tls are rather similar regardless of the method jennings and van der molen 2015 p cresson unpubl results in osmose each super individual has a proper tl which depends on its feeding history the tl computation of a super individual i is based on the classical formula in which the tl of a predator equals 1 plus the average tl of the prey weighted by their relative ingested biomass eq 6 6 t l i t 1 j t l j t d c j i t where tli t is the trophic level of i at time t and dcj i t is the proportion of prey j in the diet of predator i at time t while the tl of explicitly modeled individuals is dynamic the tl of the ltl groups is fixed and has been set to 1 for phytoplankton and derived from tl estimates based on stable isotope studies in the same area kopp et al 2015 for the other groups table 2 the tl of very small benthos is set to 3 to represent the omnivory of this group partly composed of meiofauna the tl of newly spawned eggs within osmose is arbitrarily set to 3 to be close to the tl of the first feeding larvae finally we assume that an individual that has not fed keeps its previous tl after comparison of simulated tls with data model exploration is performed by analyzing the variation of diet composition and tl with size for all species diet composition is computed using the following predefined size classes for predators 0 5 5 10 10 15 15 20 20 25 25 30 30 40 40 50 50 60 60 70 70 90 90 110 and 110 130 from all super individuals pertaining to a size class the biomasses of the different prey eaten including other super individuals and ltl groups are grouped by species over the entire area to explore the relationship between tl and size super individuals are grouped by centimeters and the tl distribution within each size group is computed min first quartile median third quartile max the tl size relationship is then explored spatially by fitting a linear model in each cell with more than 10 super individuals the resulting slope values are then mapped for each species with indication of the quality of the fit using r² values 3 results the evolutionary algorithm used for calibrating the model converged to an acceptable configuration where all median values of simulated biomass distribution are within the range of observed values fig 3 median values of simulated catches are within the range of observations for half of the species lesser spotted dogfish whiting cod mackerel sardine and squids while for red mullet horse mackerel and herring catches are underestimated as only 42 42 and 18 of the 50 simulated replicates are within the range of the observations respectively simulated catches of pouting sole and plaice are smaller than the observations median values corresponding to 73 57 and 80 of the minimal observed values respectively even if the biomass of the flatfish species corresponds to the total stock biomass estimates through the stock assessment ices 2011a for the other assessed species whiting cod mackerel and herring simulated biomass also displays a good fit to biomass estimated over the period of 2000 2009 the optimized values of accessibility parameters show high variability across the ltl groups from approximately 10 4 for dinoflagellates to approximately 0 4 for meso zooplankton and very large benthos table 2 two important prey groups for the fish community a comparison of simulation outputs with published tls from empirical si analysis is performed as a validation process fig 4 displays the trophic spectra of the modeled species i e for each species the distribution of the individual tl weighted by the individual biomass in the simulations the width of the trophic spectrum i e the difference between the maximal and minimal individual tls varies according to species from 1 6 levels for red mullet up to 3 9 levels for herring more importantly the way biomass is distributed along tls also varies for some species biomass distribution is concentrated around a particular tl e g approximately 3 9 for red mullet pouting poor cod dragonet sole while for other species biomass is spread over a wide range of tls e g whiting cod sardine squids the biomass concentration of approximately 3 9 for benthic fish species is linked to the dominant proportion of very small benthos and small benthos tl 3 and tl 2 9 respectively table 2 in the diet of these species fig 5 plaice individuals of intermediate length 15 50 cm also largely rely on these prey groups explaining the concentration of biomass around tl 3 8 in the trophic spectrum fig 4 the biomass around tl 4 5 is explained by the presence of very large benthos tl 3 6 in the diet of larger plaice individuals the wide trophic spectra of lesser spotted dogfish whiting and cod are explained by the diversity of prey composing their diets fig 5 simulated trophic spectra were in good agreement with the range of tls estimated from stable isotope measurements for most species for red mullet poor cod and plaice simulated tls were similar to si derived tls which were moreover coherent between empirical studies for lesser spotted dogfish pouting whiting sole horse mackerel and mackerel empirical data display high variability across studies but this variability is generally well encompassed by the model however empirical tl estimates show that the maximal tl observed for sole can be higher than that simulated while mackerel can have a minimal si derived tl smaller than that simulated it is worth noting that for mackerel the model simulates two tl modes approximately 3 6 and 4 3 corresponding respectively to young individuals feeding only on mesozooplankton tl 2 6 table 2 and larger individuals feeding on small squids and small fish mostly young sardine and horse mackerel fig 5 similarly empirical estimates of mackerel tl show low values of approximately 3 5 in cresson et al 2017 and jennings and van der molen 2015 with fish being between 16 9 and 41 cm long table 4 while tl values are higher than 4 in the three other studies but for similar fish lengths 18 to 34 cm table 4 if we assume that tl estimated from stable isotopes are representative of the trophic position of the bulk of a species then the eec osmose model tends to slightly overestimate the tl of cod dragonet and squids and to underestimate the tl for herring the si derived tl of sardine corresponds to the bulk of the simulated biomass but the model also simulates sardine individuals at a tl between 2 and 3 feeding on diatoms and mesozooplankton fig 5 to further explore the drivers of individual variability among species tl distribution the evolution of the mean tl with size is presented in fig 6 while mean tl generally increases with size for most species this is not the case for red mullet poor cod dragonet and sole and for pouting and plaice to a lesser extent respectively from 10 to 35 cm and from 20 to 50 cm for which the mean tl decreases with size these species are characterized by a benthic diet with the proportion of very small benthos tl 3 decreasing with size and the proportion of medium benthos tl 2 2 increasing as fish grow larger which explains the decreasing tl with size for these species the evolution of mean tl with size is not linear and most species display a strong change of tl at smaller size while mean tl varies less with size for larger individuals tipping points can be identified and linked to ontogenetic changes in the diets of species for instance sardine and herring fish longer than 20 cm no longer feed on diatoms fig 5 explaining the abrupt tl increase at this size other ecological features can be observed such as the marked shift from a plankton feeding larval stage roughly for fish smaller than 5 to 10 cm on fig 6 to a benthic feeding juvenile stage for all benthic and demersal species finally other tl breakpoints linked to diet shifts exist for larger fish the occurrence of very large benthos for lesser spotted dogfish larger than 30 cm pouting larger than 35 cm whiting larger than 15 cm cod larger than 20 cm and plaice larger than 50 cm and the disappearance of mesozooplankton for horse mackerel and mackerel larger than 20 cm to supplement the patterns observed over the entire area between tl and size the spatial distribution of the tl size relationship is mapped fig 7 the negative relationship between tl and size is confirmed in every grid cell for red mullet dragonet and sole this pattern appears robust r² 0 3 in the dover strait northeast in the north of the central english channel northwest and in the bay of seine south for poor cod another species showing a decreasing tl size relationship at the global scale the spatial distribution of the slope is less informative r² 0 3 but shows both positive and negative relationships the latter occurring also in the dover strait and north of the central english channel for plaice and pouting the relationship is positive in most cell grids and is probably driven by the strong difference of tl between fish of intermediate size and larger fish robust positive relationships between tl and size also occur for pouting herring sardine and squids 4 discussion 4 1 ability of the model to capture eec ecosystem dynamics in this study we were able to adapt the 2d osmose model using a vertical overlap matrix and apply it to the eec shallow ecosystem characterized by strong bentho pelagic coupling after parameterizing the model the semiautomatic calibration method produced an overall good fit of the model to the 2000 2009 average state of the eec ecosystem with biomass of all species and catch values of half of the species being within the range of the observed values the discrepancies observed for some species between modeled and observed catches and biomasses can be explained by several factors first a constant fishing mortality is applied in osmose to individuals older than the age at recruitment i e similar to broken stick selectivity with age while in reality due to the different fleet selectivity and variable catchability at age the fishing pressure endured by fish varies with age length quinn and deriso 1999 nonetheless it is worth noting that the total mortality varies with age within osmose notably due to explicit predation mortality which tends to decrease with size second the biomass target values come from single stock assessments i e correspond to model outputs with specific hypotheses and thus should be taken as estimates with associated uncertainty rather than exact values brooks and deroba 2015 similarly target catch values come from declared landings completed by estimates of discards when available even if the eec is considered a data rich ecosystem some uncertainties persist when estimating discards and total catches enever et al 2007 pauly and zeller 2016 furthermore the hypothesis made to allocate the biomass of widely distributed stock to the ices 7 d area based on the landings ratio does not take into account the spatial variability of fishing effort and assumes a homogeneous distribution of fish again contributing to the uncertainty around biomass target values third the calibration process was limited to the optimization of 36 unknown parameters therefore constraining the space of simulated output reachable during the calibration despite these limits the model was able to reproduce species biomasses and most species catches but also other features independent of the data used for parameterization and calibration for most species the simulated tls are in good accordance with tl estimates derived from si data both in terms of average values and variability within species however eec osmose underestimates sardine and herring mean tls compared to si estimates the exploration of simulated tl and diet composition versus size shows that the smaller size classes have a diet mostly composed of diatoms and mesozooplankton resulting in small tl values while the larger individuals rely on mesozooplankton explaining their higher tl one hypothesis for the difference observed between the data and the model is that empirical data underestimate the importance of phytoplankton food source this could be explained by the absence of very small individuals smaller than 5 cm for herring smaller than 7 7 cm for sardine table 4 in the sample and or by the sampling season autumn corresponding to higher zooplankton food available compared to phytoplankton another hypothesis is the biased simulation of diet shift from phytoplankton to zooplankton prey at larger size than observed for herring and sardine both species are known to consume these two types of prey with seasonally variable intensity costalago et al 2012 but the ontogenetic shift in their diet has been reported at an earlier larval stage e g denis et al 2016 these results suggest that the minimum and maximum predation size ratios set for herring and sardine may be revised possibly by setting different ratios according to individual ontogenetic development e g travers trolet et al 2014 moreover due to the model structure and lack of suitable stable isotope data the mesozooplankton group has a fixed tl that prevents simulation of the spatiotemporal variability of the tl of the zooplankton community available to fish it should nevertheless be remembered that fish stable isotope ratios and the derived tl values can be seen as emergent properties resulting from their diet but also from a large set of environmental or physiological parameters e g boecklen et al 2011 among these large spatial and temporal variations of phytoplankton isotopic ratios magozzi et al 2017 at the basis of the food web and or fish migrations between zones where primary production exhibits different isotopic ratios may drive changes in fish isotopic ratios that are hard to capture and that may blur tl calculation the overestimation of the trophic position of cod in the model comes with an overestimation of the proportion of fish in the diet the model simulates the proportion of fish biomass in cod diets as between 50 and 80 according to size classes while fish represent nearly one quarter or less of the prey found in stomach content analysis crustaceans being the main prey for juveniles and adults cachera 2013 pinnegar 2014 mialet et al 2017 this bias is due to the relatively simple accessibility matrix set for representing the proportion of prey biomass available to a predator according to their vertical distributions for this matrix cod is considered to be demersal i e to have full access to other demersal individuals and to have access to half of the pelagic biomass and half of the benthos biomass to better represent the feeding behavior of cod accessibility coefficients should be revised for instance by increasing accessibility to benthic prey and reducing accessibility to pelagic and demersal individuals for this study the accessibility matrix was introduced to mimic vertical overlap between predators and prey as required to model both benthic and pelagic communities with an opportunistic size based predation but its parameterization was kept as simple as possible for their coupled size spectrum model blanchard et al 2009 considered that all predators spent half of their time feeding on benthic invertebrates and the other half feeding on pelagic organisms future developments on how to better set these accessibility parameters could involve consideration of the spatial variability of trophic interactions e g depth driven variability in bentho pelagic coupling giraldo et al 2017 or use morphological attributes trait based approach of the different species e g orientation of the mouth 4 2 relationship between size and tl when considering tl with regard to size for the different species modeled two main patterns emerge from the simulations the most frequent pattern is an increase of tl as size increases which is often more pronounced for the smaller size classes this positive relationship can display some breakpoints linked to diet composition shifts as illustrated by planktivorous fish species at 20 cm the second pattern is observed for only four benthic species red mullet poor cod dragonet and sole and corresponds to a decrease of tl with increasing size for the small individuals of these four benthic species smaller than 5 10 cm the initial increase in tl is explained by the pelagic and planktivorous mode of the larvae before settlement on the sea bottom modeled through change of the accessibility predation coefficient table 3 in aquatic ecology the assumption that larger individuals have a higher tl is often admitted as predation is constrained by body size through gape limitation such a relationship has been explored and confirmed across species in various ecosystems by confronting the mean or maximum size of species with their mean δ 15n e g france et al 1998 romanuk et al 2011 however other studies have reported an absence of correlation between species mean length and their trophic position e g layman et al 2005 jennings et al 2001 also documented a weak cross species relationship between the maximum size of fish species and their mean δ 15n value but a strong relationship at the community level i e using the individual length of fish and pooling the data together within size classes the ontogenetic increase of tl with increasing size has also been confirmed for benthic fish species by badalamenti et al 2002 investigating the north sea trophic structure jennings et al 2002a found a significant positive relationship between fish length and δ 15n for 16 species over 31 more interestingly this relationship was found to be negative for herring and plaice whose tl decreases as their length increases in addition the pattern observed may be positive in one environment but negative in another jennings and van der molen 2015 the results obtained in the present study thus demonstrate that the variability may appear at even a lower spatial scale confirming the call for a better understanding of the effect of environmental gradients on trophic functioning ings et al 2009 based on stable isotope data in the eec kopp et al 2011 confirmed this decreasing trend of tl with size for plaice but also for skates and even for whiting in some particular habitats located in the central bay of seine and part of the dover strait in half of the region species combinations they studied jennings and van der molen 2015 observed no relationship between mass and tl and the positive relationships mostly occurred for piscivore species as they have to capture mobile prey gape size is a key factor driving feeding abilities in these species in benthic systems feeding mechanisms could be more based on opportunistic predation of carrion and living organisms in this context prey size may not be as important in driving the feeding mechanism as for pelagic systems while based on opportunistic size based predation osmose was unexpectedly able to reproduce decreasing trends of tl with size for some benthic species in eec osmose the benthic species demonstrating a clear declining tl trend with size are not the same as the benthic species found to display this pattern empirically however it is worth noting that the empirical negative relationship found for plaice between 9 and 48 cm jennings et al 2002a is partly present in the model if we focus on intermediate sized individuals i e before the introduction of very large benthos in the diet at about 50 cm being able to reproduce the negative tl size relationship using such a model allows for drawing two nonexclusive hypotheses of its origin first the spatial distribution of fish individuals changes with age appendix b which may result in different prey compositions being available locally including the case where only prey with lower tls are available in the area inhabited by larger fish individuals the spatial distribution of the tl size relationship confirms this spatial heterogeneity for some species thus the absence of squid eggs in the dover strait and the north central channel is linked to the strong tl size negative relationship observed in these areas where the benthic fish diet is only composed of benthic invertebrates for mackerel the absence of juveniles in the bay of seine explains the spatial heterogeneity of the signal and suggests that a negative tl size relationship could be observed empirically if focus was placed on the adults of this region in the current model spatially homogeneous benthic prey fields were used because insufficient knowledge of benthos dynamics was available at this scale the simulated trophic spatial variability would probably be higher if a more realistic benthic community was included in the model the second hypothesis underlying the simulated pattern is that conversely to what is largely admitted for the pelagic prey the trophic structure of the benthic prey is not linked to the size structure of the benthic invertebrate community in the diet of the simulated benthic fish the increasing proportion of medium benthos with a small tl compared to the proportion of small benthos with a higher tl leads mathematically to a tl decreasing with size at the predator level this pattern is linked to the predation hypothesis underlying the model and reflects the actual opportunistic pattern of the benthic fish species that consume the most available resources van denderen et al 2018 the selection of species used to set the tl of the benthic groups could have an impact on the overall tl size relationships of fish however they were selected because of their abundance in the area therefore they were considered suitable to represent the main prey available for fish only a few studies have investigated the relationship between size and trophic position for marine benthic invertebrates jennings et al 2002b demonstrated that for benthic invertebrates the relationship between size and tl reflected intraspecific patterns i e individual growth and not interspecific patterns i e no evidence for a relationship between maximum body size and tl across species similarly dinmore and jennings 2004 observed a negative relationship between tl and body mass demonstrating that body dimension may not be a major driver of predation in benthic systems in their coupled size based model blanchard et al 2009 confirmed that benthic invertebrates share a common size unstructured resource and therefore are not strongly trophically size structured in other words two benthic invertebrates of different sizes can exhibit the same tl as their diet would be the same an ontogenetic diet change in the predator could thus result in an inconclusive or decreasing length tl pattern 4 3 variability of tl across sources the current study benefited from the existence of several stable isotope analyses performed in the eec here we used the available tl estimates at the individual level and explored the intraspecies variability of si derived tls which increased both with the number of fish individuals sampled and with the width of body sizes sampled table 4 the high variability of tls within a species was confirmed by the model where individuals can have different tls depending on their size involving different size ranges of available prey their spatial location local encounters with different prey and the feeding history of their prey leading to different tls of the prey while the intraspecific tl variability from stable isotopes was required to validate the emergent patterns of the model the comparison of tl values between different si studies was also informative indeed the agreement observed between the five studies e g plaice increases the reliability of these estimates both in terms of value and width of distribution for sardine the very similar tl distribution observed between two studies counterbalances the low number of individuals sampled 10 in each study and therefore improves the reliability of these data while the five empirical studies provided similar estimates of species mean tls and variability for some species they can lead to different estimates of the tl for other species e g the lesser spotted dogfish mean tl goes from 3 5 to 4 8 the whiting mean tl ranges from 4 to 5 1 discrepancies between the empirical studies and with the model can be due to differences in sampling dates and therefore temporal variation of diet and integration dynamics seasonal and or interannual e g schafer et al 2002 the spatial location of sampling and its effect on diet kopp et al 2015 giraldo et al 2017 the variability of the trophic baseline used magozzi et al 2017 or hypothesis regarding tef hussey et al 2014 these intraspecific variations are nonetheless classically observed e g jennings and van der molen 2015 isotopic data allowed validation of the model but other trophic data sources could have been used to provide a complementary vision comparison with stomach content data allowed for a better understanding of the discrepancies regarding the cod tl the tl overestimation is linked to the overestimation of fish in the cod diet composition both isotopic and stomach content data sources are now considered complementary e g cresson et al 2014 giraldo et al 2017 the latter one informing a snapshot diet with identified prey while the former integrates trophic fluxes over months and allows us to quantify the fluxes between predators and a pool of prey of similar isotopic signatures the ecosystem model can now be added to the list of available tools to explore trophic function and individual variability of tls and could be used in a similar way to explore individual variability across seasons and or space i e at different depths 5 conclusion using a multispecies ibm constrained by size based opportunistic predation we were able to reproduce the average trophic structure of the eec over 2000 2009 including benthic and pelagic communities due to the individual variability in terms of size spatial location and feeding history the model simulations displayed patterns that were observed in empirical studies but were unexpected from a size based predation approach here the ibm framework has been shown to be effective in investigating among individual trophic variability and for understanding the plausible drivers of the negative tl size relationship observed empirically for some species the uncoupling of the trophic structure and size structure of benthic invertebrates appeared to be the key to this pattern but future studies should further explore this potential link and identify morphological aspects to better represent the predation of fish on benthic invertebrates the availability of tl estimates from stable isotopes has been a key to validating the model and encouraging strong collaborations between modelers and field laboratory scientists indeed while trophic data are often used to parameterize or validate ecosystem models pethybridge et al 2018 complex models and particularly ibms appear useful to inform on the trophic functioning of an ecosystem and to explore different hypotheses regarding the causes of observed patterns as the trophic patterns simulated with osmose have been validated for the eec the model will now be available to explore the ecosystem impacts of different scenarios including management measures and climate change the flexibility of the food web structure emerging from local interactions in osmose appears promising when aimed at exploring the cumulative impacts of different pressures acknowledgments this study was

24993,sweet chestnut coppice castanea sativa mill is a species of great importance in the northwest of spain due to its potential for producing valuable timber in relatively short rotations however abandonment has resulted in unstable and degraded stands thus there is a need to improve forestry decision making tools the objective of this study is the development of a dynamic stand growth model for the sweet chestnut comprised of three transition functions dominant height basal area and number of stems per hectare they are used to estimate rates of change in the stand between an initial point in time and a point in the future the data comes from two inventories of an unmanaged network of plots which incorporate all the variability in conditions in the region for the study species climate soil stocking site quality etc ada and gada approaches were used to develop the three transition functions the model achieved high accuracy explaining 90 of variability the model incorporates an initialization function explaining 60 of variability for predicting initial stand basal area in stands without diameter inventories which can be used to establish the starting point for the simulation and in addition the biomass expansion factor bef for this species expressed as a constant value of 0 60 and a new single aboveground biomass equation explaining almost 80 of variability were calculated a case study shows how to apply these decision making tools for the sustainable management of sweet chestnut coppice keywords castanea sativa mill algebraic difference equations transition functions initialization function biomass equation biomass expansion factor 1 introduction with the rise of the green economy the demand for a wide range of wood products is increasing orazio et al 2017 this has stimulated the growth of the forest based sector while highlighting the need to guarantee sustainable forestry practices as such growth and yield models that forecast forest dynamics over time are vital for sustainable forest management decision making and planning one way to achieve this characterization of forest changes over time is by using forest stand growth models of which there are many nowadays they have been classified by baker and robinson 2010 as either empirical process based gap or hybrid models empirical models are developed using statistical techniques and inventory data and aim to describe growth using tree or stand attributes e g basal area growth process based models try to use other variables such as photosynthesis or respiration to predict growth along with certain external variables that influences them such as climate or soil conditions gap models are used in small areas to describe the growth and mortality of individual trees due to abiotic and biotic factors hybrid models combine elements of empirical and process based models a model can be considered to be a synthesis of certain aspects of reality linking this definition with the dynamics of a forest stand a forest stand growth model is an abstraction of the natural dynamics of the forest stand and can predict stand growth mortality and other natural changes in structure and composition vanclay 1994 dynamic whole stand growth models are empirical models which are suitable for a variety of purposes such as inventory updating management scheduling and planning and estimating stand structure for different stand conditions castedo dorado et al 2007a such models are composed of a set of mathematical equations that use data pertaining to the present or past state of a stand to predict the future or past state of a forest stand cieszewski 2003 in other words in a dynamic growth model it is essential to have data for a number from given points in time state variables and a projection or transition function that expresses the different rates of change under various stand growth conditions garcía 1988 in fact the prediction or forecasting of forest growth is obtained by integrating these rates of change to give a trajectory when measurements at two or more times are no available i e data is available for just one point in time only static growth models can be developed and these are only able to directly predict the values not the trajectories themselves garcía 1998 the data required to develop dynamic models thus needs to come from either permanent plots or from stem analysis as they can provide the trajectories of the variables over time permanent plots although time consuming and expensive to set up provide a range of valuable data while on the other hand stem analysis has the advantage of data being obtained more quickly and at a lower cost burkhart and tomé 2012 dynamic stand models are particularly recommended for even aged pure stands garcía 1988 1993 vanclay 1994 and have the advantage of the simplicity of using aggregate and stand variables such as dominant height stems per hectare and basal area for their predictions gonzález garcía et al 2015 a review of the forest models developed in spain compiled by bravo et al 2011 revealed that most are for conifer species and that there is consequently a lack of information regarding broadleaf species in response to this and given the importance of developing dynamic growth models to support decision making in forest management and planning the present study develops a dynamic growth model for the broadleaf species sweet chestnut castanea sativa mill sweet chestnut is well represented in the northwest of spain especially in the autonomous region of asturias fig 1 where it is a native species roces díaz et al 2018 according to the fourth national forest inventory forest covers a total of 453 700 ha dgcn 2012 which is 46 of the total surface area of the region with sweet chestnut covering a total of 80 560 ha i e 17 75 of the forested area the average total wood volume with bark of sweet chestnut stands harvested in the region of asturias in 2016 was 30 987 m3 sadei 2018 making it one of the most important broadleaf species in the northwest of spain due to its potential for producing valuable timber in relatively short rotations in the past this species had an important role in terms of both fruit production and the production of timber principally for construction furniture woodworking fine veneer flooring general joinery and poles logs vega et al 2012 despite this many traditional coppice stands have degraded over the last 30 60 years as a result of partial or total abandonment menéndez miguélez et al 2013 there have though in recent years been renewed efforts to recover the value of sweet chestnut there is therefore interest from public administrations and other stakeholders in the sustainable long term active management of sweet chestnut stands and a consequent need for detailed information at different levels in fact between 2009 and 2012 the ministry of science and innovation of spain micin and the plan for science technology and innovation of the principality of asturias pcti funded the research project forest and industrial evaluation of spanish chestnut valocas as a consequence the first management tools for sweet chestnut were developed however they are static tools namely stand biomass and volume equations and static yield models yield tables and stand density management diagrams menéndez miguélez et al 2015 and thus provide little in the way of support to the medium and long term management of chestnut stands due to the importance of this species in the northwest of spain the sweet chestnut has also been studied from the perspective of evaluating the effects of climate soil nutrients and environmental factors on site productivity afif khouri et al 2011 menéndez miguélez et al 2015 the growing use of forest biomass as a primary source of energy has also led to research as regards its energy production potential álvarez álvarez et al 2018 as well as its role in carbon sequestration prada et al 2016 once again however to date this line of research has not provided information to accurately reproduce the evolution of sweet chestnut stands over time the development of dynamic tools is therefore a necessity in order to be able to predict the rates of changes in stand biomass in the future and to inform and optimize forest management decision making with respect to sweet chestnut consequently in order to help in decision making and support forest managers and forest wood sector industries in optimizing production through sustainable forest management the main goals of this study were as follows 1 to develop a dynamic stand growth model for sweet chestnut coppice in northwest spain that comprises three transition functions that estimate dominant height basal area and reduction in tree number per hectare 2 to fit a stand basal area prediction or initialization function to provide an initial value of stand basal area at a given age for use in areas where such information is not available 3 to calculate for the first time a sweet chestnut biomass expansion factor bef which indicates stock growth volume or biomass and provides managers with a tool for considering sweet chestnut stands from an economic perspective and 4 to adjust one single equation rather than the existing model which uses four equations menéndez miguélez et al 2013 to complement existing forest management tools and the dynamic growth model 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in sweet chestnut coppice stands castanea sativa mill in the north of the iberian peninsula in the autonomous region of asturias spain fig 1 the data were obtained from 32 circular permanent plots 15 m radius located between 189 and 875 m a s l and differing in orientation and slope range 19 to 75 the average annual temperature of the area is 10 11 c and annual rainfall ranges from 987 to 1351 mm soil ph in the plots varies between 3 77 and 4 79 and the textural regimes are sandy loam and sandy clay loam the plots were carefully chosen throughout the study area in order to represent the full range of ages densities site qualities and edaphoclimatic conditions present in the area of distribution of this species for data collection two winter inventories were carried out the first across 2009 2010 and the second in 2018 each tree in every plot was labelled and diameter at breast height d diameter at 1 3 m above the top of the stool in cm was measured with a tree calliper to the nearest 0 1 cm as well as total height h to the nearest 0 1 m using a digital hypsometer descriptive variables were also documented such as if trees were dead or alive the stand age was estimated by felling a sweet chestnut tree just outside each plot and counting its rings see menéndez miguélez et al 2013 the stand variables calculated for each plot and inventory were number of trees per hectare n basal area g dominant height h 0 taken as the mean height of the 100 thickest trees per hectare biomass w and volume v only live trees were included in the calculations the equations used to estimate w and v from the inventory data were developed for this study area by menéndez miguélez et al 2013 2014 summary statistics of the stands including mean minimum maximum and standard deviation are shown in table 1 2 2 model structure and development a dynamic growth model uses the generalized mathematical expression y1 f t1 t 0 y 0 where y 1 is the value of the function at age t 1 and y 0 is the value of the function at age t 0 the proposed dynamic stand growth model is based on the state space approach garcía 1994 which uses stand state variables to describe the forest system at an initial point in time y 0 t 0 and transition functions to forecast stand growth in the future y1 t1 fig 2 these carefully chosen transition functions are used to predict stand growth variables and must comply with certain properties bailey and clutter 1974 parresol and vissage 1998 cieszewski 2003 base age invariance path invariance polymorphism logical behaviour parsimony sigmoid pattern with an inflexion point and horizontal asymptote at old ages these attributes can be achieved by the derivation of a dynamic equation using algebraic difference equations through two different approaches the algebraic difference approach ada bailey and clutter 1974 and the generalized algebraic difference approach gada cieszewski and bailey 2000 with ada the growth of a given variable is constructed by a family of curves originating from a base model with a single parameter while gada permits the incorporation of more than one site specific parameter both cases require the expansion of the initial two dimensional base equation y f t into an explicit three dimensional site equation y f t x where cross sectional and longitudinal variation is described using two independent variables t and x however the functional definition of x is not possible and nor can it be measured reliably and thus it is substituted by the initial conditions t 1 and y 1 y f t t 1 y 1 in order that the model can be useful in the field cieszewski and bailey 2000 cieszewski 2001 2002 2003 in this work both ada and gada approaches were used to develop three transition functions basal area g dominant height h0 and reduction in tree number n in order to predict the rate of change in growth of sweet chestnut stands at any point in time in the case of reduction in tree number other independent functions were also tested in addition to ada and gada approaches see section 2 2 3 for unthinned stands basal area and dominant height should be sufficient to describe the status of the stand pienaar and turnbull 1973 however it is essential to consider the intraspecific competition that occurs in a forest stand particularly in unthinned stands amateis et al 1997 davis et al 2001 diéguez aranda et al 2005b and as such the number of stems per hectare is also required the outputs of these three variables are directly related to calculate other important variables such as volume and biomass 2 3 transition function for dominant height and stand basal area and stand basal area initialization function a wide range of mathematical equations can be used to describe growth in dominant height and or basal area in this study three different base equations were chosen to develop the transition functions korf lundqvist 1957 hossfeld 1822 and bertalanffy richards bertalanffy 1949 1957 richards 1959 all of which are biologically based growth functions the integral form of these functions are very useful for projecting dominant height and stand basal area over time because they meet the requirements mentioned in the previous section and have been widely used in modelling barrio anta et al 2008 castedo dorado et al 2007b cieszewski 2002 diéguez aranda et al 2006 nunes et al 2010 each was converted into algebraic difference equations with both approaches ada where only one parameter of the base model is free and gada where two model parameters are free resulting in twelve different models being fitted table 2 these two methods differ in the types of models that they can be derived from with ada as just one site specific parameter is replaced in the base model the resulting models were either anamorphic or had just one asymptote bailey and clutter 1974 cieszewski and bailey 2000 however with gada as more than one site specific parameter can be derived the models obtained are polymorphic and have multiple asymptotes cieszewski 2003 cieszewski and bailey 2000 model numbers 4 8 and 12 were derived by applying gada while the rest of the models were obtained by ada the stand basal area transition function needs for a given age an initial basal area value this initial value is normally obtained from forest inventories where diameter at breast height d is measured and in such cases the dynamic model of basal area prediction can be achieved using only the transition function tomé et al 2001 barrio anta et al 2006 castedo dorado et al 2007b gonzález garcía et al 2015 however when there is no inventory or d is not known stand basal area can be estimated from an initialization function based on other stand variables in such cases therefore the basal area growth model comprises two dynamic equations the transition function and the initialization function compatibility between the two functions is guaranteed barrio anta et al 2006 castedo dorado et al 2007b gonzález garcía et al 2015 when 1 the transition and initialization functions are obtained and derived from the same base growth model 2 the site specific parameters of the initialization function whether linear or non linear are based on stand variables that do not vary over time e g site index and 3 both the initialization function and the transition function use the same values for the non site specific parameters of the base equation 2 4 transition function for reduction in tree number per hectare the transition function for reduction in tree number is related with mortality that is the natural reduction in number of trees as a result of stand density droughts and other environmental factors álvarez gonzález et al 2004 in fact mortality is an important component of stand growth and plays a significant part in growth predictions there are different types of mortality regular and irregular regular mortality is due to competition for light water and soil nutrients within a stand peet and christensen 1987 while irregular mortality is associated with catastrophic events such as snow fire wind or insect attack where survival probability is unpredictable at stand level alenius et al 2003 only regular mortality is considered when modelling survival probability woollons 1998 diéguez aranda et al 2005b as a result of its importance reduction in tree number per hectare over time has been investigated widely using the two step modelling strategy proposed by woollons 1998 with this strategy two equations are adjusted one of which predicts survival probability using all plots with and without regular mortality while the second is only adjusted for plots where regular mortality occurs finally the estimates must be adapted using deterministic or stochastic approaches however diéguez aranda et al 2005b compared the two approaches and concluded that only one equation should be used when regular mortality is very frequent as in the case of overstocked and unthinned stands that is the case of the sweet chestnut stands studied here since they had received no silvicultural treatment so just one equation was adjusted following the methodology suggested by diéguez aranda et al 2005b table 3 shows the mathematical expressions of the mortality base models used to define the reduction in tree number per hectare transition function 2 5 fitting of biomass expansion factor bef and above ground biomass equation in the case of above ground biomass the existing stand biomass model for asturias menéndez miguélez et al 2013 consists of four equations and so in a bid to simplify the process for forest managers a new adjustment was made in order to establish one single equation that can be used to do so the total above ground biomass and its components were regressed on stand variables using the following function 1 w i β 0 x β 1 e i where w i represents the biomass at stand level mg ha 1 x denotes the dependent stand variable β 0 and β 1 are parameters and e i is the model error the heteroscedasticity inherent to biomass equations was corrected by weighted regression using the method proposed by harvey 1976 and the homoscedasticity of the residues was checked by white s test white 1980 the biomass expansion factor bef is one of the most important tools for transforming tree or stand variables into biomass estimates it relates volume and biomass meaning that one can be calculated from the other and is therefore a valuable complement to dynamic growth models although volume and biomass equations of sweet chestnut coppice already exist there is no bef tool for this species for the purposes of this study bef was calculated for each plot following this equation 2 b e f i w i v i where bef i is the biomass expansion factor mg m3 w i is dry weight of above ground biomass mg ha 1 calculated with the above ground biomass equation developed in this work and v i is the total stand volume over bark m3 ha 1 estimated by the equation developed by menéndez miguélez et al 2016 for sweet chestnut coppice where the explanatory variables g and h 0 accounted for more than 99 of total variation the bef for all plots was then summed and averaged to provide a novel bef specific to sweet chestnut 2 6 model fitting evaluation and validation the three transition functions n g h 0 were fitted simultaneously using the seemingly unrelated regression technique for non linear models nsur implemented in the sas ets model procedure sas institute inc 2004 and executing the method known as the dummy variable approach cieszewski et al 2000 simultaneous fitting is a two step process first the three transition functions are fitted individually and the best model for each one is selected second with the models selected in step one a simultaneous re fitting is undertaken this reduces the total sum of squares errors of the selected models and the correlations among residuals of the three stand variables the dummy variable approach was used because variables that are measured directly in the forest always contain some environmental and measurement errors the dummy approach takes into account these errors and does not force the model lack of autocorrelation was assured by the durbin and watson s test 1951 and by graphical examination in order to maintain compatibility between basal area transition and initialization functions once the transition function was fitted the non site specific parameters were substituted in the base growth model of the initialization function and were then fitted individually to estimate the remaining site specific parameters numerical and graphical evaluation was used to compare the different fitted models and to select the best transition function for n g h 0 and the best biomass equation the numerical assessment involved calculating goodness of fit statistics the root mean square error rmse and the adjusted coefficient of determination r a d j 2 the rmse is expressed in the same units as the dependent variable which is very useful because it gives an idea of the mean error when using the model the r a d j 2 shows the proportion of variation explained by the model to detect possible systematic discrepancies and test the logical behaviour of the models the graphs of the fitted transition functions were overlaid on the observed trajectories validation is important in terms of evaluating the accuracy of any models developed however this is best achieved through the use of independent data sets when this is not possible vanclay and skovsgaard 1997 offers two solutions 1 the available data is divided in two one set is used for parameterization and the other for the validation process or 2 re sampling techniques should be used such as cross validation in the present work no independent validation data set was available and so press statistics myers 1986 were used for validation the press residuals is a leave one out cross validation process which considers the difference between the observed value and the predicted value whereby one piece of data in turn is omitted from the analysis to fit the model and the model is fitted to the remaining n 1 data the technique has been used in a number of similar studies burk 1990 soares and tomé 2001 2002 sánchez gonzález et al 2007 paulo and tomé 2009 gonzález garcía et al 2015 the goodness of fit statistics for the press analysis were designated as r 2 adj p and rmse p 2 7 case study the dynamic model obtained in the present study is presented here in case study form to demonstrate how the model and equations developed can be applied in the field the first step is to find out the following variables at a given age t 0 for the area to be managed dominant height h 00 m basal area g 0 m2 ha 1 and stems per hectare n 0 stems ha 1 this data is collected in forest inventories but if such an inventory is not available users need to use the basal area initialization function next the period of time which the user wishes to evaluate should be decided upon and the three transition functions that comprise the dynamic stand growth model developed in this study should be applied in order to get the estimates of stand variables h 01 g 1 and n 1 at age t 1 before and after projecting the stand variables the merchantable volume can be calculated with the equation developed for this species in the study area by menéndez miguélez et al 2016 and above ground stand biomass can be calculated using either the bef provided here or the above ground biomass equation also developed in this study additionally cai current annual increment m3 ha 1 year 1 can be calculated which is another variable of great interest for forest users 3 results 3 1 transition function of dominant height the model selected eq 3 for the transition function of dominant height

significant at p 5 this model showed suitable graphical behaviour as well as no heteroscedasticity or trends in lag residues against residuals with a random pattern around zero fig 3 the absence of autocorrelation was confirmed by the durbin watson test d w which gave a value of 2 87 and a p value for testing positive pr d w of 0 345 and a negative autocorrelation pr d w of 0 654 3 2 transition function of stand basal area prediction function the model formulation m10 based on bertalanffy richards see clutter et al 1983 for stand basal area with b 1 as site specific parameter was selected for the transition function of this variable this selection was based on the appropriateness of the graphs fig 4 as well as and the high predictive ability of the model as presumed from the goodness of fit statistics was considered the absence of autocorrelation was also confirmed by the durbin watson test d w which gave a value of 2 77 and a p value for testing positive pr d w of 0 174 and negative autocorrelation pr d w of 0 825 the model is expressed as follows 4 g 1 60 2861 1 1 g 0 60 2861 1 0 7335 t 1 t 0 0 7335 r 2 adj p 91 08 rmse p 2 98m2ha 1 where g 1 basal area m2 ha 1 at age t 1 years and g 0 basal area m2 ha 1 at age t 0 years the basal area initialization function which is used when no diameter inventory data is available was developed after the transition function first to ensure compatibility the bertalanffy richards base equation m10 was also used to develop the basal area initialization function the previously estimated parameters of the basal area transition function were exchanged for the value of their equivalent parameters in the initialization function however the explanatory power of the model was not high 30 as a consequence other stand variables and formulations were included in this base model in order to improve the predictive power of the equation the final equation explained 60 3 of variation based on press residuals and the rmse p value was 6 30 m2 ha 1 all parameters were significant at the 5 level the plots of residuals against estimated values demonstrated no detectable trends in this context the best results were obtained when

and n 0 1300 stems ha 1 the chosen projection time for this example is 10 years so the three state variables are projected into the future at age t 1 52 years using the transition functions developed in this study as shown in fig 6 thus using the stand variables from the previous step users of this tool can calculate volume and aboveground biomass at both age t 0 and at t 1 as indicated in fig 7 as well as obtaining an estimate of cai another way of calculating above ground biomass from volume data and viceversa is by multiplying data with the bef factor calculated in this study 4 discussion this study presents valuable information for forest managers and forest wood sector industries of sweet chestnut coppice by providing tools which contribute to optimizing production through sustainable forest management the dynamic growth model presented in this study is a stand model for sweet chestnut coppice in northwest spain it is formed of three transition functions h 0 g n that appropriately describe the rate of change of the corresponding state variables in addition other state variables of interest such as volume and biomass can be attained through using known data for these same state variables all the models for the three state variables h 0 g n were evaluated and compared using statistical criteria and graphical analysis most of the models analysed explained more than 90 of total variation but some gada models resulted in no parameters being found to be significant while others produced no convergence this is perhaps because gada models require data from early stages when there is asymptotic growth in order to fit the equation the graphs of the trajectories fig 3 4 and 5 demonstrate a logical biological tendency between the observed and predicted data moreover the fact that all the equations were developed through models based on a non linear approach ensures that all the essential criteria related to model estimation and logical behaviour are complied with cieszewski and strub 2018 comparing the goodness of fit for selecting the best model in the case of dominant height the ada models for the choice of the final model selection of this state variable were m1 m2 m5 and m6 all of them had a variation of 95 and rmse p was 0 75 for m1 and 0 73 for the rest of the models as a consequence graphical analysis played an important role in the selection the m2 model was discarded immediately because the graphical analysis did not show logical behaviour among the other models m5 was selected because it performed best in terms of graphical analysis the rest of the models whose results are not presented were discarded as they did not result in significant parameters in other studies there is considerable variation in the dominant height model selected depending on the species studies and the specific site characteristics diéguez aranda et al 2005a gómez garcía et al 2014 rojo alboreca et al 2017 relating to the stand basal area transition function m10 was chosen as the one which performed best from among the short list of m2 m6 m9 and m10 statistical analysis showed these models respectively have a variation based on press residuals of 0 97 0 98 0 97 and 0 97 and an rmse p of 1 72 1 50 1 71 in contrast to the selection of the best dominant height model in this case graphical analysis showed that all the short listed models fitted well i e they showed logical behaviour however although m6 had the highest r 2 adj p and the lowest rmse p the model finally selected for basal area was m10 because it showed the most logical behaviour in the graphical analysis a number of other studies have also found this model for basal area prediction to be the best fit such as barrio anta et al 2008 and gonzález garcía et al 2015 although other works have found the korf model to be the best fit such as castedo dorado et al 2007a and diéguez aranda et al 2006 the stand basal area initialization function was not compatible with the stand basal area transition function as the explanatory power of the model was not high 30 probably because the number of trees per hectare varies over time as has been found in previous studies e g castedo dorado et al 2007a b as a consequence other stand variables and formulations were included in this base model in order to improve the predictive power of the equation in fact other studies have achieved considerable improvements by including different stand variables in the initialization function leading to the conclusion that it is not necessary to use the same base model for the transition equation as for the initialization function diéguez aranda et al 2006 castedo dorado et al 2007b gómez garcía et al 2014 gonzález garcía et al 2015 furthermore this is not a major problem as the initialization function would be used to give an initial value of this state variable and not to provide trajectories over time gómez garcía et al 2014 in terms of the adjusted coefficient of determination r a d j 2 p in other dynamic growth models developed for broadleaf species this parameter has been found to be 47 9 and 77 4 for oak and birch respectively gómez garcía et al 2010 and 73 9 for eucalyptus nitens gonzález garcía et al 2015 these results concur with those obtained in this study of the broadleaf species sweet chestnut 60 3 in contrast to studies with conifers where basal area initialization functions are around 90 barrio anta et al 2006 castedo dorado et al 2007b diéguez aranda et al 2005a the selected transition function for reduction in tree number m17 was the only one where all parameters were significant this model is not the one selected in other studies although there is no agreement between studies as to the best model for this parameter álvarez gonzález et al 2004 diéguez aranda et al 2005b castedo dorado et al 2007a gómez garcía et al 2014 tewari et al 2014 some of them included other variables such as site index in their formulation which indicated that better productivity was related to higher mortality gómez garcía et al 2014 diéguez aranda et al 2005b yao et al 2001 although other studies found the opposite woollons 1998 as a result the reduction in tree number variable is not a simple one to find an effective model for in this study the inclusion of site index as an explanatory variable did not improve the estimates as happened in a previous study castedo dorado et al 2007a the role of climate change was also explored in the selection of these dynamic growth models at the outset climatic variables were considered for inclusion in the model the results of the tests found no significant parameters for any of the three models by the expansion of the parameters as sub functions climate variables in the literature many recent dynamic growth models include climatic variables in order to address the issue of planning for climate change scenarios bravo oviedo et al 2008 gonzález garcía et al 2015 wang et al 2007 however nunes et al 2010 stated that although some authors assert that models with climate variables help to assess the effect of climate change on the growth patterns the findings must be interpreted cautiously as they could result in misleading conclusions consequently although climate dynamics are not integrated in the models developed in this study these models still provide a valuable tool to inform sustainable forest management plans for sweet chestnut stands particularly in light of the growing interest in and demand for wood related products in the future process based models or other type of models can be developed that respond to these requirements and consider the climate as well as other characteristics of the environment that are important for the development of forest stands the biomass equation adjusted in this study differs from those previously adjusted for this species menéndez miguélez et al 2013 in that r a d j 2 was found to be 20 higher on the one hand it is true that other studies have generally included additional parameters such as dominant diameter or quadratic mean diameter barrio anta et al 2006 castedo dorado et al 2009 menéndez miguélez et al 2013 in their biomass equations because they improve the estimates on the other hand in the literature in order to increase variability the majority of the equations are comprised of a group of equations for individual tree estimates e g gómez garcía et al 2010 ruiz peinado et al 2012 and the use of volume and biomass equations to describe the allometry of single trees is a strength in this respect because it reduces bias lehtonen et al 2004 petersson et al 2012 such equations are however more difficult for forest managers to apply and one aim of this work was to provide a simpler biomass equation which is more efficient for forest managers to use bef is known to sometimes be inaccurate when its calculation depends on the age and density of the stand black et al 2004 tobin and nieuwenhuis 2007 in the present study bef is a factor not an equation so it should be treated with caution and applied only in the same conditions as that of the stands used here to develop it comparing the results of the biomass equations with the bef value shows an error of estimate of 26 which is like that of other bef studies i e black et al 2004 petersson et al 2012 bef equations provided more accurate predictions as has been shown in other studies gonzález garcía et al 2015 so in the future bef equations rather than the factor presented here should be developed for sweet chestnut in order to improve estimates and to provide forest managers with better tools 5 conclusions a number of well known growth functions were considered in order to develop a dynamic growth model for sweet chestnut coppice in northwestern spain three different transition functions form the dynamic growth model basal area dominant height and reduction in number of stems per hectare for dominant height and basal area the best models were ada with a constant single asymptote the model selected as the most appropriate function to predict reduction in tree number was that developed by tomé et al 1997 all the selected models provided accurate predictions for sweet chestnut coppice in the region and explained more than 90 of variation for cases where there is no diameter inventory data available a basal area initialization function which explained 60 3 of variation was developed after the transition function the bef and the biomass equation provided in this study are recommended and practically useful to complement the dynamic growth model these models can be used in other locations as long as these are within the range of variability taken into account for the adjustment of these models age densities edaphoclimatic conditions etc and they are useful tools to inform sustainable forest management planning acknowledgements the authors wish to thank forest

24993,sweet chestnut coppice castanea sativa mill is a species of great importance in the northwest of spain due to its potential for producing valuable timber in relatively short rotations however abandonment has resulted in unstable and degraded stands thus there is a need to improve forestry decision making tools the objective of this study is the development of a dynamic stand growth model for the sweet chestnut comprised of three transition functions dominant height basal area and number of stems per hectare they are used to estimate rates of change in the stand between an initial point in time and a point in the future the data comes from two inventories of an unmanaged network of plots which incorporate all the variability in conditions in the region for the study species climate soil stocking site quality etc ada and gada approaches were used to develop the three transition functions the model achieved high accuracy explaining 90 of variability the model incorporates an initialization function explaining 60 of variability for predicting initial stand basal area in stands without diameter inventories which can be used to establish the starting point for the simulation and in addition the biomass expansion factor bef for this species expressed as a constant value of 0 60 and a new single aboveground biomass equation explaining almost 80 of variability were calculated a case study shows how to apply these decision making tools for the sustainable management of sweet chestnut coppice keywords castanea sativa mill algebraic difference equations transition functions initialization function biomass equation biomass expansion factor 1 introduction with the rise of the green economy the demand for a wide range of wood products is increasing orazio et al 2017 this has stimulated the growth of the forest based sector while highlighting the need to guarantee sustainable forestry practices as such growth and yield models that forecast forest dynamics over time are vital for sustainable forest management decision making and planning one way to achieve this characterization of forest changes over time is by using forest stand growth models of which there are many nowadays they have been classified by baker and robinson 2010 as either empirical process based gap or hybrid models empirical models are developed using statistical techniques and inventory data and aim to describe growth using tree or stand attributes e g basal area growth process based models try to use other variables such as photosynthesis or respiration to predict growth along with certain external variables that influences them such as climate or soil conditions gap models are used in small areas to describe the growth and mortality of individual trees due to abiotic and biotic factors hybrid models combine elements of empirical and process based models a model can be considered to be a synthesis of certain aspects of reality linking this definition with the dynamics of a forest stand a forest stand growth model is an abstraction of the natural dynamics of the forest stand and can predict stand growth mortality and other natural changes in structure and composition vanclay 1994 dynamic whole stand growth models are empirical models which are suitable for a variety of purposes such as inventory updating management scheduling and planning and estimating stand structure for different stand conditions castedo dorado et al 2007a such models are composed of a set of mathematical equations that use data pertaining to the present or past state of a stand to predict the future or past state of a forest stand cieszewski 2003 in other words in a dynamic growth model it is essential to have data for a number from given points in time state variables and a projection or transition function that expresses the different rates of change under various stand growth conditions garcía 1988 in fact the prediction or forecasting of forest growth is obtained by integrating these rates of change to give a trajectory when measurements at two or more times are no available i e data is available for just one point in time only static growth models can be developed and these are only able to directly predict the values not the trajectories themselves garcía 1998 the data required to develop dynamic models thus needs to come from either permanent plots or from stem analysis as they can provide the trajectories of the variables over time permanent plots although time consuming and expensive to set up provide a range of valuable data while on the other hand stem analysis has the advantage of data being obtained more quickly and at a lower cost burkhart and tomé 2012 dynamic stand models are particularly recommended for even aged pure stands garcía 1988 1993 vanclay 1994 and have the advantage of the simplicity of using aggregate and stand variables such as dominant height stems per hectare and basal area for their predictions gonzález garcía et al 2015 a review of the forest models developed in spain compiled by bravo et al 2011 revealed that most are for conifer species and that there is consequently a lack of information regarding broadleaf species in response to this and given the importance of developing dynamic growth models to support decision making in forest management and planning the present study develops a dynamic growth model for the broadleaf species sweet chestnut castanea sativa mill sweet chestnut is well represented in the northwest of spain especially in the autonomous region of asturias fig 1 where it is a native species roces díaz et al 2018 according to the fourth national forest inventory forest covers a total of 453 700 ha dgcn 2012 which is 46 of the total surface area of the region with sweet chestnut covering a total of 80 560 ha i e 17 75 of the forested area the average total wood volume with bark of sweet chestnut stands harvested in the region of asturias in 2016 was 30 987 m3 sadei 2018 making it one of the most important broadleaf species in the northwest of spain due to its potential for producing valuable timber in relatively short rotations in the past this species had an important role in terms of both fruit production and the production of timber principally for construction furniture woodworking fine veneer flooring general joinery and poles logs vega et al 2012 despite this many traditional coppice stands have degraded over the last 30 60 years as a result of partial or total abandonment menéndez miguélez et al 2013 there have though in recent years been renewed efforts to recover the value of sweet chestnut there is therefore interest from public administrations and other stakeholders in the sustainable long term active management of sweet chestnut stands and a consequent need for detailed information at different levels in fact between 2009 and 2012 the ministry of science and innovation of spain micin and the plan for science technology and innovation of the principality of asturias pcti funded the research project forest and industrial evaluation of spanish chestnut valocas as a consequence the first management tools for sweet chestnut were developed however they are static tools namely stand biomass and volume equations and static yield models yield tables and stand density management diagrams menéndez miguélez et al 2015 and thus provide little in the way of support to the medium and long term management of chestnut stands due to the importance of this species in the northwest of spain the sweet chestnut has also been studied from the perspective of evaluating the effects of climate soil nutrients and environmental factors on site productivity afif khouri et al 2011 menéndez miguélez et al 2015 the growing use of forest biomass as a primary source of energy has also led to research as regards its energy production potential álvarez álvarez et al 2018 as well as its role in carbon sequestration prada et al 2016 once again however to date this line of research has not provided information to accurately reproduce the evolution of sweet chestnut stands over time the development of dynamic tools is therefore a necessity in order to be able to predict the rates of changes in stand biomass in the future and to inform and optimize forest management decision making with respect to sweet chestnut consequently in order to help in decision making and support forest managers and forest wood sector industries in optimizing production through sustainable forest management the main goals of this study were as follows 1 to develop a dynamic stand growth model for sweet chestnut coppice in northwest spain that comprises three transition functions that estimate dominant height basal area and reduction in tree number per hectare 2 to fit a stand basal area prediction or initialization function to provide an initial value of stand basal area at a given age for use in areas where such information is not available 3 to calculate for the first time a sweet chestnut biomass expansion factor bef which indicates stock growth volume or biomass and provides managers with a tool for considering sweet chestnut stands from an economic perspective and 4 to adjust one single equation rather than the existing model which uses four equations menéndez miguélez et al 2013 to complement existing forest management tools and the dynamic growth model 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in sweet chestnut coppice stands castanea sativa mill in the north of the iberian peninsula in the autonomous region of asturias spain fig 1 the data were obtained from 32 circular permanent plots 15 m radius located between 189 and 875 m a s l and differing in orientation and slope range 19 to 75 the average annual temperature of the area is 10 11 c and annual rainfall ranges from 987 to 1351 mm soil ph in the plots varies between 3 77 and 4 79 and the textural regimes are sandy loam and sandy clay loam the plots were carefully chosen throughout the study area in order to represent the full range of ages densities site qualities and edaphoclimatic conditions present in the area of distribution of this species for data collection two winter inventories were carried out the first across 2009 2010 and the second in 2018 each tree in every plot was labelled and diameter at breast height d diameter at 1 3 m above the top of the stool in cm was measured with a tree calliper to the nearest 0 1 cm as well as total height h to the nearest 0 1 m using a digital hypsometer descriptive variables were also documented such as if trees were dead or alive the stand age was estimated by felling a sweet chestnut tree just outside each plot and counting its rings see menéndez miguélez et al 2013 the stand variables calculated for each plot and inventory were number of trees per hectare n basal area g dominant height h 0 taken as the mean height of the 100 thickest trees per hectare biomass w and volume v only live trees were included in the calculations the equations used to estimate w and v from the inventory data were developed for this study area by menéndez miguélez et al 2013 2014 summary statistics of the stands including mean minimum maximum and standard deviation are shown in table 1 2 2 model structure and development a dynamic growth model uses the generalized mathematical expression y1 f t1 t 0 y 0 where y 1 is the value of the function at age t 1 and y 0 is the value of the function at age t 0 the proposed dynamic stand growth model is based on the state space approach garcía 1994 which uses stand state variables to describe the forest system at an initial point in time y 0 t 0 and transition functions to forecast stand growth in the future y1 t1 fig 2 these carefully chosen transition functions are used to predict stand growth variables and must comply with certain properties bailey and clutter 1974 parresol and vissage 1998 cieszewski 2003 base age invariance path invariance polymorphism logical behaviour parsimony sigmoid pattern with an inflexion point and horizontal asymptote at old ages these attributes can be achieved by the derivation of a dynamic equation using algebraic difference equations through two different approaches the algebraic difference approach ada bailey and clutter 1974 and the generalized algebraic difference approach gada cieszewski and bailey 2000 with ada the growth of a given variable is constructed by a family of curves originating from a base model with a single parameter while gada permits the incorporation of more than one site specific parameter both cases require the expansion of the initial two dimensional base equation y f t into an explicit three dimensional site equation y f t x where cross sectional and longitudinal variation is described using two independent variables t and x however the functional definition of x is not possible and nor can it be measured reliably and thus it is substituted by the initial conditions t 1 and y 1 y f t t 1 y 1 in order that the model can be useful in the field cieszewski and bailey 2000 cieszewski 2001 2002 2003 in this work both ada and gada approaches were used to develop three transition functions basal area g dominant height h0 and reduction in tree number n in order to predict the rate of change in growth of sweet chestnut stands at any point in time in the case of reduction in tree number other independent functions were also tested in addition to ada and gada approaches see section 2 2 3 for unthinned stands basal area and dominant height should be sufficient to describe the status of the stand pienaar and turnbull 1973 however it is essential to consider the intraspecific competition that occurs in a forest stand particularly in unthinned stands amateis et al 1997 davis et al 2001 diéguez aranda et al 2005b and as such the number of stems per hectare is also required the outputs of these three variables are directly related to calculate other important variables such as volume and biomass 2 3 transition function for dominant height and stand basal area and stand basal area initialization function a wide range of mathematical equations can be used to describe growth in dominant height and or basal area in this study three different base equations were chosen to develop the transition functions korf lundqvist 1957 hossfeld 1822 and bertalanffy richards bertalanffy 1949 1957 richards 1959 all of which are biologically based growth functions the integral form of these functions are very useful for projecting dominant height and stand basal area over time because they meet the requirements mentioned in the previous section and have been widely used in modelling barrio anta et al 2008 castedo dorado et al 2007b cieszewski 2002 diéguez aranda et al 2006 nunes et al 2010 each was converted into algebraic difference equations with both approaches ada where only one parameter of the base model is free and gada where two model parameters are free resulting in twelve different models being fitted table 2 these two methods differ in the types of models that they can be derived from with ada as just one site specific parameter is replaced in the base model the resulting models were either anamorphic or had just one asymptote bailey and clutter 1974 cieszewski and bailey 2000 however with gada as more than one site specific parameter can be derived the models obtained are polymorphic and have multiple asymptotes cieszewski 2003 cieszewski and bailey 2000 model numbers 4 8 and 12 were derived by applying gada while the rest of the models were obtained by ada the stand basal area transition function needs for a given age an initial basal area value this initial value is normally obtained from forest inventories where diameter at breast height d is measured and in such cases the dynamic model of basal area prediction can be achieved using only the transition function tomé et al 2001 barrio anta et al 2006 castedo dorado et al 2007b gonzález garcía et al 2015 however when there is no inventory or d is not known stand basal area can be estimated from an initialization function based on other stand variables in such cases therefore the basal area growth model comprises two dynamic equations the transition function and the initialization function compatibility between the two functions is guaranteed barrio anta et al 2006 castedo dorado et al 2007b gonzález garcía et al 2015 when 1 the transition and initialization functions are obtained and derived from the same base growth model 2 the site specific parameters of the initialization function whether linear or non linear are based on stand variables that do not vary over time e g site index and 3 both the initialization function and the transition function use the same values for the non site specific parameters of the base equation 2 4 transition function for reduction in tree number per hectare the transition function for reduction in tree number is related with mortality that is the natural reduction in number of trees as a result of stand density droughts and other environmental factors álvarez gonzález et al 2004 in fact mortality is an important component of stand growth and plays a significant part in growth predictions there are different types of mortality regular and irregular regular mortality is due to competition for light water and soil nutrients within a stand peet and christensen 1987 while irregular mortality is associated with catastrophic events such as snow fire wind or insect attack where survival probability is unpredictable at stand level alenius et al 2003 only regular mortality is considered when modelling survival probability woollons 1998 diéguez aranda et al 2005b as a result of its importance reduction in tree number per hectare over time has been investigated widely using the two step modelling strategy proposed by woollons 1998 with this strategy two equations are adjusted one of which predicts survival probability using all plots with and without regular mortality while the second is only adjusted for plots where regular mortality occurs finally the estimates must be adapted using deterministic or stochastic approaches however diéguez aranda et al 2005b compared the two approaches and concluded that only one equation should be used when regular mortality is very frequent as in the case of overstocked and unthinned stands that is the case of the sweet chestnut stands studied here since they had received no silvicultural treatment so just one equation was adjusted following the methodology suggested by diéguez aranda et al 2005b table 3 shows the mathematical expressions of the mortality base models used to define the reduction in tree number per hectare transition function 2 5 fitting of biomass expansion factor bef and above ground biomass equation in the case of above ground biomass the existing stand biomass model for asturias menéndez miguélez et al 2013 consists of four equations and so in a bid to simplify the process for forest managers a new adjustment was made in order to establish one single equation that can be used to do so the total above ground biomass and its components were regressed on stand variables using the following function 1 w i β 0 x β 1 e i where w i represents the biomass at stand level mg ha 1 x denotes the dependent stand variable β 0 and β 1 are parameters and e i is the model error the heteroscedasticity inherent to biomass equations was corrected by weighted regression using the method proposed by harvey 1976 and the homoscedasticity of the residues was checked by white s test white 1980 the biomass expansion factor bef is one of the most important tools for transforming tree or stand variables into biomass estimates it relates volume and biomass meaning that one can be calculated from the other and is therefore a valuable complement to dynamic growth models although volume and biomass equations of sweet chestnut coppice already exist there is no bef tool for this species for the purposes of this study bef was calculated for each plot following this equation 2 b e f i w i v i where bef i is the biomass expansion factor mg m3 w i is dry weight of above ground biomass mg ha 1 calculated with the above ground biomass equation developed in this work and v i is the total stand volume over bark m3 ha 1 estimated by the equation developed by menéndez miguélez et al 2016 for sweet chestnut coppice where the explanatory variables g and h 0 accounted for more than 99 of total variation the bef for all plots was then summed and averaged to provide a novel bef specific to sweet chestnut 2 6 model fitting evaluation and validation the three transition functions n g h 0 were fitted simultaneously using the seemingly unrelated regression technique for non linear models nsur implemented in the sas ets model procedure sas institute inc 2004 and executing the method known as the dummy variable approach cieszewski et al 2000 simultaneous fitting is a two step process first the three transition functions are fitted individually and the best model for each one is selected second with the models selected in step one a simultaneous re fitting is undertaken this reduces the total sum of squares errors of the selected models and the correlations among residuals of the three stand variables the dummy variable approach was used because variables that are measured directly in the forest always contain some environmental and measurement errors the dummy approach takes into account these errors and does not force the model lack of autocorrelation was assured by the durbin and watson s test 1951 and by graphical examination in order to maintain compatibility between basal area transition and initialization functions once the transition function was fitted the non site specific parameters were substituted in the base growth model of the initialization function and were then fitted individually to estimate the remaining site specific parameters numerical and graphical evaluation was used to compare the different fitted models and to select the best transition function for n g h 0 and the best biomass equation the numerical assessment involved calculating goodness of fit statistics the root mean square error rmse and the adjusted coefficient of determination r a d j 2 the rmse is expressed in the same units as the dependent variable which is very useful because it gives an idea of the mean error when using the model the r a d j 2 shows the proportion of variation explained by the model to detect possible systematic discrepancies and test the logical behaviour of the models the graphs of the fitted transition functions were overlaid on the observed trajectories validation is important in terms of evaluating the accuracy of any models developed however this is best achieved through the use of independent data sets when this is not possible vanclay and skovsgaard 1997 offers two solutions 1 the available data is divided in two one set is used for parameterization and the other for the validation process or 2 re sampling techniques should be used such as cross validation in the present work no independent validation data set was available and so press statistics myers 1986 were used for validation the press residuals is a leave one out cross validation process which considers the difference between the observed value and the predicted

2 7 case study the dynamic model obtained in the present study is presented here in case study form to demonstrate how the model and equations developed can be applied in the field the first step is to find out the following variables at a given age t 0 for the area to be managed dominant height h 00 m basal area g 0 m2 ha 1 and stems per hectare n 0 stems ha 1 this data is collected in forest inventories but if such an inventory is not available users need to use the basal area initialization function next the period of time which the user wishes to evaluate should be decided upon and the three transition functions that comprise the dynamic stand growth model developed in this study should be applied in order to get the estimates of stand variables h 01 g 1 and n 1 at age t 1 before and after projecting the stand variables the merchantable volume can be calculated with the equation developed for this species in the study area by menéndez miguélez et al 2016 and above ground stand biomass can be calculated using either the bef provided here or the above ground biomass equation also developed in this study additionally cai current annual increment m3 ha 1 year 1 can be calculated which is another variable of great interest for forest users 3 results 3 1 transition function of dominant height the model selected eq 3 for the transition function of dominant height

to ensure compatibility the bertalanffy richards base equation m10 was also used to develop the basal area initialization function the previously estimated parameters of the basal area transition function were exchanged for the value of their equivalent parameters in the initialization function however the explanatory power of the model was not high 30 as a consequence other stand variables

deviation of 0 13 mg m 3 3 5 example of case study a practical example of how to use the equations developed in this study is presented in this section the starting data is a forest stand with an si of 15 22 m near si curve of 16 m at the reference age of 20 years for sweet chestnut which is the second site quality curve with the following state variables at t 0 42 years g 0 48 m2 ha 1 h 01 22 m and n 0 1300 stems ha 1 the chosen projection time for this example is 10 years so the three state variables are projected into the future at age t 1 52 years using the transition functions developed in this study as shown in fig 6 thus using the stand variables from the previous step users of this tool can calculate volume and aboveground biomass at both age t 0 and at t 1 as indicated in fig 7 as well as obtaining an estimate of cai another way of calculating above ground biomass from volume data and viceversa is by multiplying data with the bef factor calculated in this study 4 discussion this study presents valuable information for forest managers and forest wood sector industries of sweet chestnut coppice by providing tools which contribute to optimizing production through sustainable forest management the dynamic growth model presented in this study is a stand model for sweet chestnut coppice in northwest spain it is formed of three transition functions h 0 g n that appropriately describe the rate of change of the corresponding state variables in addition other state variables of interest such as volume and biomass can be attained through using known data for these same state variables all the models for the three state variables h 0 g n were evaluated and compared using statistical criteria and graphical analysis most of the models analysed explained more than 90 of total variation but some gada models resulted in no parameters being found to be significant while others produced no convergence this is perhaps because gada models require data from early stages when there is asymptotic growth in order to fit the equation the graphs of the trajectories fig 3 4 and 5 demonstrate a logical biological tendency between the observed and predicted data moreover the fact that all the equations were developed through models based on a non linear approach ensures that all the essential criteria related to model estimation and logical behaviour are complied with cieszewski and strub 2018 comparing the goodness of fit for selecting the best model in the case of dominant height the ada models for the choice of the final model selection of this state variable were m1 m2 m5 and m6 all of them had a variation of 95 and rmse p was 0 75 for m1 and 0 73 for the rest of the models as a consequence graphical analysis played an important role in the selection the m2 model was discarded immediately because the graphical analysis did not show logical behaviour among the other models m5 was selected because it performed best in terms of graphical analysis the rest of the models whose results are not presented were discarded as they did not result in significant parameters in other studies there is considerable variation in the dominant height model selected depending on the species studies and the specific site characteristics diéguez aranda et al 2005a gómez garcía et al 2014 rojo alboreca et al 2017 relating to the stand basal area transition function m10 was chosen as the one which performed best from among the short list of m2 m6 m9 and m10 statistical analysis showed these models respectively have a variation based on press residuals of 0 97 0 98 0 97 and 0 97 and an rmse p of 1 72 1 50 1 71 in contrast to the selection of the best dominant height model in this case graphical analysis showed that all the short listed models fitted well i e they showed logical behaviour however although m6 had the highest r 2 adj p and the lowest rmse p the model finally selected for basal area was m10 because it showed the most logical behaviour in the graphical analysis a number of other studies have also found this model for basal area prediction to be the best fit such as barrio anta et al 2008 and gonzález garcía et al 2015 although other works have found the korf model to be the best fit such as castedo dorado et al 2007a and diéguez aranda et al 2006 the stand basal area initialization function was not compatible with the stand basal area transition function as the explanatory power of the model was not high 30 probably because the number of trees per hectare varies over time as has been found in previous studies e g castedo dorado et al 2007a b as a consequence other stand variables and formulations were included in this base model in order to improve the predictive power of the equation in fact other studies have achieved considerable improvements by including different stand variables in the initialization function leading to the conclusion that it is not necessary to use the same base model for the transition equation as for the initialization function diéguez aranda et al 2006 castedo dorado et al 2007b gómez garcía et al 2014 gonzález garcía et al 2015 furthermore this is not a major problem as the initialization function would be used to give an initial value of this state variable and not to provide trajectories over time gómez garcía et al 2014 in terms of the adjusted coefficient of determination r a d j 2 p in other dynamic growth models developed for broadleaf species this parameter has been found to be 47 9 and 77 4 for oak and birch respectively gómez garcía et al 2010 and 73 9 for eucalyptus nitens gonzález garcía et al 2015 these results concur with those obtained in this study of the broadleaf species sweet chestnut 60 3 in contrast to studies with conifers where basal area initialization functions are around 90 barrio anta et al 2006 castedo dorado et al 2007b diéguez aranda et al 2005a the selected transition function for reduction in tree number m17 was the only one where all parameters were significant this model is not the one selected in other studies although there is no agreement between studies as to the best model for this parameter álvarez gonzález et al 2004 diéguez aranda et al 2005b castedo dorado et al 2007a gómez garcía et al 2014 tewari et al 2014 some of them included other variables such as site index in their formulation which indicated that better productivity was related to higher mortality gómez garcía et al 2014 diéguez aranda et al 2005b yao et al 2001 although other studies found the opposite woollons 1998 as a result the reduction in tree number variable is not a simple one to find an effective model for in this study the inclusion of site index as an explanatory variable did not improve the estimates as happened in a previous study castedo dorado et al 2007a the role of climate change was also explored in the selection of these dynamic growth models at the outset climatic variables were considered for inclusion in the model the results of the tests found no significant parameters for any of the three models by the expansion of the parameters as sub functions climate variables in the literature many recent dynamic growth models include climatic variables in order to address the issue of planning for climate change scenarios bravo oviedo et al 2008 gonzález garcía et al 2015 wang et al 2007 however nunes et al 2010 stated that although some authors assert that models with climate variables help to assess the effect of climate change on the growth patterns the findings must be interpreted cautiously as they could result in misleading conclusions consequently although climate dynamics are not integrated in the models developed in this study these models still provide a valuable tool to inform sustainable forest management plans for sweet chestnut stands particularly in light of the growing interest in and demand for wood related products in the future process based models or other type of models can be developed that respond to these requirements and consider the climate as well as other characteristics of the environment that are important for the development of forest stands the biomass equation adjusted in this study differs from those previously adjusted for this species menéndez miguélez et al 2013 in that r a d j 2 was found to be 20 higher on the one hand it is true that other studies have generally included additional parameters such as dominant diameter or quadratic mean diameter barrio anta et al 2006 castedo dorado et al 2009 menéndez miguélez et al 2013 in their biomass equations because they improve the estimates on the other hand in the literature in order to increase variability the majority of the equations are comprised of a group of equations for individual tree estimates e g gómez garcía et al 2010 ruiz peinado et al 2012 and the use of volume and biomass equations to describe the allometry of single trees is a strength in this respect because it reduces bias lehtonen et al 2004 petersson et al 2012 such equations are however more difficult for forest managers to apply and one aim of this work was to provide a simpler biomass equation which is more efficient for forest managers to use bef is known to sometimes be inaccurate when its calculation depends on the age and density of the stand black et al 2004 tobin and nieuwenhuis 2007 in the present study bef is a factor not an equation so it should be treated with caution and applied only in the same conditions as that of the stands used here to develop it comparing the results of the biomass equations with the bef value shows an error of estimate of 26 which is like that of other bef studies i e black et al 2004 petersson et al 2012 bef equations provided more accurate predictions as has been shown in other studies gonzález garcía et al 2015 so in the future bef equations rather than the factor presented here should be developed for sweet chestnut in order to improve estimates and to provide forest managers with better tools 5 conclusions a number of well known growth functions were considered in order to develop a dynamic growth model for sweet chestnut coppice in northwestern spain three different transition functions form the dynamic growth model basal area dominant height and reduction in number of stems per hectare for dominant height and basal area the best models were ada with a constant single asymptote the model selected as the most appropriate function to predict reduction in tree number was that developed by tomé et al 1997 all the selected models provided accurate predictions for sweet chestnut coppice in the region and explained more than 90 of variation for cases where there is no diameter inventory data available a basal area initialization function which explained 60 3 of variation was developed after the transition function the bef and the biomass equation provided in this study are recommended and practically useful to complement the dynamic growth model these models can be used in other locations as long as these are within the range of variability taken into account for the adjustment of these models age densities edaphoclimatic conditions etc and they are useful tools to inform sustainable forest management planning acknowledgements the authors wish to thank forest

24994,our understanding of how energy shapes animal behavioural decisions has been limited by the difficulty of measuring directly the energy gain and expenditure in free living animals mechanistic models that simulate energy gain and expenditure from estimable parameters can overcome these limitations and hence could help scientists to gain a predictive understanding of animal behaviour such models could be used to test mechanistic explanations of observed patterns of resource use within a landscape such as behavioural decisions to switch among food resources here we developed mechanistic models of the instantaneous and daily rates of net energy gain for two species of migratory swans the bewick s swan cygnus columbianus bewickii and whooper swan cygnus cygnus that feed on root and cereal crops within an agricultural landscape in eastern england field data show that both species shift from using predominantly root crops e g sugar beet and potatoes in early winter to using mostly cereals e g wheat in late winter our models correspondingly predicted that swans could achieve the greatest rates of net energy gain on root crops in early winter and on cereal crops in late winter the change from root crops to cereal crops providing the greatest net rates of energy gain was predicted to occur at the same time as the birds switch from feeding predominantly on root crops to predominantly cereal crops between december and january we used monte carlo simulations to account for variance in model parameters on predictions of energy gain and profitability a sensitivity analysis indicated that predictions of net energy gain were most sensitive to variance in the intake rate and food quantity parameters the agreement between our model estimates of energy gain and the observed shifts in resource use observed among the overwintering swans suggests that maximising net rates of energy gain is an important resource selection strategy among overwintering birds a mechanistic understanding of where and when birds will use food resources can inform the conservation management of key feeding areas for species of conservation concern as well as the deployment of crop protection strategies keywords behavioural ecology energetics mechanistic models optimal foraging resource selection 1 introduction understanding why animals show temporal variation in their use of limited resources such as food remains a major focus for ecologists in the twenty first century prins and van langevelde 2008 davis et al 2014 different resources within a landscape offer foraging animals different rates of energy and nutrient gain but may also expose individuals to different rates of predation parasitism and pathogen exposure as well as anthropogenic disturbance macarthur and pianka 1966 schoener 1971 hence the pattern of resources available within a landscape influences the patterns of movements of animals e g clausen et al 2018 tucker et al 2019 in particular resource specific rates of net energy gain play a key role in animals selection of feeding resources nolet and klaassen 2009 babin et al 2011 wood et al 2013 however the net rates of energy gain that animals can achieve whilst feeding are not constant fluctuating with variations in the quantity and quality of the food available owen et al 1992 gates et al 2001 tinkler et al 2009 daniels et al 2019 the most profitable food resources for a foraging animal therefore will likely vary in space and time highly mobile animals including avian herbivores can move readily between different food resources within a landscape to track the most profitable resource drent and prins 1987 hence resource heterogeneity within a landscape can result in temporal shifts in resource use by foragers e g prins and ydenberg 1985 vickery et al 1995 mckay et al 1994 nolet et al 2002 inger et al 2006 wood et al 2013 agricultural landscapes can provide a range of energy rich food resources for herbivorous animals gordon 2009 in northwest europe overwintering bewick s swans cygnus columbianus bewickii and whooper swans cygnus cygnus feed predominantly on agricultural food resources such as cereals e g wheat triticum aestivum as well as the unharvested remains of root crops e g sugar beet beta vulgaris and potatoes solanum tuberosum dirksen et al 1991 rees et al 1997 wood et al 2019 root crops are preferred in early winter while cereal crops are preferred in late winter a pattern that has been consistent since the 1970s wood et al 2019 overwintering swans must select food resources that allow them to replace energy spent during their autumn migration and to gain the reserves required for their return flight and reproduction hence the selection of food resources by swans and other herbivorous capital breeders has important implications for subsequent survival and reproduction and hence fitness prop and black 1998 at high densities swans feeding on growing crops such as cereals can impact crop growth rates and yields laubek 1995 colhoun and day 2002 in contrast swans feeding on post harvest remains of root crops may benefit farmers as it delays the switch onto more valuable cereals gill 1996 yet despite the ecological and economic implications of swan use of agricultural habitats during winter the mechanisms that underpin the observed shifts between different arable resources such as root and cereal crops are not well understood accurately measuring rates of energy gain and loss in wild animals under field conditions is difficult hammond and diamond 1997 mechanistic models which simulate systems from their component parts connolly et al 2017 offer an alternative approach whereby rates of net energy gains can be simulated from measurable component parameters such as resource quantity and energetic quality as well as forager intake rates assimilation efficiency and energy expenditure bauer et al 2006 nolet and klaassen 2009 wood et al 2013 chudzińska et al 2016 whilst deterministic models have used mean parameter values to produce fixed estimates of energy gain e g wood et al 2013 in reality there will be variance associated with each mean parameter values due to both spatiotemporal variance and measurement error for example crop biomass will vary temporally as the crop grows and is harvested as well as spatially due to differences in factors such as soil nutrient concentrations and moisture content day and intalap 1970 carew et al 2009 chudzińska et al 2016 such variability could influence the relative profitability of different food resources and so needs to be taken into account when developing mechanistic foraging models valuable ecological insight can be gained from understanding how variations in some parameters have disproportionately large effects on rates of forager energy gain and hence resource selection indeed variance in some parameters will have relatively large effects on model predictions compared whilst variance in other parameters may have little effect on predictions and so may not need to be included in a model for example wood et al 2013 used a mechanistic foraging model to show that a seasonal switch by mute swans cygnus olor from terrestrial to aquatic foraging was instigated by declines in water velocity which reduced the energetic cost of aquatic foraging rather than changes in food biomass or energy content furthermore as the data used to parameterise models cost time money and other resources to collect no more data should be collected than necessary to build a model capable of producing accurate predictions and hence parsimony has long been a guiding principle in model development mulligan and wainwright 2004 therefore modellers need to use tools such as sensitivity and robustness analyses to identify the relative influence of parameters on model predictions and hence facilitate the development of parsimonious models levins 1966 grimm and berger 2016 in this study we constructed mechanistic models of swan energy gain and loss to examine the role of energetics in temporal patterns of resource selection by overwintering swans our first hypothesis was that the patterns in simulated net energy gains and resource profitability would show the same temporal patterns as observed swan resource use with a shift over winter from predominant use of root crops in early winter to a predominant use of cereal crops in late winter our second hypothesis was that variability in food quantity i e root biomass and cereal sward height would have a greater influence on seasonal changes in the simulated rates of energy gain compared with variation in food quality i e crop energy content as food quantity typically shows greater seasonal variability than food quality in arable systems e g mckay et al 1994 2 methods 2 1 study system the ouse washes 52 27 n 0 11 e and surrounding farmland is an internationally important site for both bewick s and whooper swans with the highest numbers occurring between november and february rees et al 1997 wood et al 2019 this extensive area of seasonally flooded wet grassland is used by the swans as a roost and both species fly to feed on agricultural crops grazing on growing cereals such as wheat and grubbing for post harvest remains of root crops such as sugar beet and potatoes on fields in the surrounding area during the day rees et al 1997 wood et al 2019 in early winter the swans feed predominantly on root crops before progressively switching to cereal crops rees et al 1997 wood et al 2019 the field measurements undertaken for our study were carried out during winter 2016 17 on a 15 4 km2 area of farmland comprising 1 8 km2 and 5 0 km2 of root and cereal crop fields respectively with the remaining area composed of other crops or fallow fields surrounding the ouse washes at southery fens 52 30 n 0 23 e a major feeding area approximately 7 5 km south east of the main roost site 2 2 swan resource use surveys to determine the relative use of different food resources co ordinated surveys of the areas of the ouse washes and surrounding fens used by swans were undertaken during daylight hours at monthly intervals from october to march inclusive between winters 1976 77 and 2016 2017 wood et al 2019 on encountering swans during the surveys the total number of individuals present and crop type were recorded to allow the total numbers and proportions of those totals using each crop type to be calculated further details of the survey methodology have been reported by wood et al 2019 in this study we grouped crops into the following categories autumn winter sown cereals e g wheat and post harvest remains of root crops e g sugar beet and potatoes alternative crops such as oilseed rape and pasture grasses were not considered further as together cereals and root crops account for 89 of the total number of swans observed wood et al 2019 fig 1 wood et al 2019 found that swans showed a within winter pattern of foraging that was consistent between the 1970s and 2010s whereby root crops were used predominantly in early winter november december and cereal crops were most used in late winter january march 2 3 overview of mechanistic modelling approach we developed mechanistic models to simulate predictions of swan net energy gain based on combinations of the following parameters i forager food intake rates ii food quantity root biomass and cereal height iii food quality energy content iv forager food assimilation efficiency v forager energy expenditure and vi foraging effort per day the instantaneous i e per second net energy gain was simulated from parameters i v whilst the net energy gain per 24 h day was simulated from parameters i vi see section 2 9 for both the instantaneous and daily models we used monte carlo simulations to account for variance in the model parameters our models made predictions of net energy gain on each resource type for each swan species and for each month in order to test our two hypotheses as such these predictions represent corroboratory predictions sensu maris et al 2018 in the following sections we describe the derivation of all model parameter values the structure of the models the monte carlo procedure the processes of model validation and the analyses of model sensitivity and robustness 2 4 food quantity to derive the values of cereal sward height required to estimate the swan s food intake rates we measured sward height in all 25 cereal fields within our study area each month between november 2016 and march 2017 inclusive we used the direct measurement method whereby a hand is placed lightly onto the vegetation to the level below which approximately 80 of the vegetation is estimated by eye to be growing then measuring this height 5 mm using a ruler stewart et al 2001 each month 10 sward height measurements were taken per field per visit to estimate the monthly mean average height for that field based on the sample sizes used by mckay et al 1994 who previously measured changes in winter cereal sward height between november and march in the uk randomised sampling was achieved by measuring at 10 sets of random number generated x y co ordinates based on field length and width to quantify the monthly cereal sward heights for our study area we calculated the mean average sd of the mean sward height values recorded for each field in each month fig 2 a between month variation in cereal height was assessed using a one way analysis of variance in r r development core team 2018 with month modelled as a categorical variable and post hoc differences between months were evaluated using tukey s hsd the model residuals were checked to ensure that test assumptions were met additionally in one cereal field that was representative of the study area in size and farming practices we harvested all aboveground cereal tissues within 0 00785 m2 areas n 20 to enable the determination of energy content see section 2 6 prior to analysis each sample was dried to constant mass at 60 c using a genlab pro 100 general purpose oven genlab usa we estimated the biomass of root crops available to the swans in each month from measurements in 6 sugar beet and 4 potato fields which represented all of the root crop fields within our study area as swans feed only on the post harvest remains of root crops rees et al 1997 wood et al 2019 our measurements began after the fields had been harvested in each month we excavated all post harvest remains of root crops within 1 m2 patches n 10 per field per month randomised sampling was achieved by excavating at 10 sets of random number generated x y co ordinates based on field length and width non crop material e g soil was removed from each sample with the fresh weight determined 0 1 g using a pesola pts3000 digital balance pesola präzisionswaagen ag switzerland each sample was dried to constant mass as described above before dry mass was measured the mean sd root crop dry matter biomass for a given month was then estimated based on all field specific mean values across all sugar beet and potato fields fig 2b between month variation in root biomass was assessed using a one way analysis of variance 2 5 swan intake rates the functional response describes the relationship between forager food intake rates and food density sensu holling 1959 many avian herbivores show type i or type ii functional responses whereby the food intake rate shows an increase with food density up to an asymptote and a decelerating increase with food density up to an asymptote respectively e g durant et al 2003 wood et al 2013 a type i functional response equation models intake rate based on the forager s rate of discovery of food items a measure of search efficiency termed attack rate whilst a type ii functional response equation models intake rate based on the attack rate and the time required to capture and ingest food items termed handling time holling 1959 to model the intake rate of swans feeding on cereals we used the mean sd parameters attack rate and handling time of the type ii functional response curve reported by durant et al 2003 for greylag geese anser anser another grazing anseriform species foraging on pasture grass which we scaled to our swan species we are not aware of any published functional response studies for waterfowl feeding on growing cereals however accurate estimates of intake rate can be obtained from allometric scaling because earlier meta analyses of ducks geese and swans have demonstrated that the food intake rate of herbivorous waterfowl is strongly related to species body mass r2 72 wood et al 2012 see also van gils et al 2007 the original equation reported by durant et al 2003 was expressed in mg dry matter hereafter dm min 1 which we converted to g dm s 1 to match the scale of the other parameters in our models the intake rate was scaled for our swan species from the original greylag goose values following the approach of baveco et al 2011 whereby the equation is adjusted for body mass with a mass exponent of 0 71 van gils et al 2007 therefore we modelled the intake rate ic g dm s 1 for swans feeding on cereal crops as 1 ic a hmonth 1 b hmonth 1 000 60 ms mg 0 71 where the hmonth was the mean sd sward height in cm for a given month mg was the mean body mass of a greylag goose 3270 g matthews and campbell 1969 ms was the mean body mass of the foraging swan species 6000 g and 9700 g for a bewick s and whooper swan respectively kear 2005 the mean sd values of the attack rate a and handling time b were 173 94 cm2 s 1 and 0 12 0 12 s g 1 respectively durant et al 2003 we modified the functional response for swans foraging on root crops from that given for bewick s swans feeding on root crops by baveco et al 2011 2 ir a dr where ir was the intake rate g dm s 1 a was the attack rate and dr was the root crop dry matter biomass density g dm m 2 to estimate the attack rate a for our study system we first converted the energy intake rate ie for swans feeding on sugar beet in early winter of approximately 462 j s 1 reported by baveco et al 2011 to a food intake rate expressed in g dm s 1 ir based on the dry matter energy content of root crops er sampled in early winter 2016 17 during our study of 15 138 j dm g 1 as follows 3 ir ie er the early winter value was used for consistency with the methodology of baveco et al 2011 we rearranged the functional response formula of baveco et al 2011 as 4 a ir dr which for our early winter root crop biomass density of 68 2 g dm m 2 gave an estimated mean attack rate a of 0 00045 m2 s 1 in the absence of published estimates we assumed that the standard deviation of the root crop attack rate would be a fixed proportion of the mean equivalent to the mean and standard deviation of the cereal crop attack rate 94 173 0 54 as attack rate in both cases is governed by the same biomechanical processes which yielded a standard deviation for the root crop attack rate of 0 00024 m2 s 1 this bewick s swan attack rate was scaled for whooper swans following the approach of baveco et al 2011 whereby the equation is adjusted for body mass with a mass exponent of 0 71 van gils et al 2007 therefore we modelled the intake rate g dm s 1 for swans feeding on root crops in our study system as 5 ir 0 00045 0 00027 ms mb 0 71 dr where mb was the body mass of a bewick s swan and ms was the body mass of the foraging swan species as given in eq 1 above 2 6 food energy content to determine the energy content j g 1 dm of each food resource 500 1 mg dm of each food resource sample cereal or root crop collected during field sampling see section 2 4 was analysed via bomb calorimetry using a parr 1108 oxygen combustion bomb parr instrument company illinois usa to yield a mean sd estimate for each food resource we analysed 5 randomly selected samples from each month november march inclusive fig 2c the variation in gross energy content between month and crop type was assessed using a two way analysis of variance considering both additive and interactive effects 2 7 swan assimilation efficiencies the mean sd assimilation efficiency i e the proportion of the gross energy ingested that can be extracted during the process of digestion and is thus available to be used by the forager i e metabolizability of swans feeding on root crops during winter was reported as 0 84 0 02 by nolet et al 2002 to our knowledge no studies have quantified assimilation efficiency for any swan species feeding on winter cereals therefore the mean sd proportional assimilation efficiency of swans feeding on winter cereals was taken to be 0 63 0 18 based on the metabolizability values reported for white fronted geese anser albifrons another grazing anseriform species feeding on winter wheat amano et al 2004 we multiplied the gross energy values for each resource type by the proportional assimilation efficiency to yield the net energy available to swans fig 2d we assessed the variation in net energy content between month and crop type using a two way analysis of variance as above there is currently limited evidence for temporal changes in resource specific assimilation efficiency among avian herbivores a study by van gils et al 2008 found that both gut length and assimilation efficiency of bewick s swans feeding on pasture grasses increased over winter however badzinski et al 2011 found no difference between spring and autumn gizzard mass among whistling swans cygnus columbianus currently no studies have examined seasonal changes in assimilation efficiency for either of our study species feeding on cereals or root crops hence we lack the data to consider further changes in assimilation efficiency between months 2 8 swan foraging effort and energy expenditure to estimate the foraging effort i e the proportion of time spent engaged in foraging behaviour and the total energy expenditure of swans we carried out behavioural observations on 714 swans on cereal and root fields during daylight in winters 2015 16 2016 17 and 2017 18 fig 2e f we used the focal observation method of altmann 1974 with swan behaviours during 1 0 20 2 minute observation periods mean sd 9 3 4 4 min assigned to the behavioural categories reported by nolet et al 2002 focal behavioural studies of swans typically use short observation periods as this approach allows a greater number of individuals to be sampled and so the results better reflect the behaviour of the population for example the mean sampling duration of previous focal studies of swans has ranged from 3 meissner and ciopcińska 2007 to 20 min keane and o halloran 1992 with most studies using a duration of around 10 min e g o hare et al 2007 tatu et al 2007 hence our approach is comparable to earlier studies in total the numbers of bewick s swans observed were 194 on cereals and 94 on roots while for whooper swans 204 were observed on cereals and 222 on roots it was not always possible to film both swan species using both crop types in all months accordingly bewick s swans were assumed to have the same foraging effort on cereals in march as in february and on roots in january and march as in february whilst whooper swans feeding on root crops in march were assumed to show the same foraging effort as in february the implications of variation in the foraging effort parameter were explored in a sensitivity analysis see section 2 11 for each swan species we assessed the variation in the square root transformed percentage time spent foraging between month and crop type using a two way analysis of variance the months for which data were missing were not included in this analysis next we used the behaviour specific energy costs w for bewick s swans measured experimentally by nolet et al 2002 to calculate the multipliers of basal metabolic rate xbmr for each behaviour next we used these bmr multipliers to estimate energetic costs of each behaviour for both species of swans based on their calculated bmr values hughes and green 2005 6 bmr z m 0 73 where z represents the bmr value at 1 kg body mass reported as 4 64 for anseriformes by zar 1968 and m was the body mass of the swan in kilograms based on the values given in eq 1 above the total energy expenditure of each individual could then be estimated as the sum of the energy expenditure spent on each behaviour and hence the mean sd energy expenditure for each swan species on each crop type could be estimated table 1 2 9 mechanistic resource model simulations and validation based on the parameter values derived above we modelled the instantaneous net rate of energy gain egain inst that can be achieved by each species whilst foraging on a given resource as 7 egain inst id q a ecost inst where id was the intake rate for a given resource biomass quantity i e cereal height in cm or root biomass g dm m 2 q was the energy content i e energy density j dm g 1 of the resource a was the forager s proportional assimilation efficiency for a given resource and ecost inst was the instantaneous energetic cost w incurred by the forager to estimate the mean 95 ci net rate of energy gain for each resource type in each month we used monte carlo simulations with 10 000 permutations using r r development core team 2018 where all parameters in each species specific model were drawn from a normal distribution with the mean and standard deviation as derived in the previous sections crowley 1992 a normal distribution was selected after klaassen et al 2010 using the msm package jackson 2011 values for cereal sward height root biomass density energy content and the functional response parameters attack rate and handling time were truncated with a lower bound of 0 to prevent negative values and with no upper bound assimilation efficiency was truncated between 0 and 1 as these are the minimum and maximum values that are biologically possible respectively our simulated estimates of energy gain were ordered numerically and the lower and upper 95 cis were taken as the 250th and 9750th simulations respectively model validation was based on whether the model could predict monthly trends in mean net energy gain that were consistent with the observed patterns of resource use i e progressive declines and increases in the use of root and cereal crops respectively with greater use of root crops in november and december and greater use of cereal crops in january february and march fig 1 the daily net rate of energy gain egain day that could be achieved whilst using a given resource in each month was modelled as 8 egain day id q a dl df ecost inst dl ecost night inst dt dl where dt was the total day length 86400 s and df was the proportion of daylight that swans spend feeding wwt unpublished data whilst dl was the mean number of seconds comprising daylight based on the daily timings of sunrise and sunset during winter 2016 17 for our study area usno 2018 2 10 estimating resource profitability we used our model simulations to assess the most profitable crop types for both the instantaneous and daily net rates of energy gain separately for each of our unordered 10 000 model simulations we compared whether the root or cereal crops yielded the highest net rate of energy gain we considered the crop type that offered the highest net rate of energy gain in each simulation to be the most profitable crop type for each swan species in each month we compared the proportions of the 10 000 model simulations for which i root crops were most profitable and ii cereal crops were most profitable using a two sample binomial test for equality of proportions crawley 2013 to account for multiple comparisons we adjusted all p values using holm bonferroni corrections holm 1979 and attributed statistically significant results where p 0 05 we estimated the 95 confidence interval associated with each proportion using an exact binomial test crawley 2013 we thus estimated the mean 95 ci probability that each crop would be the most profitable food resource for each swan species in each month at both the instantaneous and daily timescales 2 11 sensitivity analysis we used the individual parameter perturbation method i e the one at a time approach hamby 1994 to assess the sensitivity of the model predictions of instantaneous net energy gain to variation in the following parameter values i intake rate ii food quantity i e root biomass and cereal height iii food quality i e energy content iv assimilation efficiency and v forager energy expenditure for each parameter in turn we ran simulations using i mean sd ii mean and iii mean sd values for the parameter of interest whilst simultaneously holding all other parameters at their mean values 2 12 the influence of temporal changes in resource quantity and quality on profitability parsimony is a key principle that guides the building and testing of ecological models as parsimonious models make fewer assumptions and require less information to parameterise mulligan and wainwright 2004 a robustness analysis assesses whether models built using different information in terms of the parameters and their values give the same predictions i e whether predictions are robust to variations in model parameterisation levins 1966 grimm and berger 2016 robustness analyses can be useful tools to identify the minimum information required to parameterise a model before predictive accuracy is reduced i e the most parsimonious model specifically whilst we know that our model parameter values each have variance associated with them it may not be necessary to collect and include data on the variance in all parameters in order to achieve accurate model predictions that match real world swan resource selection we performed a robustness analysis to assess the relative influences of observed seasonal variations in key parameter values on swan resource selection first we ran simulations sequentially using all 4 combinations of our instantaneous net energy gain models with fixed or varying values for i resource biomass densities and ii resource energetic quality i e energy content and compared their predictions fixed values were the mean sd values of the mean of each month i e 2 parameter values whilst variable values were the mean sd monthly values as described above i e 10 parameter values next we compared the ability of each model to predict accurate monthly trends in net energy gain that were consistent with the observed long term pattern of resource use between winters 1976 77 and 2016 17 with greater use of root crops in november and december and greater use of cereal crops in january february and march fig 1 the most parsimonious model was the one that required the fewest parameter values to make accurate predictions whilst we only had model parameter values for winter 2016 17 wood et al 2019 found that the relative use of root and cereal crops did not change over the 1976 77 2016 17 study period which suggests that the relative changes in profitability are consistent between winters 3 results 3 1 model data for our study area we found that the mean sd cereal sward height increased over winter from 2 1 1 3 cm in november to 12 6 6 5 cm in march fig 2a a one way anova indicated that cereal height varied significantly with month f 4 111 39 11 p 0 001 r2 58 5 with march values greater than those for all other months and values for february significantly greater than those for november fig 2a in contrast root crop dry matter biomass declined progressively over winter from 68 2 95 4 g dm m 2 in november to 4 6 6 9 g dm m 2 in march fig 2b a one way anova indicated that root biomass varied significantly with month f 4 30 3 19 p 0 027 r2 29 9 with biomass values in november higher than those for either february or march fig 2b the mean sd gross energy content of cereal crops varied from 16 572 174 j g 1 dm in november to 15 886 237 j g 1 dm in february while root crop energy content varied from 15 138 125 j g 1 dm in november to 14 702 567 j g 1 dm in february fig 2c a two way anova indicated that gross energy content varied significantly with crop type but not month f 9 65 18 32 p 0 001 r2 adj 67 8 with cereal gross energy content significantly higher than root gross energy content in all months but with no between month differences within either crop type fig 2c given the assimilation efficiencies for each crop type the mean sd net energy content of cereal crops varied from 10 440 174 j g 1 dm in november to 10 123 210 j g 1 dm in february while root crop energy content varied from 12 716 105 j g 1 dm in november to 12 349 539 j g 1 dm in february fig 2d a two way anova indicated that net energy content varied significantly with crop type but not month f 9 65 92 57 p 0 001 r2 adj 91 8 with root net energy content significantly higher than cereal net energy content in all months but with no between month differences within either crop type fig 2d the mean sd proportion of daylight time spent by bewick s swans foraging on cereals varied from 0 184 0 203 in november to 0 563 0 222 in february and for root crops from 0 460 0 233 in november to 0 635 0 273 in january march fig 2e bewick s swan foraging effort differed significantly between month and crop type f 6 281 20 88 p 0 001 r2 adj 29 4 with foraging effort on cereal crops in november significantly lower than for all other months for both cereals and roots including root crops in november furthermore foraging effort on cereals in december was lower than on cereals in either january or february and lower than on root crops in february fig 2e similarly whooper swans foraging effort on cereals ranged from 0 433 0 248 in january to 0 546 0 236 in february and between 0 415 0 228 in december and 0 715 0 182 in february for root crops fig 2f whooper swan foraging effort also differed significantly between month and crop type f 8 337 28 05 p 0 001 r2 adj 38 6 in particular foraging effort on roots in december was significantly lower relative to roots in november and february with the february values being further greater than those in november fig 2f 3 2 estimating instantaneous rates of net energy gain for bewick s swans using cereal crops the mean estimated instantaneous rate of net energy gain increased substantially over winter from 49 4 w 95 ci 26 3 204 0 w in november to 199 3 w 95 ci 12 6 743 8 w in march fig 3 a concurrently the estimated rates of net energy gain that could be achieved on root crops declined from 598 7 w 95 ci 13 5 1998 5 w in november to 12 1 w 95 ci 34 5 113 6 w in march fig 3a the temporal trends in expected rates of energy gain for whooper swans showed the same pattern with net gains when feeding on cereal crops rising from 68 5 w 95 ci 40 3 290 0 w in november to 280 4 w 95 ci 19 9 1068 6 w in march whilst net gains when on root crops fell from 846 8 w 95 ci 14 9 2924 0 w in november to 19 6 w 95 ci 46 3 155 1 w in march fig 3b for both swan species the timing of the switch from root to cereal crops offering the highest instantaneous rates of net energy gain occurred between december and january 3 3 estimating daily rates of net energy gain our model outputs showed a rise in the mean daily net rate of energy gain that bewick s swans could achieve whilst feeding on cereal crops from 1 58 mj 95 ci 3 33 0 51 mj in november to 3 16 mj 95 ci 2 31 18 02 mj in march fig 4 a in contrast the daily rates of net energy gain that could be achieved on root crops declined from 6 85 mj 95 ci 2 53 32 41 mj in november to 1 39 mj 95 ci 3 27 1 46 mj in march fig 4a the estimates of mean daily rates of net energy gain for whooper swans exhibited the same temporal pattern with daily net gains for cereals increasing from 1 57 mj 95 ci 4 57 3 04 mj in november to 2 94 95 ci 3 54 19 77 mj in march whilst net gains for root crops fell from 12 66 mj 95 ci 3 17 54 52 mj in november to 1 42 mj 95 ci 4 32 3 41 mj in march fig 4b for both bewick s and whooper swans the switch from root to cereal crops offering the highest daily rates of net energy gain also occurred between december and january 3 4 estimating resource profitability within each month the proportions of simulations for which root or cereal crops were estimated by our instantaneous net energy gain models to be the most profitable differed significantly for both swan species table 2 in addition to these within month differences we also observed differences between months root crops were typically the most profitable resource in november and december whilst cereal crops most frequently had the highest profitability in january february and march fig 5 these instantaneous energy gain models indicated no significant differences between the two swan species table 3 our models of daily net energy gain also showed the same temporal patterns for both species of swans table 2 fig 5 however our daily energy gain models suggested significant differences between bewick s and whooper swans in the monthly proportions of simulations for which cereals and root crops were most profitable for all months except november and january table 3 the proportion of simulations for which cereal crops were most profitable was higher for whooper swans than bewick s swans in december and higher for bewick s swans than whooper swans in february and march with the opposite pattern for root crops table 3 3 5 sensitivity analysis for both bewick s and whooper swans the instantaneous net rates of energy gain predicted by the deterministic versions of our models were most sensitive to the variance associated with the intake rate and food quantity parameters appendix a model predictions showed lower levels of sensitivity to the variance in the other parameters for example adjusting the value of the cereal height parameter from the mean value to the mean sd value altered the net rate of energy gain predicted for a bewick s swan feeding on cereal crops in november from 49 2 w to 83 6 w in contrast adjusting the cereal energy content parameter value from the mean to the mean sd value increased the net rate of energy gain from 49 2 w to only 50 0 w appendix a the predictions of the daily net energy gain models also showed the greatest relative sensitivity to the variance associated with the intake rate and food quantity parameters however the predictions of these models also showed sensitivity to the variance in foraging effort in some months in particular november for root crops and march for cereal crops 3 6 the influence of temporal changes in resource quantity and quality on profitability of our four competing models for each species only models that included monthly variation in resource quantity i e cereal height and root biomass density predicted correctly the most profitable resource type in each month as well as the timing of the switch in relative profitability table 4 figs 6 and 7 in contrast models that used fixed mean winter values for resource quality i e energy content were capable of accurate predictions only if monthly variation in resource quantity was included table 4 figs 6 and 7 4 discussion our study shows that comparing model based estimates of the rates of net energy gain for different food resources can facilitate understanding of animal resource selection and use within landscapes in accordance with our first hypothesis we found that the patterns in expected net energy gains and resource profitability showed the same temporal patterns as observed resource use by overwintering swans our mechanistic model showed that swans could achieve the greatest rates of net energy gain on root crops in early winter and on cereal crops in late winter taking into account the variance associated with key parameters we found that root and cereal crops were typically the most energetically profitable in early and late winter respectively the switch between root crops and cereal crops offering the greatest net rates of energy gain was predicted to occur at the same time as the birds were observed to switch from using predominantly root crops to predominantly cereal crops between december and january wood et al 2019 the agreement between our model based estimates of energy gain and the observed shifts in resource use among overwintering swans suggests that maximising net rates of energy gain is an important resource selection strategy for these birds during winter the temporal pattern of resource profitability was the same for both swan species with root crops most likely to be the most profitable in early winter and cereals most likely to be the most profitable in late winter however the daily energy gain models indicated some differences between bewick s and whooper swans in the precise likelihood of root or cereal crops being the most profitable resource type in a given month the between species differences in daily profitability were likely due to interspecific differences in the foraging effort of each species defined as the amount of time spent engaged in foraging behaviour as the species for which a resource type was more likely to be the most profitable also typically showed the greatest foraging effort on this resource type fig 2 accordingly no such between species differences were detected for the instantaneous energy gain models which did not include the foraging effort variable our model based estimates of bewick s swan energy gain on arable crops of up to 600 w were similar to previous estimates of bewick s swan energy gain when feeding on aquatic plant tubers in early winter nolet and klaassen 2009 gyimesi et al 2012a b in comparison whooper swan energetics has received less attention from researchers the high net rates of energy gain in early winter would help swans to replace the energy expended during their autumn migration to the winter grounds beekman et al 2002 furthermore our model outputs showed clear seasonal trends in rates of both net energy gain and profitability both the maximum predicted instantaneous and daily energy gains decline from early to mid winter which may reflect a change in the birds behavioural strategies from rapid refuelling in early winter to maintaining energy reserves during mid winter swan foraging effort was not observed to exceed 71 of daylight hours mean 51 which is lower than the foraging effort of 80 100 of daylight hours reported for other wintering populations of avian herbivores e g cope 2003 suggesting that our focal swans had the capacity to increase their foraging effort in order to increase their daily energy gain future comparisons of the variation in foraging effort amongst avian herbivore species using different food resources would help to improve our understanding of the capacity of birds to adjust foraging intensity and the role that this may play in the selection of food resources in each winter month one of the two resources was more likely to be more profitable than the other with root crops most likely to be the most profitable in early winter and cereals most likely to be the most profitable in late winter yet for both our instantaneous and daily energy gain models the confidence intervals associated with root and cereal crops had some overlap indicating that for example a high quality cereal field in early winter could allow a higher rate of energy gain than a poor quality root crop field in early winter despite the overall higher mean profitability of root crops in early winter crucially the upper confidence limits also suggested that swans could maintain a positive energy balance on either resource throughout winter if selecting those areas that allow higher rates of net energy gain in accordance with field data that shows that swans routinely use both habitats throughout winter rees et al 1997 wood et al 2019 fig 1 whilst foragers would typically be expected to prefer fields of the resource type predicted to be the most likely to be profitable this resource might not be used in practice if those fields are of poor quality i e fields that only permit energy gain at the lower end of the confidence interval have unsuitable characteristics or are subject to disturbance rees et al 2005 avian herbivores such as swans are highly mobile and may travel up to 20 km from their nocturnal roost sites to their diurnal feeding areas newton et al 1973 such mobility would allow individuals to assess over large areas the variability in the parameters that determine energy gain and to select the feeding sites within such areas that have values that would allow them to maximize their rates of net energy gain avian herbivores are known to select roots and tubers buried at sediment depths that allow them to maximize energy intake rates e g chen et al 2019 for example experimental evidence shows that avian herbivores prefer sward heights which enable them to achieve higher intake rates and thus higher rates of energy gain jacobsen 1992 hassall et al 2001 similarly previous research has suggested that avian herbivores can use visual cues such as how green vegetation is to assess the relative profitability of that food resource owen 1976 as well as searching strategies to locate profitable feeding patches nolet and mooij 2002 lascala gruenewald et al 2019 in accordance with our second hypothesis our results suggested that the temporal increase in cereal height and decrease in root biomass over the course of winter drove the changes in the rates of net energy gain which in turn drove the switch in resource use autumn and winter sown cereals such as wheat increase their height and hence the biomass available to foragers over winter whilst the biomass of post harvest remains of spring sown root crops declines due to decay and depletion by foragers gill et al 1996 draycott 2006 this study in contrast we found relative small changes in the energy content of cereals and root crops during winter which accordingly had little influence on the shift in resource use compared with the larger changes in food quantity however previous research has found that examining trends in food quantity alone could not explain switches in resource use by avian herbivores e g mckay et al 1994 therefore we believe that a mechanistic modelling approach facilitates a more comprehensive evaluation of the variables that may affect resource use compared with independent assessments of trends in these variables furthermore the data used to parameterise mechanistic models cost time money and other resources to collect so increased investment in data collection for one parameter is likely to result in less effort available for quantifying another parameter the findings of our robustness analysis thus have implications for future model development in addition to providing ecological insights into the variables that drive shifts in resource use by avian herbivores our simulation results suggest that future mechanistic models of avian herbivores in arable habitats should prioritise obtaining accurate data on temporal changes in the quantity of food available over the energetic quality of that food as the temporal variations in food quantity have a disproportionately large effect on model predictions of net energy gain and relative profitability using behavioural ecology to understand the mechanisms by which animals select food resources within a landscape offers the possibility of using this knowledge to improve our ability to predict and manage animals use of feeding areas as well as their impacts on economically valuable food resources sutherland 1998 wood et al 2014 berger tal and saltz 2016 as such understanding where and when avian herbivores will use food resources has clear application for environmental decision makers such insights could inform the conservation management of key feeding areas for species of conservation concern such as the bewick s swan nagy et al 2012 from our results it is clear that overwintering swans would benefit from the continued provision of both crop types throughout winter and in particular the availability of fields of root crops in early winter and cereal crops in late winter such insights can also inform the deployment of crop protection strategies to alleviate agricultural damage associated with overwintering swans laubek 1995 colhoun and day 2002 for example land managers could designate fields of high net energy gain as sacrificial feeding areas to prevent damage to surrounding crops owen 1977 wood et al 2014 the match between the predictions of swan energy gain by our mechanistic models and the observed pattern of resource use support the view that temporal patterns in swan energetics play a key role in shifts in winter resource use earlier research has also found that energy maximizing foraging strategies underpin observed shifts in feeding resources from aquatic plant tubers to root crops by bewick s swans in the netherlands nolet et al 2002 and from pasture grasses to aquatic plants by mute swans in the uk wood et al 2013 similarly amano et al 2004 found that an energy maximizing strategy caused white fronted geese to shift from feeding on rice to winter wheat while these studies together with our article provide compelling evidence that energy plays a major role in habitat selection by avian herbivores other variables such as nitrogen and other macronutrients could also have an influence future modelling which evaluates different foraging currencies would help to resolve this discussion improving our knowledge of animal decision making processes is a key step towards the development of models that can also predict animal resource use in space as well as time by considering changes in the distribution of food resources within the landscape further research should aim to forecast spatiotemporal patterns in forager resource interactions at the landscape scale and thus predict where wildlife impacts and the conflicts that arise from such impacts are most likely to occur for example the future development of spatially and temporally explicit individual based models wood et al 2015 could allow the inclusion of other factors known to influence the foraging of overwintering swans such as anthropogenic disturbance and both interference and depletion competition between foragers rees et al 2005 gyimesi et al 2012a chudzińska et al 2016 recent research has shown that avian herbivores track variable food resources within changing landscapes e g clausen et al 2018 therefore models based on mechanistic understanding of how animals select resources within a landscape will be increasingly valuable aids to decision making in the face of continued environmental change wood et al 2018 acknowledgements we

24994,our understanding of how energy shapes animal behavioural decisions has been limited by the difficulty of measuring directly the energy gain and expenditure in free living animals mechanistic models that simulate energy gain and expenditure from estimable parameters can overcome these limitations and hence could help scientists to gain a predictive understanding of animal behaviour such models could be used to test mechanistic explanations of observed patterns of resource use within a landscape such as behavioural decisions to switch among food resources here we developed mechanistic models of the instantaneous and daily rates of net energy gain for two species of migratory swans the bewick s swan cygnus columbianus bewickii and whooper swan cygnus cygnus that feed on root and cereal crops within an agricultural landscape in eastern england field data show that both species shift from using predominantly root crops e g sugar beet and potatoes in early winter to using mostly cereals e g wheat in late winter our models correspondingly predicted that swans could achieve the greatest rates of net energy gain on root crops in early winter and on cereal crops in late winter the change from root crops to cereal crops providing the greatest net rates of energy gain was predicted to occur at the same time as the birds switch from feeding predominantly on root crops to predominantly cereal crops between december and january we used monte carlo simulations to account for variance in model parameters on predictions of energy gain and profitability a sensitivity analysis indicated that predictions of net energy gain were most sensitive to variance in the intake rate and food quantity parameters the agreement between our model estimates of energy gain and the observed shifts in resource use observed among the overwintering swans suggests that maximising net rates of energy gain is an important resource selection strategy among overwintering birds a mechanistic understanding of where and when birds will use food resources can inform the conservation management of key feeding areas for species of conservation concern as well as the deployment of crop protection strategies keywords behavioural ecology energetics mechanistic models optimal foraging resource selection 1 introduction understanding why animals show temporal variation in their use

specific rates of net energy gain play a key role in animals selection of feeding resources nolet and klaassen 2009 babin et al 2011 wood et al 2013 however the net rates of energy gain that animals can achieve whilst feeding are not constant fluctuating with variations in the quantity and quality of the food available owen et al 1992 gates et al 2001 tinkler et al 2009 daniels et al 2019 the most profitable food resources for a foraging animal therefore will likely vary in space and time highly mobile animals including avian herbivores can move readily between different food resources within a landscape to track the most profitable resource drent and prins 1987 hence resource heterogeneity within a landscape can result in temporal shifts in resource use by foragers e g prins and ydenberg 1985 vickery et al 1995 mckay et al 1994 nolet et al 2002 inger et al 2006 wood et al 2013 agricultural landscapes can provide a range of energy rich food resources for herbivorous animals gordon 2009 in northwest europe overwintering bewick s swans cygnus columbianus bewickii and whooper swans cygnus cygnus feed predominantly on agricultural food resources such as cereals e g wheat triticum aestivum as well as the unharvested remains of root crops e g sugar beet beta vulgaris and potatoes solanum tuberosum dirksen et al 1991 rees et al 1997 wood et al 2019 root crops are preferred in early winter while cereal crops are preferred in late winter a pattern that has been consistent since the 1970s wood et al 2019 overwintering swans must select food resources that allow them to replace energy spent during their autumn migration and to gain the reserves required for their return flight and reproduction hence the selection of food resources by swans and other herbivorous capital breeders has important implications for subsequent survival and reproduction and hence fitness prop and black 1998 at high densities swans feeding on growing crops such as cereals can impact crop growth rates and yields laubek 1995 colhoun and day 2002 in contrast swans feeding on post harvest remains of root crops may benefit farmers as it delays the switch onto more valuable cereals gill 1996 yet despite the ecological and economic implications of swan use of agricultural habitats during winter the mechanisms that underpin the observed shifts between different arable resources such as root and cereal crops are not well understood accurately measuring rates of energy gain and loss in wild animals under field conditions is difficult hammond and diamond 1997 mechanistic models which simulate systems from their component parts connolly et al 2017 offer an alternative approach whereby rates of net energy gains can be simulated from measurable component parameters such as resource quantity and energetic quality as well as forager intake rates assimilation efficiency and energy expenditure bauer et al 2006 nolet and klaassen 2009 wood et al 2013 chudzińska et al 2016 whilst deterministic models have used mean parameter values to produce fixed estimates of energy gain e g wood et al 2013 in reality there will be variance associated with each mean parameter values due to both spatiotemporal variance and measurement error for example crop biomass will vary temporally as the crop grows and is harvested as well as spatially due to differences in factors such as soil nutrient concentrations and moisture content day and intalap 1970 carew et al 2009 chudzińska et al 2016 such variability could influence the relative profitability of different food resources and so needs to be taken into account when developing mechanistic foraging models valuable ecological insight can be gained from understanding how variations in some parameters have disproportionately large effects on rates of forager energy gain and hence resource selection indeed variance in some parameters will have relatively large effects on model predictions compared whilst variance in other parameters may have little effect on predictions and so may not need to be included in a model for example wood et al 2013 used a mechanistic foraging model to show that a seasonal switch by mute swans cygnus olor from terrestrial to aquatic foraging was instigated by declines in water velocity which reduced the energetic cost of aquatic foraging rather than changes in food biomass or energy content furthermore as the data used to parameterise models cost time money and other resources to collect no more data should be collected than necessary to build a model capable of producing accurate predictions and hence parsimony has long been a guiding principle in model development mulligan and wainwright 2004 therefore modellers need to use tools such as sensitivity and robustness analyses to identify the relative influence of parameters on model predictions and hence facilitate the development of parsimonious models levins 1966 grimm and berger 2016 in this study we constructed mechanistic models of swan energy gain and loss to examine the role of energetics in temporal patterns of resource selection by overwintering swans our first hypothesis was that the patterns in simulated net energy gains and resource profitability would show the same temporal patterns as observed swan resource use with a shift over winter from predominant use of root crops in early winter to a predominant use of cereal crops in late winter our second hypothesis was that variability in food quantity i e root biomass and cereal sward height would have a greater influence on seasonal changes in the simulated rates of energy gain compared with variation in food quality i e crop energy content as food quantity typically shows greater seasonal variability than food quality in arable systems e g mckay et al 1994 2 methods 2 1 study system the ouse washes 52 27 n 0 11 e and surrounding farmland is an internationally important site for both bewick s and whooper swans with the highest numbers occurring between november and february rees et al 1997 wood et al 2019 this extensive area of seasonally flooded wet grassland is used by the swans as a roost and both species fly to feed on agricultural crops grazing on growing cereals such as wheat and grubbing for post harvest remains of root crops such as sugar beet and potatoes on fields in the surrounding area during the day rees et al 1997 wood et al 2019 in early winter the swans feed predominantly on root crops before progressively switching to cereal crops rees et al 1997 wood et al 2019 the field measurements undertaken for our study were carried out during winter 2016 17 on a 15 4 km2 area of farmland comprising 1 8 km2 and 5 0 km2 of root and cereal crop fields respectively with the remaining area composed of other crops or fallow fields surrounding the ouse washes at southery fens 52 30 n 0 23 e a major feeding area approximately 7 5 km south east of the main roost site 2 2 swan resource use surveys to determine the relative use of different food resources co ordinated surveys of the areas of the ouse washes and surrounding fens used by swans were undertaken during daylight hours at monthly intervals from october to march inclusive between winters 1976 77 and 2016 2017 wood et al 2019 on encountering swans during the surveys the total number of individuals present and crop type were recorded to allow the total numbers and proportions of those totals using each crop type to be calculated further details of the survey methodology have been reported by wood et al 2019 in this study we grouped crops into the following categories autumn winter sown cereals e g wheat and post harvest remains of root crops e g sugar beet and potatoes alternative crops such as oilseed rape and pasture grasses were not considered further as together cereals and root crops account for 89 of the total number of swans observed wood et al 2019 fig 1 wood et al 2019 found that swans showed a within winter pattern of foraging that was consistent between the 1970s and 2010s whereby root crops were used predominantly in early winter november december and cereal crops were most used in late winter january march 2 3 overview of mechanistic modelling approach we developed mechanistic models to simulate predictions of swan net energy gain based on combinations of the following parameters i forager food intake rates ii food quantity root biomass and cereal height iii food quality energy content iv forager food assimilation efficiency v forager energy expenditure and vi foraging effort per day the instantaneous i e per second net energy gain was simulated from parameters i v whilst the net energy gain per 24 h day was simulated from parameters i vi see section 2 9 for both the instantaneous and daily models we used monte carlo simulations to account for variance in the model parameters our models made predictions of net energy gain on each resource type for each swan species and for each month in order to test our two hypotheses as such these predictions represent corroboratory predictions sensu maris et al 2018 in the following sections we describe the derivation of all model parameter values the structure of the models the monte carlo procedure the processes of model validation and the analyses of model sensitivity and robustness 2 4 food quantity to derive the values of cereal sward height required to estimate the swan s food intake rates we measured sward height in all 25 cereal fields within our study area each month between november 2016 and march 2017 inclusive we used the direct measurement method whereby a hand is placed lightly onto the vegetation to the level below which approximately 80 of the vegetation is estimated by eye to be growing then measuring this height 5 mm using a ruler stewart et al 2001 each month 10 sward height measurements were taken per field per visit to estimate the monthly mean average height for that field based on the sample sizes used by mckay et al 1994 who previously measured changes in winter cereal sward height between november and march in the uk randomised sampling was achieved by measuring at 10 sets of random number generated x y co ordinates based on field length and width to quantify the monthly cereal sward heights for our study area we calculated the mean average sd of the mean sward height values recorded for each field in each month fig 2 a between month variation in cereal height was assessed using a one way analysis of variance in r r development core team 2018 with month modelled as a categorical variable and post hoc differences between months were evaluated using tukey s hsd the model residuals were checked to ensure that test assumptions were met additionally in one cereal field that was representative of the study area in size and farming practices we harvested all aboveground cereal tissues within 0 00785 m2 areas n 20 to enable the determination of energy content see section 2 6 prior to analysis each sample was dried to constant mass at 60 c using a genlab pro 100 general purpose oven genlab usa we estimated the biomass of root crops available to the swans in each month from measurements in 6 sugar beet and 4 potato fields which represented all of the root crop fields within our study area as swans feed only on the post harvest remains of root crops rees et al 1997 wood et al 2019 our measurements began after the fields had been harvested in each month we excavated all post harvest remains of root crops within 1 m2 patches n 10 per field per month randomised sampling was achieved by excavating at 10 sets of random number generated x y co ordinates based on field length and width non crop material e g soil was removed from each sample with the fresh weight determined 0 1 g using a pesola pts3000 digital balance pesola präzisionswaagen ag switzerland each sample was dried to constant mass as described above before dry mass was measured the mean sd root crop dry matter biomass for a given month was then estimated based on all field specific mean values across all sugar beet and potato fields fig 2b between month variation in root biomass was assessed using a one way analysis of variance 2 5 swan intake rates the functional response describes the relationship between forager food intake rates and food density sensu holling 1959 many avian herbivores show type i or type ii functional responses whereby the food intake rate shows an increase with food density up to an asymptote and a decelerating increase with food density up to an asymptote respectively e g durant et al 2003 wood et al 2013 a type i functional response equation models intake rate based on the forager s rate of discovery of food items a measure of search efficiency termed attack rate whilst a type ii functional response equation models intake rate based on the attack rate and the time required to capture and ingest food items termed handling time holling 1959 to model the intake rate of swans feeding on cereals we used the mean sd parameters attack rate and handling time of the type ii functional response curve reported by durant et al 2003 for greylag geese anser anser another grazing anseriform species foraging on pasture grass which we scaled to our swan species we are not aware of any published functional response studies for waterfowl feeding on growing cereals however accurate estimates of intake rate can be obtained from allometric scaling because earlier meta analyses of ducks geese and swans have demonstrated that the food intake rate of herbivorous waterfowl is strongly related to species body mass r2 72 wood et al 2012 see also van gils et al 2007 the original equation reported by durant et al 2003 was expressed in mg dry matter hereafter dm min 1 which we converted to g dm s 1 to match the scale of the other parameters in our models the intake rate was scaled for our swan species from the original greylag goose values following the approach of baveco et al 2011 whereby the equation is adjusted for body mass with a mass exponent of 0 71 van gils et al 2007 therefore we modelled the intake rate ic g dm s 1 for swans feeding on cereal crops as 1 ic a hmonth 1 b hmonth 1 000 60 ms mg 0 71 where the hmonth was the mean sd sward height in cm for a given month mg was the mean body mass of a greylag goose 3270 g matthews and campbell 1969 ms was the mean body mass of the foraging swan species 6000 g and 9700 g for a bewick s and whooper swan respectively kear 2005 the mean sd values of the attack rate a and handling time b were 173 94 cm2 s 1 and 0 12 0 12 s g 1 respectively durant et al 2003 we modified the functional response for swans foraging on root crops from that given for bewick s swans feeding on root crops by baveco et al 2011 2 ir a dr where ir was the intake rate g dm s 1 a was the attack rate and dr was the root crop dry matter biomass density g dm m 2 to estimate the attack rate a for our study system we first converted the energy intake rate ie for swans feeding on sugar beet in early winter of approximately 462 j s 1 reported by baveco et al 2011 to a food intake rate expressed in g dm s 1 ir based on the dry matter energy content of root crops er sampled in early winter 2016 17 during our study of 15 138 j dm g 1 as follows 3 ir ie er the early winter value was used for consistency with the methodology of baveco et al 2011 we rearranged the functional response formula of baveco et al 2011 as 4 a ir dr which for our early winter root crop biomass density of 68 2 g dm m 2 gave an estimated mean attack rate a of 0 00045 m2 s 1 in the absence of published estimates we assumed that the standard deviation of the root crop attack rate would be a fixed proportion of the mean equivalent to the mean and standard deviation of the cereal crop attack rate 94 173 0 54 as attack rate in both cases is governed by the same biomechanical processes which yielded a standard deviation for the root crop attack rate of 0 00024 m2 s 1 this bewick s swan attack rate was scaled for whooper swans following the approach of baveco et al 2011 whereby the equation is adjusted for body mass with a mass exponent of 0 71 van gils et al 2007 therefore we modelled the intake rate g dm s 1 for swans feeding on root crops in our study system as 5 ir 0 00045 0 00027 ms mb 0 71 dr where mb was the body mass of a bewick s swan and ms was the body mass of the foraging swan species as given in eq 1 above 2 6 food energy content to determine the energy content j g 1 dm of each food resource 500 1 mg dm of each food resource sample cereal or root crop collected during field sampling see section 2 4 was analysed via bomb calorimetry using a parr 1108 oxygen combustion bomb parr instrument company illinois usa to yield a mean sd estimate for each food resource we analysed 5 randomly selected samples from each month november march inclusive fig 2c the variation in gross energy content between month and crop type was assessed using a two way analysis of variance considering both additive and interactive effects 2 7 swan assimilation efficiencies the mean sd assimilation efficiency i e the proportion of the gross energy ingested that can be extracted during the process of digestion and is thus available to be used by the forager i e metabolizability of swans feeding on root crops during winter was reported as 0 84 0 02 by nolet et al 2002 to our knowledge no studies have quantified assimilation efficiency for any swan species feeding on winter cereals therefore the mean sd proportional assimilation efficiency of swans feeding on winter cereals was taken to be 0 63 0 18 based on the metabolizability values reported for white fronted geese anser albifrons another grazing anseriform species feeding on winter wheat amano et al 2004 we multiplied the gross energy values for each resource type by the proportional assimilation efficiency to yield the net energy available to swans fig 2d we assessed the variation in net energy content between month and crop type using a two way analysis of variance as above there is currently limited evidence for temporal changes in resource specific assimilation efficiency among avian herbivores a study by van gils et al 2008 found that both gut length and assimilation efficiency of bewick s swans feeding on pasture grasses increased over winter however badzinski et al 2011 found no difference between spring and autumn gizzard mass among whistling swans cygnus columbianus currently no studies have examined seasonal changes in assimilation efficiency for either of our study species feeding on cereals or root crops hence we lack the data to consider further changes in assimilation efficiency between months 2 8 swan foraging effort and energy expenditure to estimate the foraging effort i e the proportion of time spent engaged in foraging behaviour and the total energy expenditure of swans we carried out behavioural observations on 714 swans on cereal and root fields during daylight in winters 2015 16 2016 17 and 2017 18 fig 2e f we used the focal observation method of altmann 1974 with swan behaviours during 1 0 20 2 minute observation periods mean sd 9 3 4 4 min assigned to the behavioural categories reported by nolet et al 2002 focal behavioural studies of swans typically use short observation periods as this approach allows a greater number of individuals to be sampled and so the results better reflect the behaviour of the population for example the mean sampling duration of previous focal studies of swans has ranged from 3 meissner and ciopcińska 2007 to 20 min keane and o halloran 1992 with most studies using a duration of around 10 min e g o hare et al 2007 tatu et al 2007 hence our approach is comparable to earlier studies in total the numbers of bewick s swans observed were 194 on cereals and 94 on roots while for whooper swans 204 were observed on cereals and 222 on roots it was not always possible to film both swan species using both crop types in all months accordingly bewick s swans were assumed to have the same foraging effort on cereals in march as in february and on roots in january and march as in february whilst whooper swans feeding on root crops in march were assumed to show the same foraging effort as in february the implications of variation in the foraging effort parameter were explored in a sensitivity analysis see section 2 11 for each swan species we assessed the variation in the square root transformed percentage time spent foraging between month and crop type using a two way analysis of variance the months for which data were missing were not included in this analysis next we used the behaviour specific energy costs w for bewick s swans measured experimentally by nolet et al 2002 to calculate the multipliers of basal metabolic rate xbmr for each behaviour next we used these bmr multipliers to estimate energetic costs of each behaviour for both species of swans based on their calculated bmr values hughes and green 2005 6 bmr z m 0 73 where z represents the bmr value at 1 kg body mass reported as 4 64 for anseriformes by zar 1968 and m was the body mass of the swan in kilograms based on the values given in eq 1 above the total energy expenditure of each individual could then be estimated as the sum of the energy expenditure spent on each behaviour and hence the mean sd energy expenditure for each swan species on each crop type could be estimated table 1 2 9 mechanistic resource model simulations and validation based on the parameter values derived above we modelled the instantaneous net rate of energy gain egain inst that can be achieved by each species whilst foraging on a given resource as 7 egain inst id q a ecost inst where id was the intake rate for a given resource biomass quantity i e cereal height in cm or root biomass g dm m 2 q was the energy content i e energy density j dm g 1 of the resource a was the forager s proportional assimilation efficiency for a given resource and ecost inst was the instantaneous energetic cost w incurred by the forager to estimate the mean 95 ci net rate of energy gain for each resource type in each month we used monte carlo simulations with 10 000 permutations using r r development core team 2018 where all parameters in each species specific model were drawn from a normal distribution with the mean and standard deviation as derived in the previous sections crowley 1992 a normal distribution was selected after klaassen et al 2010 using the msm package jackson 2011 values for cereal sward height root biomass density energy content and the functional response parameters attack rate and handling time were truncated with a lower bound of 0 to prevent negative values and with no upper bound assimilation efficiency was truncated between 0 and 1 as these are the minimum and maximum values that are biologically possible respectively our simulated estimates of energy gain were ordered numerically and the lower and upper 95 cis were taken as the 250th and 9750th simulations respectively model validation was based on whether the model could predict monthly trends in mean net energy gain that were consistent with the observed patterns of resource use i e progressive declines and increases in the use of root and cereal crops respectively with greater use of root crops in november and december and greater use of cereal crops in january february and march fig 1 the daily net rate of energy gain egain day that could be achieved whilst using a given resource in each month was modelled as 8 egain day id q a dl df ecost inst dl ecost night inst dt dl where dt was the total day length 86400 s and df was the proportion of daylight that swans spend feeding wwt unpublished data whilst dl was the mean number of seconds comprising daylight based on the daily timings of sunrise and sunset during winter 2016 17 for our study area usno 2018 2 10 estimating resource profitability we used our model simulations to assess the most profitable crop types for both the instantaneous and daily net rates of energy gain separately for each of our unordered 10 000 model simulations we compared whether the root or cereal crops yielded the highest net rate of energy gain we considered the crop type that offered the highest net rate of energy gain in each simulation to be the most profitable crop type for each swan species in each month we compared the proportions of the 10 000 model simulations for which i root crops were most profitable and ii cereal crops were most profitable using a two sample binomial test for equality of proportions crawley 2013 to account for multiple comparisons we adjusted all p values using holm bonferroni corrections holm 1979 and attributed statistically significant results where p 0 05 we estimated the 95 confidence interval associated with each proportion using an exact binomial test crawley 2013 we thus estimated the mean 95 ci probability that each crop would be the most profitable food resource for each swan species in each month at both the instantaneous and daily timescales 2 11 sensitivity analysis we used the individual parameter perturbation method i e the one at a time approach hamby 1994 to assess the sensitivity of the model predictions of instantaneous net energy gain to variation in the following parameter values i intake rate ii food quantity i e root biomass and cereal height iii food quality i e energy content iv assimilation efficiency and v forager energy expenditure for each parameter in turn we ran simulations using i mean sd ii mean and iii mean sd values for the parameter of interest whilst simultaneously holding all other parameters at their mean values 2 12 the influence of temporal changes in resource quantity and quality on profitability parsimony is a key principle that guides the building and testing of ecological models as parsimonious models make fewer assumptions and require less information to parameterise mulligan and wainwright 2004 a robustness analysis assesses whether models built using different information in terms of the parameters and their values give the same predictions i e whether predictions are robust to variations in model parameterisation levins 1966 grimm and berger 2016 robustness analyses can be useful tools to identify the minimum information required to parameterise a model before predictive accuracy is reduced i e the most parsimonious model specifically whilst we know that our model parameter values each have variance associated with them it may not be necessary to collect and include data on the variance in all parameters in order to achieve accurate model predictions that match real world swan resource selection we performed a robustness analysis to assess the relative influences of observed seasonal variations in key parameter values on swan resource selection first we ran simulations sequentially using all 4 combinations of our instantaneous net energy gain models with fixed or varying values for i resource biomass densities and ii resource energetic quality i e energy content and compared their predictions fixed values were the mean sd values of the mean of each month i e 2 parameter values whilst variable values were the mean sd monthly values as described above i e 10 parameter values next we compared the ability of each model to predict accurate monthly trends in net energy gain that were consistent with the observed long term pattern of resource use between winters 1976 77 and 2016 17 with greater use of root crops in november and december and greater use of cereal crops in january february and march fig 1 the most parsimonious model was the one that required the fewest parameter values to make accurate predictions whilst we only had model parameter values for winter 2016 17 wood et al 2019 found that the relative use of root and cereal crops did not change over the 1976 77 2016 17 study period which suggests that the relative changes in profitability are consistent between winters 3 results 3 1 model data for our study area we found that the mean sd cereal sward height increased over winter from 2 1 1 3 cm in november to 12 6 6 5 cm in march fig 2a a one way anova indicated that cereal height varied significantly with month f 4 111 39 11 p 0 001 r2 58 5 with march values greater than those for all other months and values for february significantly greater than those for november fig 2a in contrast root crop dry matter biomass declined progressively over winter from 68 2 95 4 g dm m 2 in november to 4 6 6 9 g dm m 2 in march fig 2b a one way anova indicated that root biomass varied significantly with month f 4 30 3 19 p 0 027 r2 29 9 with biomass values in november higher than those for either february or march fig 2b the mean sd gross energy content of cereal crops varied from 16 572 174 j g 1 dm in november to 15 886 237 j g 1 dm in february while root crop energy content varied from 15 138 125 j g 1 dm in november to 14 702 567 j g 1 dm in february fig 2c a two way anova indicated that gross energy content varied significantly with crop type but not month f 9 65 18 32 p 0 001 r2 adj 67 8 with cereal gross energy content significantly higher than root gross energy content in all months but with no between month differences within either crop type fig 2c given the assimilation efficiencies for each crop type the mean sd net energy content of cereal crops varied from 10 440 174 j g 1 dm in november to 10 123 210 j g 1 dm in february while root crop energy content varied from 12 716 105 j g 1 dm in november to 12 349 539 j g 1 dm in february fig 2d a two way anova indicated that net energy content varied significantly with crop type but not month f 9 65 92 57 p 0 001 r2 adj 91 8 with root net energy content significantly higher than cereal net energy content in all months but with no between month differences within either crop type fig 2d the mean sd proportion of daylight time spent by bewick s swans foraging on cereals varied from 0 184 0 203 in november to 0 563 0 222 in february and for root crops from 0 460 0 233 in november to 0 635 0 273 in january march fig 2e bewick s swan foraging effort differed significantly between month and crop type f 6 281 20 88 p 0 001 r2 adj 29 4 with foraging effort on cereal crops in november significantly lower than for all other months for both cereals and roots including root crops in november furthermore foraging effort on cereals in december was lower than on cereals in either january or february and lower than on root crops in february fig 2e similarly whooper swans foraging effort on cereals ranged from 0 433 0 248 in january to 0 546 0 236 in february and between 0 415 0 228 in december and 0 715 0 182 in february for root crops fig 2f whooper swan foraging effort also differed significantly between month and crop type f 8 337 28 05 p 0 001 r2 adj 38 6 in particular foraging effort on roots in december was significantly lower relative to roots in november and february with the february values being further greater than those in november fig 2f 3 2 estimating instantaneous rates of net energy gain for bewick s swans using cereal crops the mean estimated instantaneous rate of net energy gain increased substantially over winter from 49 4 w 95 ci 26 3 204 0 w in november to 199 3 w 95 ci 12 6 743 8 w in march fig 3 a concurrently the estimated rates of net energy gain that could be achieved on root crops declined from 598 7 w 95 ci 13 5 1998 5 w in november to 12 1 w 95 ci 34 5 113 6 w in march fig 3a the temporal trends in expected rates of energy gain for whooper swans showed the same pattern with net gains when feeding on cereal crops rising from 68 5 w 95 ci 40 3 290 0 w in november to 280 4 w 95 ci 19 9 1068 6 w in march whilst net gains when on root crops fell from 846 8 w 95 ci 14 9 2924 0 w in november to 19 6 w 95 ci 46 3 155 1 w in march fig 3b for both swan species the timing of the switch from root to cereal crops offering the highest instantaneous rates of net energy gain occurred between december and january 3 3 estimating daily rates of net energy gain our model outputs showed a rise in the mean daily net rate of energy gain that bewick s swans could achieve whilst feeding on cereal crops from 1 58 mj 95 ci 3 33 0 51 mj in november to 3 16 mj 95 ci 2 31 18 02 mj in march fig 4 a in contrast the daily rates of net energy gain that could be achieved on root crops declined from 6 85 mj 95 ci 2 53 32 41 mj in november to 1 39 mj 95 ci 3 27 1 46 mj in march fig 4a the estimates of mean daily rates of net energy gain for whooper swans exhibited the same temporal pattern with daily net gains for cereals increasing from 1 57 mj 95 ci 4 57 3 04 mj in november to 2 94 95 ci 3 54 19 77 mj in march whilst net gains for root crops fell from 12 66 mj 95 ci 3 17 54 52 mj in november to 1 42 mj 95 ci 4 32 3 41 mj in march fig 4b for both bewick s and whooper swans the switch from root to cereal crops offering the highest daily rates of net energy gain also occurred between december and january 3 4 estimating resource profitability within each month the proportions of simulations for which root or cereal crops were estimated by our instantaneous net energy gain models to be the most profitable differed significantly for both swan species table 2 in addition to these within month differences we also observed differences between months root crops were typically the most profitable resource in november and december whilst cereal crops most frequently had the highest profitability in january february and march fig 5 these instantaneous energy gain models indicated no significant differences between the two swan species table 3 our models of daily net energy gain also showed the same temporal patterns for both species of swans table 2 fig 5 however our daily energy gain models suggested significant differences between bewick s and whooper swans in the monthly proportions of simulations for which cereals and root crops were most profitable for all months except november and january table 3 the proportion of simulations for which cereal crops were most profitable was higher for whooper swans than bewick s swans in december and higher for bewick s swans than whooper swans in february and march with the opposite pattern for root crops table 3 3 5 sensitivity analysis for both bewick s and whooper swans the instantaneous net rates of energy gain predicted by the deterministic versions of our models were most sensitive to the variance associated with the intake rate and food quantity parameters appendix a model predictions showed lower levels of sensitivity to the variance in the other parameters for example adjusting the value of the cereal height parameter from the mean value to the mean sd value altered the net rate of energy gain predicted for a bewick s swan feeding on cereal crops in november from 49 2 w to 83 6 w in contrast adjusting the cereal energy content parameter value from the mean to the mean sd value increased the net rate of energy gain from 49 2 w to only 50 0 w appendix a the predictions of the daily net energy gain models also showed the greatest relative sensitivity to the variance associated with the intake rate and food quantity parameters however the predictions of these models also showed sensitivity to the variance in foraging effort in some months in particular november for root crops and march for cereal crops 3 6 the influence of temporal changes in resource quantity and quality on profitability of our four competing models for each species only models that included monthly variation in resource quantity i e cereal height and root biomass density predicted correctly the most profitable resource type in each month as well as the timing of the switch in relative profitability table 4 figs 6 and 7 in contrast models that used fixed mean winter values for resource quality i e energy content were capable of accurate predictions only if monthly variation in resource quantity was included table 4 figs 6 and 7 4 discussion our study shows that comparing model based estimates of the rates of net energy gain for different food resources can facilitate understanding of animal resource selection and use within landscapes in accordance with our first hypothesis we found that the patterns in expected net energy gains and resource profitability showed the same temporal patterns as observed resource use by overwintering swans our mechanistic model showed that swans could achieve the greatest rates of net energy gain on root crops in early winter and on cereal crops in late winter taking into account the variance associated with key parameters we found that root and cereal crops were typically the most energetically profitable in early and late winter respectively the switch between root crops and cereal crops offering the greatest net rates of energy gain was predicted to occur at the same time as the birds were observed to switch from using predominantly root crops to predominantly cereal crops between december and january wood et al 2019 the agreement between our model based estimates of energy gain and the observed shifts in resource use among overwintering swans suggests that maximising net rates of energy gain is an important resource selection strategy for these birds during winter the temporal pattern of resource profitability was the same for both swan species with root crops most likely to be the most profitable in early winter and cereals most likely to be the most profitable in late winter however the daily energy gain models indicated some differences between bewick s and whooper swans in the precise likelihood of root or cereal crops being the most profitable resource type in a given month the between species differences in daily profitability were likely due to interspecific differences in the foraging effort of each species defined as the amount of time spent engaged in foraging behaviour as the species for which a resource type was more likely to be the most profitable also typically showed the greatest foraging effort on this resource type fig 2 accordingly no such between species differences were detected for the instantaneous energy gain models which did not include the foraging effort variable our model based estimates of bewick s swan energy gain on arable crops of up to 600 w were similar to previous estimates of bewick s swan energy gain when feeding on aquatic plant tubers in early winter nolet and klaassen 2009 gyimesi et al 2012a b in comparison whooper swan energetics has received less attention from researchers the high net rates of energy gain in early winter would help swans to replace the energy expended during their autumn migration to the winter grounds beekman et al 2002 furthermore our model outputs showed clear seasonal trends in rates of both net energy gain and profitability both the maximum predicted instantaneous and daily energy gains decline from early to mid winter which may reflect a change in the birds behavioural strategies from rapid refuelling in early winter to maintaining energy reserves during mid winter swan foraging effort was not observed to exceed 71 of daylight hours mean 51 which is lower than the foraging effort of 80 100 of daylight hours reported for other wintering populations of avian herbivores e g cope 2003 suggesting that our focal swans had the capacity to increase their foraging effort in order to increase their daily energy gain future comparisons of the variation in foraging effort amongst avian herbivore species using different food resources would help to improve our understanding of the capacity of birds to adjust foraging intensity and the role that this may play in the selection of food resources in each winter month one of the two resources was more likely to be more profitable than the other with root crops most likely to be the most profitable in early winter and cereals most likely to be the most profitable in late winter yet for both our instantaneous and daily energy gain models the confidence intervals associated with root and cereal crops had some overlap indicating that for example a high quality cereal field in early winter could allow a higher rate of energy gain than a poor quality root crop field in early winter despite the overall higher mean profitability of root crops in early winter crucially the upper confidence limits also suggested that swans could maintain a positive energy balance on either resource throughout winter if selecting those areas that allow higher rates of net energy gain in accordance with field data that shows that swans routinely use both habitats throughout winter rees et al 1997 wood et al 2019 fig 1 whilst foragers would typically be expected to prefer fields of the resource type predicted to be the most likely to be profitable this resource might not be used in practice if those fields are of poor quality i e fields that only permit energy gain at the lower end of the confidence interval have unsuitable characteristics or are subject to disturbance rees et al 2005 avian herbivores such as swans are highly mobile and may travel up to 20 km from their nocturnal roost sites to their diurnal feeding areas newton et al 1973 such mobility would allow individuals to assess over large areas the variability in the parameters that determine energy gain and to select the feeding sites within such areas that have values that would allow them to maximize their rates of net energy gain avian herbivores are known to select roots and tubers buried at sediment depths that allow them to maximize energy intake rates e g chen et al 2019 for example experimental evidence shows that avian herbivores prefer sward heights which enable them to achieve higher intake rates and thus higher rates of energy gain jacobsen 1992 hassall et al 2001 similarly previous research has suggested that avian herbivores can use visual cues such as how green vegetation is to assess the relative profitability of that food resource owen 1976 as well as searching strategies to locate profitable feeding patches nolet and mooij 2002 lascala gruenewald et al 2019 in accordance with our second hypothesis our results suggested that the temporal increase in cereal height and decrease in root biomass over the course of winter drove the changes in the rates of net energy gain which in turn drove the switch in resource use autumn and winter sown cereals such as wheat increase their height and hence the biomass available to foragers over winter whilst the biomass of post harvest remains of spring sown root crops declines due to decay and depletion by foragers gill et al 1996 draycott 2006 this study in contrast we found relative small changes in the energy content of cereals and root crops during winter which accordingly had little influence on the shift in resource use compared with the larger changes in food quantity however previous research has found that examining trends in food quantity alone could not explain switches in resource use by avian herbivores e g mckay et al 1994 therefore we believe that a mechanistic modelling approach facilitates a more comprehensive evaluation of the variables that may affect resource use compared with independent assessments of trends in these variables furthermore the data used to parameterise mechanistic models cost time money and other resources to collect so increased investment in data collection for one parameter is likely to result in less effort available for quantifying another parameter the findings of our robustness analysis thus have implications for future model development in addition to providing ecological insights into the variables that drive shifts in resource use by avian herbivores our simulation results suggest that future mechanistic models of avian herbivores in arable habitats should prioritise obtaining accurate data on temporal changes in the quantity of food available over the energetic quality of that food as the temporal variations in food quantity have a disproportionately large effect on model predictions of net energy gain and relative profitability using behavioural ecology to understand the mechanisms by which animals select food resources within a landscape offers the possibility of using this knowledge to improve our ability to predict and manage animals use of feeding areas as well as their impacts on economically valuable food resources sutherland 1998 wood et al 2014 berger tal and saltz 2016 as such understanding where and when avian herbivores will use food resources has clear application for environmental decision makers such insights could inform the conservation management of key feeding areas for species of conservation concern such as the bewick s swan nagy et al 2012 from our results it is clear that overwintering swans would benefit from the continued provision of both crop types throughout winter and in particular the availability of fields of root crops in early winter and cereal crops in late winter such insights can also inform the deployment of crop protection strategies to alleviate agricultural damage associated with overwintering swans laubek 1995 colhoun and day 2002 for example land managers could designate fields of high net energy gain as sacrificial feeding areas to prevent damage to surrounding crops owen 1977 wood et al 2014 the match between the predictions of swan energy gain by our mechanistic models and the observed pattern of resource use support the view that temporal patterns in swan energetics play a key role in shifts in winter resource use earlier research has also found that energy maximizing foraging strategies underpin observed shifts in feeding resources from aquatic plant tubers to root crops by bewick s swans in the netherlands nolet et al 2002 and from pasture grasses to aquatic plants by mute swans in the uk wood et al 2013 similarly amano et al 2004 found that an energy maximizing strategy caused white fronted geese to shift from feeding on rice to winter wheat while these studies together with our article provide compelling evidence that energy plays a major role in habitat selection by avian herbivores other variables such as nitrogen and other macronutrients could also have an influence future modelling which evaluates different foraging currencies would help to resolve this discussion improving our knowledge of animal decision making processes is a key step towards the development of models that can also predict animal resource use in space as well as time by considering changes in the distribution of food resources within the landscape further research should aim to forecast spatiotemporal patterns in forager resource interactions at the landscape scale and thus predict where wildlife impacts and the conflicts that arise from such impacts are most likely to occur for example the future development of spatially and temporally explicit individual based models wood et al 2015 could allow the inclusion of other factors known to influence the foraging of overwintering swans such as anthropogenic disturbance and both interference and depletion competition between foragers rees et al 2005 gyimesi et al 2012a chudzińska et al 2016 recent research has shown that avian herbivores track variable food resources within changing landscapes e g clausen et al 2018 therefore models based on mechanistic understanding of how animals select resources within a landscape will be increasingly valuable aids to decision making in the face of continued environmental change wood et al 2018 acknowledgements we
