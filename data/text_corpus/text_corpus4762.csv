23810,chlorophyll a chl a concentration indicates the abundance of phytoplankton biomass and its spatiotemporal variations fundamentally modulate the ecosystem dynamics in coastal waters compared to conventional low frequency shipboard measurements at a limited number of sampling locations satellite data provide a better spatial and temporal coverage allowing for a more synoptic view of chl a variabilities in large coastal systems such as chesapeake bay we used visible infrared imaging radiometer suite viirs satellite data from 2011 to 2018 to 1 analyze the chl a variability in chesapeake bay 2 examine the robustness of an interpolation method to fill up satellite data gaps and 3 train a machine learning based data driven model to simulate high resolution chl a variations the dataset shows clear seasonality with notable spring and summer peaks throughout the bay this is different from in situ observations at mainstem stations where the water is deep the seasonality of chl a varies in different regions with maxima concentration occurring in spring for regions near the mouths of major tributaries winter near the bay entrance and summer elsewhere a machine learning based data driven model together with data interpolating empirical orthogonal functions dineof is applied to simulate the high resolution chl a variations the dineof is used to efficiently estimate the missing records driven by external forcing including river discharge nutrient loadings solar radiation wind and air temperature the data driven model shows an overall satisfactory performance in reproducing the spatiotemporal variations of chl a with a bay wide averaged root mean square error of 1 85 ug l by combining dineof and machine learning this study demonstrates the potential of using data driven model to predict high resolution spatiotemporal variations of water quality in coastal waters keywords remote sensing machine learning data driven model phytoplankton chesapeake bay 1 introduction phytoplankton biomass is a fundamental component of aquatic ecosystems and typically indicated by chlorophyll a chl a concentration chl a is thus a key water quality index in estuarine and coastal waters high chl a mostly caused by excessive nutrient load wastewater input and warming climate harding et al 2016 is closely related to coastal hypoxia kemp et al 2005 loss of submerged aquatic vegetation orth et al 2010 and blooms of toxic cyanobacteria tango and butler 2008 chl a can be measured or estimated in multiple ways including in situ sampling continuous fluorescence based measurement and remote sensing these methods have different advantages and limitations in terms of data accuracy spatial coverage and temporal resolution in situ sampling followed by laboratory analysis is still a typical routine for field surveys and probably the most precise way to measure chl a however this method is effort intensive and time consuming abbas et al 2019 the resulting data often have poor spatial and temporal coverage the limitation of spatial coverage also applies to continuous fluorescence based measurement at a fixed station in contrast remote sensing data especially those satellite based provide a better spatial coverage and permit a more synoptic assessment of larger scale phytoplankton dynamics drawbacks of satellite data are its accuracy in absolute values and that only surface values are available recent advances in remote sensing provide us valuable opportunities to examine the detailed spatial variabilities and to improve our understanding of the phytoplankton dynamics different from salinity or temperature that often smoothly changes over time and space in non eddy coastal seas chl a can be highly patchy and variable martin et al 2002 primarily because phytoplankton grows and aggregates in short timescale days and their concentrations are sensitive to not only temperature salinity and nutrient but also spatially varying light and flushing conditions lucas et al 2009 qin and shen 2021 as a result traditional shipboard measurements conducted monthly or bimonthly at a limited number of stations as in prominent oceanic monitoring programs could be insufficient to represent the short term variations of chl a and algal blooms in a large waterbody nevertheless the snapshot data of chl a are still the best data to validate numerical models because of the high variability of chl a numerical models often have poor performance in chl a simulation compared to other water quality state variables e g testa et al 2014 feng et al 2015 irby et al 2016 assessment of model performance is complicated by the fact that the horizontal discretion of space in a numerical model is much larger than the area represented by a monitoring station for instance numerical models e g testa et al 2014 du and shen 2016 applied to chesapeake bay have spatial resolution on the order of 1000 m spatially averaged chl a could be an important alternative reference to compare with numerical model simulations therefore a bay wide distribution of chl a revealed from high resolution satellite data will be of great interest to the modeling community in this study we analyze the spatial and temporal variations of chl a based on visible infrared imaging radiometer suite viirs data this dataset has a nearly daily frequency and a spatial resolution of 750 m zheng and digiacomo 2020 the dataset has been successfully applied to analyze the linkage between phytoplankton and bottom oxygen in the chesapeake bay zheng and digiacomo 2020 the data are available since late 2011 reliability of the data is verified with existing long record of monthly shipboard measurements by chesapeake bay program another objective of this study is to examine the feasibility of using the machine learning method to predict chl a variations with high spatial resolution in coastal bays despite many efforts in numerical models it is still difficult to accurately predict phytoplankton biomass because their spatiotemporal variations are not only subject to physical transport and mixing processes but also significantly regulated by highly nonlinear biogeochemical processes inside the water column and at the water sediment interface beck 1987 arhonditsis and brett 2004 fennel et al 2006 due to errors in hydrodynamic simulation and uncertainties in the parameterization of biogeochemical processes numerical models have typically unsatisfactory performance for simulating phytoplankton biomass especially in coastal waters inspired by the rapid accumulation of observation data and recent advances in machine learning technology there are increasing efforts and promising results in data driven modeling for water quality e g muller and muller 2015 shen et al 2019 yu et al 2020 for instance the data driven model developed by yu and shen 2021 has shown a good performance in simulating the vertical profile and variability of chl a along the main axis of chesapeake bay this study is to further test the feasibility of applying the newly developed data driven model to simulate chl a using high resolution satellite data and to examine the temporal scales to which the data model is able to simulate with reasonable accuracy compared to the simulation of chl a at a limited number of monitoring stations simulating bay wide chl a using satellite data will encounter a major challenge raised by its high variability in both space and time as well as extensive gaps in satellite data we will discuss a promising method and the necessity to fill these data gaps 2 materials and methods 2 1 in situ observational measurements since 1985 water quality parameters including salinity temperature nutrient and chl a at a number of stations see fig 1a for the along mainstem stations have been measured by ship surveys carried out monthly or bi monthly data available at https www chesapeakebay net long term 1985 2019 historical records of chl a at 37 mainstem bay stations were collected to verify the satellite data despite the spatial and temporal limitations on sampling resolution this dataset has provided a reliable basis in previous studies e g hagy et al 2004 kemp et al 2005 murphy et al 2011 only surface chl a data at mainstem stations were used to compare with satellite derived chl a the surface water samples are collected at 0 5 m below the surface the dataset was also used to examine the variability of chl a by analyzing the long term mean standard deviation relative standard deviation and seasonal mean at each station the relative standard deviation was computed as the standard deviation normalized by the mean 2 2 satellite data the viirs satellite data of chl a were used for this study the satellite derived chl a is calculated in three general steps first the quasi analytical algorithm lee et al 2002 version 6 http www ioccg org groups software html was applied to the satellite remote sensing reflectance to obtain the spectral total non water absorption coefficient second the generalized stacked constraints model gscm zheng and digiacomo 2017 was applied to partition the total non water absorption into algal and non algal components lastly chl a was calculated from the algal absorption coefficient at 670 nm the gscm has been applied to chesapeake bay and the results have shown significantly improved accuracy of satellite derived chl a zheng and digiacomo 2017 however gscm provides no feasible solutions when the light absorption coefficient of water is subject to large errors in areas such as the highly turbid upper bay it is also worth noting that the chl a retrieval method used in this study was developed using field data from the chesapeake bay for another coastal region the current method could be applied for optimal accuracy it is helpful to tune the models with field data collected in that region including the spectral absorption coefficients of algal and non algal components the viirs satellite data have a spatial resolution of 750 m its high resolution permits examination of the lateral variations across the bay s mainstem and within major tributaries see an example satellite image in fig 1b c for this study chl a concentrations were averaged over all available days within a 7 day interval and gridded into a prescribed mesh resolution of 0 015 0 015 degree from 75 5w to 77w in longitude and from 36 8n to 39 6n in latitude a null value was assigned when there was no data within a 7 day period at a given grid comparison between in situ measurements and 7 day averaged satellite data within a 3 day window of the observation date and within 750 m radius from the monitoring station shows a good agreement with r2 of 0 56 and rmse of 4 7 μ g l fig 1d the discrepancies between satellite chl a and in situ measurements could be due to a number of inherited issues related to satellite data and comparison between satellite data and observations including 1 some high and low chl a values were excluded by the gscm model 2 bias arise when light absorption coefficient of water is subject to large errors and 3 chl a concentrations varies during the day due to tide and light condition while satellite data only provide one chl a value each day currently 3 day windows were used to extract chl a data due to missing data and averaged concentrations within 750 m radius from the monitoring stations were used for comparison which could introduce additional bias the extracted pixel based chl a data have substantial gaps even after a 7 day averaging there are still areas with gap percentage greater than 50 these areas were excluded from analysis in total there are 4813 grid points with gap percentage of less than 50 in the study region see fig 1a for the region of interest on average these selected grid points have about 20 of gaps there was persistent high percentage of gaps in specific months e g april fig s1 2 3 dineof to simulate the spatiotemporal variations of chl a with a data driven model no data gaps are allowed yu and shen 2021 one choice is to remove grids that have data gaps which however will result in much less sampling points leading to a poor spatial coverage another choice is to interpolate the missing records interpolation can be a feasible option when the variable shares the same covariance either spatially or temporally the method we used to interpolate the missing records is described below data interpolating empirical orthogonal functions dineof is an eof based method to fill in missing data from geophysical fields beckers and rixen 2003 the gap filing procedure is to iteratively decompose the data field via singular value decomposition svd until the best solution is found this is done by progressively including more eof modes in the truncated reconstruction of the data until minimization of error converges between interpolated values and reference values a procedure is briefly described here with the algorithm shown in fig 2 which depicts two major loops one to get optimal estimation under a given number of modes and the other to determine the optimal number of eof modes for detailed descriptions readers are referred to beckers and rixen 2003 and alvera azcárate et al 2016 let the original data matrix be x with x ij being the value at location i and at moment j and there are missing data points with i j belonging to i1 a randomly selected subset of non missing data with i j belonging to i2 is used as reference 1 of records are used in this study first the long term mean is removed from the dataset second for data points in i1 and i2 zero values are assigned to generate a new matrix x 0 a svd decomposition of matrix x 0 gives the first estimate of the spatial and temporal eigen vectors u and v as well as their singular values d the diagonal matrix 1 udv x 0 x 0 will be updated with truncated reconstruction using the obtained eof eigen vectors for both data points in i1 and i2 2 x 0 i j u n d n v n i j i j i1 i 2 the truncated here refers to the practice of using a limited number of eof modes n instead of all modes after step 2 root mean square error rmse between the true value and interpolated value in the reference dataset i2 will be calculated 3 r m s e x 0 x 2 m i j i2 by repeating steps 1 3 the rmse will decrease with more iterations for a given number of modes these steps will be repeated until the rmse does not decrease by a predefined value 1 10 5 is used in this study to determine the optimal number of modes denoted by n used in the truncated reconstruction the above loop will start with n 1 when the rmse decreases but by less than the prescribed criterion with additional iteration n increases by 1 if the rmse starts to increase after increasing n by 1 the entire procedure stops the optimal number of modes is n 1 robustness of the method has been demonstrated by extensive applications for satellite data e g alvera azcárate et al 2016 hilborn and costa 2018 yang et al 2021 in this study we run dineof with open source language r code available at http modb oce ulg ac be mediawiki index php dineof for 7 day averaged satellite data the optimal number of eof modes is 16 the rmse between reference records and interpolated values decreases greatly when the number of modes increases from 1 to 9 while rmse decreases negligibly after 10 modes fig 3a therefore we included 10 modes in the data driven model these 10 modes account for 80 of the total variance an experiment was conducted to verify the interpolation we randomly set 1 of records with null values and these records are independent dataset different from the internal reference records used during dineof the interpolated data for the missing records were then compared to the true values values before being masked as null results show dineof could estimate the missing records with acceptable error with rmse of 1 78 μ g l fig 3b the error could increase when chl a is extremely large fig 3b c the gap free data were used to train and verify a data driven model 2 4 data driven model a data driven model introduced by yu and shen 2021 was applied to simulate the spatial and temporal variations of chl a the data driven model comprises three major components empirical orthogonal function eof artificial neural network and forcing transformation auto selection eof is applied to reduce the dimension of data by extracting the spatial pattern and temporal variations of principal components the temporal variations of principal components will be simulated by the artificial neural network distinguished from previous studies that use in situ measurements of other water quality parameters as inputs e g scardi and harding 1999 soro et al 2020 the data driven model here uses only external forcings including river flow and nutrient loadings from large tributaries susquehanna potomac and james rivers data from usgs https www usgs gov air temperature measured at chesapeake bay bridge tunnel station data from noaa database https tidesandcurrents noaa gov short wave solar radiation and wind at 10 m above ground extracted from global era5 reanalyzed product by european centre for medium range weather forecasts https www ecmwf int all forcing data were transformed by multiple methods e g accumulative average time delay and log transform to account for the impact of transport processes on chl a yu and shen 2021 the temporal variations of each of the 10 eof modes from satellite data were simulated using the neural network that takes external forcings as inputs for each mode the datasets including inputs and outputs were divided into two sub datasets with the first 75 of records for training i e 2011 2016 and the other 25 for prediction i e 2017 2018 the prediction sub dataset also known as the testing dataset do not involve in the eof and training process both the training and testing periods include years with annual mean streamflow into the chesapeake bay above and below median value of historical records based on usgs analysis see https www usgs gov centers chesapeake bay activities science freshwater flow chesapeake bay last accessed 8 16 2022 respectively the test data can be considered as an independent dataset in general data driven model always benefits from more data that covers more variabilities under different external forcing conditions considering the randomness in initialization of neural network parameters the outcome or prediction differs for each training even with the same inputs to address this uncertainty we trained the model 50 times for each mode and the ensemble mean of the predictions was used for model performance assessment details of the model description and procedures can be found in yu and shen 2021 simulating the satellite derived chl a in this study is a follow up of yu and shen 2021 to demonstrate the capability of the data driven model to predict high resolution large scale variations of water quality in coastal systems 3 results 3 1 in situ monitoring data the historical shipboard measurements of chl a show a similar pattern for mean standard deviation and relative standard deviation fig 4 all of them have a higher value in the middle upper bay specifically the region between 38 5n 39n and lower value in the lower bay and the upper most region close to susquehanna river outflow low values in the upper most region is likely caused by turbidity induced light limitation harding et al 1992 zhang et al 2021 in addition there are noticeable lateral variabilities with larger chl a at stations in shallow shoals e g cb3 3w cb4 1w cb4 2w cb4 3w rather than the deep channel furthermore the pattern is persistent between the 35 year and the 8 year period from 2011 2018 when satellite data are available fig s2 it is worth noting the high variability at these upper bay stations which may be attributed to the fluctuation of turbidity maximum zone induced by changing river discharge wind forcing and estuarine circulation sanford et al 2001 when the turbidity maximum zone shifts northward more stations will be exposed to a better light condition that favors the growth of phytoplankton stations within the turbidity maximum zone fluctuation area presumably have higher temporal variability of light condition and thus chl a concentration another interesting fact is the spatial heterogeneity in chl a seasonality indicated by climatological monthly means different from the conventional understanding that spring bloom dominates in chesapeake bay about half of the monitoring stations 18 of the 37 stations have a larger peak of chl a in summer months while 13 stations have a larger peak of chl a in spring months fig 4d near the bay entrance chl a has a weak peak in late fall or winter the spatially varying seasonality suggests that there are likely different limiting factors controlling algal bloom in different regions of the bay zhang et al 2021 in particular the summer bloom may be attributed to prolonged solar radiation and higher temperature that favor growth of different species e g dinoflagellates other than diatom strong stratification established following spring high flow murphy et al 2011 and bottom nutrient fluxes associated with seasonal hypoxia kemp et al 2005 during summertime could also contribute to the summer bloom 3 2 satellite data the 8 year mean of chl a satellite data show a similar spatial pattern as in the observation but with clearer and detailed lateral distributions fig 5 mean chl a increases from the bay mouth to the upper bay with noticeable larger values near both east and west shallow shoals compared to the deep channel fig 5a this lateral distribution is consistent with observation however some differences between the two datasets are also noticeable for instance near 39n the maximum mean chl a exceeds 20 μ g l in shipboard measurement while the value is lower in the satellite data variability of chl a indicated by relative standard deviation rstd has two high value regions one in the upper bay and the other in the coastal ocean fig 5c a relatively high variability is found in the middle bay right off the potomac river mouth which is not captured by the observational dataset primarily due to limited monitoring efforts in this region the high variability of chl a in this region may be attributed to hydrodynamic interaction between the mainstem and tributaries which is known to play a key role in exchange of soluble materials e g dissolved oxygen within the estuarine system kuo and neilson 1987 it is worth noting that the rstd of satellite data is relatively smaller than that from observational data largely because satellite data is averaged over a certain period 7 day and over a certain area 1 0 km in the case of gridded satellite data while observation data are based on instantaneous measurements once or twice each month and at a particular location compared to std which decrease seaward the rstd for both satellite data and in situ measurements decrease then increase from upper to lower bay the underlying reason is the much smaller mean chl a concentration near the bay mouth with the high resolution data we can map the timing of algal bloom for each grid the climatological monthly mean was calculated and the month with peak mean chl a was determined as the peak month the peak month exhibits interesting spatial patterns largely consistent with the chl a observations fig 5d spring peak occurs in the upper bay inside the lower potomac river off the potomac river mouth and near the james river mouth summer peak occurs mainly in the upper bay 38 39n and lower bay 37 37 5n spring peak regions share one key factor they are close to the mouth of major tributaries e g susquehanna potomac rappahannock york james and choptank rivers note that the spring peak does not occur near patuxent and chester rivers the other two major tributaries which coincides with the fact that these two rivers have the smallest mean river discharge among major tributaries the peak month seems to be regulated by discharge and corresponds to the time when riverine nutrients reach the given location timing of blooms are possibly induced by both transport processes and nutrient supply it will take 100 300 days for riverine material discharged from susquehanna river to reach the lower bay the transport time varies depending on flow regimes and wind field shen and wang 2007 the seasonality of satellite derived chl a is characterized by a clearly larger value in spring and summer compared to the other two seasons fig s3 fig 6 the maximum value in the mid summer or spring is about twice the value in the winter time two seasonal peaks persist throughout the entire bay and are most notable in the upper bay compared to middle or lower bay the two peak seasonal characteristic is more obvious from eof analysis fig 7 the first eof mode accounting for 32 4 of the total variance features positive spatial values throughout the entire bay meaning that bay wide chl a changes in phase the mode has clear seasonality with two peaks one in march and the other in july the second eof mode accounting for 24 7 shows out of phase variations between upper middle to upper bay region and the lower middle to lower bay region in this mode when high chl a occurs in the one region the chl a will be low in the other region suggesting the different seasonal variation between upper and lower bay the third mode features high variability in middle bay where the variation is opposed to both upper and lower bay the fourth mode represents the variability in the upper bay it can be expected that the response of each mode to external forcings will be different 3 3 simulation of chl a with data driven model the temporal variations of a limited number of principal components were simulated by the data driven model the training results of the first 5 modes 2011 2016 are shown in fig 8 model performance for the testing period 2017 2018 is more meaningful as input forcing and target variable in the testing period do not involve during training in any aspect the overall spatial pattern of modeled chl a anomalies relative to the long term mean and full signal agree well with that in satellite observed chl a see two example dates representing spring and fall in fig 9 the seasonal variability is well captured despite discrepancies in some regions more importantly the data driven model reproduces the strong contrast of chl a concentration between the bay and the adjacent coastal ocean as expected the data driven model no matter how well tuned will not capture every detail of chl a s spatial variations for instance the model captures the spring bloom e g in april of 2017 but the predicted magnitude is less than observation the underestimation could be caused by 1 uncertainty in the forcing data 2 inherent error in the neural network model and 3 error in the satellite data comparisons of time series at selected six stations fig 10 show that the model performance seems to decrease toward the upper bay in the lower bay e g station cb6 2 and cb7 3 the model well captures the seasonal and interannual variations of satellite chl a fig 10 model performance is also satisfactory in the middle bay however the model has difficulty reproducing the high variability in the upper bay e g station cb3 3c the spatial heterogeneity of model performance suggests that the upper bay chl a is less predictable compared to that in the lower bay error of satellite data due to high turbidity in the upper bay is likely a factor leading to the lower performance in that region first high colored dissolved organic matter in the estuarine turbidity maximum could decrease the accuracy of satellite chl a second phytoplankton tends to produce more chl a pigment per biomass when light is limited which complicates the relationship between external forcings and chl a the model performance varies spatially as indicated by the root mean square error rmse and the relative error re between predicted and observed chl a re and rmse show noticeable spatial heterogeneity with the worst performance in the eastern shoals between 37 5n and 38 5n and in the upper bay averaged over all the grids rmse is around 1 85 μ g l fig 11 4 discussion 4 1 in situ observation vs satellite data comparison between in situ observations and satellite data has confirmed the reliability of the satellite data in terms of several aspects including the lateral difference between shoals and the deep channel longitudinal decreasing trend from the upper bay to the lower bay and the peak timing however we acknowledge that there are noticeable differences in the magnitude of temporal variability between these two different datasets a major difference is in the bay wide averaged standard deviation of monthly mean chl a which is 8 8 μ g l in the in situ measurements compared to 3 3 μ g l in the satellite data the low variability in satellite data may be attributed to three possible factors 1 satellite data are 7 day averaged as opposed to instantaneous values with monthly sometimes bi monthly sampling frequency in cbp data 2 each record of viirs data represents an average of chl a concentration over a finite area e g 750 m 750 m in the viirs data thus variability of satellite based chl a concentration tends to be smaller 3 there is an inherent error when estimating chl a from satellite data both extremely low and high values are likely to be excluded when establishing the conversion function zheng et al 2015 both satellite data and in situ measurements demonstrate a remarkable difference between the deep channel and flanking shoals the underlying mechanisms can be further explored if given more information on nutrient salinity and temperature vertical profiles in both shoals and deep channel possible mechanism responsible for the lateral difference include 1 different flushing capacity between shoal and channel with water being more dispersive and moving faster in the mainstem xiong et al 2021 and thus less favorable for phytoplankton to aggregate when comparing to shoals tidal waters with stronger flushing capacity are known to have less chance of sustaining an algal bloom lucas et al 2009 qin and shen 2021 second the vertical mixing layer is about 10 m at the deep channel yu et al 2020 while the bottom of shoals is usually below this depth there is a larger chance that phytoplankton grows and accumulates to a thinner water column in shoals when light is available cai et al 2021 in another word the shoal water is less dispersive in the vertical direction and thus more productive third nutrient released from the seafloor is more accessible to phytoplankton in shallow waters because vertical mixing is much stronger in contrast the persistent pycnocline at the deep channel will limit the vertical nutrient flux from bottom to surface the satellite data highlight two notable chl a peaks spring and summer throughout the entire bay which is different from the in situ observations at mainstem stations where the water column is deep previous eof analysis reported in yu and shen 2021 based on in situ chl a concentration at 16 mainstem stations excluding stations at shallow shoals show that the first mode is featured with only one peak in march while eof analysis with satellite data clearly shows two comparable peaks the spring bloom is a well known ecological feature in chesapeake bay it results from the stimulus of spring high flow after snowmelt in watersheds that feed the major rivers harding and perry 1997 the summer bloom hardly revealed in in situ measurements is believed as a secondary bloom fueled by nutrients released from the sediment and recycled nutrients in the water column malone et al 1996 kemp et al 2005 this difference between satellite data and in situ measurements points to the important contribution of shallow shoals in the overall variance of chl a 4 2 dealing with data gaps there are several major challenges in high resolution simulation of water quality variables in both data driven and numerical models success of a numerical model relies on accurate prediction of local hydrodynamics and comprehensive parameterization of biogeochemical processes while for a data driven model the integrity of data itself both input forcing and target variable is particularly important one of the problems for the gscm derived satellite chl a data is substantial data gaps because the algorithm requires proper spectral shape in the input total absorption spectrum which is often not satisfied leading to the inability to identify feasible solutions zheng and digiacomo 2017 for the gscm derived viirs chl a data in chesapeake bay gaps are noticeable 20 even after a 7 day blending data gaps in coastal regions tend to appear more frequently in a specific season due to seasonal atmospheric and turbidity conditions for instance the bay wide satellite data show persistent high data gaps in april and may with gap percentages frequently exceeding 30 fig s1 it has been shown here that dineof provides a good estimation of the missing data fig 3b c one major advantage of dineof is that the interpolation does not need any prior knowledge of the correlation between data points beckers and rixen 2003 a large number of data points and record length at each data points are needed which is not an issue for satellite data dineof is therefore suitable for interpolating missing records in satellite data furthermore the auto detection of optimal number of eof mode provides an effective way to determine how many modes are needed to simulate in the data driven model broken stick method yu and shen 2021 suggests 33 modes are needed which is much more than the optimal number determined by dineof the dineof based optimal mode selection is more suitable for the data driven model considering the gappy nature of the satellite data it is worth noting that extreme high and low values from the original data are generally underestimated by dineof fig 3b which also contributes to the less variability of satellite chl a fig 5 4 3 higher frequency simulation for water quality variables in coastal waters the dominant frequency could be hourly daily or monthly depending on how quickly the underlying processes respond to external forcings for instance nutrient level in the lower bay typically responds to wind or river discharge induced perturbations with dominant frequency of several days in a much slower manner compared to temperature or salinity while the nutrient level is a key factor controlling the growth of phytoplankton variations of chl a concentration are subject to a variety of factors including water temperature vertical mixing horizontal dispersion light condition and abundance of predators these factors have a wide spectrum of frequencies ranging from hourly to monthly and need to be considered when simulating chl a ideally hourly or daily simulations are preferred when modeling chl a however several limiting factors make such high frequency simulations extremely difficult first despite daily frequency satellite data have large gaps if not blended over a period of multiple days inherent gaps in satellite data are from clouds atmospheric haze glint etc about 600 over the available 2000 days have data gaps less than 50 meaning only 30 of satellite images cover half of the bay second some external forcings are not available on daily frequency for instance nutrient loading data used in the model is available from usgs on a monthly basis using monthly nutrient input to simulate daily chl a variations will likely result in poorer model performance we conducted two simulations using monthly and daily chl a data and compared the model performance to that using 7 day average missing records in chl a data for these two simulations are also interpolated using dineof for daily data only those images with data gap less than 50 were used same forcings and model settings are applied for these two simulations the model has the best performance using monthly data while it has the worst performance using daily data fig s4 s5 monthly simulation has the smallest rmse and re when averaged over the domain of interest fig s4 specifically rmse in the upper bay is largely reduced compared to the 7 day simulation fig 11 for daily simulation rmse is also high in the upper bay but the rmse is smaller in tributaries including james and potomac river which results in a slightly smaller overall rmse when compared with the 7 day simulation fig s5 however the re in daily simulation is extremely high in several regions including areas near the bay mouth the upper bay and eastern shoals at 38n the overall model performance is shown in fig 12 re decreases from daily to 7 day and to monthly while the monthly simulation has the best model performance the monthly mean will omit a major portion of chl a variability using a 7 day average for chl a simulation is a balance of the model performance and data representativeness 5 conclusions analysis of recently available high resolution satellite data demonstrates the spatial heterogeneity of mean chl a concentration its variability and the peak timing patterns revealed by satellite data are consistent with that of long term monitoring data suggesting the reliability of the satellite data both satellite data and long term in situ measurements reveal higher mean and variability of chl a in shallow shoals than in the deep channel and different timing of seasonal peaks between the upper and middle bay different from in situ measurements the satellite data however highlight the existence of summer peak of chl a throughout the bay indicating the necessity of incorporating the shallow shoal for a bay wide analysis compared to low frequency shipboard measurements at a limited number of monitoring stations we believe satellite derived chl a could serve as an alternative reliable reference for numerical models performance assessment we also implemented dineof into the existing data driven model to address the issue of substantial gaps in satellite data sensitivity tests confirm that dineof is an appropriate way to fill data gaps with reasonable accuracy the model is applied to simulate high spatial resolution satellite based chl a concentration the overall model performance for predicting both spatial and temporal variation of chl a is satisfactory this study highlights the potential of using a data driven model for high resolution water quality

shows clear seasonality with notable spring and summer peaks throughout the bay this is different from in situ observations at mainstem stations where the water is deep the seasonality of chl a varies in different regions with maxima concentration occurring in spring for regions near the mouths of major tributaries winter near the bay entrance and summer elsewhere a machine learning based data driven model together with data interpolating empirical orthogonal functions dineof is applied to simulate the high resolution chl a variations the dineof is used to efficiently estimate the missing records driven by external forcing including river discharge nutrient loadings solar radiation wind and air temperature the data driven model shows an overall satisfactory performance in reproducing the spatiotemporal variations of chl a with a bay wide averaged root mean square error of 1 85 ug l by combining dineof and machine learning this study demonstrates the potential of using data driven model to predict high resolution spatiotemporal variations of water quality in coastal waters keywords remote sensing machine learning data driven model phytoplankton chesapeake bay 1 introduction phytoplankton biomass is a fundamental component of aquatic ecosystems and typically indicated by chlorophyll a chl a concentration chl a is thus a key water quality index in estuarine and coastal waters high chl a mostly caused by excessive nutrient load wastewater input and warming climate harding et al 2016 is closely related to coastal hypoxia kemp et al 2005 loss of submerged aquatic vegetation orth et al 2010 and blooms of toxic cyanobacteria tango and butler 2008 chl a can be measured or estimated in multiple ways including in situ sampling continuous fluorescence based measurement and remote sensing these methods have different advantages and limitations in terms of data accuracy spatial coverage and temporal resolution in situ sampling followed by laboratory analysis is still a typical routine for field surveys and probably the most precise way to measure chl a however this method is effort intensive and time consuming abbas et al 2019 the resulting data often have poor spatial and temporal coverage the limitation of spatial coverage also applies to continuous fluorescence based measurement at a fixed station in contrast remote sensing data especially those satellite based provide a better spatial coverage and permit a more synoptic assessment of larger scale phytoplankton dynamics drawbacks of satellite data are its accuracy in absolute values and that only surface values are available recent advances in remote sensing provide us valuable opportunities to examine the detailed spatial variabilities and to improve our understanding of the phytoplankton dynamics different from salinity or temperature that often smoothly changes over time and space in non eddy coastal seas chl a can be highly patchy and variable martin et al 2002 primarily because phytoplankton grows and aggregates in short timescale days and their concentrations are sensitive to not only temperature salinity and nutrient but also spatially varying light and flushing conditions lucas et al 2009 qin and shen 2021 as a result traditional shipboard measurements conducted monthly or bimonthly at a limited number of stations as in prominent oceanic monitoring programs could be insufficient to represent the short term variations of chl a and algal blooms in a large waterbody nevertheless the snapshot data of chl a are still the best data to validate numerical models because of the high variability of chl a numerical models often have poor performance in chl a simulation compared to other water quality state variables e g testa et al 2014 feng et al 2015 irby et al 2016 assessment of model performance is complicated by the fact that the horizontal discretion of space in a numerical model is much larger than the area represented by a monitoring station for instance numerical models e g testa et al 2014 du and shen 2016 applied to chesapeake bay have spatial resolution on the order of 1000 m spatially averaged chl a could be an important alternative reference to compare with numerical model simulations therefore a bay wide distribution of chl a revealed from high resolution satellite data will be of great interest to the modeling community in this study we analyze the spatial and temporal variations of chl a based on visible infrared imaging radiometer suite viirs data this dataset has a nearly daily frequency and a spatial resolution of 750 m zheng and digiacomo 2020 the dataset has been successfully applied to analyze the linkage between phytoplankton and bottom oxygen in the chesapeake bay zheng and digiacomo 2020 the data are available since late 2011 reliability of the data is verified with existing long record of monthly shipboard measurements by chesapeake bay program another objective of this study is to examine the feasibility of using the machine learning method to predict chl a variations with high spatial resolution in coastal bays despite many efforts in numerical models it is still difficult to accurately predict phytoplankton biomass because their spatiotemporal variations are not only subject to physical transport and mixing processes but also significantly regulated by highly nonlinear biogeochemical processes inside the water column and at the water sediment interface beck 1987 arhonditsis and brett 2004 fennel et al 2006 due to errors in hydrodynamic simulation and uncertainties in the parameterization of biogeochemical processes numerical models have typically unsatisfactory performance for simulating phytoplankton biomass especially in coastal waters inspired by the rapid accumulation of observation data and recent advances in machine learning technology there are increasing efforts and promising results in data driven modeling for water quality e g muller and muller 2015 shen et al 2019 yu et al 2020 for instance the data driven model developed by yu and shen 2021 has shown a good performance in simulating the vertical profile and variability of chl a along the main axis of chesapeake bay this study is to further test the feasibility of applying the newly developed data driven model to simulate chl a using high resolution satellite data and to examine the temporal scales to which the data model is able to simulate with reasonable accuracy compared to the simulation of chl a at a limited number of monitoring stations simulating bay wide chl a using satellite data will encounter a major challenge raised by its high variability in both space and time as well as extensive gaps in satellite data we will discuss a promising method and the necessity to fill these data gaps 2 materials and methods 2 1 in situ observational measurements since 1985 water quality parameters including salinity temperature nutrient and chl a at a number of stations see fig 1a for the along mainstem stations have been measured by ship surveys carried out monthly or bi monthly data available at https www chesapeakebay net long term 1985 2019 historical records of chl a at 37 mainstem bay stations were collected to verify the satellite data despite the spatial and temporal limitations on sampling resolution this dataset has provided a reliable basis in previous studies e g hagy et al 2004 kemp et al 2005 murphy et al 2011 only surface chl a data at mainstem stations were used to compare with satellite derived chl a the surface water samples are collected at 0 5 m below the surface the dataset was also used to examine the variability of chl a by analyzing the long term mean standard deviation relative standard deviation and seasonal mean at each station the relative standard deviation was computed as the standard deviation normalized by the mean 2 2 satellite data the viirs satellite data of chl a were used for this study the satellite derived chl a is calculated in three general steps first the quasi analytical algorithm lee et al 2002 version 6 http www ioccg org groups software html was applied to the satellite remote sensing reflectance to obtain the spectral total non water absorption coefficient second the generalized stacked constraints model gscm zheng and digiacomo 2017 was applied to partition the total non water absorption into algal and non algal components lastly chl a was calculated from the algal absorption coefficient at 670 nm the gscm has been applied to chesapeake bay and the results have shown significantly improved accuracy of satellite derived chl a zheng and digiacomo 2017 however gscm provides no feasible solutions when the light absorption coefficient of water is subject to large errors in areas such as the highly turbid upper bay it is also worth noting that the chl a retrieval method used in this study was developed using field data from the chesapeake bay for another coastal region the current method could be applied for optimal accuracy it is helpful to tune the models with field data collected in that region including the spectral absorption coefficients of algal and non algal components the viirs satellite data have a spatial resolution of 750 m its high resolution permits examination of the lateral variations across the bay s mainstem and within major tributaries see an example satellite image in fig 1b c for this study chl a concentrations were averaged over all available days within a 7 day interval and gridded into a prescribed mesh resolution of 0 015 0 015 degree from 75 5w to 77w in longitude and from 36 8n to 39 6n in latitude a null value was assigned when there was no data within a 7 day period at a given grid comparison between in situ measurements and 7 day averaged satellite data within a 3 day window of the observation date and within 750 m radius from the monitoring station shows a good agreement with r2 of 0 56 and rmse of 4 7 μ g l fig 1d the discrepancies between satellite chl a and in situ measurements could be due to a number of inherited issues related to satellite data and comparison between satellite data and observations including 1 some high and low chl a values were excluded by the gscm model 2 bias arise when light absorption coefficient of water is subject to large errors and 3 chl a concentrations varies during the day due to tide and light condition while satellite data only provide one chl a value each day currently 3 day windows were used to extract chl a data due to missing data and averaged concentrations within 750 m radius from the monitoring stations were used for comparison which could introduce additional bias the extracted pixel based chl a data have substantial gaps even after a 7 day averaging there are still areas with gap percentage greater than 50 these areas were excluded from analysis in total there are 4813 grid points with gap percentage of less than 50 in the study region see fig 1a for the region of interest on average these selected grid points have about 20 of gaps there was persistent high percentage of gaps in specific months e g april fig s1 2 3 dineof to simulate the spatiotemporal variations of chl a with a data driven model no data gaps are allowed yu and shen 2021 one choice is to remove grids that have data gaps which however will result in much less sampling points leading to a poor spatial coverage another choice is to interpolate the missing records interpolation can be a feasible option when the variable shares the same covariance either spatially or temporally the method we used to interpolate the missing records is described below data interpolating empirical orthogonal functions dineof is an eof based method to fill in missing data from geophysical fields beckers and rixen 2003 the gap filing procedure is to iteratively decompose the data field via singular value decomposition svd until the best solution is found this is done by progressively including more eof modes in the truncated reconstruction of the data until minimization of error converges between interpolated values and reference values a procedure is briefly described here with the algorithm shown in fig 2 which depicts two major loops one to get optimal estimation under a given number of modes and the other to determine the optimal number of eof modes for detailed descriptions readers are referred to beckers and rixen 2003 and alvera azcárate et al 2016 let the original data matrix be x with x ij being the value at location i and at moment j and there are missing data points with i j belonging to i1 a randomly selected subset of non missing data with i j belonging to i2 is used as reference 1 of records are used in this study first the long term mean is removed from the dataset second for data points in i1 and i2 zero values are assigned to generate a new matrix x 0 a svd decomposition of matrix x 0 gives the first estimate of the spatial and temporal eigen vectors u and v as well as their singular values d the diagonal matrix 1 udv x 0 x 0 will be updated with truncated reconstruction using the obtained eof eigen vectors for both data points in i1 and i2 2 x 0 i j u n d n v n i j i j i1 i 2 the truncated here refers to the practice of using a limited number of eof modes n instead of all modes after step 2 root mean square error rmse between the true value and interpolated value in the reference dataset i2 will be calculated 3 r m s e x 0 x 2 m i j i2 by repeating steps 1 3 the rmse will decrease with more iterations for a given number of modes these steps will be repeated until the rmse does not decrease by a predefined value 1 10 5 is used in this study to determine the optimal number of modes denoted by n used in the truncated reconstruction the above loop will start with n 1 when the rmse decreases but by less than the prescribed criterion with additional iteration n increases by 1 if the rmse starts to increase after increasing n by 1 the entire procedure stops the optimal number of modes is n 1 robustness of the method has been demonstrated by extensive applications for satellite data e g alvera azcárate et al 2016 hilborn and costa 2018 yang et al 2021 in this study we run dineof with open source language r code available at http modb oce ulg ac be mediawiki index php dineof for 7 day averaged satellite data the optimal number of eof modes is 16 the rmse between reference records and interpolated values decreases greatly when the number of modes increases from 1 to 9 while rmse decreases negligibly after 10 modes fig 3a therefore we included 10 modes in the data driven model these 10 modes account for 80 of the total variance an experiment was conducted to verify the interpolation we randomly set 1 of records with null values and these records are independent dataset different from the internal reference records used during dineof the interpolated data for the missing records were then compared to the true values values before being masked as null results show dineof could estimate the missing records with acceptable error with rmse of 1 78 μ g l fig 3b the error could increase when chl a is extremely large fig 3b c the gap free data were used to train and verify a data driven model 2 4 data driven model a data driven model introduced by yu and shen 2021 was applied to simulate the spatial and temporal variations of chl a the data driven model comprises three major components empirical orthogonal function eof artificial neural network and forcing transformation auto selection eof is applied to reduce the dimension of data by extracting the spatial pattern and temporal variations of principal components the temporal variations of principal components will be simulated by the artificial neural network distinguished from previous studies that use in situ measurements of other water quality parameters as inputs e g scardi and harding 1999 soro et al 2020 the data driven model here uses only external forcings including river flow and nutrient loadings from large tributaries susquehanna potomac and james rivers data from usgs https www usgs gov air temperature measured at chesapeake bay bridge tunnel station data from noaa database https tidesandcurrents noaa gov short wave solar radiation and wind at 10 m above ground extracted from global era5 reanalyzed product by european centre for medium range weather forecasts https www ecmwf int all forcing data were transformed by multiple methods e g accumulative average time delay and log transform to account for the impact of transport processes on chl a yu and shen 2021 the temporal variations of each of the 10 eof modes from satellite data were simulated using the neural network that takes external forcings as inputs for each mode the datasets including inputs and outputs were divided into two sub datasets with the first 75 of records for training i e 2011 2016 and the other 25 for prediction i e 2017 2018 the prediction sub dataset also known as the testing dataset do not involve in the eof and training process both the training and testing periods include years with annual mean streamflow into the chesapeake bay above and below median value of historical records based on usgs analysis see https www usgs gov centers chesapeake bay activities science freshwater flow chesapeake bay last accessed 8 16 2022 respectively the test data can be considered as an independent dataset in general data driven model always benefits from more data that covers more variabilities under different external forcing conditions considering the randomness in initialization of neural network parameters the outcome or prediction differs for each training even with the same inputs to address this uncertainty we trained the model 50 times for each mode and the ensemble mean of the predictions was used for model performance assessment details of the model description and procedures can be found in yu and shen 2021 simulating the satellite derived chl a in this study is a follow up of yu and shen 2021 to demonstrate the capability of the data driven model to predict high resolution large scale variations of water quality in coastal systems 3 results 3 1 in situ monitoring data the historical shipboard measurements of chl a show a similar pattern for mean standard deviation and relative standard deviation fig 4 all of them have a higher value in the middle upper bay specifically the region between 38 5n 39n and lower value in the lower bay and the upper most region close to susquehanna river outflow low values in the upper most region is likely caused by turbidity induced light limitation harding et al 1992 zhang et al 2021 in addition there are noticeable lateral variabilities with larger chl a at stations in shallow shoals e g cb3 3w cb4 1w cb4 2w cb4 3w rather than the deep channel furthermore the pattern is persistent between the 35 year and the 8 year period from 2011 2018 when satellite data are available fig s2 it is worth noting the high variability at these upper bay stations which may be attributed to the fluctuation of turbidity maximum zone induced by changing river discharge wind forcing and estuarine circulation sanford et al 2001 when the turbidity maximum zone shifts northward more stations will be exposed to a better light condition that favors the growth of phytoplankton stations within the turbidity maximum zone fluctuation area presumably have higher temporal variability of light condition and thus chl a concentration another interesting fact is the spatial heterogeneity in chl a seasonality indicated by climatological monthly means different from the conventional understanding that spring bloom dominates in chesapeake bay about half of the monitoring stations 18 of the 37 stations have a larger peak of chl a in summer months while 13 stations have a larger peak of chl a in spring months fig 4d near the bay entrance chl a has a weak peak in late fall or winter the spatially varying seasonality suggests that there are likely different limiting factors controlling algal bloom in different regions of the bay zhang et al 2021 in particular the summer bloom may be attributed to prolonged solar radiation and higher temperature that favor growth of different species e g dinoflagellates other than diatom strong stratification established following spring high flow murphy et al 2011 and bottom nutrient fluxes associated with seasonal hypoxia kemp et al 2005 during summertime could also contribute to the summer bloom 3 2 satellite data the 8 year mean of chl a satellite data show a similar spatial pattern as in the observation but with clearer and detailed lateral distributions fig 5 mean chl a increases from the bay mouth to the upper bay with noticeable larger values near both east and west shallow shoals compared to the deep channel fig 5a this lateral distribution is consistent with observation however some differences between the two datasets are also noticeable for instance near 39n the maximum mean chl a exceeds 20 μ g l in shipboard measurement while the value is lower in the satellite data variability of chl a indicated by relative standard deviation rstd has two high value regions one in the upper bay and the other in the coastal ocean fig 5c a relatively high variability is found in the middle bay right off the potomac river mouth which is not captured by the observational dataset primarily due to limited monitoring efforts in this region the high variability of chl a in this region may be attributed to hydrodynamic interaction between the mainstem and tributaries which is known to play a key role in exchange of soluble materials e g dissolved oxygen within the estuarine system kuo and neilson 1987 it is worth noting that the rstd of satellite data is relatively smaller than that from observational data largely because satellite data is averaged over a certain period 7 day and over a certain area 1 0 km in the case of gridded satellite data while observation data are based on instantaneous measurements once or twice each month and at a particular location compared to std which decrease seaward the rstd for both satellite data and in situ measurements decrease then increase from upper to lower bay the underlying reason is the much smaller mean chl a concentration near the bay mouth with the high resolution data we can map the timing of algal bloom for each grid the climatological monthly mean was calculated and the month with peak mean chl a was determined as the peak month the peak month exhibits interesting spatial patterns largely consistent with the chl a observations fig 5d spring peak occurs in the upper bay inside the lower potomac river off the potomac river mouth and near the james river mouth summer peak occurs mainly in the upper bay 38 39n and lower bay 37 37 5n spring peak regions share one key factor they are close to the mouth of major tributaries e g susquehanna potomac rappahannock york james and choptank rivers note that the spring peak does not occur near patuxent and chester rivers the other two major tributaries which coincides with the fact that these two rivers have the smallest mean river discharge among major tributaries the peak month seems to be regulated by discharge and corresponds to the time when riverine nutrients reach the given location timing of blooms are possibly induced by both transport processes and nutrient supply it will take 100 300 days for riverine material discharged from susquehanna river to reach the lower bay the transport time varies depending on flow regimes and wind field shen and wang 2007 the seasonality of satellite derived chl a is characterized by a clearly larger value in spring and summer compared to the other two seasons fig s3 fig 6 the maximum value in the mid summer or spring is about twice the value in the winter time two seasonal peaks persist throughout the entire bay and are most notable in the upper bay compared to middle or lower bay the two peak seasonal characteristic is more obvious from eof analysis fig 7 the first eof mode accounting for 32 4 of the total variance features positive spatial values throughout the entire bay meaning that bay wide chl a changes in phase the mode has clear seasonality with two peaks one in march and the other in july the second eof mode accounting for 24 7 shows out of phase variations between upper middle to upper bay region and the lower middle to lower bay region in this mode when high chl a occurs in the one region the chl a will be low in the other region suggesting the different seasonal variation between upper and lower bay the third mode features high variability in middle bay where the variation is opposed to both upper and lower bay the fourth mode represents the variability in the upper bay it can be expected that the response of each mode to external forcings will be different 3 3 simulation of chl a with data driven model the temporal variations of a limited number of principal components were simulated by the data driven model the training results of the first 5 modes 2011 2016 are shown in fig 8 model performance for the testing period 2017 2018 is more meaningful as input forcing and target variable in the testing period do not involve during training in any aspect the overall spatial pattern of modeled chl a anomalies relative to the long term mean and full signal agree well with that in satellite observed chl a see two example dates representing spring and fall in fig 9 the seasonal variability is well captured despite discrepancies in some regions more importantly the data driven model reproduces the strong contrast of chl a concentration between the bay and the adjacent coastal ocean as expected the data driven model no matter how well tuned will not capture every detail of chl a s spatial variations for instance the model captures the spring bloom e g in april of 2017 but the predicted magnitude is less than observation the underestimation could be caused by 1 uncertainty in the forcing data 2 inherent error in the neural network model and 3 error in the satellite data comparisons of time series at selected six stations fig 10 show that the model performance seems to decrease toward the upper bay in the lower bay e g station cb6 2 and cb7 3 the model well captures the seasonal and interannual variations of satellite chl a fig 10 model performance is also satisfactory in the middle bay however the model has difficulty reproducing the high variability in the upper bay e g station cb3 3c the spatial heterogeneity of model performance suggests that the upper bay chl a is less predictable compared to that in the lower bay error of satellite data due to high turbidity in the upper bay is likely a factor leading to the lower performance in that region first high colored dissolved organic matter in the estuarine turbidity maximum could decrease the accuracy of satellite chl a second phytoplankton tends to produce more chl a pigment per biomass when light is limited which complicates the relationship between external forcings and chl a the model performance varies spatially as indicated by the root mean square error rmse and the relative error re between predicted and observed chl a re and rmse show noticeable spatial heterogeneity with the worst performance in the eastern shoals between 37 5n and 38 5n and in the upper bay averaged over all the grids rmse is around 1 85 μ g l fig 11 4 discussion 4 1 in situ observation vs satellite data comparison between in situ observations and satellite data has confirmed the reliability of the satellite data in terms of several aspects including the lateral difference between shoals and the deep channel longitudinal decreasing trend from the upper bay to the lower bay and the peak timing however we acknowledge that there are noticeable differences in the magnitude of temporal variability between these two different datasets a major difference is in the bay wide averaged standard deviation of monthly mean chl a which is 8 8 μ g l in the in situ measurements compared to 3 3 μ g l in the satellite data the low variability in satellite data may be attributed to three possible factors 1 satellite data are 7 day averaged as opposed to instantaneous values with monthly sometimes bi monthly sampling frequency in cbp data 2 each record of viirs data represents an average of chl a concentration over a finite area e g 750 m 750 m in the viirs data thus variability of satellite based chl a concentration tends to be smaller 3 there is an inherent error when estimating chl a from satellite data both extremely low and high values are likely to be excluded when establishing the conversion function zheng et al 2015 both satellite data and in situ measurements demonstrate a remarkable difference between the deep channel and flanking shoals the underlying mechanisms can be further explored if given more information on nutrient salinity and temperature vertical profiles in both shoals and deep channel possible mechanism responsible for the lateral difference include 1 different flushing capacity between shoal and channel with water being more dispersive and moving faster in the mainstem xiong et al 2021 and thus less favorable for phytoplankton to aggregate when comparing to shoals tidal waters with stronger flushing capacity are known to have less chance of sustaining an algal bloom lucas et al 2009 qin and shen 2021 second the vertical mixing layer is about 10 m at the deep channel yu et al 2020 while the bottom of shoals is usually below this depth there is a larger chance that phytoplankton grows and accumulates to a thinner water column in shoals when light is available cai et al 2021 in another word the shoal water is less dispersive in the vertical direction and thus more productive third nutrient released from the seafloor is more accessible to phytoplankton in shallow waters because vertical mixing is much stronger in contrast the persistent pycnocline at the deep channel will limit the vertical nutrient flux from bottom to surface the satellite data highlight two notable chl a peaks spring and summer throughout the entire bay which is different from the in situ observations at mainstem stations where the water column is deep previous eof analysis reported in yu and shen 2021 based on in situ chl a concentration at 16 mainstem stations excluding stations at shallow shoals show that the first mode is featured with only one peak in march while eof analysis with satellite data clearly shows two comparable peaks the spring bloom is a well known ecological feature in chesapeake bay it results from the stimulus of spring high flow after snowmelt in watersheds that feed the major rivers harding and perry 1997 the summer bloom hardly revealed in in situ measurements is believed as a secondary bloom fueled by nutrients released from the sediment and recycled nutrients in the water column malone et al 1996 kemp et al 2005 this difference between satellite data and in situ measurements points to the important contribution of shallow shoals in the overall variance of chl a 4 2 dealing with data gaps there are several major challenges in high resolution simulation of water quality variables in both data driven and numerical models success of a numerical model relies on accurate prediction of local hydrodynamics and comprehensive parameterization of biogeochemical processes while for a data driven model the integrity of data itself both input forcing and target variable is particularly important one of the problems for the gscm derived satellite chl a data is substantial data gaps because the algorithm requires proper spectral shape in the input total absorption spectrum which is often not satisfied leading to the inability to identify feasible solutions zheng and digiacomo 2017 for the gscm derived viirs chl a data in chesapeake bay gaps are noticeable 20 even after a 7 day blending data gaps in coastal regions tend to appear more frequently in a specific season due to seasonal atmospheric and turbidity conditions for instance the bay wide satellite data show persistent high data gaps in april and may with gap percentages frequently exceeding 30 fig s1 it has been shown here that dineof provides a good estimation of the missing data fig 3b c one major advantage of dineof is that the interpolation does not need any prior knowledge of the correlation between data points beckers and rixen 2003 a large number of data points and record length at each data points are needed which is not an issue for satellite data dineof is therefore suitable for interpolating missing records in satellite data furthermore the auto detection of optimal number of eof mode provides an effective way to determine how many modes are needed to simulate in the data driven model broken stick method yu and shen 2021 suggests 33 modes are needed which is much more than the optimal number determined by dineof the dineof based optimal mode selection is more suitable for the data driven model considering the gappy nature of the satellite data it is worth noting that extreme high and low values from the original data are generally underestimated by dineof fig 3b which also contributes to the less variability of satellite chl a fig 5 4 3 higher frequency simulation for water quality variables in coastal waters the dominant frequency could be hourly daily or monthly depending on how quickly the underlying processes respond to external forcings for instance nutrient level in the lower bay typically responds to wind or river discharge induced perturbations with dominant frequency of several days in a much slower manner compared to temperature or salinity while the nutrient level is a key factor controlling the growth of phytoplankton variations of chl a concentration are subject to a variety of factors including water temperature vertical mixing horizontal dispersion light condition and abundance of predators these factors have a wide spectrum of frequencies ranging from hourly to monthly and need to be considered when simulating chl a ideally hourly or daily simulations are preferred when modeling chl a however several limiting factors make such high frequency simulations extremely difficult first despite daily frequency satellite data have large gaps if not blended over a period of multiple days inherent gaps in satellite data are from clouds atmospheric haze glint etc about 600 over the available 2000 days have data gaps less than 50 meaning only 30 of satellite images cover half of the bay second some external forcings are not available on daily frequency for instance nutrient loading data used in the model is available from usgs on a monthly basis using monthly nutrient input to simulate daily chl a variations will likely result in poorer model performance we conducted two simulations using monthly and daily chl a data and compared the model performance to that using 7 day average missing records in chl a data for these two simulations are also interpolated using dineof for daily data only those images with data gap less than 50 were used same forcings and model settings are applied for these two simulations the model has the best performance using monthly data while it has the worst performance using daily data fig s4 s5 monthly simulation has the smallest rmse and re when averaged over the domain of interest fig s4 specifically rmse in the upper bay is largely reduced compared to the 7 day simulation fig 11 for daily simulation rmse is also high in the upper bay but the rmse is smaller in tributaries including james and potomac river which results in a slightly smaller overall rmse when compared with the 7 day simulation fig s5 however the re in daily simulation is extremely high in several regions including areas near the bay mouth the upper bay and eastern shoals at 38n the overall model performance is shown in fig 12 re decreases from daily to 7 day and to monthly while the monthly simulation has the best model performance the monthly mean will omit a major portion of chl a variability using a 7 day average for chl a simulation is a balance of the model performance and data representativeness 5 conclusions analysis of recently available high resolution satellite data demonstrates the spatial heterogeneity of mean chl a concentration its variability and the peak timing patterns revealed by satellite data are consistent with that of long term monitoring data suggesting the reliability of the satellite data both satellite data and long term in situ measurements reveal higher mean and variability of chl a in shallow shoals than in the deep channel and different timing of seasonal peaks between the upper and middle bay different from in situ measurements the satellite data however highlight the existence of summer peak of chl a throughout the bay indicating the necessity of incorporating the shallow shoal for a bay wide analysis compared to low frequency shipboard measurements at a limited number of monitoring stations we believe satellite derived chl a could serve as an alternative reliable reference for numerical models performance assessment we also implemented dineof into the existing data driven model to address the issue of substantial gaps in satellite data sensitivity tests confirm that dineof is an appropriate way to fill data gaps with reasonable accuracy the model is applied to simulate high spatial resolution satellite based chl a concentration the overall model performance for predicting both spatial and temporal variation of chl a is satisfactory this study highlights the potential of using a data driven model for high resolution water quality

23811,previous literature has indicated that a spring cold sea surface temperature sst anomaly in the north tropical atlantic nta could induce an ensuing el niño event however observations show that this relationship is not always robust for example the spring cold nta sst anomalies are not necessarily accompanied by el niño events in the ensuing winter two types of cases are further classified for comparison a spring cold nta sst anomaly accompanied by an el niño tagged as nta el niño and a spring cold nta sst anomaly accompanied by no el niño tagged as nta normal statistical analysis indicates that pacific preconditioning acts an important role in modulating the nta sst and el niño relationship the zonal wind anomaly over the eastern subtropical pacific serves as an important medium linking the spring nta sst anomaly to the subsequent development of el niño and this part of the zonal wind anomaly in spring and summer is largely associated with the preceding winter tropical pacific sst anomaly the proposed mechanism is verified by two groups of coupled general circulation models cgcms runs with a weak and strong la niña condition compared with the strong la niña case under a weak la niña case in the previous winter the spring cold nta sst anomaly is more capable of modulating the development of the ensuing el niño event the present study suggests the importance of pacific preconditioning while forecasting enso with the precursor of the spring nta sst anomaly keywords el niño north tropical atlantic pacific preconditioning coupled general circulation model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the el niño southern oscillation enso refers to series of coupled processes between the ocean and atmosphere with maximal changes in the equatorial central and eastern pacific as the largest climate mode at the interannual time scale enso can influence the global climate through atmospheric teleconnection causing severe climate disasters wang et al 2000 mcphaden et al 2006 chen et al 2014 2018 2020 yang et al 2018 plenty of efforts have been made focusing on enso research during recent decades to understand enso s physical mechanisms improve enso prediction and assess its climate effects there are two views of enso occurrence wang 2018 one is an air sea self sustained oscillatory mode and the other is a stable mode in harmony with external forcing such as westerly wind bursts or madden julian oscillation events recently the importance of transbasin interactions in enso dynamics has been noticed cai et al 2019 wang 2019 chen et al 2021 previous studies ham et al 2013 jiang and li 2021 sun et al 2017 wang et al 2017 have indicated that spring sea surface temperature sst anomalies in the north tropical atlantic nta could influence enso variability for example ham et al 2013 pointed out that the sst anomaly in the nta during the boreal spring can prompt enso event occurrence during the following winter they suggested a subtropical teleconnection in which positive negative sst anomalies in the nta can cause an anomalous low level cyclone anticyclone over the northeastern pacific ocean and thereafter an anomalous low level anticyclone cyclone over the northwestern pacific during the next 3 6 months this circulation pattern is accompanied by anomalous easterly westerly winds over the western equatorial pacific and cool warm sst anomalies in the equatorial pacific finally a la niña el niño event during the following winter is excited in addition wang et al 2020 showed that the anomalous atlantic warm pool awp can also influence the enso activity through anomalous local hadley circulation between the awp and the tropical southeastern pacific this inter hemispheric process strengthens the south pacific subtropical high causing surface easterly trade wind anomalies both wind evaporation sst wang et al 1999 and bjerknes feedback bjerknes 1969 promote the occurrence of enso ren et al 2019 emphasized that consideration of the nta sst anomaly as a precursor in a statistical model could offer additional prediction skill scores for enso events previous studies e g ham et al 2013 jiang and li 2021 have addressed a significant physical relationship between the march april may mam sst anomaly in the nta and the following december january february djf sst anomaly in the tropical pacific however it should be noted that abnormal spring nta sst events do not necessarily result in an ensuing enso event fig 1 this finding prompts us to look at again the relationship between the spring nta sst anomaly and enso in the following winter in this study we will investigate the possible causes for different enso developments under a similar spring nta sst anomaly state a better understanding of the relationship between the spring nta sst anomaly and the subsequent enso can help improve enso forecasts 2 data and model for the observations monthly mean atmospheric data used in this study are from the national centers for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research reanalysis 1 ncep ncar r1 at a resolution of 2 5 2 5 kalnay et al 1996 noaa extended reconstruction sst version 5 ersst v5 huang et al 2017 is used to calculate the nta sst anomaly and enso index the nta sst anomaly is defined as the sst anomaly in the region of 0 15 n and 90 w 20 e the niño 3 4 index defined as the sst anomaly in the region of 5 s 5 n and 170 w 120 w is used to represent enso events because of the enso diversity we will only focus on the impact of spring cold nta sst anomaly on the subsequent el niño event in this study the long term linear trend is removed from all data before further analyses years 1 and 0 refer respectively to the preceding developing years of an el niño event a set of numerical experiments are performed in this study with the community earth system model version 1 2 2 cesm1 2 2 hurrell et al 2013 from the national center for atmospheric research it has been demonstrated that cesm has good performance in simulating the present day climate especially for enso fasullo 2020 the atmospheric component of cesm is cam4 which has 96 latitudes and 144 longitudes on a finite volume grid and 26 hybrid levels in the vertical the ocean model is a version of the parallel ocean program pop with 1 horizontal resolution and enhanced meridional resolution in the tropics 1 3 and with 60 vertical levels 3 results 3 1 different sst evolution under different pacific preconditioning as mentioned by ham et al 2013 the nta sst anomaly during boreal spring plays an important role in triggering the occurrence of enso events nevertheless in some cases the nta sst anomaly cannot act as an indicator for el niño here fig 1 shows the scatterplots of the spring mam nta sst anomaly and the subsequent winter djf niño 3 4 index the corresponding correlation coefficient is 0 23 exceeding the 95 significance test however it is detected that their relationship is not always stable and there are always exceptions when 0 75 standard deviation is chosen as a threshold for the significant mam nta sst anomaly the abnormal events are marked in bold in fig 1 and two types of nta sst enso relationships are classified the first type in blue dots referred to as nta el niño 1968 1972 1976 1986 1991 1994 2009 2018 is consistent with previous results indicated by ham et al 2013 and wang et al 2017 the second type in red dots referred to as nta normal 1971 1974 1975 1985 1989 1999 2012 is inconsistent fig 1 the two types of cases are adopted for comparison in the following discussions to examine the difference in the evolution of the sst anomaly in the tropical pacific between the two kinds of cases we plot in fig 2 the composite maps of the seasonal sst anomaly and surface momentum flux from the previous winter d 1 jf 0 to the following early spring mam 0 summer jja 0 and autumn son 0 significant cold anomalies are displayed in the nta during spring in both types of cases fig 2b and 2f yet sst evolution in the pacific ocean exhibits apparently different features the type of nta el niño is followed by significant warm sst anomaly in the central to eastern tropical pacific in the subsequent autumn fig 2d which finally generates an el niño event in contrast the type of nta normal is characterized by neutral conditions in the central tropical pacific with cold sst anomaly maintained in the eastern tropical pacific fig 2h please refer to ham et al 2013 for the full description of the physical mechanism corresponding to the nta el niño cases anticyclonic atmospheric flow at the surface during spring emerges over the eastern pacific ocean fig 2b which in turn promotes the formation of the western pacific cyclonic flow at low level during the next season then westerly winds arise over the western equatorial pacific fig 2c that activate the equatorial pacific air sea interaction and then may trigger an el niño event in the subsequent winter however this regime does not work for the nta normal cases figs 2e h the low level anticyclonic anomaly does not appear over the eastern pacific ocean in the spring fig 2f accordingly the low level cyclonic flow and westerly winds do not develop over the western pacific fig 2g which is crucial for the development of el niño in the following winter chen et al 2015 the initial difference between these two cases comes from the pacific precondition during the preceding winter fig 2a and 2b the type of nta el niño is associated with neutral conditions or weak cold sst anomalies in the tropical eastern pacific while the type of nta normal is concurrent with a significant cold sst anomaly in the tropical eastern pacific this implies that the impact of the spring nta sst anomaly on the following el niño may be probably modulated by pacific preconditioning 3 2 the mechanisms of pacific preconditioning for modulating the relationship between spring nta sst and el niño the above sst evolution implies the role of tropical pacific preconditioning in modulating the spring nta sst influence on the ensuring el niño development it is well known that enso events can inspire pacific north american pattern wave trains to affect extra equatorial regions horel and wallace 1982 the pacific north american pattern passes northeastern subtropical pacific this means that pacific preconditioning could impact the ocean atmosphere coupled process over the subtropical pacific which serves as a key medium linking the spring nta sst anomaly to the subsequent development of enso since the nta sst is closely associated with the niño index guo et al 2021 partial correlation analysis is utilized to remove the influence of nta sst on el niño development according to the gill theory gill 1980 associated with la niña the anomalous northeasterly winds over the northeastern subtropical pacific and the anomalous easterly winds over the western pacific is generated these anomalous winds enhance the trade winds which maintain the east west sst gradient in the pacific so this sst wind pattern can persist from spring fig 3a to summer fig 3b which is consistent with chen et al 2022 these wind anomalies may largely suppress the westward propagation of rossby waves induced by the nta the key physical processes of anticyclonic low level atmospheric flow in the northeastern subtropical pacific are inhibited fig 2f this inference also echoes yeh et al 2021 who noted that the air sea interaction in the eastern subtropical north pacific may contribute to surface wind anomalies in the equatorial central pacific during the el niño onset season 3 3 role of pacific preconditioning in the enso evolution in cgcm the above statistical analysis suggests the possible role of pacific preconditioning on enso evolution the hypothesis is further verified using a coupled air sea model in this subsection the cesm hurrell et al 2013 is adopted to conduct a series of pace maker experiments the model is verified to be practical in reproducing enso the simulated enso is characterized by a maximum sst variation in the central eastern pacific fig 4a and a main period of 2 7 years fig 4b which is fairly similar to that in the observation as indicated by many previous studies e g deser et al 2012 fasullo 2020 the cesm is first integrated for 1000 years to remove climate drift an additional 200 years run was conducted as the control experiment in this study the external radiation forcing is fixed at the level of pre industrial then we choose a typical weak la niña event and a strong la niña event as the initial conditions two groups of numerical sensitivity experiments are carried out using the cesm1 2 2 the first group including a control run and a weak la niña run is designed to emphasize the modulation of weak la niña conditions to the el niño development in the control run the oceanic and atmospheric components of cesm are freely coupled the weak la niña run is conducted with the same configuration as the control run except in the nta region where a gaussian shaped negative sst anomaly fig 5 is imposed during spring mam the second group of numerical experiments is similar to those in the first group but consists of a control run and a strong la niña run each group of numerical experiments has 10 members and each member is integrated with different initial atmospheric conditions one set with a weak la niña condition i e weak cold sst anomalies in the tropical eastern pacific and another set with a strong la niña condition i e strong cold sst anomalies in the tropical eastern pacific these two groups use the same nta sst forcing the imposed sst experiments are accomplished by prescribed surface heat flux in the pop in which the restoring timescale is 2 days the ensemble mean of each set is used to demonstrate the different influences of pacific preconditioning on the relationship between the spring nta sst anomaly and el niño sst responses in the weak la niña run fig 6a 6c are similar to those in the type of nta el niño fig 2b 2d a westerly wind anomaly emerges in the north subtropical pacific during spring fig 6a then develops in the tropic western pacific during summer fig 6b this wind anomaly is favorable for the development of ensuring el niño events in winter fig 6c additionally inter hemispheric process suggested by wang et al 2020 is observed with strong westerly wind anomaly in the south subtropic pacific during summer fig 6b similarly sst responses in the strong la niña run fig 6d 6f are comparable to those in the type of nta normal fig 2f 2h this means that such north subtropic processes and inter hemispheric processes are suppressed in the strong la niña run for a further comparison fig 7 shows the ensemble mean of the niño 3 4 index for the weak la niña run and strong la niña run and exhibits remarkable difference in the weak la niña run spring nta sst anomaly forcing can cause nearly 1 5 c sst change in the tropic central and eastern pacific for the ensuing winter and this is conducive to the occurrence of el niño in contrast only 0 5 c sst change is generated in the tropical central and eastern pacific in the strong la niña run and this keeps the pacific in a neutral state in the following winter the model results confirm the observational analysis that the spring cold nta sst anomalies are not necessarily followed by el niño events in the following winter this suggests the importance of the pacific preconditioning when considering the role of nta sst anomaly in affecting enso 4 conclusion and discussion the present study identifies that the relationship between spring nta sst and ensuing enso is not always stable in some cases the nta sst anomaly cannot act as an indicator for el niño the possible causes are further investigated by classifying the nta sst enso relationship into two types of cases one type is a spring cold nta sst anomaly followed by an el niño event during the following winter i e nta el niño and the other is a spring cold nta sst anomaly followed by a neutral state in the subsequent winter i e nta normal pacific preconditioning is argued to play an important role in altering this relationship for the type of nta el niño when pacific preconditioning is in a state of weak la niña in the northeastern subtropical pacific the southwesterly surface wind anomaly induced by the atmospheric rossby wave response to the cold nta sst anomalies fails to balance the northeasterly surface wind anomaly forced by la niña the net southwesterly surface wind anomaly is conducive to the development of ensuring el niño events in winter fig 8a however for the type of nta normal pacific preconditioning of strong la niña could persist on generating a northeasterly wind anomaly over the northeastern subtropical pacific and an easterly wind anomaly over the equatorial western pacific which balances the northeasterly surface wind anomaly induced by the cold nta sst anomalies fig 8b finally an el niño event does not appear in the following winter the coupled model experiments are further adopted to verify the proposed regimes in the experiment of weak la niña conditions the spring cold nta sst anomaly triggers an el niño event however under the same nta sst forcing the experiment of strong la niña shows a neutral or weak la niña event the physical processes in model experiments are similar to the observations our result implies that it needs to consider pacific preconditioning as an important factor when forecasting enso with the nta sst anomaly it should be noted that enso is a complex phenomenon and can be affected by many processes there is still controversy about the impact of the tropical atlantic on enso jiang and li 2021 emphasized that the distribution of tropical atlantic sst rather than the sst in a single sea area exerted an important impact on the excitation of enso richter et al 2021 argued that the spring cold nta sst anomaly only provides a 20 contribution to the amplitude of typical el niño events zhang et al 2021 attributed the lead lag relationship between the nta sst and enso to enso autocorrelation thus the issue of the relationship between the nta sst and enso needs to be explored with long record of observational data and more state of the art model data in further research credit authorship contribution statement sheng chen conceptualization methodology software formal analysis investigation writing original

23811,previous literature has indicated that a spring cold sea surface temperature sst anomaly in the north tropical atlantic nta could induce an ensuing el niño event however observations show that

pacific preconditioning as an important factor when forecasting enso with the nta sst anomaly it should be noted that enso is a complex phenomenon and can be affected by many processes there is still controversy about the impact of the tropical atlantic on enso jiang and li 2021 emphasized that the distribution of tropical atlantic sst rather than the sst in a single sea area exerted an important impact on the excitation of enso richter et al 2021 argued that the spring cold nta sst anomaly only provides a 20 contribution to the amplitude of typical el niño events zhang et al 2021 attributed the lead lag relationship between the nta sst and enso to enso autocorrelation thus the issue of the relationship between the nta sst and enso needs to be explored with long record of observational data and more state of the art model data in further research credit authorship contribution statement sheng chen conceptualization methodology software formal analysis investigation writing original

23812,assessing the coastal water export rate is important for better solving the coastal environmental problems and developing environmental management strategies to investigate the water export rate and its spatiotemporal variation in the subei coastal water scw a subregion of the yellow sea this study applied water residence time rt as an indicator and studied the roles of tides wind and river discharge on the water export rate using numerical modeling and the rt adjoint method rt had an annual and spatial mean of 80 days but presented highly spatial and seasonal heterogeneity spatially high rt 100 300 days occurred in the nearshore region and its location varied in seasons temporally rt was the shortest in the spring 55 days longest in the summer 91 days and median 81 days in autumn and winter furthermore the seasonal rt mismatched the strength of residual transport velocity rtv at the current season but instead relied on the combined effects of rtvs in the current and next seasons additional sensitivity experiments revealed that tides greatly increased the rt the changjiang river runoff slightly decreased the rt while monsoon wind dominated the rt seasonal variation as highlighted by an idealized analytical framework increasing the magnitude ratio of the wind and tidal induced rtvs could amplify the rt seasonal variability ecologically the shortest rt in spring might promote the rapid expansion of macroalgal blooms originating from the scw into offshore waters thereby contributing to green tide occurrence in the yellow sea therefore the seasonality of rt should be considered in coastal management and scientific planning keywords subei coastal water residence time transport timescales adjoint method residual current 1 introduction coastal water connects the land and ocean due to the high productivity and species diversity coastal water provides various beneficial services for humans costanza et al 1997 and is one of the most important areas of oceans from human perspective it also serves as filters removing pollutants and other land derived materials before they entering the ocean ferreira et al 2017 however densely land based human activities have led to severe environmental degradation in the coastal zone in present major coastal environmental problems and marine ecosystem challenges are worldwide such as coastal eutrophication coastal hypoxia heavy metals and emerging pollutants due to coastal exploitations lu et al 2018 the water export rate of coastal water determines the rate of water and material transport from land to ocean which is very important for understanding marine environmental problems and biogeochemical processes e g sun et al 2020 lucas and deleersnijder 2020 qin and shen 2021 for example a fast water export rate facilitates self purification and alleviates coastal pollution and eutrophication jickells 1998 thus it is of great significance to quantify the coastal water export rate and its variability for better understanding the coastal environmental problems and the marine ecosystem challenges meanwhile understanding the water export rate is important for improving environmental management strategies in coastal areas grifoll et al 2013 ocean dynamics determine the transport process and export rate of seawater wolanski 2007 however the actual dynamic in a realistic ocean is very complicated making it difficult to quantify the water transport or export rate directly from flow field therefore it is necessary to introduce auxiliary variables that reflect the water export rate in a target region deleersnijder et al 2001 lucas and deleersnijder 2020 water residence time rt is a parameter serving for this purpose rt is defined as the time taken by a particle to leave a water body or defined region of interest bolin and rodhe 1973 takeoka 1984 lucas and deleersnijder 2020 which is a suitable timescale for quantifying the water export rate e g lin et al 2020 according to the definition a longer rt means a slower water export the magnitude of rt can provide reference for the exchange rate of nutrients in the seawater and the growth rate of phytoplankton which are important for knowing the formation mechanism of water eutrophication and algal blooms e g lucas et al 2009 lillebø et al 2005 thus rt of oceans has been widely investigated especially in semi enclosed regions such as bays and estuaries e g du and shen 2016 gong et al 2008 meyers et al 2017 ranjbar and zaker 2017 sun et al 2014 yuan et al 2007 luo et al 2021 however there are few studies on the rt in open coastal areas the subei coastal water scw with a mean depth of approximately 15 m lies in the southwestern yellow sea fig 1 the flat coastline of scw makes it relatively open water however it exhibits several environmental problems including eutrophication and poor water quality ministry of natural resources of the people s republic of china 2018 wang et al 2021 the scw is the cradle of the well known green tide which is a large scale macroalgal bloom that occurs from spring to summer in the yellow sea liu et al 2013 studying the rt of the scw would be helpful for further understanding these environmental and ecological problems tides wind and changjiang river runoff are the major dynamic factors that influence hydrodynamics and water transport in the scw wu et al 2014 wu et al 2019 yuan et al 2017 xuan et al 2016 tidal rectification causes a tidal residual current which affects the mean flow in the scw xuan et al 2016 meanwhile the strong tidal current in the scw increases the tidal mean bottom resistance that modulates the wind driven current wu et al 2018 according to drifter trajectories yuan et al 2017 found that the subei coastal current flows northward under the southerly monsoon winds in summer conversely under the northerly wind forces in winter the currents flow southward yuan et al 2008 yuan and hsueh 2010 the changjiang river is one of the largest rivers in the world and its maximum discharge can reach more than 50 000 m3 s in the summer which induces a wide range of river plumes wu et al 2011 the expansion of the changjiang river plume is an important freshwater source for the scw and can affect scw hydrodynamics wu et al 2014 zhu and wu 2018 previous studies showed that the scw hydrodynamics is intricate and exhibits a significant seasonal variability which raises questions whether there are also significant seasonal variations in the water export rate in the scw and what roles of different dynamic factors on the seasonal variations this study aims to investigate the seasonal variability of the water export rate using rt as an indicator and to understand the roles of the three dynamic factors i e wind tides and changjiang river discharge on the water export rate in the scw the remainder of this study is organized as follows section 2 introduces the models employed for the hydrodynamic simulation and the adjoint method for rt in the scw section 3 discusses the rt in the scw and the effects of dynamic factors section 4 analyzes the residual transport velocity in the scw in order to understand seasonal rt variations and discusses the implications of the rt results a brief conclusion is given in section 5 2 models and methods 2 1 hydrodynamic model 2 1 1 model description the hydrodynamic model set up by guo et al 2003 and wang et al 2008 was used to simulate the flow field for scw this model was based on the princeton ocean model blumberg and mellor 1987 as shown in fig 1a the model domain covered the bohai sea yellow sea and east china sea and is discretized by orthogonal grids with a horizontal resolution of 1 18 and 20 vertical layers the model used the monthly mean climatological forcing of the sea surface winds heat fluxes river discharges and boundary currents for model validation we employed realistic daily forcing from the european center for medium range weather forecasts for fairly evaluating the model performance additionally rt computed from hydrodynamic results driven by monthly mean forcing presented a consistent seasonal variation with that driven from daily forcing see figure s1 in the supplementary materials meanwhile applying monthly mean forcing further saved computational coasts in a series of runs therefore hydrodynamic model results driven by monthly mean forcing were used in the rt model the tidal elevations of four predominant tidal constituents m 2 s 2 k 1 and o 1 were added at the open boundary to produce tidal motion in the model the modeled values of the water depth currents and diffusion coefficients were output at 30 min interval to drive the adjoint model of the rt in scw introduced in section 2 2 the model was verified in previous studies and has been used to study the interannual variation in the yellow sea cold water mass zhu et al 2018 and the water export rate of the eastern shelf seas of china lin et al 2020 to ensure the reliability of the model we further check the co tidal charts and compare the modeled water temperature and salinity with the in situ observation 2 1 2 model validation the scw is characterized by strong tides in which semi diurnal tides are predominant the modeled co tidal charts of the four major tidal constituents i e m2 s2 k1 and o1 were derived from a harmonic analysis fig 2 the tidal amplitude of m2 is larger than 1 m along the subei coast which is much larger than that of the other three tidal constituents the maximum tidal range in the scw was more than 5 m there is an amphidromic point for each tidal constituent at the offshore water of the scw and the location of the amphidromic points is in good agreement with the ocean atlas of the yellow sea chen 1992 the simulated tidal charts are also highly consistent with the observation based charts fang et al 2004 and those from different models e g figure 3 in xuan et al 2016 and figure 13 in wu et al 2014 the simulated water temperature and salinity are compared with the observed values during the yellow sea and subei coast cruises fig 1b the water temperature and salinity data in the western yellow sea were collected during four cruises conducted in may 2014 spring november 2014 autumn august 2015 summer and january 2016 winter respectively a conductivity temperature depth instrument ctd seabird 911 plus was used to measure seawater temperature salinity and water depth with a sampling frequency of 24 hz the data were averaged per meter and only the data at the surface middle and bottom layers were accessed and used in the validation in this study the subei coast cruise was conducted in april 2018 when only the water temperature and salinity at the sea surface were measured with a multiparameter water quality analyzer ysi due to the strong mixing there wei et al 2020 wu et al 2011 as shown in fig 3 the simulated water temperature and salinity were consistent with the observed data the correlation coefficients of water temperature between the model and observations in both the yellow sea and subei coast cruises were higher than 0 9 all the root mean square errors for the simulated water temperature were less than 1 94 c meanwhile the simulated salinity matched the observed data better r 0 8 in the summer when the changjiang river discharge was larger in the spring and autumn the salinity correlation between the model results and observations was relatively low r 0 47 the relatively large bias of the modeled salinity mainly occurred in the adjacent area of the changjiang river plume front and at the nearshore water figure s2 in the supplementary materials which is likely because of the high variability of the river plume and the exclusion of some small rivers along the subei coast in the model however the model captured the basic pattern of the changjiang river plume and its seasonal variability figure s3 in the supplementary materials and all the root mean square errors for the simulated salinity were less than 1 29 fig 3 in addition the model skill score ss which is defined as one minus the mean square error divided by the observed variance was further calculated to evaluate the model performance the ss for the water temperature and salinity are 0 93 and 0 22 for the yellow sea cruises and are 0 68 and 0 47 for the subei coast cruises respectively usually ss 0 2 suggests a good model performance allen et al 2007 therefore the model favorably reproduced the general hydrographic characteristics of the scw 2 2 residence time model there are three common methods for diagnosing rt including the particle tracking method remnant function approach and adjoint method the particle tracking method determines rt by recording the amounts of time particles spent in the domain of interest e g gong et al 2008 while the remnant function approach takeoka 1984 diagnoses rt by integrating the concentration time series of a tracer released at a certain time and location e g de brauwere et al 2011 however both the particle tracking and the remnant function methods cannot easily derive continuous spatiotemporal variations of rt because in this case particles or tracers need to be released at each model time step and grid cells of the domain of interest and a huge computational cost is required to run the model delhez et al 2004 du and shen 2016 lin and liu 2019a in order to address this issue delhez et al 2004 proposed an adjoint method to compute the rt in the framework of the constituent oriented age and residence time theory cart deleersnijder et al 2001 delhez and deleersnijder 2002 delhez et al 2004 the adjoint method can derive spatiotemporal variations of rt with a single backward model run which is appropriate to diagnose the continuous seasonal variability of rt in this study following takeoka 1984 the rt θ x t of a water parcel at location x and release time t can be expressed by integrating the tracer concentration in the control region in a forward model as follows 1 θ x t t r t d t where r t m t m 0 is the remnant function m 0 is the mass of the tracer initially released at location x and time t and m t is the tracer mass remaining in the control region ω at time t according to the adjoint method of delhez et al 2004 the θ x t can be computed using the adjoint equation expressed as 2 θ t δ ω x v θ k θ 0 where v is the three dimensional velocity field k is the diffusion tensor and δ ω x is the characteristic function of the control region ω and δ ω x 1 x ω 0 x ω the open boundary is assigned a homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition i e θ 0 which reflects the time required to exit the control region for the first time delhez et al 2004 delhez 2006 delhez and deleersnijder 2006 in addition to the rt the partial residence time prt and the exposure time et were also calculated for better understanding the residence time composition in different subregions of the control region and the influence of re entry processes on the transport timescale respectively the prt is defined as the amount of time that a water parcel spends in different subregions in the control region until its leaving from the control region lin and liu 2019a which can be also computed using the adjoint method according to lin and liu 2019a the adjoint equation for the prt is expressed as 3 θ ω i t δ ω i x v θ ω i k θ ω i 0 where δ ω i x is the characteristic function for subregion ω i and δ ω i x 1 x ω i 0 x ω i the prt equations used the same open boundary condition with the rt equation and no boundary conditions need at the boundaries between the subregions lin and liu 2019a et is defined as the total time that the water parcel spent in the control region with a consideration of all subsequent re entry processes delhez 2006 the et can be computed using the same adjoint equation as the rt except that no boundary conditions need to be prescribed on the open boundaries of control region ω the boundary conditions for the computations of the rt prt and et are summarized in table 1 in addition to quantify the influence of the re entry process on the water renewal timescale we calculated the return coefficient r e t r t e t which measures the portion of the exposure time fraction attributed to the re entry water de brauwere et al 2011 de brye et al 2013 more details regarding the rt et and prt models are provided in delhez et al 2004 and lin and liu 2019a based on the adjoint equations 2 and 3 the rt model established by lin and liu 2019a was used to diagnose rt variation in the scw which belongs to a submodule of the model marine environment research and forecasting model liu et al 2016 tang et al 2021 the equations are solved using the finite difference method with the same grids and layers as the hydrodynamic model the total variation diminishing tvd scheme with a superbee and muscl alternating flux limiter tvdal was used to discretize the advection term which has a smaller numerical error than conventional tvd schemes especially for long term integration lin and liu 2019b this model has been successfully applied in studies of the rt in the jiaozhou bay lin and liu 2019a the bohai sea luo et al 2021 the eastern shelf seas of china lin et al 2020 and the tributary bay of the three gorges reservoir cheng et al 2019 as shown in fig 1b the 30 m isobath was set as the open boundary a part of obc1 of the control region of rt because the 30 m isobath locates on the edge of the inner shelf slope which can be regarded as the boundary between the inner shelf and the middle shelf in the yellow sea to enclose the control region we added two more open boundaries at the north 35 n and south 31 8 n of the scw respectively red lines in fig 1b to calculate the prts the control region was divided into three subregions based on the water depth h h 10 m 10 m h 20 m and 20 m h 30 m the prts for these subregions were labeled prt1 prt2 and prt3 respectively as aforementioned the homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions were prescribed at the open boundary obc1 red lines in fig 1b to calculate the rt and prts whereas no boundary condition was prescribed at boundary obc1 to calculate the et in addition the boundary of the computational domain i e obc2 the blue lines in fig 1b was set to zero for the rt prts and et delhez 2013 which assumes that the water parcel never returns to the scw once it leaves obc2 the initial field of the model was set to zero delhez 2006 it is worth noting that the initial condition for the backward integration of the adjoint equation actually prescribed final values of the rt et or prt the final values of the rt et or prt fields are unknown therefore a spin up period is necessary which must be at least twice as long as the maximum value of the timescales according to delhez 2006 we integrated the models for three years and the integration times were longer than twice the longest timescales around one years in the control region after three years of model calculations the rt et and prts in the scw showed a stable seasonal variation and the results in the fourth year were saved for further analysis 2 3 residual transport velocity in coastal waters with strong tides the residual transport velocity rtv or residual current is a vital factor for determining subtidal and long term transport e g de kok et al 1970 nihoul and ronday 1975 prandle and player 1993 salomon and breton 1993 li and o donnell 1997 wu et al 2014 lin et al 2015 du et al 2018 thus the rtv in the scw was calculated and analyzed to understand the rt variation the rtv was calculated as follows 4 u r h η u d z h v r h η v d z h where ur and vr are the east west and south north components of the rtv respectively η and h denote the water elevation and mean water depth respectively and denotes the time average over one or several tidal periods as this study focused on seasonal variation in subtidal transport the average time was set to 90 days to obtain the mean rtvs in each season 2 4 sensitivity experiments to assess the impact of three dynamic factors i e tides wind and changjiang river runoff we conducted three sensitivity experiments for the three experiments the tides wind and changjiang river runoff were removed from the hydrodynamic model respectively then the hydrodynamic fields output from the experiments are used to drive the rt model in order to obtain the rt for the cases of no tides no wind and no changjiang river runoff hereafter termed as notide case nowind case and noriver case respectively finally the rt from three sensitive experiments were compared with that from the control run which included all the dynamic factors to investigate the impact of each dynamic factor on the rt to better understand the effect mechanism of the tides on the rt an extra experiment with only the tidal mixing considered in the no tide model was conducted hereafter termed as tm case in the experiment the tides were removed but the tidal mixing was retained in the dynamic model specially we ran a no tide model and replaced the turbulent mixing coefficients of the model by those saved from the control run during the model run 3 results 3 1 water residence time in the scw 3 1 1 seasonal variation as shown in fig 4 the rt in the scw showed a significant spatial temporal variation spatially rt was higher in the coastal region than in the offshore region the rt in the nearshore water in some seasons was more than 300 days implying that the pollutants released there at the season could stay in the scw for more than 10 months in winter and summer relatively high rts occurred in the middle of the scw in spring the nearshore rt was more than 300 days south of 33 n but lower than 100 days north of 33 n in autumn the pattern reversed with a lower value in the south but a high value in the north due to the strong mixing in the scw the rt was vertical homogeneous fig 5 thus only the vertical averaged results were analyzed below the daily mean of the spatially averaged rt in the scw showed apparent seasonal variation that the highest rt in summer was around two times of the lowest value in spring fig 6 the monthly mean rt in january was approximately 87 days decreased to 50 days from february to early may increased to approximately 100 days from june to early september and decreased to approximately 80 days in december consequently its annual mean was approximately 80 days while its seasonal mean was lowest in spring approximately 55 days highest in summer approximately 91 days and almost the same in autumn and winter approximately 81 days 3 1 2 influence of re entry process as shown in fig 6 the annual mean et averaged for the scw was approximately 150 days which was approximately double of the rt suggesting that the water export rate could greatly decrease when the re entry process is considered however the et was also highest in summer approximately 180 days and lowest in spring approximately 110 days showing a similar seasonal variation with the rt which suggests that the re entry process decreased the water export rate but has little effect on its seasonal variation as shown in fig 7 the return coefficient was larger in the offshore water than in the coastal water suggesting that the impact of the re entry process on the water export rate was more significant in the offshore water than in the coastal water further the return coefficient showed a similar seasonal variation with the rt and an inverse correlation with the rt spatial distribution meaning that the return coefficient was relatively low in the long rt region and high in the short rt region 3 1 3 partial residence time the prts that decomposed the rt into three subregions were shown in fig 8a the water in the scw had the longest retention in the subregion of 10 m h 20 m accounting for more than half of the rt the long retention in this subregion was associated with its large area the prts showed a similar seasonal variation as the rt with the shortest value in spring and the longest value in summer suggesting that the effect of the different subregions of the scw on the seasonal variation in rt was consistent the prts normalized by the volume of subregion nprt were shown in fig 8b nprts can be used to compare the water transport rates in different subregions lin and liu 2019 because higher nprts indicated lower water transport rates the water transport was relatively slow in the nearshore water h 10 m and fast in the offshore water 20 m h 30 m for the subregion of h 10 m the nprt in the summer was approximately twice that in the spring indicating that the water transport rate reduced by half from the spring to summer 3 2 effects of different dynamic factors on the rt using sensitivity experiments the effects of tides wind and changjiang river discharge on the rt were investigated the daily mean rt for the three sensitivity experiments and control run were shown in fig 9 the annual mean rt for notide was approximately 31 days which was much lower than that of the control run 80 days while that of the nowind and noriver cases were 88 days and 91 days respectively which were close to that of the control run these results suggested that tides had the most significant impact on rt when tides were removed from the model the mean rt in the scw decreased by 60 as compared to the control run indicating that the presence of tides greatly slowed the export rate of coastal waters which has been reported in the study on the eastern shelf seas of china by lin et al 2020 tides can modulate shelf currents by affecting water mixing and bottom friction however the rt in the experiment with only considering tidal mixing the tm case was very close to notide case and still much smaller than that of the control run fig 9 suggesting that the tidal mixing had a little impact on the rt this is mainly due to the weak stratification in the scw which results in less impact of tidal mixing on residual currents see e figures s4 and s5 in the supplementary materials as discussed in wu et al 2018 and lin et al 2020 tides could greatly weaken the wind driven currents in the scw by increasing the bottom resistance which can explain the higher rt in the control run in addition tides could also change the seasonal variability of the rt for instance the minimum daily mean rt for the notide case occurred in december rather than in the spring the annual mean rts for the nowind and noriver cases were slightly higher than that of the control run 80 days suggesting that the wind and changjiang river runoff facilitated water export in the scw however the effects of the wind and river runoff on the seasonal rt were different when the changjiang river was removed from the model the rt in spring increased whereas when the wind was removed the rt decreased in summer but increased in the other seasons in addition the seasonal variability for both the nowind and noriver cases decreased as compared to the control run these results suggested that wind and river runoff mainly influence seasonal variation of the rt which was a reasonable result because they both exhibited an apparent seasonal variation figs 1c and 1d 4 discussion the rt in the scw shows significant seasonal variation reaching a low value in the spring and a peak value in the summer to understand the seasonal variation in the rt and its dynamic mechanism we analyzed the seasonal variation in the rtv and water particle trajectories in the scw using the particle tracking method moreover we discuss the implications of the rt results for the coastal environment and ecology 4 1 seasonal variation in the rtv in the scw in coastal waters the rtv has been recognized as a vital factor for determining long term transport e g de kok et al 1970 nihoul and ronday 1975 prandle and player 1993 salomon and breton 1993 li and o donnell 1997 wu et al 2014 lin et al 2015 according to geyer and signell 1992 in a residual current dominated system the estimating residence time could reduce to an estimation of the advective time scale of the system i e l u where the l and u denote the magnitude of the spatial scale and residual velocity of the study zone respectively in this study the l of the scw is 300 km and the mean residual current is 0 05 m s figure thus l u is 70 days and is very close to the modeled mean rt value 80 days suggesting that the scw is closer to a system that the residual current dominates other processes e g tidal pumping or tidal dispersion could also play a role in water transport particularly near topography in the scw the terrain is relatively flat within the region of water depth 30 m the control region of this study therefore the residual current should be the dominant factor controlling the water transport in the scw herein the rtvs in the scw for the four seasons were calculated based on the flow field outputs of the model the rtv shows significant seasonal variation fig 10 which is consistent with the model results in previous studies e g xuan et al 2016 wu et al 2018 in winter the nearshore rtv is northward along the subei coast from the changjiang estuary to approximately 34 n because of the nearshore strong tides wu et al 2018 meanwhile under northerly wind the rtv at approximately 34 n veers southeastward in the offshore scw and induces cross shelf transport yuan et al 2008 yuan and hsueh 2010 in spring and summer the rtv was stronger than that in the winter and its direction in most areas was northward which could be related to southerly winds yuan et al 2017 finally the rtv in the autumn was weaker exhibiting a pattern similar to that in winter the seasonal variability of the rtv can to some extent explain the seasonal variation in the rt of the scw for instance the water flows northward in the spring and summer and thus the spring rt is lower in the north than in the south conversely in the autumn and winter water flows southward in the offshore scw inducing a lower rt in the south than in the north however the rtv also suggested the strong weak rtv does not necessarily corresponds to a short long rt for example the rtv fields in spring and summer are similar but the rt field are different in two seasons fig 4 because the rt in our study area is as long as several months the transport of water parcels released in summer is influenced not only by the summer rtv but also by the autumn and even winter rtvs this reflects the advantage of the rt in quantifying the water export rate which can summarize the complete and complex dynamics of a system in a single variable that quantitatively indicates the rate of water export 4 2 rt discrepancy between spring and summer the rtv results show that water transport in the scw is fast in both spring and summer however the rt in the scw in the summer is the longest and is approximately two times that in the spring to understand the significant difference between the rts in the spring and summer we released several natural particles whose movement are completely controlled by water flow and have no self sedimentation or floating in the central scw along the latitude of 33 5 n and tracked their trajectories for one year the particles were released at 0 clock in the first day of may and august i e in the middle day of spring and summer respectively the particles initially located at the middle layer as shown in fig 11 when released in spring the particles continued moving northward crossing the 30 m isobath and the transect at 35 n consequently they left the control region in a relatively short time conversely the particles released in summer had different trajectories although they first moved northward for 90 days these particles reversed to the south before they reach the boundary of the control region thus the particles released in the summer experienced much longer excursions in the scw which explains why the rt in the summer is much longer than that in the spring the seasonal variation in the rtv determined the different trajectories for the particles released in spring and summer respectively the persistent northward motion of the particles released in the spring is attributed to the constant direction northward of the rtv in the spring and summer however for the particles released in summer their trajectory eventually reversed to the south because of the reverse rtvs in autumn and winter meanwhile the rtv veer near 34 n in summer could play an important role on the reverse of the particles trajectories because it blocked further northward transport in the end of summer and allows returning transport in the coming autumn in addition the rtv in the autumn is much lower than that in the summer and spring fig 10 which delays the export of the water released in the summer 4 3 generation mechanism of rtv seasonal variability in the scw according to the particle tracking experiments the seasonal variation in the rtv directly results in different fates for water in different seasons thereby inducing seasonal variation in the rt tides wind and changjiang river runoff are three major dynamic factors influencing the rtv in the scw wu et al 2011 2018 xuan et al 2016 yuan et al 2008 therefore in this subsection we analyze the rtv components induced by these factors and its seasonal variation to determine the generation mechanism of rtv seasonal variability in the scw based on the rtv sensitivity experiment results we derived the three components of the rtv because the difference in the rtv between the nowind case and the control run was induced by the absence of the wind the rtv induced by the wind rtv wind can be approximately obtained by subtracting the rtv in the nowind case from that in the control run in a similar way the rtv induced by the changjiang river runoff rtv river can be approximately obtained by subtracting the rtv of the noriver case from that of the control run finally the tidal induced rtv rtv tide can be derived from an additional numerical experiment with no wind and no river runoff it should be noted that the rtv induced tides wind and river could not be separated completely from each other by the sensitivity experiments due to their nonlinear interaction here we assumed that the effect of the nonlinear interaction between the three factors on the residual velocity is weak than that of single factors as shown in fig 12 the rtv tide remained the same for each season fig 12e h flowing northward along the coast until approximately 34 n owing to the relatively strong tides in the nearshore water the rtv tide is stronger in nearshore area than in offshore area the rtv tide is mainly attributed to the stokes drift resulting from tidal stress xuan et al 2016 wu et al 2018 conversely the magnitude and direction of the rtv wind showed significant seasonal variation the rtv wind exhibited strong southward flows in autumn and winter and relatively weak northward flows in spring and summer fig 12i l under the influence of the east asian monsoon the wind over the scw is strong and northerly in autumn and winter becomes weak and southerly in spring and summer su and yuan 2005 the wind speed determines the strength of the rtv wind and the changes of wind direction induces the opposite rtv wind over the scw in winter and summer yuan et al 2008 2017 for each season the rtv river in the scw were northward and their magnitudes were much weaker than those of the rtv tide and rtv wind fig 12m p the rtv river is proportion to the discharge of the changjiang river and therefore is weaker in winter than in other three seasons based on the three components of the rtv we inferred that the consistent direction of the rtv tide rtv wind and rtv river in spring and summer induced a strong northward transport meanwhile when the rtv wind opposed to the rtv tide and rtv river in the autumn and winter there was relatively weak transport this causes an interesting phenomenon that the rtv in the scw is strong in spring and summer when the wind is relatively weak but weak in autumn and winter despite of the presence of relatively strong winds wind is an important factor influencing the water transport and exchange rates and wind direction has an important effect on the spatiotemporal variation in the water transport timescales e g liu et al 2012 du and shen 2016 luo et al 2021 this study highlights the importance of the directional consistency of the wind driven flow and tidal induced residual current on the coastal rtv and long term transport if the wind driven flow follows the direction of tidal induced residual current the wind will greatly facilitate water exchange in contrast when the two current is against with each other the wind to some extent weakens the mean flow 4 4 relationship between the rt and rtvs to further understand the seasonal variability of the rt in the scw the quantitative relationship between the rt and the rtv is derived as shown in fig 12 the magnitude of the rtv river in the scw is relatively small compared to the rtv tide and rtv wind to facilitate the derivation of analytical solutions we assumed that the water transport in idealized coastal water is only dominated by rtv tide and rtv wind and the roles of other dynamics processes on the water transport are negligible the rtv tide has no seasonal variation and thus its magnitude is a constant v t the rtv wind has a seasonal variation and can be expressed as v w cos 2 π t t where v w denote the maximum magnitude of the rtv wind and t is one year 365 days here and t denotes the day in a year here the direction of rtv tide is defined as positive and in this study the rtv wind is opposite to the rtv tide in winter and the same in summer thus the expression of the rtv wind has a minus sign in front of it the total rtv which determines the water transport should be the sum of the rtv tide and rtv wind and thus is expressed as 5 v t v t v w cos 2 π t t assuming the v is homogeneous in the coastal water and the spatial scale of the coastal water is l the rt at the day t should satisfy the following equation 6 t t r t v t d t l substituting expression 5 into eq 6 and solving the definite integral one can derive the following expression 7 v t r t t v w 2 π sin 2 π r t t t sin 2 π t t l the expression 7 can be transformed to the following expression 8 r t t π v w v t sin π r t t cos π r t 2 t t l v t the expression 8 gives us the analytic relationship between the rt and the rtvs in the idealized case according to model results the magnitude of the v t and v w is 0 05 and 0 04 m s in the scw the spatial scale along the shore of the scw is 300 km then using these values we can solve the rt in the expression 8 using the graphic method as shown in fig 13a the analytic solution of rt is close to the numerical model result though the peak of the analytic rt is later than that of the numerical model result the lag of the peak could be related to the missing of the rtv river and the effect of tide wind interaction on the rtv in the analytic derivation this simple expression can be considered to have reproduced the major mode of the rt seasonal variability the analytic solution of the rt suggests that the magnitude of the rt variability should be related to the v w v t i e the ratio of the magnitude of the rtv wind and the rtv tide as shown in fig 13b 13c when the v w increases decreases the seasonal variability of the rt will increase decrease in addition when the rtv wind is much smaller than the rtv tide the high rt will be delayed until winter fig 13c which can explain the pattern of the rt for the nowind case fig 9 the above analysis can be helpful for evaluating the seasonal variability of rt in other coastal water dominated by the tides and wind without complicated numerical simulation 4 5 implications for coastal ecology and environment since 2008 the world s largest trans regional macroalgal bloom also known as green tide has occurred annually in the yellow sea the green tide covers more than 80 000 km2 seriously affecting the environment and ecology of the yellow sea keesing et al 2011 liu et al 2013 the green tide is caused by the floating green algae originating from the jiangsu coast in april and may liu et al 2013 this floating green algae is then transported northward in the western yellow sea and reaches the shandong coast in august this study shows that the annual mean rt in the scw is approximately three months but the rt is the shortest in april and may which is approximately one and half months indicating that the water export rate in the scw is much faster in spring because of the rapid water export rate of coastal water in april and may the floating green algae can leave the scw sooner and enter the offshore water and form the algal blooms over the western yellow sea thus the short rt in april and may could be an important factor responsible for the rapid expansion of the macroalgal blooms in the yellow sea which suggests that the hydrodynamic could be a critical condition for the occurrence of the ecological problem in addition the rt results suggest that the water export rate in the scw has significant spatiotemporal variation which is very helpful for coastal environmental management based on the rt results environmental managers can develop strategies to mitigate coastal pollution for instance high rt periods indicate slow water export rates suggesting that pollutant discharge should be strictly controlled and even reduced at these periods to alleviate the marine environmental pressure the optimization method of environmental management strategies based on rt results will be discussed in future studies 5 conclusions using numerical modeling and the adjoint method of rt this study investigated the spatiotemporal distribution of rt in the scw and its control mechanism rt had an annual mean of 80 days and showed a significant seasonal variability the spatially averaged rt was the lowest in spring approximately 55 days and the highest in summer approximately 91 days the seasonality of the rt was related to the seasonal variation in the rtv in the scw and the rt magnitude in the current season was determined by the rtvs in both the current and next seasons the tides greatly increased the rt in the coastal water while the wind was the dominant factor for seasonal variation in the rt and the changjiang river runoff slightly decreased the rt the analytic relationship between the rt and rtv suggests that the magnitude ratio of the rtv wind and rtv tide determined the magnitude of the rt seasonal variability in a system dominated by wind and tides the rt results could be helpful for understanding the coastal ecological and environmental problems implying that coastal management and scientific planning should be conducted depending on the season which will be discussed in depth in our subsequent research credit authorship contribution

23812,assessing the coastal water export rate is important for better solving the coastal environmental problems and developing environmental management strategies to investigate the water export rate and its spatiotemporal variation in the subei coastal water scw a subregion of the yellow sea this study applied water residence time rt as an indicator and studied the roles of tides wind and river discharge on the water export rate using numerical modeling and the rt adjoint method rt had an annual and spatial mean of 80 days but presented highly spatial and seasonal heterogeneity spatially high rt 100 300 days occurred in the nearshore region and its location varied in seasons temporally rt was the shortest in the spring 55 days longest in the summer 91 days and median 81 days in autumn and winter furthermore the seasonal rt mismatched the strength of residual transport velocity rtv at the current season but instead relied on the combined effects of rtvs in the current and next seasons additional sensitivity experiments revealed that tides greatly increased the rt the changjiang river runoff slightly decreased the rt while monsoon wind dominated the rt seasonal variation as highlighted by an idealized analytical framework increasing the magnitude ratio of the wind and tidal induced rtvs could amplify the rt seasonal variability ecologically the shortest rt in spring might promote the rapid expansion of macroalgal blooms originating from the scw into offshore waters thereby contributing to green tide occurrence in the yellow sea therefore the seasonality of rt should be considered in coastal management and scientific planning keywords subei coastal water residence time transport timescales adjoint method residual current 1 introduction coastal water connects the land and ocean due to the high productivity and species diversity coastal water provides various beneficial services for humans costanza et al 1997 and is one of the most important areas of oceans from human perspective it also serves as filters removing pollutants and other land derived materials before they entering the ocean ferreira et al 2017 however densely land based human activities have led to severe environmental degradation in the coastal zone in present major coastal environmental problems and marine ecosystem challenges are worldwide such as coastal eutrophication coastal hypoxia heavy metals and emerging pollutants due to coastal exploitations lu et al 2018 the water export rate of coastal water determines the rate of water and material transport from land to ocean which is very important for understanding marine environmental problems and biogeochemical processes e g sun et al 2020 lucas and deleersnijder 2020 qin and shen 2021 for example a fast water export rate facilitates self purification and alleviates coastal pollution and eutrophication jickells 1998 thus it is of great significance to quantify the coastal water export rate and its variability for better understanding the coastal environmental problems and the marine ecosystem challenges meanwhile understanding the water export rate is important for improving environmental management strategies in coastal areas grifoll et al 2013 ocean dynamics determine the transport process and export rate of seawater wolanski 2007 however the actual dynamic in a realistic ocean is very complicated making it difficult to quantify the water transport or export rate directly from flow field therefore it is necessary to introduce auxiliary variables that reflect the water export rate in a target region deleersnijder et al 2001 lucas and deleersnijder 2020 water residence time rt is a parameter serving for this purpose rt is defined as the time taken by a particle to leave a water body or defined region of interest bolin and rodhe 1973 takeoka 1984 lucas and deleersnijder 2020 which is a suitable timescale for quantifying the water export rate e g lin et al 2020 according to the definition a longer rt means a slower water export the magnitude of rt can provide reference for the exchange rate of nutrients in the seawater and the growth rate of phytoplankton which are important for knowing the formation mechanism of water eutrophication and algal blooms e g lucas et al 2009 lillebø et al 2005 thus rt of oceans has been widely investigated especially in semi enclosed regions such as bays and estuaries e g du and shen 2016 gong et al 2008 meyers et al 2017 ranjbar and zaker 2017 sun et al 2014 yuan et al 2007 luo et al 2021 however there are few studies on the rt in open coastal areas the subei coastal water scw with a mean depth of approximately 15 m lies in the southwestern yellow sea fig 1 the flat coastline of scw makes it relatively open water however it exhibits several environmental problems including eutrophication and poor water quality ministry of natural resources of the people s republic of china 2018 wang et al 2021 the scw is the cradle of the well known green tide which is a large scale macroalgal bloom that occurs from spring to summer in the yellow sea liu et al 2013 studying the rt of the scw would be helpful for further understanding these environmental and ecological problems tides wind and changjiang river runoff are the major dynamic factors that influence hydrodynamics and water transport in the scw wu et al 2014 wu et al 2019 yuan et al 2017 xuan et al 2016 tidal rectification causes a tidal residual current which affects the mean flow in the scw xuan et al 2016 meanwhile the strong tidal current in the scw increases the tidal mean bottom resistance that modulates the wind driven current wu et al 2018 according to drifter trajectories yuan et al 2017 found that the subei coastal current flows northward under the southerly monsoon winds in summer conversely under the northerly wind forces in winter the currents flow southward yuan et al 2008 yuan and hsueh 2010 the changjiang river is one of the largest rivers in the world and its maximum discharge can reach more than 50 000 m3 s in the summer which induces a wide range of river plumes wu et al 2011 the expansion of the changjiang river plume is an important freshwater source for the scw and can affect scw hydrodynamics wu et al 2014 zhu and wu 2018 previous studies showed that the scw hydrodynamics is intricate and exhibits a significant seasonal variability which raises questions whether there are also significant seasonal variations in the water export rate in the scw and what roles of different dynamic factors on the seasonal variations this study aims to investigate the seasonal variability of the water export rate using rt as an indicator and to understand the roles of the three dynamic factors i e wind tides and changjiang river discharge on the water export rate in the scw the remainder of this study is organized as follows section 2 introduces the models employed for the hydrodynamic simulation and the adjoint method for rt in the scw section 3 discusses the rt in the scw and the effects of dynamic factors section 4 analyzes the residual transport velocity in the scw in order to understand seasonal rt variations and discusses the implications of the rt results a brief conclusion is given in section 5 2 models and methods 2 1 hydrodynamic model 2 1 1 model description the hydrodynamic model set up by guo et al 2003 and wang et al 2008 was used to simulate the flow field for scw this model was based on the princeton ocean model blumberg and mellor 1987 as shown in fig 1a the model domain covered the bohai sea yellow sea and east china sea and is discretized by orthogonal grids with a horizontal resolution of 1 18 and 20 vertical layers the model used the monthly mean climatological forcing of the sea surface winds heat fluxes river discharges and boundary currents for model validation we employed realistic daily forcing from the european center for medium range weather forecasts for fairly evaluating the model performance additionally rt computed from hydrodynamic results driven by monthly mean forcing presented a consistent seasonal variation with that driven from daily forcing see figure s1 in the supplementary materials meanwhile applying monthly mean forcing further saved computational coasts in a series of runs therefore hydrodynamic model results driven by monthly mean forcing were used in the rt model the tidal elevations of four predominant tidal constituents m 2 s 2 k 1 and o 1 were added at the open boundary to produce tidal motion in the model the modeled values of the water depth currents and diffusion coefficients were output at 30 min interval to drive the adjoint model of the rt in scw introduced in section 2 2 the model was verified in previous studies and has been used to study the interannual variation in the yellow sea cold water mass zhu et al 2018 and the water export rate of the eastern shelf seas of china lin et al 2020 to ensure the reliability of the model we further check the co tidal charts and compare the modeled water temperature and salinity with the in situ observation 2 1 2 model validation the scw is characterized by strong tides in which semi diurnal tides are predominant the modeled co tidal charts of the four major tidal constituents i e m2 s2 k1 and o1 were derived from a harmonic analysis fig 2 the tidal amplitude of m2 is larger than 1 m along the subei coast which is much larger than that of the other three tidal constituents the maximum tidal range in the scw was more than 5 m there is an amphidromic point for each tidal constituent at the offshore water of the scw and the location of the amphidromic points is in good agreement with the ocean atlas of the yellow sea chen 1992 the simulated tidal charts are also highly consistent with the observation based charts fang et al 2004 and those from different models e g figure 3 in xuan et al 2016 and figure 13 in wu et al 2014 the simulated water temperature and salinity are compared with the observed values during the yellow sea and subei coast cruises fig 1b the water temperature and salinity data in the western yellow sea were collected during four cruises conducted in may 2014 spring november 2014 autumn august 2015 summer and january 2016 winter respectively a conductivity temperature depth instrument ctd seabird 911 plus was used to measure seawater temperature salinity and water depth with a sampling frequency of 24 hz the data were averaged per meter and only the data at the surface middle and bottom layers were accessed and used in the validation in this study the subei coast cruise was conducted in april 2018 when only the water temperature and salinity at the sea surface were measured with a multiparameter water quality analyzer ysi due to the strong mixing there wei et al 2020 wu et al 2011 as shown in fig 3 the simulated water temperature and salinity were consistent with the observed data the correlation coefficients of water temperature between the model and observations in both the yellow sea and subei coast cruises were higher than 0 9 all the root mean square errors for the simulated water temperature were less than 1 94 c meanwhile the simulated salinity matched the observed data better r 0 8 in the summer when the changjiang river discharge was larger in the spring and autumn the salinity correlation between the model results and observations was relatively low r 0 47 the relatively large bias of the modeled salinity mainly occurred in the adjacent area of the changjiang river plume front and at the nearshore water figure s2 in the supplementary materials which is likely because of the high variability of the river plume and the exclusion of some small rivers along the subei coast in the model however the model captured the basic pattern of the changjiang river plume and its seasonal variability figure s3 in the supplementary materials and all the root mean square errors for the simulated salinity were less than 1 29 fig 3 in addition the model skill score ss which is defined as one minus the mean square error divided by the observed variance was further calculated to evaluate the model performance the ss for the water temperature and salinity are 0 93 and 0 22 for the yellow sea cruises and are 0 68 and 0 47 for the subei coast cruises respectively usually ss 0 2 suggests a good model performance allen et al 2007 therefore the model favorably reproduced the general hydrographic characteristics of the scw 2 2 residence time model there are three common methods for diagnosing rt including the particle tracking method remnant function approach and adjoint method the particle tracking method determines rt by recording the amounts of time particles spent in the domain of interest e g gong et al 2008 while the remnant function approach takeoka 1984 diagnoses rt by integrating the concentration time series of a tracer released at a certain time and location e g de brauwere et al 2011 however both the particle tracking and the remnant function methods cannot easily derive continuous spatiotemporal variations of rt because in this case particles or tracers need to be released at each model time step and grid cells of the domain of interest and a huge computational cost is required to run the model delhez et al 2004 du and shen 2016 lin and liu 2019a in order to address this issue delhez et al 2004 proposed an adjoint method to compute the rt in the framework of the constituent oriented age and residence time theory cart deleersnijder et al 2001 delhez and deleersnijder 2002 delhez et al 2004 the adjoint method can derive spatiotemporal variations of rt with a single backward model run which is appropriate to diagnose the continuous seasonal variability of rt in this study following takeoka 1984 the rt θ x t of a water parcel at location x and release time t can be expressed by integrating the tracer concentration in the control region in a forward model as follows 1 θ x t t r t d t where r t m t m 0 is the remnant function m 0 is the mass of the tracer initially released at location x and time t and m t is the tracer mass remaining in the control region ω at time t according to the adjoint method of delhez et al 2004 the θ x t can be computed using the adjoint equation expressed as 2 θ t δ ω x v θ k θ 0 where v is the three dimensional velocity field k is the diffusion tensor and δ ω x is the characteristic function of the control region ω and δ ω x 1 x ω 0 x ω the open boundary is assigned a homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition i e θ 0 which reflects the time required to exit the control region for the first time delhez et al 2004 delhez 2006 delhez and deleersnijder 2006 in addition to the rt the partial residence time prt and the exposure time et were also calculated for better understanding the residence time composition in different subregions of the control region and the influence of re entry processes on the transport timescale respectively the prt is defined as the amount of time that a water parcel spends in different subregions in the control region until its leaving from the control region lin and liu 2019a which can be also computed using the adjoint method according to lin and liu 2019a the adjoint equation for the prt is expressed as 3 θ ω i t δ ω i x v θ ω i k θ ω i 0 where δ ω i x is the characteristic function for subregion ω i and δ ω i x 1 x ω i 0 x ω i the prt equations used the same open boundary condition with the rt equation and no boundary conditions need at the boundaries between the subregions lin and liu 2019a et is defined as the total time that the water parcel spent in the control region with a consideration of all subsequent re entry processes delhez 2006 the et can be computed using the same adjoint equation as the rt except that no boundary conditions need to be prescribed on the open boundaries of control region ω the boundary conditions for the computations of the rt prt and et are summarized in table 1 in addition to quantify the influence of the re entry process on the water renewal timescale we calculated the return coefficient r e t r t e t which measures the portion of the exposure time fraction attributed to the re entry water de brauwere et al 2011 de brye et al 2013 more details regarding the rt et and prt models are provided in delhez et al 2004 and lin and liu 2019a based on the adjoint equations 2 and 3 the rt model established by lin and liu 2019a was used to diagnose rt variation in the scw which belongs to a submodule of the model marine environment research and forecasting model liu et al 2016 tang et al 2021 the equations are solved using the finite difference method with the same grids and layers as the hydrodynamic model the total variation diminishing tvd scheme with a superbee and muscl alternating flux limiter tvdal was used to discretize the advection term which has a smaller numerical error than conventional tvd schemes especially for long term integration lin and liu 2019b this model has been successfully applied in studies of the rt in the jiaozhou bay lin and liu 2019a the bohai sea luo et al 2021 the eastern shelf seas of china lin et al 2020 and the tributary bay of the three gorges reservoir cheng et al 2019 as shown in fig 1b the 30 m isobath was set as the open boundary a part of obc1 of the control region of rt because the 30 m isobath locates on the edge of the inner shelf slope which can be regarded as the boundary between the inner shelf and the middle shelf in the yellow sea to enclose the control region we added two more open boundaries at the north 35 n and south 31 8 n of the scw respectively red lines in fig 1b to calculate the prts the control region was divided into three subregions based on the water depth h h 10 m 10 m h 20 m and 20 m h 30 m the prts for these subregions were labeled prt1 prt2 and prt3 respectively as aforementioned the homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions were prescribed at the open boundary obc1 red lines in fig 1b to calculate the rt and prts whereas no boundary condition was prescribed at boundary obc1 to calculate the et in addition the boundary of the computational domain i e obc2 the blue lines in fig 1b was set to zero for the rt prts and et delhez 2013 which assumes that the water parcel never returns to the scw once it leaves obc2 the initial field of the model was set to zero delhez 2006 it is worth noting that the initial condition for the backward integration of the adjoint equation actually prescribed final values of the rt et or prt the final values of the rt et or prt fields are unknown therefore a spin up period is necessary which must be at least twice as long as the maximum value of the timescales according to delhez 2006 we integrated the models for three years and the integration times were longer than twice the longest timescales around one years in the control region after three years of model calculations the rt et and prts in the scw showed a stable seasonal variation and the results in the fourth year were saved for further analysis 2 3 residual transport velocity in coastal waters with strong tides the residual transport velocity rtv or residual current is a vital factor for determining subtidal and long term transport e g de kok et al 1970 nihoul and ronday 1975 prandle and player 1993 salomon and breton 1993 li and o donnell 1997 wu et al 2014 lin et al 2015 du et al 2018 thus the rtv in the scw was calculated and analyzed to understand the rt variation the rtv was calculated as follows 4 u r h η u d z h v r h η v d z h where ur and vr are the east west and south north components of the rtv respectively η and h denote the water elevation and mean water depth respectively and denotes the time average over one or several tidal periods as this study focused on seasonal variation in subtidal transport the average time was set to 90 days to obtain the mean rtvs in each season 2 4 sensitivity experiments to assess the impact of three dynamic factors i e tides wind and changjiang river runoff we conducted three sensitivity experiments for the three experiments the tides wind and changjiang river runoff were removed from the hydrodynamic model respectively then the hydrodynamic fields output from the experiments are used to drive the rt model in order to obtain the rt for the cases of no tides no wind and no changjiang river runoff hereafter termed as notide case nowind case and noriver case respectively finally the rt from three sensitive experiments were compared with that from the control run which included all the dynamic factors to investigate the impact of each dynamic factor on the rt to better understand the effect mechanism of the tides on the rt an extra experiment with only the tidal mixing considered in the no tide model was conducted hereafter termed as tm case in the experiment the tides were removed but the tidal mixing was retained in the dynamic model specially we ran a no tide model and replaced the turbulent mixing coefficients of the model by those saved from the control run during the model run 3 results 3 1 water residence time in the scw 3 1 1 seasonal variation as shown in fig 4 the rt in the scw showed a significant spatial temporal variation spatially rt was higher in the coastal region than in the offshore region the rt in the nearshore water in some seasons was more than 300 days implying that the pollutants released there at the season could stay in the scw for more than 10 months in winter and summer relatively high rts occurred in the middle of the scw in spring the nearshore rt was more than 300 days south of 33 n but lower than 100 days north of 33 n in autumn the pattern reversed with a lower value in the south but a high value in the north due to the strong mixing in the scw the rt was vertical homogeneous fig 5 thus only the vertical averaged results were analyzed below the daily mean of the spatially averaged rt in the scw showed apparent seasonal variation that the highest rt in summer was around two times of the lowest value in spring fig 6 the monthly mean rt in january was approximately 87 days decreased to 50 days from february to early may increased to approximately 100 days from june to early september and decreased to approximately 80 days in december consequently its annual mean was approximately 80 days while its seasonal mean was lowest in spring approximately 55 days highest in summer approximately 91 days and almost the same in autumn and winter approximately 81 days 3 1 2 influence of re entry process as shown in fig 6 the annual mean et averaged for the scw was approximately 150 days which was approximately double of the rt suggesting that the water export rate could greatly decrease when the re entry process is considered however the et was also highest in summer approximately 180 days and lowest in spring approximately 110 days showing a similar seasonal variation with the rt which suggests that the re entry process decreased the water export rate but has little effect on its seasonal variation as shown in fig 7 the return coefficient was larger in the offshore water than in the coastal water suggesting that the impact of the re entry process on the water export rate was more significant in the offshore water than in the coastal water further the return coefficient showed a similar seasonal variation with the rt and an inverse correlation with the rt spatial distribution meaning that the return coefficient was relatively low in the long rt region and high in the short rt region 3 1 3 partial residence time the prts that decomposed the rt into three subregions were shown in fig 8a the water in the scw had the longest retention in the subregion of 10 m h 20 m accounting for more than half of the rt the long retention in this subregion was associated with its large area the prts showed a similar seasonal variation as the rt with the shortest value in spring and the longest value in summer suggesting that the effect of the different subregions of the scw on the seasonal variation in rt was consistent the prts normalized by the volume of subregion nprt were shown in fig 8b nprts can be used to compare the water transport rates in different subregions lin and liu 2019 because higher nprts indicated lower water transport rates the water transport was relatively slow in the nearshore water h 10 m and fast in the offshore water 20 m h 30 m for the subregion of h 10 m the nprt in the summer was approximately twice that in the spring indicating that the water transport rate reduced by half from the spring to summer 3 2 effects of different dynamic factors on the rt using sensitivity experiments the effects of tides wind and changjiang river discharge on the rt were investigated the daily mean rt for the three sensitivity experiments and control run were shown in fig 9 the annual mean rt for notide was approximately 31 days which was much lower than that of the control run 80 days while that of the nowind and noriver cases were 88 days and 91 days respectively which were close to that of the control run these results suggested that tides had the most significant impact on rt when tides were removed from the model the mean rt in the scw decreased by 60 as compared to the control run indicating that the presence of tides greatly slowed the export rate of coastal waters which has been reported in the study on the eastern shelf seas of china by lin et al 2020 tides can modulate shelf currents by affecting water mixing and bottom friction however the rt in the experiment with only considering tidal mixing the tm case was very close to notide case and still much smaller than that of the control run fig 9 suggesting that the tidal mixing had a little impact on the rt this is mainly due to the weak stratification in the scw which results in less impact of tidal mixing on residual currents see e figures s4 and s5 in the supplementary materials as discussed in wu et al 2018 and lin et al 2020 tides could greatly weaken the wind driven currents in the scw by increasing the bottom resistance which can explain the higher rt in the control run in addition tides could also change the seasonal variability of the rt for instance the minimum daily mean rt for the notide case occurred in december rather than in the spring the annual mean rts for the nowind and noriver cases were slightly higher than that of the control run 80 days suggesting that the wind and changjiang river runoff facilitated water export in the scw however the effects of the wind and river runoff on the seasonal rt were different when the changjiang river was removed from the model the rt in spring increased whereas when the wind was removed the rt decreased in summer but increased in the other seasons in addition the seasonal variability for both the nowind and noriver cases decreased as compared to the control run these results suggested that wind and river runoff mainly influence seasonal variation of the rt which was a reasonable result because they both exhibited an apparent seasonal variation figs 1c and 1d 4 discussion the rt in the scw shows significant seasonal variation reaching a low value in the spring and a peak value in the summer to understand the seasonal variation in the rt and its dynamic mechanism we analyzed the seasonal variation in the rtv and water particle trajectories in the scw using the particle tracking method moreover we discuss the implications of the rt results for the coastal environment and ecology 4 1 seasonal variation in the rtv in the scw in coastal waters the rtv has been recognized as a vital factor for determining long term transport e g de kok et al 1970 nihoul and ronday 1975 prandle and player 1993 salomon and breton 1993 li and o donnell 1997 wu et al 2014 lin et al 2015 according to geyer and signell 1992 in a residual current dominated system the estimating residence time could reduce to an estimation of the advective time scale of the system i e l u where the l and u denote the magnitude of the spatial scale and residual velocity of the study zone respectively in this study the l of the scw is 300 km and the mean residual current is 0 05 m s figure thus l u is 70 days and is very close to the modeled mean rt value 80 days suggesting that the scw is closer to a system that the residual current dominates other processes e g tidal pumping or tidal dispersion could also play a role in water transport particularly near topography in the scw the terrain is relatively flat within the region of water depth 30 m the control region of this study therefore the residual current should be the dominant factor controlling the water transport in the scw herein the rtvs in the scw for the four seasons were calculated based on the flow field outputs of the model the rtv shows significant seasonal variation fig 10 which is consistent with the model results in previous studies e g xuan et al 2016 wu et al 2018 in winter the nearshore rtv is northward along the subei coast from the changjiang estuary to approximately 34 n because of the nearshore strong tides wu et al 2018 meanwhile under northerly wind the rtv at approximately 34 n veers southeastward in the offshore scw and induces cross shelf transport yuan et al 2008 yuan and hsueh 2010 in spring and summer the rtv was stronger than that in the winter and its direction in most areas was northward which could be related to southerly winds yuan et al 2017 finally the rtv in the autumn was weaker exhibiting a pattern similar to that in winter the seasonal variability of the rtv can to some extent explain the seasonal variation in the rt of the scw for instance the water flows northward in the spring and summer and thus the spring rt is lower in the north than in the south conversely in the autumn and winter water flows southward in the offshore scw inducing a lower rt in the south than in the north however the rtv also suggested the strong weak rtv does not necessarily corresponds to a short long rt for example the rtv fields in spring and summer are similar but the rt field are different in two seasons fig 4 because the rt in our study area is as long as several months the transport of water parcels released in summer is influenced not only by the summer rtv but also by the autumn and even winter rtvs this reflects the advantage of the rt in quantifying the water export rate which can summarize the complete and complex dynamics of a system in a single variable that quantitatively indicates the rate of water export 4 2 rt discrepancy between spring and summer the rtv results show that water transport in the scw is fast in both spring and summer however the rt in the scw in the summer is the longest and is approximately two times that in the spring to understand the significant difference between the rts in the spring and summer we released several natural particles whose movement are completely controlled by water flow and have no self sedimentation or floating in the central scw along the latitude of 33 5 n and tracked their trajectories for one year the particles were released at 0 clock in the first day of may and august i e in the middle day of spring and summer respectively the particles initially located at the middle layer as shown in fig 11 when released in spring the particles continued moving northward crossing the 30 m isobath and the transect at 35 n consequently they left the control region in a relatively short time conversely the particles released in summer had different trajectories although they first moved northward for 90 days these particles reversed to the south before they reach the boundary of the control region thus the particles released in the summer experienced much longer excursions in the scw which explains why the rt in the summer is much longer than that in the spring the seasonal variation in the rtv determined the different trajectories for the particles released in spring and summer respectively the persistent northward motion of the particles released in the spring is attributed to the constant direction northward of the rtv in the spring and summer however for the particles released in summer their trajectory eventually reversed to the south because of the reverse rtvs in autumn and winter meanwhile the rtv veer near 34 n in summer could play an important role on the reverse of the particles trajectories because it blocked further northward transport in the end of summer and allows returning transport in the coming autumn in addition the rtv in the autumn is much lower than that in the summer and spring fig 10 which delays the export of the water released in the summer 4 3 generation mechanism of rtv seasonal variability in the scw according to the particle tracking experiments the seasonal variation in the rtv directly results in different fates for water in different seasons thereby inducing seasonal variation in the rt tides wind and changjiang river runoff are three major dynamic factors influencing the rtv in the scw wu et al 2011 2018 xuan et al 2016 yuan et al 2008 therefore in this subsection we analyze the rtv components induced by these factors and its seasonal variation to determine the generation mechanism of rtv seasonal variability in the scw based on the rtv sensitivity experiment results we derived the three components of the rtv because the difference in the rtv between the nowind case and the control run was induced by the absence of the wind the rtv induced by the wind rtv wind can be approximately obtained by subtracting the rtv in the nowind case from that in the control run in a similar way the rtv induced by the changjiang river runoff rtv river can be approximately obtained by subtracting the rtv of the noriver case from that of the control run finally the tidal induced rtv rtv tide can be derived from an additional numerical experiment with no wind and no river runoff it should be noted that the rtv induced tides wind and river could not be separated completely from each other by the sensitivity experiments due to their nonlinear interaction here we assumed that the effect of the nonlinear interaction between the three factors on the residual velocity is weak than that of single factors as shown in fig 12 the rtv tide remained the same for each season fig 12e h flowing northward along the coast until approximately 34 n owing to the relatively strong tides in the nearshore water the rtv tide is stronger in nearshore area than in offshore area the rtv tide is mainly attributed to the stokes drift resulting from tidal stress xuan et al 2016 wu et al 2018 conversely the magnitude and direction of the rtv wind showed significant seasonal variation the rtv wind exhibited strong southward flows in autumn and winter and relatively weak northward flows in spring and summer fig 12i l under the influence of the east asian monsoon the wind over the scw is strong and northerly in autumn and winter becomes weak and southerly in spring and summer su and yuan 2005 the wind speed determines the strength of the rtv wind and the changes of wind direction induces the opposite rtv wind over the scw in winter and summer yuan et al 2008 2017 for each season the rtv river in the scw were northward and their magnitudes were much weaker than those of the rtv tide and rtv wind fig 12m p the rtv river is proportion to the discharge of the changjiang river and therefore is weaker in winter than in other three seasons based on the three components of the rtv we inferred that the consistent direction of the rtv tide rtv wind and rtv river in spring and summer induced a strong northward transport meanwhile when the rtv wind opposed to the rtv tide and rtv river in the autumn and winter there was relatively weak transport this causes an interesting phenomenon that the rtv in the scw is strong in spring and summer when the wind is relatively weak but weak in autumn and winter despite of the presence of relatively strong winds wind is an important factor influencing the water transport and exchange rates and wind direction has an important effect on the spatiotemporal variation in the water transport timescales e g liu et al 2012 du and shen 2016 luo et al 2021 this study highlights the importance of the directional consistency of the wind driven flow and tidal induced residual current on the coastal rtv and long term transport if the wind driven flow follows the direction of tidal induced residual current the wind will greatly facilitate water exchange in contrast when the two current is against with each other the wind to some extent weakens the mean flow 4 4 relationship between the rt and rtvs to further understand the seasonal variability of the rt in the scw the quantitative relationship between the rt and the rtv is derived as shown in fig 12 the magnitude of the rtv river in the scw is relatively small compared to the rtv tide and rtv wind to facilitate the derivation of analytical solutions we assumed that the water transport in idealized coastal water is only dominated by rtv tide and rtv wind and the roles of other dynamics processes on the water transport are negligible the rtv tide has no seasonal variation and thus its magnitude is a constant v t the rtv wind has a seasonal variation and can be expressed as v w cos 2 π t t where v w denote the maximum magnitude of the rtv wind and t is one year 365 days here and t denotes the day in a year here the direction of rtv tide is defined as positive and in this study the rtv wind is opposite to the rtv tide in winter and the same in summer thus the expression of the rtv wind has a minus sign in front of it the total rtv which determines the water transport should be the sum of the rtv tide and rtv wind and thus is expressed as 5 v t v t v w cos 2 π t t assuming the v is homogeneous in the coastal water and the spatial scale of the coastal water is l the rt at the day t should satisfy the following equation 6 t t r t v t d t l substituting expression 5 into eq 6 and solving the definite integral one can derive the following expression 7 v t r t t v w 2 π sin 2 π r t t t sin 2 π t t l the expression 7 can be transformed to the following expression 8 r t t π v w v t sin π r t t cos π r t 2 t t l v t the expression 8 gives us the analytic relationship between the rt and the rtvs in the idealized case according to model results the magnitude of the v t and v w is 0 05 and 0 04 m s in the scw the spatial scale along the shore of the scw is 300 km then using these values we can solve the rt in the expression 8 using the graphic method as shown in fig 13a the analytic solution of rt is close to the numerical model result though the peak of the analytic rt is later than that of the numerical model result the lag of the peak could be related to the missing of the rtv river and the effect of tide wind interaction on the rtv in the analytic derivation this simple expression can be considered to have reproduced the major mode of the rt seasonal variability the analytic solution of the rt suggests that the magnitude of the rt variability should be related to the v w v t i e the ratio of the magnitude of the rtv wind and the rtv tide as shown in fig 13b 13c when the v w increases decreases the seasonal variability of the rt will increase decrease in addition when the rtv wind is much smaller than the rtv tide the high rt will be delayed until winter fig 13c which can explain the pattern of the rt for the nowind case fig 9 the above analysis can be helpful for evaluating the seasonal variability of rt in other coastal water dominated by the tides and wind without complicated numerical simulation 4 5 implications for coastal ecology and environment since 2008 the world s largest trans regional macroalgal bloom also known as green tide has occurred annually in the yellow sea the green tide covers more than 80 000 km2 seriously affecting the environment and ecology of the yellow sea keesing et al 2011 liu et al 2013 the green tide is caused by the floating green algae originating from the jiangsu coast in april and may liu et al 2013 this floating green algae is then transported northward in the western yellow sea and reaches the shandong coast in august this study shows that the annual mean rt in the scw is approximately three months but the rt is the shortest in april and may which is approximately one and half months indicating that the water export rate in the scw is much faster in spring because of the rapid water export rate of coastal water in april and may the floating green algae can leave the scw sooner and enter the offshore water and form the algal blooms over the western yellow sea thus the short rt in april and may could be an important factor responsible for the rapid expansion of the macroalgal blooms in the yellow sea which suggests that the hydrodynamic could be a critical condition for the occurrence of the ecological problem in addition the rt results suggest that the water export rate in the scw has significant spatiotemporal variation which is very helpful for coastal environmental management based on the rt results environmental managers can develop strategies to mitigate coastal pollution for instance high rt periods indicate slow water export rates suggesting that pollutant discharge should be strictly controlled and even reduced at these periods to alleviate the marine environmental pressure the optimization method of environmental management strategies based on rt results will be discussed in future studies 5 conclusions using numerical modeling and the adjoint method of rt this study investigated the spatiotemporal distribution of rt in the scw and its control mechanism rt had an annual mean of 80 days and showed a significant seasonal variability the spatially averaged rt was the lowest in spring approximately 55 days and the highest in summer approximately 91 days the seasonality of the rt was related to the seasonal variation in the rtv in the scw and the rt magnitude in the current season was determined by the rtvs in both the current and next seasons the tides greatly increased the rt in the coastal water while the wind was the dominant factor for seasonal variation in the rt and the changjiang river runoff slightly decreased the rt the analytic relationship between the rt and rtv suggests that the magnitude ratio of the rtv wind and rtv tide determined the magnitude of the rt seasonal variability in a system dominated by wind and tides the rt results could be helpful for understanding the coastal ecological and environmental problems implying that coastal management and scientific planning should be conducted depending on the season which will be discussed in depth in our subsequent research credit authorship contribution

marine atmospheric boundary layer or wave boundary layer wbl plays an important role in the simulation of meteorological and oceanic conditions for various offshore engineering and application purposes in the past decades several field and laboratory measurements have shown that ocean surface waves have significant impact on wind stress e g larsén et al 2003 babanin et al 2018 chen et al 2019 meanwhile such impact has also been investigated in numerical models e g janssen 1991 moon et al 2004 chen et al 2020b for the improvement of the stress calculation algorithm and applied in coupled wind wave even ocean modeling systems for the study of wave impact to the wind simulations e g wu et al 2019 li et al 2021 while it is accepted that an improved wind stress results in improved wind and wave modeling the method of quantitatively incorporating the wave impact on wind stress in the atmospheric wave and ocean models has not been regarded as conclusive the methods for the calculation of wind stress can be characterized as empirical parameterization method e g edson et al 2013 physics based method e g janssen 1991 and more comprehensive wbl based method every method has its own features and limitations and it will be discussed as follows in atmospheric wave and ocean models wind stress is often parameterized by the roughness length z 0 and drag coefficient c d c d is mostly empirically expressed as a function of the 10 m wind speed u 10 large and pond 1981 yelland and taylor 1996 the roughness length z 0 is usually parameterized by the charnock relation charnock 1955 1 z 0 z c h u 2 g 0 11 ν u where 0 11 ν u is a smooth flow contribution in light winds smith 1988 with ν the viscosity coefficient and u the friction velocity z c h is the so called charnock constant and g the gravitational acceleration however synchronized measurements of turbulence and waves in the wbl reveal that the sea state has a significant impact on the wind stress from coastal water to open oceans geernaert et al 1986 larsén et al 2003 shabani et al 2014 edson et al 2013 an explanation is that waves steepen approaching the coast therefore it is generally seen that young waves are rougher than old waves e g donelan et al 1993 accordingly the wave related properties such as wave age or wave steepness are often included in the parameterization of c d or z 0 e g taylor and yelland 2001 drennan et al 2003 oost et al 2002 hereafter ty01 dr03 and oo02 for practical reasons these empirical parameterization methods were used widely in the atmosphere wave ocean and coupled models e g fairall et al 2003 zijlema et al 2012 liu et al 2011 fan et al 2012 wu et al 2017 feng et al 2021 though it has been reported by du 2017 that in coastal areas there are discrepancies over the applicability among these formulations apart from the empirical parameterization methods more direct coupling methods have also been developed these methods account for momentum conservation across the wbl by which the momentum loss from the wind equals to the momentum gained within the waves and currents and therefore we call it physics based method accordingly in the wbl the total stress τ t o t is composed of the turbulent τ t wave induced τ w and viscous stresses τ ν 2 τ t o t τ t τ w τ ν see for example janssen 1991 hereafter jans method in the wam model wamdi group 1988 however it has been reported by previous studies e g johnson et al 1999 jensen and cardone 2006 liu et al 2017 that jans can overestimate the wind stress in strong winds therefore physical process such as the spectral sheltering effect by which the growth of long waves absorb momentum from the airflow within the wbl and result in the decrease of the growth rate of short wind waves e g chen and belcher 2000 was included in the development of new physics based methods e g hara and belcher 2004 moon et al 2004 fan et al 2009 reichl et al 2014 hereafter rhg the rhg method has been studied by chen et al 2020b a and they found that the rhg method can capture the enhancement of wind stress due to the shoaling waves in shallow waters and during idealized tropical cyclones however the rhg method is only used for the calculation of wind stress for the atmospheric model while not for the wind input source function of the wave model reichl et al 2014 so that there is an inconsistency between the wind stress in the atmospheric model and in the wave model when using rhg method to overcome such inconsistency du et al 2017 2019 implemented a wave boundary layer model wblm in swan so that the same growth rate function is used for the calculation of both wind stress and wind input source function of the wave model in this study we use the modeling system from du et al 2017 2019 with the wblm implemented in the coupled ocean atmosphere wave sediment transport coawst modeling system warner et al 2010 as the coupling interface between wrf and swan for wind stress estimation a brief description of the wblm coupling interface is attached in appendix a as pointed out by du et al 2019 that the computational costs of wblm is about 1 2 times the other schemes however since the wrf model costs far more computational time than swan we can always find a proper process number for swan to make the two model component synchronous therefore the computation costs of wblm in the coupling system is similar to the other methods this wblm coupled modeling system hereafter wcpl has been used in larsén et al 2019 hereafter xl19 to reproduce hundreds of storms in the estimation of 50 year extreme wind over denmark in xl19 we showed that the wcpl provides better extreme wind estimations than using the atmospheric model only when validated with measurements however there are several topics that xl19 did not address how is the wcpl constructed and what are the detailed setups for all the model components what are the differences between the wblm calculated wind stress and the other methods in shallow waters during storms what is the overall difference between the wcpl and uncoupled methods on wind wave and wind stress simulations for the whole range of wind speed conditions and not only the storm conditions as in xl19 accordingly in this study we provide a detailed description of the wcpl regarding wind wave coupling aspects and investigate the effect of waves on wind stress simulations with various coupling methods including empirical parameterization jans and wblm with a focus on the coastal area during storms this will be done through analysis of 321 storms from xl19 from coupled and uncoupled simulations over the eastern north sea with a close up investigation of a storm case study in the west coast of denmark in addition we will evaluate the overall performance of the wcpl through analysis of z 0 c d wind speed and significant wave height h m 0 during 321 storms simulations 2 methods and measurements 2 1 model setup the experiments include a storm case study for the comparison of wblm with the other coupling methods ty01 dr03 oo02 and jans and a collection of 321 storms from xl19 with wblm coupled and uncoupled hereafter ncpl simulations the purpose is to evaluate the coupling method using wblm and the investigation of its impact to the coastal wind simulations during storms the case study is chosen from the 321 storms where we have the envisat advanced synthetic aperture radar asar observations of the sea surface backscatter over the shallow area in the west coast of denmark and the asar data suggests clear effect of the local bathymetry on the water surface fig 1c d this shallow water effect will be discussed in the next subsection the simulation period for this case is from 00 00 feb 22 2004 utc to 12 00 feb 24 2004 utc note that the different coupling methods empirical or physics based mentioned above are only applied to the one storm case study to investigate the sensitivity of model results to different stress computation methods to the collection of 321 storms only wcpl and ncpl are applied to demonstrate the importance of wind wave coupling the selection of the 321 storms and the detailed model setups can be found in xl19 here we mainly introduce the model setups related to coupling aspect the atmospheric model wrf v3 7 1 and the ocean wave model swan v41 01 within coawst v3 2 warner et al 2010 are used here the domain setups of the two models are the same shown in fig 1a the three nested domains i ii and iii have spatial resolutions of 18 km 6 km and 2 km respectively the original code of coawst is modified such that the data transfer between the nested wrf and swan models only happens between matching domains and grid points it means that wrf i ii and iii only transfers data to from swan i ii and iii respectively and there is no need for data interpolation between wrf and swan grids for wrf the physics options are the same as xl19 with the pbl micro physics long and short wave radiation and cumulus schemes chosen as mynn 3 0 nakanasi and niino 2009 thompson thompson et al 2004 rrtm iacono et al 2008 and kain fritsch kain and fritsch 1993 respectively the ncep climate forecast system version 1 and 2 cfsv1 and v2 are used for the boundary and initial forcing of wrf for swan the bathymetry is interpolated from the 0 125 arc min emodnet digital terrain model dataset the initial spectrum is simulated with the same model setups and forced by cfs winds for 36 h and all the boundaries of the outermost domain are set as closed in the spectrum space of swan the number of directional bins the lowest value and exponent of frequencies are set to 36 0 03 hz and 1 1 respectively in the wcpl experiment the maximum frequency is chosen as 10 05 hz for swan according to du et al 2019 as pointed out by du et al 2019 such high upper frequency limit is chosen not for its physical significance but for the numerical stability of wblm in very calm sea conditions meanwhile wblm only solves the active frequencies where the action density of the spectrum is positive and frequencies where the action density turns into zero is dynamically cut off to save computational time in the jans experiment a maximum frequency of 0 57 hz is chosen so that the model does not crash in the empirical parameterization experiments the komen et al 1984 source function package is used and the maximum frequency is the same as wcpl in the wcpl and jans experiments z 0 is calculated in the wind input source function of swan in the empirical parameterization experiments wave parameters including significant wave height h m 0 peak wave length l p peak phase velocity c p derived from swan are transferred to wrf for the parameterization of z 0 according to ty01 dr03 and oo02 as listed in table 1 note that these three parameterization methods were already implemented in the original code of coawst v3 2 while the jans and wblm methods are new in the ncpl experiment z 0 is determined by the u 10 according to coare 3 0 fairall et al 2003 the time step of swan is set to 5 min for all the three nested domains and the data exchange rate between wrf and swan is also set to every 5 min wrf sends wind velocity at 10 m to swan and swan feeds back z 0 or relevant wave parameters to wrf note that wrf uses different time steps between the three domains the outermost domain of wrf uses a fixed time step of 37 5 s and a downscaling rate of 3 is applied to the other two domains 2 2 measurements for the study of shallow water effect we focus on the surrounding areas of horns rev hereafter hr fig 1c hr is a shallow water area with a water depth of 6 to 12 m about 15 kilometers away from the west coast of denmark at 09 50 feb 23 2004 utc a satellite scene is available from asar fig 1d the asar measures radar backscatter from the sea surface per area valenzuela 1978 here it is shown as the normalized radar cross section in 500 m grid cells radar backscatter is determined by the properties of capillary and short gravity waves which are largely wind induced valenzuela 1978 plant 1990 in this case the radar backscatter varies significantly over the bathymetry at horns rev this variation is likely caused by modification of centimeter scale waves due to tidal currents alpers and hennings 1984 or the breaking phillips 1988 refraction or bottom friction of surface waves in shallow waters we collected both wind and wave measurements within domain iii for model validation as listed in table 2 in the hr area locations of wind mast 2 and 8 m2 m8 and the wave buoy hb are shown in fig 1c in triangles and a circle respectively the wind speed is measured by cup anemometers at several heights at m2 and m8 locations of the other four atmospheric stations in domain iii are shown in fig 1b wave measurements have been conducted close to the atmospheric stations 3 results and discussions in this section first the spatial distribution of z 0 from the 6 coupled and uncoupled methods for the case study are analyzed then the modeled relation of c d with u 10 are examined in comparison with published measurement data finally the wcpl results during the 321 storms are evaluated with point measurements and the coupling impact to the modeling of wind speed in shallow waters is investigated in comparison with uncoupled results 3 1 spatial distribution of roughness length fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of z 0 over the hr area in model domain iii at 10 00 feb 23 2004 utc from uncoupled a empirically parameterized b d and physics based coupled models e f corresponding to the satellite scene of fig 1d here the pattern of the bathymetry can be recognized in most of the experiments except for the uncoupled modeling fig 2a the shallow water area with water depth d w 10 m is marked with black contour lines on each panel all the coupled results have larger z 0 over or in the downstream area of the shallow waters note that the winds are from the north see fig 1d the detailed spatial distribution of z 0 differs significantly between different approaches both of the two physics based methods namely jans and wcpl are more coherent with the satellite image than the parameterization methods in the shallow water areas the reason for this may be the physics based methods accounts for the whole spectrum information while some of the features in the spectrum may not be represented by the limited parameters in the empirical formulations for example the high frequency part of the spectrum which is very important for the wind stress calculation even though both jans and wblm are physics based methods the values of z 0 differ significantly from one to another because the two methods include different physics processes and use different numerical algorithms the magnitude of z 0 from wblm is close to the uncoupled results that is because the c d of wblm is concentrated near the uncoupled coare 3 0 curve as shown in fig 4 of the next section while the other methods have higher c d than them one striking feature in fig 2 is the sudden increase of z 0 in the downstream area of hr from the parameterization methods fig 2b d which does not exist in the physics based methods fig 2e f in these three parameterization methods z 0 are functions of wave parameters including h m 0 t p l p wave steepness h m 0 l p and inverse wave age u c p as shown in fig 3 considering that c p is calculated from l p t p it is natural to speculate that the sudden drop of l p fig 3c in the downstream area of hr is the main cause of the discontinuity of z 0 it indicates that the current algorithm in swan may fail to identify the peak wave length when the waves pass a shallow water area causing that typical parameterization methods may not be applicable in shallow water areas another drawback in these empirical formulations of c d or z 0 using l p t p or c p is that when energetic swell and local weak wind sea coexist t p becomes the peak frequency of the swell system and it actually has very loose connection with the local winds and therefore with the surface roughness and wind stress thus the applicability of such empirical formulations becomes questionable in confusing sea states 3 2 drag coefficient in this section c d as a function of u 10 from the case study and the 321 storms using wblm has been examined with measurements from different water bodies these measurements include the c d u 10 relation from coare 3 0 experiment fairall et al 2003 soloviev et al 2014 edson et al 2007 donelan et al 2004 and the parameterization of zijlema et al 2012 c d of domain iii from 06 00 feb 22 2004 utc to 06 00 feb 24 2004 is plotted against u 10 in fig 4 on top of the measurements from the literature the modeled samples are taken every 1 h the strongest winds during this case reaches about 20 m s 1 note that in fig 4f the c d u 10 relation from the wcpl simulation of all the 321 storms are also included presented as gray background color for the validation of c d over a broader range of wind speed and sea state with u 10 reaching 35 m s 1 for the parameterization of ty01 dr02 oo03 a lower limit of z 0 1 59 1 0 5 m is applied in the original code of coawst v3 2 which is about 9 43 1 0 3 for c d as shown in fig 4b d it is difficult to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of c d from different methods because there is big uncertainties in the measured values of c d from different approaches and different measurement studies show different values in the literature therefore we mainly focus on the main trend of the modeled c d u 10 relation and investigate its distribution for each wind speed for the uncoupled experiment c d is parameterized as a function of u 10 the modeled c d u 10 relation mainly overlaps with the parameterized curve while for the coupled experiments c d is scattered at each u 10 by taking into account of the wave impact in the oo02 and jans method c d increases faster with u 10 than the other methods and overestimates c d at high wind speeds e g u 10 10 ms 1 the distribution of c d at each u 10 is wider and more uniform for the parameterization methods than the physics based methods the c d u 10 relation from wcpl agrees best with the main trend of the measurement data in comparison with the other coupled methods in comparison with the uncoupled method the c d from wcpl mainly concentrated around the parameterization curve of coare 3 0 and the distribution of c d at each wind speed agrees well with the range of measurement data not only for the case study but also for the 321 storms with wind speed up to about 35 ms 1 3 3 the impact of coupling on coastal wind fig 5 shows the average values of z 0 and u 10 larger than 15 m s 1 from the wcpl and ncpl simulations of the 321 storms and the difference between the two experiments from all the simulations around hr area extracted from domain iii here the impact of bathymetry on the spatial distribution of both the z 0 and u 10 is clearly seen in the wcpl simulations in the shallow water area over hr with the water depth less than 15 m black contour line on each panel the time averaged z 0 simulated by the wcpl model is about 0 7 1 0 3 m larger than ncpl such enhancement of z 0 causes a decrease of u 10 larger than 15 m s 1 by about 0 3 m s 1 which corresponds to 2 3 4 overall model performance the wind speed u and the significant wave height h m 0 measurements at stations within domain iii as shown in fig 1b 1c are used to validate the wcpl model during the simulation of the 321 storms fig 6 shows the scatter plot of the measured and modeled u and h m 0 at all the stations during the 321 storms most of the simulated u and h m 0 at all the stations are centered in the 1 1 line in comparison with measurements the overall correlation coefficients coef root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae between the model and observation for u and h m 0 as defined in appendix b are 85 3 and 92 9 2 40 ms 1 and 0 44 m 1 74 ms 1 and 0 32 m respectively the results indicate that wblm is suitable to be used in both wave models and wind wave coupling systems finally we extracted all the modeled hourly wind speed data at height 15 30 45 and 62 m for m2 and 27 37 47 57 67 77 87 and 97 m for m8 when the measurement data are available and larger than 15 ms 1 during the 321 storms which resulted in 123 storms for m2 and 82 storms for m8 respectively the statistics of the mean bias bias rmse coef and scatter index si as defined in appendix b are listed in table 3 meanwhile the unbiased root mean square difference rmsd the standard deviation std and coef are shown in the taylor diagram in fig 7 both ncpl and wcpl result in negative bias at m2 while positive bias at m8 the bias of wcpl at m8 is close to ncpl but at m2 the negative bias of wcpl is obviously larger than ncpl considering that in fig 5 the mean wind direction is from the northwest m2 is right in the middle of the shallow water area where the wind speed is significantly decreased by the increment of z 0 while m8 is in the upstream area the wblm might slightly overestimate z 0 in shallow waters a possible cause to such an overestimation may be the lack of consideration of the sea spray effect in our current wblm e g xu and yu 2021 for the other statistics rmse coef si std rmsd the wcpl outperforms ncpl in both m2 and m8 at all levels 4 conclusions in this study we investigate the impact of wind wave coupling with the wave boundary layer model wblm method proposed by du et al 2017 2019 on the coastal wind simulations through a case study and a collection of 321 wind storm simulations in the case study experiments with the uncoupled coare3 0 method empirical parameterization methods ty01 dr03 and oo02 and the physics based jans and wblm methods are carried out for comparison in the storm collection 321 events in the north sea have been simulated with coupled and uncoupled methods in xl19 where the roughness length z 0 and drag coefficient c d are calculated by wblm and coare3 0 as a result the empirical parameterization methods fail to reproduce z 0 and c d in shallow waters during storms due to the failure of identifying the peak wave length or period and the parameters fitted from one dataset may significantly deviate from another on the contrary the physics based methods are free of these drawbacks as z 0 and c d are directly estimated from the wave spectrum based on the momentum conservation the jans method overestimates c d as the wind speed getting higher and the wblm method overcomes this problem by introducing the spectral sheltering effect and taking account of the kinetic energy conservation within the wave boundary layer it is shown that coupling the atmosphere model with a wave model is important in shallow waters especially for strong winds such as storms which causes on average about 2 difference in the surface wind field overall the wind and wave results from the wblm coupled simulation during storms are in good agreement with measurements from six meteorological wind masts and five wave stations in the north sea the modeled wind speeds at several heights of two coastal sites namely horns rev m2 and m8 during the 321 storms are further evaluated with measurements as a result the statistics of the wblm coupled results are slightly better than the uncoupled result but the difference between the two experiments are relatively small considering that in fig 4f the c d from wblm during the 321 storms gray color are mainly concentrated close to the coare3 0 curve for wind speed less than about 30 ms 1 it is not surprising that the statistics of wblm coupled results are close to the uncoupled one therefore we conclude that for most of the cases the uncoupled models are still reliable but for special conditions such as in shallow waters or storm conditions the wblm based coupling system is recommended for wind and wave simulations in order to ensure the momentum conservation across the wave boundary layer and thus to improve the result of

23813,a wave boundary layer model wblm that is applied as a wind input source function for the ocean surface wave model swan is further used in a wind wave coupling system for the wind stress calculation in the atmospheric model wrf the coupling system is used for the investigation of the modeling of coastal wind wave and wind stress during storms in the north sea in comparison with measurements and other studies in the literature the modeled magnitude and spatial distribution of the drag coefficient and roughness length by wblm outperforms the other four popular parameterization and physics based methods in addition the wblm coupling method produces a spatial variation of the surface wind speed in shallow waters affected by the bathymetry furthermore the wind and waves simulated by the wblm coupling method during 321 storms in the north sea are evaluated with measurements results show that wblm coupling method is reliable for the simulation of wind wave and wind

marine atmospheric boundary layer or wave boundary layer wbl plays an important role in the simulation of meteorological and oceanic conditions for various offshore engineering and application purposes in the past decades several field and laboratory measurements have shown that ocean surface waves have significant impact on wind stress e g larsén et al 2003 babanin et al 2018 chen et al 2019 meanwhile such impact has also been investigated in numerical models e g janssen 1991 moon et al 2004 chen et al 2020b for the improvement of the stress calculation algorithm and applied in coupled wind wave even ocean modeling systems for the study of wave impact to the wind simulations e g wu et al 2019 li et al 2021 while it is accepted that an improved wind stress results in improved wind and wave modeling the method of quantitatively incorporating the wave impact on wind stress in the atmospheric wave and ocean models has not been regarded as conclusive the methods for the calculation of wind stress can be characterized as empirical parameterization method e g edson et al 2013 physics based method e g janssen 1991 and more comprehensive wbl based method every method has its own features and limitations and it will be discussed as follows in atmospheric wave and ocean models wind stress is often parameterized by the roughness length z 0 and drag coefficient c d c d is mostly empirically expressed as a function of the 10 m wind speed u 10 large and pond 1981 yelland and taylor 1996 the roughness length z 0 is usually parameterized by the charnock relation charnock 1955 1 z 0 z c h u 2 g 0 11 ν u where 0 11 ν u is a smooth flow contribution in light winds smith 1988 with ν the viscosity coefficient and u the friction velocity z c h is the so called charnock constant and g the gravitational acceleration however synchronized measurements of turbulence and waves in the wbl reveal that the sea state has a significant impact on the wind stress from coastal water to open oceans geernaert et al 1986 larsén et al 2003 shabani et al 2014 edson et al 2013 an explanation is that waves steepen approaching the coast therefore it is generally seen that young waves are rougher than old waves e g donelan et al 1993 accordingly the wave related properties such as wave age or wave steepness are often included in the parameterization of c d or z 0 e g taylor and yelland 2001 drennan et al 2003 oost et al 2002 hereafter ty01 dr03 and oo02 for practical reasons these empirical parameterization methods were used widely in the atmosphere wave ocean and coupled models e g fairall et al 2003 zijlema et al 2012 liu et al 2011 fan et al 2012 wu et al 2017 feng et al 2021 though it has been reported by du 2017 that in coastal areas there are discrepancies over the applicability among these formulations apart from the empirical parameterization methods more direct coupling methods have also been developed these methods account for momentum conservation across the wbl by which the momentum loss from the wind equals to the momentum gained within the waves and currents and therefore we call it physics based method accordingly in the wbl the total stress τ t o t is composed of the turbulent τ t wave induced τ w and viscous stresses τ ν 2 τ t o t τ t τ w τ ν see for example janssen 1991 hereafter jans method in the wam model wamdi group 1988 however it has been reported by previous studies e g johnson et al 1999 jensen and cardone 2006 liu et al 2017 that jans can overestimate the wind stress in strong winds therefore physical process such as the spectral sheltering effect by which the growth of long waves absorb momentum from the airflow within the wbl and result in the decrease of the growth rate of short wind waves e g chen and belcher 2000 was included in the development of new physics based methods e g hara and belcher 2004 moon et al 2004 fan et al 2009 reichl et al 2014 hereafter rhg the rhg method has been studied by chen et al 2020b a and they found that the rhg method can capture the enhancement of wind stress due to the shoaling waves in shallow waters and during idealized tropical cyclones however the rhg method is only used for the calculation of wind stress for the atmospheric model while not for the wind input source function of the wave model reichl et al 2014 so that there is an inconsistency between the wind stress in the atmospheric model and in the wave model when using rhg method to overcome such inconsistency du et al 2017 2019 implemented a wave boundary layer model wblm in swan so that the same growth rate function is used for the calculation of both wind stress and wind input source function of the wave model in this study we use the modeling system from du et al 2017 2019 with the wblm implemented in the coupled ocean atmosphere wave sediment transport coawst modeling system warner et al 2010 as the coupling interface between wrf and swan for wind stress estimation a brief description of the wblm coupling interface is attached in appendix a as pointed out by du et al 2019 that the computational costs of wblm is about 1 2 times the other schemes however since the wrf model costs far more computational time than swan we can always find a proper process number for swan to make the two model component synchronous therefore the computation costs of wblm in the coupling system is similar to the other methods this wblm coupled modeling system hereafter wcpl has been used in larsén et al 2019 hereafter xl19 to reproduce hundreds of storms in the estimation of 50 year extreme wind over denmark in xl19 we showed that the wcpl provides better extreme wind estimations than using the atmospheric model only when validated with measurements however there are several topics that xl19 did not address how is the wcpl constructed and what are the detailed setups for all the model components what are the differences between the wblm calculated wind stress and the other methods in shallow waters during storms what is the overall difference between the wcpl and uncoupled methods on wind wave and wind stress simulations for the whole range of wind speed conditions and not only the storm conditions as in xl19 accordingly in this study we provide a detailed description of the wcpl regarding wind wave coupling aspects and investigate the effect of waves on wind stress simulations with various coupling methods including empirical parameterization jans and wblm with a focus on the coastal area during storms this will be done through analysis of 321 storms from xl19 from coupled and uncoupled simulations over the eastern north sea with a close up investigation of a storm case study in the west coast of denmark in addition we will evaluate the overall performance of the wcpl through analysis of z 0 c d wind speed and significant wave height h m 0 during 321 storms simulations 2 methods and measurements 2 1 model setup the experiments include a storm case study for the comparison of wblm with the other coupling methods ty01 dr03 oo02 and jans and a collection of 321 storms from xl19 with wblm coupled and uncoupled hereafter ncpl simulations the purpose is to evaluate the coupling method using wblm and the investigation of its impact to the coastal wind simulations during storms the case study is chosen from the 321 storms where we have the envisat advanced synthetic aperture radar asar observations of the sea surface backscatter over the shallow area in the west coast of denmark and the asar data suggests clear effect of the local bathymetry on the water surface fig 1c d this shallow water effect will be discussed in the next subsection the simulation period for this case is from 00 00 feb 22 2004 utc to 12 00 feb 24 2004 utc note that the different coupling methods empirical or physics based mentioned above are only applied to the one storm case study to investigate the sensitivity of model results to different stress computation methods to the collection of 321 storms only wcpl and ncpl are applied to demonstrate the importance of wind wave coupling the selection of the 321 storms and the detailed model setups can be found in xl19 here we mainly introduce the model setups related to coupling aspect the atmospheric model wrf v3 7 1 and the ocean wave model swan v41 01 within coawst v3 2 warner et al 2010 are used here the domain setups of the two models are the same shown in fig 1a the three nested domains i ii and iii have spatial resolutions of 18 km 6 km and 2 km respectively the original code of coawst is modified such that the data transfer between the nested wrf and swan models only happens between matching domains and grid points it means that wrf i ii and iii only transfers data to from swan i ii and iii respectively and there is no need for data interpolation between wrf and swan grids for wrf the physics options are the same as xl19 with the pbl micro physics long and short wave radiation and cumulus schemes chosen as mynn 3 0 nakanasi and niino 2009 thompson thompson et al 2004 rrtm iacono et al 2008 and kain fritsch kain and fritsch 1993 respectively the ncep climate forecast system version 1 and 2 cfsv1 and v2 are used for the boundary and initial forcing of wrf for swan the bathymetry is interpolated from the 0 125 arc min emodnet digital terrain model dataset the initial spectrum is simulated with the same model setups and forced by cfs winds for 36 h and all the boundaries of the outermost domain are set as closed in the spectrum space of swan the number of directional bins the lowest value and exponent of frequencies are set to 36 0 03 hz and 1 1 respectively in the wcpl experiment the maximum frequency is chosen as 10 05 hz for swan according to du et al 2019 as pointed out by du et al 2019 such high upper frequency limit is chosen not for its physical significance but for the numerical stability of wblm in very calm sea conditions meanwhile wblm only solves the active frequencies where the action density of the spectrum is positive and frequencies where the action density turns into zero is dynamically cut off to save computational time in the jans experiment a maximum frequency of 0 57 hz is chosen so that the model does not crash in the empirical parameterization experiments the komen et al 1984 source function package is used and the maximum frequency is the same as wcpl in the wcpl and jans experiments z 0 is calculated in the wind input source function of swan in the empirical parameterization experiments wave parameters including significant wave height h m 0 peak wave length l p peak phase velocity c p derived from swan are transferred to wrf for the parameterization of z 0 according to ty01 dr03 and oo02 as listed in table 1 note that these three parameterization methods were already implemented in the original code of coawst v3 2 while the jans and wblm methods are new in the ncpl experiment z 0 is determined by the u 10 according to coare 3 0 fairall et al 2003 the time step of swan is set to 5 min for all the three nested domains and the data exchange rate between wrf and swan is also set to every 5 min wrf sends wind velocity at 10 m to swan and swan feeds back z 0 or relevant wave parameters to wrf note that wrf uses different time steps between the three domains the outermost domain of wrf uses a fixed time step of 37 5 s and a downscaling rate of 3 is applied to the other two domains 2 2 measurements for the study of shallow water effect we focus on the surrounding areas of horns rev hereafter hr fig 1c hr is a shallow water area with a water depth of 6 to 12 m about 15 kilometers away from the west coast of denmark at 09 50 feb 23 2004 utc a satellite scene is available from asar fig 1d the asar measures radar backscatter from the sea surface per area valenzuela 1978 here it is shown as the normalized radar cross section in 500 m grid cells radar backscatter is determined by the properties of capillary and short gravity waves which are largely wind induced valenzuela 1978 plant 1990 in this case the radar backscatter varies significantly over the bathymetry at horns rev this variation is likely caused by modification of centimeter scale waves due to tidal currents alpers and hennings 1984 or the breaking phillips 1988 refraction or bottom friction of surface waves in shallow waters we collected both wind and wave measurements within domain iii for model validation as listed in table 2 in the hr area locations of wind mast 2 and 8 m2 m8 and the wave buoy hb are shown in fig 1c in triangles and a circle respectively the wind speed is measured by cup anemometers at several heights at m2 and m8 locations of the other four atmospheric stations in domain iii are shown in fig 1b wave measurements have been conducted close to the atmospheric stations 3 results and discussions in this section first the spatial distribution of z 0 from the 6 coupled and uncoupled methods for the case study are analyzed then the modeled relation of c d with u 10 are examined in comparison with published measurement data finally the wcpl results during the 321 storms are evaluated with point measurements and the coupling impact to the modeling of wind speed in shallow waters is investigated in comparison with uncoupled results 3 1 spatial distribution of roughness length fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of z 0 over the hr area in model domain iii at 10 00 feb 23 2004 utc from uncoupled a empirically parameterized b d and physics based coupled models e f corresponding to the satellite scene of fig 1d here the pattern of the bathymetry can be recognized in most of the experiments except for the uncoupled modeling fig 2a the shallow water area with water depth d w 10 m is marked with black contour lines on each panel all the coupled results have larger z 0 over or in the downstream area of the shallow waters note that the winds are from the north see fig 1d the detailed spatial distribution of z 0 differs significantly between different approaches both of the two physics based methods namely jans and wcpl are more coherent with the satellite image than the parameterization methods in the shallow water areas the reason for this may be the physics based methods accounts for the whole spectrum information while some of the features in the spectrum may not be represented by the limited parameters in the empirical formulations for example the high frequency part of the spectrum which is very important for the wind stress calculation even though both jans and wblm are physics based methods the values of z 0 differ significantly from one to another because the two methods include different physics processes and use different numerical algorithms the magnitude of z 0 from wblm is close to the uncoupled results that is because the c d of wblm is concentrated near the uncoupled coare 3 0 curve as shown in fig 4 of the next section while the other methods have higher c d than them one striking feature in fig 2 is the sudden increase of z 0 in the downstream area of hr from the parameterization methods fig 2b d which does not exist in the physics based methods fig 2e f in these three parameterization methods z 0 are functions of wave parameters including h m 0 t p l p wave steepness h m 0 l p and inverse wave age u c p as shown in fig 3 considering that c p is calculated from l p t p it is natural to speculate that the sudden drop of l p fig 3c in the downstream area of hr is the main cause of the discontinuity of z 0 it indicates that the current algorithm in swan may fail to identify the peak wave length when the waves pass a shallow water area causing that typical parameterization methods may not be applicable in shallow water areas another drawback in these empirical formulations of c d or z 0 using l p t p or c p is that when energetic swell and local weak wind sea coexist t p becomes the peak frequency of the swell system and it actually has very loose connection with the local winds and therefore with the surface roughness and wind stress thus the applicability of such empirical formulations becomes questionable in confusing sea states 3 2 drag coefficient in this section c d as a function of u 10 from the case study and the 321 storms using wblm has been examined with measurements from different water bodies these measurements include the c d u 10 relation from coare 3 0 experiment fairall et al 2003 soloviev et al 2014 edson et al 2007 donelan et al 2004 and the parameterization of zijlema et al 2012 c d of domain iii from 06 00 feb 22 2004 utc to 06 00 feb 24 2004 is plotted against u 10 in fig 4 on top of the measurements from the literature the modeled samples are taken every 1 h the strongest winds during this case reaches about 20 m s 1 note that in fig 4f the c d u 10 relation from the wcpl simulation of all the 321 storms are also included presented as gray background color for the validation of c d over a broader range of wind speed and sea state with u 10 reaching 35 m s 1 for the parameterization of ty01 dr02 oo03 a lower limit of z 0 1 59 1 0 5 m is applied in the original code of coawst v3 2 which is about 9 43 1 0 3 for c d as shown in fig 4b d it is difficult to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of c d from different methods because there is big uncertainties in the measured values of c d from different approaches and different measurement studies show different values in the literature therefore we mainly focus on the main trend of the modeled c d u 10 relation and investigate its distribution for each wind speed for the uncoupled experiment c d is parameterized as a function of u 10 the modeled c d u 10 relation mainly overlaps with the parameterized curve while for the coupled experiments c d is scattered at each u 10 by taking into account of the wave impact in the oo02 and jans method c d increases faster with u 10 than the other methods and overestimates c d at high wind speeds e g u 10 10 ms 1 the distribution of c d at each u 10 is wider and more uniform for the parameterization methods than the physics based methods the c d u 10 relation from wcpl agrees best with the main trend of the measurement data in comparison with the other coupled methods in comparison with the uncoupled method the c d from wcpl mainly concentrated around the parameterization curve of coare 3 0 and the distribution of c d at each wind speed agrees well with the range of measurement data not only for the case study but also for the 321 storms with wind speed up to about 35 ms 1 3 3 the impact of coupling on coastal wind fig 5 shows the average values of z 0 and u 10 larger than 15 m s 1 from the wcpl and ncpl simulations of the 321 storms and the difference between the two experiments from all the simulations around hr area extracted from domain iii here the impact of bathymetry on the spatial distribution of both the z 0 and u 10 is clearly seen in the wcpl simulations in the shallow water area over hr with the water depth less than 15 m black contour line on each panel the time averaged z 0 simulated by the wcpl model is about 0 7 1 0 3 m larger than ncpl such enhancement of z 0 causes a decrease of u 10 larger than 15 m s 1 by about 0 3 m s 1 which corresponds to 2 3 4 overall model performance the wind speed u and the significant wave height h m 0 measurements at stations within domain iii as shown in fig 1b 1c are used to validate the wcpl model during the simulation of the 321 storms fig 6 shows the scatter plot of the measured and modeled u and h m 0 at all the stations during the 321 storms most of the simulated u and h m 0 at all the stations are centered in the 1 1 line in comparison with measurements the overall correlation coefficients coef root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae between the model and observation for u and h m 0 as defined in appendix b are 85 3 and 92 9 2 40 ms 1 and 0 44 m 1 74 ms 1 and 0 32 m respectively the results indicate that wblm is suitable to be used in both wave models and wind wave coupling systems finally we extracted all the modeled hourly wind speed data at height 15 30 45 and 62 m for m2 and 27 37 47 57 67 77 87 and 97 m for m8 when the measurement data are available and larger than 15 ms 1 during the 321 storms which resulted in 123 storms for m2 and 82 storms for m8 respectively the statistics of the mean bias bias rmse coef and scatter index si as defined in appendix b are listed in table 3 meanwhile the unbiased root mean square difference rmsd the standard deviation std and coef are shown in the taylor diagram in fig 7 both ncpl and wcpl result in negative bias at m2 while positive bias at m8 the bias of wcpl at m8 is close to ncpl but at m2 the negative bias of wcpl is obviously larger than ncpl considering that in fig 5 the mean wind direction is from the northwest m2 is right in the middle of the shallow water area where the wind speed is significantly decreased by the increment of z 0 while m8 is in the upstream area the wblm might slightly overestimate z 0 in shallow waters a possible cause to such an overestimation may be the lack of consideration of the sea spray effect in our current wblm e g xu and yu 2021 for the other statistics rmse coef si std rmsd the wcpl outperforms ncpl in both m2 and m8 at all levels 4 conclusions in this study we investigate the impact of wind wave coupling with the wave boundary layer model wblm method proposed by du et al 2017 2019 on the coastal wind simulations through a case study and a collection of 321 wind storm simulations in the case study experiments with the uncoupled coare3 0 method empirical parameterization methods ty01 dr03 and oo02 and the physics based jans and wblm methods are carried out for comparison in the storm collection 321 events in the north sea have been simulated with coupled and uncoupled methods in xl19 where the roughness length z 0 and drag coefficient c d are calculated by wblm and coare3 0 as a result the empirical parameterization methods fail to reproduce z 0 and c d in shallow waters during storms due to the failure of identifying the peak wave length or period and the parameters fitted from one dataset may significantly deviate from another on the contrary the physics based methods are free of these drawbacks as z 0 and c d are directly estimated from the wave spectrum based on the momentum conservation the jans method overestimates c d as the wind speed getting higher and the wblm method overcomes this problem by introducing the spectral sheltering effect and taking account of the kinetic energy conservation within the wave boundary layer it is shown that coupling the atmosphere model with a wave model is important in shallow waters especially for strong winds such as storms which causes on average about 2 difference in the surface wind field overall the wind and wave results from the wblm coupled simulation during storms are in good agreement with measurements from six meteorological wind masts and five wave stations in the north sea the modeled wind speeds at several heights of two coastal sites namely horns rev m2 and m8 during the 321 storms are further evaluated with measurements as a result the statistics of the wblm coupled results are slightly better than the uncoupled result but the difference between the two experiments are relatively small considering that in fig 4f the c d from wblm during the 321 storms gray color are mainly concentrated close to the coare3 0 curve for wind speed less than about 30 ms 1 it is not surprising that the statistics of wblm coupled results are close to the uncoupled one therefore we conclude that for most of the cases the uncoupled models are still reliable but for special conditions such as in shallow waters or storm conditions the wblm based coupling system is recommended for wind and wave simulations in order to ensure the momentum conservation across the wave boundary layer and thus to improve the result of

23814,wave decay in the marginal ice zones miz plays a crucial role in shaping the arctic ocean behaviours parameterizing wave decay in the miz is indispensable in climate models for better capturing the climate change in the arctic however current wave decay parameterizations were developed without considering the influences of wave source terms this study investigated the role and contributions of different source terms in shaping the miz wave decay based on sensitivity simulations simulation results show that the ice induced damping term is the main contributor to miz wave decay the wind input source term also plays an important role in the wave evolution in the miz during high wind speeds wind speed 10 m s wind input was found to increase the wave height by about 10 on average relative to the wave height decayed by ice irrespective of the sea ice concentration wind input contributes up to 30 in high wind speed areas with low sea ice concentration meanwhile the contributions from wind input term to miz wave are more important when winds blow from the open water to miz however the angle between winds and waves is insignificant in shaping contributions from wind input low sic and high wind speed conditions also favour the enhancement of wave spreading in general the contributions from nonlinear wave wave interactions and dissipation source terms were found to play a minor role in shaping miz wave decay however the role of nonlinear wave wave interactions can be important in shaping the wave spectrum thus it is suggested to update the model wave decay parameterizations to accommodate the role played by wind input source term in particular under high wind speed conditions keywords wave decay marginal ice zone source terms attenuation coefficient data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the arctic ocean is one of the global climate change hotspots over the last decades statistically significant positive trends in the surface gravity wave height have been identified in the arctic ocean liu et al 2016 a study by casas prat and wang 2020 projects that along the beaufort sea coastlines the annual chance of damaging extreme waves may increase from 1 20th to over 1 5th in the year 2100 these sensitive behaviours can be directly correlated with the decline of arctic sea ice extent cavalieri and parkinson 2012 and thickness maslanik et al 2011 this correlation highlights the pivotal role played by marginal ice zones miz in shaping arctic ocean wave behaviours miz is the portion of the sea that is influenced by various open ocean processes and simultaneously acts as a transition region between the open ocean and the continuous ice pack in the present study it is characterized by the sea ice concentration sic ranging between 20 and 80 sic corresponds to the fraction of the area covered by sea ice and it guides the surface air sea exchanges of heat momentum moisture and gases detailed studies describing the role of miz in shaping the polar ecosystem and climate system and global climatology have been conducted by researchers around the world e g manucharyan and thompson 2017 renfrew et al 2019 røed and o brien 1983 wu 2021 from an oceanographic perspective the interactions between waves and sea ice contribute to the significance of miz the existence of an ice layer suppresses the wind wave due to different material properties zhao and zhang 2021 wind waves interacting with sea ice decrease in amplitude as a result of two processes scattering and dissipation squire 2007 scattering redistributes the wave energy without eliminating it while dissipation reassigns the energy to other systems like atmosphere ice water subject to wave action sea ice can break apart into smaller floes and could be subject to faster melting and transport squire 2007 this can provide more space for wave development and can favour farther penetration of waves into the ice covered seas with the increased surface wave activities stronger sea ice breaking is favoured over time these processes repeatedly occur and get stronger this positive feedback mechanism is one of the driving forces of arctic ocean behaviours stopa et al 2016 details of exhaustive bibliography focusing on physical aspects of wave ice interaction studies can be found in squire 2007 inside the miz the amplitude of surface gravity waves is reduced and they continue to propagate beneath the ice cover these surface gravity waves can be understood as a combination of waves generated by the local wind sea waves and waves generated elsewhere swell waves momentum transfer from the winds generates sea waves sea waves are subject to higher magnitudes of attenuation by ice which limits their propagation into high sic regions meanwhile swell waves are relatively less attenuated and propagate farther into the higher sic regions squire et al 1995 hence swell waves dominate the miz wadhams 1978 observed that the decay of wave energy increased exponentially with the distance travelled in the miz this decay of wave energy is accounted as a function of the attenuation coefficient α which itself is a function of wave frequency squire and moore 1980 wadhams et al 1988 1 e x e 0 e x p α x such that e is the energy density with 0 and x representing the distance progressed however recent studies e g kohout et al 2014 montiel et al 2018 have identified that this exponential relationship may not always be valid linear decay replacing exponential decay was observed for large waves and extreme wind conditions various studies have been conducted around the world in an attempt to address this inconsistency e g thomson et al 2021 liu et al 2020 squire 2018 owing to various difficulties in conducting in situ studies miz wave decay in the present day is mostly studied with the aid of numerical models however these models usually neglect the contributions of various source terms in parameterizing miz wave decay thus in the present study instead of developing a new wave decay parameterization in the miz we take one step back to explore if the wave source terms are important in shaping miz wave decay the remaining portion of the study is organized as follows section 2 discusses briefly different wave source terms the study domain model configuration forcing datasets and the experimental design are presented in section 3 after presenting the simulation results in section 4 and discussions in section 5 the conclusions drawn are summarized in section 6 2 theory wave spectrum describes the distribution of energy among waves of different frequencies therefore the evolution of the wave spectrum represents the statistical evolution of waves themselves in numerical models the evolution of the wave spectrum is usually represented using the action balance equation eq 2 2 n t c g u n k c k n s t o t σ where action density n is related to energy density e by division through intrinsic frequency σ here and k represent the horizontal and spectral space divergence operators u is the ocean current k is the wavenumber vector and c g and c k are group velocity and spectral advection velocity respectively the left hand side of eq 2 describes the kinematics of the waves and the right hand side describes the different source and sink terms total energy flux s t o t contributing to wind wave evolution in deep open water komen et al 1996 is defined as the combination of different physical processes summarized as s i n the atmospheric input s d s wave breaking and turbulence induced dissipation and s n l the nonlinear wave wave interaction however inside the miz this is modified to account for the damping induced by the ice field s i c e eq 3 3 s t o t s i n s d s s n l s i c e where 4 s i c e e c g α 2 c g k i k i is an alternative notation for attenuation such that k i α 2 since the presence of ice can limit the energy flux from winds to waves and the associated dissipative processes masson and leblond 1989 redefined eq 3 further based on surface sea ice concentration c i eq 5 5 s t o t 1 c i s i n s d s s n l c i s i c e following this convention wind input and wave breaking terms are reduced by a factor of 1 c i the wind input term s i n accounts for the changes induced by winds on wave action density eq 6 6 s i n β k θ n k θ σ where β is the wind wave growth rate and θ is the wave direction in addition to the energy flux from winds to waves swell wave feedbacks to winds also exist present day numerical models are usually parameterized to account for this the nonlinear wave wave interactions term s n l accounts for the redistribution of wave energy over the spectrum due to an exchange of energy resulting from resonant sets of wave components nonlinear wave wave interactions are usually employed as either a four wave interactions in deep and intermediate oceans quadruplets or b three wave interactions in shallow waters triads in quadruplets the wave energy from peak frequency gets transferred to lower frequencies while in triads the wave energy from lower frequencies is redistributed to higher frequencies and transforms single peaked wave spectra into multiple peaked wave spectra as they approach the shore the wave dissipation term s d s accounts for the changes induced by energy dissipative processes like wave breaking turbulence and whitecapping the dissipation term is derived as the sum of three terms a a saturation based term that combines an isotropic part and a direction dependent part b a cumulative breaking term representing the effect of long waves on short waves and c wave turbulence interaction term ardhuin and jenkins 2006 teixeira and belcher 2002 3 numerical model and

complete description of the cruise and the data collected during the cruise can be found in thomson 2015 3 2 wavewatch iii wavewatch iii ww3 is a state of the art third generation spectral wave model which computes the wave action equation eq 2 this model has been assessed by numerous researchers in the past and has been validated for studies in the miz e g rogers et al 2016 thomson et al 2018 ww3 employs various packages to account for different source and sink terms in the present study the st4 package for wind input and dissipation source terms ardhuin et al 2010 is used in st4 the positive part of the wind input taken from wam cycle 4 st3 with an ad hoc reduction of the wind friction velocity u is employed to account for the wind input u is employed to balance a saturation based dissipation of waves the st4 module is also equipped to account for the swell feedback on wind input ardhuin et al 2009 the nonlinear wave wave interactions are accounted for using the nl1 switch quadruplets which is based on the discrete interaction approximation dia proposed by hasselmann et al 1985 according to the dia model instead of wavenumber direction spectrum n k θ the source term s n l is computed for a frequency direction spectrum f f r θ where f r is the wave frequency detailed descriptions regarding nonlinear wave wave interactions can be found in holthuijsen 2010 the ic4 method 5 collins and rogers 2017 and is2 dissipation and scattering packages are switched on to account for the effects of sea ice on waves this parameterization of the ice source term was developed and validated based on wave measurements used in this study ic4 is forced with k i equal to α 2 refer eq 4 values 5 10 6 7 10 6 15 10 6 100 10 6 to represent attenuation the k i values are provided as a step function in frequency space such that 0 10 0 12 and 0 16 are the end of frequency in hz ranges collins and rogers 2017 in addition to these parameterizations two one way nested domains were used in this study see fig 1 the outer domain covers between 175 e 225 e 135 w and 65 n 85 n with a 0 25 spatial resolution and 90 s temporal resolutions it provides the boundary condition for the inner domain which has a horizontal resolution of 0 09 and 60s time step the direction resolution is adjusted to 15 degrees the wave spectrum is discredited into 25 frequencies starting from 0 0411 hz with an increment factor of 1 1 the hourly outputs from the inner domain are used in the following analysis 3 3 input datasets and their sensitivity the surface wind and sic are two key forcing data determining the performance of the model simulations in the miz in this subsection three datasets were compared to identify the ideal forcing data for the evaluation of source terms the reanalysis datasets were era5 era interim and cera sat the spatial and temporal resolutions for each dataset are given in table 1 era5 combines vast amounts of historical observations into global estimates using advanced modelling and data assimilation systems it is produced using 4d var data assimilation and model forecasts in cy41r2 of the ecmwf integrated forecast system ifs hersbach et al 2020 while era interim the previous version of ecmwf reanalysis data assimilation system is based on a 2006 release of the ifs cy31r2 berrisford et al 2009 cera sat was produced with cera assimilation system and ifs version cy42r1 this ensemble accounts for model and observational errors and can be used to infer information on the uncertainty of the analysed fields schepers et al 2018 in total 6 sensitivity test simulations were completed such that three simulations analysed different 10 m surface wind datasets and the other three simulations analysed different sic datasets all sensitivity test simulations were completed for two weeks between 00 00 october 1 and 23 00 october 14 2015 the first 7 days were treated as spin up time and excluded in the following comparison simulations evaluating the sensitivity of surface wind were forced with the era5 sic data owing to its relatively higher resolution model outputs were then compared with the measured wave data results showed that despite underestimation of significant wave height and overestimation of mean wave period all wind sensitivity test simulations reproduce the significant wave height and mean wave period with reasonable accuracy fig 2a and b statistical analysis table 2 showed that era5 forced simulation reproduced significant wave height with least bias root mean square error rmse and best correlation coefficient era5 forced simulation was also better in reproducing the mean wave period with low rmse and better correlation however the bias estimate was relatively high era5 dataset was hence identified as the preferred surface wind dataset acknowledging the previous results sic sensitivity test simulations were forced with the era5 wind input dataset comparison between sic sensitivity simulation outputs and measured data also showed reasonable agreement for all input forcing fig 2c and d an underestimation of significant wave height was observed for most simulations statistical analysis showed that era5 forced simulation was better successful in reproducing significant wave height with a mean bias of 0 07 m rmse of 0 27 and correlation coefficient of 0 89 however cera sat forced simulation showed a better agreement with measured data for the mean wave period the statistical error measures for the mean wave period were 0 57 s bias 0 79 s rmse and 0 94 correlation coefficient for cera sat simulation an additional simulation was done with ice and wind forcing from era interim the results from the simulation are worse than that using the forcing from era5 considering the aim of the study i e exploring the contribution of wave source terms on the wave decay in the miz and the metrics of the above 6 simulations era5 10 m wind and sic data were chosen to force the model simulations for the rest of the study meanwhile tuning the parameters in the parameterization of ic4 method 5 may result in better model performances one needs to note that ice4 method 5 was developed and tuned based on the measurements used in the above model comparison thus the unsatisfactory performance of the model under high wind conditions is highly induced by some other uncovered factors in the parameterizations which will be explored in the rest of the study 3 4 characteristics of the study domain over the beaufort sea a strong wind event reaching up to 23 m s occurred between 10 14 october 2015 these conditions are expected to occur because of the high and low counter rotating pressure systems in the north and south of the beaufort sea inside the study domain inner the temporal mean wind speed 1 31 october 2015 peaked close to the coast in the south and along the higher latitudes and higher sic regions the wind speeds were relatively low fig 3a maximum and mean wind speeds over the inner domain were 17 m s and 9 m s respectively the miz during the study period was found to be aligned almost along the latitudes and parallel to the coast the southern regions of the miz had lower sic compared to northern regions with higher sic fig 3c over time miz progressed southward towards lower latitudes fig 1 the mean significant wave height is more than 1 2 m in the open water areas and decreases when approaching the miz fig 3b the mean significant wave height inside the miz is up to 0 8 m and the mean wave direction is from east and southeast fig 3d 3 5 experiments the experimental design consists of a control simulation and a set of sensitivity experiments all simulations were run for the period between 1 31 october 2015 with the parameterizations described in section 3 2 the initial 7 days of the simulation were treated as spin up time and excluded from analyses the set of sensitivity experiments included 4 parametrized simulations such that for each simulation the contribution from one of the source terms was turned off inside the miz 20 sic 80 analysing the differences between the control simulation and each of these sensitivity simulations individually can hence account for the changes induced by the presence of corresponding source terms on the miz wave decay details of the simulations are summarized in table 3 4 results in this study only the simulation results within the miz are used for the analyses unless specified otherwise since the wave ice interaction is significantly different for sea and swell waves they are analysed separately in the following subsections theoretically waves are classified into sea waves and swell waves based on their wave age c u10 where c is the wave phase speed and u 10 is the mean wind speed at 10 m above the sea surface for swell waves the wave age c u10 is greater than 1 2 meaning that they move faster than the wind at 10 m ww3 computes the significant wave height h s as the fourth root of wave energy variance 7 h s 4 e ww3 also offers partitioning of the spectrum into different spectral bins in the results presented ahead significant sea swell wave height is used instead of the wave spectrum considering that significant wave height is representative of the wave energy this choice is expected to avoid possible difficulties in presenting interpreting results in the present study the topographic partitioning method ww3dg 2019 was employed to estimate the wind sea fraction and a set of swell components having the model estimated significant total wave height h s and significant sea wave height h w w significant swell wave height h s w was theoretically calculated such that 8 h s 2 h w w 2 h s w 2 the results generated were analysed and presented in figures for better understanding these figures include statistical analyses which represented the 10 90 percentiles of output datasets in boxes these boxes have middle notches showing the mean values and outward lines representing the standard deviation of the dataset the data sample counts are also presented in the figures alongside the 10 90 percentile boxes it is also to be noted that the data at every 4th timestep and grid points are used for representations ahead 4 1 waves in the marginal ice zone analysis of the ctrl simulation is initially completed to understand the miz wave characteristics during the study period the significant wave height h s maximum for the period and domain was 3 8 m while the spatio temporal mean was 0 32 m however inside the miz the maximum h s was 3 4 m with spatio temporal mean of 0 29 m significant wind sea wave height h ww and significant swell wave height h sw marked a maximum of 3 4 m and 2 m respectively inside the miz the mean h ww and h sw inside the miz were 0 87 m and 0 16 m respectively in response to increasing sic h s h ww and h sw were found to be less dispersed fig 4a c and e the mean h s was also found to decrease with increasing sic indicating that high low waves dominate lower higher sic regions simultaneously in response to increasing wind speed mean h s h ww and h sw were found to increase fig 4b d and f however the mean h sw was not increasing when wind speed was over 12 m s a few additional analyses were also completed and found that sea waves are the main contributors to the significant wave height h s during high wave conditions while swell waves are the main contributor under low wave conditions the figure is not shown 4 2 changes induced by ice induced damping term s ice s ice term was introduced to the wave action balance equation eq 2 to account for the ice induced wave decay estimation of the difference between ctrl and icesim simulations showed that the presence of the s ice term induced a mean spatio temporal decrease of 0 65 m 70 0 49 m 45 and 0 17 m 51 in h s h ww and h sw respectively these changes induced in the presence of s ice term were found to vary with sic and wind speeds in response to the increasing sic changes in h s h ww and h sw displayed different trends fig 5a c and e magnitudes of changes in h s and h ww increased initially with the mean change peaking between 0 5 0 6 sic for h s and 0 2 0 3 sic for h ww meanwhile the changes in h sw continued to increase with increasing sic ice induced wave decay is parameterized in such a way that as the sic of the region is increasing changes in h s also increase however the magnitude of absolute changes in h ww s ice induced showed a decline in high sic regions fig 5c since lower sic regions favoured higher waves and higher waves favour higher magnitudes of changes these results agree with the parameterization that both regional sic and attenuation coefficients are important in shaping the s ice induced wave decay changes induced by s ice term were also found to vary with wind speed 10 m wind speed u 10 with increasing wind speeds h s and h ww were subject to increased ice induced damping fig 5b and d following the model parameterization higher frequency waves are subject to higher magnitudes of ice induced damping however when the wind speed was greater than 12 m s the ice induced damping was decreasing the reason for this behaviour change is investigated in section 5 meanwhile with increasing wind speed the mean changes in h sw decreased initially and when the wind speed was greater than 10 m s it increased h sw fig 5f according to the definition waves are categorized as sea swell waves depending on the wave age i e the ratio between wave phase speed and wind speed under low wind speed conditions waves of relatively higher frequencies are classified as swell waves while during higher wind speed conditions few of these waves might be recategorized as sea waves based on wave age thus during low wind speed conditions it appears that swell waves are parameterized with relatively higher attenuation coefficients this results in higher magnitudes of ice induced damping of swell waves under low wind speed conditions in contrast to this during high wind speed conditions only very low frequency waves are categorized as swell waves and they are parameterized with lower attenuation coefficients this results in lower magnitudes of ice induced damping of swell waves with increasing wind speed the reasons for the increase in h sw under high wind speed conditions are discussed in section 5 thus s ice was found to reduce miz wave energy depending on the sic and wind speed these changes induced by s ice term accounted for most of the changes induced to miz waves and are reasonably well accounted for by the existing parameterizations however the parameterization of s ice was found to have some inconsistencies in high wind speed conditions 4 3 changes induced by wind input source term s in s in term is known to be a key player in shaping open ocean wave climatology it transfers energy and momentum from winds to waves thereby playing a pivotal role in shaping wave spectrum and wave decay however inside the miz various factors can pose restrictions to the wind to wave energy fluxes estimation of the difference between ctrl and inpsim simulations showed that s in induced a mean increase spatio temporal of 0 02 m in miz h s which is about 6 9 of the mean miz h s estimated by ctrl although this magnitude of change is specific for the study domain it could be an indication of any possible significance of s in in shaping miz wave energy and hence analysed in detail ww3 is parameterized to account for the ice induced spatial restrictions eq 5 the relative changes in h s with respect to the changes induced by s ice induced by s in are significant in low sic regions statistical analysis showed that with increasing sic the mean changes induced by s in became lower and less dispersed for h s and h ww fig 6a and d in the presence of wind input h sw also gets enhanced by the energy redistributed through nonlinear wave wave interactions as the swell waves propagate into higher sic regions it is subject to increased swell wave decay fig 6g thus the relative changes in h sw are expected to decrease with increasing sic however in the present case peak wind speeds were mostly associated with regions of sic 0 4 0 5 hence the relative changes in h sw are more dispersed along these sic regions according to the model parameterization higher wind speeds mean more wind to wave energy flux hence s in induced changes in h s and h ww increased with increasing wind speeds fig 6b and e during high wind speed conditions wind speed 10 m s the relative changes in h s marked a maximum of about 50 and mean of 10 this indicates the significance of s in term in miz wave decay during high wind speed conditions it was also noted that the response of h s and h ww in high wind speed conditions was similar meanwhile for the swell waves relative changes in h sw were most dispersed when wind speeds were between 6 8 m s however no specific trends were identified for the relative changes in h sw with respect to varying wind speed the relationship with wind speed and sic was further analysed to identify that these two parameters work collectively in shaping the contributions from s in to wave energy fig 7 s in induced changes relative to s ice to h s at a specific sic increased with increasing wind speed simultaneously as the sic increase s in induced changes were decreasing for all wind speeds thus low sic and high wind speed conditions favoured the most significant contribution from s in while high sic and low wind speeds favour the least the response of significant wave heights to wind directions was also analysed fig 6c f and i since the miz edges were almost parallel to the latitudes the wind direction was classified into 2 categories a winds blowing from between 270 90 meteorological convention such that they are assumed to be blowing from continuous ice covered regions miz to the open water b winds blowing from remaining directions assumed to be blowing from the open ocean from coast side into the miz it was observed that the relative changes induced to h s and h ww were higher and more dispersed when winds blew from the open water into miz fig 6c and f when the winds are blowing from miz ice covered regions to the open water they were lower and less dispersed in the latter scenario when winds blew from miz ice covered regions to open waters sea waves were generated in relatively higher sic and travelled into lower sic regions and further into regions outside the miz being generated in relatively higher sic regions significant wave heights of these waves are relatively low additionally propagation through the miz contributed to its decay also in contrast to this when winds blew from the open water to miz sea waves generated near the miz boundaries and in relatively lower sic regions propagated into relatively higher sic regions being generated in lower sic regions or miz boundaries these waves are relatively high and propagate into the miz these contribute to the observed behaviour the response of h sw to wind direction fig 6i showed no particular significance since wind input is primarily contributing to sea waves having identified the response of s in induced changes to wind directions its response to the angle between wind and mean wave referred as wind wave angle hereafter was also analysed however no noticeable trend was found suggesting that the angle between winds and waves might not be a decisive player in shaping miz wave energy 4 4 changes induced by nonlinear wave wave interactions source term s nl nonlinear wave wave interactions are known to redistribute energy between waves of different frequencies it does not involve the exchange of energy between waves and an external system statistical analysis of changes induced by s nl term in h s fig 8a and b identified that the contributions are relatively small with mean change ranging only about 4 of that by the s ice term it is however acknowledged that the nonlinear wave wave interactions can play a role in shaping the wave spectrum s nl term was parameterized independently of the sic restrictions eq 5 however the analysis of the relative changes relative to changes induced by s ice induced by s nl on h s h ww and h sw were sensitive to varying sic despite being small these changes were more dispersed in low sic regions fig 8a c and e and with increasing sic they became less dispersed statistical analysis also showed that the relative changes induced by s nl became more dispersed with increasing wind speed fig 8b d and f the response of mean changes relative to s ice with increasing wind speed indicates that h s and h ww are decreased by the redistribution of energy to lower frequency waves while h sw is increasing owing to the same reason fig 8b d and f 4 5 changes induced by dissipation source term s ds changes in wave energy induced by dissipation source term were also analysed to completely understand the wave decay in the miz inside the miz h s h ww and h sw were found to decrease because of various dissipative processes however the magnitudes of these changes were negligibly small the mean changes induced by s ds on h s were estimated to be 1 of that by the s ice term this suggests the possible insignificance of s ds term in shaping the miz wave energy to confirm this insignificance the relative changes induced by s ds under different conditions were also analysed irrespective of the sic the mean changes induced on h s h ww and h sw were less than 2 of that by the s ice term fig 9a c and e following the model parameterization the relative changes relative to s ice in significant wave heights were also found to be less dispersed and decreasing with increasing sic fig 9a and c meanwhile s ds induced changes in h sw were negligibly small irrespective of sic fig 9e this is logical since swell waves are less dissipated during their propagation the role of s ds in miz wave decay could be sea wave guided s ds induced relative changes in h s h ww and h sw were also found to vary with wind speed conditions following the model parameterization the relative changes were increasingly dispersed with increasing wind speed fig 9b d and f similar to its response with varying sic responses of h s and h ww to varying wind speeds were similar these results reaffirm the conclusion that the role of s ds in shaping miz wave decay is sea wave guided and negligible 5 discussion wave decay in the miz is usually parameterized in numerical models based on the exponential decay theory eq 1 which was developed based on observation it explains that the ice induced damping attenuation coefficient shapes the decay of miz waves the contributions changes induced by other source terms are usually assumed to be negligible when developing the wave decay parameterizations in the miz however recent studies e g kohout et al 2014 montiel et al 2018 have identified inconsistencies with the exponential decay theory a study by thomson et al 2021 even explained that the noises in raw wave data can contribute to spurious energies in observed wave spectra hence contributions from various source terms to wave energy were analysed to bring clarity to the cause of this inconsistency results from the sensitivity simulations explicitly identified that the ice induced damping term s ice is the key player in shaping miz wave decay table 4 this observation agreed with the existing theories and model parameterizations however some inconsistencies with parameterizations were observed in high wind speed conditions where the contributions from s in can be significant being significant the changes induced by s in can be crucial in shaping the miz wave energy simulation results showed that the contributions from s in modified miz wave energy by 7 mean this gives a potential explanation of why exponential decay theory had inconsistency in high wind speed conditions kohout et al 2014 montiel et al 2018 it is now evident why the changes induced in the presence of s ice term on h s and h ww were relatively lower when wind speeds were over 12 m s fig 5b and d during those instances s in term made a considerable contribution to miz wave energy resulting in the observed trend the increase in h sw in high wind speeds fig 5f is also contributed by s in term such that the interplay between s in and s nl redistributed energy to the low frequency swell waves this can also explain the bias of model estimated h s for all evaluated datasets sic and wind in high wave conditions fig 2a and c these results validate our conclusion that wave energy decay during high wind speed conditions needs to consider the contributions from s in having understood the role of s in term by analysing bulk parameter now wave spectra and its response to s in term was also analysed for reaffirmation for the ease of presenting this 1d wave spectra at 4 different locations within the miz sic 0 25 on 12 october 2015 12 00 and 22 october 2015 13 00 fig 10 were used wave age based sea swell wave separating criteria were also included for bringing clarity it was found that for all locations and timesteps the spectral energy density of sea waves was increased by s in meanwhile the influence on swell waves was relatively small this observation agrees well with the results from analyses of the bulk parameter fig 6 in addition to the 1d wave spectra spatial characteristics of spectral energy were also analysed 2 specific timesteps representing high and moderate low wind speeds are presented for ease of understanding fig 11 12 october 2015 12 00 represented high wind speed conditions such that at this time the maximum and mean wind speeds inside the miz were 14 m s and 11 m s respectively 22 october 2015 13 00 represented moderate low wind speed conditions such that at this time the maximum and mean wind speeds were 10ms s and 8 m s respectively considering that sea waves are mostly affected 0 3047 hz frequency wave was chosen since it can be classified as a sea wave during both timesteps and over the entire miz analysis of the absolute changes in spectral energy densities indicated that significant changes were associated with regions of low sic meanwhile the significant relative changes were associated with higher sic regions the results are in agreement with the conclusions drawn from the analysis using the bulk parameter having understood the behaviour it is to be acknowledged that in the real world absolute actual changes in wave energy could be more important than the relative changes it was also observed that for sea waves neither the miz width along longitudes nor the miz width along the wave directions showed any observable trend significance in shaping the wave spectra however in favourable conditions if the gradient of sic is small it can favour more s in induced changes inside miz thus considering the relative insignificance of s in induced changes to swell waves the role of miz width in shaping the wave spectra could be neglected in the areas with lower sic the wind input energy to waves was relatively larger fig 6 thus the wave spreading was enhanced inside the miz with lower sic when adding the wind input terms one can see that the magnitude of these changes was higher in lower sic regions and decreased with increasing sic fig 12 considering that the wave spreading is higher in high wind speed conditions it is now evident that the conditions favouring significant wind input low sic and high wind speeds can cause significant changes to wave spreading and thereby result in modification of wave spectra thus the impact of wind input on the wave spreading can potentially affect the quantifying of wave decay scatter by ice in the miz which needs to be further explored 6 conclusions inconsistency in the existing wave decay parameterizations was pointed out by recent studies this study analysed the contributions from various source terms in shaping the miz wave decay the scope of the study included identifying any inaccuracies associated with the present miz wave decay parameterizations a set of 4 sensitivity simulations were completed and compared with a control simulation to account for the contributions of different source terms the key conclusions were s ice term is the main contributor to miz wave decay this significance of s ice term is prominent when wind speeds are low and sic is high the present parametrization is reasonably successful in accounting for the contributions from s ice to miz wave decay these parameterizations however have limitations in high winds speed conditions in low sic and high wind speed conditions wind speed 10 m s s in induced considerable changes 10 of that s ice to miz wave energy and its decay such significant contributions should be taken into account while parameterizing miz wave decay the significance of changes induced by s in in shaping miz wave energy is relatively more when winds blow from the open waters into the miz than when winds blow from continuous ice miz to the open waters however the angle between winds and waves showed no role in shaping the contributions from s in s in induced changes are significant only to sea waves the changes associated with swell waves are small negligible s in induced changes to sea waves are not restricted by the width of miz in low sic and high wind speed conditions s in can contribute to a significant modification in wave spreading which results in changes to wave spectra s nl and s ds terms make negligible contributions to miz wave energy irrespective of the sic wind speed or wind wave angle and can hence be neglected while parameterizing miz wave decay the results suggest that the presently used miz wave decay parameterization exponential decay needs to be updated with the inclusion of s in term and considering the role of sic wind speed and direction credit authorship contribution statement george victor emmanuel conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology

23814,wave decay in the marginal ice zones miz plays a crucial role in shaping the arctic ocean behaviours parameterizing wave decay in the miz is indispensable in climate models for better capturing the climate change in the arctic however current wave decay parameterizations were developed without considering the influences of wave source terms this study investigated the role and contributions of different source terms in shaping the miz wave decay based on sensitivity simulations simulation results show that the ice induced damping term is the main contributor to miz wave decay the wind input source term also plays an important role in the wave evolution in the miz during high wind speeds wind speed 10 m s wind input was found to increase the wave height by about 10 on average relative to the wave height decayed by ice irrespective of the sea ice concentration wind input contributes up to 30 in high wind speed areas with low sea ice concentration meanwhile the contributions from wind input term to miz wave are more important when winds blow from the open water to miz however the angle between winds and waves is insignificant in shaping contributions from wind input low sic and high wind speed conditions also favour the enhancement of wave spreading in general the contributions from nonlinear wave wave interactions and dissipation source terms were found to play a minor role in shaping miz wave decay however the role of nonlinear wave wave interactions can be important in shaping the wave spectrum thus it is suggested to update the model wave decay parameterizations to accommodate the role played by wind input source term in particular under high wind speed conditions keywords wave decay marginal ice zone source terms attenuation coefficient data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the arctic ocean is one of the global climate change hotspots over the last decades statistically significant positive trends in the surface gravity wave height have been identified in the arctic ocean liu et al 2016 a study by casas prat and wang 2020 projects that along the beaufort sea coastlines the annual chance of damaging extreme waves may increase from 1 20th to over 1 5th in the year 2100 these sensitive behaviours can be directly correlated with the decline of arctic sea ice extent cavalieri and parkinson 2012 and thickness maslanik et al 2011 this correlation highlights the pivotal role played by marginal ice zones miz in shaping arctic ocean wave behaviours miz is the portion of the sea that is influenced by various open ocean processes and simultaneously acts as a transition region between the open ocean and the continuous ice pack in the present study it is characterized by the sea ice concentration sic ranging between 20 and 80 sic corresponds to the fraction of the area covered by sea ice and it guides the surface air sea exchanges of heat momentum moisture and gases detailed studies describing the role of miz in shaping the polar ecosystem and climate system and global climatology have been conducted by researchers around the world e g manucharyan and thompson 2017 renfrew et al 2019 røed and o brien 1983 wu 2021 from an oceanographic perspective the interactions between waves and sea ice contribute to the significance of miz the existence of an ice layer suppresses the wind wave due to different material properties zhao and zhang 2021 wind waves interacting with sea ice decrease in amplitude as a result of two processes scattering and dissipation squire 2007 scattering redistributes the wave energy without eliminating it while dissipation reassigns the energy to other systems like atmosphere ice water subject to wave action sea ice can break apart into smaller floes and could be subject to faster melting and transport squire 2007 this can provide more space for wave development and can favour farther penetration of waves into the ice covered seas with the increased surface wave activities stronger sea ice breaking is favoured over time these processes repeatedly occur and get stronger this positive feedback mechanism is one of the driving forces of arctic ocean behaviours stopa et al 2016 details of exhaustive bibliography focusing on physical aspects of wave ice interaction studies can be found in squire 2007 inside the miz the amplitude of surface gravity waves is reduced and they continue to propagate beneath the ice cover these surface gravity waves can be understood as a combination of waves generated by the local wind sea waves and waves generated elsewhere swell waves momentum transfer from the winds generates sea waves sea waves are subject to higher magnitudes of attenuation by ice which limits their propagation into high sic regions meanwhile swell waves are relatively less attenuated and propagate farther into the higher sic regions squire et al 1995 hence swell waves dominate the miz wadhams 1978 observed that the decay of wave energy increased exponentially with the distance travelled in the miz this decay of wave energy is accounted as a function of the attenuation coefficient α which itself is a function of wave frequency squire and moore 1980 wadhams et al 1988 1 e x e 0 e x p α x such that e is the energy density with 0 and x representing the distance progressed however recent studies e g kohout et al 2014 montiel et al 2018 have identified that this exponential relationship may not always be valid linear decay replacing exponential decay was observed for large waves and extreme wind conditions various studies have been conducted around the world in an attempt to address this inconsistency e g thomson et al 2021 liu et al 2020 squire 2018 owing to various difficulties in conducting in situ studies miz wave decay in the present day is mostly studied with the aid of numerical models however these models usually neglect the contributions of various source terms in parameterizing miz wave decay thus in the present study instead of developing a new wave decay parameterization in the miz we take one step back to explore if the wave source terms are important in shaping miz wave decay the remaining portion of the study is organized as follows section 2 discusses briefly different wave source terms the study domain model configuration forcing datasets and the experimental design are presented in section 3 after presenting the simulation results in section 4 and discussions in section 5 the conclusions drawn are summarized in section 6 2 theory wave spectrum describes the distribution of energy among waves of different frequencies therefore the evolution of the wave spectrum represents the statistical evolution of waves themselves in numerical models the evolution of the wave spectrum is usually represented using the action balance equation eq 2 2 n t c g u n k c k n s t o t σ where action density n is related to energy density e by division through intrinsic frequency σ here and k represent the horizontal and spectral space divergence operators u is the ocean current k is the wavenumber vector and c g and c k are group velocity and spectral advection velocity respectively the left hand side of eq 2 describes the kinematics of the waves and the right hand side describes the different source and sink terms total energy flux s t o t contributing to wind wave evolution in deep open water komen et al 1996 is defined as the combination of different physical processes summarized as s i n the atmospheric input s d s wave breaking and turbulence induced dissipation and s n l the nonlinear wave wave interaction however inside the miz this is modified to account for the damping induced by the ice field s i c e eq 3 3 s t o t s i n s d s s n l s i c e where 4 s i c e e c g α 2 c g k i k i is an alternative notation for attenuation such that k i α 2 since the presence of ice can limit the energy flux from winds to waves and the associated dissipative processes masson and leblond 1989 redefined eq 3 further based on surface sea ice concentration c i eq 5 5 s t o t 1 c i s i n s d s s n l c i s i c e following this convention wind input and wave breaking terms are reduced by a factor of 1 c i the wind input term s i n accounts for the changes induced by winds on wave action density eq 6 6 s i n β k θ n k θ σ where β is the wind wave growth rate and θ is the wave direction in addition to the energy flux from winds to waves swell wave feedbacks to winds also exist present day numerical models are usually parameterized to account for this the nonlinear wave wave interactions term s n l accounts for the redistribution of wave energy over the spectrum due to an exchange of energy resulting from resonant sets of wave components nonlinear wave wave interactions are usually employed as either a four wave interactions in deep and intermediate oceans quadruplets or b three wave interactions in shallow waters triads in quadruplets the wave energy from peak frequency gets transferred to lower frequencies while in triads the wave energy from lower frequencies is redistributed to higher frequencies and transforms single peaked wave spectra into multiple peaked wave spectra as they approach the shore the wave dissipation term s d s accounts for the changes induced by energy dissipative processes like wave breaking turbulence and whitecapping the dissipation term is derived as the sum of three terms a a saturation based term that combines an isotropic part and a direction dependent part b a cumulative breaking term representing the effect of long waves on short waves and c wave turbulence interaction term ardhuin and jenkins 2006 teixeira and belcher 2002 3 numerical model and

complete description of the cruise and the data collected during the cruise can be found in thomson 2015 3 2 wavewatch iii wavewatch iii ww3 is a state of the art third generation spectral wave model which computes the wave action equation eq 2 this model has been assessed by numerous researchers in the past and has been validated for studies in the miz e g rogers et al 2016 thomson et al 2018 ww3 employs various packages to account for different source and sink terms in the present study the st4 package for wind input and dissipation source terms ardhuin et al 2010 is used in st4 the positive part of the wind input taken from wam cycle 4 st3 with an ad hoc reduction of the wind friction velocity u is employed to account for the wind input u is employed to balance a saturation based dissipation of waves the st4 module is also equipped to account for the swell feedback on wind input ardhuin et al 2009 the nonlinear wave wave interactions are accounted for using the nl1 switch quadruplets which is based on the discrete interaction approximation dia proposed by hasselmann et al 1985 according to the dia model instead of wavenumber direction spectrum n k θ the source term s n l is computed for a frequency direction spectrum f f r θ where f r is the wave frequency detailed descriptions regarding nonlinear wave wave interactions can be found in holthuijsen 2010 the ic4 method 5 collins and rogers 2017 and is2 dissipation and scattering packages are switched on to account for the effects of sea ice on waves this parameterization of the ice source term was developed and validated based on wave measurements used in this study ic4 is forced with k i equal to α 2 refer eq 4 values 5 10 6 7 10 6 15 10 6 100 10 6 to represent attenuation the k i values are provided as a step function in frequency space such that 0 10 0 12 and 0 16 are the end of frequency in hz ranges collins and rogers 2017 in addition to these parameterizations two one way nested domains were used in this study see fig 1 the outer domain covers between 175 e 225 e 135 w and 65 n 85 n with a 0 25 spatial resolution and 90 s temporal resolutions it provides the boundary condition for the inner domain which has a horizontal resolution of 0 09 and 60s time step the direction resolution is adjusted to 15 degrees the wave spectrum is discredited into 25 frequencies starting from 0 0411 hz with an increment factor of 1 1 the hourly outputs from the inner domain are used in the following analysis 3 3 input datasets and their sensitivity the surface wind and sic are two key forcing data determining the performance of the model simulations in the miz in this subsection three datasets were compared to identify the ideal forcing data for the evaluation of source terms the reanalysis datasets were era5 era interim and cera sat the spatial and temporal resolutions for each dataset are given in table 1 era5 combines vast amounts of historical observations into global estimates using advanced modelling and data assimilation systems it is produced using 4d var data assimilation and model forecasts in cy41r2 of the ecmwf integrated forecast system ifs hersbach et al 2020 while era interim the previous version of ecmwf reanalysis data assimilation system is based on a 2006 release of the ifs cy31r2 berrisford et al 2009 cera sat was produced with cera assimilation system and ifs version cy42r1 this ensemble accounts for model and observational errors and can be used to infer information on the uncertainty of the analysed fields schepers et al 2018 in total 6 sensitivity test simulations were completed such that three simulations analysed different 10 m surface wind datasets and the other three simulations analysed different sic datasets all sensitivity test simulations were completed for two weeks between 00 00 october 1 and 23 00 october 14 2015 the first 7 days were treated as spin up time and excluded in the following comparison simulations evaluating the sensitivity of surface wind were forced with the era5 sic data owing to its relatively higher resolution model outputs were then compared with the measured wave data results showed that despite underestimation of significant wave height and overestimation of mean wave period all wind sensitivity test simulations reproduce the significant wave height and mean wave period with reasonable accuracy fig 2a and b statistical analysis table 2 showed that era5 forced simulation reproduced significant wave height with least bias root mean square error rmse and best correlation coefficient era5 forced simulation was also better in reproducing the mean wave period with low rmse and better correlation however the bias estimate was relatively high era5 dataset was hence identified as the preferred surface wind dataset acknowledging the previous results sic sensitivity test simulations were forced with the era5 wind input dataset comparison between sic sensitivity simulation outputs and measured data also showed reasonable agreement for all input forcing fig 2c and d an underestimation of significant wave height was observed for most simulations statistical analysis showed that era5 forced simulation was better successful in reproducing significant wave height with a mean bias of 0 07 m rmse of 0 27 and correlation coefficient of 0 89 however cera sat forced simulation showed a better agreement with measured data for the mean wave period the statistical error measures for the mean wave period were 0 57 s bias 0 79 s rmse and 0 94 correlation coefficient for cera sat simulation an additional simulation was done with ice and wind forcing from era interim the results from the simulation are worse than that using the forcing from era5 considering the aim of the study i e exploring the contribution of wave source terms on the wave decay in the miz and the metrics of the above 6 simulations era5 10 m wind and sic data were chosen to force the model simulations for the rest of the study meanwhile tuning the parameters in the parameterization of ic4 method 5 may result in better model performances one needs to note that ice4 method 5 was developed and tuned based on the measurements used in the above model comparison thus the unsatisfactory performance of the model under high wind conditions is highly induced by some other uncovered factors in the parameterizations which will be explored in the rest of the study 3 4 characteristics of the study domain over the beaufort sea a strong wind event reaching up to 23 m s occurred between 10 14 october 2015 these conditions are expected to occur because of the high and low counter rotating pressure systems in the north and south of the beaufort sea inside the study domain inner the temporal mean wind speed 1 31 october 2015 peaked close to the coast in the south and along the higher latitudes and higher sic regions the wind speeds were relatively low fig 3a maximum and mean wind speeds over the inner domain were 17 m s and 9 m s respectively the miz during the study period was found to be aligned almost along the latitudes and parallel to the coast the southern regions of the miz had lower sic compared to northern regions with higher sic fig 3c over time miz progressed southward towards lower latitudes fig 1 the mean significant wave height is more than 1 2 m in the open water areas and decreases when approaching the miz fig 3b the mean significant wave height inside the miz is up to 0 8 m and the mean wave direction is from east and southeast fig 3d 3 5 experiments the experimental design consists of a control simulation and a set of sensitivity experiments all simulations were run for the period between 1 31 october 2015 with the parameterizations described in section 3 2 the initial 7 days of the simulation were treated as spin up time and excluded from analyses the set of sensitivity experiments included 4 parametrized simulations such that for each simulation the contribution from one of the source terms was turned off inside the miz 20 sic 80 analysing the differences between the control simulation and each of these sensitivity simulations individually can hence account for the changes induced by the presence of corresponding source terms on the miz wave decay details of the simulations are summarized in table 3 4 results in this study only the simulation results within the miz are used for the analyses unless specified otherwise since the wave ice interaction is significantly different for sea and swell waves they are analysed separately in the following subsections theoretically waves are classified into sea waves and swell waves based on their wave age c u10 where c is the wave phase speed and u 10 is the mean wind speed at 10 m above the sea surface for swell waves the wave age c u10 is greater than 1 2 meaning that they move faster than the wind at 10 m ww3 computes the significant wave height h s as the fourth root of wave energy variance 7 h s 4 e ww3 also offers partitioning of the spectrum into different spectral bins in the results presented ahead significant sea swell wave height is used instead of the wave spectrum considering that significant wave height is representative of the wave energy this choice is expected to avoid possible difficulties in presenting interpreting results in the present study the topographic partitioning method ww3dg 2019 was employed to estimate the wind sea fraction and a set of swell components having the model estimated significant total wave height h s and significant sea wave height h w w significant swell wave height h s w was theoretically calculated such that 8 h s 2 h w w 2 h s w 2 the results generated were analysed and presented in figures for better understanding these figures include statistical analyses which represented the 10 90 percentiles of output datasets in boxes these boxes have middle notches showing the mean values and outward lines representing the standard deviation of the dataset the data sample counts are also presented in the figures alongside the 10 90 percentile boxes it is also to be noted that the data at every 4th timestep and grid points are used for representations ahead 4 1 waves in the marginal ice zone analysis of the ctrl simulation is initially completed to understand the miz wave characteristics during the study period the significant wave height h s maximum for the period and domain was 3 8 m while the spatio temporal mean was 0 32 m however inside the miz the maximum h s was 3 4 m with spatio temporal mean of 0 29 m significant wind sea wave height h ww and significant swell wave height h sw marked a maximum of 3 4 m and 2 m respectively inside the miz the mean h ww and h sw inside the miz were 0 87 m and 0 16 m respectively in response to increasing sic h s h ww and h sw were found to be less dispersed fig 4a c and e the mean h s was also found to decrease with increasing sic indicating that high low waves dominate lower higher sic regions simultaneously in response to increasing wind speed mean h s h ww and h sw were found to increase fig 4b d and f however the mean h sw was not increasing when wind speed was over 12 m s a few additional analyses were also completed and found that sea waves are the main contributors to the significant wave height h s during high wave conditions while swell waves are the main contributor under low wave conditions the figure is not shown 4 2 changes induced by ice induced damping term s ice s ice term was introduced to the wave action balance equation eq 2 to account for the ice induced wave decay estimation of the difference between ctrl and icesim simulations showed that the presence of the s ice term induced a mean spatio temporal decrease of 0 65 m 70 0 49 m 45 and 0 17 m 51 in h s h ww and h sw respectively these changes induced in the presence of s ice term were found to vary with sic and wind speeds in response to the increasing sic changes in h s h ww and h sw displayed different trends fig 5a c and e magnitudes of changes in h s and h ww increased initially with the mean change peaking between 0 5 0 6 sic for h s and 0 2 0 3 sic for h ww meanwhile the changes in h sw continued to increase with increasing sic ice induced wave decay is parameterized in such a way that as the sic of the region is increasing changes in h s also increase however the magnitude of absolute changes in h ww s ice induced showed a decline in high sic regions fig 5c since lower sic regions favoured higher waves and higher waves favour higher magnitudes of changes these results agree with the parameterization that both regional sic and attenuation coefficients are important in shaping the s ice induced wave decay changes induced by s ice term were also found to vary with wind speed 10 m wind speed u 10 with increasing wind speeds h s and h ww were subject to increased ice induced damping fig 5b and d following the model parameterization higher frequency waves are subject to higher magnitudes of ice induced damping however when the wind speed was greater than 12 m s the ice induced damping was decreasing the reason for this behaviour change is investigated in section 5 meanwhile with increasing wind speed the mean changes in h sw decreased initially and when the wind speed was greater than 10 m s it increased h sw fig 5f according to the definition waves are categorized as sea swell waves depending on the wave age i e the ratio between wave phase speed and wind speed under low wind speed conditions waves of relatively higher frequencies are classified as swell waves while during higher wind speed conditions few of these waves might be recategorized as sea waves based on wave age thus during low wind speed conditions it appears that swell waves are parameterized with relatively higher attenuation coefficients this results in higher magnitudes of ice induced damping of swell waves under low wind speed conditions in contrast to this during high wind speed conditions only very low frequency waves are categorized as swell waves and they are parameterized with lower attenuation coefficients this results in lower magnitudes of ice induced damping of swell waves with increasing wind speed the reasons for the increase in h sw under high wind speed conditions are discussed in section 5 thus s ice was found to reduce miz wave energy depending on the sic and wind speed these changes induced by s ice term accounted for most of the changes induced to miz waves and are reasonably well accounted for by the existing parameterizations however the parameterization of s ice was found to have some inconsistencies in high wind speed conditions 4 3 changes induced by wind input source term s in s in term is known to be a key player in shaping open ocean wave climatology it transfers energy and momentum from winds to waves thereby playing a pivotal role in shaping wave spectrum and wave decay however inside the miz various factors can pose restrictions to the wind to wave energy fluxes estimation of the difference between ctrl and inpsim simulations showed that s in induced a mean increase spatio temporal of 0 02 m in miz h s which is about 6 9 of the mean miz h s estimated by ctrl although this magnitude of change is specific for the study domain it could be an indication of any possible significance of s in in shaping miz wave energy and hence analysed in detail ww3 is parameterized to account for the ice induced spatial restrictions eq 5 the relative changes in h s with respect to the changes induced by s ice induced by s in are significant in low sic regions statistical analysis showed that with increasing sic the mean changes induced by s in became lower and less dispersed for h s and h ww fig 6a and d in the presence of wind input h sw also gets enhanced by the energy redistributed through nonlinear wave wave interactions as the swell waves propagate into higher sic regions it is subject to increased swell wave decay fig 6g thus the relative changes in h sw are expected to decrease with increasing sic however in the present case peak wind speeds were mostly associated with regions of sic 0 4 0 5 hence the relative changes in h sw are more dispersed along these sic regions according to the model parameterization higher wind speeds mean more wind to wave energy flux hence s in induced changes in h s and h ww increased with increasing wind speeds fig 6b and e during high wind speed conditions wind speed 10 m s the relative changes in h s marked a maximum of about 50 and mean of 10 this indicates the significance of s in term in miz wave decay during high wind speed conditions it was also noted that the response of h s and h ww in high wind speed conditions was similar meanwhile for the swell waves relative changes in h sw were most dispersed when wind speeds were between 6 8 m s however no specific trends were identified for the relative changes in h sw with respect to varying wind speed the relationship with wind speed and sic was further analysed to identify that these two parameters work collectively in shaping the contributions from s in to wave energy fig 7 s in induced changes relative to s ice to h s at a specific sic increased with increasing wind speed simultaneously as the sic increase s in induced changes were decreasing for all wind speeds thus low sic and high wind speed conditions favoured the most significant contribution from s in while high sic and low wind speeds favour the least the response of significant wave heights to wind directions was also analysed fig 6c f and i since the miz edges were almost parallel to the latitudes the wind direction was classified into 2 categories a winds blowing from between 270 90 meteorological convention such that they are assumed to be blowing from continuous ice covered regions miz to the open water b winds blowing from remaining directions assumed to be blowing from the open ocean from coast side into the miz it was observed that the relative changes induced to h s and h ww were higher and more dispersed when winds blew from the open water into miz fig 6c and f when the winds are blowing from miz ice covered regions to the open water they were lower and less dispersed in the latter scenario when winds blew from miz ice covered regions to open waters sea waves were generated in relatively higher sic and travelled into lower sic regions and further into regions outside the miz being generated in relatively higher sic regions significant wave heights of these waves are relatively low additionally propagation through the miz contributed to its decay also in contrast to this when winds blew from the open water to miz sea waves generated near the miz boundaries and in relatively lower sic regions propagated into relatively higher sic regions being generated in lower sic regions or miz boundaries these waves are relatively high and propagate into the miz these contribute to the observed behaviour the response of h sw to wind direction fig 6i showed no particular significance since wind input is primarily contributing to sea waves having identified the response of s in induced changes to wind directions its response to the angle between wind and mean wave referred as wind wave angle hereafter was also analysed however no noticeable trend was found suggesting that the angle between winds and waves might not be a decisive player in shaping miz wave energy 4 4 changes induced by nonlinear wave wave interactions source term s nl nonlinear wave wave interactions are known to redistribute energy between waves of different frequencies it does not involve the exchange of energy between waves and an external system statistical analysis of changes induced by s nl term in h s fig 8a and b identified that the contributions are relatively small with mean change ranging only about 4 of that by the s ice term it is however acknowledged that the nonlinear wave wave interactions can play a role in shaping the wave spectrum s nl term was parameterized independently of the sic restrictions eq 5 however the analysis of the relative changes relative to changes induced by s ice induced by s nl on h s h ww and h sw were sensitive to varying sic despite being small these changes were more dispersed in low sic regions fig 8a c and e and with increasing sic they became less dispersed statistical analysis also showed that the relative changes induced by s nl became more dispersed with increasing wind speed fig 8b d and f the response of mean changes relative to s ice with increasing wind speed indicates that h s and h ww are decreased by the redistribution of energy to lower frequency waves while h sw is increasing owing to the same reason fig 8b d and f 4 5 changes induced by dissipation source term s ds changes in wave energy induced by dissipation source term were also analysed to completely understand the wave decay in the miz inside the miz h s h ww and h sw were found to decrease because of various dissipative processes however the magnitudes of these changes were negligibly small the mean changes induced by s ds on h s were estimated to be 1 of that by the s ice term this suggests the possible insignificance of s ds term in shaping the miz wave energy to confirm this insignificance the relative changes induced by s ds under different conditions were also analysed irrespective of the sic the mean changes induced on h s h ww and h sw were less than 2 of that by the s ice term fig 9a c and e following the model parameterization the relative changes relative to s ice in significant wave heights were also found to be less dispersed and decreasing with increasing sic fig 9a and c meanwhile s ds induced changes in h sw were negligibly small irrespective of sic fig 9e this is logical since swell waves are less dissipated during their propagation the role of s ds in miz wave decay could be sea wave guided s ds induced relative changes in h s h ww and h sw were also found to vary with wind speed conditions following the model parameterization the relative changes were increasingly dispersed with increasing wind speed fig 9b d and f similar to its response with varying sic responses of h s and h ww to varying wind speeds were similar these results reaffirm the conclusion that the role of s ds in shaping miz wave decay is sea wave guided and negligible 5 discussion wave decay in the miz is usually parameterized in numerical models based on the exponential decay theory eq 1 which was developed based on observation it explains that the ice induced damping attenuation coefficient shapes the decay of miz waves the contributions changes induced by other source terms are usually assumed to be negligible when developing the wave decay parameterizations in the miz however recent studies e g kohout et al 2014 montiel et al 2018 have identified inconsistencies with the exponential decay theory a study by thomson et al 2021 even explained that the noises in raw wave data can contribute to spurious energies in observed wave spectra hence contributions from various source terms to wave energy were analysed to bring clarity to the cause of this inconsistency results from the sensitivity simulations explicitly identified that the ice induced damping term s ice is the key player in shaping miz wave decay table 4 this observation agreed with the existing theories and model parameterizations however some inconsistencies with parameterizations were observed in high wind speed conditions where the contributions from s in can be significant being significant the changes induced by s in can be crucial in shaping the miz wave energy simulation results showed that the contributions from s in modified miz wave energy by 7 mean this gives a potential explanation of why exponential decay theory had inconsistency in high wind speed conditions kohout et al 2014 montiel et al 2018 it is now evident why the changes induced in the presence of s ice term on h s and h ww were relatively lower when wind speeds were over 12 m s fig 5b and d during those instances s in term made a considerable contribution to miz wave energy resulting in the observed trend the increase in h sw in high wind speeds fig 5f is also contributed by s in term such that the interplay between s in and s nl redistributed energy to the low frequency swell waves this can also explain the bias of model estimated h s for all evaluated datasets sic and wind in high wave conditions fig 2a and c these results validate our conclusion that wave energy decay during high wind speed conditions needs to consider the contributions from s in having understood the role of s in term by analysing bulk parameter now wave spectra and its response to s in term was also analysed for reaffirmation for the ease of presenting this 1d wave spectra at 4 different locations within the miz sic 0 25 on 12 october 2015 12 00 and 22 october 2015 13 00 fig 10 were used wave age based sea swell wave separating criteria were also included for bringing clarity it was found that for all locations and timesteps the spectral energy density of sea waves was increased by s in meanwhile the influence on swell waves was relatively small this observation agrees well with the results from analyses of the bulk parameter fig 6 in addition to the 1d wave spectra spatial characteristics of spectral energy were also analysed 2 specific timesteps representing high and moderate low wind speeds are presented for ease of understanding fig 11 12 october 2015 12 00 represented high wind speed conditions such that at this time the maximum and mean wind speeds inside the miz were 14 m s and 11 m s respectively 22 october 2015 13 00 represented moderate low wind speed conditions such that at this time the maximum and mean wind speeds were 10ms s and 8 m s respectively considering that sea waves are mostly affected 0 3047 hz frequency wave was chosen since it can be classified as a sea wave during both timesteps and over the entire miz analysis of the absolute changes in spectral energy densities indicated that significant changes were associated with regions of low sic meanwhile the significant relative changes were associated with higher sic regions the results are in agreement with the conclusions drawn from the analysis using the bulk parameter having understood the behaviour it is to be acknowledged that in the real world absolute actual changes in wave energy could be more important than the relative changes it was also observed that for sea waves neither the miz width along longitudes nor the miz width along the wave directions showed any observable trend significance in shaping the wave spectra however in favourable conditions if the gradient of sic is small it can favour more s in induced changes inside miz thus considering the relative insignificance of s in induced changes to swell waves the role of miz width in shaping the wave spectra could be neglected in the areas with lower sic the wind input energy to waves was relatively larger fig 6 thus the wave spreading was enhanced inside the miz with lower sic when adding the wind input terms one can see that the magnitude of these changes was higher in lower sic regions and decreased with increasing sic fig 12 considering that the wave spreading is higher in high wind speed conditions it is now evident that the conditions favouring significant wind input low sic and high wind speeds can cause significant changes to wave spreading and thereby result in modification of wave spectra thus the impact of wind input on the wave spreading can potentially affect the quantifying of wave decay scatter by ice in the miz which needs to be further explored 6 conclusions inconsistency in the existing wave decay parameterizations was pointed out by recent studies this study analysed the contributions from various source terms in shaping the miz wave decay the scope of the study included identifying any inaccuracies associated with the present miz wave decay parameterizations a set of 4 sensitivity simulations were completed and compared with a control simulation to account for the contributions of different source terms the key conclusions were s ice term is the main contributor to miz wave decay this significance of s ice term is prominent when wind speeds are low and sic is high the present parametrization is reasonably successful in accounting for the contributions from s ice to miz wave decay these parameterizations however have limitations in high winds speed conditions in low sic and high wind speed conditions wind speed 10 m s s in induced considerable changes 10 of that s ice to miz wave energy and its decay such significant contributions should be taken into account while parameterizing miz wave decay the significance of changes induced by s in in shaping miz wave energy is relatively more when winds blow from the open waters into the miz than when winds blow from continuous ice miz to the open waters however the angle between winds and waves showed no role in shaping the contributions from s in s in induced changes are significant only to sea waves the changes associated with swell waves are small negligible s in induced changes to sea waves are not restricted by the width of miz in low sic and high wind speed conditions s in can contribute to a significant modification in wave spreading which results in changes to wave spectra s nl and s ds terms make negligible contributions to miz wave energy irrespective of the sic wind speed or wind wave angle and can hence be neglected while parameterizing miz wave decay the results suggest that the presently used miz wave decay parameterization exponential decay needs to be updated with the inclusion of s in term and considering the role of sic wind speed and direction credit authorship contribution statement george victor emmanuel conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology
