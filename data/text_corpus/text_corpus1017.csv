5085,in this article a new model is presented for imparting unsteady flow to a partially penetrating pumping well with wellbore storage placed in double permeability confined aquifers to investigate the wellbore drawdown transient behavior in this model both the fracture and matrix systems are connected directly with the wellbore as flow pathways while comprehensively considering the crossflow between the matrix and the fractures the top and bottom boundaries are assumed to be impermeable and the outer side boundaries could be infinite subsequently laplace transformation and finite fourier cosine transformation are employed to obtain analytical solutions of the dual permeability flow model in the laplace domain the derived analytical solution is general and can be reduced to several other previous results the numerical inversion algorithm of stehfest is used to solve the wellbore drawdown in the real time domain subsequently the model is validated by comparing it with previous results groundwater flow characteristics are analyzed in detail and divided into five flow stages wellbore storage flow early radial flow quasi spherical flow crossflow between the matrix and the fractures and quasi radial flow the different flow stages show some special values on the drawdown and its derivative log log plots there is a hump dip feature in the semi logarithmic curve of the drawdown derivative which are inherent characteristic for dual permeability flow behavior the effects of some important parameters of the aquifer or pumping wells on drawdown and its derivative such as wellbore storage coefficient penetration ratio crossflow coefficient storativity ratio transmissivity ratio dimensionless aquifer thickness of anisotropy and skin factor are analyzed and discussed in detail keywords three dimensional dual permeability flow partially penetrating pumping well confined aquifers analytical solution wellbore drawdown 1 introduction in the past few decades scholars have conducted several valuable studies on the unsteady drawdown behavior of fully penetrating vertical wells in confined aquifers or unconfined aquifers neuman 1972 1974 zhan et al 2001 yeh et al 2003 zhan and bian 2006 wen et al 2006 fen and yeh 2012 kuhlman 2013 feng and zhan 2015 wang and xue 2018 during the process of a groundwater pumping test the pumping well is often partially penetrated and a three dimensional groundwater flow occurs a theoretical model for unsteady flow to a partially penetrating well was first presented by hantush 1957 who used volumetric source method to solve the flow problem of a partially penetrating well in an infinite confined aquifer moench 1997 1998 used laplace transformation to derive an analytical solution for flow to a partially penetrating pumping well with storage in a uniform and anisotropic unconfined aquifer yang and yeh 2005 proposed analytical solutions for partially penetrating well in radial composite aquifers at the constant head outer boundary condition malama et al 2008 obtained a semi analytical solution of a partial penetration well in an unconfined aquifer by using a laplace hankel transform method mishra et al 2012 proposed laplace transformation based solution of a partial penetration well and considered the effect of wellbore storage and aquifer anisotropy in their model which can be also reduced to other presented analytical results theis 1935 papadopulos and cooper 1967 yang et al 2006 based on the assumptions of the continuity condition of the aquitard aquifer interface and aquifer anisotropy feng and zhan 2015 presented a new solution for a partial penetration pumping well in a leaky confined aquifer in addition when the two factors of wellbore storage and anisotropy are considered in the model the drawdown instability behavior is very different previous scholars performed a substantial amount of research on wellbore storage and anisotropy combining them into different well models papadopulos and cooper 1967 novakowski 1989 ruud and kabala 1997 cassiani and kabala 1998 zhan et al 2001 yang and yeh 2005 mathias and butler 2007 mishra et al 2012 papadopulos and cooper 1967 presented analytical solutions for a large diameter well with the wellbore storage effect and proposed the inner boundary condition of wellbore storage novakowski 1989 proposed an analytical solution of the wellbore storage effect in two zone confined aquifers and the zone near the wellbore was considered as a finite thickness skin zone in their model ruud and kabala 1997 presented an uniform well face flux model to compute drawdown for a partially penetrated well with wellbore storage cassiani and kabala 1998 presented an analytical solution for a mixed type boundary value problem by dual integral equations and the uniform well face flux assumption was also used to calculate drawdown in their model zhan et al 2001 presented an unsteady flow model for a horizontal well in an anisotropic confined aquifer and analytical solutions were obtained in the laplace domain yang and yeh 2005 presented a two zone composite model for a partially penetrating well at a constant head condition and the anisotropy was considered into their model mathias and butler 2007 presented a laplace based solution for a finite diameter well with wellbore storage in an anisotropic confined aquifer and mathieu functions were used to obtain the solutions mishra et al 2012 presented an analytical solution for a partially penetrating well with wellbore storage in an isotropic aquifer great progress has been made in the study of partially penetrating wells hantush 1957 moench 1997 1998 malama et al 2008 mishra et al 2012 feng and zhan 2015 however the models are all considered in homogeneous confined or unconfined aquifers as is well known naturally fractured aquifers play a very important role in regional water supplies according to the types of aquifers and wells we can divide models into four theoretical types 1 double porosity models for fractured confined aquifers warren and root 1963 moench 1984 1997 hamm and bidaux 1996 lods and gouze 2004 wang et al 2017 which consider the effect of crossflow between the matrix and the fractures but ignore the process of matrix flow to the wellbore 2 dual permeability considering double permeability to a fully penetrating vertical well bourdet 1985 which are based on a more realistic physical hypothesis indicating that there should be crossflow between the matrix system and the fracture system and the fluids in matrix and fracture could flow into wellbore at the same time 3 flow models for a pumping well that is partially penetrated in homogeneous confined or unconfined aquifers malama et al 2008 mishra et al 2012 feng and zhan 2015 4 double porosity models for partially penetrating pumping wells in a confined aquifer dougherty and babu 1984 in the latter model both anisotropy and connectivity from matrix to wellbore are ignored and only the infinite boundary condition is considered in their model at present dual permeability flow is an interesting research topic as far as we know there is almost no literature on the double permeability model for partially penetrating wells in confined aquifers in this article a new model considering the effect of wellbore storage and aquifer anisotropy for a partially penetrating well in dual permeability aquifers is developed to investigate the transient drawdown behavior we establish the matrix model and the fracture model respectively in which both the fracture system and the matrix system are independent flow units that can flow directly into the wellbore and crossflow is also considered the outer boundary condition could be infinite both finite fourier cosine transformation and laplace transformation are used to solve the presented dual permeability flow problem to obtain the analytical solutions the drawdown results are validated and compared with those presented in previous literatures the solution in this article can be reduced to several previously proposed results which are special cases of our results a concise outline of this paper follows in section 2 the governing equations and analytical solutions for unsteady flow to a partially penetrating pumping well in double permeability confined aquifers are presented effect of aquifer parameters on transient drawdown behavior is analyzed in section 3 conclusions are presented in section 4 2 mathematical model 2 1 model assumption in this paper we assume that a pumping well that is partially penetrated is located in fractured confined aquifers fig 1 the fractured aquifer with constant thickness is anisotropic in the r and z directions respectively detailed assumptions for the model include the following 1 the partially penetrating well has a constant rate q and a radius rw 2 both wellbore storage and skin effect are considered 3 fluids can flow from either fracture to wellbore or matrix to wellbore which is referred to dual permeability flow behavior 4 the outer boundaries of the aquifer can be considered infinite but the external boundaries of top and bottom are impermeable 5 crossflow between matrix and fracture is taken into account 6 during the process of three dimensional groundwater flow the change of temperature is ignored and 7 the initial head is the same in the matrix and fractures 2 2 establishment of the model accordingly the governing equations describing spatiotemporal head distributions in the fracture and matrix systems respectively can be

2 10 the parameters listed in eqs 51 and 52 can be found in eq 30 to 39 firstly the wellbore drawdown of the real time domain can be derived by stehfest numerical inversion 1970 then the derivative curves from figs 2 10 are calculated by the finite difference method of data points in the real time domain 3 1 solution comparison with the literature mishra et al 2012 proposed an analytical solution of a partially penetrating well in a homogeneous confined aquifer we compare the result of this paper with his solution in a particular case in our model the wellbore storage coefficient cwd is set to zero for the condition of no wellbore storage the fracture transmissivity ratio κ must be set to 0 9999 the storativity ratio ω is set to 1 for easy access to homogeneous confined aquifers the dimensionless aquifer thickness bzd is set to 30 and the penetration ratio ρ ld dd is set to 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 1 respectively with the penetration ratio equal to one the proposed model is compared with the solution of theis 1935 for a fully penetrating vertical well in confined aquifers the results are shown in fig 2 it can be seen from the semi log plot that the proposed model is validated well by the comparison with previous results in the literature which verifies the reliability of the model it is further shown in the figure that the dimensionless drawdown increases as time is added and that the penetration ratio is smaller when the dimensionless drawdown is greater suggesting that a small penetration ratio causes a large head loss 3 2 analysis of groundwater flow characteristics in dual permeability media bourdet et al 1983 presented drawdown derivative curves which have some advantages firstly drawdown curves sometimes look similar at later time but derivative curves have good character so that the non uniqueness problems sometimes encountered in type curve matching are eliminated secondly the derivative curve often changes more strongly which can more clearly reflect the flow characteristics of each time period according to the approximate formula for the later stage of radial flow bourdet et al 1983 if we choose swd to derive lntd all derivative curves are attributed to line 1 in the later stage and this makes the analysis of flow characteristics more characteristic and meaningful therefore we use the derivative curve in the analysis of this article from figs 3 10 fig 3 shows the groundwater flow characteristics in dual permeability media the dimensionless aquifer thickness bzd is set to 15 the penetration ratio ρ ld dd is set to 0 3 the wellbore storage coefficient cwd is assigned a value of 0 01 the crossflow coefficient λ is assigned a value of 0 005 the storativity ratio ω is set to 0 02 the fracture transmissivity ratio κ is set to 0 9 from the calculative results of the drawdown derivative curves the flow could be divided into five stages stage 1 the pure wellbore storage flow stage which shows the straight line of the unit slope on both the drawdown and its derivative log log plots part of the pumping well production comes from production the previously stored in the wellbore and the other part comes from the confined aquifers stage 2 early radial flow stage in which the drawdown derivative curve is the straight line of zero slope on the log log plot the duration of this stage is very short because it is affected by the dimensionless aquifer thickness and dual permeability parameters stage 3 quasi spherical flow stage in this stage the drawdown derivative curve shows a negative slope straight line it is difficult to observe this phenomenon for a small dimensionless aquifer thickness stage 4 crossflow stage during which the drawdown derivative shows one dip valley and indicates that groundwater in the matrix supplies to fractures stage 5 quasi radial flow stage in which the drawdown derivative shows a unit constant straight line and crossflow from matrix to fractures has already finished in this article the derivative is calculated in the following way in this article firstly 10 to 20 time points are selected uniformly for each logarithmic period then according to the stehfest numerical inversion method the corresponding drawdown value is obtained finally the derivative value is calculated by the finite difference method of data points in the real time domain 3 3 influence of pumping well parameters on drawdown the pumping well parameters mainly include the wellbore storage coefficient cwd and the penetration ratio ρ fig 4 shows the influence of drawdown under different wellbore storage coefficients in the calculation the fracture transmissivity ratio κ is assigned a value of 0 9 the crossflow coefficient λ is given by 0 005 the storativity ratio ω is assigned a value of 0 02 the dimensionless aquifer thickness bzd is set to 15 the penetration ratio ρ ld dd is set to 0 3 the wellbore storage coefficient cwd is assigned values of 0 01 0 1 and 1 respectively the log log plot can reflect the dual permeability flow characteristics for a pumping well that is partially penetrated in a confined aquifer as shown by the drawdown curve that when the wellbore storage coefficient is larger the drawdown is smaller when the dimensionless time is greater than 10 all of the drawdown curves coincide the log log plot shows that the drawdown and its derivative curves coincide at the wellbore storage stage some early flow stages are covered and the opening of the dip valley becomes narrow with increase of the wellbore storage coefficient which implies that the flow stage in the early and middle time can be seriously affected by wellbore storage effect in the quasi radial flow stage all drawdown derivative curves coincide the effect of the penetration ratio on drawdown is shown in fig 5 in the calculation the fracture transmissivity ratio κ is set to 0 9 the crossflow coefficient λ is assigned a value of 0 005 the storativity ratio ω is given by 0 02 the dimensionless aquifer thickness bzd is set to 15 the wellbore storage coefficient cwd is assigned a value of 0 01 and the penetration ratio ρ ld dd is set to 0 1 0 4 and 0 7 respectively the drawdown curves indicate that a smaller penetration ratio results in a greater dimensionless drawdown which implies that a smaller penetration ratio causes a larger head loss the drawdown derivative curve shows that the end time of the wellbore storage stage is almost the same under different penetration ratios with increasing penetration ratio of a pumping well the early radial flow time becomes relatively longer and the quasi spherical flow stage gradually disappears 3 4 effect of dual permeability parameters on drawdown the dual permeability parameters mainly include the crossflow coefficient λ the storativity ratio ω and the fracture transmissivity ratio κ the crossflow coefficient reflects the ability of the matrix to supply groundwater to fractures a large crossflow coefficient represents a strong supply capacity fig 6 shows the influence of the crossflow coefficient on drawdown in this analysis the fracture transmissivity ratio κ is set to 0 9 storativity ratio ω is set to 0 02 dimensionless aquifer thickness bzd is set to 15 the penetration ratio ρ ld dd is set to 0 3 the wellbore storage coefficient cwd is assigned a value of 0 01 and the crossflow coefficient λ is given by 0 005 0 02 and 0 1 respectively the log log plot of drawdown shows that groundwater flow in the middle time is affected by the crossflow coefficient and that a smaller crossflow coefficient leads to a bigger head loss which means that the supply ability from matrix to fractures is relatively weak the drawdown derivative curves suggest that the dip valley is fundamentally influenced by different crossflow coefficient the time of matrix supply to fractures is affected by the crossflow coefficient when the crossflow coefficient is larger the starting time of the supply is earlier however the supply duration is almost the same under different crossflow coefficients according to the definition of the storativity ratio ω it represents the capacity of natural fractures to store groundwater and a larger storativity ratio indicates a stronger storage capacity the effect of storativity ratio on drawdown is shown in fig 7 here the fracture transmissivity ratio κ must be set to 0 9 the dimensionless aquifer thickness bzd is set to 15 the penetration ratio ρ ld dd is set to 0 3 the wellbore storage coefficient cwd is assigned a value of 0 01 the crossflow coefficient λ is given by 0 005 and the storativity ratio ω is set to 0 01 0 02 and 0 03 respectively the drawdown semi logarithmic diagram shows that when the dimensionless time td is less than 10 a small storativity ratio leads to a large head loss which means that the ability of fractures to store groundwater is weak when the dimensionless time td is greater than 10 all of the drawdown curves coincide there is a hump and a one dip valley on the semi logarithmic curve of drawdown derivative and these are greatly related to the dual permeability flow behavior in homogeneous confined aquifers these characteristics do not appear the fracture transmissivity ratio κ is simply the ratio of fracture transmissivity tf to total fracture transmissivity t which reflects the capacity of fracture hydraulic conductivity fig 8 shows the effect of the fracture transmissivity ratio on drawdown here the dimensionless aquifer thickness bzd is set to 15 the penetration ratio ρ ld dd is set to 0 3 the wellbore storage coefficient cwd is assigned a value of 0 01 the crossflow coefficient λ is given by 0 005 storativity ratio ω is set to 0 02 and the fracture transmissivity ratio κ is set to 0 5 0 9 and 0 99 respectively the semi logarithmic plot of drawdown shows that a large transmissivity ratio causes a small head loss the drawdown derivative curve shows that the hump decreases gradually with increase of transmissivity ratio which means that the appearance of the hump is also affected by the dual permeability flow behavior in homogeneous confined aquifers and for a fully penetrating pumping well the hump completely disappears 3 5 effect of dimensionless aquifer thickness on drawdown the dimensionless aquifer thickness bzd not only shows the thickness of the aquifer but also represents the anisotropy between the horizontal direction and the vertical direction the effect of the dimensionless aquifer thickness on drawdown is shown in fig 9 here the penetration ratio ρ ld dd is set to 0 3 the wellbore storage coefficient cwd is assigned a value of 0 01 the crossflow coefficient λ is given by 0 005 the storativity ratio ω is set to 0 02 the fracture transmissivity ratio κ is set to 0 9 the dimensionless aquifer thickness bzd is set to 15 45 and 90 respectively the semi logarithmic plot of drawdown shows that a large dimensionless aquifer thickness leads to a large head loss the drawdown derivative plot shows that the larger the dimensionless aquifer thickness is the higher the hump is and the narrower the opening of the dip valley is this also implies that a large dimensionless aquifer thickness prolongs the time of quasi spherical flow and shorten the duration of inter porosity flow 3 6 effect of skin factor on drawdown in the model for eq 51 the fracture transmissivity ratio κ is set to 0 95 the crossflow coefficient λ is assigned a value of 0 005 the storativity ratio ω is given by 0 02 the dimensionless aquifer thickness bzd is set to 15 the wellbore storage coefficient cwd is assigned a value of 0 01 the penetration ratio ρ ld dd is set to 0 3 the skin factor is set to 1e 4 10 and 20 respectively the semi logarithmic plot fig 10 of drawdown shows that a large skin factor will cause a big head loss the drawdown derivative curve shows that the hump increase gradually with the increase of the skin factor which means that the appearance of the hump is also affected by the skin factor when the dimensionless time is greater than 10 all of the derivative curves coincide which also implies that for different skin factor the rate of drawdown changes with time is the same at the late time 4 conclusions this article presented a new laplace based model to study the dual permeability flow behavior for a pumping well that is partially penetrated with consideration of wellbore storage and anisotropy of the aquifer analytical solutions were obtained by laplace transformation and finite fourier cosine transformation then stehfest numerical inversion was used to derive the drawdown of the real time domain the concrete conclusions are as follows 1 the drawdown solution presented can be reduced to other solutions such as a partially penetrating pumping well in double porosity or homogenous confined aquifers or a well that is fully penetrated in infinite confined aquifers then the solutions are compared with previous solutions and the comparison showed good agreement 2 the groundwater flow characteristics for dual permeability behavior of a partially penetrating pumping well were analyzed in detail 3 the effects of pumping well parameters such as the wellbore storage coefficient and the penetration ratios were analyzed the calculated results indicated that early flow characteristics would be covered and that opening of dip valley becomes narrow as the value of wellbore storage coefficient increases with increase of penetration ratio the early radial flow time becomes relatively longer and the quasi spherical flow stage gradually disappears 4 dual permeability parameters have significant influence on the drawdown behavior of a partially penetrating pumping well it was found that the dip valley is fundamentally influenced by the crossflow flow coefficient the larger the crossflow coefficient is the earlier the starting time of supply is when the dimensionless time is less than 10 a small storativity ratio leads to a large head loss a large transmissivity ratio causes a small head loss 5 the analysis of dimensionless aquifer thickness showed that a large dimensionless aquifer thickness leads to a large head loss and prolongs the time of quasi spherical flow credit authorship contribution statement lei wang conceptualization writing original draft yangyue xiang data

5085,in this article a new model is presented for imparting unsteady flow to a partially penetrating pumping well with wellbore storage placed in double permeability confined aquifers to investigate the wellbore drawdown transient behavior in this model both the fracture and matrix systems are connected directly with the wellbore as flow pathways while comprehensively considering the crossflow between the matrix and the fractures the top and bottom boundaries are assumed to be impermeable and the outer side boundaries could be infinite subsequently laplace transformation and finite fourier cosine transformation are employed to obtain analytical solutions of the dual permeability flow model in the laplace domain the derived analytical solution is general and can be reduced to several other previous results the numerical inversion algorithm of stehfest is used to solve the wellbore drawdown in the real time domain subsequently the model is validated by comparing it with previous results groundwater flow characteristics are analyzed in detail and divided into five flow stages wellbore storage flow early radial flow quasi spherical flow crossflow between the matrix and the fractures and quasi radial flow the different flow stages show some special values on the drawdown and its derivative log log plots there is a hump dip feature in the semi logarithmic curve of the drawdown derivative which are inherent characteristic for dual permeability flow behavior the effects of some important parameters of the aquifer or pumping wells on drawdown and its derivative such as wellbore storage coefficient penetration ratio crossflow coefficient storativity ratio transmissivity ratio dimensionless aquifer thickness of anisotropy and skin factor are analyzed and discussed in detail keywords three dimensional dual permeability flow partially penetrating pumping well confined aquifers analytical solution wellbore drawdown 1 introduction in the past few decades scholars have conducted several valuable studies on the unsteady drawdown behavior of fully penetrating vertical wells in confined aquifers or unconfined aquifers neuman 1972 1974 zhan et al 2001 yeh et al 2003 zhan and bian 2006 wen et al 2006 fen and yeh 2012 kuhlman 2013 feng and zhan 2015 wang and xue 2018 during the process of a groundwater pumping test the pumping well is often partially penetrated and a three dimensional groundwater flow occurs a theoretical model for unsteady flow to a partially penetrating well was first presented by hantush 1957 who used volumetric source method to solve the flow problem of a partially penetrating well in an infinite confined aquifer moench 1997 1998 used laplace transformation to derive an analytical solution for flow to a partially penetrating pumping well with storage in a uniform and anisotropic unconfined aquifer yang and yeh 2005 proposed analytical solutions for partially penetrating well in radial composite aquifers at the constant head outer boundary condition malama et al 2008 obtained a semi analytical solution of a partial penetration well in an unconfined aquifer by using a laplace hankel transform method mishra et al 2012 proposed laplace transformation based solution of a partial penetration well and considered the effect of wellbore storage and aquifer anisotropy in their model which can be also reduced to other presented analytical results theis 1935 papadopulos and cooper 1967 yang et al 2006 based on the assumptions of the continuity condition of the aquitard aquifer interface and aquifer anisotropy feng and zhan 2015 presented a new solution for a partial penetration pumping well in a leaky confined aquifer in addition when the two factors of wellbore storage and anisotropy are considered in the model the drawdown instability behavior is very different previous scholars performed a substantial amount of research on wellbore storage and anisotropy combining them into different well models papadopulos and cooper 1967 novakowski 1989 ruud and kabala 1997 cassiani and kabala 1998 zhan et al 2001 yang and yeh 2005 mathias and butler 2007 mishra et al 2012 papadopulos and cooper 1967 presented analytical solutions for a large diameter well with the wellbore storage effect and proposed the inner boundary condition of wellbore storage novakowski 1989 proposed an analytical solution of the wellbore storage effect in two zone confined aquifers and the zone near the wellbore was considered as a finite thickness skin zone in their model ruud and kabala 1997 presented an uniform well face flux model to compute drawdown for a partially penetrated well with wellbore storage cassiani and kabala 1998 presented an analytical solution for a mixed type boundary value problem by dual integral equations and the uniform well face flux assumption was also used to calculate drawdown in their model zhan et al 2001 presented an unsteady flow model for a horizontal well in an anisotropic confined aquifer and analytical solutions were obtained in the laplace domain yang and yeh 2005 presented a two zone composite model for a partially penetrating well at a constant head condition and the anisotropy was considered into their model mathias and butler 2007 presented a laplace based solution for a finite diameter well with wellbore storage in an anisotropic confined aquifer and mathieu functions were used to obtain the solutions mishra et al 2012 presented an analytical solution for a partially penetrating well with wellbore storage in an isotropic aquifer great progress has been made in the study of partially penetrating wells hantush 1957 moench 1997 1998 malama et al 2008 mishra et al 2012 feng and zhan 2015 however the models are all considered in homogeneous confined or unconfined aquifers as is well known naturally fractured aquifers play a very important role in regional water supplies according to the types of aquifers and wells we can divide models into four theoretical types 1 double porosity models for fractured confined aquifers warren and root 1963 moench 1984 1997 hamm and bidaux 1996 lods and gouze 2004 wang et al 2017 which consider the effect of crossflow between the matrix and the fractures but ignore the process of matrix flow to the wellbore 2 dual permeability considering double permeability to a fully penetrating vertical well bourdet 1985 which are based on a more realistic physical hypothesis indicating that there should be crossflow between the matrix system and the fracture system and the fluids in matrix and fracture could flow into wellbore at the same time 3 flow models for a pumping well that is partially penetrated in homogeneous confined or unconfined aquifers malama et al 2008 mishra et al 2012 feng and zhan 2015 4 double porosity models for partially penetrating pumping wells in a confined aquifer dougherty and babu 1984 in the latter model both anisotropy and connectivity from matrix to wellbore are ignored and only the infinite boundary condition is considered in their model at present dual permeability flow is an interesting research topic as far as we know there is almost no literature on the double permeability model for partially penetrating wells in confined aquifers in this article a new model considering the effect of wellbore storage and aquifer anisotropy for a partially penetrating well in dual permeability aquifers is developed to investigate the transient drawdown behavior we establish the matrix model and the fracture model respectively in which both the fracture system and the matrix system are independent flow units that can flow directly into the wellbore and crossflow is also considered the outer boundary condition could be infinite both finite fourier cosine transformation and laplace transformation are used to solve the presented dual permeability flow problem to obtain the analytical solutions the drawdown results are validated and compared with those presented in previous literatures the solution in this article can be reduced to several previously proposed results which are special cases of our results a concise outline of this paper follows in section 2 the governing equations and analytical solutions for unsteady flow to a partially penetrating pumping well in double permeability confined aquifers are presented effect of aquifer parameters on transient drawdown behavior is analyzed in section 3 conclusions are presented in section 4 2 mathematical model 2 1 model assumption in this paper we assume that a pumping well that is partially penetrated is located in fractured confined aquifers fig 1 the fractured aquifer with constant thickness is anisotropic in the r and z directions respectively detailed assumptions for the model include the following 1 the partially penetrating well has a constant rate q and a radius rw 2 both wellbore storage and skin effect are considered 3 fluids can flow from either fracture to wellbore or matrix to wellbore which is referred to dual permeability flow behavior 4 the outer boundaries of the aquifer can be considered infinite but the external boundaries of top and bottom are impermeable 5 crossflow between matrix and fracture is taken into account 6 during the process of three dimensional groundwater flow the change of temperature is ignored and 7 the initial head is the same in the matrix and fractures 2 2 establishment of the model accordingly the governing equations describing spatiotemporal head distributions in the fracture and matrix systems respectively can be written as 1 k f 2 h f r 2 1 r h f r k z 2 h f z 2 α k m h m h f s sf h f t 2 k m 2 h m r 2 1 r h m r k z 2 h m z 2 α k m h m h f s sm h m t where km represents the matrix hydraulic conductivity of

important aquifer parameters such as wellbore storage coefficient cwd penetration ratio ρ ld dd crossflow coefficient λ storativity ratio ω fracture transmissivity ratio κ dimensionless aquifer

2 10 the parameters listed in eqs 51 and 52 can be found in eq 30 to 39 firstly the wellbore drawdown of the real time domain can be derived by stehfest numerical inversion 1970 then the derivative curves from figs 2 10 are calculated by the finite difference method of data points in the real time domain 3 1 solution comparison with the literature mishra et al 2012 proposed an analytical solution of a partially penetrating well in a homogeneous confined aquifer we compare the result of this paper with his solution in a particular case in our model the wellbore storage coefficient cwd is set to zero for the condition of no wellbore storage the fracture transmissivity ratio κ must be set to 0 9999 the storativity ratio ω is set to 1 for easy access to homogeneous confined aquifers the dimensionless aquifer thickness bzd is set to 30 and the penetration ratio ρ ld dd is set to 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 1 respectively with the penetration ratio equal to one the proposed model is compared with the solution of theis 1935 for a fully penetrating vertical well in confined aquifers the results are shown in fig 2 it can be seen from the semi log plot that the proposed model is validated well by the comparison with previous results in the literature which verifies the reliability of the model it is further shown in the figure that the dimensionless drawdown increases as time is added and that the penetration ratio is smaller when the dimensionless drawdown is greater suggesting that a small penetration ratio causes a large head loss 3 2 analysis of groundwater flow characteristics in dual permeability media bourdet et al 1983 presented drawdown derivative curves which have some advantages firstly drawdown curves sometimes look similar at later time but derivative curves have good character so that the non uniqueness problems sometimes encountered in type curve matching are eliminated secondly the derivative curve often changes more strongly which can more clearly reflect the flow characteristics of each time period according to the approximate formula for the later stage of radial flow bourdet et al 1983 if we choose swd to derive lntd all derivative curves are attributed to line 1 in the later stage and this makes the analysis of flow characteristics more characteristic and meaningful therefore we use the derivative curve in the analysis of this article from figs 3 10 fig 3 shows the groundwater flow characteristics in dual permeability media the dimensionless aquifer thickness bzd is set to 15 the penetration ratio ρ ld dd is set to 0 3 the wellbore storage coefficient cwd is assigned a value of 0 01 the crossflow coefficient λ is assigned a value of 0 005 the storativity ratio ω is set to 0 02 the fracture transmissivity ratio κ is set to 0 9 from the calculative results of the drawdown derivative curves the flow could be divided into five stages stage 1 the pure wellbore storage flow stage which shows the straight line of the unit slope on both the drawdown and its derivative log log plots part of the pumping well production comes from production the previously stored in the wellbore and the other part comes from the confined aquifers stage 2 early radial flow stage in which the drawdown derivative curve is the straight line of zero slope on the log log plot the duration of this stage is very short because it is affected by the dimensionless aquifer thickness and dual permeability parameters stage 3 quasi spherical flow stage in this stage the drawdown derivative curve shows a negative slope straight line it is difficult to observe this phenomenon for a small dimensionless aquifer thickness stage 4 crossflow stage during which the drawdown derivative shows one dip valley and indicates that groundwater in the matrix supplies to fractures stage 5 quasi radial flow stage in which the drawdown derivative shows a unit constant straight line and crossflow from matrix to fractures has already finished in this article the derivative is calculated in the following way in this article firstly 10 to 20 time points are selected uniformly for each logarithmic period then according to the stehfest numerical inversion method the corresponding drawdown value is obtained finally the derivative value is calculated by the finite difference method of data points in the real time domain 3 3 influence of pumping well parameters on drawdown the pumping well parameters mainly include the wellbore storage coefficient cwd and the penetration ratio ρ fig 4 shows the influence of drawdown under different wellbore storage coefficients in the calculation the fracture transmissivity ratio κ is assigned a value of 0 9 the crossflow coefficient λ is given by 0 005 the storativity ratio ω is assigned a value of 0 02 the dimensionless aquifer thickness bzd is set to 15 the penetration ratio ρ ld dd is set to 0 3 the wellbore storage coefficient cwd is assigned values of 0 01 0 1 and 1 respectively the log log plot can reflect the dual permeability flow characteristics for a pumping well that is partially penetrated in a confined aquifer as shown by the drawdown curve that when the wellbore storage coefficient is larger the drawdown is smaller when the dimensionless time is greater than 10 all of the drawdown curves coincide the log log plot shows that the drawdown and its derivative curves coincide at the wellbore storage stage some early flow stages are covered and the opening of the dip valley becomes narrow with increase of the wellbore storage coefficient which implies that the flow stage in the early and middle time can be seriously affected by wellbore storage effect in the quasi radial flow stage all drawdown derivative curves coincide the effect of the penetration ratio on drawdown is shown in fig 5 in the calculation the fracture transmissivity ratio κ is set to 0 9 the crossflow coefficient λ is assigned a value of 0 005 the storativity ratio ω is given by 0 02 the dimensionless aquifer thickness bzd is set to 15 the wellbore storage coefficient cwd is assigned a value of 0 01 and the penetration ratio ρ ld dd is set to 0 1 0 4 and 0 7 respectively the drawdown curves indicate that a smaller penetration ratio results in a greater dimensionless drawdown which implies that a smaller penetration ratio causes a larger head loss the drawdown derivative curve shows that the end time of the wellbore storage stage is almost the same under different penetration ratios with increasing penetration ratio of a pumping well the early radial flow time becomes relatively longer and the quasi spherical flow stage gradually disappears 3 4 effect of dual permeability parameters on drawdown the dual permeability parameters mainly include the crossflow coefficient λ the storativity ratio ω and the fracture transmissivity ratio κ the crossflow coefficient reflects the ability of the matrix to supply groundwater to fractures a large crossflow coefficient represents a strong supply capacity fig 6 shows the influence of the crossflow coefficient on drawdown in this analysis the fracture transmissivity ratio κ is set to 0 9 storativity ratio ω is set to 0 02 dimensionless aquifer thickness bzd is set to 15 the penetration ratio ρ ld dd is set to 0 3 the wellbore storage coefficient cwd is assigned a value of 0 01 and the crossflow coefficient λ is given by 0 005 0 02 and 0 1 respectively the log log plot of drawdown shows that groundwater flow in the middle time is affected by the crossflow coefficient and that a smaller crossflow coefficient leads to a bigger head loss which means that the supply ability from matrix to fractures is relatively weak the drawdown derivative curves suggest that the dip valley is fundamentally influenced by different crossflow coefficient the time of matrix supply to fractures is affected by the crossflow coefficient when the crossflow coefficient is larger the starting time of the supply is earlier however the supply duration is almost the same under different crossflow coefficients according to the definition of the storativity ratio ω it represents the capacity of natural fractures to store groundwater and a larger storativity ratio indicates a stronger storage capacity the effect of storativity ratio on drawdown is shown in fig 7 here the fracture transmissivity ratio κ must be set to 0 9 the dimensionless aquifer thickness bzd is set to 15 the penetration ratio ρ ld dd is set to 0 3 the wellbore storage coefficient cwd is assigned a value of 0 01 the crossflow coefficient λ is given by 0 005 and the storativity ratio ω is set to 0 01 0 02 and 0 03 respectively the drawdown semi logarithmic diagram shows that when the dimensionless time td is less than 10 a small storativity ratio leads to a large head loss which means that the ability of fractures to store groundwater is weak when the dimensionless time td is greater than 10 all of the drawdown curves coincide there is a hump and a one dip valley on the semi logarithmic curve of drawdown derivative and these are greatly related to the dual permeability flow behavior in homogeneous confined aquifers these characteristics do not appear the fracture transmissivity ratio κ is simply the ratio of fracture transmissivity tf to total fracture transmissivity t which reflects the capacity of fracture hydraulic conductivity fig 8 shows the effect of the fracture transmissivity ratio on drawdown here the dimensionless aquifer thickness bzd is set to 15 the penetration ratio ρ ld dd is set to 0 3 the wellbore storage coefficient cwd is assigned a value of 0 01 the crossflow coefficient λ is given by 0 005 storativity ratio ω is set to 0 02 and the fracture transmissivity ratio κ is set to 0 5 0 9 and 0 99 respectively the semi logarithmic plot of drawdown shows that a large transmissivity ratio causes a small head loss the drawdown derivative curve shows that the hump decreases gradually with increase of transmissivity ratio which means that the appearance of the hump is also affected by the dual permeability flow behavior in homogeneous confined aquifers and for a fully penetrating pumping well the hump completely disappears 3 5 effect of dimensionless aquifer thickness on drawdown the dimensionless aquifer thickness bzd not only shows the thickness of the aquifer but also represents the anisotropy between the horizontal direction and the vertical direction the effect of the dimensionless aquifer thickness on drawdown is shown in fig 9 here the penetration ratio ρ ld dd is set to 0 3 the wellbore storage coefficient cwd is assigned a value of 0 01 the crossflow coefficient λ is given by 0 005 the storativity ratio ω is set to 0 02 the fracture transmissivity ratio κ is set to 0 9 the dimensionless aquifer thickness bzd is set to 15 45 and 90 respectively the semi logarithmic plot of drawdown shows that a large dimensionless aquifer thickness leads to a large head loss the drawdown derivative plot shows that the larger the dimensionless aquifer thickness is the higher the hump is and the narrower the opening of the dip valley is this also implies that a large dimensionless aquifer thickness prolongs the time of quasi spherical flow and shorten the duration of inter porosity flow 3 6 effect of skin factor on drawdown in the model for eq 51 the fracture transmissivity ratio κ is set to 0 95 the crossflow coefficient λ is assigned a value of 0 005 the storativity ratio ω is given by 0 02 the dimensionless aquifer thickness bzd is set to 15 the wellbore storage coefficient cwd is assigned a value of 0 01 the penetration ratio ρ ld dd is set to 0 3 the skin factor is set to 1e 4 10 and 20 respectively the semi logarithmic plot fig 10 of drawdown shows that a large skin factor will cause a big head loss the drawdown derivative curve shows that the hump increase gradually with the increase of the skin factor which means that the appearance of the hump is also affected by the skin factor when the dimensionless time is greater than 10 all of the derivative curves coincide which also implies that for different skin factor the rate of drawdown changes with time is the same at the late time 4 conclusions this article presented a new laplace based model to study the dual permeability flow behavior for a pumping well that is partially penetrated with consideration of wellbore storage and anisotropy of the aquifer analytical solutions were obtained by laplace transformation and finite fourier cosine transformation then stehfest numerical inversion was used to derive the drawdown of the real time domain the concrete conclusions are as follows 1 the drawdown solution presented can be reduced to other solutions such as a partially penetrating pumping well in double porosity or homogenous confined aquifers or a well that is fully penetrated in infinite confined aquifers then the solutions are compared with previous solutions and the comparison showed good agreement 2 the groundwater flow characteristics for dual permeability behavior of a partially penetrating pumping well were analyzed in detail 3 the effects of pumping well parameters such as the wellbore storage coefficient and the penetration ratios were analyzed the calculated results indicated that early flow characteristics would be covered and that opening of dip valley becomes narrow as the value of wellbore storage coefficient increases with increase of penetration ratio the early radial flow time becomes relatively longer and the quasi spherical flow stage gradually disappears 4 dual permeability parameters have significant influence on the drawdown behavior of a partially penetrating pumping well it was found that the dip valley is fundamentally influenced by the crossflow flow coefficient the larger the crossflow coefficient is the earlier the starting time of supply is when the dimensionless time is less than 10 a small storativity ratio leads to a large head loss a large transmissivity ratio causes a small head loss 5 the analysis of dimensionless aquifer thickness showed that a large dimensionless aquifer thickness leads to a large head loss and prolongs the time of quasi spherical flow credit authorship contribution statement lei wang conceptualization writing original draft yangyue xiang data

5086,this study presents a new strategy to predict the monthly groundwater level with short and long lead times over the rafsanjan aquifer in iran using an ensemble machine learning method called gradient boosting regression gbr in this way the satellite based products including the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm and the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace datasets as well as the pumping rate are used as the predictive variables in different lag times to obtain the optimal input combinations the gamma test gt is employed as a non linear feature selection technique the spatial analysis of the performance prediction is performed using several error metrics e g r 2 and nrmse results indicate that the gbr provides a high prediction performance to predict the gwl whereas the grace product is an accurate predictive variable the correlation analysis between the predicted and observed gwl shows that the coefficient of determination values vary in the range of 0 66 to 0 94 over the different lead times the spatial pattern of the prediction accuracy indicates that the regions with higher water depth and pumping rate offer higher performance moreover the increasing trends in performance accuracy are observed from the north to south and the west to east of the rafsanjan aquifer in general the proposed approach provides a reliable insight for water resources planner to make a decision based on the accurate modeling results keywords groundwater level grace trmm gradient boosted regression prediction gamma test 1 introduction groundwater is an essential source for irrigation activities and drinking water especially in arid and semi arid areas neshat et al 2014a 2014b siebert et al 2010 todd and mays 2005 treidel et al 2011 in recent years climate change and significant population growth in developing regions have a severe impact on drinking water usage pattern which leads to gradual quality depletion and shortage in groundwater resources carlson et al 2011 chen 2019 foster et al 1994 minnig et al 2018 taylor et al 2013 wakode et al 2018 the climate change and urbanization especially in arid and semi arid regions have a direct effect on surface land cover rainfall infiltration rate surface runoff evaporation and increase of temperature which subsequently have negative consequences on groundwater supplies recharge rate and accessibility kalhor and emaminejad 2019 shahid and hazarika 2010 trichakis et al 2011 accurate groundwater modeling is complex due to nonlinearity and uncertainty associated with the effective parameters on the groundwater such as hydraulic gradient hydraulic conductivity the thickness of saturated zone hydraulic head and rate of recharge and discharge gómez hernández and gorelick 1989 the complexity of the mentioned parameters is mostly caused by changes in flowing water behaviors in porous media due to alternation of ambient soil and inaccurate estimation of observation wells recharge and discharge the numerical models have been widely used to simulate groundwater quality and quantity in the aquifers wang et al 2008 xu et al 2011 however the numerical groundwater models i e modflow include some parameters and thus preparing their appropriate values is a crucial time consuming task it needs the fieldwork and adequate experience to obtain reliable values for those parameters besides selecting the effectiveness parameters is another challenging issue during numerical groundwater modeling rushton 2004 the computational time is another concern to simulate groundwater by numerical models where it may need several days to obtain reliable results to overcome those limitations soft computing techniques are a reliable substitute to provide more accuracy with less computational time for predicting the groundwater level kermani et al 2019 ren et al 2018 in recent years artificial intelligence ai methods have been vastly used to predict the hydro system variables due to their capability to find complex mathematical relations between the target and predictive variables the artificial neural network ann is one of the most common algorithms used to forecast the gwl in past decades daliakopoulos et al 2005 mao et al 2002 nourani et al 2008 rakhshandehroo et al 2012 sreekanth et al 2009 trichakis et al 2011 likewise adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and genetic programming gp as relatively newer algorithms have been used to evaluate gwl and shown more promising accuracy than ann affandi and watanabe 2007 emamgholizadeh et al 2014 fallah mehdipour et al 2014 2013 jalalkamali et al 2010 kasiviswanathan et al 2016 maiti and tiwari 2014 mayilvaganan and naidu 2011 besides the support vector machine svm yoon et al 2016 2011 and the extreme learning machine elm yadav et al 2017 are the efficient alternatives for predicting the gwl despite the several advantages of the anns and anfis models such as estimating the unknown model parameters through simple training approaches and detecting the complicated non linear relationship between the predictors and target variable they also show some major drawbacks such as their black box nature and intense tend to overfitting dumitru and maria 2013 tu 1996 wieland and mirschel 2008 besides genetic based algorithms have superiority in well established clustering and sustaining concurrent optimization tasks but low convergence speed and less ability to detect efficiency seem to be a problem beg and islam 2016 che et al 2006 solomon et al 2014 hence several hybrid algorithms provided in previous studies in the felid of groundwater modeling to enhance the prediction performance of the stand alone artificial intelligence ai models for instance the hybrid wavelet anfis model improved the prediction performance of the gwl in term of r 2 by 8 8 in comparison with ann and by 12 5 in comparison with anfis moosavi et al 2013 zare and koch 2018 besides sujay raghavendra and deka 2015 indicated that the wavelet svr model nrmse 7 14 nse 0 91 outperform the classic svr model nrmse 12 27 nse 0 80 nourani and mousavi 2016 spatially and temporally modeled the gwl using hybrid ann rbf and anfis rbf model incorporated with a threshold based wavelet de noising method the results indicated that the de noising boosted both models performance up to 13 4 while anfis rbf is more precise than ann rbf rezaie balf et al 2017 applied a wavelet coupled mars and m5 hybrid machine learning models to increase the forecasting precision of the gwl fluctuations the w mars models provided higher accuracy than w m5 in one three and six months ahead malekzadeh et al 2019 compared the modflow elm and wavelet elm to model gwl fluctuations the results indicated that wa elm predicted the gwl with higher accuracy banadkooki et al 2020 employed a hybrid rbf and mlp machine learning models optimized by whale algorithm wa to predict the gwl fluctuations and compare the results with the classic ga algorithm results showed that the prediction performance of mlp wa in all 3 6 9 months ahead scenarios outperformed the other two algorithms although conventional machine learning models like svm and elm are widely used in many prediction or simulation studies they also manifest some disadvantages for example preprocessing the data are mandatory in the mentioned algorithms also optimizing the svm kernel function as well as the complex architecture of elm are taking considerable time and effort to train the data appropriately though the tree based models like m5 or decision tree don t need preprocessing of the input data and are easily visualized and mapped the data attributes their weak predictability significantly hinders researchers to apply them on sophisticated scientific tasks gong et al 2020 song et al 2019 the ensemble learning models combine multiple learners to decrease the prediction variance and bias at the same time bypass overfitting and enhance the prediction performance rokach 2010 zhao et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 the boosting method as a classic ensemble model outperformed svm elm and other ai methods in case of time consumption and accuracy ahmad and chen 2019 several investigations have been conducted to develop the ensemble models for predicting the gwl khalil et al 2015 showed that the wavelet ensemble ann outperformed the stand alone methods such as mlr ann and their wavelet hybrids in forecasting the short term gwl over one day week and month lead times barzegar et al 2017 predicted the gwl fluctuations utilizing the ensemble hybridization ai model consist of multi wavelet gmdh and elm models while the gmdh and elm show the maximum r 2 of 0 91 0 77 and 0 66 for predicting groundwater level in one to three months ahead respectively employing least squares boosting lsboost ensemble method increases the performance by 8 28 and 47 sahoo et al 2017 used the spectral analysis uncertainty analysis as well as machine learning to come up with an ensemble model known as hann model which outperformed both the hybrid linear as well as the non linear regression hmlr and hmnlr models since it accurately forecasted the gwl for 33 years with the negligible error of 0 4 m yadav et al 2019 proposed an ensemble method to predict the monthly gwl alternations in the municipal area of bengaluru india the ensemble model consists of pre processing the data using ga then the optimal inputs were utilized in svm and ann as predictors the results indicate that hybrid ensemble svm hsvm achieved better performance than the single ann and svm models the ensemble ai modelling also proves to be very accurate on groundwater potential mapping chen et al 2018 naghibi et al 2017 despite the limited application of artificial intelligence committee machine modeling for gwl prediction it has been widely employed to evaluate the groundwater vulnerability due to contaminators barzegar et al 2016 fijani et al 2013 nadiri et al 2017 meanwhile nadiri et al 2019 simulated the alternations of groundwater by learning from multiple fuzzy ai models and resulted in significant performance improvement compared to classic models similarly barzegar et al 2018 showed the versatility of multiple ai machine learning models in estimation of contamination of groundwater in marand plain aquifer in iran gradient boosting is a common ensemble algorithm which has been utilized in many engineering tasks namely aqi prediction miskell et al 2019 wang et al 2019 traffic jam prediction lopez martin et al 2019 finding defects in robotic sciences costa et al 2019 evaluating the soil pollution tan et al 2020 forecasting temperature of sea surface xiao et al 2019 enhancement of seismic sensors asim et al 2018 and effluent quality parameters prediction sharafati et al 2020 although the anns svms and elms have been widely used in gwl prediction the application of the ensemble learning algorithm like gbr has rarely been examined on groundwater resources monitoring to fill the mentioned gap this study aims to make use of this algorithm on the prediction of groundwater level this study intends to propose a new assessment strategy to predict gwl for one three and six months ahead over rafsanjan aquifer using various predictors such as monthly trmm rainfall grace surface water mass as well as pumping rate data in this way a new ensemble learning model named gradient boosting regression gbr is employed as a predictive model besides the best input combinations are obtained by the gamma test technique the primary motivation of the present study is to assess the performance pattern of the gbr model to predict the groundwater level over rafsanjan aquifer based on the different aspects including aquifer feature e g water depth operation condition e g pumping rate and geographical characteristics e g latitude and longitude the findings obtained from this kind of prediction performance assessment provide a reliable insight for water resources planners to prepare the efficient mitigation measures for preserving the groundwater resources over different regions of rafsanjan aquifer in the present study the study area employed satellite and proposed predictive model gbr are demonstrated in the material and methods section then the research findings are summarized and discussed through the results and discussion section 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the rafsanjan aquifer with an area of approximately 2400 km2 and mean slope of 0 85 which is located between 55 39 36 56 19 48 e and 30 15 0 30 45 0 n is selected as a case study fig 1 the rafsanjan aquifer which is an unconfined aquifer has a specific yield of 5 jaghdani and brümmer 2011 the hydraulic conductivity through the aquifer varies in the range of 0 5 to 3 m day besides the average and maximum alluvial thickness over the aquifer are 140 m and 270 m respectively rahnama and zamzam 2013 rafsanhan aquifer has anticlinal bedrock with sub part in the north south direction which mostly formed by clay sediments the groundwater direction in the aquifer is from southeast to north however it changes frequently due to topographic anomalies of bedrock southeast and western region of aquifer present the highest hydraulic gradient while the lowest value observed in southwest and north regions this region experienced yearly 90 mm for long term precipitation however in recent years it has decreased considerably due to the drought the evaporation of this area is likely to be 3000 mm mehryar et al 2015 the main crop of this region is pistachio the last 30 years saw almost 50 expansion in the overall area under cultivation however droughts and shortage of water have impeded this expansion lately mehryar et al 2016 the area considered in this study is exclusively dependent on groundwater for its irrigational requirements the yearly consumption of groundwater in the region has seen a tremendous rise from the 1970 s decade to the 1980 s decade the rise was found to be from 200 mcm to 700 mcm while the yearly discharge of groundwater was 700 mcm yr used mainly for agricultural purposes due to this immense consumption of groundwater the region had to face an annual shortfall of 200 mcm yr moreover unchecked use of groundwater reservoirs leads to a significantly lower gwl in 30 years time period motagh et al 2017 the gwl was found to be 1417 m a s l above sea level in the year 1983 while it reached 1400 m a s l in 2010 which signifies a 17 m decline in gwl motagh et al 2017 the aquifer region consists of 1427 deep wells with the yearly discharge of 756 47 mcm and 68 semi deep wells with 13 89 mcm which makes the well density nearly 0 5 per 25 square kilometres agriculture water demand with approximately 698 17 mcm is the most water consuming land usage in this region due to the low rainfall the rivers in the area are mostly seasonal and it shows the dependence of the study area to groundwater it illustrates the critical point of this research study and the role of groundwater in the area to examine the method proposed in this study the monthly groundwater level observed through the eleven observation wells over the rafsanjan aquifer from 2007 to 2016 is employed furthermore the data found from operating wells are used to obtain the average monthly pumping rate time series for each observation well region by the thiessen polygon method table 1 shows the specification of the observation wells employed in the present study from table 1 it is evident that the ground surface levels in the vicinity of the observation wells are observed to vary in the range of 1415 92 to 1660 34 m a s l besides their mean groundwater levels are found to fluctuate in the range of 1347 85 to 1549 03 m a s l hence a significant consistency is observed between the variation of groundwater level 201 m and ground surface level 244 m in rafsanjan aquifer however those variations are found in the limited ranges due to the topographical features of the rafsanjan aquifer 2 2 satellite data gravity recovery and climate experiment grace twin satellites were formulated by the collaboration of the space organizations in germany and us dlr and nasa and were launched on march 17 2002 the geo forschungs zentrum gfz potsdam thejet propulsion laboratory jpl and the university of texas center for space research csr were among the most prominent organizations involved in this formulation the satellites were found to yield accurate measurements of earth s gravitational field besides depicting detailed information about the earth s water reservoirs ice oceans and overland the distance between the grace twin satellites served as the basis for the computation of gravity the satellite is capable of revolving around the earth 15 times daily with an orbit extending to 500 km as the gravity acting on the twin satellites rises the front satellite moves faster consequently enhancing the distance between the two satellites conversely the distance between the satellites reduces as the gravity between the satellites rises the satellites were found to be approximately 220 km apart grace calculates the gravity field of earth every month for the obtained data from the satellite zero considered as the origin point and the values change around it in which the actual mass losses or gains represent negative and positive values respectively mass changes in surface exhibits as mass area 1 and also because most of the temporal variations are relevant to water mass area 1 was divided with a density of 1000 kg m 3 which lead to the generally utilized unit of equivalent water height or surface water thickness although the grace product has been widely used for measuring the changes in surface water mass it has also employed in a number of studies to simulate groundwater level changes bhanja et al 2016 rodell and famiglietti 2002 sun 2013 for instance kalhor and emaminejad 2019 used all three sources of the grace product jpl csr and gfz to assess the impact of urbanization on groundwater level and show that the satellite data are both simply accessible and accurate as an input variable tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm mission data during the years 2006 2017 has been utilized to observe the tendencies in precipitation rate data of trmm involves spatial resolution equal to 0 25 for longitude and latitude along with monthly temporal resolution the trmm was introduced as the primary earth science mission designed to study subtropical and tropical rainfall that constitutes two thirds of the overall global rainfall a variety of tools including lightning sensors radar and microwave imaging are used in the trmm satellite to facilitate the computation of rainfall the satellite was launched on the h ii rocket by tanegashima space center in the japanese space agency jaxa on november 27 1997 tropical rainfall data may be obtained by trmm satellite flying at a low orbital altitude of 400 km or 240 miles the data obtained by trmm reveals important facts about the weather and climatic conditions the monthly edition of the 3b42 dataset was based on the evaluation of rms precipitation error and rate of trmm adjusted merged microwave infrared precipitation calculated in mm hour the edition itself is known as 3b43 and was downloaded for the research fig 2 shows the observation wells w1 w11 the grid points of trmm t1 t16 and grace g1 g6 products used in the present study to obtain the trmm based precipitation and grace values at each observation wells a weighted interpolation method is used by employing the four nearest grid points hence several trmm points namely t1 t12 t13 and t16 are ignored for providing the trmm based precipitation data at the observational wells due to their locations fig 3 illustrates the mean monthly precipitation and surface water thickness anomalies obtained from trmm 3b43 and grace gfz products respectively at each grid point from fig 3a it is evident that the highest and lowest precipitation depths are observed in february and june months respectively over the grid points besides the t2 point shows the most values of precipitation depth compared to other ones fig 3b shows the highest and lowest values of surface water thickness anomalies are found in april and september respectively 2 3 gradient boosting regression gbr is an ensemble machine learning technique that is employed for making accurate forecasts by linking poor efficiency with parameterized functions in a simple manner guelman 2012 it is an iterative algorithm involving the creation of novel regression models mainly having a mutual relationship with the negative gradient of the ensemble s loss function in terms of regression modeling and classification gradient boosted regression gbr is suggested as a generalization of boosting to random loss functions it possesses many benefits such as robust output and high prediction performance fig 4 represents a schematic view of gbr modeling gbr modeling is based on the following equation 1 f x m 1 m γ m h m x where γ m stands the weak learner f x shows the additive model m indicates the number of trees and also h m x is a weak learner like decision trees having a fixed size for interacting with complex functions modelling and varicose type of data the most considerable benefits of decision trees are their ability which can construct them popular as the boosting models an additive model can be developed by gbr in contrary to other boosting algorithms as follows 2 f m x f m 1 x ϑ γ m h m x where h m shows the new tree and ϑ stands as the rate of learning that tries to minimize the loss l as truccolo and donoghue 2007 3 h m arg min h i 1 n l y i f m 1 x i h x i where n shows the total number of observed training data noted that the eq 2 can be recalculated as follows 4 f m x f m 1 x γ m i 1 n f l y i f m 1 x i where indicates the napla operator in each step for minimizing the γ m the gbr is in the form of 5 γ m arg min γ i 1 n l y i f m 1 x i γ l y i f m 1 x i f m 1 x i 2 4 gamma test gamma test gt served as an effective algorithm that could evaluate the optimum mean square error for a particular input combination even before the development of the model by determining the variance of noise present in raw data gt applies a smooth model on concealed data this allows the identification of the optimum combination of input data as well as the number of data points required for training the model gt was also verified by evans et al 2002 as per han et al 2009 the gamma statistic gt that yields the optimal value of mean square error for non linear and smooth models were described by koncar 1997 and agalbjorn et al 1997 for non linear issues the initial predictive input variables can be ranked using the gt method for choosing the optimistic predictors besides the considerable predictors can be ranked according to an index named ϑ r a t i o as following steps i consider the target values y i and the input x i where 1 i m ii calculate the delta function δ as bellow 6 δ m k 1 m i 1 m x i k x i 2 1 k p where is the distance of eulirean and x i k is the kth 1 k p i e nearest neighbors for each x i 1 i m iii compute the gamma function γ as 7 γ m k 1 2 m i 1 m y n i k y i 2 1 k p in the above relation y i k shows the proper y in the case of the k th nearest neighbor of x i in δ m k iv calculate the gamma statistic γ by taking into consideration of regression line via p points of δ m k γ m k as 8 γ a δ γ v calculate the ϑ r a t i o as below 9 ϑ r a t i o γ σ 2 y where σ 2 y shows the target outputs variance noted that the ϑ r a t i o that was in the range of 01 is the most appropriate estimation performance which prepares the zero value for this ratio the schematic view of the methodology proposed in this study is presented in fig 5 2 5 performance indices of predictive models for further assessment of the proposed models accuracy two leading statistical indices are used namely normalized root mean square error nrmse peng et al 2013 voyant et al 2014 and coefficient of determination r2 salih et al 2020 2019 sharafati et al 2019 3 results and discussion to assess the potential of the gbr model in predicting the gwl over the rafsanjan aquifer the dataset employed in the present study is divided into the training dataset 75 of total data and the testing dataset 25 of total data the monthly satellite based products including trmm mm and grace gfz cm products with 0 25 and 1 0 resolution respectively are used as the climatic predictors moreover the pumping rate is also employed as a predictive variable several input combinations are examined using the employed predictive variables with different lag times from the one month t 1 to six months prior t 6 using the gt method to predict the gwl with different lead times e g one three and six months ahead the following steps are used to obtain the most optimal input combination for each lead time t t 3 and t 6 i select the lead time ii obtain the best input combination for each well using the gt method thus eleven input combinations are obtained for all eleven observation wells iii predict the groundwater level in each well by the gbr model using those combinations all eleven input combinations obtained in step ii iv rank the input combinations used in step iii based on their performance metric and select the five most top prior combinations for each well as the nominated combinations v select a common combination nominated through all wells with the lowest predictor as the most optimal input combination for all wells vi repeat steps i to v for the other lead times table 2 demonstrates the optimal input combinations obtained by the gt method from table 2 it is clear that grace gfz is a dominant variable in all lead times employed in the present study however a significant correlation is found between the other predictive variables e g trmm and pumping rate and gwl over the longer lead times e g t 3 and t 6 considering the optimistic input combinations presented in table 2 the gwls are predicted using the gbr model table 3 provides the results of gbr prediction performances over the employed observation wells w1 w11 in the testing phase from table 3 it is evident that the gbr provides adequate accuracy to predict the gwl over all wells nrmse 0 09 to 0 22 moreover the highest performance prediction is observed in gwl predicted in one month ahead nrmse 0 09 to 0 15 while those obtained from six months ahead indicate the lowest accuracy nrmse 0 18 0 22 fig 6 compares the similarity between the predicted and observed gwl with different lead times t t 3 and t 6 for all wells w1 w11 based on the scatter plot format in the testing phase the figure indicates that an increasing spread is observed between the points of scatter plots when the lead time increases from t to t 6 on the other hand a decreasing trend is found between the gwl prediction accuracy and lead times the r 2 values obtained from plots show that the best prediction accuracy for gwl t gwl t 3 and gwl t 6 are found to be 0 938 w6 0 891 w6 and 0 699 w10 respectively the results obtained from scatter plots reveals that the gbr is an adequate model for predicting short and long term gwl to assess the spatial performance prediction of the gbr model over the rafsanjan aquifer the aquifer area is classified based on the water depth distance between the groundwater level and surface ground level and pumping rate in this way three interpolation methods namely inverse distance weighting idw spline and kriging are used to provide the water depth and pumping rate classes over the rafsanjan aquifer fig 7 as shown in fig 7 it is clear that a relative consistency is observed in patterns provided by the spline and kriging interpolation methods in both water depth fig 7b and 7c and pumping rate fig 7e and 7f classes in contrast the idw offers a different pattern in comparison with other methods e g spline and kriging to select the best interpolation method the coefficient of determination between the actual and interpolated water depth and pumping rate over the observation wells are presented in table 4 from table 4 it is obvious the highest agreement between the observed and interpolated values in both water depth r 2 0 998 and pumping rate r 2 0 999 are found in the spline method while the lowest correlation is observed in idw results r 2 0 906 for water depth and r 2 0 93 for pumping rate hence the spline method is selected to provide three classes for water depth including cw1 below 50 03 m cw2 between 50 04 88 26 m and cw3 above 88 27 m and also three other classes for pumping rate including cp1 below 423 749 m 3 year cp2 between 423 750 640 713 m 3 year and cp3 above 641 714 m 3 year those classes are presented in fig 7b and 7e from the figures it is evident that the highest pumping rate and water depth are found in the south of the rafsanjan aquifer in general an increasing trend is observed in both pumping rate and water depth from north to south of the aquifer fig 8 represents the spatial pattern of the correlation between the observed and predicted gwl over the water depth fig 8a 8c and pumping rate fig 8d 8f regions from fig 8 a c it can be seen that the similar patterns of the r 2 values are found over the different lead times t t 3 and t 6 where the highest value of the average correlation coefficient over the lead times r 2 0 806 are observed in cw3 regions while the lowest values r 2 0 779 are obtained in cw1 fig 8 d f reveals that the cp1 region provides the lowest prediction similarity for all lead times r 2 0 805 while the highest values are observed in cp3 region r 2 0 768 generally it can be concluded that a significant similarity between the predicted and observed gwl is found over the regions with heights both water depth and pumping rate to assess the spatial pattern of the prediction error over the study area fig 9 depicts the pattern of the nrmse metric for the t t 3 and t 6 lead times as shown in the figure it is obvious that cp3 nrmse 0 143 and cw3 nrmse 0 144 represent the lowest prediction error while cp1 nrmse 0 157 and cw1 nrmse 0 151 reveals to be the regions with most prediction bias for further spatial assessment of gwl prediction performance the aquifer area is divided based on 10 min bands in both longitudinal and latitudinal directions and thus fig 10 represents the variation of r 2 and nrmse metrics over the geographic bands fig 10 a c indicates that an increasing trend in r 2 value is observed in all lead times over the longitude bands generally the lowest performance prediction is seen over the central band of longitude especially in the term of nrmse index the performance metrics obtained over the latitude bands show that a relative harmony is observed in latitude bands over the different lead times where a decreasing trend in prediction performance vs increasing in latitude is found to assess the performance of the gbr in comparison with other ai models it compared with the svr model and the percentage of improvement has been computed in the groundwater level prediction at origin time t as shown in fig 11 it is clear that the gbr model profoundly improved the performance metrics in comparison with the svr model r 2 by 0 81 62 43 and nrmse by 43 41 71 02 based on the obtained gwl prediction results the application of the gbr is highly accurate even for six months ahead prediction but it seems necessary to compare and validate the findings obtained from the present study with those acquired from literature table 5 represents the comparison between the gbr algorithm used in the current study and several stand alone and hybrid ai models performed in the previous studies from the table it is evident that the gbr offers superior performance compared to other models i e hsvm eann ga and wa elm besides the input combinations used in the present study which include trmm and grace products as well as pumping rate is more diverse than other previously developed models this feature provides the capability to predict accurate groundwater levels to six months later selection of the appropriate predictors is crucial to enhance the prediction performance galelli et al 2014 maier and dandy 2000 quilty et al 2016 hence a hybrid predictive model can provide an efficient feature selection approach using the optimization methods to select suitable predictive variables furthermore the efficient tuning process based on the nature inspired optimization techniques for obtaining the model parameters in the training phase is another advantage of the hybrid ai models compared to the stand alone ones banadkooki et al 2020 salih et al 2020 sharafati et al 2019 on the other perspective regarding various ai methods for simulating the gwl this can be assumed the one particular form is not literally recommendable of the ai model for a particular problem it is clear though that a hybrid coupled models will do better than a single ai model rajaee et al 2019 the outcomes of the proposed model show correspondence with various studies which proposed that hybrid approaches were better than the standalone methods in enhancing the accuracy of forecasts gupta and barua 2018 yadav and eliza 2017 one of the main benefits of this study is that it involves the use of the gamma test as well as gbr which allows the choice of appropriate input variables as well as proper length for the training data this study shows an agreement with the studies conducted by choubin and malekian 2017 rashidi et al 2016 and jajarmizadeh et al 2015 who highlighted the significance of employing non linear models for pre processing of input variables while forecasting recently iran has been facing the issue of decline in the gwl since the existing groundwater reserves are rapidly being consumed because of the imbalance between demand and supply of groundwater in the country the excessive consumption of groundwater in the area of rafsanjan led to lower gwl the gwl even dropped by 7 m in various parts during a decade consequently issues such as groundwater shortage poor management and disappointing figures for the budget emerged such situations call for the use of gbr to make accurate forecasts about the variations in gwl and to allow better management of water reserves in the area besides providing appropriate tools for formulating operational plans but it must be ensured that gwl is accurately forecasted for better and sustainable management of groundwater reserves all across the world if the combination of remote sensing methods and gbr is done appropriately it can help the planners and other professionals associated with water management to obtain accurate outcomes this has become extremely important because of the limited global reserves of water and the immense demand for water in the field of agriculture this study has employed the time series data for examining the changes in the gwl and patterns of these changes this offers an insight into the natural hydrological and hydro geological cycles any fluctuations occurring in the natural cycles and any variation in the gwl caused because of external factors such as excessive exhaustion of groundwater resources shortage of natural water recharge and others may be identified by using these approaches in combination with the data obtained from remote sensing and ensemble machine learning model 4 conclusion in this study the groundwater level is predicted using the gradient boosting regression gbr model as an ensemble machine learning method over the rafsanjan aquifer in iran several new monthly satellite based products including trmm and grace gfz as well as the locally pumping rate for eleven observation wells are used from 2007 to 2016 as input variables to assess the potential of the gbr for predicting the short and long term gwl several lead times from the origin time t to six months ahead t 6 are considered the research findings reveal that the gbr provides high performance to predict the gwl moreover the prediction performance pattern has good consistency with the groundwater features like water depth and pumping rate where the more top prediction performances are detected over the regions with the higher water depth and pumping rate the geographical assessment of the prediction accuracy indicates that the northern region of rafsanjan aquifer provides the lowest prediction performance in contrast an increasing trend in prediction accuracy is found from the north to south of the aquifer briefly it can be said that the ensemble marching learning encompasses the optimum of each input parameter resulting in more accurate forecasting of gwl the use of gbr for gwl has the potential to yield outstanding outcomes we can thoroughly assess the performance of this novel combination technique by focusing on performing further region specific researches for various hydro geologic and climatic conditions another important point is to use satellite data from grace and trmm which are used in a limited way in the regional scale they can help researchers to obtain groundwater level prediction as well as monitor the study area which is a perfect and handy tool the methods proposed in this research may prove beneficial for conducting future examinations for determining the most appropriate way that may be applied for the long term to yield improved outcomes this research recommends efficient methods for keeping a check on the available reservoirs of groundwater and may be useful for spreading awareness about environmental resources as limitations the prediction modeling proposed in the present study is only adopted in a semi arid climate region however conducting the proposed approach on other climate regions provides an additional perspicacious sense for the groundwater prediction besides thought satellite based data are proved to be a handy tool for predicting the gwl their biases and uncertainty associated with those products are the major limitations of the satellite products employed in prediction modeling hence further studies can be adopted to assess the effect of the bias correction of the products on reducing the error propagation through gwl prediction modeling also although the prediction modeling performed in the current study offers adequate performance considering the other satellite based products as the predictive variables may be improved the prediction performance thus those limitations can be used as topics to adopt future studies

5086,this study presents a new strategy to predict the monthly groundwater level with short and long lead times over the rafsanjan aquifer in iran using an ensemble machine learning method called gradient boosting regression gbr in this way the satellite based products including the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm and the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace datasets as well as the pumping rate are used as the predictive variables in different lag times to obtain the optimal input combinations the gamma test gt is employed as a non linear feature selection technique the spatial analysis of the performance prediction is performed using several error metrics e g r 2 and nrmse results indicate that the gbr provides a high prediction performance to predict the gwl whereas the grace product is an accurate predictive variable the correlation analysis between the predicted and observed gwl shows that the coefficient of determination values vary in the range of 0 66 to 0 94 over the different lead times the spatial pattern of the prediction accuracy indicates that the regions with higher water depth and pumping rate offer higher performance moreover the increasing trends in performance accuracy are observed from the north to south and the west to east of the rafsanjan aquifer in general the proposed approach provides a reliable insight for water resources planner to make a decision based on the accurate modeling results keywords groundwater level grace trmm gradient boosted regression prediction gamma test 1 introduction groundwater is an essential source for irrigation activities and drinking water especially in arid and semi arid areas neshat et al 2014a 2014b siebert et al 2010 todd and mays 2005 treidel et al 2011 in recent years climate change and significant population growth in developing regions have a severe impact on drinking water usage pattern which leads to gradual quality depletion and shortage in groundwater resources carlson et al 2011 chen 2019 foster et al 1994 minnig et al 2018 taylor et al 2013 wakode et al 2018 the climate change and urbanization especially in arid and semi arid regions have a direct effect on surface land cover rainfall infiltration rate surface runoff evaporation and increase of temperature which subsequently have negative consequences on groundwater supplies recharge rate and accessibility kalhor and emaminejad 2019 shahid and hazarika 2010 trichakis et al 2011 accurate groundwater modeling is complex due to nonlinearity and uncertainty associated with the effective parameters on the groundwater such as hydraulic gradient hydraulic conductivity the thickness of saturated zone hydraulic head and rate of recharge and discharge gómez hernández and gorelick 1989 the complexity of the mentioned parameters is mostly caused by changes in flowing water behaviors in porous media due to alternation of ambient soil and inaccurate estimation of observation wells recharge and discharge the numerical models have been widely used to simulate groundwater quality and quantity in the aquifers wang et al 2008 xu et al 2011 however the numerical groundwater models i e modflow include some parameters and thus preparing their appropriate values is a crucial time consuming task it needs the fieldwork and adequate experience to obtain reliable values for those parameters besides selecting the effectiveness parameters is another challenging issue during numerical groundwater modeling rushton 2004 the computational time is another concern to simulate groundwater by numerical models where it may need several days to obtain reliable results to overcome those limitations soft computing techniques are a reliable substitute to provide more accuracy with less computational time for predicting the groundwater level kermani et al 2019 ren et al 2018 in recent years artificial intelligence ai methods have been vastly used to predict the hydro system variables due to their capability to find complex mathematical relations between the target and predictive variables the artificial neural network ann is one of the most common algorithms used to forecast the gwl in past decades daliakopoulos et al 2005 mao et al 2002 nourani et al 2008 rakhshandehroo et al 2012 sreekanth et al 2009 trichakis et al 2011 likewise adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and genetic programming gp as relatively newer algorithms have been used to evaluate gwl and shown more promising accuracy than ann affandi and watanabe 2007 emamgholizadeh et al 2014 fallah mehdipour et al 2014 2013 jalalkamali et al 2010 kasiviswanathan et al 2016 maiti and tiwari 2014 mayilvaganan and naidu 2011 besides the support vector machine svm yoon et al 2016 2011 and the extreme learning machine elm yadav et al 2017 are the efficient alternatives for predicting the gwl despite the several advantages of the anns and anfis models such as estimating the unknown model parameters through simple training approaches and detecting the complicated non linear relationship between the predictors and target variable they also show some major drawbacks such as their black box nature and intense tend to overfitting dumitru and maria 2013 tu 1996 wieland and mirschel 2008 besides genetic based algorithms have superiority in well established clustering and sustaining concurrent optimization tasks but low convergence speed and less ability to detect efficiency seem to be a problem beg and islam 2016 che et al 2006 solomon et al 2014 hence several hybrid algorithms provided in previous studies in the felid of groundwater modeling to enhance the prediction performance of the stand alone artificial intelligence ai models for instance the hybrid wavelet anfis model improved the prediction performance of the gwl in term of r 2 by 8 8 in comparison with ann and by 12 5 in comparison with anfis moosavi et al 2013 zare and koch 2018 besides sujay raghavendra and deka 2015 indicated that the wavelet svr model nrmse 7 14 nse 0 91 outperform the classic svr model nrmse 12 27 nse 0 80 nourani and mousavi 2016 spatially and temporally modeled the gwl using hybrid ann rbf and anfis rbf model incorporated with a threshold based wavelet de noising method the results indicated that the de noising boosted both models performance up to 13 4 while anfis rbf is more precise than ann rbf rezaie balf et al 2017 applied a wavelet coupled mars and m5 hybrid machine learning models to increase the forecasting precision of the gwl fluctuations the w mars models provided higher accuracy than w m5 in one three and six months ahead malekzadeh et al 2019 compared the modflow elm and wavelet elm to model gwl fluctuations the results indicated that wa elm predicted the gwl with higher accuracy banadkooki et al 2020 employed a hybrid rbf and mlp machine learning models optimized by whale algorithm wa to predict the gwl fluctuations and compare the results with the classic ga algorithm results showed that the prediction performance of mlp wa in all 3 6 9 months ahead scenarios outperformed the other two algorithms although conventional machine learning models like svm and elm are widely used in many prediction or simulation studies they also manifest some disadvantages for example preprocessing the data are mandatory in the mentioned algorithms also optimizing the svm kernel function as well as the complex architecture of elm are taking considerable time and effort to train the data appropriately though the tree based models like m5 or decision tree don t need preprocessing of the input data and are easily visualized and mapped the data attributes their weak predictability significantly hinders researchers to apply them on sophisticated scientific tasks gong et al 2020 song et al 2019 the ensemble learning models combine multiple learners to decrease the prediction variance and bias at the same time bypass overfitting and enhance the prediction performance rokach 2010 zhao et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 the boosting method as a classic ensemble model outperformed svm elm and other ai methods in case of time consumption and accuracy ahmad and chen 2019 several investigations have been conducted to develop the ensemble models for predicting the gwl khalil et al 2015 showed that the wavelet ensemble ann outperformed the stand alone methods such as mlr ann and their wavelet hybrids in forecasting the short term gwl over one day week and month lead times barzegar et al 2017 predicted the gwl fluctuations utilizing the ensemble hybridization ai model consist of multi wavelet gmdh and elm models while the gmdh and elm show the maximum r 2 of 0 91 0 77 and 0 66 for predicting groundwater level in one to three months ahead respectively employing least squares boosting lsboost ensemble method increases the performance by 8 28 and 47 sahoo et al 2017 used the spectral analysis uncertainty analysis as well as machine learning to come up with an ensemble model known as hann model which outperformed both the hybrid linear as well as the non linear regression hmlr and hmnlr models since it accurately forecasted the gwl for 33 years with the negligible error of 0 4 m yadav et al 2019 proposed an ensemble method to predict the monthly gwl alternations in the municipal area of bengaluru india the ensemble model consists of pre processing the data using ga then the optimal inputs were utilized in svm and ann as predictors the results indicate that hybrid ensemble svm hsvm achieved better performance than the single ann and svm models the ensemble ai modelling also proves to be very accurate on groundwater potential mapping chen et al 2018 naghibi et al 2017 despite the limited application of artificial intelligence committee machine modeling for gwl prediction it has been widely employed to evaluate the groundwater vulnerability due to contaminators barzegar et al 2016 fijani et al 2013 nadiri et al 2017 meanwhile nadiri et al 2019 simulated the alternations of groundwater by learning from multiple fuzzy ai models and resulted in significant performance improvement compared to classic models similarly barzegar et al 2018 showed the versatility of multiple ai machine learning models in estimation of contamination of groundwater in marand plain aquifer in iran gradient boosting is a common ensemble algorithm which has been utilized in many engineering tasks namely aqi prediction miskell et al 2019 wang et al 2019 traffic jam prediction lopez martin et al 2019 finding defects in robotic sciences costa et al 2019 evaluating the soil pollution tan et al 2020 forecasting temperature of sea surface xiao et al 2019 enhancement of seismic sensors asim et al 2018 and effluent quality parameters prediction sharafati et al 2020 although the anns svms and elms have been widely used in gwl prediction the application of the ensemble learning algorithm like gbr has rarely been examined on groundwater resources monitoring to fill the mentioned gap this study aims to make use of this algorithm on the prediction of groundwater level this study intends to propose a new assessment strategy to predict gwl for one three and six months ahead over rafsanjan aquifer using various predictors such as monthly trmm rainfall grace surface water mass as well as pumping rate data in this way a new ensemble learning model named gradient boosting regression gbr is employed as a predictive model besides the best input combinations are obtained by the gamma test technique the primary motivation of the present study is to assess the performance pattern of the gbr model to predict the groundwater level over rafsanjan aquifer based on the different aspects including aquifer feature e g water depth operation condition e g pumping rate and geographical characteristics e g latitude and longitude the findings obtained from this kind of prediction performance assessment provide a reliable insight for water resources planners to prepare the efficient mitigation measures for preserving the groundwater resources over different regions of rafsanjan aquifer in the present study the study area employed satellite and proposed predictive model gbr are demonstrated in the material and methods section then the research findings are summarized and discussed through the results and discussion section 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the rafsanjan aquifer with an area of approximately 2400 km2 and mean slope of 0 85 which is located between 55 39 36 56 19 48 e and 30 15 0 30 45 0 n is selected as a case study fig 1 the rafsanjan aquifer which is an unconfined aquifer has a specific yield of 5 jaghdani and brümmer 2011 the hydraulic conductivity through the aquifer varies in the range of 0 5 to 3 m day besides the average and maximum alluvial thickness over the aquifer are 140 m and 270 m respectively rahnama and zamzam 2013 rafsanhan aquifer has anticlinal bedrock with sub part in the north south direction which mostly formed by clay sediments the groundwater direction in the aquifer is from southeast to north however it changes frequently due to topographic anomalies of bedrock southeast and western region of aquifer present the highest hydraulic gradient while the lowest value observed in southwest and north regions this region experienced yearly 90 mm for long term precipitation however in recent years it has decreased considerably due to the drought the evaporation of this area is likely to be 3000 mm mehryar et al 2015 the main crop of this region is pistachio the last 30 years saw almost 50 expansion in the overall area under cultivation however droughts and shortage of water have impeded this expansion lately mehryar et al 2016 the area considered in this study is exclusively dependent on groundwater for its irrigational requirements the yearly consumption of groundwater in the region has seen a tremendous rise from the 1970 s decade to the 1980 s decade the rise was found to be from 200 mcm to 700 mcm while the yearly discharge of groundwater was 700 mcm yr used mainly for agricultural purposes due to this immense consumption of groundwater the region had to face an annual shortfall of 200 mcm yr moreover unchecked use of groundwater reservoirs leads to a significantly lower gwl in 30 years time period motagh et al 2017 the gwl was found to be 1417 m a s l above sea level in the year 1983 while it reached 1400 m a s l in 2010 which signifies a 17 m decline in gwl motagh et al 2017 the aquifer region consists of 1427 deep wells with the yearly discharge of 756 47 mcm and 68 semi deep wells with 13 89 mcm which makes the well density nearly 0 5 per 25 square kilometres agriculture water demand with approximately 698 17 mcm is the most water consuming land usage in this region due to the low rainfall the rivers in the area are mostly seasonal and it shows the dependence of the study area to groundwater it illustrates the critical point of this research study and the role of groundwater in the area to examine the method proposed in this study the monthly groundwater level observed through the eleven observation wells over the rafsanjan aquifer from 2007 to 2016 is employed furthermore the data found from operating wells are used to obtain the average monthly pumping rate time series for each observation well region by the thiessen polygon method table 1 shows the specification of the observation wells employed in the present study from table 1 it is evident that the ground surface levels in the vicinity of the observation wells are observed to vary in the range of 1415 92 to 1660 34 m a s l besides their mean groundwater levels are found to fluctuate in the range of 1347 85 to 1549 03 m a s l hence a significant consistency is observed between the variation of groundwater level 201 m and ground surface level 244 m in rafsanjan aquifer however those variations are found in the limited ranges due to the topographical features of the rafsanjan aquifer 2 2 satellite data gravity recovery and climate experiment grace twin satellites were formulated by the collaboration of the space organizations in germany and us dlr and nasa and were launched on march 17 2002 the geo forschungs zentrum gfz potsdam thejet propulsion laboratory jpl and the university of texas center for space research csr were among the most prominent organizations involved in this formulation the satellites were found to yield accurate measurements of earth s gravitational field besides depicting detailed information about the earth s water reservoirs ice oceans and overland the distance between the grace twin satellites served as the basis for the computation of gravity the satellite is capable of revolving around the earth 15 times daily with an orbit extending to 500 km as the gravity acting on the twin satellites rises the front satellite moves faster consequently enhancing the distance between the two satellites conversely the distance between the satellites reduces as the gravity between the satellites rises the satellites were found to be approximately 220 km apart grace calculates the gravity field of earth every month for the obtained data from the satellite zero considered as the origin point and the values change around it in which the actual mass losses or gains represent negative and positive values respectively mass changes in surface exhibits as mass area 1 and also because most of the temporal variations are relevant to water mass area 1 was divided with a density of 1000 kg m 3 which lead to the generally utilized unit of equivalent water height or surface water thickness although the grace product has been widely used for measuring the changes in surface water mass it has also employed in a number of studies to simulate groundwater level changes bhanja et al 2016 rodell and famiglietti 2002 sun 2013 for instance kalhor and emaminejad 2019 used all three sources of the grace product jpl csr and gfz to assess the impact of urbanization on groundwater level and show that the satellite data are both simply accessible and accurate as an input variable tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm mission data during the years 2006 2017 has been utilized to observe the tendencies in precipitation rate data of trmm involves spatial resolution equal to 0 25 for longitude and latitude along with monthly temporal resolution the trmm was introduced as the primary earth science mission designed to study subtropical and tropical rainfall that constitutes two thirds of the overall global rainfall a variety of tools including lightning sensors radar and microwave imaging are used in the trmm satellite to facilitate the computation of rainfall the satellite was launched on the h ii rocket by tanegashima space center in the japanese space agency jaxa on november 27 1997 tropical rainfall data may be obtained by trmm satellite flying at a low orbital altitude of 400 km or 240 miles the data obtained by trmm reveals important facts about the weather and climatic conditions the monthly edition of the 3b42 dataset was based on the evaluation of rms precipitation error and rate of trmm adjusted merged microwave infrared precipitation calculated in mm hour the edition itself is known as 3b43 and was downloaded for the research fig 2 shows the observation wells w1 w11 the grid points of trmm t1 t16 and grace g1 g6 products used in the present study to obtain the trmm based precipitation and grace values at each observation wells a weighted interpolation method is used by employing the four nearest grid points hence several trmm points namely t1 t12 t13 and t16 are ignored for providing the trmm based precipitation data at the observational wells due to their locations fig 3 illustrates the mean monthly precipitation and surface water thickness anomalies obtained from trmm 3b43 and grace gfz products respectively at each grid point from fig 3a it is evident that the highest and lowest precipitation depths are observed in february and june months respectively over the grid points besides the t2 point shows the most values of precipitation depth compared to other ones fig 3b shows the highest and lowest values of surface water thickness anomalies are found in april and september respectively 2 3 gradient boosting regression gbr is an ensemble machine learning technique that is employed for making accurate forecasts by linking poor efficiency with parameterized functions in a simple manner guelman 2012 it is an iterative algorithm involving the creation of novel regression models mainly having a mutual relationship with the negative gradient of the ensemble s loss function in terms of regression modeling and classification gradient boosted regression gbr is suggested as a generalization of boosting to random loss functions it possesses many benefits such as robust output and high prediction performance fig 4 represents a schematic view of gbr modeling gbr modeling is based on the following equation 1 f x m 1 m γ m h m x where γ m stands the weak learner f x shows the additive model m indicates the number of trees and also h m x is a weak learner like decision trees having a fixed size for interacting with complex functions modelling and varicose type of data the most considerable benefits of decision trees are their ability which can construct them popular as the boosting models an additive model can be developed by gbr in contrary to other boosting algorithms as follows 2 f m x f m 1 x ϑ γ m h m x where h m shows the new tree and ϑ stands as the rate of learning that tries to minimize the loss l as truccolo and donoghue 2007 3 h m arg min h i 1 n l y i f m 1 x i h x i where n shows the total number of observed training data noted that the eq 2 can be recalculated as follows 4 f m x f m 1 x γ m i 1 n f l y i f m 1 x i where indicates the napla operator in each step for minimizing the γ m the gbr is in the form of 5 γ m arg min γ i 1 n l y i f m 1 x i γ l y i f m 1 x i f m 1 x i 2 4 gamma test gamma test gt served as an effective algorithm that could evaluate the optimum mean square error for a particular input combination even before the development of the model by determining the variance of noise present in raw data gt applies a smooth model on concealed data this allows the identification of the optimum combination of input data as well as the number of data points required for training the model gt was also verified by evans et al 2002 as per han et al 2009 the gamma statistic gt that yields the optimal value of mean square error for non linear and smooth models were described by koncar 1997 and agalbjorn et al 1997 for non linear issues the initial predictive input variables can be ranked using the gt method for choosing the optimistic predictors besides the considerable predictors can be ranked according to an index named ϑ r a t i o as following steps i consider the target values y i and the input x i where 1 i m ii calculate the delta function δ as bellow 6 δ m k 1 m i 1 m x i k x i 2 1 k p where is the distance of eulirean and x i k is the kth 1 k p i e nearest neighbors for each x i 1 i m iii compute the gamma function γ as 7 γ m k 1 2 m i 1 m y n i k y i 2 1 k p in the above relation y i k shows the proper y in the case of the k th nearest neighbor of x i in δ m k iv calculate the gamma statistic γ by taking into consideration of regression line via p points of δ m k γ m k as 8 γ a δ γ v calculate the ϑ r a t i o as below 9 ϑ r a t i o γ σ 2 y where σ 2 y shows the target outputs variance noted that the ϑ r a t i o that was in the range of 01 is the most appropriate estimation performance which prepares the zero value for this ratio the schematic view of the methodology proposed in this study is presented in fig 5 2 5 performance indices of predictive models for further assessment of the proposed models accuracy two leading statistical indices are used namely normalized root mean square error nrmse peng et al 2013 voyant et al 2014 and coefficient of determination r2 salih et al 2020 2019 sharafati et al 2019 3 results and discussion to assess the potential of the gbr model in predicting the gwl over the rafsanjan aquifer the dataset employed in the present study is divided into the training dataset 75 of total data and the testing dataset 25 of total data the monthly satellite based products including trmm mm and grace gfz cm products with 0 25 and 1 0 resolution respectively are used as the climatic predictors moreover the pumping rate is also employed as a predictive variable several input combinations are examined using the employed predictive variables with different lag times from the one month t 1 to six months prior t 6 using the gt method to predict the gwl with different lead times e g one three and six months ahead the following steps are used to obtain the most optimal input combination for each lead time t t 3 and t 6 i select the lead time ii obtain the best input combination for each well using the gt method thus eleven input combinations are obtained for all eleven observation wells iii predict the groundwater level in each well by the gbr model using those combinations all eleven input combinations obtained in step ii iv rank the input combinations used in step iii based on their performance metric and select the five most top prior combinations for each well as the nominated combinations v select a common combination nominated through all wells with the lowest predictor as the most optimal input combination for all wells vi repeat steps i to v for the other lead times table 2 demonstrates the optimal input combinations obtained by the gt method from table 2 it is clear that grace gfz is a dominant variable in all lead times employed in the present study however a significant correlation is found between the other predictive variables e g trmm and pumping rate and gwl over the longer lead times e g t 3 and t 6 considering the optimistic input combinations presented in table 2 the gwls are predicted using the gbr model table 3 provides the results of gbr prediction performances over the employed observation wells w1 w11 in the testing phase from table 3 it is evident that the gbr provides adequate accuracy to predict the gwl over all wells nrmse 0 09 to 0 22 moreover the highest performance prediction is observed in gwl predicted in one month ahead nrmse 0 09 to 0 15 while those obtained from six months ahead indicate the lowest accuracy nrmse 0 18 0 22 fig 6 compares the similarity between the predicted and observed gwl with different lead times t t 3 and t 6 for all wells w1 w11 based on the scatter plot format in the testing phase the figure indicates that an increasing spread is observed between the points of scatter plots when the lead time increases from t to t 6 on the other hand a decreasing trend is found between the gwl prediction accuracy and lead times the r 2 values obtained from plots show that the best prediction accuracy for gwl t gwl t 3 and gwl t 6 are found to be 0 938 w6 0 891 w6 and 0 699 w10 respectively the results obtained from scatter plots reveals that the gbr is an adequate model for predicting short and long term gwl to assess the spatial performance prediction of the gbr model over the rafsanjan aquifer the aquifer area is classified based on the water depth distance between the groundwater level and surface ground level and pumping rate in this way three interpolation methods namely inverse distance weighting idw spline and kriging are used to provide the water depth and pumping rate classes over the rafsanjan aquifer fig 7 as shown in fig 7 it is clear that a relative consistency is observed in patterns provided by the spline and kriging interpolation methods in both water depth fig 7b and 7c and pumping rate fig 7e and 7f classes in contrast the idw offers a different pattern in comparison with other methods e g spline and kriging to select the best interpolation method the coefficient of determination between the actual and interpolated water depth and pumping rate over the observation wells are presented in table 4 from table 4 it is obvious the highest agreement between the observed and interpolated values in both water depth r 2 0 998 and pumping rate r 2 0 999 are found in the spline method while the lowest correlation is observed in idw results r 2 0 906 for water depth and r 2 0 93 for pumping rate hence the spline method is selected to provide three classes for water depth including cw1 below 50 03 m cw2 between 50 04 88 26 m and cw3 above 88 27 m and also three other classes for pumping rate including cp1 below 423 749 m 3 year cp2 between 423 750 640 713 m 3 year and cp3 above 641 714 m 3 year those classes are presented in fig 7b and 7e from the figures it is evident that the highest pumping rate and water depth are found in the south of the rafsanjan aquifer in general an increasing trend is observed in both pumping rate and water depth from north to south of the aquifer fig 8 represents the spatial pattern of the correlation between the observed and predicted gwl over the water depth fig 8a 8c and pumping rate fig 8d 8f regions from fig 8 a c it can be seen that the similar patterns of the r 2 values are found over the different lead times t t 3 and t 6 where the highest value of the average correlation coefficient over the lead times r 2 0 806 are observed in cw3 regions while the lowest values r 2 0 779 are obtained in cw1 fig 8 d f reveals that the cp1 region provides the lowest prediction similarity for all lead times r 2 0 805 while the highest values are observed in cp3 region r 2 0 768 generally it can be concluded that a significant similarity between the predicted and observed gwl is found over the regions with heights both water depth and pumping rate to assess the spatial pattern of the prediction error over the study area fig 9 depicts the pattern of the nrmse metric for the t t 3 and t 6 lead times as shown in the figure it is obvious that cp3 nrmse 0 143 and cw3 nrmse 0 144 represent the lowest prediction error while cp1 nrmse 0 157 and cw1 nrmse 0 151 reveals to be the regions with most prediction bias for further spatial assessment of gwl prediction performance the aquifer area is divided based on 10 min bands in both longitudinal and latitudinal directions and thus fig 10 represents the variation of r 2 and nrmse metrics over the geographic bands fig 10 a c indicates that an increasing trend in r 2 value is observed in all lead times over the longitude bands generally the lowest performance prediction is seen over the central band of longitude especially in the term of nrmse index the performance metrics obtained over the latitude bands show that a relative harmony is observed in latitude bands over the different lead times where a decreasing trend in prediction performance vs increasing in latitude is found to assess the performance of the gbr in comparison with other ai models it compared with the svr model and the percentage of improvement has been computed in the groundwater level prediction at origin time t as shown in fig 11 it is clear that the gbr model profoundly improved the performance metrics in comparison with the svr model r 2 by 0 81 62 43 and nrmse by 43 41 71 02 based on the obtained gwl prediction results the application of the gbr is highly accurate even for six months ahead prediction but it seems necessary to compare and validate the findings obtained from the present study with those acquired from literature table 5 represents the comparison between the gbr algorithm used in the current study and several stand alone and hybrid ai models performed in the previous studies from the table it is evident that the gbr offers superior performance compared to other models i e hsvm eann ga and wa elm besides the input combinations used in the present study which include trmm and grace products as well as pumping rate is more diverse than other previously developed models this feature provides the capability to predict accurate groundwater levels to six months later selection of the appropriate predictors is crucial to enhance the prediction performance galelli et al 2014 maier and dandy 2000 quilty et al 2016 hence a hybrid predictive model can provide an efficient feature selection approach using the optimization methods to select suitable predictive variables furthermore the efficient tuning process based on the nature inspired optimization techniques for obtaining the model parameters in the training phase is another advantage of the hybrid ai models compared to the stand alone ones banadkooki et al 2020 salih et al 2020 sharafati et al 2019 on the other perspective regarding various ai methods for simulating the gwl this can be assumed the one particular form is not literally recommendable of the ai model for a particular problem it is clear though that a hybrid coupled models will do better than a single ai model rajaee et al 2019 the outcomes of the proposed model show correspondence with various studies which proposed that hybrid approaches were better than the standalone methods in enhancing the accuracy of forecasts gupta and barua 2018 yadav and eliza 2017 one of the main benefits of this study is that it involves the use of the gamma test as well as gbr which allows the choice of appropriate input variables as well as proper length for the training data this study shows an agreement with the studies conducted by choubin and malekian 2017 rashidi et al 2016 and jajarmizadeh et al 2015 who highlighted the significance of employing non linear models for pre processing of input variables while forecasting recently iran has been facing the issue of decline in the gwl since the existing groundwater reserves are rapidly being consumed because of the imbalance between demand and supply of groundwater in the country the excessive consumption of groundwater in the area of rafsanjan led to lower gwl the gwl even dropped by 7 m in various parts during a decade consequently issues such as groundwater shortage poor management and disappointing figures for the budget emerged such situations call for the use of gbr to make accurate forecasts about the variations in gwl and to allow better management of water reserves in the area besides providing appropriate tools for formulating operational plans but it must be ensured that gwl is accurately forecasted for better and sustainable management of groundwater reserves all across the world if the combination of remote sensing methods and gbr is done appropriately it can help the planners and other professionals associated with water management to obtain accurate outcomes this has become extremely important because of the limited global reserves of water and the immense demand for water in the field of agriculture this study has employed the time series data for examining the changes in the gwl and patterns of these changes this offers an insight into the natural hydrological and hydro geological cycles any fluctuations occurring in the natural cycles and any variation in the gwl caused because of external factors such as excessive exhaustion of groundwater resources shortage of natural water recharge and others may be identified by using these approaches in combination with the data obtained from remote sensing and ensemble machine learning model 4 conclusion in this study the groundwater level is predicted using the gradient boosting regression gbr model as an ensemble machine learning method over the rafsanjan aquifer in iran several new monthly satellite based products including trmm and grace gfz as well as the locally pumping rate for eleven observation wells are used from 2007 to 2016 as input variables to assess the potential of the gbr for predicting the short and long term gwl several lead times from the origin time t to six months ahead t 6 are considered the research findings reveal that the gbr provides high performance to predict the gwl moreover the prediction performance pattern has good consistency with the groundwater features like water depth and pumping rate where the more top prediction performances are detected over the regions with the higher water depth and pumping rate the geographical assessment of the prediction accuracy indicates that the northern region of rafsanjan aquifer provides the lowest prediction performance in contrast an increasing trend in prediction accuracy is found from the north to south of the aquifer briefly it can be said that the ensemble marching learning encompasses the optimum of each input parameter resulting in more accurate forecasting of gwl the use of gbr for gwl has the potential to yield outstanding outcomes we can thoroughly assess the performance of this novel combination technique by focusing on performing further region specific researches for various hydro geologic and climatic conditions another important point is to use satellite data from grace and trmm which are used in a limited way in the regional scale they can help researchers to obtain groundwater level prediction as well as monitor the study area which is a perfect and handy tool the methods proposed in this research may prove beneficial for conducting future examinations for determining the most appropriate way that may be applied for the long term to yield improved outcomes this research recommends efficient methods for keeping a check on the available reservoirs of groundwater and may be useful for spreading awareness about environmental resources as limitations the prediction modeling proposed in the present study is only adopted in a semi arid climate region however conducting the proposed approach on other climate regions provides an additional perspicacious sense for the groundwater prediction besides thought satellite based data are proved to be a handy tool for predicting the gwl their biases and uncertainty associated with those products are the major limitations of the satellite products employed in prediction modeling hence further studies can be adopted to assess the effect of the bias correction of the products on reducing the error propagation through gwl prediction modeling also although the prediction modeling performed in the current study offers adequate performance considering the other satellite based products as the predictive variables may be improved the prediction performance thus those limitations can be used as topics to adopt future studies

5087,streamflow has been complexly altered by climate change and human activities in major rivers worldwide the traditional darwinian approach for impact assessment of climate change and human activities mainly focuses on variations in annual streamflow but ignores other critical streamflow characteristics e g high and low flow signatures in our study seven streamflow metrics were adopted to characterize the main streamflow signatures including average low and high flows and the budyko based method was extended based on the derived differential equation of streamflow signature change to separate individual impacts of climate change and human activities the yellow river basin china was selected as the study area because of its high intensity of human activities and daily runoff observation series from 1960 to 2015 at four stations from the source region to the downstream region were used for the assessment the assessment results were also compared with those estimated by the hydrological modeling method for validation the results show that all streamflow signatures at the four stations have evidently declined after the 1980s particularly for high flow magnitudes both climate change and human activities decrease most of streamflow signatures and human activities play major roles which are gradually enhanced from the source region to the downstream region the contributions of human activities are from 66 85 to 56 68 in the tangnaihai controlled catchment from 96 93 to 54 59 in the qingtongxia controlled catchment from 83 61 to 57 49 in the longmen controlled catchment and from 91 02 to 57 29 in the lijin controlled catchment the most impacted signature is the average flow in the non flood season followed by the annual maximum flow the estimated contributions of climate change and human activities match well with those estimated by the hydrological modeling method particularly for the high and average flow signatures with contribution deviations less than 10 however the estimated contributions to the low flow signatures are quite different likely due to large uncertainty of low flow estimation this study is expected to provide insights into the streamflow variations basin wide and provide scientific foundations for ecological protection and high quality development of the yellow river basin china keywords streamflow signatures climate change human activities budyko hypothesis attribution analysis yellow river basin 1 introduction streamflow of the global major rivers has been complexly altered resulting in the degradation of water quality and ecosystems as well as the water crisis particularly in recent decades oki and kanae 2006 cardinale et al 2012 ipcc 2014 grill et al 2019 poff 2019 for example river connectivity and biodiversity status have been extensively damaged in over 65 of global rivers vorosmarty et al 2010 grill et al 2019 and the water quality has severely deteriorated in most of china s rivers yu et al 2019 streamflow is influenced by a combination of multiple aspects including climate change land use cover change and human water use these aspects are driven by both natural and

et al 2000 wang et al 2015 due to the impacts of climate change and intensive human activities yang et al 2004a the yellow river basin has been facing severe water issues such as permafrost melting and ecosystem degradation in the source region yang et al 2004b zheng et al 2009 severe soil erosion in the middle region zhang et al 2008 and discontinuous flow in the downstream region yang et al 2004a zhang et al 2008 these issues have seriously damaged river ecosystem health and restricted the sustainable development of the yellow river basin in september 2019 the chinese government stressed adherence to the ecological protection and high quality development of the yellow river basin therefore it is important to assess long term streamflow variations and identify the driving mechanisms of climate change and human activities at the regional scale which will promote water resource management and optimal operation in the yellow river basin currently the existing approaches to assess the streamflow variations are classified into the newtonian and darwinian approaches from microscopic and macro perspectives respectively harman and troch 2014 hero et al 2018 omer et al 2020 potter and chiew 2011 wang and tang 2014 zhang et al 2018b the newtonian approach is physically based and most of the hydrological processes are derived from newton s laws of motion particularly for mass or energy conservation equations wang and tang 2014 most hydrological models e g swat topmodel vic are mainly categorized as newtonian approaches and are widely applied to explore the interaction of hydrological elements in numerous basins e g the murray darling basin the hai river basin the huai river basin the samin catchment potter and chiew 2011 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 hero et al 2018 however the applications in the yellow river basin show that hydrographs are still not well captured at daily scale particularly at the middle and downstream stations cong et al 2009 omer et al 2020 ye et al 2006 the poor simulation performance is because the impact mechanisms of human activities are variable and unclear such as the real regulation rules of numerous reservoirs ye et al 2006 and numerous data sources related to human activities are difficult to obtain such as water intake processes and irrigation schedules cong et al 2009 liu et al 2010 meanwhile a large number of necessary high resolution inputs further limit its application cong et al 2009 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 the darwinian approach usually interprets hydrological behaviors through systematic thinking and it is advantageous to simply and accurately explain how climate change and human activities determine the generation of streamflow magnitude the representative method is the budyko based method this method is derived from the budyko hypothesis and water balance theory and has been widely used in basins with high intensity of human activities gentine et al 2012 troch et al 2013 particularly in the yellow river basin zhang et al 2008 zheng et al 2009 zhao et al 2014 liang et al 2015 however the budyko based method mainly focuses on the streamflow magnitude at an annual scale zheng et al 2009 zhao et al 2014 liang et al 2015 and the budyko hypothesis and water balance theory are not suitable for interpreting the variations in the entire streamflow signatures e g average high and low flows because of the lack of direct analogous balance equations for these components the full streamflow signatures involve the streamflow attributes not only at the average state e g mean annual streamflow but also at high and low flow states donnelly et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a these signatures are important for comprehensively understanding streamflow behavior characteristics zhang et al 2018a interpreting and classifying catchments ssegane et al 2011 and managing water resources poff et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 streamflow signatures have attracted increasing attention and are widely used to predict streamflow shu and ouarda 2012 zhang et al 2018a explore hydrological ecological response mechanisms poff et al 1997 richter et al 2003 assess environmental flow poff et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 and determine hydrological responses of dam regulation zhang et al 2015 2017 accurate prediction of streamflow signatures is fundamental for water resource management donnelly et al 2016 and multiple log transformed linear regression mllr has been widely adopted to cope with this topic qamar et al 2016 shu and ouarda 2012 zhang et al 2018a along with the increasing attention on ecological restoration in the yellow river basin it is sensible and necessary to assess the impacts of climate change and human activities on the overall streamflow signatures rather than the traditional annual streamflow which is beneficial to explore the streamflow variations and the driving factors in a comprehensive manner in our study the budyko based method is improved to quantify the impacts of climate change and human activities on streamflow signatures rather than only mean annual streamflow the daily runoff observation series from 1960 to 2015 at four stations from the source region to the downstream region of the yellow river basin were selected for the assessment the specific objectives are 1 to fully characterize the streamflow by several signatures including average flow signatures low flow signatures and high flow signatures 2 to deduce a differential equation to separate the impacts of climate change and human activities on the entire streamflow signatures based on the budyko hypothesis and the quantitative relationships between streamflow signatures and climate variables 3 to separate the individual contributions of climate change and human activities on the variations in streamflow signatures and further deduce the possible causes and 4 to validate contribution results by comparing them with the distributed hydrological modeling method this study will reveal the separate responses of streamflow signatures to climate change and human activities and it will be beneficial for managing basin water resources and relieving the water crisis in the yellow river basin 2 study area and data sources 2 1 study area the yellow river basin 32 10 42 50 n 95 53 119 5 e is the second largest river basin in china with a total drainage area of 7 95 105 km2 fig 1 a the mainstream of the yellow river originates in the bayankala mountains of the qinghai tibet plateau and the total length is 5 464 km it runs through nine provinces and autonomous regions from western china to eastern china the annual sunshine time is sufficient ranging from 2000 to 3300 h and the annual mean temperature is approximately 4 14 c which gradually increases from west to east the annual mean precipitation is 450 mm and it is unevenly distributed throughout the year and the river basin the precipitation in the flood season from july to october accounts for approximately 65 of the total annual precipitation and the streamflow in the flood season accounts for over 60 of the total annual streamflow the main land use type is agricultural land which accounts for over 26 4 of the total drainage area numerous large agricultural irrigation projects are distributed in the yellow river basin including the ningxia and hetao irrigation areas in the upstream the fen wei irrigation area in the middle stream and the yellow river irrigation area in the downstream a substantial amount of water is taken from the yellow river for irrigation consumption fig 1 b according to the yellow river water resources bulletin in 2017 the water intake and consumption of annual irrigation were 28 35 billion m3 and 22 84 billion m3 which accounted for 70 9 and 69 4 of the total annual mean water intake and consumption respectively in addition many hydraulic projects e g reservoirs and sluices have been constructed with a total storage capacity of 90 0 billion m3 which accounts for 155 of the total annual mean streamflow magnitude representative projects are the sanmenxia liujiaxia and xiaolangdi reservoirs with total storage capacity of 9 6 billion m3 installed in 1961 5 7 billion m3 installed in 1969 and 12 65 billion m3 installed in 2000 respectively all of which play important roles in flood control agricultural irrigation and power generation therefore the streamflow in the whole basin is altered by irrigation projects and hydraulic projects in our study the yellow river basin is mainly divided into four regions based on the selected hydrological stations tangnaihai qingtongxia longmen and lijin the source region above tangnaihai the upstream region between tangnaihai and qingtongxia tang qing the middle stream region between qingtongxia and longmen qing long and the downstream region between longmen and lijin long li the reservoir capacities of the tang qing and long li regions account for 35 13 and 63 01 of the total reservoir capacities in the yellow river basin respectively fig 1 c tremendous agricultural irrigation areas also exist in the qing long and long li regions 2 2 data sources the long term daily runoff observations from 1960 to 2015 at four stations tangnaihai qingtongxia longmen and lijin were obtained from the hydrology bureau of the yellow river conservancy commission http www yrcc gov cn in addition the corresponding daily weather observations at 330 national meteorological stations were obtained from the china meteorological administration http data cma cn including precipitation mean minimum and maximum temperatures the daily precipitation and minimum and maximum temperatures were interpolated by the inverse distance weighting method zhang et al 2016a the land use data with spatial resolution of 1 km were collected from the resource and environmental science data center of the chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn nine distinct land use types were reclassified using arcgis 10 2 following the current land use classification standard of china gbt 21010 2007 china s national standard 2007 including glacier snowfield construction land dry land woodland water paddy field marshland grassland and desert 3 methods 3 1 streamflow signatures and climate metrics streamflow signatures have been widely used in eco hydrology and can provide a comprehensive summary of streamflow states shu and ouarda 2012 zhang et al 2018a in our study seven streamflow signatures were selected table 1 including three metrics describing the average flow conditions two metrics describing low flow conditions and two metrics describing high flow conditions both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are adopted to represent climate change as a widely used method to calculate the potential evapotranspiration the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1982 is adopted in our study because only the daily maximum and minimum temperatures are needed to investigate the relationships between streamflow variability and climate change 17 potential climate metrics were summarized to characterize magnitude duration and variability of climate zhang et al 2019 including ten precipitation metrics and seven potential evapotranspiration metrics table 2 the three most highly related climate metrics were analyzed for each streamflow signature based on stepwise regression all streamflow signatures and climate metrics calculated using long term daily series are at annual scale 3 2 impact assessment framework of climate change and human activities the budyko based method yang et al 2008 2014 liang et al 2015 is usually adopted to attribute the annual streamflow changes to climate change or human activities however this method is still not adopted to attribute the other streamflow signatures due to unclear relationships between these signatures and climate metrics precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in our study the relationships between streamflow signatures annual streamflow and climate metrics were investigated using natural streamflow series and multiple log transformed linear regression mllr then the new differential equation was derived to decompose streamflow signature changes due to changes in both streamflow and climate metrics the improved assessment framework fig 2 is established by integrating the budyko based method and the differential equation to quantify the impact of climate change and human activities on streamflow signatures the improved budyko based method is a statistical method and it should be noted that the impacts of climate change on streamflow signatures were directly deduced and all the other variations were considered as the impacts of human activities in this framework 3 2 1 streamflow signature estimation under natural conditions the whole study period is usually divided into the pre period with slight human activities i e natural condition and the post period with strong human activities for all the streamflow signature series by the non parametric pettitt test pettitt 1979 to maintain the consistency of the pre and post periods at the same station the abrupt years are obtained by averaging the abrupt years of the individual signature series different streamflow signatures exist statistical relationships which have been used in some studies such as the estimations of flow duration curves and flood events shu and ouarda 2012 xu et al 2017 in our study annual streamflow and climate metrics were selected as independent variables for regression modeling according to the existing studies shu and ouarda 2012 zhang et al 2018b and the mllr method zhang et al 2018a was used to fit streamflow signatures in the pre period as follows 1 ss b 0 q b q i 1 n c m i b i where b 0 bn are coefficients for the mllr q ss and cm are annual streamflow streamflow signatures and climate metrics respectively and n is set to the three most highly related climate metrics in this study equation 1 is transformed as 2 ln s s ln b 0 b q ln q i 1 n b i ln c m i because zero flow days usually occur at downstream stations in the mainstream of the yellow river equation 2 is invalid in this case i e ln ss to reasonably consider the zero flow for the low flow signatures the values of 3 year averages are used to establish equation 2 for low flow signatures 3 2 2 the budyko based method the budyko based method clearly reveals the nonlinear relationship between annual streamflow and its influencing factors e g precipitation potential evapotranspiration and basin characteristics the actual evapotranspiration e was estimated using the choudhury method choudhury 1999 which is based on the budyko hypothesis and has been widely used in the yellow river basin yang et al 2008 2014 liang et al 2015 the equation is given as 3 e p e 0 p 1 e 0 p n 1 n where n indicates the underlying surface features such as soil properties slope land use vegetation cover and climate seasonality yang et al 2008 2009 most existing studies in the non humid regions usually neglect the effects of climate seasonality on n for the assessment process yang et al 2009 2014 liang et al 2015 li et al 2016 wang et al 2018 hence our study assumes that the change in n value is mainly affected by land use change in the source region zheng et al 2009 wang et al 2018 and human activities e g afforestation and ecological restoration in the other regions of the yellow river basin liang et al 2015 a larger n value usually denotes a higher e and a lower q under the same climatic conditions p and e0 e0 p is the dryness index for the long term period the change in water storage is negligible and equal to zero hence the multi year water balance equation in the yellow river basin is as follows 4 q p e δ s p e 0 1 e 0 p n 1 n where n in the pre period is estimated by the q p and e0 observations in the pre period the differential form of equation 4 can be written as 5 δ q q p δ p q e 0 δ e 0 q n δ n if e 0 p is denoted as ϕ q p and q e 0 can be calculated as 6 q p 1 ϕ n 1 q e 0 q e 0 1 1 ϕ n 1 ϕ n 1 n 3 2 3 derivation and solution of the new differential equation according to eq 2 the new differential equation for the streamflow signature change can be deduced as 7 δ s s ss b q q δ q i 1 n b i c m i δ c m i according to equations 5 and 7 the effects of climate change on streamflow signature changes δ s s c are shown as 8 δ s s c b q ss q q p δ p q e 0 δ e 0 i 1 n b i ss c m i δ c m i where q p and q e 0 are calculated based on eq 6 assuming that the influences of human activities are independent of climate change the effects of human activities on streamflow signature changes δ s s h are as follows 9 δ s s h δ s s δ s s c therefore the contributions of climate change p c and human activities p h on the variations in ss can be calculated as 10 p c δ s s c δ s s c δ s s h p h δ s s h δ s s c δ s s h for pc and ph the positive values indicate that climate change or human activities result in the increase of streamflow signatures and the negative values indicate that climate change or human activities result in the decline of streamflow signatures 3 3 impact assessment using distributed hydrological modeling method the distributed hydrological modeling method was also adopted to validate the assessment results of the improved budyko based method however the complicated disturbance of human activities directly weakens the streamflow simulation performance from upstream to downstream model still remains difficult to adequately capture the streamflow in the middle and downstream regions at daily scale cong et al 2009 omer et al 2020 but for the source region dam regulation and water consumption are negligible and the major human impacts are grassland degradation and desertification induced by overgrazing huang et al 2016 li et al 2017 hence only the source region is selected for validation because of single and limited human activities zheng et al 2009 the integrated water system model heqm proposed by zhang et al 2016a is used for hydrological simulations under different scenarios of climate change and human activities heqm has been successfully applied to many catchments in china and exhibits good performance zhang et al 2015 2016b 2017 there are 49 sub basins partitioned according to the digital elevation model dem and geographical positions of hydrological stations using the arcgis 10 2 platform seven land use maps 1980 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 are used for model setup the daily precipitation minimum and maximum temperature observations were interpolated into each sub basin using the inverse distance weighting method detailed information on selected hydrological parameters is given in zhang et al 2016a and the assessment method of climate change and human activities contributions agrees with wang et al 2009 three indicators relative bias bias correlation coefficient r and nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency ns were selected to evaluate model performance zhang et al 2016a because three parameters g1 kr and ket are considerably impacted by human activities wang et al 2009 these parameters have to be re calibrated in the post period with strong human activities after all parameters are calibrated in the pre period with slight human activities hence the daily streamflow observation series at tangnaihai station during the pre period with slight human activities are divided into 1961 1975 and 1976 1989 for model calibration and validation respectively these three parameters g1 kr and ket are re calibrated in 1990 2004 and re validated in 2005 2015 during the post period two parameter groups pari and parii corresponding to the pre period and post period are obtained three scenarios data of pre period and pari first scenario data of pre period and parii second scenario and data of post period and parii third scenario are designed and adopted to drive the calibrated heqm to separate the impacts of climate change δssc and human activities δssh on streamflow signatures ss the equations are given as wang et al 2009 11 δ s s c s s 3 s s 2 δ s s h s s 2 s s 1 where ss1 ss2 and ss3 are signatures under the first second and third scenarios respectively then the individual contributions are calculated based on equation 10 4 results 4 1 inter annual variations in streamflow signatures according to the pettitt test the abrupt years of streamflow signatures range from 1985 to 1989 at tangnaihai station are confined to 1986 at qingtongxia station 1977 to 1994 at longmen station and 1985 at lijin station table 3 the means of the abrupt years at the four stations are in the 1980s that is 1989 1986 1987 and 1985 respectively the annual streamflow values at all stations show a rapid decrease after the 1980s despite a gradual revival after 2002 fig 3 the average values of annual streamflow in the post period are 82 68 70 97 64 49 and 29 95 of those in the pre period at four stations respectively the decrease strengthens gradually from the source to the downstream due to the gradual enhancement of human activities in particular the most serious decrease is at lijin station after 1985 mainly caused by excessive reservoir construction water intake and consumption liu et al 2010 and the drier climate is also an important influencing factor during 1986 2002 yang et al 2004a cong et al 2009 furthermore all streamflow signatures decrease most obviously at lijin station fig 3 with decreasing rates ranging from 49 52 amin to 72 59 mff table a1 for other stations the high flows in the post period show evidently decrease compared with the pre period especially at qingtongxia station with decreasing rates of 43 02 amax and 43 57 hig10 respectively the low flows at tangnaihai and qingtongxia stations have no obvious change but those at longmen station evidently decrease with decreasing rates of 20 02 amin and 27 77 low90 respectively the average non flood flows at tangnaihai qingtongxia and longmen stations show a slight decline but the average flood flows at the three stations exhibit significant decreases with decreasing rates of 21 67 47 54 and 50 28 respectively 4 2 estimation of streamflow signatures the annual streamflow has the largest correlations with all the streamflow signatures with coefficients ranging from 0 25 to 0 98 fig 4 some of the climate metrics such as annual climate characteristics p and e0 and seasonal climate characteristics pf pnf ebf and ef also have significant influence on streamflow signatures among all streamflow signatures high flow signatures and average flow signatures have more obvious relationships with annual streamflow and climate metrics with coefficients from 0 74 to 0 98 while low flow signatures are more difficult to estimate and their coefficients are slightly lower from 0 68 to 0 69 the multi correlation coefficients of mllr for streamflow signatures range from 0 86 low90 to 0 98 mff at tangnaihai station from 0 89 mnf and amax to 0 99 mff at qingtongxia station from 0 66 low90 to 0 99 mff and hig10 at longmen station and from 0 90 amin and 0 98 mff and hig10 at lijin station table 4 except for low90 0 66 and amax 0 74 at longmen station most signatures at all stations are well estimated by mllr with correlation coefficients greater than 0 80 specifically the average correlation coefficients at tangnaihai qingtongxia and lijin stations are larger than 0 90 the bias values of mllr are quite small only within 0 03 at all the stations therefore the streamflow signatures show clearly nonlinear relationships with the climate variables and the mllr equations show robust performance for the estimation of all streamflow signatures 4 3 contribution assessments of climate change and human activities for the budyko curves the values of parameter n in eq 3 for the four controlled catchments are 1 228 1 417 1 545 and 1 857 respectively and the values of the dryness index are from 1 5 to 2 5 fig 5 both the parameter n and the dryness index increase from the source region to the downstream region thus aridity increases and directly causes a gradual decrease in streamflow yield for most of streamflow signatures contributions of both climate change and human activities are negative fig 6 which denote both climate change and human activities decrease the streamflow signature values for the climate change the contributions are from 43 32 to 33 15 in the tangnaihai controlled catchment from 34 16 to 45 41 in the qingtongxia controlled catchment from 42 51 to 30 69 in the longmen controlled catchment and from 35 19 to 42 71 in the lijin controlled catchment the most affected signatures are amin in the tangnaihai qingtongxia and lijin controlled catchments with contributions of 43 42 45 41 and 42 71 respectively for the human activities the contributions are from 66 85 to 56 68 in the tangnaihai controlled catchment from 96 93 to 54 59 in the qingtongxia controlled catchment from 83 61 to 57 49 in the longmen controlled catchment and from 91 02 to 57 29 in the lijin controlled catchment the most affected signature is the average flow in the non flood season with contributions in four controlled catchments ranging from 59 10 to 92 04 followed by the annual maximum flow amin is impacted least in four controlled catchments with contributions ranging from 69 31 to 54 59 therefore human activities play major roles in the variations of streamflow signatures particularly in the lower reach it should be noted that for the tangnaihai controlled catchment the land use change is a critical impact factor wang et al 2018 and is integrated into human activities in this study 4 4 comparison with the hydrological modeling method the daily discharges are well reconstructed by heqm at tangnaihai station fig 7 and the detailed evaluation results are shown in table 5 the simulation exhibits good performances with bias values within 0 01 and the average r and ns being 0 92 and 0 76 respectively in both the calibration and validation periods during the pre period the performances in the post period are also acceptable with bias values within 0 03 and the average r and ns of 0 89 and 0 77 respectively thus heqm are reliable and could be applied to simulate hydrographs under different scenarios of climate change and human activities for the impacts of climate change both methods show the negative contributions for all streamflow signatures fig 8 the contributions are from 43 51 to 20 42 by heqm and from 43 32 to 33 15 by the improved budyko based method the contributions for 71 4 5 7 of streamflow signatures i e maf mff mnf amax and hig10 are well matched and the deviations are within 10 particularly for the high flow and average flow signatures however the contribution deviations for amin and low90 are slightly larger i e 22 9 for amin and 57 24 for low90 for the impacts of human activities both methods also show the negative contributions for most of the streamflow signatures except the low flow signatures i e mnf amin and low90 the contributions of 57 1 4 7 of streamflow signatures are also very close between these two approaches particularly for high flow and average flow signatures i e maf mff amax and hig10 however the results for low flow signatures exhibit great differences the contributions of human activities estimated by heqm are larger than 60 thus the simulations of heqm denote that the combined impacts of climate change and human activities will increase the low flow signatures mnf amin low90 however the decreasing observations of low flow signatures are opposite to that interpretation the main reason is that using the hydrological modeling method usually results in the poor simulation of low flow signatures zhang et al 2018a 5 discussion the budyko based method has been widely adopted to assess the impacts of climate change and human activities on annual streamflow yang et al 2008 2014 liang et al 2015 and most streamflow signature variations are described by the change magnitude using the iha rva type method yang et al 2012 ma et al 2014 however it remains difficult to deduce the impacts of climate change and human activities on the full streamflow signatures in this study we explore how to separate the effects of climate change and human activities on streamflow signatures and extend the traditional framework based on the relationships between streamflow signatures annual streamflow and climate metrics the improved framework extends the application of the budyko based method and explains the variation of streamflow signatures under different climatic conditions from the darwinian approach our derivation based on statistical relationships will be beneficial for exploring the overall streamflow signatures and further developing reasonable strategies to improve river eco hydrological conservation the streamflow response to climate change is nonlinearly related to the variations of precipitation potential evapotranspiration and basin characteristics and this nonlinear relationship is clear at the annual scale yang et al 2008 nevertheless human activities remarkably perturb the nonlinear relationship fernando and georgia 2015 for example the regulations of reservoirs and water intake have directly altered evapotranspiration and flow routing processes in the middle and lower streams of the yellow river basin cong et al 2009 zhao et al 2014 our results show that the contribution of human activities on annual streamflow variation is 61 55 in the tangnaihai controlled catchment which is similar with the impact reported in other studies zheng et al 2009 wang et al 2018 moreover we find that human activities have contributed more than 70 on annual streamflow in the qingtongxia longmen and lijin controlled catchments which is also consistent with the findings of other studies in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin or the loess plateau zhao et al 2014 liang et al 2015 li et al 2016 it is established that climate change causes reductions of most streamflow signatures with the mean absolute values of contributions ranging from 25 83 lijin controlled catchment to 37 60 tangnaihai controlled catchment the explanation is that the drier climate of the yellow river basin has existed since the 1980s with the significant increase in potential evapotranspiration and decrease in precipitation table a1 particularly the negative effects of climate change are greatest in the source region primarily because it has the greatest increasing rate of potential evapotranspiration 6 44 table a1 and more drastic impacts of human activities are present in the other regions yang et al 2012 liang et al 2015 in addition for the source region climate change would result in the land use change such as frozen ground degradation which could further strengthen the impacts of climate change on streamflow signatures wang et al 2018 therefore climate change plays the critical role in streamflow signature variations in this region a variety of human activities significantly alter streamflow signatures from upstream to downstream including grassland degradation and desertification in the source region zheng et al 2009 li et al 2017 excessive dam regulation in the middle and downstream ma et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 soil and water conservation in the loess plateau wang et al 2015 and tremendous water consumption for agricultural industrial and other demands in the whole region liu et al 2010 ren et al 2016 although all of these human activities decrease most of the streamflow signatures e g average flow and high flow their impacts show obvious spatial differences for example grassland degradation and desertification significantly damage the ecosystem function of soil water retention decrease transpiration loss and increase both surface runoff and infiltration li et al 2017 however water stored locally usually evaporates before it reaches the local channel and subsurface flow to the nearest stream is decreased huang et al 2016 dam regulation tremendously decreases the inter annual magnitude and the variability of streamflow signatures by means of decreasing the peak flow in the flood season for flood control and increasing the flow magnitude and variability in the non flood season for social water demand zhang et al 2015 2017 by 2001 the total reservoir storages in the tang qing qing long and long li regions were 31 02 km3 1 89 km3 and 56 04 km3 respectively fig 1 c the high flow magnitudes are mainly influenced by dam regulations in the whole basin and decrease obviously in the downstream hence the impacts of human activities can explain 96 93 and 65 84 of the decrease in amax and hig10 respectively in the qingtongxia controlled catchment compared to the impact of reservoir regulations massive soil and water conservation measures check dams terraces and afforestation for gfgp have a similar but smaller effect on the flow regime variations in the loess plateau i e south of the qing long region and most of the long li region liang et al 2015 zheng et al 2019 by the end of 2007 the area affected by soil and water conservation measures covered 225 600 km2 and the vegetated areas had increased by 119 500 km2 kong et al 2016 the soil and water conservation measures have significantly changed catchment characteristics and hydrological processes zheng et al 2019 the check dams and terraces greatly enhance rainfall infiltration and afforestation directly changes land cover evapotranspiration and the water storage capacity of the soil zhang et al 2008 zheng et al 2019 hence although the reservoir storage capacities in the qing long region are the smallest human activities still contribute 80 05 83 61 59 82 and 68 00 for the reductions in maf mff amax and hig10 in the longmen controlled catchment furthermore the long term consumptions of surface water and groundwater obviously decrease the low flow signatures in the non flood season and severely damage river ecosystem health in the middle and lower reaches yang et al 2012 rassam et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 according to the yellow river water resources bulletin 1998 2015 the water consumption amounts are rather high in the tang qing qing long and long li regions from 1998 to 2015 with the annual average surface water consumption of 6 73 billion m3 6 77 billion m3 and 15 63 billion m3 respectively and with the annual average groundwater consumption of 0 26 billion m3 2 49 billion m3 and 6 25 billion m3 respectively fig 9 hence the human activities explain 57 29 and 82 73 of the decrease in amin and low90 respectively in the lijin controlled catchment in contrast human activities contribute 69 31 for the reduction of amin in the longmen controlled catchment though its total water withdrawal is not the largest the main reason is that the reduction in groundwater storage is the greatest in the eastern qing long region in the loess plateau due to the massive coal mining exploitation in shanxi province gao et al 2015 xie et al 2018 in addition the results are also compared with those of the hydrological modeling method to validate the rationality of improved method for the tangnaihai controlled catchment the results from two methods indicate the same dominant factor human activities for the declines in average and high flow signatures however individual contributions on low flow signatures estimated by heqm are different from those from the budyko based method the main reason is poor simulation of low flow signatures from heqm zhang et al 2016b the observations of low flow at tangnaihai station show decreasing trends table a1 but simulations of low flow from heqm increase evidently the objective calibration of the hydrological model usually focuses on good simulations of high and average flow magnitudes zhang et al 2016b 2018a which results in poor reproduction of low flow signatures particularly the variation of annual streamflow induced by climate change from the budyko based method 38 45 is smaller than that from heqm 43 51 the explanation is that the impacts of inter annual and intra annual precipitation variability are considered in the hydrological modeling method sun et al 2014 in summary the improved budyko based method is robust for the impact assessment and is simpler than the hydrological modeling method because only daily observed data of precipitation temperature and streamflow are needed however the relationships between low flow signatures and climate metrics need to be further explored because low flow signatures are complicatedly impacted by climate conditions vegetation dynamic and ecosystem resilience donnelly et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a 6 conclusions this study proposes an improved framework to partition the impacts of climate change and human activities on the variation of streamflow signatures based on the budyko hypothesis and the derived differential equation and it assesses their individual contributions from 1960 to 2015 in the yellow river basin the distributed hydrological model heqm is used to further validate the reliability of the improved framework the results show that 1 the pre period and post period are detected for most streamflow signature series and the abrupt years are mainly in the 1980s all streamflow signatures in the post period at four stations have evidently declined particularly high flow magnitude compared with those in the pre period with decreasing rates ranging from 23 05 to 70 42 2 the annual streamflow is highly correlated with all the streamflow signatures with coefficients ranging from 0 25 to 0 98 some of the climate metrics such as annual climate characteristics annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and seasonal climate characteristics precipitation in flood and non flood evapotranspiration before flood and in flood also have significant influence on streamflow signatures the relationships between streamflow signatures annual streamflow and climate metrics are nonlinear and most of the correlation coefficients are larger than 0 80 by the mllr method 3 both climate change and human activities decrease most streamflow signatures and human activities play major roles in the variations of streamflow signatures for four controlled catchments the contributions of human activities are from 66 85 to 56 68 in the tangnaihai controlled catchment from 96 93 to 54 59 in the qingtongxia controlled catchment from 83 61 to 57 49 in the longmen controlled catchment and from 91 02 to 57 29 in the lijin controlled catchment the most affected signature is the average flow in non flood with contributions in four controlled catchments ranging from 59 10 to 92 04 the second most affected signature is the annual maximum flow with contributions ranging from 96 93 to 59 82 the amin is impacted least in four controlled catchments with contributions ranging from 69 31 to 54 59 our study proposes an improved budyko based method to attribute the variation of streamflow signatures to climate change and human activities based on the observed series of precipitation temperature and daily flow the study will promote the simplicity and flexibility of streamflow signature assessment and provide a scientific guide for river ecosystem health conversation and restoration however it is still difficult to separate the impacts of different types of human activities e g land use change afforestation reservoir regulation water intake and consumption due to the complicated interactions among these human activities the impact of climate seasonality on variations of the underlying surface features n should be further explored and the indirect impacts of climate change should also be specifically addressed in future studies the signature metrics could be further extended such as duration timing and frequency of streamflow and their causal relationships with climate metrics should also be investigated in future works credit authorship contribution statement wei wang data curation methodology software writing original draft yongyong zhang resources methodology writing review editing

5087,streamflow has been complexly altered by climate change and human activities in major rivers worldwide the traditional darwinian approach for impact assessment of climate change and human activities mainly focuses on variations in annual streamflow but ignores other critical streamflow characteristics e g high and low flow signatures in our study seven streamflow metrics were adopted to characterize the main streamflow signatures including average low and high flows and the budyko based method was extended based on the derived differential equation of streamflow signature change to separate individual impacts of climate change and human activities the yellow river basin china was selected as the study area because of its high intensity of human activities and daily runoff observation series from 1960 to 2015 at four stations from the source region to the downstream region were used for the assessment the assessment results were also compared with those estimated by the hydrological modeling method for validation the results show that all streamflow signatures at the four stations have evidently declined after the 1980s particularly for high flow magnitudes both climate change and human activities decrease most of streamflow signatures and human activities play major roles which are gradually enhanced from the source region to the downstream region the contributions of human activities are from 66 85 to 56 68 in the tangnaihai controlled catchment from 96 93 to 54 59 in the qingtongxia controlled catchment from 83 61 to 57 49 in the longmen controlled catchment and from 91 02 to 57 29 in the lijin controlled catchment the most impacted signature is the average flow in the non flood season followed by the annual maximum flow the estimated contributions of climate change and human activities match well with those estimated by the hydrological modeling method particularly for the high and average flow signatures with contribution deviations less than 10 however the estimated contributions to the low flow signatures are quite different likely due to large uncertainty of low flow estimation this study is expected to provide insights into the streamflow variations basin wide and provide scientific foundations for ecological protection and high quality development of the yellow river basin china keywords streamflow signatures climate change human activities budyko hypothesis attribution analysis yellow river basin 1 introduction streamflow of the global major rivers has been complexly altered resulting in the degradation of water quality and ecosystems as well as the water crisis particularly in recent decades oki and kanae 2006 cardinale et al 2012 ipcc 2014 grill et al 2019 poff 2019 for example river connectivity and biodiversity status have been extensively damaged in over 65 of global rivers vorosmarty et al 2010 grill et al 2019 and the water quality has severely deteriorated in most of china s rivers yu et al 2019 streamflow is influenced by a combination of multiple aspects including climate change land use cover change and human water use these aspects are driven by both natural and anthropogenic factors tang 2020 the major driving factors for streamflow variability have been widely attributed to climate change and human activities ipcc 2007 piao et al 2010 jaramillo and destouni 2015 sun et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 wu et al 2018 however great challenges remain in the water science community for interpreting regional streamflow variations and their driving mechanisms due to the complex combined interactions between climate change and human activities chang et al 2016 tang and oki 2016 hero et al 2018 as the second largest river basin in china the yellow river basin is characterized by its diverse and variable climatic conditions and intensive human alterations it covers three climate regions alpine temperate continental and temperate continental monsoon various human activities are present including reservoir and silt dam constructions cong et al 2009 excessive agricultural irrigation tang et al 2008 ren et al 2016 and the grain for green project gfgp zhang et al 2000 wang et al 2015 due to the impacts of climate change and intensive human activities yang et al 2004a the yellow river basin has been facing severe water issues such as permafrost melting and ecosystem degradation in the source region yang et al 2004b zheng et al 2009 severe soil erosion in the middle region zhang et al 2008 and discontinuous flow in the downstream region yang et al 2004a zhang et al 2008 these issues have seriously damaged river ecosystem health and restricted the sustainable development of the yellow river basin in september 2019 the chinese government stressed adherence to the ecological protection and high quality development of the yellow river basin therefore it is important to assess long term streamflow variations and identify the driving mechanisms of climate change and human activities at the regional scale which will promote water resource management and optimal operation in the yellow river basin currently the existing approaches to assess the streamflow variations are classified into the newtonian and darwinian approaches from microscopic and macro perspectives respectively harman and troch 2014 hero et al 2018 omer et al 2020 potter and chiew 2011 wang and tang 2014 zhang et al 2018b the newtonian approach is physically based and most of the hydrological processes are derived from newton s laws of motion particularly for mass or energy conservation equations wang and tang 2014 most hydrological models e g swat topmodel vic are mainly categorized as newtonian approaches and are widely applied to explore the interaction of hydrological elements in numerous basins e g the murray darling basin the hai river basin the huai river basin the samin catchment potter and chiew 2011 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 hero et al 2018 however the applications in the yellow river basin show that hydrographs are still not well captured at daily scale particularly at the middle and downstream stations cong et al 2009 omer et al 2020 ye et al 2006 the poor simulation performance is because the impact mechanisms of human activities are variable and unclear such as the real regulation rules of numerous reservoirs ye et al 2006 and numerous data sources related to human activities are difficult to obtain such as water intake processes and irrigation schedules cong et al 2009 liu et al 2010 meanwhile a large number of necessary high resolution inputs further limit its application cong et al 2009 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 the darwinian approach usually interprets hydrological behaviors through systematic thinking and it is advantageous to simply and accurately explain how climate change and human activities determine the generation of streamflow magnitude the representative method is the budyko based method this method is derived from the budyko hypothesis and water balance theory and has been widely used in basins with high intensity of human activities gentine et al 2012 troch et al 2013 particularly in the yellow river basin zhang et al 2008 zheng et al 2009 zhao et al 2014 liang et al 2015 however the budyko based method mainly focuses on the streamflow magnitude at an annual scale zheng et al 2009 zhao et al 2014 liang et al 2015 and the budyko hypothesis and water balance theory are not suitable for interpreting the variations in the entire streamflow signatures e g average high and low flows because of the lack of direct analogous balance equations for these components the full streamflow signatures involve the streamflow attributes not only at the average state e g mean annual streamflow but also at high and low flow states donnelly et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a these signatures are important for comprehensively understanding streamflow behavior characteristics zhang et al 2018a interpreting and classifying catchments ssegane et al 2011 and managing water resources poff et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 streamflow signatures have attracted increasing attention and are widely used to predict streamflow shu and ouarda 2012 zhang et al 2018a explore hydrological ecological response mechanisms poff et al 1997 richter et al 2003 assess environmental flow poff et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 and determine hydrological responses of dam regulation zhang et al 2015 2017 accurate prediction of streamflow signatures is fundamental for water resource management donnelly et al 2016 and multiple log transformed linear regression mllr has been widely adopted to cope with this topic qamar et al 2016 shu and ouarda 2012 zhang et al 2018a along with the increasing attention on ecological restoration in the yellow river basin it is sensible and necessary to assess the impacts of climate change and human activities on the overall streamflow signatures rather than the traditional annual streamflow which is beneficial to explore the streamflow variations and the driving factors in a comprehensive manner in our study the budyko based method is improved to quantify the impacts of climate change and human activities on streamflow signatures rather than only mean annual streamflow the daily runoff observation series from 1960 to 2015 at four stations from the source region to the downstream region of the yellow river basin were selected for the assessment the specific objectives are 1 to fully characterize the streamflow by several signatures including average flow signatures low flow signatures and high flow signatures 2 to deduce a differential equation to separate the impacts of climate change and human activities on the entire streamflow signatures based on the budyko hypothesis and the quantitative relationships between streamflow signatures and climate variables 3 to separate the individual contributions of climate change and human activities on the variations in streamflow signatures and further deduce the possible causes and 4 to validate contribution results by comparing them with the distributed hydrological modeling method this study will reveal the separate responses of streamflow signatures to climate change and human activities and it will be beneficial for managing basin water resources and relieving the water crisis in the yellow river basin 2 study area and data sources 2 1 study area the yellow river basin 32 10 42 50 n 95 53 119 5 e is the second largest river basin in china with a total drainage area of 7 95 105 km2 fig 1 a the mainstream of the yellow river originates in the bayankala mountains of the qinghai tibet plateau and the total length is 5 464 km it runs through nine provinces and autonomous regions from western china to eastern china the annual sunshine time is sufficient ranging from 2000 to 3300 h and the annual mean temperature is approximately 4 14 c which gradually increases from west to east the annual mean precipitation is 450 mm and it is unevenly distributed throughout the year and the river basin the precipitation in the flood season from july to october accounts for approximately 65 of the total annual precipitation and the streamflow in the flood season accounts for over 60 of the total annual streamflow the main land use type is agricultural land which accounts for over 26 4 of the total drainage area numerous large agricultural irrigation projects are distributed in the yellow river basin including the ningxia and hetao irrigation areas in the upstream the fen wei irrigation area in the middle stream and the yellow river irrigation area in the downstream a substantial amount of water is taken from the yellow river for irrigation consumption fig 1 b according to the yellow river water resources bulletin in 2017 the water intake and consumption of annual irrigation were 28 35 billion m3 and 22 84 billion m3 which accounted for 70 9 and 69 4 of the total annual mean water intake and consumption respectively in addition many hydraulic projects e g reservoirs and sluices have been constructed with a total storage capacity of 90 0 billion m3 which accounts for 155 of the total annual mean streamflow magnitude representative projects are the sanmenxia liujiaxia and xiaolangdi reservoirs with total storage capacity of 9 6 billion m3 installed in 1961 5 7 billion m3 installed in 1969 and 12 65 billion m3 installed in 2000 respectively all of which play important roles in flood control agricultural irrigation and power generation therefore the streamflow in the whole basin is altered by irrigation projects and hydraulic projects in our study the yellow river basin is mainly divided into four regions based on the selected hydrological stations tangnaihai qingtongxia longmen and lijin the source region above tangnaihai the upstream region between tangnaihai and qingtongxia tang qing the middle stream region between qingtongxia and longmen qing long and the downstream region between longmen and lijin long li the reservoir capacities of the tang qing and long li regions account for 35 13 and 63 01 of the total reservoir capacities in the yellow river basin respectively fig 1 c tremendous agricultural irrigation areas also exist in the qing long and long li regions 2 2 data sources the long term daily runoff observations from 1960 to 2015 at four stations tangnaihai qingtongxia longmen and lijin were obtained from the hydrology bureau of the yellow river conservancy commission http www yrcc gov cn in addition the corresponding daily weather observations at 330 national meteorological stations were obtained from the china meteorological administration http data cma cn including precipitation mean minimum and maximum temperatures the daily precipitation and minimum and maximum temperatures were interpolated by the inverse distance weighting method zhang et al 2016a the land use data with spatial resolution of 1 km were collected from the resource and environmental science data center of the chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn nine distinct land use types were reclassified using arcgis 10 2 following the current land use classification standard of china gbt 21010 2007 china s national standard 2007 including glacier snowfield construction land dry land woodland water paddy field marshland grassland and desert 3 methods 3 1 streamflow signatures and climate metrics streamflow signatures have been widely used in eco hydrology and can provide a comprehensive summary of streamflow states shu and ouarda 2012 zhang et al 2018a in our study seven streamflow signatures were selected table 1 including three metrics describing the average flow conditions two metrics describing low flow conditions and two metrics describing high flow conditions both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are adopted to represent climate change as a widely used method to calculate the potential evapotranspiration the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1982 is adopted in our study because only the daily maximum and minimum temperatures are needed to investigate the relationships between streamflow variability and climate change 17 potential climate metrics were summarized to characterize magnitude duration and variability of climate zhang et al 2019 including ten precipitation metrics and seven potential evapotranspiration metrics table 2 the three most highly related climate metrics were analyzed for each streamflow signature based on stepwise regression all streamflow signatures and climate metrics calculated using long term daily series are at annual scale 3 2 impact assessment framework of climate change and human activities the budyko based method yang et al 2008 2014 liang et al 2015 is usually adopted to attribute the annual streamflow changes to climate change or human activities however this method is still not adopted to attribute the other streamflow signatures due to unclear relationships between these signatures and climate metrics precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in our study the relationships between streamflow signatures annual streamflow and climate metrics were investigated using natural streamflow series and multiple log transformed linear regression mllr then the new differential equation was derived to decompose streamflow signature changes due to changes in both streamflow and climate metrics the improved assessment framework fig 2 is established by integrating the budyko based method and the differential equation to quantify the impact of climate change and human activities on streamflow signatures the improved budyko based method is a statistical method and it should be noted that the impacts of climate change on streamflow signatures were directly deduced and all the other variations were considered as the impacts of human activities in this framework 3 2 1 streamflow signature estimation under natural conditions the whole study period is usually divided into the pre period with slight human activities i e natural condition and the post period with strong human activities for all the streamflow signature series by the non parametric pettitt test pettitt 1979 to maintain the consistency of the pre and post periods at the same station the abrupt years are obtained by averaging the abrupt years of the individual signature series different streamflow signatures exist statistical relationships which have been used in some studies such as the estimations of flow duration curves and flood events shu and ouarda 2012 xu et al 2017 in our study annual streamflow and climate metrics were selected as independent variables for regression modeling according to the existing studies shu and ouarda 2012 zhang et al 2018b and the mllr method zhang et al 2018a was used to fit streamflow signatures in the pre period as follows 1 ss b 0 q b q i 1 n c m i b i where b 0 bn are coefficients for the mllr q ss and cm are annual streamflow streamflow signatures and climate metrics respectively and n is set to the three most highly related climate metrics in this study equation 1 is transformed as 2 ln s s ln b 0 b q ln q i 1 n b i ln c m i because zero flow days usually occur at downstream stations in the mainstream of the yellow river equation 2 is invalid in this case i e ln ss to reasonably consider the zero flow for the low flow signatures the values of 3 year averages are used to establish equation 2 for low flow signatures 3 2 2 the budyko based method the budyko based method clearly reveals the nonlinear relationship between annual streamflow and its influencing factors e g precipitation potential evapotranspiration and basin characteristics the actual evapotranspiration e was estimated using the choudhury method choudhury 1999 which is based on the budyko hypothesis and has been widely used in the yellow river basin yang et al 2008 2014 liang et al 2015 the equation is given as 3 e p e 0 p 1 e 0 p n 1 n where n indicates the underlying surface features such as soil properties slope land use vegetation cover and climate seasonality yang et al 2008 2009 most existing studies in the non humid regions usually neglect the effects of climate seasonality on n for the assessment process yang et al 2009 2014 liang et al 2015 li et al 2016 wang et al 2018 hence our study assumes that the change in n value is mainly affected by land use change in the source region zheng et al 2009 wang et al 2018 and human activities e g afforestation and ecological restoration in the other regions of the yellow river basin liang et al 2015 a larger n value usually denotes a higher e and a lower q under the same climatic conditions p and e0 e0 p is the dryness index for the long term period the change in water storage is negligible and equal to zero hence the multi year water balance equation in the yellow river basin is as follows 4 q p e δ s p e 0 1 e 0 p n 1 n where n in the pre period is estimated by the q p and e0 observations in the pre period the differential form of equation 4 can be written as 5 δ q q p δ p q e 0 δ e 0 q n δ n if e 0 p is denoted as ϕ q p and q e 0 can be calculated as 6 q p 1 ϕ n 1 q e 0 q e 0 1 1 ϕ n 1 ϕ n 1 n 3 2 3 derivation and solution of the new differential equation according to eq 2 the new differential equation for the streamflow signature change can be deduced as 7 δ s s ss b q q δ q i 1 n b i c m i δ c m i according to equations 5 and 7 the effects of climate change on streamflow signature changes δ s s c are shown as 8 δ s s c b q ss q q p δ p q e 0 δ e 0 i 1 n b i ss c m i δ c m i where q p and q e 0 are calculated based on eq 6 assuming that the influences of human activities are independent of climate change the effects of human activities on streamflow signature changes δ s s h are as follows 9 δ s s h δ s s δ s s c therefore the contributions of climate change p c and human activities p h on the variations in ss can be calculated as 10 p c δ s s c δ s s c δ s s h p h δ s s h δ s s c δ s s h for pc and ph the positive values indicate that climate change or human activities result in the increase of streamflow signatures and the negative values indicate that climate change or human activities result in the decline of streamflow signatures 3 3 impact assessment using distributed hydrological modeling method the distributed hydrological modeling method was also adopted to validate the assessment results of the improved budyko based method however the complicated disturbance of human activities directly weakens the streamflow simulation performance from upstream to downstream model still remains difficult to adequately capture the streamflow in the middle and downstream regions at daily scale cong et al 2009 omer et al 2020 but for the source region dam regulation and water consumption are negligible and the major human impacts are grassland degradation and desertification induced by overgrazing huang et al 2016 li et al 2017 hence only the source region is selected for validation because of single and limited human activities zheng et al 2009 the integrated water system model heqm proposed by zhang et al 2016a is used for hydrological simulations under different scenarios of climate change and human activities heqm has been successfully applied to many catchments in china and exhibits good performance zhang et al 2015 2016b 2017 there are 49 sub basins partitioned according to the digital elevation model dem and geographical positions of hydrological stations using the arcgis 10 2 platform seven land use maps 1980 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 are used for model setup the daily precipitation minimum and maximum temperature observations were interpolated into each sub basin using the inverse distance weighting method detailed information on selected hydrological parameters is given in zhang et al 2016a and the assessment method of climate change and human activities contributions agrees with wang et al 2009 three indicators relative bias bias correlation coefficient r and nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency ns were selected to evaluate model performance zhang et al 2016a because three parameters g1 kr and ket are considerably impacted by human activities wang et al 2009 these parameters have to be re calibrated in the post period with strong human activities after all parameters are calibrated in the pre period with slight human activities hence the daily streamflow observation series at tangnaihai station during the pre period with slight human activities are divided into 1961 1975 and 1976 1989 for model calibration and validation respectively these three parameters g1 kr and ket are re calibrated in 1990 2004 and re validated in 2005 2015 during the post period two parameter groups pari and parii corresponding to the pre period and post period are obtained three scenarios data of pre period and pari first scenario data of pre period and parii second scenario and data of post period and parii third scenario are designed and adopted to drive the calibrated heqm to separate the impacts of climate change δssc and human activities δssh on streamflow signatures ss the equations are given as wang et al 2009 11 δ s s c s s 3 s s 2 δ s s h s s 2 s s 1 where ss1 ss2 and ss3 are signatures under the first second and third scenarios respectively then the individual contributions are calculated based on equation 10 4 results 4 1 inter annual variations in streamflow signatures according to the pettitt test the abrupt years of streamflow signatures range from 1985 to 1989 at tangnaihai station are confined to 1986 at qingtongxia station 1977 to 1994 at longmen station and 1985 at lijin station table 3 the means of the abrupt years at the four stations are in the 1980s that is 1989 1986 1987 and 1985 respectively the annual streamflow values at all stations show a rapid decrease after the 1980s despite a gradual revival after 2002 fig 3 the average values of annual streamflow in the post period are 82 68 70 97 64 49 and 29 95 of those in the pre period at four stations respectively the decrease strengthens gradually from the source to the downstream due to the gradual enhancement of human activities in particular the most serious decrease is at lijin station after 1985 mainly caused by excessive reservoir construction water intake and consumption liu et al 2010 and the drier climate is also an important influencing factor during 1986 2002 yang et al 2004a cong et al 2009 furthermore all streamflow signatures decrease most obviously at lijin station fig 3 with decreasing rates ranging from 49 52 amin to 72 59 mff table a1 for other stations the high flows in the post period show evidently decrease compared with the pre period especially at qingtongxia station with decreasing rates of 43 02 amax and 43 57 hig10 respectively the low flows at tangnaihai and qingtongxia stations have no obvious change but those at longmen station evidently decrease with decreasing rates of 20 02 amin and 27 77 low90 respectively the average non flood flows at tangnaihai qingtongxia and longmen stations show a slight decline but the average flood flows at the three stations exhibit significant decreases with decreasing rates of 21 67 47 54 and 50 28 respectively 4 2 estimation of streamflow signatures the annual streamflow has the largest correlations with all the streamflow signatures with coefficients ranging from 0 25 to 0 98 fig 4 some of the climate metrics such as annual climate characteristics p and e0 and seasonal climate characteristics pf pnf ebf and ef also have significant influence on streamflow signatures among all streamflow signatures high flow signatures and average flow signatures have more obvious relationships with annual streamflow and climate metrics with coefficients from 0 74 to 0 98 while low flow signatures are more difficult to estimate and their coefficients are slightly lower from 0 68 to 0 69 the multi correlation coefficients of mllr for streamflow signatures range from 0 86 low90 to 0 98 mff at tangnaihai station from 0 89 mnf and amax to 0 99 mff at qingtongxia station from 0 66 low90 to 0 99 mff and hig10 at longmen station and from 0 90 amin and 0 98 mff and hig10 at lijin station table 4 except for low90 0 66 and amax 0 74 at longmen station most signatures at all stations are well estimated by mllr with correlation coefficients greater than 0 80 specifically the average correlation coefficients at tangnaihai qingtongxia and lijin stations are larger than 0 90 the bias values of mllr are quite small only within 0 03 at all the stations therefore the streamflow signatures show clearly nonlinear relationships with the climate variables and the mllr equations show robust performance for the estimation of all streamflow signatures 4 3 contribution assessments of climate change and human activities for the budyko curves the values of parameter n in eq 3 for the four controlled catchments are 1 228 1 417 1 545 and 1 857 respectively and the values of the dryness index are from 1 5 to 2 5 fig 5 both the parameter n and the dryness index increase from the source region to the downstream region thus aridity increases and directly causes a gradual decrease in streamflow yield for most of streamflow signatures contributions of both climate change and human activities are negative fig 6 which denote both climate change and human activities decrease the streamflow signature values for the climate change the contributions are from 43 32 to 33 15 in the tangnaihai controlled catchment from 34 16 to 45 41 in the qingtongxia controlled catchment from 42 51 to 30 69 in the longmen controlled catchment and from 35 19 to 42 71 in the lijin controlled catchment the most affected signatures are amin in the tangnaihai qingtongxia and lijin controlled catchments with contributions of 43 42 45 41 and 42 71 respectively for the human activities the contributions are from 66 85 to 56 68 in the tangnaihai controlled catchment from 96 93 to 54 59 in the qingtongxia controlled catchment from 83 61 to 57 49 in the longmen controlled catchment and from 91 02 to 57 29 in the lijin controlled catchment the most affected signature is the average flow in the non flood season with contributions in four controlled catchments ranging from 59 10 to 92 04 followed by the annual maximum flow amin is impacted least in four controlled catchments with contributions ranging from 69 31 to 54 59 therefore human activities play major roles in the variations of streamflow signatures particularly in the lower reach it should be noted that for the tangnaihai controlled catchment the land use change is a critical impact factor wang et al 2018 and is integrated into human activities in this study 4 4 comparison with the hydrological modeling method the daily discharges are well reconstructed by heqm at tangnaihai station fig 7 and the detailed evaluation results are shown in table 5 the simulation exhibits good performances with bias values within 0 01 and the average r and ns being 0 92 and 0 76 respectively in both the calibration and validation periods during the pre period the performances in the post period are also acceptable with bias values within 0 03 and the average r and ns of 0 89 and 0 77 respectively thus heqm are reliable and could be applied to simulate hydrographs under different scenarios of climate change and human activities for the impacts of climate change both methods show the negative contributions for all streamflow signatures fig 8 the contributions are from 43 51 to 20 42 by heqm and from 43 32 to 33 15 by the improved budyko based method the contributions for 71 4 5 7 of streamflow signatures i e maf mff mnf amax and hig10 are well matched and the deviations are within 10 particularly for the high flow and average flow signatures however the contribution deviations for amin and low90 are slightly larger i e 22 9 for amin and 57 24 for low90 for the impacts of human activities both methods also show the negative contributions for most of the streamflow signatures except the low flow signatures i e mnf amin and low90 the contributions of 57 1 4 7 of streamflow signatures are also very close between these two approaches particularly for high flow and average flow signatures i e maf mff amax and hig10 however the results for low flow signatures exhibit great differences the contributions of human activities estimated by heqm are larger than 60 thus the simulations of heqm denote that the combined impacts of climate change and human activities will increase the low flow signatures mnf amin low90 however the decreasing observations of low flow signatures are opposite to that interpretation the main reason is that using the hydrological modeling method usually results in the poor simulation of low flow signatures zhang et al 2018a 5 discussion the budyko based method has been widely adopted to assess the impacts of climate change and human activities on annual streamflow yang et al 2008 2014 liang et al 2015 and most streamflow signature variations are described by the change magnitude using the iha rva type method yang et al 2012 ma et al 2014 however it remains difficult to deduce the impacts of climate change and human activities on the full streamflow signatures in this study we explore how to separate the effects of climate change and human activities on streamflow signatures and extend the traditional framework based on the relationships between streamflow signatures annual streamflow and climate metrics the improved framework extends the application of the budyko based method and explains the variation of streamflow signatures under different climatic conditions from the darwinian approach our derivation based on statistical relationships will be beneficial for exploring the overall streamflow signatures and further developing reasonable strategies to improve river eco hydrological conservation the streamflow response to climate change is nonlinearly related to the variations of precipitation potential evapotranspiration and basin characteristics and this nonlinear relationship is clear at the annual scale yang et al 2008 nevertheless human activities remarkably perturb the nonlinear relationship fernando and georgia 2015 for example the regulations of reservoirs and water intake have directly altered evapotranspiration and flow routing processes in the middle and lower streams of the yellow river basin cong et al 2009 zhao et al 2014 our results show that the contribution of human activities on annual streamflow variation is 61 55 in the tangnaihai controlled catchment which is similar with the impact reported in other studies zheng et al 2009 wang et al 2018 moreover we find that human activities have contributed more than 70 on annual streamflow in the qingtongxia longmen and lijin controlled catchments which is also consistent with the findings of other studies in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin or the loess plateau zhao et al 2014 liang et al 2015 li et al 2016 it is established that climate change causes reductions of most streamflow signatures with the mean absolute values of contributions ranging from 25 83 lijin controlled catchment to 37 60 tangnaihai controlled catchment the explanation is that the drier climate of the yellow river basin has existed since the 1980s with the significant increase in potential evapotranspiration and decrease in precipitation table a1 particularly the negative effects of climate change are greatest in the source region primarily because it has the greatest increasing rate of potential evapotranspiration 6 44 table a1 and more drastic impacts of human activities are present in the other regions yang et al 2012 liang et al 2015 in addition for the source region climate change would result in the land use change such as frozen ground degradation which could further strengthen the impacts of climate change on streamflow signatures wang et al 2018 therefore climate change plays the critical role in streamflow signature variations in this region a variety of human activities significantly alter streamflow signatures from upstream to downstream including grassland degradation and desertification in the source region zheng et al 2009 li et al 2017 excessive dam regulation in the middle and downstream ma et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 soil and water conservation in the loess plateau wang et al 2015 and tremendous water consumption for agricultural industrial and other demands in the whole region liu et al 2010 ren et al 2016 although all of these human activities decrease most of the streamflow signatures e g average flow and high flow their impacts show obvious spatial differences for example grassland degradation and desertification significantly damage the ecosystem function of soil water retention decrease transpiration loss and increase both surface runoff and infiltration li et al 2017 however water stored locally usually evaporates before it reaches the local channel and subsurface flow to the nearest stream is decreased huang et al 2016 dam regulation tremendously decreases the inter annual magnitude and the variability of streamflow signatures by means of decreasing the peak flow in the flood season for flood control and increasing the flow magnitude and variability in the non flood season for social water demand zhang et al 2015 2017 by 2001 the total reservoir storages in the tang qing qing long and long li regions were 31 02 km3 1 89 km3 and 56 04 km3 respectively fig 1 c the high flow magnitudes are mainly influenced by dam regulations in the whole basin and decrease obviously in the downstream hence the impacts of human activities can explain 96 93 and 65 84 of the decrease in amax and hig10 respectively in the qingtongxia controlled catchment compared to the impact of reservoir regulations massive soil and water conservation measures check dams terraces and afforestation for gfgp have a similar but smaller effect on the flow regime variations in the loess plateau i e south of the qing long region and most of the long li region liang et al 2015 zheng et al 2019 by the end of 2007 the area affected by soil and water conservation measures covered 225 600 km2 and the vegetated areas had increased by 119 500 km2 kong et al 2016 the soil and water conservation measures have significantly changed catchment characteristics and hydrological processes zheng et al 2019 the check dams and terraces greatly enhance rainfall infiltration and afforestation directly changes land cover evapotranspiration and the water storage capacity of the soil zhang et al 2008 zheng et al 2019 hence although the reservoir storage capacities in the qing long region are the smallest human activities still contribute 80 05 83 61 59 82 and 68 00 for the reductions in maf mff amax and hig10 in the longmen controlled catchment furthermore the long term consumptions of surface water and groundwater obviously decrease the low flow signatures in the non flood season and severely damage river ecosystem health in the middle and lower reaches yang et al 2012 rassam et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 according to the yellow river water resources bulletin 1998 2015 the water consumption amounts are rather high in the tang qing qing long and long li regions from 1998 to 2015 with the annual average surface water consumption of 6 73 billion m3 6 77 billion m3 and 15 63 billion m3 respectively and with the annual average groundwater consumption of 0 26 billion m3 2 49 billion m3 and 6 25 billion m3 respectively fig 9 hence the human activities explain 57 29 and 82 73 of the decrease in amin and low90 respectively in the lijin controlled catchment in contrast human activities contribute 69 31 for the reduction of amin in the longmen controlled catchment though its total water withdrawal is not the largest the main reason is that the reduction in groundwater storage is the greatest in the eastern qing long region in the loess plateau due to the massive coal mining exploitation in shanxi province gao et al 2015 xie et al 2018 in addition the results are also compared with those of the hydrological modeling method to validate the rationality of improved method for the tangnaihai controlled catchment the results from two methods indicate the same dominant factor human activities for the declines in average and high flow signatures however individual contributions on low flow signatures estimated by heqm are different from those from the budyko based method the main reason is poor simulation of low flow signatures from heqm zhang et al 2016b the observations of low flow at tangnaihai station show decreasing trends table a1 but simulations of low flow from heqm increase evidently the objective calibration of the hydrological model usually focuses on good simulations of high and average flow magnitudes zhang et al 2016b 2018a which results in poor reproduction of low flow signatures particularly the variation of annual streamflow induced by climate change from the budyko based method 38 45 is smaller than that from heqm 43 51 the explanation is that the impacts of inter annual and intra annual precipitation variability are considered in the hydrological modeling method sun et al 2014 in summary the improved budyko based method is robust for the impact assessment and is simpler than the hydrological modeling method because only daily observed data of precipitation temperature and streamflow are needed however the relationships between low flow signatures and climate metrics need to be further explored because low flow signatures are complicatedly impacted by climate conditions vegetation dynamic and ecosystem resilience donnelly et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a 6 conclusions this study proposes an improved framework to partition the impacts of climate change and human activities on the variation of streamflow signatures based on the budyko hypothesis and the derived differential equation and it assesses their individual contributions from 1960 to 2015 in the yellow river basin the distributed hydrological model heqm is used to further validate the reliability of the improved framework the results show that 1 the pre period and post period are detected for most streamflow signature series and the abrupt years are mainly in the 1980s all streamflow signatures in the post period at four stations have evidently declined particularly high flow magnitude compared with those in the pre period with decreasing rates ranging from 23 05 to 70 42 2 the annual streamflow is highly correlated with all the streamflow signatures with coefficients ranging from 0 25 to 0 98 some of the climate metrics such as annual climate characteristics annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and seasonal climate characteristics precipitation in flood and non flood evapotranspiration before flood and in flood also have significant influence on streamflow signatures the relationships between streamflow signatures annual streamflow and climate metrics are nonlinear and most of the correlation coefficients are larger than 0 80 by the mllr method 3 both climate change and human activities decrease most streamflow signatures and human activities play major roles in the variations of streamflow signatures for four controlled catchments the contributions of human activities are from 66 85 to 56 68 in the tangnaihai controlled catchment from 96 93 to 54 59 in the qingtongxia controlled catchment from 83 61 to 57 49 in the longmen controlled catchment and from 91 02 to 57 29 in the lijin controlled catchment the most affected signature is the average flow in non flood with contributions in four controlled catchments ranging from 59 10 to 92 04 the second most affected signature is the annual maximum flow with contributions ranging from 96 93 to 59 82 the amin is impacted least in four controlled catchments with contributions ranging from 69 31 to 54 59 our study proposes an improved budyko based method to attribute the variation of streamflow signatures to climate change and human activities based on the observed series of precipitation temperature and daily flow the study will promote the simplicity and flexibility of streamflow signature assessment and provide a scientific guide for river ecosystem health conversation and restoration however it is still difficult to separate the impacts of different types of human activities e g land use change afforestation reservoir regulation water intake and consumption due to the complicated interactions among these human activities the impact of climate seasonality on variations of the underlying surface features n should be further explored and the indirect impacts of climate change should also be specifically addressed in future studies the signature metrics could be further extended such as duration timing and frequency of streamflow and their causal relationships with climate metrics should also be investigated in future works credit authorship contribution statement wei wang data curation methodology software writing original draft yongyong zhang resources methodology writing review editing

5088,model realism is of vital importance in science of hydrology in terms of realistic representation of hydrological processes and reliability of future prediction here we employed a stepwise modeling approach that leverages flexible model structures and multi source observations for robust streamflow simulation and internal variables validation with improved model realism this framework is demonstrated in yigong zangbu river yzr basin a data scarce glacier basin in the upper brahmaputra river we designed six experiments exp1 6 to use modeling as a tool to understand hydrological processes in this remote cold basin with extremely high altitude in exp1 we started with a distributed rainfall runoff model flexd representing the case that snow and glacier processes were ignored then we stepwisely added snow and glacier processes into flexd denoted as flexd s exp2 and flexd sg exp3 respectively and such improvement of model structure led to significantly improved streamflow estimates to explore the impact of different precipitation forcing on model performance flexd sg was driven by theissen average exp3 and three individual stations precipitation exp4 6 the model realism was tested by observed hydrograph snow cover area sca and glacier mass balance gmb results showed that a robust and realistic hydrological modeling system was achieved in exp6 in this modeling study we learned that 1 stepwise modeling is effective in investigating catchment behavior and snow and glacier melting are the dominant hydrological processes in the yzr basin 2 internal variables validation is beneficial to test model realism in data scarce basin 3 the flexd sg model calibrated by only one year hydrograph is sufficient to reproduce snow and glacier variations 4 precipitation of a single station as forcing data could outperform theissen average 5 based on the well tested model configuration in exp6 we analyzed simulated results and reconstructed the long term hydrography 1961 2013 to support the potential competence for decision making on water resources management in practice the proposed framework may significantly improve our skills in hydrological modeling over data poor regions keywords glacier hydrology hydrological model remote sensing model realism upper brahmaputra river data scarce basin 1 introduction model realism i e getting the right answers for the right reasons kirchner 2006 beven 2018 is the long pursuit of hydrological scientists and modelers which is strongly related to our processes understanding and predictive power although model test schemes normally comprise split sample tests differential split sample tests and proxy site tests seibert et al 2000 refsgaard et al 2014 gao et al 2016 all these tests use discharge as the sole validation target this is firstly because streamflow is the most valuable water resource and the culprit for many water related hazards which are critical in hydrology and water resources studies additionally streamflow is an integrated representation of catchment hydrological processes and generally has relatively higher measurement accuracy than other hydrological components guse et al 2016 however streamflow averagely only accounts for 40 of global terrestrial precipitation oki and kanae 2006 seneviratne et al 2010 which is further reduced in arid regions wang and hejazi 2011 donohue et al 2012 as a result modeled parameters are likely overfitted to compensate the streamflow modeling errors thereby leading substantial uncertainty in hydrological predictions previous studies revealed that intrinsic uncertainties in the input data model structure and parameters are key factors undermining hydrological model realism immzerzial 2015 winter et al 2015 hattermann et al 2018 although it is widely accepted that we should consider model structure uncertainty and develop tailor made models for different catchments to represent their specific hydrological processes in diverse climatic geologic and hydrologic conditions the dominant practice in hydrological modeling is still one size fits all model structure rather than fit for purpose clark et al 2008 2015 fenicia et al 2011 this is firstly because tailor made hydrological models need strong expertise on modeling and with time and labor intensity moreover model structure and parameter uncertainties are highly relevant and intertwined which makes it difficult to understand the model structure uncertainty stepwise modeling approach in the umbrella of flexible model framework allows us to distinguish the impact of model structure uncertainty on model performance fenicia et al 2008 2011 increasing number of studies found that model structure is important in hydrological modeling savenije 2010 fenicia et al 2011 clark et al 2015 few modelling frameworks were developed to allow flexible model setup to systematically understand model structure uncertainty such as fuse framework for understanding structural errors clark et al 2008 superflex fenicia et al 2011 flex topo savenije 2010 gao et al 2014 gharari et al 2014 nijzink et al 2016 and summa structure for unifying multiple modeling alternatives clark et al 2015 flexible model structure and stepwise modeling allow us to gradually improve models as presentation of hydrological processes model development becomes a learning process fenicia et al 2008 rather than a prior determined model structure as a ready to use tool by adjusting parameters in different case studies clark et al 2008 fenicia et al 2011 internal variables validation with complementary data except for input forcing data e g precipitation and temperature and runoff are beneficial for the realism test with the development of advanced measurements by different platforms most hydrology components can be directly measured or derived by measurements at multi scales for instance the land surface fluxes observation includes lysimeter singh et al 2018 sap flow poyatos et al 2016 and eddy covariance baldocchi 2014 the tracer experiments including biogeochemistry birkel et al 2014 hrachowitz et al 2016 isotope evaristo and mcdonnell 2017 benettin et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 and dna dahlke et al 2015 provide essential information about the origin sources storage and mixing of subsurface water berghuijs and kirchner 2017 remote sensing data provides unprecedented spatial distribution information of almost all water balance components including but not limited to precipitation huffman et al 2007 tang et al 2018 duan et al 2019 water level frappart et al 2005 huang et al 2018b surface soil moisture entekhabi et al 2014 dong and crow 2019 evaporation anderson et al 2011 li et al 2019 and groundwater variation famiglietti et al 2015 long et al 2017 however many hydrological variable observations are also still with large uncertainties sun et al 2018a 2018b duan et al 2018 li et al 2019 and even more so for fluxes in subsurface flow pathways neuweiler and helmig 2017 pfister and kirchner 2017 in cold regions comparing with other counterparts the snow and glacier variation as dominant hydrological processes can be measured in a relatively accurate way huang et al 2016 chen et al 2017 kaab et al 2015 brun et al 2017 simply because most of these processes take place on land surface and with easily distinguishable spectral and stereo characteristics in cold regions satellite images provide powerful information for snow cover area duethmann et al 2014 ke et al 2016 huang et al 2017 chen et al 2018 snow depth tedesco et al 2010 che et al 2014 wang et al 2019 glacier area liu et al 2015 and glacier mass balance gardelle et al 2012 brun et al 2017 this provides us with a unique opportunity to test model realism by clear observable internal variables in model which have significant impact on catchment hydrology the brahmaputra river originated from the northern slope of the himalayas in china known as yalung zangbu river in chinese language together with ganges and meghna river basins the ganges brahmaputra meghna as one of the largest rivers in the world feeds 630 million people as an international river it affects irrigation fishery hydropower water supply and ecosystem conservation in china india bhutan and bangladesh despite the great significances for its riparian residents ecosystem and economy our hydrological knowledge at this region is still very scarce firstly because the extremely harsh restrictive environment and difficult accessibility have results in scarce measurements of meteorological and hydrological variables in this region huang et al 2018a 2018b moreover as an international river with large sensitive impact most of the limited gauged measurements can be even confidential and thus data sharing is also a big issue which further constrains conducting researches in this region huang et al 2020 hydrological model and remote sensing data provide powerful tools to quantify hydrological processes a few modeling studies have been conducted to understand hydrological processes in this region and surrounding areas mishra 2015 immerzeel et al 2014 chen et al 2017 huss and hock 2018 pritchard 2019 but most of those studies focused on global or continental scales with arbitrary prior parameters due to the lack of in situ observation leaving large uncertainty and big room for improvement satellite remote sensing has been used to derive various hydrological components or related variables in this region for example precipitation tang et al 2018 wang et al 2020 evaporation li et al 2019 snow cover area huang et al 2017 snow depth wang et al 2019 and glacier mass balance brun et al 2017 but with nonnegligible uncertainty due to the complex terrain and lack of ground calibration wang et al 2019 li et al 2019 precipitation as one of the most important hydrological components is closely relevant to almost all hydrological components in catchment hydrology but precipitation has particularly spatial heterogeneity in mountainous basins strongly influenced by complex terrain thus precise precipitation data is essential for model realism interestingly immerzeel et al 2015 found that glacier mass balances and runoff data could be used to inversely infer precipitation in another words model validation by internal variables e g gmb allows us to validate our water balance estimations even reversely verifying or questioning the input forcing data itself e g precipitation to address the challenge of model realism in a glacier basin in the upper brahmaputra river with data scarcity in this study 1 we stepwisely included snow and glacier modules in a distributed catchment rainfall runoff model to understand their importance on the hydrograph simulation 2 we tested whether the short term hydrograph data is sufficient to constrain model parameters and achieve realistic simulation 3 we tested the applicability of widely used theissen method in mountainous basins by comparing its model performance with three individual meteorology stations 4 model realism was tested not only by hydrograph but also by internal variables including snow cover area and glacier mass balance 5 based on the well tested model configuration we analyzed hydrograph components from glacier non glacier area and different elevation bands and reconstructed the long term runoff 1961 2013 to improve the potential competence to support decision making on water resources management in practice 2 study area and data 2 1 study sites the yigong zangbu river yzr basin one of the headwaters of brahmaputra river is located at the eastern tibetan plateau originates from the south eastern part of nyainqêntanglha mountain range 30 05 31 03 n 92 52 95 19 e the yzr basin covers a total area of about 13 406 km2 with an elevation ranges from 2134 to 6920 m fig 1 the rich precipitation from monsoon interact with the steep valley which contributes to the marine glacier landscape in the yzr basin glaciers cover 3258 km2 area 24 3 of the basin area the yzr basin is located at the junction of westerly indian ocean monsoon and southeastern monsoon the annual average precipitation from 1961 to 2013 was 835 mm a 676 mm a and 760 mm a at three meteorology stations bomi linzhi jiali precipitation during summer june july and august accounts for 70 annual mean air temperature is about 8 8 c 8 9 c and 0 33 c at bomi linzhi and jiali stations the annual average discharge from 1967 to 1969 was 810 mm a in terms of runoff depth which is even larger than annual precipitation implying the limited amount of evaporation and the important contribution from glacier melting 2 2 data and processing 2 2 1 topography and hydrological landscape analysis the shuttle radar topography mission srtm 90 m resolution digital elevation model dem map was obtained from united states geological survey usgs https earthexplorer usgs gov the glacier covered area was obtained from the second glacier inventory in china liu et al 2015 we firstly classified the entire yzr basin into two landscapes i e glacier and non glacier each landscape is further divided into 96 elevation bands with 50 m interval we did this fine resolution classifying most because of allowing more flexibility to simulate gmb and even the equilibrium line altitude gao et al 2017a furthermore to account for the influence of aspect on snow and glacier melting north 315 45 south 135 225 as well as east west 45 135 and 225 315 facing aspects were identified total 576 units were classified fig 2 the topography analysis of the adjacent parlung zangbu river pzr glacier no 94 was also conducted and presented in fig 2 2 2 2 meteorological and hydrological data we collected daily precipitation and air temperature data 1961 2013 from three meteorological stations at bomi linzhi and jiali with altitudes of 2736 m 2992 m and 4489 m respectively the annually averaged temperature and annual total precipitation are presented in fig 3 meteorological data was obtained from china meteorological administration cma with strict standard for data quality control remote sensing precipitation was not considered in this study because of it was not available in model calibration and validation period 1967 1969 and with large uncertainty in this region wang et al 2020 the runoff gauge station is located near the end of the yzb fig 1 due to the sensitivity of international river dataset daily runoff during 1967 1969 was the only hydrological data we accessed to evaluate the input forcing data we compared temperature and precipitation from three meteorological stations fig 4 it was found that temperature among three stations has excellent correlations r2 0 90 and 0 89 which indicates the strong spatial correlations of temperature and their reliable data quality monthly lapse rate was used to interpolate temperature to each elevations band the lapse rates from january to december are 0 910 0 948 0 895 0 842 0 788 0 704 0 626 0 618 0 660 0 748 0 819 and 0 827 c 100 m li et al 2013 but the correlations of three precipitation data are very weak with r2 as 0 06 and 0 07 fig 5 which indicates strong precipitation spatial heterogeneity in this region to obtain the average precipitation we employed the common used theissen polygon analysis in which jiali accounts for 55 bomi 37 and linzhi 8 of the average precipitation 2 2 3 snow cover area sca we validated our hydrological models using daily snow cover area sca data from 2000 to 2012 at the spatial resolution of 500 m huang et al 2016 the sca product was derived by combining mod10a1 and myd10a1 binary snow cover products of the modis terra and modis aqua daily v005 version huang et al 2016 since the snow cover products can only identify snow depth larger than 3 cm given the snow density of approximately 0 18 kg l on tibetan plateau thus the snow water equivalent swe 5 4 mm in hydrological model is not regarded as snow cover while performing comparison the remotely sensed snow depth was not included in model validation due to its coarse resolution and large uncertainty in this region huang et al 2016 chen et al 2017 2 2 4 glacier mass balance gmb data there was no field glacier monitoring within the yzr basin satellite observed annual average gmb was 0 6 80 23 m w e a 1 from 2000 to 2016 which was converted by the change of elevation derived from satellite stereo imagery and the change of glacier area from optical satellite brun et al 2017 additionally the field gmb monitor from 1975 to 2013 in adjacent parlung zangbu river pzr glacier no 94 yang et al 2010a 2010b yao et al 2010 liu 2020 was involved as another important internal variable to test model transferability and realism figs 1 2 8 3 methodology 3 1 model description topography and landscape analysis provided the distributed framework to interpolate meteorology forcing data and hydrological processes in the umbrella of superflex fenicia et al 2011 we firstly extended the lumped rainfall runoff flex model gao et al 2016 to distributed flexd based on topography and landscape classification subsequently we stepwisely involved snow and glacier modules developed flexd s and flexd sg models to test their model performance on hydrography and validate their internal fluxes 3 1 1 rainfall runoff module in flexd model only rainfall runoff process was involved without considering snow and glacier processes rainfall directly enters the unsaturated reservoir s u characterized by 1 d s u d t p e a r u where e a is the evaporation which was estimated on the basis of potential evaporation estimated by hamon equation driven by air temperature hamon 1961 and relative soil moisture s u over root zone storage capacity s umax with an evaporation threshold parameter c e r u mm day is the runoff generation from unsaturated reservoir s u gao et al 2014 r u is split by a parameter d and recharges two separate linear reservoirs s f and s s which respectively represents the process of subsurface storm flow q f mm day and groundwater flow q s mm day where r f mm day is the recharge entering the fast response reservoir and r s mm day is the recharge entering the slow response reservoir k f day is the recession parameter of the fast response reservoir and k s day is the recession parameter of the slow response reservoir the detailed model structure is shown in fig 5 and the description of parameters are illustrated in table 1 and detailed equations can refer to gao et al 2017a 2017b 3 1 2 snowfall and snowmelt module whether the precipitation is snowfall p s or rainfall depends on various factors ding et al 2014 interestingly han et al 2010 analyzed large sample meteorological data in china and found that a single threshold temperature has sufficient accuracy to split snowfall and rainfall the single threshold temperature method determines precipitation phase by whether the daily average air temperature t is above or below a threshold temperature t t 2 p s p t t t 0 t t t for snowmelt simulation there are two types of models i e energy balance model and temperature index model hock 2005 due to data limitations in our study and the well reported robustness at daily scale gao et al 2012 2016 2017a 2017b 2018 the parsimonious temperature index model was employed in this study since snow cover on tibetan plateau is quite thin to avoid parameters equifinality and model uncertainty we did not consider the snow pack as porous media neither its water capacity nor water refreezing in snow cover the degree day factor f dd is another vital parameter in snowmelting on the basis of the degree day factor snowmelt m s can be calculated by the positive temperature according to numerous field based measurements in china zhang et al 2006 the prior range of f dd was set as 0 5 10 mm c day 81 because the detailed energy balance observations are lacking a conceptual multiplier c a set as 1 2 was introduced to quantify the influence of aspect on snow and ice melt the f dd in south facing aspect was multiplied by c a while the north facing aspects was multiplied by 1 c a and the east west facing aspects are kept as f dd modeled sca is the accumulated area of elevation bands with swe larger than 5 4 mm 3 d s w d t p s m s 4 m s f dd t c a t 0 0 t 0 snow sublimation e ag was estimated by

robust temperature index model positive temperature is firstly provided to melt snow if snow cover on ice exists if snow cover is free the ice melts and generates glacier runoff m g mm day it should be noticed that because of the lower albedo of the ice the degree day factor for glacier is larger than the snow degree day factor in the same region similarly we set its prior range according to

generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method beven and freer 2001 was used to conduct parameters uncertainty analysis and automatic parameter calibration in this study as a classic approach to quantify parameter uncertainty beven and binley 2014 monte carlo experiments provide parameter sampling to analyze the sensitivity of models to their parameters the runoff data in 1967 were used as calibration and runoff data in 1968 and 1969 were used as split sample validation the prior range of parameter sets of three models flexd flexd s flexd sg are shown in table 1 a monte carlo sampling strategy with 20 000 realizations from uniform prior parameter distributions was chosen to obtain posterior distributions of the free model parameters we selected 1 of the prior

streamflow simulation and the impact of different precipitation inputs exp3 6 on model performance in streamflow gmb and sca simulations exp1 the rainfall runoff flexd model was driven by distributed temperature data from jiali station with monthly temperature lapse rate and theissen polygon average precipitation flexd was calibrated based on precipitation streamflow data in 1967 the data in 1968 and 1969 were used as validation data exp2 we involved the snow module including snowfall and snowmelt into flexd to develop the flexd s model flexd s was driven by the same forcing data as flexd calibration and validation data were same as exp1 exp3 exp6 glacier melt was further considered and developed flexd sg in exp3 forcing data and calibration data were kept the same as exp1 and exp2 based on jiali temperature and theissen average precipitation in exp4 exp5 and exp6 we changed the forcing data temperature and precipitation to bomi linzhi and jiali to test the impact of different forcing data mainly precipitation on model performance model structure calibration validation and internal variables model test were all kept the same as exp3 for model validation besides observed runoff we further used the multi sources sca and gmb observations to validate internal fluxes 4 results and discussion 4 1 the importance of model structure fig 6 and table 3 show the performance of each model flexd flexd s flexd sg in both calibration and split sample validation in exp1 exp2 and exp3 with the same forcing data in exp1 the simulation failed to capture the observed streamflow time series in calibration i kge was 0 48 and in validation i kge i nse r2 i rmse were 0 38 0 14 0 61 and 2 27 mm d respectively in exp2 snow module was included which moderately improved the model performance with i kge of 0 56 in calibration and values of i kge i nse r2 i rmse as 0 49 0 46 0 80 1 79 mm d in validation in exp3 after considering the glacier processes flexd sg model had dramatic improvements with i kge of 0 94 in calibration and values of i kge i nse r2 i rmse as 0 86 0 92 0 97 0 71 mm d in validation respectively by comparison from exp1 to exp3 after considering snow and glacier modules model performance on hydrography simulation demonstrated stepwisely improvements in exp1 and exp2 flexd and flexd s cannot mimic hydrography well even the parameters are overfitted indicating model structure realism dominates the model performance in this study which cannot be compensated by parameter calibration 4 2 theissen average and individual station precipitation figs 3 and 4 show that air temperatures are closely correlated in three stations at both daily and annual scales the r2 of jiali and bomi daily temperature is 0 90 and 0 89 for jiali and linzhi the strong correlated temperature among three stations indicates that temperature has regular spatial pattern and it is reliable to use temperature lapse rate to interpolate distributed temperature however the daily precipitation r2 of jiali and bomi was merely 0 06 and 0 07 for jiali and linzhi the different annual precipitation variation of three stations also indicates the strong spatial heterogeneous precipitation this weak correlation among different stations does not allow us to interpolate precipitation by simple lapse rate method thus from exp3 to exp6 we used theissen average precipitation and three individual station precipitation bomi linzhi jiali as input to force the flexd sg model from exp3 to exp4 precipitation input changed from theissen average to bomi station and temperature input changed from jiali to bomi the ikge in calibration reduced from 0 94 to 0 81 and in validation ikge inse r2 were reduced from 0 86 0 92 0 97 to 0 78 0 80 0 93 respectively while irmse was increased from 0 71 mm d to 1 09 mm d thus model performance was deteriorated in exp4 in exp5 the flexd sg model was driven by forcing data based on linzhi station model performance was better than bomi in exp4 but inferior to theissen average in exp3 ikge in calibration was 0 85 and in validation ikge inse r2 irmse was 0 74 0 8 0 95 and 1 08 mm d respectively in exp6 the flexd sg model was driven by forcing data based on jiali station that is the only meteorological station within the yzr basin boundary flexd sg model has the best performance among all the six experiments ikge in calibration was high to 0 95 and in validation ikge inse r2 irmse were 0 94 0 93 0 97 and 0 66 mm d respectively the excellent hydrography simulation both calibration and split sample validation in exp6 illustrates its reliable model configuration to reproduce runoff the differences among exp3 6 results firstly illustrate the importance of precipitation data to drive hydrological models accurate precipitation input can significantly improve model performance in both calibration and validation periods secondly comparing with theissen polygon average precipitation single station precipitation jiali in this study performs even better since by thiessen polygon network method catchment rainfall is determined by a linear combination of the station rainfalls and the station weights this combination averaged out extreme precipitation events and simultaneously increased precipitation frequency and dramatically altered precipitation frequency duration curve which are important information to train hydrological models thus single station precipitation rather than theissen polygon average kept the original precipitation pattern likely provides more reliable input for hydrological model in mountainous regions 4 3 model realism test by internal variables internal variables including sca and gmb were used as further evaluation metrics to validate model performance besides hydrograph itself for sca simulations all the four experiments exp3 4 5 6 can reproduce its clear seasonal variation with largest sca in winter and least sca in summer in exp3 ikge inse r2 and irmse were 0 73 0 61 0 86 18 8 respectively in exp4 the flexd sg performance was deteriorated ikge inse r2 and irmse was 0 45 0 17 0 82 and 29 especially in summer time the model in exp4 dramatically overestimated the snow cover area fig 7 in exp5 ikge inse r2 and irmse was 0 77 0 63 0 82 18 9 and in exp6 the flexd sg has the best performance for sca simulation with ikge inse r2 and irmse of 0 78 0 65 0 86 18 0 respectively the results confirm that the precipitation data with jiali station has robust model performance not only for hydrograph but also for sca simulation since gmb field observation was absent in the yzr basin we used the remote sensing derived gmb of the yzr basin from 2000 to 2016 brun et al 2017 as another internal variable to test model performance because of the imperfect time overlap between remote sensing data and model simulation also the large uncertainty of remote sensing data itself we simply presented their uncertainty ranges rather than quantifying their difference fig 8 shows that all exp3 4 5 6 have reasonably well overlay with remote sensing gmb but it is difficult to conclude which performs better than the others while transferring the flex sg estimated gmb from yzr to the parlung zangbu glacier no 94 we kept the model parameters the same as yzr and merely changed the topography data fig 2b surprisingly the gmb results are not at all bad except for exp4 whose ikge 1 83 inse 2 74 r2 0 63 irmse 559 mm particularly given the absence of parameter recalibration and the long distance between the donor and receiver study sites three experiments exp3 exp5 exp6 have quite similar performance in gmb transferability test in exp3 the ikge inse r2 and irmse of observed gmb and averaged simulated gmb was 0 39 0 34 0 58 236 mm in exp5 ikge inse r2 and irmse was 0 52 0 30 0 58 242 mm in exp6 ikge inse r2 and irmse was 0 43 0 33 0 57 249 mm the gmb transferability testing results further confirmed and gave us more confidence on the model realism though internal variables validation we improved our understanding of this remote glacier basin at least in three aspects 1 internal variables provide orthogonal information except for hydrograph to test model realism in a data scarce basin 2 the robust flexd sg model with only one year calibration on hydrograph is sufficient to get the right answer for the right reasons which was strongly verified by remote sensing sca and gmb and even field monitored gmb in adjacent area 3 by comprehensive analysis of simulated hydrography and internal variables we found that the exp6 with flexd sg model driven by jiali forcing data the only meteorological station within basin boundary has better model realism than other experiments thus we did further analysis and reconstructed long term hydrography based on flexd sg model and jiali forcing data see section 4 5 4 4 parameters compensation with the improvement of model structure exp1 3 and different forcing inputs exp3 6 the model parameters were also compensated fig 9 shows that some parameters were sensitively changed in different experiments including s umax d and k s in rainfall runoff module t t and f dd in snowfall and snowmelt module the root zone storage capacity s umax was very small in exp1 and exp2 approximately 30 mm this is not consistent with our prior knowledge that the non glacier areas are covered by forest with large root zone storage capacity around 100 150 mm wang erlandsson et al 2016 this parameter behavior is because the flexd and flexd s did not have glacier module and the large runoff coefficient has to be generated by less evaporation loss achieved by unrealistically low s umax parameter values in non glacier response routine parameter d is close to 1 thus most generated runoff goes to fast reservoir because of limited runoff generation without glacier melt in flexd and flexd s models to meet the i kge performance the two models selected the parameters which could produce large peak flows with large d the small value of k s also confirmed this parameter behavior which leads to fast recession all these unusual parameters behavior means wrong model structure could force the model to fit hydrography by manipulating parameters resulting posterior parameters which were far from the reality with the improved model structure of flexd sg in exp3 6 by adding the glacier module not only the model performance has been dramatically improved fig 6 table 3 posterior ranges of model parameters were also closer to physical meanings fig 9 s umax was close to its physical meanings although still large uncertainty 100 150 mm the values of d was around 0 4 and k s changed to around 130 days interestingly the threshold temperature of snowfall and rainfall t t and the degree day factor of snowmelt f dd have clearly compensation patterns fig 9 shows that larger value of t t corresponds to less value of f dd exp3 5 and vice versa exp2 4 6 in future studies we need further investigation to constrain the compensation among these sensitive parameters 4 5 model results analysis and long term hydrography reconstruction with rigorous model realism test in exp6 through stepwise modeling and internal variables validation we are confident with its model configuration and its simulated results in exp6 the model showed that glacier with 24 3 area of the yzr basin contributed 59 of the total runoff whereas the non glacier area covering 75 7 of the catchment and only contributed 41 of the total runoff fig 10 this means with same area glacier contributes 3 5 times more runoff than non glacier area our finding is largely in agreement with previous research that glacier melting plays dominant role in streamflow in surrounding regions chen et al 2017 pritchard 2019 to further reveal the water balance in different elevation bands we classified the entire yzr basin into five elevation zones with equal area of 20 i e 4385 m 4385 4785 m 4785 5085 m 5085 5285 m and greater than 5285 m interestingly we found that the elevation band of 4385 4785 contributes the largest proportion of runoff of which glacier runoff contributes its dominant percentage table 4 it is worthwhile to clarify that we defined glacier runoff as the water that leaves the glacierized area huss and hock 2018 the detailed hydrograph components analysis of each elevation band can be found in table 4 based on the exp6 model configuration we run the flexd sg model to reconstruct the history daily runoff from both glacier and non glacier areas fig 11 the annual variation of total runoff from yzr basin was also reconstructed from 1961 to 2013 it was found that runoff was dramatically increased with annual increase of 359 7 m3 a r2 0 19 interestingly among this increase of total runoff non glacier area runoff increased 242 8 m3 a r2 0 20 and glacier area runoff increased 116 9 m3 a r2 0 04 which means the increase of precipitation in non glacier likely dominated the runoff increase although our model has been comprehensively tested by hydrograph and multiple internal variables there are still nonnegligible limitations especially for future response prediction in this study the glaciers area was regarded as a fixed input and its temporal variation was not considered due to data limitation of ice thickness maps and glacier response model parameters also the snow and ice melting module was merely based on temperature which works well at daily time step and large scale modeling but more factors and variables should be involved for more detailed and physically sound simulations hock 2005 finger et al 2012 schaner et al 2012 for example solar radiation yang et al 2010a 2010b tang et al 2019 he et al 2020 albedo wang et al 2014 and effect of topographic shading chen et al 2013 last but not least the uncertainty envelopes of model simulations were still large and should be further narrowed down with more restricted constrains from multi sources data 5 conclusions hydrological modeling in high latitude regions is a known challenge which is related to the complex snow glacier impacts on hydrological processes and the scarcity of in situ observations this study proposed a stepwise modeling framework to address these challenges and demonstrated in yigong zangbu river basin yzr which is located in the upper brahmaputra river from exp1 to exp2 and exp3 the conceptual hydrological model flexd was stepwisely included with snow and glacier processes and created flexd s and flexd sg models then from exp3 to exp6 different meteorology input data was used to force the flexd sg model we demonstrated that model structures that fail to represent the high latitude snow glacier processes were not able to accurately capture the observed streamflow time series even the model parameters are unrealistically overfitted exp1 and exp2 in contrast the full consideration of snow glacier impacts exp3 can substantially improve the streamflow simulation accuracy i kge increased from 0 48 to 0 94 in calibration and more in validation these results indicated that model structure was of vital importance which primarily determined model performance to further test the impact of meteorological forcing on runoff in this data scarce region we tested the forcing data of theissen average exp3 and three individual stations exp4 6 interestingly we found that 1 precipitation of a single station exp6 could outperform theissen average exp3 2 the flexd sg model with only one year calibration on hydrograph was sufficient to model both hydrograph and internal variables i e snow and glacier variations 3 internal variables validation demonstrates that a robust model configuration that realistically reflected the catchment hydrological processes was achieved in exp6 based on the well tested model configuration in exp6 we analyzed the simulated results and reconstructed the long term hydrography 1961 2013 in yzr basin to improve the potential competence to support decision making on water resources management in practice the proposed stepwise modeling framework provides a viable tool for such model structure diagnosing and realism testing therefore it is applicable to data poor regions and may significantly benefit hydrological modeling skills when catchment behavior is relatively unknown credit

5088,model realism is of vital importance in science of hydrology in terms of realistic representation of hydrological processes and reliability of future prediction here we employed a stepwise modeling approach that leverages flexible model structures and multi source observations for robust streamflow simulation and internal variables validation with improved model realism this framework is demonstrated in yigong zangbu river yzr basin a data scarce glacier basin in the upper brahmaputra river we designed six experiments exp1 6 to use modeling as a tool to understand hydrological processes in this remote cold basin with extremely high altitude in exp1 we started with a distributed rainfall runoff model flexd representing the case that snow and glacier processes were ignored then we stepwisely added snow and glacier processes into flexd denoted as flexd s exp2 and flexd sg exp3 respectively and such improvement of model structure led to significantly improved streamflow estimates to explore the impact of different precipitation forcing on model performance flexd sg was driven by theissen average exp3 and three individual stations precipitation exp4 6 the model realism was tested by observed hydrograph snow cover area sca and glacier mass balance gmb results showed that a robust and realistic hydrological modeling system was achieved in exp6 in this modeling study we learned that 1 stepwise modeling is effective in investigating catchment behavior and snow and glacier melting are the dominant hydrological processes in the yzr basin 2 internal variables validation is beneficial to test model realism in data scarce basin 3 the flexd sg model calibrated by only one year hydrograph is sufficient to reproduce snow and glacier variations 4 precipitation of a single station as forcing data could outperform theissen average 5 based on the well tested model configuration in exp6 we analyzed simulated results and reconstructed the long term hydrography 1961 2013 to support the potential competence for decision making on water resources management in practice the proposed framework may significantly improve our skills in hydrological modeling over data poor regions keywords glacier hydrology hydrological model remote sensing model realism upper brahmaputra river data scarce basin 1 introduction model realism i e getting the right answers for the right reasons kirchner 2006 beven 2018 is the long pursuit of hydrological scientists and modelers which is strongly related to our processes understanding and predictive power although model test schemes normally comprise split sample tests differential split sample tests and proxy site tests seibert et al 2000 refsgaard et al 2014 gao et al 2016 all these tests use discharge as the sole validation target this is firstly because streamflow is the most valuable water resource and the culprit for many water related hazards which are critical in hydrology and water resources studies additionally streamflow is an integrated representation of catchment hydrological processes and generally has relatively higher measurement accuracy than other hydrological components guse et al 2016 however streamflow averagely only accounts for 40 of global terrestrial precipitation oki and kanae 2006 seneviratne et al 2010 which is further reduced in arid regions wang and hejazi 2011 donohue et al 2012 as a result modeled parameters are likely overfitted to compensate the streamflow modeling errors thereby leading substantial uncertainty in hydrological predictions previous studies revealed that intrinsic uncertainties in the input data model structure and parameters are key factors undermining hydrological model realism immzerzial 2015 winter et al 2015 hattermann et al 2018 although it is widely accepted that we should consider model structure uncertainty and develop tailor made models for different catchments to represent their specific hydrological processes in diverse climatic geologic and hydrologic conditions the dominant practice in hydrological modeling is still one size fits all model structure rather than fit for purpose clark et al 2008 2015 fenicia et al 2011 this is firstly because tailor made hydrological models need strong expertise on modeling and with time and labor intensity moreover model structure and parameter uncertainties are highly relevant and intertwined which makes it difficult to understand the model structure uncertainty stepwise modeling approach in the umbrella of flexible model framework allows us to distinguish the impact of model structure uncertainty on model performance fenicia et al 2008 2011 increasing number of studies found that model structure is important in hydrological modeling savenije 2010 fenicia et al 2011 clark et al 2015 few modelling frameworks were developed to allow flexible model setup to systematically understand model structure uncertainty such as fuse framework for understanding structural errors clark et al 2008 superflex fenicia et al 2011 flex topo savenije 2010 gao et al 2014 gharari et al 2014 nijzink et al 2016 and summa structure for unifying multiple modeling alternatives clark et al 2015 flexible model structure and stepwise modeling allow us to gradually improve models as presentation of hydrological processes model development becomes a learning process fenicia et al 2008 rather than a prior determined model structure as a ready to use tool by adjusting parameters in different case studies clark et al 2008 fenicia et al 2011 internal variables validation with complementary data except for input forcing data e g precipitation and temperature and runoff are beneficial for the realism test with the development of advanced measurements by different platforms most hydrology components can be directly measured or derived by measurements at multi scales for instance the land surface fluxes observation includes lysimeter singh et al 2018 sap flow poyatos et al 2016 and eddy covariance baldocchi 2014 the tracer experiments including biogeochemistry birkel et al 2014 hrachowitz et al 2016 isotope evaristo and mcdonnell 2017 benettin et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 and dna dahlke et al 2015 provide essential information about the origin sources storage and mixing of subsurface water berghuijs and kirchner 2017 remote sensing data provides unprecedented spatial distribution information of almost all water balance components including but not limited to precipitation huffman et al 2007 tang et al 2018 duan et al 2019 water level frappart et al 2005 huang et al 2018b surface soil moisture entekhabi et al 2014 dong and crow 2019 evaporation anderson et al 2011 li et al 2019 and groundwater variation famiglietti et al 2015 long et al 2017 however many hydrological variable observations are also still with large uncertainties sun et al 2018a 2018b duan et al 2018 li et al 2019 and even more so for fluxes in subsurface flow pathways neuweiler and helmig 2017 pfister and kirchner 2017 in cold regions comparing with other counterparts the snow and glacier variation as dominant hydrological processes can be measured in a relatively accurate way huang et al 2016 chen et al 2017 kaab et al 2015 brun et al 2017 simply because most of these processes take place on land surface and with easily distinguishable spectral and stereo characteristics in cold regions satellite images provide powerful information for snow cover area duethmann et al 2014 ke et al 2016 huang et al 2017 chen et al 2018 snow depth tedesco et al 2010 che et al 2014 wang et al 2019 glacier area liu et al 2015 and glacier mass balance gardelle et al 2012 brun et al 2017 this provides us with a unique opportunity to test model realism by clear observable internal variables in model which have significant impact on catchment hydrology the brahmaputra river originated from the northern slope of the himalayas in china known as yalung zangbu river in chinese language together with ganges and meghna river basins the ganges brahmaputra meghna as one of the largest rivers in the world feeds 630 million people as an international river it affects irrigation fishery hydropower water supply and ecosystem conservation in china india bhutan and bangladesh despite the great significances for its riparian residents ecosystem and economy our hydrological knowledge at this region is still very scarce firstly because the extremely harsh restrictive environment and difficult accessibility have results in scarce measurements of meteorological and hydrological variables in this region huang et al 2018a 2018b moreover as an international river with large sensitive impact most of the limited gauged measurements can be even confidential and thus data sharing is also a big issue which further constrains conducting researches in this region huang et al 2020 hydrological model and remote sensing data provide powerful tools to quantify hydrological processes a few modeling studies have been conducted to understand hydrological processes in this region and surrounding areas mishra 2015 immerzeel et al 2014 chen et al 2017 huss and hock 2018 pritchard 2019 but most of those studies focused on global or continental scales with arbitrary prior parameters due to the lack of in situ observation leaving large uncertainty and big room for improvement satellite remote sensing has been used to derive various hydrological components or related variables in this region for example precipitation tang et al 2018 wang et al 2020 evaporation li et al 2019 snow cover area huang et al 2017 snow depth wang et al 2019 and glacier mass balance brun et al 2017 but with nonnegligible uncertainty due to the complex terrain and lack of ground calibration wang et al 2019 li et al 2019 precipitation as one of the most important hydrological components is closely relevant to almost all hydrological components in catchment hydrology but precipitation has particularly spatial heterogeneity in mountainous basins strongly influenced by complex terrain thus precise precipitation data is essential for model realism interestingly immerzeel et al 2015 found that glacier mass balances and runoff data could be used to inversely infer precipitation in another words model validation by internal variables e g gmb allows us to validate our water balance estimations even reversely verifying or questioning the input forcing data itself e g precipitation to address the challenge of model realism in a glacier basin in the upper brahmaputra river with data scarcity in this study 1 we stepwisely included snow and glacier modules in a distributed catchment rainfall runoff model to understand their importance on the hydrograph simulation 2 we tested whether the short term hydrograph data is sufficient to constrain model parameters and achieve realistic simulation 3 we tested the applicability of widely used theissen method in mountainous basins by comparing its model performance with three individual meteorology stations 4 model realism was tested not only by hydrograph but also by internal variables including snow cover area and glacier mass balance 5 based on the well tested model configuration we analyzed hydrograph components from glacier non glacier area and different elevation bands and reconstructed the long term runoff 1961 2013 to improve the potential competence to support decision making on water resources management in practice 2 study area and data 2 1 study sites the yigong zangbu river yzr basin one of the headwaters of brahmaputra river is located at the eastern tibetan plateau originates from the south eastern part of nyainqêntanglha mountain range 30 05 31 03 n 92 52 95 19 e the yzr basin covers a total area of about 13 406 km2 with an elevation ranges from 2134 to 6920 m fig 1 the rich precipitation from monsoon interact with the steep valley which contributes to the marine glacier landscape in the yzr basin glaciers cover 3258 km2 area 24 3 of the basin area the yzr basin is located at the junction of westerly indian ocean monsoon and southeastern monsoon the annual average precipitation from 1961 to 2013 was 835 mm a 676 mm a and 760 mm a at three meteorology stations bomi linzhi jiali precipitation during summer june july and august accounts for 70 annual mean air temperature is about 8 8 c 8 9 c and 0 33 c at bomi linzhi and jiali stations the annual average discharge from 1967 to 1969 was 810 mm a in terms of runoff depth which is even larger than annual precipitation implying the limited amount of evaporation and the important contribution from glacier melting 2 2 data and processing 2 2 1 topography and hydrological landscape analysis the shuttle radar topography mission srtm 90 m resolution digital elevation model dem map was obtained from united states geological survey usgs https earthexplorer usgs gov the glacier covered area was obtained from the second glacier inventory in china liu et al 2015 we firstly classified the entire yzr basin into two landscapes i e glacier and non glacier each landscape is further divided into 96 elevation bands with 50 m interval we did this fine resolution classifying most because of allowing more flexibility to simulate gmb and even the equilibrium line altitude gao et al 2017a furthermore to account for the influence of aspect on snow and glacier melting north 315 45 south 135 225 as well as east west 45 135 and 225 315 facing aspects were identified total 576 units were classified fig 2 the topography analysis of the adjacent parlung zangbu river pzr glacier no 94 was also conducted and presented in fig 2 2 2 2 meteorological and hydrological data we collected daily precipitation and air temperature data 1961 2013 from three meteorological stations at bomi linzhi and jiali with altitudes of 2736 m 2992 m and 4489 m respectively the annually averaged temperature and annual total precipitation are presented in fig 3 meteorological data was obtained from china meteorological administration cma with strict standard for data quality control remote sensing precipitation was not considered in this study because of it was not available in model calibration and validation period 1967 1969 and with large uncertainty in this region wang et al 2020 the runoff gauge station is located near the end of the yzb fig 1 due to the sensitivity of international river dataset daily runoff during 1967 1969 was the only hydrological data we accessed to evaluate the input forcing data we compared temperature and precipitation from three meteorological stations fig 4 it was found that temperature among three stations has excellent correlations r2 0 90 and 0 89 which indicates the strong spatial correlations of temperature and their reliable data quality monthly lapse rate was used to interpolate temperature to each elevations band the lapse rates from january to december are 0 910 0 948 0 895 0 842 0 788 0 704 0 626 0 618 0 660 0 748 0 819 and 0 827 c 100 m li et al 2013 but the correlations of three precipitation data are very weak with r2 as 0 06 and 0 07 fig 5 which indicates strong precipitation spatial heterogeneity in this region to obtain the average precipitation we employed the common used theissen polygon analysis in which jiali accounts for 55 bomi 37 and linzhi 8 of the average precipitation 2 2 3 snow cover area sca we validated our hydrological models using daily snow cover area sca data from 2000 to 2012 at the spatial resolution of 500 m huang et al 2016 the sca product was derived by combining mod10a1 and myd10a1 binary snow cover products of the modis terra and modis aqua daily v005 version huang et al 2016 since the snow cover products can only identify snow depth larger than 3 cm given the snow density of approximately 0 18 kg l on tibetan plateau thus the snow water equivalent swe 5 4 mm in hydrological model is not regarded as snow cover while performing comparison the remotely sensed snow depth was not included in model validation due to its coarse resolution and large uncertainty in this region huang et al 2016 chen et al 2017 2 2 4 glacier mass balance gmb data there was no field glacier monitoring within the yzr basin satellite observed annual average gmb was 0 6 80 23 m w e a 1 from 2000 to 2016 which was converted by the change of elevation derived from satellite stereo imagery and the change of glacier area from optical satellite brun et al 2017 additionally the field gmb monitor from 1975 to 2013 in adjacent parlung zangbu river pzr glacier no 94 yang et al 2010a 2010b yao et al 2010 liu 2020 was involved as another important internal variable to test model transferability and realism figs 1 2 8 3 methodology 3 1 model description topography and landscape analysis provided the distributed framework to interpolate meteorology forcing data and hydrological processes in the umbrella of superflex fenicia et al 2011 we firstly extended the lumped rainfall runoff flex model gao et al 2016 to distributed flexd based on topography and landscape classification subsequently we stepwisely involved snow and glacier modules developed flexd s and flexd sg models to test their model performance on hydrography and validate their internal fluxes 3 1 1 rainfall runoff module in flexd model only rainfall runoff process was involved without considering snow and glacier processes rainfall directly enters the unsaturated reservoir s u characterized by 1 d s u d t p e a r u where e a is the evaporation which was estimated on the basis of potential evaporation estimated by hamon equation driven by air temperature hamon 1961 and relative soil moisture s u over root zone storage capacity s umax with an evaporation threshold parameter c e r u mm day is the runoff generation from unsaturated reservoir s u gao et al 2014 r u is split by a parameter d and recharges two separate linear reservoirs s f and s s which respectively represents the process of subsurface storm flow q f mm day and groundwater flow q s mm day where r f mm day is the recharge entering the fast response reservoir and r s mm day is the recharge entering the slow response reservoir k f day is the recession parameter of the fast response reservoir and k s day is the recession parameter of the slow response reservoir the detailed model structure is shown in fig 5 and the description of parameters are illustrated in table 1 and detailed equations can refer to gao et al 2017a 2017b 3 1 2 snowfall and snowmelt module whether the precipitation is snowfall p s or rainfall depends on various factors ding et al 2014 interestingly han et al 2010 analyzed large sample meteorological data in china and found that a single threshold temperature has sufficient accuracy to split snowfall and rainfall the single threshold temperature method determines precipitation phase by whether the daily average air temperature t is above or below a threshold temperature t t 2 p s p t t t 0 t t t for snowmelt simulation there are two types of models i e energy balance model and temperature index model hock 2005 due to data limitations in our study and the well reported robustness at daily scale gao et al 2012 2016 2017a 2017b 2018 the parsimonious temperature index model was employed in this study since snow cover on tibetan plateau is quite thin to avoid parameters equifinality and model uncertainty we did not consider the snow pack as porous media neither its water capacity nor water refreezing in snow cover the degree day factor f dd is another vital parameter in snowmelting on the basis of the degree day factor snowmelt m s can be calculated by the positive temperature according to numerous field based measurements in china zhang et al 2006 the prior range of f dd was set as 0 5 10 mm c day 81 because the detailed energy balance observations are lacking a conceptual multiplier c a set as 1 2 was introduced to quantify the influence of aspect on snow and ice melt the f dd in south facing aspect was multiplied by c a while the north facing aspects was multiplied by 1 c a and the east west facing aspects are kept as f dd modeled sca is the accumulated area of elevation bands with swe larger than 5 4 mm 3 d s w d t p s m s 4 m s f dd t c a t 0 0 t 0 snow sublimation e ag was estimated by

be noticed that because of the lower albedo of the ice the degree day factor for glacier is larger than the snow degree day factor in the same region similarly we set its prior range according to

generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method beven and freer 2001 was used to conduct parameters uncertainty analysis and automatic parameter calibration in this study as a classic approach to quantify parameter uncertainty beven and binley 2014 monte carlo experiments provide parameter sampling to analyze the sensitivity of models to their parameters the runoff data in 1967 were used as calibration and runoff data in 1968 and 1969 were used as split sample validation the prior range of parameter sets of three models flexd flexd s flexd sg are shown in table 1 a monte carlo sampling strategy with 20 000 realizations from uniform prior parameter distributions was chosen to obtain posterior distributions of the free model parameters we selected 1 of the prior parameter sets i e 200 as the behavioral ones the kling gupta efficiency i kge was used as the objective function to quantify model performance in calibration gupta et al 2009 10 i kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β

simulated and mean observed flows besides i kge nash sutcliff efficiency i nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 eq 11 coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error i rmse were used to quantify the model performance in streamflow split sample validation and internal variables validation i e sca and gmb 11 i nse 1 t 1 n q o q m 2 t 1 n q o q o 2 where q o is observed runoff q o is the observed average runoff and q m is modeled runoff 3 3 experiments design six experiments were designed table 2 to stepwisely understand the impact of rainfall runoff exp1 snow exp2 and glacier exp3 modules on streamflow simulation and the impact of different precipitation inputs exp3 6 on model performance in streamflow gmb and sca simulations exp1 the rainfall runoff flexd model was driven by distributed temperature data from jiali station with monthly temperature lapse rate and theissen polygon average precipitation flexd was calibrated based on precipitation streamflow data in 1967 the data in 1968 and 1969 were used as validation data exp2 we involved the snow module including snowfall and snowmelt into flexd to develop the flexd s model flexd s was driven by the same forcing data as flexd calibration and validation data were same as exp1 exp3 exp6 glacier melt was further considered and developed flexd sg in exp3 forcing data and calibration data were kept the same as exp1 and exp2 based on jiali temperature and theissen average precipitation in exp4 exp5 and exp6 we changed the forcing data temperature and precipitation to bomi linzhi and jiali to test the impact of different forcing data mainly precipitation on model performance model structure calibration validation and internal variables model test were all kept the same as exp3 for model validation besides observed runoff we further used the multi sources sca and gmb observations to validate internal fluxes 4 results and discussion 4 1 the importance of model structure fig 6 and table 3 show the performance of each model flexd flexd s flexd sg in both calibration and split sample validation in exp1 exp2 and exp3 with the same forcing data in exp1 the simulation failed to capture the observed streamflow time series in calibration i kge was 0 48 and in validation i kge i nse r2 i rmse were 0 38 0 14 0 61 and 2 27 mm d respectively in exp2 snow module was included which moderately improved the model performance with i kge of 0 56 in calibration and values of i kge i nse r2 i rmse as 0 49 0 46 0 80 1 79 mm d in validation in exp3 after considering the glacier processes flexd sg model had dramatic improvements with i kge of 0 94 in calibration and values of i kge i nse r2 i rmse as 0 86 0 92 0 97 0 71 mm d in validation respectively by comparison from exp1 to exp3 after considering snow and glacier modules model performance on hydrography simulation demonstrated stepwisely improvements in exp1 and exp2 flexd and flexd s cannot mimic hydrography well even the parameters are overfitted indicating model structure realism dominates the model performance in this study which cannot be compensated by parameter calibration 4 2 theissen average and individual station precipitation figs 3 and 4 show that air temperatures are closely correlated in three stations at both daily and annual scales the r2 of jiali and bomi daily temperature is 0 90 and 0 89 for jiali and linzhi the strong correlated temperature among three stations indicates that temperature has regular spatial pattern and it is reliable to use temperature lapse rate to interpolate distributed temperature however the daily precipitation r2 of jiali and bomi was merely 0 06 and 0 07 for jiali and linzhi the different annual precipitation variation of three stations also indicates the strong spatial heterogeneous precipitation this weak correlation among different stations does not allow us to interpolate precipitation by simple lapse rate method thus from exp3 to exp6 we used theissen average precipitation and three individual station precipitation bomi linzhi jiali as input to force the flexd sg model from exp3 to exp4 precipitation input changed from theissen average to bomi station and temperature input changed from jiali to bomi the ikge in calibration reduced from 0 94 to 0 81 and in validation ikge inse r2 were reduced from 0 86 0 92 0 97 to 0 78 0 80 0 93 respectively while irmse was increased from 0 71 mm d to 1 09 mm d thus model performance was deteriorated in exp4 in exp5 the flexd sg model was driven by forcing data based on linzhi station model performance was better than bomi in exp4 but inferior to theissen average in exp3 ikge in calibration was 0 85 and in validation ikge inse r2 irmse was 0 74 0 8 0 95 and 1 08 mm d respectively in exp6 the flexd sg model was driven by forcing data based on jiali station that is the only meteorological station within the yzr basin boundary flexd sg model has the best performance among all the six experiments ikge in calibration was high to 0 95 and in validation ikge inse r2 irmse were 0 94 0 93 0 97 and 0 66 mm d respectively the excellent hydrography simulation both calibration and split sample validation in exp6 illustrates its reliable model configuration to reproduce runoff the differences among exp3 6 results firstly illustrate the importance of precipitation data to drive hydrological models accurate precipitation input can significantly improve model performance in both calibration and validation periods secondly comparing with theissen polygon average precipitation single station precipitation jiali in this study performs even better since by thiessen polygon network method catchment rainfall is determined by a linear combination of the station rainfalls and the station weights this combination averaged out extreme precipitation events and simultaneously increased precipitation frequency and dramatically altered precipitation frequency duration curve which are important information to train hydrological models thus single station precipitation rather than theissen polygon average kept the original precipitation pattern likely provides more reliable input for hydrological model in mountainous regions 4 3 model realism test by internal variables internal variables including sca and gmb were used as further evaluation metrics to validate model performance besides hydrograph itself for sca simulations all the four experiments exp3 4 5 6 can reproduce its clear seasonal variation with largest sca in winter and least sca in summer in exp3 ikge inse r2 and irmse were 0 73 0 61 0 86 18 8 respectively in exp4 the flexd sg performance was deteriorated ikge inse r2 and irmse was 0 45 0 17 0 82 and 29 especially in summer time the model in exp4 dramatically overestimated the snow cover area fig 7 in exp5 ikge inse r2 and irmse was 0 77 0 63 0 82 18 9 and in exp6 the flexd sg has the best performance for sca simulation with ikge inse r2 and irmse of 0 78 0 65 0 86 18 0 respectively the results confirm that the precipitation data with jiali station has robust model performance not only for hydrograph but also for sca simulation since gmb field observation was absent in the yzr basin we used the remote sensing derived gmb of the yzr basin from 2000 to 2016 brun et al 2017 as another internal variable to test model performance because of the imperfect time overlap between remote sensing data and model simulation also the large uncertainty of remote sensing data itself we simply presented their uncertainty ranges rather than quantifying their difference fig 8 shows that all exp3 4 5 6 have reasonably well overlay with remote sensing gmb but it is difficult to conclude which performs better than the others while transferring the flex sg estimated gmb from yzr to the parlung zangbu glacier no 94 we kept the model parameters the same as yzr and merely changed the topography data fig 2b surprisingly the gmb results are not at all bad except for exp4 whose ikge 1 83 inse 2 74 r2 0 63 irmse 559 mm particularly given the absence of parameter recalibration and the long distance between the donor and receiver study sites three experiments exp3 exp5 exp6 have quite similar performance in gmb transferability test in exp3 the ikge inse r2 and irmse of observed gmb and averaged simulated gmb was 0 39 0 34 0 58 236 mm in exp5 ikge inse r2 and irmse was 0 52 0 30 0 58 242 mm in exp6 ikge inse r2 and irmse was 0 43 0 33 0 57 249 mm the gmb transferability testing results further confirmed and gave us more confidence on the model realism though internal variables validation we improved our understanding of this remote glacier basin at least in three aspects 1 internal variables provide orthogonal information except for hydrograph to test model realism in a data scarce basin 2 the robust flexd sg model with only one year calibration on hydrograph is sufficient to get the right answer for the right reasons which was strongly verified by remote sensing sca and gmb and even field monitored gmb in adjacent area 3 by comprehensive analysis of simulated hydrography and internal variables we found that the exp6 with flexd sg model driven by jiali forcing data the only meteorological station within basin boundary has better model realism than other experiments thus we did further analysis and reconstructed long term hydrography based on flexd sg model and jiali forcing data see section 4 5 4 4 parameters compensation with the improvement of model structure exp1 3 and different forcing inputs exp3 6 the model parameters were also compensated fig 9 shows that some parameters were sensitively changed in different experiments including s umax d and k s in rainfall runoff module t t and f dd in snowfall and snowmelt module the root zone storage capacity s umax was very small in exp1 and exp2 approximately 30 mm this is not consistent with our prior knowledge that the non glacier areas are covered by forest with large root zone storage capacity around 100 150 mm wang erlandsson et al 2016 this parameter behavior is because the flexd and flexd s did not have glacier module and the large runoff coefficient has to be generated by less evaporation loss achieved by unrealistically low s umax parameter values in non glacier response routine parameter d is close to 1 thus most generated runoff goes to fast reservoir because of limited runoff generation without glacier melt in flexd and flexd s models to meet the i kge performance the two models selected the parameters which could produce large peak flows with large d the small value of k s also confirmed this parameter behavior which leads to fast recession all these unusual parameters behavior means wrong model structure could force the model to fit hydrography by manipulating parameters resulting posterior parameters which were far from the reality with the improved model structure of flexd sg in exp3 6 by adding the glacier module not only the model performance has been dramatically improved fig 6 table 3 posterior ranges of model parameters were also closer to physical meanings fig 9 s umax was close to its physical meanings although still large uncertainty 100 150 mm the values of d was around 0 4 and k s changed to around 130 days interestingly the threshold temperature of snowfall and rainfall t t and the degree day factor of snowmelt f dd have clearly compensation patterns fig 9 shows that larger value of t t corresponds to less value of f dd exp3 5 and vice versa exp2 4 6 in future studies we need further investigation to constrain the compensation among these sensitive parameters 4 5 model results analysis and long term hydrography reconstruction with rigorous model realism test in exp6 through stepwise modeling and internal variables validation we are confident with its model configuration and its simulated results in exp6 the model showed that glacier with 24 3 area of the yzr basin contributed 59 of the total runoff whereas the non glacier area covering 75 7 of the catchment and only contributed 41 of the total runoff fig 10 this means with same area glacier contributes 3 5 times more runoff than non glacier area our finding is largely in agreement with previous research that glacier melting plays dominant role in streamflow in surrounding regions chen et al 2017 pritchard 2019 to further reveal the water balance in different elevation bands we classified the entire yzr basin into five elevation zones with equal area of 20 i e 4385 m 4385 4785 m 4785 5085 m 5085 5285 m and greater than 5285 m interestingly we found that the elevation band of 4385 4785 contributes the largest proportion of runoff of which glacier runoff contributes its dominant percentage table 4 it is worthwhile to clarify that we defined glacier runoff as the water that leaves the glacierized area huss and hock 2018 the detailed hydrograph components analysis of each elevation band can be found in table 4 based on the exp6 model configuration we run the flexd sg model to reconstruct the history daily runoff from both glacier and non glacier areas fig 11 the annual variation of total runoff from yzr basin was also reconstructed from 1961 to 2013 it was found that runoff was dramatically increased with annual increase of 359 7 m3 a r2 0 19 interestingly among this increase of total runoff non glacier area runoff increased 242 8 m3 a r2 0 20 and glacier area runoff increased 116 9 m3 a r2 0 04 which means the increase of precipitation in non glacier likely dominated the runoff increase although our model has been comprehensively tested by hydrograph and multiple internal variables there are still nonnegligible limitations especially for future response prediction in this study the glaciers area was regarded as a fixed input and its temporal variation was not considered due to data limitation of ice thickness maps and glacier response model parameters also the snow and ice melting module was merely based on temperature which works well at daily time step and large scale modeling but more factors and variables should be involved for more detailed and physically sound simulations hock 2005 finger et al 2012 schaner et al 2012 for example solar radiation yang et al 2010a 2010b tang et al 2019 he et al 2020 albedo wang et al 2014 and effect of topographic shading chen et al 2013 last but not least the uncertainty envelopes of model simulations were still large and should be further narrowed down with more restricted constrains from multi sources data 5 conclusions hydrological modeling in high latitude regions is a known challenge which is related to the complex snow glacier impacts on hydrological processes and the scarcity of in situ observations this study proposed a stepwise modeling framework to address these challenges and demonstrated in yigong zangbu river basin yzr which is located in the upper brahmaputra river from exp1 to exp2 and exp3 the conceptual hydrological model flexd was stepwisely included with snow and glacier processes and created flexd s and flexd sg models then from exp3 to exp6 different meteorology input data was used to force the flexd sg model we demonstrated that model structures that fail to represent the high latitude snow glacier processes were not able to accurately capture the observed streamflow time series even the model parameters are unrealistically overfitted exp1 and exp2 in contrast the full consideration of snow glacier impacts exp3 can substantially improve the streamflow simulation accuracy i kge increased from 0 48 to 0 94 in calibration and more in validation these results indicated that model structure was of vital importance which primarily determined model performance to further test the impact of meteorological forcing on runoff in this data scarce region we tested the forcing data of theissen average exp3 and three individual stations exp4 6 interestingly we found that 1 precipitation of a single station exp6 could outperform theissen average exp3 2 the flexd sg model with only one year calibration on hydrograph was sufficient to model both hydrograph and internal variables i e snow and glacier variations 3 internal variables validation demonstrates that a robust model configuration that realistically reflected the catchment hydrological processes was achieved in exp6 based on the well tested model configuration in exp6 we analyzed the simulated results and reconstructed the long term hydrography 1961 2013 in yzr basin to improve the potential competence to support decision making on water resources management in practice the proposed stepwise modeling framework provides a viable tool for such model structure diagnosing and realism testing therefore it is applicable to data poor regions and may significantly benefit hydrological modeling skills when catchment behavior is relatively unknown credit

5089,the objective of this paper is to empirically test the explanatory ability of cultural capital which is generally considered more qualitatively and rarely quantified for farmers water conservation behavior in applying this approach we reflect the growing interest in the role of culture and identity in influencing farmer s decision making the study design involved a cross sectional survey of growers in the aleshtar county in western iran the sample consisted of 360 farmers the results of person correlation test showed significant relationships between all forms of cultural capital and both intention to behave and behavior furthermore structural equation model analysis revealed that the embodied and objective forms of capital predicted about 43 of the variance in farmers intention moreover the institutionalised objective intension and family experiences predicted about 45 of the variance in farmers behavior based on the research results recommendations for water conservation were provided keywords water conservation embodied cultural capital objective cultural capital institutionalised cultural capital farmer behavior 1 introduction achieving and maintaining food security has always been a top priority internationally due to national welfare and political stability concerns del ninno et al 2007 however the current widespread nature of food and nutrition security problems pimentel and pimentel 2007 nooghabi et al 2018 and a rapidly rising global population fao 2003 give cause for concern about the growing insecurity of world food supplies and the vulnerability of human health and productivity pimentel and pimentel 2007 nooghabi et al 2018 these concerns are exacerbated by a range of factors including war conflict soil degradation economic crises climate change urbanization industrialization intellectual property issues income and consumption growth changes in lifestyle food price fluctuations and turbulence in global energy and food markets khan et al 2009 allouche 2011 yazdanpanah et al 2013b azadi et al 2019a boazar et al 2019 aliabadi et al 2020 delfiyan et al 2020 increasing emphasis in western countries on the development of a bioeconomy oecd 2009 where agricultural land can potentially be used to produce biomass feedstock for industry may add further pressure as is already occurring with the conversion of food products to fuels khan et al 2009 while there are many different components to this crisis the production of food remains both the underlying goal and when enhanced the solution and instrument for many countries in dryer regions of the world which are experiencing some of the greatest population growth the main problem continues to be access to water the key driver of agricultural production hanjra and qureshi 2010 for example in cases such as southern india over extraction of water and failure of adequate replenishment is resulting in widespread and alarming falls in the water table ferrant et al 2014 iranian farmers have similarly viewed water tables drop wells have dried up and previously productive lands being enforced out of productive use hayati et al 2010 tajeri moghadam et al 2020 shojaei miandoragh et al 2019 this scarcity of water is becoming increasingly closely linked to the issue of food security falkenmark 2001 pakmehr et al 2020b it has been estimated that in the near future nearly half of the earth s inhabitants will unable to mobilize the water needed to guarantee food self sufficiency kummu et al 2014 consequently there is an urgent need to understand the management of water resources with the focus on encouraging the agricultural sector to use less water while maintaining or enhancing the quantity and quality of food produced farmers utilization of water resources is at the center of this focus in iran a recent water crisis has caused the government to make a transition from its traditional water management approach supply side driven to a more demand driven approach yazdanpanah et al 2013a veisi et al 2020 kazemi et al 2018 nasrabadi et al 2013 as a consumer of 90 to 93 of water resources tatar et al 2019 the agricultural sector has become the main goal for new initiatives from a demand approach such as water conservation activities valizadeh et al 2019 hence the main question for policy makers is how to motivate individual farmers to apply the water conservation activities that are vital for the success of any water management policy pakmehr et al 2020a due to low and centrally subsidized prices for agricultural water irrigation has not been used very efficiently in the past rezadoost and allahyari 2014 boazar et al 2020 mohammadinezhad and ahmadvand 2020 consequently any attempt to introduce voluntary measures to improve individuals water usage necessitates first knowledge of those present activities and second a knowledge of how those activities can be transformed yazdanpanah et al 2014 the objective of this paper is to empirically test the influence of cultural capital on farmers water conservation behavior this reflects a growing interest in the importance of culture and self identity to understandfarmers behavior wilson et al 2013 lokhorst et al 2014 the paper is divided into four sections first we review theories of farmer behavior to establish a theoretical basis of the research second we present the methodology employed in the study third we use regression analysis to explore the role of the different components of cultural capital objectified embodied institutionalized in contributing to water conservation behavior finally we discuss the results in particular analyzing a the potential for using components of cultural capital in models of farmers behavior and b the implications of understanding the cultural capital behavior link for the promotion of water conservation in iran and countries with similar water issues 2 understanding farmer s water conservation behaviour the case for a capitals approach current global moves towards more neoliberal forms of governance pushed by globalisation and trade agreements and their emphasis on voluntary action combined with growing concern for environmental and food security issues mean that at the same time as needing to change individual behaviour regulation is decreasingly seen as the solution this places a high importance on understanding how to induce voluntary behavioural change however understanding human behaviour is an extremely complex and difficult task ajzen 1991 janssen and jager 2000 it has been approached from many different angles ranging from the perspective of economic rationality at one extreme to a focus on understanding the influence of socio psychological factors at the other with the entire spectrum of approaches contributing to the development of policies to promote behavioural change collier et al 2010 in this sector we present the theoretical case for an additional perspective that of cultural capital as a means of better understanding farmer behaviour the section begins by discussing short comings with the two most commonly applied frameworks jackson 2005 rational economic models rems and attitude behavioural models abms see rolls 2001 jackson 2005 collier et al 2010 and then briefly outlines why incorporating the concept of cultural capital could address some of the shortcomings of existing approaches 2 1 the rational economic model rem and behavioural change economics at the microeconomic level neoclassical economics is essentially about how people make decisions and take choices and offers powerful tools to change behaviour which are utilised often and effectively by government collier et al 2010 the rational economic model is grounded on the key premises that individual preferences provide the foundation for all human activity and rational activity is the result of cognitive deliberation hassell and cary 2007 consequently decisions are related to an internalised cost benefit assessment with the behaviour chosen being the one that maximizes the expected net benefit hassell and cary 2007 pearce et al 2007 jarrett 2015 a number of assumptions are made in the model the most important ones being that a a sovereign individual also called an actor or economic agent has preferences that can be represented by a utility function and b that the individual possesses perfect information or searches optimally and behaves consistently according to stable preferences folmer 2009 for achieving pro environmental choices rem is dependent on a defined set of conditions being met perfect information and perfect competition collier et al 2010 the rem model is commonly used to construct tools for policy makers jackson 2005 and shapes government policies in areas such as taxation and subsidies see vugt 2001 campbell et al 2004 despite widespread use of the rem model the rem s many axioms and assumptions have been heavily criticised on the basis that they are too rigorous and lead to far reaching abstractions from reality which in turn means they have inadequate descriptive and analytical power rol 2008 many authors from the field of ecological economics have stated an uneasiness with the neoclassical behavioural model with some even suggesting that it is partly responsible for setting the wrong agenda for environmental policy making costanza et al 1991 gardner and stern 2002 jackson 2005 also distinguishes that private choices do not always take account of social costs or wider environmental interests he adds that a degree of routine enters our behaviour making it much more difficult to change and undermining a key assumption of the rational choice model jarrett 2015 jackson 2005 gardner and stern 2002 furthermore the rem does not adequately acknowledge the limits on an individual s capability to take deliberative actions and the manner in which people respond to affective or emotional influences hassell and cary 2007 in sum literature on individual decisions and adoption of change have revealed that monetary models have been incapable to explain how individuals actually make choices slovic et al 1977 simon 1978 gardner and stern 2002 jarrett 2015 yazdanpanah et al 2016 the theoretical short comings of the rem can have real effects on policy outcomes for example by creating economic motivations for actions that were previously motivated by normative factors behavioural change under this model can lead to the so called economization of society bovenberg van de klundert 2006 cited in folmer 2009 where previously intrinsically motivated behaviours become financially motivated see deci and ryan 2002 this crowding out effect of non self interested and non monetary stimulus by economic motivations has been recognised since the 1970s de snoo et al 2013 furthermore promoting behavioural change through financial incentives can have negative effects in that people often revert to old ways when incentives end or regulations are no longer enforced and so long term protection may be compromised pretty 2003 1914 thus although decision makers tend to place high expectations on agri environment contracts as an instrument to control environmental externalities such payments usually miscarry to bring about long lasting variations in behaviours de snoo et al 2013 2 2 non economic attitudinal models and behavioural change to address failings in the rem approach non economic perspectives are increasingly being applied to understand farmer s behaviour and behavioural change azadi et al 2019b of these the dominant approach involves attempting to understand and change the attitudes that farmers hold towards any particular policy objective both in terms of strict quantitative models and more qualitative approaches e g the behavioural approach morris and potter 1995 attitudes are universally accepted as playing a key role in determining behaviour this has not always been the case prior to the mid 1970s the relationship between attitude and behaviour was believed to be unreliable and it was only with the development of the theory of reasoned action tra fishbein and ajzen 1975 that the significance of attitude was finally confirmed the key to the success of this model was the inclusion of subjective norms the influence of significant others along with the introduction of intended behaviour as an intermediary construct between attitudes and behaviours in the following decades researchers found a number of additional constructs that could contribute significantly to behaviour in particular self efficacy habit moral obligation and self identity further refinements were made by ajzen 1985 ajzen 1991 with the inclusion of perceived behavioural control a self efficacy construct into the renamed theory of planned behaviour tpb it is this model that now dominates literature into the relationship between attitudes and behaviour attitudinal perspectives on behaviour increased significantly in importance with the introduction of voluntary environmental programs in the european union under article 19 of the farm structures regulations in 1987 and later the mcsharry reforms of 1992 which saw the widespread implementation of agri environment measures aems low uptake of payment schemes in the early stages of implementation prompted a dramatic increase in interest in non economic motivational factors and resulted in numerous studies looking at farmers attitudes towards the environment e g austin et al 1998 while some studies applied behavioural models directly from social psychology carr and tait 1990 beedell and rehman 1999 the majority of studies followed a more general behavioural approach where attitudes were measured but information about the structural condition of the farm including the economic position was also gathered to help explain the influence of structural conditions e g morris and potter 1995 while the measurement of attitudes adds an important additional perspective to rem approaches a number of recent studies have suggested that the relationship between farmers environmental attitudes and environmental behaviour is weak e g hassell and cary 2007 the reason for this is uncertain on the one hand many of the behavioural approach models fail to adhere to the strict conditions for the model to function as laid out in the social psychology literature for example by simplifying attitude questions not measuring the expectations attached to the attitudes leaving out measures of subjective norm using single items to measure attitudes rather than multi item scales and so on on the other hand the application of strict models is also problematic for example beedell and rehman 2000 126 found from their application of the tpb model to farmers environmental behaviour that the process was very time consuming with the precise nature of question wording required making the process appear contorted to the respondents this need to focus on the model also meant their study was unable to consider the multitude of structural and historical factors known to have a significant impact on farmer s behaviour such as the effect of farm development or farmer life cycles on landscape change however the cause of the weak relationships may also be that the connection between environmental attitudes and behaviour is genuinely poor one possible reason for this is that the notion of a predictable and therefore targetable link between attitudes and behaviour is predicated on the belief that an individual can only hold a single attitude at a particular time if individuals hold multiple attitudes simultaneously behaviour will be dependent not on attitude but which attitude is expressed and thus what determines the expression of attitude one example of this is the dual attitude theory this postulates that individuals can hold two attitudes to the same object in the same context simultaneously the result of an old attitude being replaced by a new one but where one is implicit or habitual and lies outside of the person s awareness whereas the other is explicit and where the expression can be consciously controlled wilson et al 2000 another theory suggests that self identity is comprised of multiple and hierarchal identities with each identity holding an internalised understanding of the significance of attitudes and behaviours of the particular peer group stryker 1980 as identities become salient due to contextual triggers e g entering a religious place so the attitudes and behaviours associated with the salient identity will become prevalent rather than attitude behaviour being consistent across all identities and contexts see burton and wilson 2006 2 3 the behavioural influence of cultural capital while economic capital forms the single basis of our economic behavioural models cultural and social capital as forms of accumulated labour in the context of agricultural production have received very limited attention in the literature however since the 1970s studies have illustrated that economic capital alone does not motivate farmers behaviour research by gasson 1973 for example illustrated that farmers main goals were intrinsically rather than economically motivated with the main reasons for farming being associated with enjoying the job and being able to make independent decisions in another example coughenour 1976 found that many sheep farmers wool growers in australia were not making the then economically rational decision to convert from sheep to beef farming because they were embedded within a community of sheep farmers that provided them with prestige and social approval conversion to cattle would result in cessation of the activities and interactions associated with sheep farming which in turn would result in a loss of these non economic forms of capital coughenour used homans 1974 social exchange theory this acted as a disincentive to behavioural change even when if economic capital alone was considered the decision to convert was entirely rational the possibility that non economic forms of capital may influence farmers decision making has recently been raised in a body of literature that focuses on the role of cultural capital in behavioural choice see burton and paragahawewa 2011 sutherland and burton 2011 burton 2012 riley 2016 this work applies the capitals theoretical framework of french sociologist pierre bourdieu see bourdieu 1986 to understand farmer s resistance to change bourdieu s key premise was that economic capital has become the focus of our understanding of capital only because of its unambiguous immediacy and the transparency of economic exchanges and that this has led to the neglect of other forms of accumulated labour he suggests that capital exists in three fundamental forms economic capital investments in resources as material property social capital investments in resources that can be mobilised via social connections and mutual obligations and cultural capital investments in knowledge skills dispositions recognition from culturally relevant organisations and possession of culturally significant objects cultural capital is said to exist in three forms namely institutionalised qualifications or recognition from official institutions that effectively provide certificates of cultural competence e g best in show awards agricultural qualifications objectified capital incorporated in material objects of high status value e g a new tractor or a well tended tidy field burton 2012 and embodied capital present as learned skills knowledge dispositions sensibilities and so on e g when to plough how to drive a tractor shared cultural perspectives on agriculture in addition bourdieu contends that capital transfers between the main forms through symbolic capital status prestige and reputation such that for example economic capital can be exchanged for cultural capital through investment in education and in turn cultural capital education provides access to both economic and social capital it is important to note that knowledge skill qualifications and material objects alone do not necessarily provide symbolic capital but it is when this knowledge is culturally relevant i e represents a source of prestige or status that it has implications beyond simple efficacy see bourdieu 1986 it can also be used to generate social capital in particular embodied cultural capital inculcates within individuals the dispositions and manners that facilitate the types of appropriate sociability which allow the alchemy of consecration to transform contingent relationships into relations of mutual obligation holt 2008 p 232 in other words cultural capital can be used for the purpose of establishing or reproducing social relationships that are directly usable in the short or long term bourdieu 1986 p 52 possessing the relevant embodied cultural capital enables one to act consciously or subconsciously in appropriate ways within social networks and makes the inclusion of the individual within social networks desirable to be accepted within a peer group you must have relevant cultural capital and in the case of farmers there is evidence that embodied cultural capital in the form of skills and knowledge in agriculture is critical for acceptance within the community as a good farmer burton et al 2008 2020 a key part of how cultural capital guides behaviour and therefore how it differs from attitudinal based approaches lies in its connection with what bourdieu terms habitus a socialised body a structured body a body which has incorporated the immanent structures of a world or of a particular sector of that world a field and which structures the perception of that world as well as action within that world bourdieu 1998 p 81 thus the actor s habitus composed of the generic transposable characteristics that represent the cultural capital of the individual holt 1997 combines social and structural elements into a body that possesses a subconscious framework for operating within their world through socialisation there is a strong historical aspect to the concept with habitus being passed through families from generation to generation bourdieu is clear that while the habitus offers a subconscious route that disposes the individual towards culturally determined courses of action it does not exclude deliberative behaviour he notes it is of course never ruled out that the responses of the habitus may be accompanied by a strategic calculation tending to perform in a conscious mode the operation that the habitus performs quite differently but these responses are first defined without any calculation in relation to objective potentialities immediately inscribed in the present things to do or not to do things to say or not to say bourdeiu 1990 p 53 cultural capital thus lays out a set of cultural rules within which deliberative decisions are made in this sense habitus is not equated with habit as sometimes measured in the tpb further while objectified institutional and embodied cultural forms of capital have some similarities with aspects measured in the tpb e g new or large machinery is likely to simultaneously generate objectified cultural capital and increase perceived behavioural control the overall cultural capital framework measures the influence of the embedded cultural part of decision making i e not directly measurable in psychometric surveys as a socialised cultural construct cultural capital is likely to be more important in communities with strong social ties in the case of agriculture which generally still involves communities of family farmers that have been on the same farm and worked together for generations if not centuries we contend that cultural capital and the habitus play a particularly important role in structuring behavioural choice a framework based on cultural capital also builds on the economic approaches to decision making bourdieu 1986 criticises economic approaches to capital as reducing the universe of exchanges to mercantile exchange whereas in reality exchange is also present in the immaterial forms of social and cultural capital a cultural capital approach to understanding behaviour proposes that the economically most viable option can contain high costs in terms of cultural capital and thus while being economically rational may represent an overall capital loss consequently the economic theories discussed above can be both right in the sense that a cost benefit analysis is the basis for decision making and wrong in the sense that they are simply not measuring the correct costs and benefits the loss of skills and knowledge also represents a loss of efficacy of action skills and knowledge built up over years or even generations of the same farming practices which would need to be replaced to reach the same level of competence and social standing as a good farmer in the new practices when all forms of capital are considered together changing enterprise or behaviour can represent a substantial loss of capital that is not directly economically measurable as a consequence compensating farmers only for the economic capital lost through agri environmental schemes is often not sufficient to engender behavioural change burton and paragahawewa 2011 despite the fact that studies exploring farmers cultural capital and concepts of good farming now comprise a substantial and well cited body of work few studies have attempted to measure farmers cultural capital or empirically explore how it might influence behaviour much of the work has been qualitative and focused on theoretical development and thus is difficult to translate into a policy environment where quantitative analysis of survey data or economic analysis are the preferred epistemologies nor does it assist quantitative economic models to better understand the contribution of non economic forms of capital to resolve this burton and paragahawewa 2011 suggest a number of ways in which cultural capital in its different forms institutionalised objectified and embodied can be measured however their paper did not provide the empirical test of the concept which the authors conceded is a critical next stage to the research p 102 this generates the two main questions that form the basis of this paper first are the quantitative ways of measuring cultural capital suggested by the authors effective and practical second if cultural capital can be measured does it actually influence farmer behaviour in the way it is theoretically supposed to do these are the issues we address in this paper the paper uses a study of irrigation behaviour in iran see yazdanpanah et al 2015 where a variety of different measures of behavioural influence were considered including cultural capital in order to explore the usefulness of cultural capital in understanding farmers behaviour based on the cultural capital framework eleven hypotheses are presented below h1 to h5 institutionalised cultural capital objectified cultural capital embodied cultural capital family experiences and farmer experience positively influence farmer intentions toward water conservation respectively h6 to h11 institutionalised cultural capital objectified cultural capital embodied cultural capital family experiences farmer experience and farmers intention positively influence farmer water conservation behavior respectively 3 methodology 3 1 participants and research site the research design involved a survey of farmers in the aleshtar county in lorestan province n 6000 in western iran see fig 2 based on table of sampling krejcie and morgan 1970 the research sample consisted of 360 growers data were collected through a face to face interview with farmers that took place in autumn 2013 each interview lasted about 40 min interviews with farmers took place in various locations including their farms homes or in other parts of the village the age of growers in the study ranged between 17 and 94 years with a mean age of 42 51 years s d 16 60 seventeen farmers 4 7 were women and 343 farmers were male 95 3 agriculture experience ranged between 1 and 85 years in agriculture with an average of 25 56 s d 18 62 in terms of education many of the participants 121 had a college degree 34 4 73 had a high school degree 67 were educated to primary level and 96 farmers had no formal education three growers did not respond to this the arable farm size of growers in the study ranged between 0 1 and 20 ha with a mean area of 2 94 ha while the rain fed farm size ranged between 0 16 and 21 ha with a mean area of 3 16 ha the sample was stratified to ensure that all available water source types and combinations of types were included namely spring fed 60 farmers irrigation canal 60 farmers and well 120 farmers well and irrigation canal 60 and well and spring 60 farmers in this region grew a variety of crops including wheat barley sugar beet and canola and vegetables tomatoes cucumbers beans in different seasons furthermore their main horticultural products were peaches apples and walnuts moreover the growers in the study used different irrigation techniques including traditional 275 farmers modern systems 34 farmers and a combination of both traditional and modern techniques 51 farmers 3 2 survey design as burton and paragahawewa 2011 observe the measurement of cultural capital has tended to focus on measures of highbrow cultural capital related to the arts or literature as many of the studies employing the concept focus around the issues of capital and social class based on bourdieu 1984 work distinction however they argue that these highbrow forms are not important within farming communities where cultural capital is predominantly in lowbrow forms developed through the practice of agriculture on their farms to obtain an overall estimate of cultural capital the three different forms of cultural capital institutionalised objectified and embodied were measured see above for definition of terms multiple items were established for the first time to quantify each of these aspects of capital framework regarding water conservation the scale for institutionalised cultural capital comprised 13 items alpha 0 88 directed at ascertaining whether the farmer had received formal recognition from credible institutions for their good management of water resources this could be either governmental e g water administrators educational or private organizations e g banks the second form of cultural capital objectified cultural capital comprised a series of 20 items alpha 0 93 relating to the possession of objects that symbolise effective water management in this case the items could refer either to the objects themselves e g new irrigation system the way they visually appeared where this symbolised efficacy in management e g well maintained equipment or clean ditches or quality of equipment relative to others e g being the first to buy new equipment alternatively objectified cultural capital could also be associated with the material outcome of the application of skill and knowledge in water management e g higher yields from irrigated fields or better prices for produce finally 5 measures of embodied cultural capital alpha 0 85 were applied which required farmers to directly assess their skill level in the operation of irrigation equipment in order to prevent farmers from simply stating they were good at everything the items were asked in a manner that made farmers consider their abilities relative to their other skills in agriculture e g skills in irrigation relative to their other skills in agriculture table 1 lists the categories recorded and provides examples of the types of items asked in addition to enable the development of the model of the effect of cultural capital on behavior measures were also taken of behavior 14 item scale alpha 0 87 and intended behavior 6 item scale alpha 0 76 behaviors selected were those that were best practice in terms of water conservation for example using cover around the plant roots irrigating at night or harvesting rainwater while intention to perform water conservation behaviors looked simply at general intentions to conserve in the future in applications of the widely used theory of planned behavior ajzen 1991 the model would include beliefs belief evaluations subjective norms subjective norm evaluations and perceived behavioral control instead of various different forms of cultural capital while it would clearly have been desirable to test the theories together this would have required a substantially larger questionnaire which was not possible under the financial constraints of the project here we are simply testing whether cultural capital and or the different forms of cultural capital are able to predict behavioral intention behavior to confirm that the items were appropriate measures of the desired constructs the different forms of cultural capital and behavioral indicators a draft version of the questionnaire was circulated to experts and questions adjusted according to their response items were scored on a 5 point scale using the endpoints depending on the question very low to very high strongly agree to strongly disagree and worst skill to best skill data from the questionnaire were analyzed using the spss statistical analysis program this involved firstly producing descriptive and frequency statistics for all variables secondly correlation tests were used to examine the association between all constructs finally we used structural equation modeling sem to determine which of the tested constructs were capable of predicting farmers intention and behavior regarding water conservation an additional factor included in the model see fig 1 was farmer and farm family experience measured in terms of the number of years in farming the reason for including experience is that this can also be considered a measure of embodied cultural capital in that the skills and knowledge embedded through formal educational practices can also be embedded through the repeated performance of an action non formal training this is particularly the case in farming communities for example atkins 2003 514 observed for a rural population that interviewees with a direct link to work in the agricultural and horticultural industry who described learning from their fathers and or other colleagues placed a great deal of value in non formal education in terms of the development of symbolic capital in our paper non formal education is counted as the number of years in farming or agriculture both for the family and the individual farmer ideally to reflect the development of particular skills and knowledge this would relate only directly to the relevant experience in irrigation activities however since this is difficult to ascertain and all farmers were dependent to some degree on irrigation we assumed that irrigation was an important part of experience based practice experience was not incorporated within the embodied cultural capital measure because the design of the embodied cultural capital measure a six point likert type self assessment of skills and knowledge was incompatible with the measure of experience years spent in agriculture 4 results a pearson correlation test was applied to examine the relationship between all constructs table 2 the results showed significant relationships between all forms of cultural capital and both intention to behave and behavior itself although as expected the relationship between cultural capital and intention to behave was stronger than that with behavior itself 4 1 main analysis structural equation modeling sem is regularly applied to examine possible relationships between variables in the research model sem is capable of calculating measurement error and can simultaneously estimate modeled path coefficients chen 2016 therefore in order to achieve the purpose of current study sem analysis was performed to investigate the explanatory power of the original and extended theory of planned behavior in predicting farmers intention to change rice crop to reduce water consumption the two stages of structural equation modeling include confirmatory factor analysis cfa to evaluate the suitability of the measurement model and then structural equation modeling anderson and gerbing 1988 based on the suggestion by anderson and gerbing 1988 a two step approach was applied the measurement model and structural model were constructed separately the measurement model provided a good fit to the data nfi 0 860 cfi 0 91 rmsea 0 055 aic 3635 29 confirmatory factor analysis was performed to evaluate the quality and suitability of the measurement model anderson and gerbing 1988 reliability convergent validity and discriminant validity were used for this purpose in the measurement model the reliability and internal consistency of the scales were confirmed with cronbach s alpha greater than 0 6 the t value of factor loadings is used to check for convergent validity when t value greater than 1 96 p 0 05 convergent validity was obtained discriminant validity indicates that the degree of correlation between constructs should be low for this purpose the square of the largest correlation coefficient between constructs should be less than the smallest average variance extracted ave therefore research constructs have discriminant and convergent validity 4 1 1 drivers of the intention and behavior regarding water conservation intention toward water conservation and water conservation behavior were selected as the dependent variables while the various types of capital in cultural capital framework including family farmer experience as an embodied cultural capital measure were entered into the sem as independent variables fig 3 path relationships from sem revealed that the embodied cultural capital and objective cultural capital have positive impact on the intention h2 and h3 confirmed both of these constructs in sum predicted about 43 of the variance in farmers intention embodied cultural capital was most predictive β 0 41 p 0 0001 followed by objective cultural capital β 0 45 p 0 013 furthermore path relationships revealed that the institutionalised cultural capital objective cultural capital intention and family experiences have positive impact on the behavior h6 h7 h9 and h11 confirmed in sum these same factors predicted about 45 of the variance in farmers behavior objective cultural capital predictive β 0 45 p 0 004 and intention β 0 45 p 0 004 were most followed by institutionalised cultural capital β 0 25 p 0 009 and family experiences β 0 11 p 0 040 regarding indirect effects sem revealed that overall the fit statistics support the criterion validity and explanatory power of the cultural capital furthermore sem analysis showed that objective cultural capital 0 22 and embodied cultural capital 0 23 have an indirect effect on behaviour through intention 5 discussion the aim of this study was to examine the intention and behavior of water conservation of farmers in a region in western iran to this end we have used a theoretical framework which is considered more qualitative and rarely quantified the name cultural capital theory was coined by french philosopher bourdieu to interpret the results of this research and the theory we will look at the results from two perspectives first we will analyse variables that affect growers intention and behavior regarding water conservation second we take the point of view of the power and the prediction capacity of the model with comparison with existing theories due to this model rarely being quantified this provides an important contribution in improving literature in this area regarding the first perspective sem analysis revealed that the embodied cultural capital and objective cultural capital predicted about 43 of the variance in farmers intention and other variables do not have a significant effect on intention that the two measures of embodied cultural capital both appear to influence intentions suggests that capital stored corporeally as learned knowledge and skill through an extended socialisation process may play an important role in determining intended irrigation outcomes therefore time invested in developing good practice is reflected in good future intentions furthermore path relationships revealed that the institutionalised cultural capital objective cultural capital intention and family experiences predicted about 45 of the variance in farmers behavior a previous model suggested that there is a relationship between the belief about one s efficacy and abilities in water conservation activities and intention to perform conservation behaviors yazdanpanah et al 2014 however this model suggests belief in abilities and skills does not necessarily translate into actual behavior the connection between objectified cultural capital and the efficient running of equipment e g good maintenance of irrigation systems using modern equipment suggests that objectified cultural capital may be having a control effect on intended behaviour i e it is easier to practice water conservation with well maintained equipment this is likely to reflect the fact that the objects that generate cultural capital are in many cases also those with the practical utility that allows the behaviours to be performed for example modern irrigation systems objectified cultural capital make monitoring of the irrigation easier and or are likely to include covers for the canals however it is unlikely that this relationship is entirely structural the stronger connection between objectified cultural capital and behavior itself reflects the same role perceived behavioral control has in the tpb model i e the intention to apply skills and knowledge is being moderated by the equipment available to carry out the intention as embodied cultural capital self reported skills and knowledge showed the strongest relationship with intention to behave there is clearly a connection between the performance of good water conservation and perceived knowledge skills concerning how to behave when individuals operate within a context that contains historically developed formal cultural capital institutional objects and systems of object production that generate cultural capital objectified and have incorporated knowledge and skills corporeally over their lifespans embodied this existing capital appears likely to continue to dominate their behavior in the short term any educational measures that suggest behaviors contrary to the existing systems of capital i e that fail to generate or even compromise the generation of symbolic capital status peer esteem are likely to be difficult to implement in the short term more targeted investigation of the role of education within the pantheon of other cultural capital forms could be useful to explore these notions regarding the second perspective our analysis revealed that cultural capital could predict about 43 of the variance in farmers intention and 45 of the variance in farmers behavior while with the same sample and intention and behavior measure theory of planned behavior predicted 43 and 46 of the variance in farmers intention and behavior respectively rahimi et al 2017 social cognitive theory predicted 43 and 46 of the variance in farmers intention and behavior respectively yazdanpanah et al 2015 norm activation model predicted 49 of the variance in farmers behavior and social capital predicted 45 and 47 of the variance in farmers intention and behavior respectively rahimi et al 2016 furthermore in their meta analysis armitage and conner 2001 found that the average explained variance of intention and behavior applying the theory of planned behavior and the theory of reasoned action was about 39 and 27 respectively therefore in appraisal with past literature regarding the prediction capacity of the cultural model our result is satisfactory and current result showed that the cultural capital was equally good at illumination growers willingness and behavior it is important to note that it is the first time this model has been quantified furthermore cultural capital is a european model being carried out for the first time in an islamic iranian culture context therefore the model needs greater elaboration with respect to quantification and the new context the current research can shed more light on that model but within a new cultural context the results of this study suggest that cultural capital could be a serious competitor to the current behavioral models in environmental behavior and is worth pursuing further here we have illustrated that bourdieu s capitals approach appears to have some utility for understanding behavioral choices in agriculture however as the first study of its kind there are a number of issues that need to be addressed in future research first this has only been a partial application of the notion of capital while here we have simplified the study by focusing on cultural capital alone because it forms the core of the habitus and has been the focus of previous qualitative studies of farmer behavior within bourdieu s framework social capital and economic capital are additional areas in which capital can be stored and exchanged thus in order to assess total capital a means of integrating these forms of capital into the model is also required it would be interesting to see whether the incorporation of cultural and social capital into economic models focusing on economic capital improves the predictive ability of economic models second we have applied the theory here to a very specific aspect of farmer behavior farmer s irrigation behavior we are not able to assess whether this constitutes a specific case or if the lessons learned here have generic implications for farming behaviors this requires further investigation through applying the approach to a wider range of issues third as a cultural theory we need to develop a greater understanding of how it applies in cultural contexts outside of iran we have already noted that the theoretical framework based on cultural capital was developed in a western context the fact that it also functions in iran suggests that the concept may be able to be applied generically but we are still in need of studies in a range of different cultural contexts fourth there is the issue of overlapping constructs more theoretical development is required here for example as we note earlier the concept of cultural capital and habitus lay out a cultural framework within which deliberative decisions are taken but understanding how and when cultural frameworks rather than cognitive decision making frameworks are better for understanding farmer behavior requires further work the possibility exists of combining socio psychological models with a cultural approach into a hybrid model but that was not within the scope of our study perhaps the most important issue is the need to separate the influence of the cultural importance of the variables measured here from their influence over utility as noted earlier objects on the farm such as a new irrigation machine only provide cultural capital when others within the peer community interpret it as culturally symbolic the object in itself does not necessarily provide cultural capital however the objects that provide cultural capital in the case of agriculture generally do so because they are also of great practical utility this raises the question of whether measures of objective cultural capital in our case the best predictor of intended behavior and behavior are measuring cultural capital enhanced control beliefs or both in our study we based the assessment on theory however it may be possible in future studies to assess the cultural relevance of objects skills knowledge and so on in a pre test in terms of its use for policy the case has already been made by burton and paragahawewa 2011 that being able to measure and understand cultural capital would enable policy makers to incorporate loss of cultural capital when considering compensation rates for schemes designed to change behavior prior to this study there have been a lack of empirical studies on both how to implement measures of cultural capital and indeed whether such measures would have any behavioral implications we now cautiously suggest that it is possible to develop quantitative measures of cultural capital and that these measures indeed have implications for farmers behavioral choices 6 conclusion the aim of this study was to examine the intention and behavior of water conservation of farmers in a region in western iran to this end we have used a theoretical framework which is considered more qualitative and rarely quantified cultural capital theory was coined by french philosopher bourdieu analysis revealed that the embodied cultural capital and objective cultural capital predicted have significant effect on intention furthermore path relationships revealed that the institutionalised cultural capital objective cultural capital intention and family experiences predicted farmers behavior moreover in appraisal with past literature regarding the prediction capacity of the cultural model our result is satisfactory and current results showed that the cultural capital was equally good at illuminating growers willingness and

5089,the objective of this paper is to empirically test the explanatory ability of cultural capital which is generally considered more qualitatively and rarely quantified for farmers water conservation behavior in applying this approach we reflect the growing interest in the role of culture and identity in influencing farmer s decision making the study design involved a cross sectional survey of growers in the aleshtar county in western iran the sample consisted of 360 farmers the results of person correlation test showed significant relationships between all forms of cultural capital and both intention to behave and behavior furthermore structural equation model analysis revealed that the embodied and objective forms of capital predicted about 43 of the variance in farmers intention moreover the institutionalised objective intension and family experiences predicted about 45 of the variance in farmers behavior based on the research results recommendations for water conservation were provided keywords water conservation embodied cultural capital objective cultural capital institutionalised cultural capital farmer behavior 1 introduction achieving and maintaining food security has always been a top priority internationally due to national welfare and political stability concerns del ninno et al 2007 however the current widespread nature of food and nutrition security problems pimentel and pimentel 2007 nooghabi et al 2018 and a rapidly rising global population fao 2003 give cause for concern about the growing insecurity of world food supplies and the vulnerability of human health and productivity pimentel and pimentel 2007 nooghabi et al 2018 these concerns are exacerbated by a range of factors including war conflict soil degradation economic crises climate change urbanization industrialization intellectual property issues income and consumption growth changes in lifestyle food price fluctuations and turbulence in global energy and food markets khan et al 2009 allouche 2011 yazdanpanah et al 2013b azadi et al 2019a boazar et al 2019 aliabadi et al 2020 delfiyan et al 2020 increasing emphasis in western countries on the development of a bioeconomy oecd 2009 where agricultural land can potentially be used to produce biomass feedstock for industry may add further pressure as is already occurring with the conversion of food products to fuels khan et al 2009 while there are many different components to this crisis the production of food remains both the underlying goal and when enhanced the solution and instrument for many countries in dryer regions of the world which are experiencing some of the greatest population growth the main problem continues to be access to water the key driver of agricultural production hanjra and qureshi 2010 for example in cases such as southern india over extraction of water and failure of adequate replenishment is resulting in widespread and alarming falls in the water table ferrant et al 2014 iranian farmers have similarly viewed water tables drop wells have dried up and previously productive lands being enforced out of productive use hayati et al 2010 tajeri moghadam et al 2020 shojaei miandoragh et al 2019 this scarcity of water is becoming increasingly closely linked to the issue of food security falkenmark 2001 pakmehr et al 2020b it has been estimated that in the near future nearly half of the earth s inhabitants will unable to mobilize the water needed to guarantee food self sufficiency kummu et al 2014 consequently there is an urgent need to understand the management of water resources with the focus on encouraging the agricultural sector to use less water while maintaining or enhancing the quantity and quality of food produced farmers utilization of water resources is at the center of this focus in iran a recent water crisis has caused the government to make a transition from its traditional water management approach supply side driven to a more demand driven approach yazdanpanah et al 2013a veisi et al 2020 kazemi et al 2018 nasrabadi et al 2013 as a consumer of 90 to 93 of water resources tatar et al 2019 the agricultural sector has become the main goal for new initiatives from a demand approach such as water conservation activities valizadeh et al 2019 hence the main question for policy makers is how to motivate individual farmers to apply the water conservation activities that are vital for the success of any water management policy pakmehr et al 2020a due to low and centrally subsidized prices for agricultural water irrigation has not been used very efficiently in the past rezadoost and allahyari 2014 boazar et al 2020 mohammadinezhad and ahmadvand 2020 consequently any attempt to introduce voluntary measures to improve individuals water usage necessitates first knowledge of those present activities and second a knowledge of how those activities can be transformed yazdanpanah et al 2014 the objective of this paper is to empirically test the influence of cultural capital on farmers water conservation behavior this reflects a growing interest in the importance of culture and self identity to understandfarmers behavior wilson et al 2013 lokhorst et al 2014 the paper is divided into four sections first we review theories of farmer behavior to establish a theoretical basis of the research second we present the methodology employed in the study third we use regression analysis to explore the role of the different components of cultural capital objectified embodied institutionalized in contributing to water conservation behavior finally we discuss the results in particular analyzing a the potential for using components of cultural capital in models of farmers behavior and b the implications of understanding the cultural capital behavior link for the promotion of water conservation in iran and countries with similar water issues 2 understanding farmer s water conservation behaviour the case for a capitals approach current global moves towards more neoliberal forms of governance pushed by globalisation and trade agreements and their emphasis on voluntary action combined with growing concern for environmental and food security issues mean that at the same time as needing to change individual behaviour regulation is decreasingly seen as the solution this places a high importance on understanding how to induce voluntary behavioural change however understanding human behaviour is an extremely complex and difficult task ajzen 1991 janssen and jager 2000 it has been approached from many different angles ranging from the perspective of economic rationality at one extreme to a focus on understanding the influence of socio psychological factors at the other with the entire spectrum of approaches contributing to the development of policies to promote behavioural change collier et al 2010 in this sector we present the theoretical case for an additional perspective that of cultural capital as a means of better understanding farmer behaviour the section begins by discussing short comings with the two most commonly applied frameworks jackson 2005 rational economic models rems and attitude behavioural models abms see rolls 2001 jackson 2005 collier et al 2010 and then briefly outlines why incorporating the concept of cultural capital could address some of the shortcomings of existing approaches 2 1 the rational economic model rem and behavioural change economics at the microeconomic level neoclassical economics is essentially about how people make decisions and take choices and offers powerful tools to change behaviour which are utilised often and effectively by government collier et al 2010 the rational economic model is grounded on the key premises that individual preferences provide the foundation for all human activity and rational activity is the result of cognitive deliberation hassell and cary 2007 consequently decisions are related to an internalised cost benefit assessment with the behaviour chosen being the one that maximizes the expected net benefit hassell and cary 2007 pearce et al 2007 jarrett 2015 a number of assumptions are made in the model the most important ones being that a a sovereign individual also called an actor or economic agent has preferences that can be represented by a utility function and b that the individual possesses perfect information or searches optimally and behaves consistently according to stable preferences folmer 2009 for achieving pro environmental choices rem is dependent on a defined set of conditions being met perfect information and perfect competition collier et al 2010 the rem model is commonly used to construct tools for policy makers jackson 2005 and shapes government policies in areas such as taxation and subsidies see vugt 2001 campbell et al 2004 despite widespread use of the rem model the rem s many axioms and assumptions have been heavily criticised on the basis that they are too rigorous and lead to far reaching abstractions from reality which in turn means they have inadequate descriptive and analytical power rol 2008 many authors from the field of ecological economics have stated an uneasiness with the neoclassical behavioural model with some even suggesting that it is partly responsible for setting the wrong agenda for environmental policy making costanza et al 1991 gardner and stern 2002 jackson 2005 also distinguishes that private choices do not always take account of social costs or wider environmental interests he adds that a degree of routine enters our behaviour making it much more difficult to change and undermining a key assumption of the rational choice model jarrett 2015 jackson 2005 gardner and stern 2002 furthermore the rem does not adequately acknowledge the limits on an individual s capability to take deliberative actions and the manner in which people respond to affective or emotional influences hassell and cary 2007 in sum literature on individual decisions and adoption of change have revealed that monetary models have been incapable to explain how individuals actually make choices slovic et al 1977 simon 1978 gardner and stern 2002 jarrett 2015 yazdanpanah et al 2016 the theoretical short comings of the rem can have real effects on policy outcomes for example by creating economic motivations for actions that were previously motivated by normative factors behavioural change under this model can lead to the so called economization of society bovenberg van de klundert 2006 cited in folmer 2009 where previously intrinsically motivated behaviours become financially motivated see deci and ryan 2002 this crowding out effect of non self interested and non monetary stimulus by economic motivations has been recognised since the 1970s de snoo et al 2013 furthermore promoting behavioural change through financial incentives can have negative effects in that people often revert to old ways when incentives end or regulations are no longer enforced and so long term protection may be compromised pretty 2003 1914 thus although decision makers tend to place high expectations on agri environment contracts as an instrument to control environmental externalities such payments usually miscarry to bring about long lasting variations in behaviours de snoo et al 2013 2 2 non economic attitudinal models and behavioural change to address failings in the rem approach non economic perspectives are increasingly being applied to understand farmer s behaviour and behavioural change azadi et al 2019b of these the dominant approach involves attempting to understand and change the attitudes that farmers hold towards any particular policy objective both in terms of strict quantitative models and more qualitative approaches e g the behavioural approach morris and potter 1995 attitudes are universally accepted as playing a key role in determining behaviour this has not always been the case prior to the mid 1970s the relationship between attitude and behaviour was believed to be unreliable and it was only with the development of the theory of reasoned action tra fishbein and ajzen 1975 that the significance of attitude was finally confirmed the key to the success of this model was the inclusion of subjective norms the influence of significant others along with the introduction of intended behaviour as an intermediary construct between attitudes and behaviours in the following decades researchers found a number of additional constructs that could contribute significantly to behaviour in particular self efficacy habit moral obligation and self identity further refinements were made by ajzen 1985 ajzen 1991 with the inclusion of perceived behavioural control a self efficacy construct into the renamed theory of planned behaviour tpb it is this model that now dominates literature into the relationship between attitudes and behaviour attitudinal perspectives on behaviour increased significantly in importance with the introduction of voluntary environmental programs in the european union under article 19 of the farm structures regulations in 1987 and later the mcsharry reforms of 1992 which saw the widespread implementation of agri environment measures aems low uptake of payment schemes in the early stages of implementation prompted a dramatic increase in interest in non economic motivational factors and resulted in numerous studies looking at farmers attitudes towards the environment e g austin et al 1998 while some studies applied behavioural models directly from social psychology carr and tait 1990 beedell and rehman 1999 the majority of studies followed a more general behavioural approach where attitudes were measured but information about the structural condition of the farm including the economic position was also gathered to help explain the influence of structural conditions e g morris and potter 1995 while the measurement of attitudes adds an important additional perspective to rem approaches a number of recent studies have suggested that the relationship between farmers environmental attitudes and environmental behaviour is weak e g hassell and cary 2007 the reason for this is uncertain on the one hand many of the behavioural approach models fail to adhere to the strict conditions for the model to function as laid out in the social psychology literature for example by simplifying attitude questions not measuring the expectations attached to the attitudes leaving out measures of subjective norm using single items to measure attitudes rather than multi item scales and so on on the other hand the application of strict models is also problematic for example beedell and rehman 2000 126 found from their application of the tpb model to farmers environmental behaviour that the process was very time consuming with the precise nature of question wording required making the process appear contorted to the respondents this need to focus on the model also meant their study was unable to consider the multitude of structural and historical factors known to have a significant impact on farmer s behaviour such as the effect of farm development or farmer life cycles on landscape change however the cause of the weak relationships may also be that the connection between environmental attitudes and behaviour is genuinely poor one possible reason for this is that the notion of a predictable and therefore targetable link between attitudes and behaviour is predicated on the belief that an individual can only hold a single attitude at a particular time if individuals hold multiple attitudes simultaneously behaviour will be dependent not on attitude but which attitude is expressed and thus what determines the expression of attitude one example of this is the dual attitude theory this postulates that individuals can hold two attitudes to the same object in the same context simultaneously the result of an old attitude being replaced by a new one but where one is implicit or habitual and lies outside of the person s awareness whereas the other is explicit and where the expression can be consciously controlled wilson et al 2000 another theory suggests that self identity is comprised of multiple and hierarchal identities with each identity holding an internalised understanding of the significance of attitudes and behaviours of the particular peer group stryker 1980 as identities become salient due to contextual triggers e g entering a religious place so the attitudes and behaviours associated with the salient identity will become prevalent rather than attitude behaviour being consistent across all identities and contexts see burton and wilson 2006 2 3 the behavioural influence of cultural capital while economic capital forms the single basis of our economic behavioural models cultural and social capital as forms of accumulated labour in the context of agricultural production have received very limited attention in the literature however since the 1970s studies have illustrated that economic capital alone does not motivate farmers behaviour research by gasson 1973 for example illustrated that farmers main goals were intrinsically rather than economically motivated with the main reasons for farming being associated with enjoying the job and being able to make independent decisions in another example coughenour 1976 found that many sheep farmers wool growers in australia were not making the then economically rational decision to convert from sheep to beef farming because they were embedded within a community of sheep farmers that provided them with prestige and social approval conversion to cattle would result in cessation of the activities and interactions associated with sheep farming which in turn would result in a loss of these non economic forms of capital coughenour used homans 1974 social exchange theory this acted as a disincentive to behavioural change even when if economic capital alone was considered the decision to convert was entirely rational the possibility that non economic forms of capital may influence farmers decision making has recently been raised in a body of literature that focuses on the role of cultural capital in behavioural choice see burton and paragahawewa 2011 sutherland and burton 2011 burton 2012 riley 2016 this work applies the capitals theoretical framework of french sociologist pierre bourdieu see bourdieu 1986 to understand farmer s resistance to change bourdieu s key premise was that economic capital has become the focus of our understanding of capital only because of its unambiguous immediacy and the transparency of economic exchanges and that this has led to the neglect of other forms of accumulated labour he suggests that capital exists in three fundamental forms economic capital investments in resources as material property social capital investments in resources that can be mobilised via social connections and mutual obligations and cultural capital investments in knowledge skills dispositions recognition from culturally relevant organisations and possession of culturally significant objects cultural capital is said to exist in three forms namely institutionalised qualifications or recognition from official institutions that effectively provide certificates of cultural competence e g best in show awards agricultural qualifications objectified capital incorporated in material objects of high status value e g a new tractor or a well tended tidy field burton 2012 and embodied capital present as learned skills knowledge dispositions sensibilities and so on e g when to plough how to drive a tractor shared cultural perspectives on agriculture in addition bourdieu contends that capital transfers between the main forms through symbolic capital status prestige and reputation such that for example economic capital can be exchanged for cultural capital through investment in education and in turn cultural capital education provides access to both economic and social capital it is important to note that knowledge skill qualifications and material objects alone do not necessarily provide symbolic capital but it is when this knowledge is culturally relevant i e represents a source of prestige or status that it has implications beyond simple efficacy see bourdieu 1986 it can also be used to generate social capital in particular embodied cultural capital inculcates within individuals the dispositions and manners that facilitate the types of appropriate sociability which allow the alchemy of consecration to transform contingent relationships into relations of mutual obligation holt 2008 p 232 in other words cultural capital can be used for the purpose of establishing or reproducing social relationships that are directly usable in the short or long term bourdieu 1986 p 52 possessing the relevant embodied cultural capital enables one to act consciously or subconsciously in appropriate ways within social networks and makes the inclusion of the individual within social networks desirable to be accepted within a peer group you must have relevant cultural capital and in the case of farmers there is evidence that embodied cultural capital in the form of skills and knowledge in agriculture is critical for acceptance within the community as a good farmer burton et al 2008 2020 a key part of how cultural capital guides behaviour and therefore how it differs from attitudinal based approaches lies in its connection with what bourdieu terms habitus a socialised body a structured body a body which has incorporated the immanent structures of a world or of a particular sector of that world a field and which structures the perception of that world as well as action within that world bourdieu 1998 p 81 thus the actor s habitus composed of the generic transposable characteristics that represent the cultural capital of the individual holt 1997 combines social and structural elements into a body that possesses a subconscious framework for operating within their world through socialisation there is a strong historical aspect to the concept with habitus being passed through families from generation to generation bourdieu is clear that while the habitus offers a subconscious route that disposes the individual towards culturally determined courses of action it does not exclude deliberative behaviour he notes it is of course never ruled out that the responses of the habitus may be accompanied by a strategic calculation tending to perform in a conscious mode the operation that the habitus performs quite differently but these responses are first defined without any calculation in relation to objective potentialities immediately inscribed in the present things to do or not to do things to say or not to say bourdeiu 1990 p 53 cultural capital thus lays out a set of cultural rules within which deliberative decisions are made in this sense habitus is not equated with habit as sometimes measured in the tpb further while objectified institutional and embodied cultural forms of capital have some similarities with aspects measured in the tpb e g new or large machinery is likely to simultaneously generate objectified cultural capital and increase perceived behavioural control the overall cultural capital framework measures the influence of the embedded cultural part of decision making i e not directly measurable in psychometric surveys as a socialised cultural construct cultural capital is likely to be more important in communities with strong social ties in the case of agriculture which generally still involves communities of family farmers that have been on the same farm and worked together for generations if not centuries we contend that cultural capital and the habitus play a particularly important role in structuring behavioural choice a framework based on cultural capital also builds on the economic approaches to decision making bourdieu 1986 criticises economic approaches to capital as reducing the universe of exchanges to mercantile exchange whereas in reality exchange is also present in the immaterial forms of social and cultural capital a cultural capital approach to understanding behaviour proposes that the economically most viable option can contain high costs in terms of cultural capital and thus while being economically rational may represent an overall capital loss consequently the economic theories discussed above can be both right in the sense that a cost benefit analysis is the basis for decision making and wrong in the sense that they are simply not measuring the correct costs and benefits the loss of skills and knowledge also represents a loss of efficacy of action skills and knowledge built up over years or even generations of the same farming practices which would need to be replaced to reach the same level of competence and social standing as a good farmer in the new practices when all forms of capital are considered together changing enterprise or behaviour can represent a substantial loss of capital that is not directly economically measurable as a consequence compensating farmers only for the economic capital lost through agri environmental schemes is often not sufficient to engender behavioural change burton and paragahawewa 2011 despite the fact that studies exploring farmers cultural capital and concepts of good farming now comprise a substantial and well cited body of work few studies have attempted to measure farmers cultural capital or empirically explore how it might influence behaviour much of the work has been qualitative and focused on theoretical development and thus is difficult to translate into a policy environment where quantitative analysis of survey data or economic analysis are the preferred epistemologies nor does it assist quantitative economic models to better understand the contribution of non economic forms of capital to resolve this burton and paragahawewa 2011 suggest a number of ways in which cultural capital in its different forms institutionalised objectified and embodied can be measured however their paper did not provide the empirical test of the concept which the authors conceded is a critical next stage to the research p 102 this generates the two main questions that form the basis of this paper first are the quantitative ways of measuring cultural capital suggested by the authors effective and practical second if cultural capital can be measured does it actually influence farmer behaviour in the way it is theoretically supposed to do these are the issues we address in this paper the paper uses a study of irrigation behaviour in iran see yazdanpanah et al 2015 where a variety of different measures of behavioural influence were considered including cultural capital in order to explore the usefulness of cultural capital in understanding farmers behaviour based on the cultural capital framework eleven hypotheses are presented below h1 to h5 institutionalised cultural capital objectified cultural capital embodied cultural capital family experiences and farmer experience positively influence farmer intentions toward water conservation respectively h6 to h11 institutionalised cultural capital objectified cultural capital embodied cultural capital family experiences farmer experience and farmers intention positively influence farmer water conservation behavior respectively 3 methodology 3 1 participants and research site the research design involved a survey of farmers in the aleshtar county in lorestan province n 6000 in western iran see fig 2 based on table of sampling krejcie and morgan 1970 the research sample consisted of 360 growers data were collected through a face to face interview with farmers that took place in autumn 2013 each interview lasted about 40 min interviews with farmers took place in various locations including their farms homes or in other parts of the village the age of growers in the study ranged between 17 and 94 years with a mean age of 42 51 years s d 16 60 seventeen farmers 4 7 were women and 343 farmers were male 95 3 agriculture experience ranged between 1 and 85 years in agriculture with an average of 25 56 s d 18 62 in terms of education many of the participants 121 had a college degree 34 4 73 had a high school degree 67 were educated to primary level and 96 farmers had no formal education three growers did not respond to this the arable farm size of growers in the study ranged between 0 1 and 20 ha with a mean area of 2 94 ha while the rain fed farm size ranged between 0 16 and 21 ha with a mean area of 3 16 ha the sample was stratified to ensure that all available water source types and combinations of types were included namely spring fed 60 farmers irrigation canal 60 farmers and well 120 farmers well and irrigation canal 60 and well and spring 60 farmers in this region grew a variety of crops including wheat barley sugar beet and canola and vegetables tomatoes cucumbers beans in different seasons furthermore their main horticultural products were peaches apples and walnuts moreover the growers in the study used different irrigation techniques including traditional 275 farmers modern systems 34 farmers and a combination of both traditional and modern techniques 51 farmers 3 2 survey design as burton and paragahawewa 2011 observe the measurement of cultural capital has tended to focus on measures of highbrow cultural capital related to the arts or literature as many of the studies employing the concept focus around the issues of capital and social class based on bourdieu 1984 work distinction however they argue that these highbrow forms are not important within farming communities where cultural capital is predominantly in lowbrow forms developed through the practice of agriculture on their farms to obtain an overall estimate of cultural capital the three different forms of cultural capital institutionalised objectified and embodied were measured see above for definition of terms multiple items were established for the first time to quantify each of these aspects of capital framework regarding water conservation the scale for institutionalised cultural capital comprised 13 items alpha 0 88 directed at ascertaining whether the farmer had received formal recognition from credible institutions for their good management of water resources this could be either governmental e g water administrators educational or private organizations e g banks the second form of cultural capital objectified cultural capital comprised a series of 20 items alpha 0 93 relating to the possession of objects that symbolise effective water management in this case the items could refer either to the objects themselves e g new irrigation system the way they visually appeared where this symbolised efficacy in management e g well maintained equipment or clean ditches or quality of equipment relative to others e g being the first to buy new equipment alternatively objectified cultural capital could also be associated with the material outcome of the application of skill and knowledge in water management e g higher yields from irrigated fields or better prices for produce finally 5 measures of embodied cultural capital alpha 0 85 were applied which required farmers to directly assess their skill level in the operation of irrigation equipment in order to prevent farmers from simply stating they were good at everything the items were asked in a manner that made farmers consider their abilities relative to their other skills in agriculture e g skills in irrigation relative to their other skills in agriculture table 1 lists the categories recorded and provides examples of the types of items asked in addition to enable the development of the model of the effect of cultural capital on behavior measures were also taken of behavior 14 item scale alpha 0 87 and intended behavior 6 item scale alpha 0 76 behaviors selected were those that were best practice in terms of water conservation for example using cover around the plant roots irrigating at night or harvesting rainwater while intention to perform water conservation behaviors looked simply at general intentions to conserve in the future in applications of the widely used theory of planned behavior ajzen 1991 the model would include beliefs belief evaluations subjective norms subjective norm evaluations and perceived behavioral control instead of various different forms of cultural capital while it would clearly have been desirable to test the theories together this would have required a substantially larger questionnaire which was not possible under the financial constraints of the project here we are simply testing whether cultural capital and or the different forms of cultural capital are able to predict behavioral intention behavior to confirm that the items were appropriate measures of the desired constructs the different forms of cultural capital and behavioral indicators a draft version of the questionnaire was circulated to experts and questions adjusted according to their response items were scored on a 5 point scale using the endpoints depending on the question very low to very high strongly agree to strongly disagree and worst skill to best skill data from the questionnaire were analyzed using the spss statistical analysis program this involved firstly producing descriptive and frequency statistics for all variables secondly correlation tests were used to examine the association between all constructs finally we used structural equation modeling sem to determine which of the tested constructs were capable of predicting farmers intention and behavior regarding water conservation an additional factor included in the model see fig 1 was farmer and farm family experience measured in terms of the number of years in farming the reason for including experience is that this can also be considered a measure of embodied cultural capital in that the skills and knowledge embedded through formal educational practices can also be embedded through the repeated performance of an action non formal training this is particularly the case in farming communities for example atkins 2003 514 observed for a rural population that interviewees with a direct link to work in the agricultural and horticultural industry who described learning from their fathers and or other colleagues placed a great deal of value in non formal education in terms of the development of symbolic capital in our paper non formal education is counted as the number of years in farming or agriculture both for the family and the individual farmer ideally to reflect the development of particular skills and knowledge this would relate only directly to the relevant experience in irrigation activities however since this is difficult to ascertain and all farmers were dependent to some degree on irrigation we assumed that irrigation was an important part of experience based practice experience was not incorporated within the embodied cultural capital measure because the design of the embodied cultural capital measure a six point likert type self assessment of skills and knowledge was incompatible with the measure of experience years spent in agriculture 4 results a pearson correlation test was applied to examine the relationship between all constructs table 2 the results showed significant relationships between all forms of cultural capital and both intention to behave and behavior itself although as expected the relationship between cultural capital and intention to behave was stronger than that with behavior itself 4 1 main analysis structural equation modeling sem is regularly applied to examine possible relationships between variables in the research model sem is capable of calculating measurement error and can simultaneously estimate modeled path coefficients chen 2016 therefore in order to achieve the purpose of current study sem analysis was performed to investigate the explanatory power of the original and extended theory of planned behavior in predicting farmers intention to change rice crop to reduce water consumption the two stages of structural equation modeling include confirmatory factor analysis cfa to evaluate the suitability of the measurement model and then structural equation modeling anderson and gerbing 1988 based on the suggestion by anderson and gerbing 1988 a two step approach was applied the measurement model and structural model were constructed separately the measurement model provided a good fit to the data nfi 0 860 cfi 0 91 rmsea 0 055 aic 3635 29 confirmatory factor analysis was performed to evaluate the quality and suitability of the measurement model anderson and gerbing 1988 reliability convergent validity and discriminant validity were used for this purpose in the measurement model the reliability and internal consistency of the scales were confirmed with cronbach s alpha greater than 0 6 the t value of factor loadings is used to check for convergent validity when t value greater than 1 96 p 0 05 convergent validity was obtained discriminant validity indicates that the degree of correlation between constructs should be low for this purpose the square of the largest correlation coefficient between constructs should be less than the smallest average variance extracted ave therefore research constructs have discriminant and convergent validity 4 1 1 drivers of the intention and behavior regarding water conservation intention toward water conservation and water conservation behavior were selected as the dependent variables while the various types of capital in cultural capital framework including family farmer experience as an embodied cultural capital measure were entered into the sem as independent variables fig 3 path relationships from sem revealed that the embodied cultural capital and objective cultural capital have positive impact on the intention h2 and h3 confirmed both of these constructs in sum predicted about 43 of the variance in farmers intention embodied cultural capital was most predictive β 0 41 p 0 0001 followed by objective cultural capital β 0 45 p 0 013 furthermore path relationships revealed that the institutionalised cultural capital objective cultural capital intention and family experiences have positive impact on the behavior h6 h7 h9 and h11 confirmed in sum these same factors predicted about 45 of the variance in farmers behavior objective cultural capital predictive β 0 45 p 0 004 and intention β 0 45 p 0 004 were most followed by institutionalised cultural capital β 0 25 p 0 009 and family experiences β 0 11 p 0 040 regarding indirect effects sem revealed that overall the fit statistics support the criterion validity and explanatory power of the cultural capital furthermore sem analysis showed that objective cultural capital 0 22 and embodied cultural capital 0 23 have an indirect effect on behaviour through intention 5 discussion the aim of this study was to examine the intention and behavior of water conservation of farmers in a region in western iran to this end we have used a theoretical framework which is considered more qualitative and rarely quantified the name cultural capital theory was coined by french philosopher bourdieu to interpret the results of this research and the theory we will look at the results from two perspectives first we will analyse variables that affect growers intention and behavior regarding water conservation second we take the point of view of the power and the prediction capacity of the model with comparison with existing theories due to this model rarely being quantified this provides an important contribution in improving literature in this area regarding the first perspective sem analysis revealed that the embodied cultural capital and objective cultural capital predicted about 43 of the variance in farmers intention and other variables do not have a significant effect on intention that the two measures of embodied cultural capital both appear to influence intentions suggests that capital stored corporeally as learned knowledge and skill through an extended socialisation process may play an important role in determining intended irrigation outcomes therefore time invested in developing good practice is reflected in good future intentions furthermore path relationships revealed that the institutionalised cultural capital objective cultural capital intention and family experiences predicted about 45 of the variance in farmers behavior a previous model suggested that there is a relationship between the belief about one s efficacy and abilities in water conservation activities and intention to perform conservation behaviors yazdanpanah et al 2014 however this model suggests belief in abilities and skills does not necessarily translate into actual behavior the connection between objectified cultural capital and the efficient running of equipment e g good maintenance of irrigation systems using modern equipment suggests that objectified cultural capital may be having a control effect on intended behaviour i e it is easier to practice water conservation with well maintained equipment this is likely to reflect the fact that the objects that generate cultural capital are in many cases also those with the practical utility that allows the behaviours to be performed for example modern irrigation systems objectified cultural capital make monitoring of the irrigation easier and or are likely to include covers for the canals however it is unlikely that this relationship is entirely structural the stronger connection between objectified cultural capital and behavior itself reflects the same role perceived behavioral control has in the tpb model i e the intention to apply skills and knowledge is being moderated by the equipment available to carry out the intention as embodied cultural capital self reported skills and knowledge showed the strongest relationship with intention to behave there is clearly a connection between the performance of good water conservation and perceived knowledge skills concerning how to behave when individuals operate within a context that contains historically developed formal cultural capital institutional objects and systems of object production that generate cultural capital objectified and have incorporated knowledge and skills corporeally over their lifespans embodied this existing capital appears likely to continue to dominate their behavior in the short term any educational measures that suggest behaviors contrary to the existing systems of capital i e that fail to generate or even compromise the generation of symbolic capital status peer esteem are likely to be difficult to implement in the short term more targeted investigation of the role of education within the pantheon of other cultural capital forms could be useful to explore these notions regarding the second perspective our analysis revealed that cultural capital could predict about 43 of the variance in farmers intention and 45 of the variance in farmers behavior while with the same sample and intention and behavior measure theory of planned behavior predicted 43 and 46 of the variance in farmers intention and behavior respectively rahimi et al 2017 social cognitive theory predicted 43 and 46 of the variance in farmers intention and behavior respectively yazdanpanah et al 2015 norm activation model predicted 49 of the variance in farmers behavior and social capital predicted 45 and 47 of the variance in farmers intention and behavior respectively rahimi et al 2016 furthermore in their meta analysis armitage and conner 2001 found that the average explained variance of intention and behavior applying the theory of planned behavior and the theory of reasoned action was about 39 and 27 respectively therefore in appraisal with past literature regarding the prediction capacity of the cultural model our result is satisfactory and current result showed that the cultural capital was equally good at illumination growers willingness and behavior it is important to note that it is the first time this model has been quantified furthermore cultural capital is a european model being carried out for the first time in an islamic iranian culture context therefore the model needs greater elaboration with respect to quantification and the new context the current research can shed more light on that model but within a new cultural context the results of this study suggest that cultural capital could be a serious competitor to the current behavioral models in environmental behavior and is worth pursuing further here we have illustrated that bourdieu s capitals approach appears to have some utility for understanding behavioral choices in agriculture however as the first study of its kind there are a number of issues that need to be addressed in future research first this has only been a partial application of the notion of capital while here we have simplified the study by focusing on cultural capital alone because it forms the core of the habitus and has been the focus of previous qualitative studies of farmer behavior within bourdieu s framework social capital and economic capital are additional areas in which capital can be stored and exchanged thus in order to assess total capital a means of integrating these forms of capital into the model is also required it would be interesting to see whether the incorporation of cultural and social capital into economic models focusing on economic capital improves the predictive ability of economic models second we have applied the theory here to a very specific aspect of farmer behavior farmer s irrigation behavior we are not able to assess whether this constitutes a specific case or if the lessons learned here have generic implications for farming behaviors this requires further investigation through applying the approach to a wider range of issues third as a cultural theory we need to develop a greater understanding of how it applies in cultural contexts outside of iran we have already noted that the theoretical framework based on cultural capital was developed in a western context the fact that it also functions in iran suggests that the concept may be able to be applied generically but we are still in need of studies in a range of different cultural contexts fourth there is the issue of overlapping constructs more theoretical development is required here for example as we note earlier the concept of cultural capital and habitus lay out a cultural framework within which deliberative decisions are taken but understanding how and when cultural frameworks rather than cognitive decision making frameworks are better for understanding farmer behavior requires further work the possibility exists of combining socio psychological models with a cultural approach into a hybrid model but that was not within the scope of our study perhaps the most important issue is the need to separate the influence of the cultural importance of the variables measured here from their influence over utility as noted earlier objects on the farm such as a new irrigation machine only provide cultural capital when others within the peer community interpret it as culturally symbolic the object in itself does not necessarily provide cultural capital however the objects that provide cultural capital in the case of agriculture generally do so because they are also of great practical utility this raises the question of whether measures of objective cultural capital in our case the best predictor of intended behavior and behavior are measuring cultural capital enhanced control beliefs or both in our study we based the assessment on theory however it may be possible in future studies to assess the cultural relevance of objects skills knowledge and so on in a pre test in terms of its use for policy the case has already been made by burton and paragahawewa 2011 that being able to measure and understand cultural capital would enable policy makers to incorporate loss of cultural capital when considering compensation rates for schemes designed to change behavior prior to this study there have been a lack of empirical studies on both how to implement measures of cultural capital and indeed whether such measures would have any behavioral implications we now cautiously suggest that it is possible to develop quantitative measures of cultural capital and that these measures indeed have implications for farmers behavioral choices 6 conclusion the aim of this study was to examine the intention and behavior of water conservation of farmers in a region in western iran to this end we have used a theoretical framework which is considered more qualitative and rarely quantified cultural capital theory was coined by french philosopher bourdieu analysis revealed that the embodied cultural capital and objective cultural capital predicted have significant effect on intention furthermore path relationships revealed that the institutionalised cultural capital objective cultural capital intention and family experiences predicted farmers behavior moreover in appraisal with past literature regarding the prediction capacity of the cultural model our result is satisfactory and current results showed that the cultural capital was equally good at illuminating growers willingness and behavior it is important to note that this is the first time this model has been quantified credit authorship contribution statement fatemeh rahimi feyzabad methodology software formal analysis
