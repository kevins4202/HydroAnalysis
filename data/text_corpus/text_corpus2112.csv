10560,desalinated sea water dsw provides a steady agricultural water supply that overcomes climatological and hydrological constraints fostering food security and socio economic stability in water stressed regions in the last decade seawater desalination for irrigation has been massively implemented in south eastern se spain amid rising pressure and competition for water resources however farmers seem reluctant to replace conventional water sources with dsw due to its higher price and the need for additional fertilization this article assesses how fertigation cost increases can affect farming profitability when integrating dsw for irrigation the increases in water and fertilizer costs of totally 100 and partially 50 replacing conventional water with dsw were calculated for the most representative crops of the segura basin in se spain the results show that the total replacement of conventional resources implies a fertigation cost increase equivalent to 3 2 35 5 of the crop production costs however replacing only 50 of the conventional resources reduces these figures by more than half 1 5 15 7 this supra linear decrease comes from the fact that although water blending halves the water cost increase the fertilizer cost increase is reduced by more than half looking at the fertigation cost increase relative to crop profit remarkable profitability losses were observed for all crops in the total replacement scenario 21 6 129 1 which only fell to more acceptable levels in the partial replacement scenario 10 3 57 1 in the scenario with 100 dsw the estimated revenue increase required to compensate for the increase in the fertigation cost seems unrealistic for traditional crops 15 for melon and 25 for lemon whereas substantially more moderate increases are demanded from all crops 10 when only 50 dsw is used overall this study stresses the need to properly evaluate water blending options to maintain agricultural profitability keywords desalination irrigation fertilization water blending farming profitability 1 introduction water scarce regions increasingly need to devise water management strategies that include non conventional resources to face the reality that traditional irrigation with conventional water cannot meet current nor future demands of irrigated agriculture burn et al 2015 kaner et al 2017 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc put forward desalination as a potential option to adapt agriculture to climate change impacts especially in arid and semi arid regions bates et al 2008 the industrial production of desalinated sea water dsw provides a steady water supply that overcomes climatological and hydrological constraints and mitigates drought risks its incorporation into regional water plans and policies fosters long term food security and socio economic stability in water stressed regions however the high price and potential agronomic risks of dsw are bolstering farmers unacceptance and hindering its adoption dsw has emerged in the last decade as a promising water supply for the water starved agricultural sector in the mediterranean area particularly in spain and israel martinez alvarez et al 2016 bar tal et al 2017 arahuetes et al 2018 the first field experiences with dsw for agricultural use have shown both strengths and weaknesses on the positive side the low salinity of dsw boosts the quality and quantity of crop yields since it is often used to replace marginal low quality resources while preventing salt leaching and preserving soils and groundwater martinez alvarez et al 2017 on the negative side the main drawbacks are i the high energy consumption for production and distribution which results in considerably higher unit costs than for conventional water and thus jeopardizes crop profitability march et al 2014 martinez alvarez et al 2019 ii its singular chemical composition substantially different from conventional resources implies agronomic risks such as crop toxicity and soil alkalinization as well as higher fertilization requirements yermiyahu et al 2007 ben gal et al 2009 and iii the exacerbation of the water energy nexus caused by dsw production means higher greenhouse gas emissions unless clean energy is used martinez alvarez et al 2017 focusing on the agronomic concerns despite the fact that the total content of dissolved salts in dsw is much lower than in most conventional waters the concentration of certain ions prone to produce phytotoxicity particularly boron exceeds the tolerance threshold of sensitive crops hilal et al 2011 mendoza grimón et al 2019 moreover dsw lacks certain essential nutrients for plant growth such as ca2 and mg2 which are generally abundant in conventional irrigation waters these ions usually play a secondary role in open field fertilization owing to their presence in conventional irrigation water and soils which generally satisfy crop requirements ben gal et al 2009 martinez alvarez et al 2017 in contrast greenhouse crops especially in soilless production systems usually receive additional ca2 and mg2 fertilization therefore when switching from conventional waters to dsw the chemical composition of the new irrigation water must be taken into account to avoid plant physiological disorders or growth limitations such as those reported for several crops in israel yermiyahu et al 2007 avni et al 2013 bar tal et al 2017 hakkwan et al 2020 to address potential nutritional deficiencies mainly ca2 and mg2 involved in using dsw the best strategy when possible is to blend dsw with other water sources with a high mineral content hard waters rather than using additional fertilizers ben gal et al 2009 showed that the blend of 30 brackish groundwater with 70 desalinated water can provide satisfactory concentrations of ca2 and mg2 for the greenhouse pepper crop in israel preventing the additional fertilizer cost of 3500 ha 1 incurred when only desalinated water was used however this comes with the challenge of managing a wider range of fertilizers and having to adapt the fertigation programs to the composition of a given water blend it should be noted that this is expected to be technically feasible in south eastern se spain and israel since irrigation facilities usually incorporate precision fertilizer injection systems to optimize dsw agricultural use reca et al 2018 presented an optimization model for greenhouse irrigation management to help farmers blend saline water and dsw their case study demonstrated that i a large amount of site and crop specific data is required to properly evaluate the economic effect of dws integration and that ii the potential yield increase and irrigation water savings depend on the characteristics of the crop and the type of irrigation water that is replaced therefore water blending options and their agronomic and economic effects should be analyzed in detail for each farming case aznar sánchez et al 2017 conducted a survey in se spain to assess farmers perceptions regarding the use of dsw for irrigation their results disclosed low acceptance levels mainly attributed to its higher price and the need for additional fertilization as well as the general misconception that dsw may negatively affect crop yield and quality it is important to note that the surveyed farmers did not use dsw but they were certainly reluctant to use dsw amid concerns about its potential economic impacts in acknowledgement of the farmers concerns and to gain a more objective perspective this study evaluates the potential impact on fertigation water plus fertilizers costs of fully and partially replacing the conventional water supply with dsw for the most representative crops and production systems in an agricultural area of se spain to that end we calculated the fertigation requirements and costs associated to three supply situations only conventional water only dsw and a 50 50 blend of both the fertigation costs were evaluated relative to the production costs and profit to identify which crops profitability is at stake if conventional water is partially or totally replaced by dsw finally we estimated the required increase in revenue from improving the quality and or quantity of crop yield to counterbalance the rise in water and fertilizer costs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area our study area the mar menor zone is located in the segura basin which is a highly productive agricultural region in se spain it is very representative of the intensive agriculture systems in the basin whose economy is largely built on the export of high value fruits and vegetables the study zone is one of the fourteen hydrologic zones areas of homogeneous hydrologic and geomorphological characteristics the segura basin is divided into fig 1 the official estimation chs confederación hidrográfica de la cuenca del segura 2015 is that the water resources in this basin amount to 1602 mm3 y 1 which includes surface and groundwater 854 mm3 y 1 external water transfers 322 mm3 y 1 reclaimed water 144 mm3 y 1 irrigation returns 124 mm3 y 1 and dsw 158 mm3 y 1 these resources fail to satisfy the total water demand of 1834 mm3 y 1 for irrigated agriculture 1546 mm3 y 1 urban supply 236 mm3 y 1 industrial uses 20 mm3 y 1 and environmental flows 32 mm3 y 1 not all resources can be used unregulated streams flash floods etc and currently the annual water deficit is about 400 mm3 which directly impacts irrigated agriculture such a deficit represents a continuous pressure that threatens the strategic agricultural production and explains the massive seawater desalination implemented in this region swyngedouw and williams 2016 martinez alvarez et al 2019 the mar menor zone is currently supplied by three seawater desalination plants torrevieja valdelentisco and escombreras and is probably the place in the world with the largest agricultural dsw supply fig 1 shows the location of these plants and how their distribution pipelines spread through the irrigated farmlands which occupy 78 726 out of 160 200 ha 49 1 in the zone the water supply to farmers is organized by irrigation districts among which the campo de cartagena irrigation district ccid stands out in size 41 065 ha the largest in the basin previous technical and research activities in this district soto garcia et al 2013a b provide plenty of information regarding the irrigation and fertilizer requirements as well as the production costs revenues and profits for the most relevant crops and production systems in the area this data has proved very useful for our study the importance of dsw for irrigation has singularly increased in the study area in recent years the evolution of the agricultural dsw supply in the mar menor zone over the last decade is presented in fig 2 a it rose from 0 in 2008 to 75 8 mm3 y 1 in 2016 and has stayed above 60 mm3 y 1 since then data collected from the ccid show the growing relative importance of the resource fig 2b which in 2017 2019 accounted for over 22 of total irrigation water 2 2 selected crops water and fertilizer requirements we have selected six cases for analysis which are the combination of four crops lettuce melon lemon and pepper and two production systems soil and hydroponic soil and hydroponic lettuce lettuce s and lettuce h it is a winter vegetable that represents 15 of irrigated crops in the area we used data of the variety little gem grown outdoors in soil and with hydroponic systems nutrient film technique soil and hydroponic sweet pepper pepper s and pepper h it is an annual vegetable representative of the scarce greenhouse crops in the area which amounts to 4 of the irrigated crops data correspond to peppers grown directly in soil or in hydroponic cultivation usually on coconut fibers or perlite melon it is the predominant summer vegetable representing 11 of irrigated crops in the area it is usually grown outdoors in soil with low plastic tunnels for earliness in planting and harvesting and for season extension lemon this is the most common and traditional orchard in the area where citrus trees represent 22 of the irrigated crops the selected crops currently cover 52 of the study area and are representative of the main existing crop groups and production systems this allows to gain a general perspective of the economic impact on fertigation of incorporating dsw into the farming activity of the study area table 1 and table 2 present the irrigation and fertilizer requirements of studied crops in soil and hydroponic cultivation respectively as well as the production target without agronomic restrictions maximum yield data was collected from the scientific literature referred in the tables 2 3 water supply situations and water replacement scenarios the fertigation requirements and costs are analyzed under three supply situations situation 0 dsw this refers to the traditional water supply with surface water coming from the segura basin or external water transfers this conventional water has low electrical conductivity i e low salinity ec 0 86 ds m and high concentration of ca2 and mg2 97 and 40 mg l 1 respectively the water price for farmers is 0 16 m 3 situation 100 dsw here we assume that all the water supplied for irrigation is dsw we use the water quality data from the escombreras plant which currently devotes all its production 20 mm3 y 1 to crop irrigation the dsw from escombreras has physical and chemical properties similar to those of the other desalination plants in the zone martinez alvarez et al 2017 and is characterized by very low salinity ec 0 54 ds m and low ca2 and mg2 concentrations 20 and 2 mg l 1 respectively the water price for farmers is 0 60 m 3 martinez alvarez et al 2019 situation 50 dsw in this case the irrigation supply is half dsw and half conventional water which has intermediate values for the physical and chemical properties and price 0 38 m 3 the blending of these waters is in fact becoming a common on farm management practice followed by farmers to reduce the water cost table 3 presents the mean of the monthly values of the physical and chemical water properties for each situation from standardized operational water control analyses conducted in 2017 by the ccid and escombreras plant staff we assess the impact of fully and partially switching from conventional to dsw according to the following two scenarios total replacement scenario this consists in replacing 100 of conventional water with dsw i e moving from 0 dsw to 100 dsw partial replacement scenario this consists in replacing 50 of conventional water with dsw i e moving from 0 dsw to 50 dsw 2 4 calculation of fertigation programs fertigation is a common practice to deliver water and nutrients to soil and soilless vegetable and fruit crops in the study area many factors come into play in determining the type and quantity of fertilizer needed to produce satisfactory and environmentally safe fertigation programs there are abundant fertigation simulators and applications in the literature for managing the use of fertilizers in soil and soilless crops moreira et al 2012 pérez castro et al 2017 but few of them provide the possibility of calculating the optimal combination of fertilizers to reach the nutritional needs at a minimum cost bueno delgado et al 2016 herein we used a two step simulation model fig 3 that calculates the optimal combination of fertilizers to obtain a nutrient solution which satisfies the nutritional requirements of each crop at the cheapest rate first the model calculates the nutrients that must be added to the irrigation water to satisfy the uptake for each crop total nutrients dose in soil cultivation table 1 or ideal nutrient solution for hydroponic cultivation table 2 for a given chemical composition of the water supply table 3 the optimization algorithm then selects the type and quantity of commercial fertilizers from the database of available fertilizers table 4 that can provide the nutrients needs at the minimum cost the simulation model is coded in python 3 and uses common scientific libraries the optimization algorithm runs the optimize minimize function of the scipy library for constrained minimization with the sequential least squares programming slsqp to minimize the cost function considering a set of constraints the main restrictions were to keep the ec of the nutritive solution after fertilizer injection below the selected threshold value and to neutralize bicarbonates with the sum of fertilizer h ions at the concentration of 0 5 mmol l 1 the commercial fertilizers in the database are those commonly available to farmers in the study area they have high water solubility to prevent emitter clogging and a low salt index to avoid unwanted increases in salinity the prices and composition indicated in table 4 correspond to fertilizer suppliers of the study area 2 5 economic impact assessment the crop fertigation costs fgc consist of the water cost wc plus the fertilizer cost fzc which were calculated for each crop in every water supply situation the economic impact fgc increase in the total and partial replacement scenarios is the cost difference between fgc for 0 dsw and for 100 dsw or 50 dsw respectively in addition to calculating the total fgc increase ha 1 we looked at the relative magnitude of these figures compared to the total production costs and the crop profit to evaluate the profitability risk in each scenario it should be highlighted that the total production cost table 5 is stable and therefore a more robust indicator of the impact in farming economy than the crop profit the production cost shows scant interannual variation whereas the profit depends directly on the selling price of the harvest which fluctuates substantially as shown in section 3 4 with the annual market supply and demand table 5 shows economic data for the commercial production of the six selected crops for the reference situation i e 0 dsw adapted from the scientific and technical literature on the topic references given in the table the total production costs consist of investment as well as operational costs the investment cost is the annual fee over the life span equivalent to the initial investment that enables the activity start up while the operational costs correspond to annual or seasonal inputs used in the productive process the operational costs were inventoried based on four categories raw materials irrigation water electricity fuel fertilizers plant protection products plantlets and others labor machinery and land rent further details about the investment and operational costs can be found in the references indicated in the table our study looks at the impact on operational costs in the category of raw materials and particularly at irrigation water and fertilizers within that category assuming than the rest of the costs and final yield remain the same the revenue is calculated as the crop yield tables 1 and 2 multiplied by the average selling price paid to the farmer lettuce 0 08 unit 1 melon 0 32 kg 1 lemon 0 20 kg 1 pepper 0 76 kg 1 following the regional agricultural statistic service for the decade 2010 2019 carm comunidad autónoma de la región de murcia 2019 finally the profit is the difference between the total costs and the revenue it should be noted that we assumed that the investment and the operational costs come from farmer funds and hence there are no financial costs the costs for taxes and insurances were not considered either 3 results and discussion 3 1 fertilizer consumption in the reference situation 0 dsw we observed how the conventional water was able to supply ca2 and mg2 for soil cultivation without having to apply any fertilizer containing those nutrients calcium nitrate calcium chloride magnesium nitrate and magnesium sulfate however hydroponic cultivation with conventional water requires the addition of ca2 with calcium nitrate for lettuce h and pepper h and of mg2 with magnesium nitrate for pepper h moreover the high concentration of bicarbonate in this water hco3 180 mg l 1 leads to the use of a substantial amount of acid to control the ph the ph value in the nutritive solution must be within the range 5 6 where nutrients become more available to plants thus allowing to complete the phosphate needs with phosphoric acid for all cases and even to satisfy part of the nitrogen needs with nitric acid the fertilizer selection changes significantly for the total replacement scenario substantial amounts of calcium and magnesium nitrate are now included for all crops and production systems to satisfy the ca2 and mg2 needs reaching very high doses in hydroponic cultivation for the latter it should be noted that even calcium chloride and magnesium sulfate are required for pepper h in addition since the bicarbonate concentration is now much lower hco3 68 mg l 1 the quantity of phosphoric acid required to bring the ph to the desired value is not enough to meet the phosphorous needs in hydroponic cultivation this situation requires the addition of phosphorous with monoammonium phosphate which is a more expensive and unusual fertilizer in the study area it should be noted that this is also the reason why there is a marked decrease or removal in the traditional use of nitric acid for soil and hydroponic cultivation respectively in contrast with the total replacement scenario the concentration of ca2 and mg2 in the partial replacement scenario is enough to avoid the provision of these nutrients in soil cultivation accordingly in the hydroponic cultivation the required amount of calcium nitrate and magnesium nitrate shows an apparent reduction and more importantly the use of calcium chloride and magnesium sulfate is avoided the bicarbonate concentration in this case is moderate hco3 124 mg l 1 allowing the fulfillment of phosphate needs with phosphoric acid for all crops except pepper h without resorting to monoammonium phosphate these results show that the total replacement of conventional water with dws implies not only the need for greater amounts of fertilizers but the requirement of more types of fertilizers including some unusual and more costly products moreover for proper fertigation management in this scenario irrigation heads may require adaptive investments all these difficulties and costs are notably mitigated in the partial replacement scenario in that case the type of fertilizers remains very similar to the reference scenario and precludes the need for less usual fertilizers for hydroponic cultivation 3 2 fertigation costs tables 6 11 also show the fertigation cost fgc which is the sum of the water cost wc and the fertilizers cost fzc for each crop and water supply situation the wc depends directly on the crop irrigation requirements tables 1 and 2 and changes across water supply situations proportionally to the water price 0 16 m 3 for 0 dsw 0 60 m 3 for 100 dsw and 0 38 m 3 for 50 dsw the fzc depends on the type and dose of fertilizers selected by the simulation model fertilizer prices provided in table 4 the fgc increase split into wc and fzc increases for both scenarios is shown in fig 4 in the total replacement scenario the fgc increases ranged from 1699 ha 1 in lettuce s to 7067 ha 1 in pepper h jeopardizing farming profitability as analyzed in section 3 3 the wc increase is significant for all crops from 1628 ha 1 in lettuce s to 4400 ha 1 in pepper h and proportional to the irrigation requirements in contrast the fzc increase is relatively low for soil cultivation from 33 ha 1 in lemon to 173 ha 1 in pepper s and only relevant for hydroponic cultivation 627 ha 1 in lettuce h and 2670 ha 1 in pepper h the latter figure is in line with the fzc increase reported for a greenhouse pepper crop in israel 3500 ha 1 3150 ha 1 by ben gal et al 2009 our results confirm that in some cases the fzc increase can in fact reach a similar magnitude to the wc increase which to some extent justifies the farmers concerns shown by aznar sánchez et al 2017 however it is important to stress that this affects only the most intensive farming conditions greenhouse production hydroponic systems annual crop cycle and that the fzc increase is insignificant in soil cultivation unlike the segura basin in the neighboring agricultural region of almeria greenhouse cultivation of long cycle vegetables is the predominant irrigated production system valera et al 2016 and this issue poses a noteworthy threat to profitability in the partial replacement scenario the fgc increase ranged from 801 ha 1 in lettuce s to 3086 ha 1 in pepper h these values are for all crops less than half the corresponding value in the total replacement scenario showing how blending waters can reduce the fgc supra linearly the wc increase between scenarios is linear in relation to the unit water price increase the water price increase halved from the total to the partial replacement scenario 0 22 m 3 instead of 0 44 m 3 the observed non linearity comes from the fact that the fzc increase is i null or even negative for soil cultivation from 137 ha 1 in lemon to 1 ha 1 in pepper s and ii more than half lower for hydroponic cultivation 146 ha 1 and 886 ha 1 for lettuce h and pepper h respectively these results indicate that blending water 50 dsw is a very recommendable management option for farmers because apart from the obvious linear decrease in the wc it reduces the fzc increase supra linearly in hydroponic cultivation and can even save some fertilizer costs in soil cultivation finally it is pertinent to mention that there is an alternative approach to deal with the low concentrations of ca2 and mg2 in dsw the concentrations of these ions can also be increased in the post treatment stage of desalination the cost of providing ca2 concentrations suitable for agriculture at desalination plants is very low and can be easily achieved by intensifying the traditional post treatments of hydrated lime or limestone dissolution by carbon dioxide fritzmann et al 2007 more novel post treatment stages would also allow the addition of suitable mg2 concentrations at an acceptable cost penn et al 2009 birnhack et al 2014 this may be the best option in regions where dsw is mostly allocated to hydroponic crops 3 3 economic impact in section 3 2 we have quantified the fgc increase resulting from partially and totally switching from conventional water to dsw in this section this cost increase is evaluated in relation to the total crop production costs as well as to the expected profit presented in table 5 for the reference scenario the relative value of the increase in the fgc split into wc and fzc with respect to the total production costs for the partial and total replacement scenario is given in fig 5 a in the total replacement scenario the increase in wc ha 1 relative to production costs is far more relevant than in the fzc for all crops ranging from 2 6 in lettuce h to 35 1 in lemon the fzc increase represents less than 1 of the production costs for all the crops except for pepper h 4 4 the aggregation of both into the fgc gives values ranging from 3 2 in lettuce h to 35 5 in lemon these results clearly point to the high price of dsw as being the main cause of the potential economic impact on the farming economy while the fzc increase seems to only economically jeopardize pepper h another interesting observation is the fact that the crops with highest relative impact lemon and melon differ from those with highest absolute impact lettuce h pepper s and pepper h nevertheless the key question still remains unanswered for which crops does the 100 dsw scenario pose a real threat to their profitability this last question is addressed in fig 5b which represents the relevance of the fgc increase split into wc and fzc relative to crop profit we can clearly observe how all crops are negatively affected with important decreases in their profitability 46 2 in lettuce s 24 1 in lettuce h 71 8 in melon 129 1 in lemon 21 6 in pepper s and 48 3 in pepper h the value over 100 for lemon indicates that the production of this crop would cease to be profitable therefore the answer to that question is that the total replacement scenario has a very serious impact on farming profitability deeply affecting traditional crops such as melon and lemon to the point of rendering them economically unviable the prospect for the partial replacement scenario is fortunately very different in this case the increase in the fgc is more than 50 mitigated due to non linearity facts as presented in the previous section the relative relevance of the fgc to the production costs now ranges from 1 45 in lettuce h to 15 71 in lemon the wc increase halves and the fzc effect is almost negligible and even negative for some crops from 1 82 in lemon to 1 45 in pepper h accordingly the relevance of the fgc in relation to crop profit is significantly lower 21 8 in lettuce s 10 9 in lettuce h 33 9 in melon 57 1 in lemon 10 3 in pepper s and 21 1 in pepper h these results indicate although some traditional crops melon and lemon would suffer drastic drops in profitability the farming activity would remain profitable for all crops therefore this confirms that water blending strategies which have been brought up by numerous authors ben gal et al 2009 avni et al 2013 martinez alvarez et al 2016 reca et al 2018 should be carefully studied to mitigate the impact of integrating dsw for irrigation 3 4 economic impact mitigation thus far we have assessed the impact of replacing the conventional water of the study area by dsw the availability of the conventional irrigation water considered here which has a very good quality and price for crops has dramatically decreased during the last decade amid population political and environmental pressure in fact the use of low quality water for irrigation in mediterranean regions is common bortolini et al 2018 especially in regions with increasing water shortages such as se spain and israel where better quality waters are allocated for domestic supply whilst agriculture resorts to marginal waters for that reason the replacement of water available for irrigation with dsw usually implies a noticeable reduction in the ec of the irrigation water and consequently an increase in the quality and quantity of crop yields some examples of these beneficial effects have already been reported for example pérez talavera 1996 and silber et al 2015 reported substantial yield increases and water savings in banana crops in the canary islands and israel respectively in se spain zarzo et al 2013 found that replacing brackish groundwater with dsw increased production by 50 in citrus and valera et al 2018 reported greenhouse yield increases of 44 in tomato and 41 in pepper as well as improvements in the quality of the harvest therefore integrating dsw can potentially boost yield quantity and quality and thereby increase revenue which can offset the increase in the fgc fig 6 displays the required increase in crop revenue to counterbalance the fgc increase for the replacement scenarios of our study case the values for the total replacement scenario were 7 52 in lettuce s 2 83 in lettuce h 16 04 in melon 27 84 in lemon 6 24 in pepper s and 9 33 in pepper h these figures reveal that for lettuce and pepper in both production systems a moderate below 10 revenue increase would suffice to compensate for the additional fgc whereas the most traditional crops melon and lemon would probably struggle to reach compensation once again the prospects look much better for the partial replacement scenario in which the revenue rise for compensation is below 10 except in lemon 12 32 the values obtained for the required increase in crop revenue to counterbalance the production costs increase are in most cases within the range of the results reported by other authors indicating that they can be affordable when low quality irrigation water is managed furthermore the current trend and expectation is that the quality and quantity of water for irrigation continues to decrease thus making dsw a more attractive resource that can help sustain yield and profitability despite its cost the results referring to the revenues and profits should be considered with caution since the variability of the selling price paid to farmers is high fig 6 includes the dispersion range when considering the annual selling price paid to farmers for the last decade 2010 2019 instead of its mean value for that period showing a great uncertainty since annual values can lead to doubling or halving the results for the mean values 4 conclusions this study evaluates to what extent fertigation cost fgc increases pose a threat to farming profitability when integrating dsw for irrigation in se spain we calculated the increase in water and fertilizer costs fgc wc fzc of totally 100 and partially 50 replacing conventional irrigation water with dsw for the most representative crops of the segura basin lettuce and pepper in both soil and hydroponic culture and melon and lemon in soil the results for the total replacement scenario showed that the fgc increase is equivalent to 3 2 35 5 of the crop production costs and to a reduction of crop profitability ranging from 21 6 129 1 this is a considerable loss for all crops and in the case of traditional crops such as lemon it would entail the end of economic viability the main source of the fgc increase lies in the wc increase which is significant for all crops from 1628 ha 1 in lettuce s to 4400 ha 1 in pepper h the fzc increase is relatively low for soil cultivation from 33 ha 1 in lemon to 173 ha 1 in pepper s but relevant for hydroponic cultivation 627 ha 1 in lettuce h and 2670 ha 1 in pepper h moreover for the latter the fertigation programs change significantly and require greater amounts and types of fertilizers as well as equipment upgrades the partial replacement scenario provided a much better outlook since the fgc increase was reduced more than linear the fgc increase represents 1 5 15 7 of the crop production costs and the crop profitability falls by 10 3 57 1 so in this case the farming activity would remain economically feasible for most crops the supra linear decrease comes from the fact that blending water halves the wc increase and reduces the fzc increase by more than half in hydroponic cultivation and can even save some fertilizer costs in soil cultivation this stresses the need for properly evaluating water blending options to maintain profitability the potential agronomic effects on yield and water savings were not considered for the analysis the latter can have both positive and negative impacts and would require careful evaluation for each case using specific crop and site data we do however give an estimation of the required increase in crop revenue positive impact of dsw integration to counterbalance the fgc increase these calculations showed that only lettuce and pepper in both production systems could probably compensate for the total replacement scenario with a moderate increase in revenue this compensation seems far more feasible below 10 increase in revenue for most crops in the 50 dsw scenario once again highlighting the need for water blending strategies from a practical point of view apart from the proposed blending strategies the following recommendations can further help farmers mitigating the economic impacts of integrating dsw firstly as water costs increase the choice of crops can make a real difference in economic sustainably crops with lower water requirements shorter cycles and grown in winter should be prioritized on the contrary long term crops with high investments such as orchards are not advised secondly frequent water quality monitoring would allow optimizing blending strategies and fertigation programs to that end irrigation heads would ideally be equipped with water quality monitoring devices and smart blending systems overall this study aims to improve current knowledge regarding the impact of integrating dsw into irrigated agriculture and provides objective information to steer decision making and address farmers concerns the most relevant piece of information is the demonstration of the benefits of water blending on fertigation costs building on this work we are currently developing a smart fertigation tool that optimizes the on farm blend of dws with other water resources reclaimed water brackish

10560,desalinated sea water dsw provides a steady agricultural water supply that overcomes climatological and hydrological constraints fostering food security and socio economic stability in water stressed regions in the last decade seawater desalination for irrigation has been massively implemented in south eastern se spain amid rising pressure and competition for water resources however farmers seem reluctant to replace conventional water sources with dsw due to its higher price and the need for additional fertilization this article assesses how fertigation cost increases can affect farming profitability when integrating dsw for irrigation the increases in water and fertilizer costs of totally 100 and partially 50 replacing conventional water with dsw were calculated for the most representative crops of the segura basin in se spain the results show that the total replacement of conventional resources implies a fertigation cost increase equivalent to 3 2 35 5 of the crop production costs however replacing only 50 of the conventional resources reduces these figures by more than half 1 5 15 7 this supra linear decrease comes from the fact that although water blending halves the water cost increase the fertilizer cost increase is reduced by more than half looking at the fertigation cost increase relative to crop profit remarkable profitability losses were observed for all crops in the total replacement scenario 21 6 129 1 which only fell to more acceptable levels in the partial replacement scenario 10 3 57 1 in the scenario with 100 dsw the estimated revenue increase required to compensate for the increase in the fertigation cost seems unrealistic for traditional crops 15 for melon and 25 for lemon whereas substantially more moderate increases are demanded from all crops 10 when only 50 dsw is used overall this study stresses the need to properly evaluate water blending options to maintain agricultural profitability keywords desalination irrigation fertilization water blending farming profitability 1 introduction water scarce regions increasingly need to devise water management strategies that include non conventional resources to face the reality that traditional irrigation with conventional water cannot meet current nor future demands of irrigated agriculture burn et al 2015 kaner et al 2017 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc put forward desalination as a potential option to adapt agriculture to climate change impacts especially in arid and semi arid regions bates et al 2008 the industrial production of desalinated sea water dsw provides a steady water supply that overcomes climatological and hydrological constraints and mitigates drought risks its incorporation into regional water plans and policies fosters long term food security and socio economic stability in water stressed regions however the high price and potential agronomic risks of dsw are bolstering farmers unacceptance and hindering its adoption dsw has emerged in the last decade as a promising water supply for the water starved agricultural sector in the mediterranean area particularly in spain and israel martinez alvarez et al 2016 bar tal et al 2017 arahuetes et al 2018 the first field experiences with dsw for agricultural use have shown both strengths and weaknesses on the positive side the low salinity of dsw boosts the quality and quantity of crop yields since it is often used to replace marginal low quality resources while preventing salt leaching and preserving soils and groundwater martinez alvarez et al 2017 on the negative side the main drawbacks are i the high energy consumption for production and distribution which results in considerably higher unit costs than for conventional water and thus jeopardizes crop profitability march et al 2014 martinez alvarez et al 2019 ii its singular chemical composition substantially different from conventional resources implies agronomic risks such as crop toxicity and soil alkalinization as well as higher fertilization requirements yermiyahu et al 2007 ben gal et al 2009 and iii the exacerbation of the water energy nexus caused by dsw production means higher greenhouse gas emissions unless clean energy is used martinez alvarez et al 2017 focusing on the agronomic concerns despite the fact that the total content of dissolved salts in dsw is much lower than in most conventional waters the concentration of certain ions prone to produce phytotoxicity particularly boron exceeds the tolerance threshold of sensitive crops hilal et al 2011 mendoza grimón et al 2019 moreover dsw lacks certain essential nutrients for plant growth such as ca2 and mg2 which are generally abundant in conventional irrigation waters these ions usually play a secondary role in open field fertilization owing to their presence in conventional irrigation water and soils which generally satisfy crop requirements ben gal et al 2009 martinez alvarez et al 2017 in contrast greenhouse crops especially in soilless production systems usually receive additional ca2 and mg2 fertilization therefore when switching from conventional waters to dsw the chemical composition of the new irrigation water must be taken into account to avoid plant physiological disorders or growth limitations such as those reported for several crops in israel yermiyahu et al 2007 avni et al 2013 bar tal et al 2017 hakkwan et al 2020 to address potential nutritional deficiencies mainly ca2 and mg2 involved in using dsw the best strategy when possible is to blend dsw with other water sources with a high mineral content hard waters rather than using additional fertilizers ben gal et al 2009 showed that the blend of 30 brackish groundwater with 70 desalinated water can provide satisfactory concentrations of ca2 and mg2 for the greenhouse pepper crop in israel preventing the additional fertilizer cost of 3500 ha 1 incurred when only desalinated water was used however this comes with the challenge of managing a wider range of fertilizers and having to adapt the fertigation programs to the composition of a given water blend it should be noted that this is expected to be technically feasible in south eastern se spain and israel since irrigation facilities usually incorporate precision fertilizer injection systems to optimize dsw agricultural use reca et al 2018 presented an optimization model for greenhouse irrigation management to help farmers blend saline water and dsw their case study demonstrated that i a large amount of site and crop specific data is required to properly evaluate the economic effect of dws integration and that ii the potential yield increase and irrigation water savings depend on the characteristics of the crop and the type of irrigation water that is replaced therefore water blending options and their agronomic and economic effects should be analyzed in detail for each farming case aznar sánchez et al 2017 conducted a survey in se spain to assess farmers perceptions regarding the use of dsw for irrigation their results disclosed low acceptance levels mainly attributed to its higher price and the need for additional fertilization as well as the general misconception that dsw may negatively affect crop yield and quality it is important to note that the surveyed farmers did not use dsw but they were certainly reluctant to use dsw amid concerns about its potential economic impacts in acknowledgement of the farmers concerns and to gain a more objective perspective this study evaluates the potential impact on fertigation water plus fertilizers costs of fully and partially replacing the conventional water supply with dsw for the most representative crops and production systems in an agricultural area of se spain to that end we calculated the fertigation requirements and costs associated to three supply situations only conventional water only dsw and a 50 50 blend of both the fertigation costs were evaluated relative to the production costs and profit to identify which crops profitability is at stake if conventional water is partially or totally replaced by dsw finally we estimated the required increase in revenue from improving the quality and or quantity of crop yield to counterbalance the rise in water and fertilizer costs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area our study area the mar menor zone is located in the segura basin which is a highly productive agricultural region in se spain it is very representative of the intensive agriculture systems in the basin whose economy is largely built on the export of high value fruits and vegetables the study zone is one of the fourteen hydrologic zones areas of homogeneous hydrologic and geomorphological characteristics the segura basin is divided into fig 1 the official estimation chs confederación hidrográfica de la cuenca del segura 2015 is that the water resources in this basin amount to 1602 mm3 y 1 which includes surface and groundwater 854 mm3 y 1 external water transfers 322 mm3 y 1 reclaimed water 144 mm3 y 1 irrigation returns 124 mm3 y 1 and dsw 158 mm3 y 1 these resources fail to satisfy the total water demand of 1834 mm3 y 1 for irrigated agriculture 1546 mm3 y 1 urban supply 236 mm3 y 1 industrial uses 20 mm3 y 1 and environmental flows 32 mm3 y 1 not all resources can be used unregulated streams flash floods etc and currently the annual water deficit is about 400 mm3 which directly impacts irrigated agriculture such a deficit represents a continuous pressure that threatens the strategic agricultural production and explains the massive seawater desalination implemented in this region swyngedouw and williams 2016 martinez alvarez et al 2019 the mar menor zone is currently supplied by three seawater desalination plants torrevieja valdelentisco and escombreras and is probably the place in the world with the largest agricultural dsw supply fig 1 shows the location of these plants and how their distribution pipelines spread through the irrigated farmlands which occupy 78 726 out of 160 200 ha 49 1 in the zone the water supply to farmers is organized by irrigation districts among which the campo de cartagena irrigation district ccid stands out in size 41 065 ha the largest in the basin previous technical and research activities in this district soto garcia et al 2013a b provide plenty of information regarding the irrigation and fertilizer requirements as well as the production costs revenues and profits for the most relevant crops and production systems in the area this data has proved very useful for our study the importance of dsw for irrigation has singularly increased in the study area in recent years the evolution of the agricultural dsw supply in the mar menor zone over the last decade is presented in fig 2 a it rose from 0 in 2008 to 75 8 mm3 y 1 in 2016 and has stayed above 60 mm3 y 1 since then data collected from the ccid show the growing relative importance of the resource fig 2b which in 2017 2019 accounted for over 22 of total irrigation water 2 2 selected crops water and fertilizer requirements we have selected six cases for analysis which are the combination of four crops lettuce melon lemon and pepper and two production systems soil and hydroponic soil and hydroponic lettuce lettuce s and lettuce h it is a winter vegetable that represents 15 of irrigated crops in the area we used data of the variety little gem grown outdoors in soil and with hydroponic systems nutrient film technique soil and hydroponic sweet pepper pepper s and pepper h it is an annual vegetable representative of the scarce greenhouse crops in the area which amounts to 4 of the irrigated crops data correspond to peppers grown directly in soil or in hydroponic cultivation usually on coconut fibers or perlite melon it is the predominant summer vegetable representing 11 of irrigated crops in the area it is usually grown outdoors in soil with low plastic tunnels for earliness in planting and harvesting and for season extension lemon this is the most common and traditional orchard in the area where citrus trees represent 22 of the irrigated crops the selected crops currently cover 52 of the study area and are representative of the main existing crop groups and production systems this allows to gain a general perspective of the economic impact on fertigation of incorporating dsw into the farming activity of the study area table 1 and table 2 present the irrigation and fertilizer requirements of studied crops in soil and hydroponic cultivation respectively as well as the production target without agronomic restrictions maximum yield data was collected from the scientific literature referred in the tables 2 3 water supply situations and water replacement scenarios the fertigation requirements and costs are analyzed under three supply situations situation 0 dsw this refers to the traditional water supply with surface water coming from the segura basin or external water transfers this conventional water has low electrical conductivity i e low salinity ec 0 86 ds m and high concentration of ca2 and mg2 97 and 40 mg l 1 respectively the water price for farmers is 0 16 m 3 situation 100 dsw here we assume that all the water supplied for irrigation is dsw we use the water quality data from the escombreras plant which currently devotes all its production 20 mm3 y 1 to crop irrigation the dsw from escombreras has physical and chemical properties similar to those of the other desalination plants in the zone martinez alvarez et al 2017 and is characterized by very low salinity ec 0 54 ds m and low ca2 and mg2 concentrations 20 and 2 mg l 1 respectively the water price for farmers is 0 60 m 3 martinez alvarez et al 2019 situation 50 dsw in this case the irrigation supply is half dsw and half conventional water which has intermediate values for the physical and chemical properties and price 0 38 m 3 the blending of these waters is in fact becoming a common on farm management practice followed by farmers to reduce the water cost table 3 presents the mean of the monthly values of the physical and chemical water properties for each situation from standardized operational water control analyses conducted in 2017 by the ccid and escombreras plant staff we assess the impact of fully and partially switching from conventional to dsw according to the following two scenarios total replacement scenario this consists in replacing 100 of conventional water with dsw i e moving from 0 dsw to 100 dsw partial replacement scenario this consists in replacing 50 of conventional water with dsw i e moving from 0 dsw to 50 dsw 2 4 calculation of fertigation programs fertigation is a common practice to deliver water and nutrients to soil and soilless vegetable and fruit crops in the study area many factors come into play in determining the type and quantity of fertilizer needed to produce satisfactory and environmentally safe fertigation programs there are abundant fertigation simulators and applications in the literature for managing the use of fertilizers in soil and soilless crops moreira et al 2012 pérez castro et al 2017 but few of them provide the possibility of calculating the optimal combination of fertilizers to reach the nutritional needs at a minimum cost bueno delgado et al 2016 herein we used a two step simulation model fig 3 that calculates the optimal combination of fertilizers to obtain a nutrient solution which satisfies the nutritional requirements of each crop at the cheapest rate first the model calculates the nutrients that must be added to the irrigation water to satisfy the uptake for each crop total nutrients dose in soil cultivation table 1 or ideal nutrient solution for hydroponic cultivation table 2 for a given chemical composition of the water supply table 3 the optimization algorithm then selects the type and quantity of commercial fertilizers from the database of available fertilizers table 4 that can provide the nutrients needs at the minimum cost the simulation model is coded in python 3 and uses common scientific libraries the optimization algorithm runs the optimize minimize function of the scipy library for constrained minimization with the sequential least squares programming slsqp to minimize the cost function considering a set of constraints the main restrictions were to keep the ec of the nutritive solution after fertilizer injection below the selected threshold value and to neutralize bicarbonates with the sum of fertilizer h ions at the concentration of 0 5 mmol l 1 the commercial fertilizers in the database are those commonly available to farmers in the study area they have high water solubility to prevent emitter clogging and a low salt index to avoid unwanted increases in salinity the prices and composition indicated in table 4 correspond to fertilizer suppliers of the study area 2 5 economic impact assessment the crop fertigation costs fgc consist of the water cost wc plus the fertilizer cost fzc which were calculated for each crop in every water supply situation the economic impact fgc increase in the total and partial replacement scenarios is the cost difference between fgc for 0 dsw and for 100 dsw or 50 dsw respectively in addition to calculating the total fgc increase ha 1 we looked at the relative magnitude of these figures compared to the total production costs and the crop profit to evaluate the profitability risk in each scenario it should be highlighted that the total production cost table 5 is stable and therefore a more robust indicator of the impact in farming economy than the crop profit the production cost shows scant interannual variation whereas the profit depends directly on the selling price of the harvest which fluctuates substantially as shown in section 3 4 with the annual market supply and demand table 5 shows economic data for the commercial production of the six selected crops for the reference situation i e 0 dsw adapted from the scientific and technical literature on the topic references given in the table the total production costs consist of investment as well as operational costs the investment cost is the annual fee over the life span equivalent to the initial investment that enables the activity start up while the operational costs correspond to annual or seasonal inputs used in the productive process the operational costs were inventoried based on four categories raw materials irrigation water electricity fuel fertilizers plant protection products plantlets and others labor machinery and land rent further details about the investment and operational costs can be found in the references indicated in the table our study looks at the impact on operational costs in the category of raw materials and particularly at irrigation water and fertilizers within that category assuming than the rest of the costs and final yield remain the same the revenue is calculated as the crop yield tables 1 and 2 multiplied by the average selling price paid to the farmer lettuce 0 08 unit 1 melon 0 32 kg 1 lemon 0 20 kg 1 pepper 0 76 kg 1 following the regional agricultural statistic service for the decade 2010 2019 carm comunidad autónoma de la región de murcia 2019 finally the profit is the difference between the total costs and the revenue it should be noted that we assumed that the investment and the operational costs come from farmer funds and hence there are no financial costs the costs for taxes and insurances were not considered either 3 results and discussion 3 1 fertilizer consumption in the reference situation 0 dsw we observed how the conventional water was able to supply ca2 and mg2 for soil cultivation without having to apply any fertilizer containing those nutrients calcium nitrate calcium chloride magnesium nitrate and magnesium sulfate however hydroponic cultivation with conventional water requires the addition of ca2 with calcium nitrate for lettuce h and pepper h and of mg2 with magnesium nitrate for pepper h moreover the high concentration of bicarbonate in this water hco3 180 mg l 1 leads to the use of a substantial amount of acid to control the ph the ph value in the nutritive solution must be within the range 5 6 where nutrients become more available to plants thus allowing to complete the phosphate needs with phosphoric acid for all cases and even to satisfy part of the nitrogen needs with nitric acid the fertilizer selection changes significantly for the total replacement scenario substantial amounts of calcium and magnesium nitrate are now included for all crops and production systems to satisfy the ca2 and mg2 needs reaching very high doses in hydroponic cultivation for the latter it should be noted that even calcium chloride and magnesium sulfate are required for pepper h in addition since the bicarbonate concentration is now much lower hco3 68 mg l 1 the quantity of phosphoric acid required to bring the ph to the desired value is not enough to meet the phosphorous needs in hydroponic cultivation this situation requires the addition of phosphorous with monoammonium phosphate which is a more expensive and unusual fertilizer in the study area it should be noted that this is also the reason why there is a marked decrease or removal in the traditional use of nitric acid for soil and hydroponic cultivation respectively in contrast with the total replacement scenario the concentration of ca2 and mg2 in the partial replacement scenario is enough to avoid the provision of these nutrients in soil cultivation accordingly in the hydroponic cultivation the required amount of calcium nitrate and magnesium nitrate shows an apparent reduction and more importantly the use of calcium chloride and magnesium sulfate is avoided the bicarbonate concentration in this case is moderate hco3 124 mg l 1 allowing the fulfillment of phosphate needs with phosphoric acid for all crops except pepper h without resorting to monoammonium phosphate these results show that the total replacement of conventional water with dws implies not only the need for greater amounts of fertilizers but the requirement of more types of fertilizers including some unusual and more costly products moreover for proper fertigation management in this scenario irrigation heads may require adaptive investments all these difficulties and costs are notably mitigated in the partial replacement scenario in that case the type of fertilizers remains very similar to the reference scenario and precludes the need for less usual fertilizers for hydroponic cultivation 3 2 fertigation costs tables 6 11 also show the fertigation cost fgc which is the sum of the water cost wc and the fertilizers cost fzc for each crop and water supply situation the wc depends directly on the crop irrigation requirements tables 1 and 2 and changes across water supply situations proportionally to the water price 0 16 m 3 for 0 dsw 0 60 m 3 for 100 dsw and 0 38 m 3 for 50 dsw the fzc depends on the type and dose of fertilizers selected by the simulation model fertilizer prices provided in table 4 the fgc increase split into wc and fzc increases for both scenarios is shown in fig 4 in the total replacement scenario the fgc increases ranged from 1699 ha 1 in lettuce s to 7067 ha 1 in pepper h jeopardizing farming profitability as analyzed in section 3 3 the wc increase is significant for all crops from 1628 ha 1 in lettuce s to 4400 ha 1 in pepper h and proportional to the irrigation requirements in contrast the fzc increase is relatively low for soil cultivation from 33 ha 1 in lemon to 173 ha 1 in pepper s and only relevant for hydroponic cultivation 627 ha 1 in lettuce h and 2670 ha 1 in pepper h the latter figure is in line with the fzc increase reported for a greenhouse pepper crop in israel 3500 ha 1 3150 ha 1 by ben gal et al 2009 our results confirm that in some cases the fzc increase can in fact reach a similar magnitude to the wc increase which to some extent justifies the farmers concerns shown by aznar sánchez et al 2017 however it is important to stress that this affects only the most intensive farming conditions greenhouse production hydroponic systems annual crop cycle and that the fzc increase is insignificant in soil cultivation unlike the segura basin in the neighboring agricultural region of almeria greenhouse cultivation of long cycle vegetables is the predominant irrigated production system valera et al 2016 and this issue poses a noteworthy threat to profitability in the partial replacement scenario the fgc increase ranged from 801 ha 1 in lettuce s to 3086 ha 1 in pepper h these values are for all crops less than half the corresponding value in the total replacement scenario showing how blending waters can reduce the fgc supra linearly the wc increase between scenarios is linear in relation to the unit water price increase the water price increase halved from the total to the partial replacement scenario 0 22 m 3 instead of 0 44 m 3 the observed non linearity comes from the fact that the fzc increase is i null or even negative for soil cultivation from 137 ha 1 in lemon to 1 ha 1 in pepper s and ii more than half lower for hydroponic cultivation 146 ha 1 and 886 ha 1 for lettuce h and pepper h respectively these results indicate that blending water 50 dsw is a very recommendable management option for farmers because apart from the obvious linear decrease in the wc it reduces the fzc increase supra linearly in hydroponic cultivation and can even save some fertilizer costs in soil cultivation finally it is pertinent to mention that there is an alternative approach to deal with the low concentrations of ca2 and mg2 in dsw the concentrations of these ions can also be increased in the post treatment stage of desalination the cost of providing ca2 concentrations suitable for agriculture at desalination plants is very low and can be easily achieved by intensifying the traditional post treatments of hydrated lime or limestone dissolution by carbon dioxide fritzmann et al 2007 more novel post treatment stages would also allow the addition of suitable mg2 concentrations at an acceptable cost penn et al 2009 birnhack et al 2014 this may be the best option in regions where dsw is mostly allocated to hydroponic crops 3 3 economic impact in section 3 2 we have quantified the fgc increase resulting from partially and totally switching from conventional water to dsw in this section this cost increase is evaluated in relation to the total crop production costs as well as to the expected profit presented in table 5 for the reference scenario the relative value of the increase in the fgc split into wc and fzc with respect to the total production costs for the partial and total replacement scenario is given in fig 5 a in the total replacement scenario the increase in wc ha 1 relative to production costs is far more relevant than in the fzc for all crops ranging from 2 6 in lettuce h to 35 1 in lemon the fzc increase represents less than 1 of the production costs for all the crops except for pepper h 4 4 the aggregation of both into the fgc gives values ranging from 3 2 in lettuce h to 35 5 in lemon these results clearly point to the high price of dsw as being the main cause of the potential economic impact on the farming economy while the fzc increase seems to only economically jeopardize pepper h another interesting observation is the fact that the crops with highest relative impact lemon and melon differ from those with highest absolute impact lettuce h pepper s and pepper h nevertheless the key question still remains unanswered for which crops does the 100 dsw scenario pose a real threat to their profitability this last question is addressed in fig 5b which represents the relevance of the fgc increase split into wc and fzc relative to crop profit we can clearly observe how all crops are negatively affected with important decreases in their profitability 46 2 in lettuce s 24 1 in lettuce h 71 8 in melon 129 1 in lemon 21 6 in pepper s and 48 3 in pepper h the value over 100 for lemon indicates that the production of this crop would cease to be profitable therefore the answer to that question is that the total replacement scenario has a very serious impact on farming profitability deeply affecting traditional crops such as melon and lemon to the point of rendering them economically unviable the prospect for the partial replacement scenario is fortunately very different in this case the increase in the fgc is more than 50 mitigated due to non linearity facts as presented in the previous section the relative relevance of the fgc to the production costs now ranges from 1 45 in lettuce h to 15 71 in lemon the wc increase halves and the fzc effect is almost negligible and even negative for some crops from 1 82 in lemon to 1 45 in pepper h accordingly the relevance of the fgc in relation to crop profit is significantly lower 21 8 in lettuce s 10 9 in lettuce h 33 9 in melon 57 1 in lemon 10 3 in pepper s and 21 1 in pepper h these results indicate although some traditional crops melon and lemon would suffer drastic drops in profitability the farming activity would remain profitable for all crops therefore this confirms that water blending strategies which have been brought up by numerous authors ben gal et al 2009 avni et al 2013 martinez alvarez et al 2016 reca et al 2018 should be carefully studied to mitigate the impact of integrating dsw for irrigation 3 4 economic impact mitigation thus far we have assessed the impact of replacing the conventional water of the study area by dsw the availability of the conventional irrigation water considered here which has a very good quality and price for crops has dramatically decreased during the last decade amid population political and environmental pressure in fact the use of low quality water for irrigation in mediterranean regions is common bortolini et al 2018 especially in regions with increasing water shortages such as se spain and israel where better quality waters are allocated for domestic supply whilst agriculture resorts to marginal waters for that reason the replacement of water available for irrigation with dsw usually implies a noticeable reduction in the ec of the irrigation water and consequently an increase in the quality and quantity of crop yields some examples of these beneficial effects have already been reported for example pérez talavera 1996 and silber et al 2015 reported substantial yield increases and water savings in banana crops in the canary islands and israel respectively in se spain zarzo et al 2013 found that replacing brackish groundwater with dsw increased production by 50 in citrus and valera et al 2018 reported greenhouse yield increases of 44 in tomato and 41 in pepper as well as improvements in the quality of the harvest therefore integrating dsw can potentially boost yield quantity and quality and thereby increase revenue which can offset the increase in the fgc fig 6 displays the required increase in crop revenue to counterbalance the fgc increase for the replacement scenarios of our study case the values for the total replacement scenario were 7 52 in lettuce s 2 83 in lettuce h 16 04 in melon 27 84 in lemon 6 24 in pepper s and 9 33 in pepper h these figures reveal that for lettuce and pepper in both production systems a moderate below 10 revenue increase would suffice to compensate for the additional fgc whereas the most traditional crops melon and lemon would probably struggle to reach compensation once again the prospects look much better for the partial replacement scenario in which the revenue rise for compensation is below 10 except in lemon 12 32 the values obtained for the required increase in crop revenue to counterbalance the production costs increase are in most cases within the range of the results reported by other authors indicating that they can be affordable when low quality irrigation water is managed furthermore the current trend and expectation is that the quality and quantity of water for irrigation continues to decrease thus making dsw a more attractive resource that can help sustain yield and profitability despite its cost the results referring to the revenues and profits should be considered with caution since the variability of the selling price paid to farmers is high fig 6 includes the dispersion range when considering the annual selling price paid to farmers for the last decade 2010 2019 instead of its mean value for that period showing a great uncertainty since annual values can lead to doubling or halving the results for the mean values 4 conclusions this study evaluates to what extent fertigation cost fgc increases pose a threat to farming profitability when integrating dsw for irrigation in se spain we calculated the increase in water and fertilizer costs fgc wc fzc of totally 100 and partially 50 replacing conventional irrigation water with dsw for the most representative crops of the segura basin lettuce and pepper in both soil and hydroponic culture and melon and lemon in soil the results for the total replacement scenario showed that the fgc increase is equivalent to 3 2 35 5 of the crop production costs and to a reduction of crop profitability ranging from 21 6 129 1 this is a considerable loss for all crops and in the case of traditional crops such as lemon it would entail the end of economic viability the main source of the fgc increase lies in the wc increase which is significant for all crops from 1628 ha 1 in lettuce s to 4400 ha 1 in pepper h the fzc increase is relatively low for soil cultivation from 33 ha 1 in lemon to 173 ha 1 in pepper s but relevant for hydroponic cultivation 627 ha 1 in lettuce h and 2670 ha 1 in pepper h moreover for the latter the fertigation programs change significantly and require greater amounts and types of fertilizers as well as equipment upgrades the partial replacement scenario provided a much better outlook since the fgc increase was reduced more than linear the fgc increase represents 1 5 15 7 of the crop production costs and the crop profitability falls by 10 3 57 1 so in this case the farming activity would remain economically feasible for most crops the supra linear decrease comes from the fact that blending water halves the wc increase and reduces the fzc increase by more than half in hydroponic cultivation and can even save some fertilizer costs in soil cultivation this stresses the need for properly evaluating water blending options to maintain profitability the potential agronomic effects on yield and water savings were not considered for the analysis the latter can have both positive and negative impacts and would require careful evaluation for each case using specific crop and site data we do however give an estimation of the required increase in crop revenue positive impact of dsw integration to counterbalance the fgc increase these calculations showed that only lettuce and pepper in both production systems could probably compensate for the total replacement scenario with a moderate increase in revenue this compensation seems far more feasible below 10 increase in revenue for most crops in the 50 dsw scenario once again highlighting the need for water blending strategies from a practical point of view apart from the proposed blending strategies the following recommendations can further help farmers mitigating the economic impacts of integrating dsw firstly as water costs increase the choice of crops can make a real difference in economic sustainably crops with lower water requirements shorter cycles and grown in winter should be prioritized on the contrary long term crops with high investments such as orchards are not advised secondly frequent water quality monitoring would allow optimizing blending strategies and fertigation programs to that end irrigation heads would ideally be equipped with water quality monitoring devices and smart blending systems overall this study aims to improve current knowledge regarding the impact of integrating dsw into irrigated agriculture and provides objective information to steer decision making and address farmers concerns the most relevant piece of information is the demonstration of the benefits of water blending on fertigation costs building on this work we are currently developing a smart fertigation tool that optimizes the on farm blend of dws with other water resources reclaimed water brackish

10561,inefficient and over use of nitrogen fertilizer and irrigation water are the severe issues with adverse economic and environmental impacts in present study the effect of buried straw layer coupled with fertigation was investigated on fruit yield water use efficiency and quality of greenhouse grown tomato for two consecutive years a randomized block design with three factors 1 straw sn no straw and sw with straw burial 2 nitrogen n1 225 kg ha 1 and n2 180 kg ha 1 and 3 irrigation i1 90 and i2 70 of requirement was established the results showed that under lower nitrogen n2 and irrigation levels i2 the tomato yield was increased by 16 5 and 24 7 under buried straw layer treatment swn2i2 when compared to no straw treatment snn2i2 however under higher nitrogen n1 and irrigation levels i1 fruit yield was reduced by 45 8 and 28 6 under buried straw layer treatments swn1i1 when compared to no straw treatment snn1i1 for two years respectively the total soluble solids brix soluble sugar content sugar acid ratio sar and vitamin c vc were all increased under swn2i2 when compared with control treatment snn1i1 during both seasons the 3 way anova indicated that the fruit quality was found more sensitive to buried straw layer and irrigation however swn2i2 treatment increased wue and fue significantly under limited nitrogen and irrigation conditions in addition topsis analysis ranking indicated that swn2i2 has the best fruit quality when compared to control treatment snn1i1 it was concluded that straw burial could alleviate the stress developed by limited

that resulted in degrading the soil environment particularly in southern china where most of the food of the country is produced delang 2017 therefore an appropriate nutrient and water management strategy is a crucial challenge to improve soil quality yield water and fertilizer use efficiency and reduce nutrient runoff luo and li 2018 fertigation is a process by which it is possible to apply the irrigation and fertilization in a precise way the drip fertigation increased tomato yield by 24 8 with improved quality when compared with traditional fertilization zang et al 2015 the tomato fruit yield and vc can be increased up to 46 9 and 61 8 respectively under drip fertigation xing et al 2015 however fertigation needs enough abilities and understanding of vegetables and soil which is deficient in farmer s community in many vegetable producing regions even under fertigation over fertilization and irrigation are still very common a higher application of nitrogen fertilizer might cause subsequent leaching of no3 n ullah et al 2017 and eventually disturb the nitrate contents in tomato fruits wang et al 2015 at the same time greater application of water would necessarily encourage leaching of fertilizers li et al 2018 ullah et al 2017 to meet the higher food demand there is a conflict to recommend the reduced fertilizer quantity as it is reflected as a risk of reduced yield too much fertilization resulted in lowering the efficiency of fertilizer use increased the production costs a higher nutrient loss that caused serious environmental issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and groundwater nitrate contamination in the present circumstances the extra actions are enormously required to reduce fertilizer loss and alleviate the degradation of soil delang 2017 buried straw is an effective practice for disposing of straw as it can provide organic matter to the soil decreases air pollution and serves as a capillary barrier to control salinization in saline lands chen et al 2019 2017 zhao et al 2014 recent researchers have found that the straw burial has additional benefits such as it decreases infiltration fan et al 2012 zhao et al 2014 improves soil organic carbon huo et al 2017 increases crop yield and wue abd el mageed et al 2018 chen et al 2016 the straw burial can increase the water storage capacity of topsoil during irrigation by delaying the infiltration rates zhang et al 2010 water and fertilizer can be detained in the upper root zone above the straw deposit to decrease percolation and fertilizer leaching if the soil moisture is controlled precisely rasool et al 2019b it can also alleviate water logging in the southern part of china where the groundwater table is shallow zhao et al 2016 previous researches have focused on the individual effects of a straw burial or fertigation on crop yield quality and water fertilizer use efficiency and concluded that both have beneficial effects however the combined effects of the straw layer and fertigation on tomato production have rarely been studied assuming that the coupling of straw burial and fertigation could improve fruit yield fruit quality and fertilizer use efficiency to attain the optimum levels of profit we carried out experiments during 2017 and 2018 experimental seasons on tomato under greenhouse conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site descriptions the

kh2po4 and k2so4 were dissolved in irrigation water and fertigation was done in four equal splits along the season table 2 the topsoil was rototilled and the upper 25 cm of soil layer with a width of 30 cm was removed and placed in different positions the air dried and manually chopped 5 8 cm rice straw with c n ratio of 100 1 was uniformly placed to a thickness of about 5 cm 5 kg m 2 and the ridges were raised manually the plant to plant and row to row distance was 50 and 60 cm respectively the total planted area was 36 m2 six week old tomato solanum lycopersicum l var yazhoufenwang seedlings were transplanted uniform seedlings were transplanted in beds with the planting density of 3 33 plants m 2 each bed contained three plants and the total number of beds was 28 the outer two beds from eider side of greenhouse were considered as protection treatments a nylon cord was used for plant vertical support the pruning of the plants was also done by following the local agronomic

growing seasons respectively 2 3 crop water consumption full irrigation was practiced for the first 21 days to safeguard the proper establishments of seedlings and treatments were executed on 22nd day during both experimental seasons the volumetric soil moisture was monitored by a time domain reflectometer tdr with a 4 days interval during both experimental seasons tdr was calibrated for the experimental soil before data collection the moisture deficit obtained from tdr data was divided into two equal parts and the irrigation was done at the frequency of every two days until the harvesting of the crop from the start of irrigation treatments irrigation was done by the gravity drip irrigation bags having 1 5 l water storage capacity a separate irrigation bag was positioned at a height of 1 5 m for irrigation of a single plant and each bag had two emitters buried at a depth of 2 cm on either side of a plant at a distance of 10 cm from the stem of the plant soil water

irrigation and nitrogen levels under the straw burial significantly affected fruit yield during both experimental years in general fruit yield was improved under lower nitrogen n2 and irrigation

highest decrease in fruit yield 48 77 and 36 08 was witnessed in t7 snn1i2 when compared to control treatment t5 snn1i1 control treatment t5 snn1i1 resulted in the highest fruit yield but it amplified the input cost of nitrogen fertilizer and irrigation water though t4 swn2i2 has a reduction in fruit yield but it also lessened the input costs of nitrogen fertilizer and water 3 3 2 water use

the nutritional value of tomato fruit the highest increase 35 18 and 46 17 in vc was observed t4 swn2i2 when compared to t5 snn1i1 for both seasons respectively topsis analysis ranking clearly indicated that t4 swn2i2 has the best fruit quality while t5 snn1i1 resulted in the least quality table 7 4 discussions 4 1 interactive impact of straw and fertigation on irrigation water and soil total nitrogen fruit yield and quality are the main factors to estimate economic returns however simultaneous control of these is generally a tough task due to an inverse relationship between fruit quality and yield a precise irrigation planning is a major influencing component that broadly studies the influences of water stress on the fruit quality and yield as well as water saving capacity deficit irrigation di leads to lower tomato yield jensen et al 2010 under full irrigation twice higher yield could be achieved than that under deficit conditions agami et al 2018 patanè and cosentino 2010 tomato is a water loving crop by decreasing the water applied tomato fruit yield decreases chen et al 2013 ullah et al 2017 however the irrigation water applied in the growing year of 2018 was slightly lesser because of a decrease in evaporation during the 2018 experimental season the concentration of soil total nitrogen tn of top 10 cm soil layer d10 was not affected by the treatment factors i e straw layer nitrogen fertilizer and irrigation water in the experiments conducted on both experimental years whereas the concentration of soil tn was significantly increased under buried straw layer when the middle soil layer d20 was analyzed when compared with the treatments having no straw layer this could be due to the nutrients holding capacity of the straw layer which upheld the nutrients above the straw layer on the other hand the concentration of soil tn in the lower soil profile d30 was decreased drastically under the buried straw layer treatments when compared to the treatments having no straw burial table 3 the reason behind this drastic decrease could be the leaching of nutrients under the treatments having no straw and conversely buried straw held the nutrients in the top soil layer which decreased the possibility of leaching of nutrients in the lower soil layer it has also been confirmed by shindo and nishio 2005 that straw incorporation into soil can help in controlling nitrogen dynamics and reduces nitrogen leaching in soil because straw can improve microbial nitrogen immobilization due to high carbon nitrogen ratio of the materials 4 2 the combined effect of straw and fertigation on yield wues and fue the fruit yield in the experimental season of 2018 was higher than that 2017 experimental season which could be due to a 15 day early transplanting than the previous growing year the highest yield was achieved by t5 snn1i1 during both years but it utilized higher values of irrigation water and nitrogen levels table 4 on the other hand high yield and low water consumption resulted in high water use efficiency under lower irrigation and fertilizer under straw burial t4 swn2i2 similar results have been reported by abd el mageed et al 2016 debashis et al 2008 hou et al 2010 who indicated that higher wues under straw treatments compared to no straw burial reveals its efficiency in improving the plant respiration and reduced soil evaporation thus t4 swn2i2 was the optimum coupled strategy to enhance crop water use efficiency with maintained yield table 4 the possible reason why t4 swn2i2 achieved higher yield is the horizontal distribution of plant roots in t4 which supported higher availability of nutrients in the upper rootzone above the straw similar findings were also described by lv et al 2019 who found that straw return with reduced nitrogen fertilizer will assist in improving crop production and decreasing the input chemical fertilizer in the long run whereas under t6 swn1i1 some of the roots traveled to the lower side of straw which decreased plant nutrient absorption potential as most of the nutrients were sustained above the straw due to the nutrients holding property of straw which ultimately reduced the fruit yield in t6 swn1i1 it is already confirmed by zhao et al 2014 that straw burial can decrease nitrogen leaching loss due to lack of capillary characteristic of straw if the upper layer soil moisture is reduced due to loss of evapotranspiration then the use of straw could overcome the adverse effects of water stress by raising plant water status improving plant growth and efficiencies in water use abd el mageed et al 2018 rasool et al 2019a the increase in nitrogen fertilization decreased tomato yields under lower irrigation water level with no straw treatment t7 these findings showed that enhancing the nitrogen fertilization rate under water deficit condition will be comparatively unproductive because of the adverse effects of excessive nitrogen on crop production el mokh et al 2015 fertilizer use efficiency fue or partial factor productivity of nitrogen fertilizer is the measure which enumerates the output or yield in relation to the application rates of nitrogen and it is calculated as a ratio of crop production and the fertilizer quantity fue was improved by the interactive response of n2 and i2 under the straw burial table 4 when compared with the straw incorporation treatments the improvement of fue might have resulted by the straw characteristics as it can hold fertilizer and water on the top side of the straw layer in the upper root zone and help in reducing soil evaporation and the nutrients leaching mingze et al 2016 rasool et al 2020 zhao et al 2014 4 3 effect of straw and fertigation on fruit quality parameters water deficit helps in ripening the tomatoes and improves reddish color appearance matsuzoe et al 1998 in the present study straw burial with lesser irrigation and fertilizer levels significantly improved the color index and thus gave more red appearance table 5 because the ethylene content of fruit was increased by water stress basiouny et al 1994 the increase in ethylene amplified the concentration of carotenoid in fruit of tomatoes paz et al 1982 hence the i2 fruits had more red color which could be the effect of higher production of ethylene pulupol et al 1996 fruit appearance is the most desired fruit quality attribute by the customers and can be determined by fruit color and shape salunkhe et al 1974 fruit firmness is a critical trait used to determine the storage quality of tomato fruits domis et al 2002 a fruit having higher hardness can withstand tougher mechanical damage which increases storage duration also most buyers choose to buy a firmer tomato kader 1986 sugar contents organic acid and sugar acid ratio are the factors which assess taste quality of tomato fruit the total soluble solids were improved with a lessening amount of water for the same level of nutrients and it is evaluated by many researchers that deficit irrigation increases fruit quality of tomatoes by enhancing total soluble solids kader 2008 stated that compared to the irrigation effect higher nutrient concentration have less effect in increasing the total soluble solids brix there was no significant increase in tss for all the treatments under the higher nitrogen level however at the same level of nitrogen concentration along with low water deficit treatment tss was found significantly higher than t5 snn1i1 under the higher levels of irrigation and nitrogen tss decreased the maximum tss values were recorded by t7 snn1i2 and t8 swn1i2 during both years table 6 the taste quality of tomato fruit is mainly estimated by the contents of an organic acid soluble sugar and the sugar acid ratio domis et al 2002 organic acid significantly increased under i1 treatments and decreased under i2 treatments respectively table 6 a similar trend was recorded for organic acid for tomatoes under deficit irrigation patanè et al 2011 organic acid increased under n2 nitrogen concertation whereas a decrease was noticed under the n1 nitrogen level mahajan and singh 2006 studied growth parameters and the quality of tomato fruit by using different water regimes combined with over fertilization in the greenhouse and recorded a decreasing trend of the organic acid with increasing nitrogen concentration the more exposure of fruit to light the more will be the accumulation of vitamin c vc dumas et al 2003 an improve of vc in i2 combined with the straw layer was noticed in this study while i1 significantly decreased vc table 4 water deficit was proved to increase the vc content in the fruit patanè et al 2011 but there was no apparent evidence that nitrogen could increase vc contents in the tomato fruit it was revealed that the fruit quality was more sensitive to buried straw layer and water than to nutrient concentration wang et al 2015 4 3 1 fruit quality analysis by topsis irrigation scheduling is the central element for managing tomato fruit quality topsis is used to estimate the fruit quality index it was observed that fruit color index total soluble solids soluble sugar and sugar acid ratio significantly affected the overall fruit quality index during both experimental years the analysis ranking showed that t4 swn2i2 has the best fruit quality while t5 snn1i1 resulted in the least quality 5 conclusion the present study showed that fruit yield quality and wue of tomato were all affected by irrigation fertigation and buried straw layer the straw burial has increased tomato yield and improved quality under low irrigation and fertilization while decreased yield under higher irrigation and nitrogen fertilization in t4 swn2i2 the total soluble solids brix soluble sugar content organic acid sugar acid ratio sar and vitamin c vc were all found augmented when compared to control t5 snn1i1 during both seasons the 3 way anova indicated that the fruit quality is more sensitive to buried straw layer and water than nitrogen fertilizer lower irrigation i2 and fertilizer n2 under buried straw decreased the fruit yield by 10 15 but it gave best fruit quality ranking and it also enhanced wue and fue significantly in addition topsis analysis ranking indicated that t4 swn2i2 has the best fruit quality when compared to control treatment t5 snn1i1 it was concluded that straw burial could alleviate the stress developed by limited irrigation water and fertilizer for improving fruit yield and quality in the greenhouse grown tomato the future research

topsis analysis ranking indicated that swn2i2 has the best fruit quality when compared to control treatment snn1i1 it was concluded that straw burial could alleviate the stress developed by limited irrigation water and fertilizer for improving fruit yield and quality in the greenhouse grown tomato keywords fertigation buried straw layer fruit quality water use efficiency fertilizer use efficiency 1 introduction inefficient and overuse of nitrogen fertilizer and irrigation water is a severe concern of china with adversative environment and economic effects zhang et al 2015 even though the nitrogen consumption of china is doubled between 1990 and 2009 its yield has just increased by 22 gong et al 2011 the fertilizer application rates were found higher and beyond the safer limits during the investigations by chinese ministry of agriculture shuqin and fang 2018 china is among the leading countries producing 6 82 of the world s tomatoes production fao 2016 rain shelter cultivation is rapidly increasing in south china as well due to frequent rainfall and shallow water table she et al 2018 tomato growth and fruit yield are intensely affected by two factors such as irrigation water and nutrients but these factors are manageable chen et al 2013 ozbahce and tari 2010 the most of the farmer s communities are still using conventional methods of excessive nutrients and water applications to attain higher production but these activities have reduced the fertilizer use efficiency by increasing nutrients leaching and increased the water pollution zhang et al 2015 that resulted in degrading the soil environment particularly in southern china where most of the food of the country is produced delang 2017 therefore an appropriate nutrient and water management strategy is a crucial challenge to improve soil quality yield water and fertilizer use efficiency and reduce nutrient runoff luo and li 2018 fertigation is a process by which it is possible to apply the irrigation and fertilization in a precise way the drip fertigation increased tomato yield by 24 8 with improved quality when compared with traditional fertilization zang et al 2015 the tomato fruit yield and vc can be increased up to 46 9 and 61 8 respectively under drip fertigation xing et al 2015 however fertigation needs enough abilities and understanding of vegetables and soil which is deficient in farmer s community in many vegetable producing regions even under fertigation over fertilization and irrigation are still very common a higher application of nitrogen fertilizer might cause subsequent leaching of no3 n ullah et al 2017 and eventually disturb the nitrate contents in tomato fruits wang et al 2015 at the same time greater application of water would necessarily encourage leaching of fertilizers li et al 2018 ullah et al 2017 to meet the higher food demand there is a conflict to recommend the reduced fertilizer quantity as it is reflected as a risk of reduced yield too much fertilization resulted in lowering the efficiency of fertilizer use increased the production costs a higher nutrient loss that caused serious environmental issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and groundwater nitrate contamination in the present circumstances the extra actions are enormously required to reduce fertilizer loss and alleviate the degradation of soil delang 2017 buried straw is an effective practice for disposing of straw as it can provide organic matter to the soil decreases air pollution and serves as a capillary barrier to control salinization in saline lands chen et al 2019 2017 zhao et al 2014 recent researchers have found that the straw burial has additional benefits such as it decreases infiltration fan et al 2012 zhao et al 2014 improves soil organic carbon huo et al 2017 increases crop yield and wue abd el mageed et al 2018 chen et al 2016 the straw burial can increase the water storage capacity of topsoil during irrigation by delaying the infiltration rates zhang et al 2010 water and fertilizer can be detained in the upper root zone above the straw deposit to decrease percolation and fertilizer leaching if the soil moisture is controlled precisely rasool et al 2019b it can also alleviate water logging in the southern part of china where the groundwater table is shallow zhao et al 2016 previous researches have focused on the individual effects of a straw burial or fertigation on crop yield quality and water fertilizer use efficiency and concluded that both have beneficial effects however the combined effects of the straw layer and fertigation on tomato production have rarely been studied assuming that the coupling of straw burial and fertigation could improve fruit yield fruit quality and fertilizer use efficiency to attain the optimum levels of profit we carried out experiments during 2017 and 2018 experimental seasons on tomato under greenhouse conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site descriptions the

irrigation and nitrogen levels under the straw burial significantly affected fruit yield during both experimental years in general fruit yield was improved under lower nitrogen n2 and irrigation

highest decrease in fruit yield 48 77 and 36 08 was witnessed in t7 snn1i2 when compared to control treatment t5 snn1i1 control treatment t5 snn1i1 resulted in the highest fruit yield but it amplified the input cost of nitrogen fertilizer and irrigation water though t4 swn2i2 has a reduction in fruit yield but it also lessened the input costs of nitrogen fertilizer and water 3 3 2 water use

the nutritional value of tomato fruit the highest increase 35 18 and 46 17 in vc was observed t4 swn2i2 when compared to t5 snn1i1 for both seasons respectively topsis analysis ranking clearly indicated that t4 swn2i2 has the best fruit quality while t5 snn1i1 resulted in the least quality table 7 4 discussions 4 1 interactive impact of straw and fertigation on irrigation water and soil total nitrogen fruit yield and quality are the main factors to estimate economic returns however simultaneous control of these is generally a tough task due to an inverse relationship between fruit quality and yield a precise irrigation planning is a major influencing component that broadly studies the influences of water stress on the fruit quality and yield as well as water saving capacity deficit irrigation di leads to lower tomato yield jensen et al 2010 under full irrigation twice higher yield could be achieved than that under deficit conditions agami et al 2018 patanè and cosentino 2010 tomato is a water loving crop by decreasing the water applied tomato fruit yield decreases chen et al 2013 ullah et al 2017 however the irrigation water applied in the growing year of 2018 was slightly lesser because of a decrease in evaporation during the 2018 experimental season the concentration of soil total nitrogen tn of top 10 cm soil layer d10 was not affected by the treatment factors i e straw layer nitrogen fertilizer and irrigation water in the experiments conducted on both experimental years whereas the concentration of soil tn was significantly increased under buried straw layer when the middle soil layer d20 was analyzed when compared with the treatments having no straw layer this could be due to the nutrients holding capacity of the straw layer which upheld the nutrients above the straw layer on the other hand the concentration of soil tn in the lower soil profile d30 was decreased drastically under the buried straw layer treatments when compared to the treatments having no straw burial table 3 the reason behind this drastic decrease could be the leaching of nutrients under the treatments having no straw and conversely buried straw held the nutrients in the top soil layer which decreased the possibility of leaching of nutrients in the lower soil layer it has also been confirmed by shindo and nishio 2005 that straw incorporation into soil can help in controlling nitrogen dynamics and reduces nitrogen leaching in soil because straw can improve microbial nitrogen immobilization due to high carbon nitrogen ratio of the materials 4 2 the combined effect of straw and fertigation on yield wues and fue the fruit yield in the experimental season of 2018 was higher than that 2017 experimental season which could be due to a 15 day early transplanting than the previous growing year the highest yield was achieved by t5 snn1i1 during both years but it utilized higher values of irrigation water and nitrogen levels table 4 on the other hand high yield and low water consumption resulted in high water use efficiency under lower irrigation and fertilizer under straw burial t4 swn2i2 similar results have been reported by abd el mageed et al 2016 debashis et al 2008 hou et al 2010 who indicated that higher wues under straw treatments compared to no straw burial reveals its efficiency in improving the plant respiration and reduced soil evaporation thus t4 swn2i2 was the optimum coupled strategy to enhance crop water use efficiency with maintained yield table 4 the possible reason why t4 swn2i2 achieved higher yield is the horizontal distribution of plant roots in t4 which supported higher availability of nutrients in the upper rootzone above the straw similar findings were also described by lv et al 2019 who found that straw return with reduced nitrogen fertilizer will assist in improving crop production and decreasing the input chemical fertilizer in the long run whereas under t6 swn1i1 some of the roots traveled to the lower side of straw which decreased plant nutrient absorption potential as most of the nutrients were sustained above the straw due to the nutrients holding property of straw which ultimately reduced the fruit yield in t6 swn1i1 it is already confirmed by zhao et al 2014 that straw burial can decrease nitrogen leaching loss due to lack of capillary characteristic of straw if the upper layer soil moisture is reduced due to loss of evapotranspiration then the use of straw could overcome the adverse effects of water stress by raising plant water status improving plant growth and efficiencies in water use abd el mageed et al 2018 rasool et al 2019a the increase in nitrogen fertilization decreased tomato yields under lower irrigation water level with no straw treatment t7 these findings showed that enhancing the nitrogen fertilization rate under water deficit condition will be comparatively unproductive because of the adverse effects of excessive nitrogen on crop production el mokh et al 2015 fertilizer use efficiency fue or partial factor productivity of nitrogen fertilizer is the measure which enumerates the output or yield in relation to the application rates of nitrogen and it is calculated as a ratio of crop production and the fertilizer quantity fue was improved by the interactive response of n2 and i2 under the straw burial table 4 when compared with the straw incorporation treatments the improvement of fue might have resulted by the straw characteristics as it can hold fertilizer and water on the top side of the straw layer in the upper root zone and help in reducing soil evaporation and the nutrients leaching mingze et al 2016 rasool et al 2020 zhao et al 2014 4 3 effect of straw and fertigation on fruit quality parameters water deficit helps in ripening the tomatoes and improves reddish color appearance matsuzoe et al 1998 in the present study straw burial with lesser irrigation and fertilizer levels significantly improved the color index and thus gave more red appearance table 5 because the ethylene content of fruit was increased by water stress basiouny et al 1994 the increase in ethylene amplified the concentration of carotenoid in fruit of tomatoes paz et al 1982 hence the i2 fruits had more red color which could be the effect of higher production of ethylene pulupol et al 1996 fruit appearance is the most desired fruit quality attribute by the customers and can be determined by fruit color and shape salunkhe et al 1974 fruit firmness is a critical trait used to determine the storage quality of tomato fruits domis et al 2002 a fruit having higher hardness can withstand tougher mechanical damage which increases storage duration also most buyers choose to buy a firmer tomato kader 1986 sugar contents organic acid and sugar acid ratio are the factors which assess taste quality of tomato fruit the total soluble solids were improved with a lessening amount of water for the same level of nutrients and it is evaluated by many researchers that deficit irrigation increases fruit quality of tomatoes by enhancing total soluble solids kader 2008 stated that compared to the irrigation effect higher nutrient concentration have less effect in increasing the total soluble solids brix there was no significant increase in tss for all the treatments under the higher nitrogen level however at the same level of nitrogen concentration along with low water deficit treatment tss was found significantly higher than t5 snn1i1 under the higher levels of irrigation and nitrogen tss decreased the maximum tss values were recorded by t7 snn1i2 and t8 swn1i2 during both years table 6 the taste quality of tomato fruit is mainly estimated by the contents of an organic acid soluble sugar and the sugar acid ratio domis et al 2002 organic acid significantly increased under i1 treatments and decreased under i2 treatments respectively table 6 a similar trend was recorded for organic acid for tomatoes under deficit irrigation patanè et al 2011 organic acid increased under n2 nitrogen concertation whereas a decrease was noticed under the n1 nitrogen level mahajan and singh 2006 studied growth parameters and the quality of tomato fruit by using different water regimes combined with over fertilization in the greenhouse and recorded a decreasing trend of the organic acid with increasing nitrogen concentration the more exposure of fruit to light the more will be the accumulation of vitamin c vc dumas et al 2003 an improve of vc in i2 combined with the straw layer was noticed in this study while i1 significantly decreased vc table 4 water deficit was proved to increase the vc content in the fruit patanè et al 2011 but there was no apparent evidence that nitrogen could increase vc contents in the tomato fruit it was revealed that the fruit quality was more sensitive to buried straw layer and water than to nutrient concentration wang et al 2015 4 3 1 fruit quality analysis by topsis irrigation scheduling is the central element for managing tomato fruit quality topsis is used to estimate the fruit quality index it was observed that fruit color index total soluble solids soluble sugar and sugar acid ratio significantly affected the overall fruit quality index during both experimental years the analysis ranking showed that t4 swn2i2 has the best fruit quality while t5 snn1i1 resulted in the least quality 5 conclusion the present study showed that fruit yield quality and wue of tomato were all affected by irrigation fertigation and buried straw layer the straw burial has increased tomato yield and improved quality under low irrigation and fertilization while decreased yield under higher irrigation and nitrogen fertilization in t4 swn2i2 the total soluble solids brix soluble sugar content organic acid sugar acid ratio sar and vitamin c vc were all found augmented when compared to control t5 snn1i1 during both seasons the 3 way anova indicated that the fruit quality is more sensitive to buried straw layer and water than nitrogen fertilizer lower irrigation i2 and fertilizer n2 under buried straw decreased the fruit yield by 10 15 but it gave best fruit quality ranking and it also enhanced wue and fue significantly in addition topsis analysis ranking indicated that t4 swn2i2 has the best fruit quality when compared to control treatment t5 snn1i1 it was concluded that straw burial could alleviate the stress developed by limited irrigation water and fertilizer for improving fruit yield and quality in the greenhouse grown tomato the future research should be done to study the behavior of root physiology and morphology under different buried straw depths coupled with fertigation levels declaration of competing interest the work described has not

operation to an automatic control system gave the best results from the nexus indicators perspectives the bayesian network model was used to present a probabilistic approach that could assist managers and decision makers in evaluating the performance of the system based on the nexus perspective for this purpose various configurations of the bayesian network structures were developed based on an export oriented approach and the most appropriate model was determined for the test case the calibration and validation process of the selected configuration approved a high accuracy in fulfilling the objective of the study the developed framework can be employed as a decision support model to prioritize options for modernizing agricultural water distribution systems keywords water distribution modernization automation energy conservation bayesian networks 1 introduction agriculture is one of the sectors that play an essential role in the supply and demand for water food and energy resources by consuming 70 of the world s surface water and groundwater and 30 of the world s energy production flammini et al 2014 therefore improving the management of the agriculture sector can reduce water and energy consumption and produce more food to meet the growing need this study develops a framework to evaluate the performance of the agricultural water distribution systems supplied by the surface water sources from the prospect of water energy food wef nexus the main contribution of the present study is developing a bayesian network to present a systematic performance appraisal model for the distribution system the development of such frameworks has previously concentrated on promoting the demand oriented management of on farm agricultural water systems notably the developed framework is restricted to water distribution systems as a central component of off farm agricultural water management the developed framework can serve as a decision support model to prioritize the modernization alternatives for agricultural water distribution systems it also helps irrigation district managers to ascertain not only the technical implications of developing these systems but also the environmental impacts including reduced over exploitation from aquifers and energy conservation a wide range of supply oriented solutions in water resources management has been adopted with a focus on the identification of new water resources however consecutive droughts periods in arid regions have challenged the probability of timely and proper water supply corresponding to the total agricultural demand therefore demand oriented management strategies have been focused on reducing water losses and demands in the agricultural sector orojloo et al 2018 different studies have been carried out to optimize water consumption at the farm scales by developing pressurized irrigation systems garcía et al 2017 and optimizing model crops inas et al 2017 also modernization renovation and improvement projects have been focused on the demand oriented management of on farm systems however it should be noted that the objective water losses reduction in agricultural water systems will be fulfilled when off farm water distribution and delivery systems provide a reliable adequate timely and flexible irrigation water to the farms burt et al 2013 however studies on the performance of these systems indicate the unsatisfactory performance in delivering an adequate amount of agricultural water to the users hashemy et al 2013 fair distribution of water within the districts shahdany and firoozfar 2017 and considerable losses in the agricultural water distribution system according to an appraisal project carried out by the us bureau of reclamation usbr the average amount of water losses within the water distribution systems is about 35 in the central u s usbr 2005 33 50 in arid regions of iran sepaskhah and salemi 2004 30 in rio grande valley in texas fipps 2005 5 11 per one kilometer of water distribution systems in the center of iran mohammadi et al 2019 30 50 in the studied water distribution system in egypt abu khashaba 2013 25 48 water losses in the panchnadi district in india 3 losses per 1 000 m for concrete covered channels around 2 6 per 100 m for laterals in irrigation districts in turkey akkuzu et al 2007 46 8 and 74 water losses respectively in water distribution systems of the mediterranean farming lands and that of modern irrigation networks built by fao in ethiopia agide et al 2016 the mentioned studies indicate that a considerable loss has been reported with agricultural water distribution systems ranging from 42 to 74 the poor performance of the surface water distribution systems has led to the unlimited extraction of groundwater resources burt et al 2013 although the application of groundwater as a complementary source to the surface water has led to the continuation of agricultural activities groundwater pumping for agricultural use has exerted adverse effects on aquifers located in the area of irrigation networks besides concerns about the high vulnerability of aquifers the adverse effects of groundwater pumping especially for pumping from deep wells includes direct i e wells with diesel engines and indirect i e pumps with electro motors energy consumption in pumping stations that causes increased costs of providing agricultural products due to increased consumption and also high co2 emission karimi et al 2012 therefore it is necessary to modernize surface water distribution systems to reach minimum losses also to diminish these destructive environmental impacts resulted from groundwater over exploitation however one of the main challenges in the implementation of agricultural water distribution systems is the economic justification of these projects davidson and ravi 2019 apart from the environmental damage caused by the use of conventional systems under the conditions that these environmental damages including overexploitation from the aquifers and carbon emissions can economize then the application of the modern distribution systems will be highly prioritized this study attempts to perform a comprehensive study of the direct and indirect advantages of upgrading the surface water distribution systems it is worthy to remind that the developed framework is restricted to off farm agricultural water management accordingly it is assumed that there is no change in the on farm water systems and only the allocation of agricultural water from the surface and groundwater resources is with some modifications the wfe nexus is employed to offer more tangible results associated with the effect of improving surface water distribution accordingly decreasing the volume of water abstracted from the aquifer altering the area under cultivation irrigated by the surface water and the production of the crop and ultimately energy conservation by reducing pumping was assessed for individual surface water distribution systems to evaluate the relationships between water food and energy systems as well as wfen management karnib 2016 examined the quantitative relationships between these systems to calculate the final demand for these resources in lebanon in this study a framework for quantitative evaluation of the water food energy nexus was adopted el gafy 2017 also evaluated and analyzed the wfen relationships in the nile basin in this study he developed the wefni by defining the economic and mass effect nexus relationships the wefni was also calculated for 42 crops in the nile basin the results showed that onions with 0 79 and rice with 0 21 had the highest and lowest values for the wefni taking into account climate change and predicting increased demands for water energy and food resources berardy chester 2017 developed a dynamic model and implemented it by using vensim to investigate water and energy consumption of various crops while taking into account the increase in temperature in arizona in the usa wa el et al 2017 noticed in their study that the relationships and interactions between wef resources had to be understood to manage the wfen effectively they developed an integrated model to investigate the interactions between the wfen on the home scale in dohuk iraq this model used the concept of system dynamics to study 419 households to estimate their wef demands and the quantities of wastewater and organic waste they used the results indicated that lifestyle changes the number of family members and income were the most critical parameters affecting the demand for water food and energy in the research by martinez et al 2018 the wfen relationships were also analyzed using fuzzy cognitive mapping fcm in the region of andalusia their results indicated that water potentials management and climate change were the most important parameters affecting wfe resources management karan et al 2018 investigated the nexus relationships under wet and dry scenarios on a small scale consisting of a family with four members and reported that the energy constitutes a large part of the total system costs in both scenarios and finally chai et al 2020 studied and measured wef and economy society environment nexuses and predicted the same demand for water energy and food in china through bayesian networks the findings revealed that water harvesting and food demand are directly affected respectively by population growth and gross domestic product energy demand was also affected directly by pfrarelopulation growth and indirectly by population growth most of the studies on wfen management have been conducted on national scales in the agriculture sector also on farm research has been done moreover to improve water and energy productivity and food production in addition to upgrading on farm water management using modern irrigation systems it is also necessary to pay attention to off farm water management to address this need this study evaluated the performance of the agricultural water distribution systems taking the wfen perspective into account the use of a probabilistic approach seems to be appropriate and efficient for analyzing the wfen relationships due to the uncertainties and cause and effect relationships that exist in the different parts of the wfen and because of problems such as scarcity ambiguity and uncertainty of the data on wfe moreover the probabilistic approach rarely used in previous studies on analyzing water food energy nexus relationships bayesian networks can be used to conduct probabilistic studies and to accelerate the solution of equations governing water food energy nexus relationships bayesian networks are graphical models in which the combination of graph theory and probability creates various capabilities such as the possibility of network development in cases of incomplete data series the combination of expert opinions and the existing data possibility and ease of updating parameters and conditional probabilities between various parameters the possibility of forward and backward computation sherafatpour et al 2019 high speed lack of any minimums for the data sahoo and jha 2013 graphical representation of cause and effect relationships between the variables and the possibility of integrating different processes in the framework of an intelligent model since bayesian networks have high flexibility in analyzing various engineering and management issues they have been used in multiple research projects in recent years for example pagano et al 2014 examined water transfer canals vulnerabilities in the apulia region using bayesian networks wang et al 2015 evaluated the vulnerability of the water resources in the zhangjiakou basin using bayesian networks anbari et al 2017 used bayesian networks for risk assessment in wastewater collection networks in district 3 of tehran tabesh et al 2018 investigated the impact of non revenue water on the water distribution network in district 4 of tehran that included apparent losses actual losses and unbilled authorized consumption using bayesian networks roozbahani et al 2018 developed a framework based on predicting groundwater levels using bayesian networks to monitor aquifers as well as develop groundwater restoration scenarios in 2019 sherafatpour et al replaced an intelligent bayesian model with a hybrid hydrodynamic model for optimal allocation of agricultural water since it is necessary to improve the performance of water distribution systems in sustainable water management for the agricultural sector performance desirability exhibited by the different types of agrarian water distribution systems was evaluated for the first time in this study with a look at the wfen for this purpose the operational models in the different agricultural water distribution systems introduced in various studies were introduced first these systems were a the traditional method using inoperable fixed weirs b improved manual method c decentralized automatic control method using a proportional integral controller pi and d automatic control method using model predictive controller mpc to implement the assessment approach based on the water food energy nexus and study the behavior of the developed agricultural water distribution systems in terms of the suitability of water consumption energy consumption and food production using surface water the indices of the water food energy nexus were analyzed and studied to have a probabilistic and cause and effect approach for analyzing the water food energy nexus relationships and for accelerating the above mentioned calculations bayesian networks were used for amortization of the estimation process the nexus based evaluation structure developed in this study was used on the rudasht water distribution system located in isfahan province in central iran accordingly the objectives of this study include the following development of mathematical models for the operation of agricultural water distribution systems including conventional systems improved conventional systems and decentralized and centralized automatic control systems extraction of wfe nexus indicators presented in studies associated with agricultural water management development of a smart model for the performance appraisal of agricultural water distribution systems using bayesian network model considering the nexus indicators step 2 implementation of the developed framework including steps 1 2 and 3 in a real test case 2 materials and methods the steps in this research fig 1 can be divided into two sections of 1 analysis of water distribution system and evaluation of the wfen and 2 development of a bayesian network 2 1 study area the methodology presented in this study was implemented on the water distribution system in the rudasht irrigation district located in an arid region in the center of iran the study area selection was conducted based on a set of reasons which created the rudasht irrigation district as the most vulnerable one in iran the reasons behind this selection are i unreliable surface water supply for the district due to water shortages ii increasing social tensions and conflicts due to lack of fairly surface water distribution iii technical failures of the structures including water level regulators and the off takes and the overexploitation by tube wells and the substantial reduction from the aquifer shahdany and firoozfar 2017 khiababi et al 2020 the water distribution system in rudasht located in the zayandehrood basin of isfahan was selected as the site of conducting this research this water distribution system covers about 45 000 hectares of agricultural land rudasht is the last plain to receive water from the zayandehrood river the main canal of the left branch in the water distribution system in northern rudasht with the cultivated area of about 15000 hectares was considered the study canal a 53 day irrigation period was also considered for this research table 1 present the required data hydraulic simulation process for the current operating system of the test case including geometrical and operational information fig 2 shows a schematic view for the spatial distribution of the irrigated units and the location of the off takes secondary and tertiary ones and tube wells it is worth noting that individual information if the tube wells including pumping discharge working hours depth electro motor types has been applied to estimate the energy consumption and the food production supplied by the groundwater resource the yield of different crops in the rudasht water distribution system for 26 agricultural land parcels receiving water from the canal test case is also described in table a in appendix 1 in this study the yield of the rudasht water distribution system is considered as a mean of different crop yield c presented in the table a in appendix 1 this value is used for calculating water food and energy indicator that will explain in continues 2 2 modeling water operational in agricultural water distribution systems in this study four different operational methods of an agricultural water distribution system were developed in order to examine the various techniques of operating systems it was necessary first to develop test calibrated and verified the models the first considered method was the manual method modeled using the hec ras hydrodynamic model the second one is the improved manual procedure selected due to the convenient implementation by the operational team the basis of this method is the possibility of using predicted fluctuations in the water flow entering the canal khiababi et al 2020 the underlying assumption in this method is that the fluctuations in the water flow entering the distribution system can be identified detected and measured at hydrometric stations located upstream of the system in another word due to the improvement of agricultural water distribution methods the delivered surface water compared to the current situation becomes more stable and the process of surface water distribution becomes reliable for farmers therefore due to the more appropriate distribution of surface water groundwater abstraction is reduced therefore the assumption of not increasing the area under cultivation is considered because it is possible to replace groundwater with surface water the necessary changes in the regulation of the off take structures in the studied canal were calculated fig 3 shows a schema of this method the manager of the water distribution system and the operational team is provided with the extents of fluctuations and changed discharge through a telemetric system in this method the current water delivery scheduling is upgraded considering the magnitude of inflow fluctuations entering the head source of the canal the water level surface and discharge of the flow passing the river are continually measured at the hygrometry stations located along the river and upstream of the canal head source the occurrence of water fluctuation is recognized at the station following by comparing discharge flow during the time intervals then all the information is sent to the canal headquarters via a telemetric system then the ditch riders make a new set of adjustments through the main canal considering the upgraded water delivery schedule accordingly water delivery to all off takes reduces or increases equally based on the inflow fluctuations this method is a feasible easy to implement and convenient solution to be employed at different irrigation districts since information related to fluctuation can be easily transmitted from gauging stations along the river considering the wide range of topics related to classical decentralized automatic control systems the proportional integral controller pi hashemy et al 2013 hashemy van overloop 2013 lozano et al 2010 the basics definitions and history of using classical automatic control systems are not mentioned here the proportional integral pi controller is one of the most popular alternatives in canal automation projects this local controller is a coupled configuration of pi equipped by a first order low pass filter van overloop et al 2005 when the control of a set of canal reaches is considered the phenomenon of disturbance amplification occurs this phenomenon happens due to the continuous connection of the canal reaches to each other a proportional integral control with a first order low pass filter is coupled to reduce the amplitude of the measured fluctuations entering the controller the use of this filter is highly recommended in the short or low slope canal reaches van overloop et al 2005 according to the pi control algorithm variations in the discharge passing through the regulating infrastructure can be calculated using equation 1 van overloop et al 2005 1 δ q k k i e k k p e k e k 1 here δ q k shows the extents of changes in the discharge passing through the regulating structure in cm3 s in the current time step e the amount of deviations of the water surface

the system specifications the details of determining this index are given in the reference van overloop et al 2005 the proportionality and integral coefficients k p and k i were calculated based on the approach proposed by schuurmans 1997 for the design of the pi controller the centralized controller employing the mpc system was the fourth operational method of the study mpc has been widely used due to its capabilities in dealing with multiple optimization goals under various types of constraints short and long delays and uncertain variables in a control problem camacho and bordons 2004 in this study the performance of the designed mpc was investigated for both the upstream control approach based on prior notification of demand changes at the off takes and the downstream control where water is taken without previous announcements it is an automatic control system that uses an optimization technique to calculate the controller output variable water surface elevation at the irrigation canal reaches in its design technique the task of the controller is to bring the downstream water surface elevation in each main canal segments to the target water surface elevation by regulating the water level control structure located upstream of each canal reach fig 4 presents the general schema of an mpc controller model in a water system in controlling the water distribution system using the mpc method state space models are used to express the internal model the state space model used in the irrigation canal system can be generally expressed in the form of equation 4 van

controlled variables indices for evaluating water distribution systems such as adequacy dependability and equity indices are resented in equations 6 to 8 it is required to explain that these indicators physically assess the adequacy equity and dependability concepts and do not intend the economic concept adequacy is defined as the capability of water delivery systems to supply the amount

the operational method is poor molden and gates 1990 equity as related to water delivery systems can be defined as the delivery of a fair share of water to users throughout a system 8 p e 1 t t c v r

value is between 0 11 and 0 25 the operational method is suitable and if its value is greater than 0 25 the operational method is poor molden and gates 1990 2 3 performance evaluation of water distribution methods based on wfen the indices of a water delivery wc t b energy consumption ec t c water mass productivity wpro t d energy mass productivity epro t g food mass productivity fpro t and h wefn were used to evaluate the distribution systems based on the nexus perspective the mentioned indices inspired by the research el gafy conducted in 2017 were used for evaluation of the on farm water application systems the indices a to h parameters and the equations are given in table 2 in this study it was assumed that farmers would not increase their agricultural land following improvements in the operational method and that the surface water made available following these improvements would replace groundwater extraction in this way the volume of pumped water v could be calculated using different methods of operation the adequacy index which represents the ratio of the amount of delivered water to the amount of the required water at the intakes was used to calculate the improvement in the wells of the water distribution system the way the adequacy index was used to determine the extent of improvement for each well was as follows the adequacy index for various methods of operation such as manual improved manual pi and mpc methods was calculated considering the modeling described earlier at the location of the main water pond valve fig 2 since the efficiency of water transfer delivery and distribution in water distribution systems vary throughout iran the efficiency of water transfer and distribution was considered to be 65 for conventional water distribution systems and 82 5 for modern water distribution systems abbasi et al 2016 the adequacy index at the location of grade 2 pond valves fig 2 was also calculated for the different methods of operation knowing the adequacy index at the main water and grade 2 pond valve the zoning map of the adequacy index for the four methods of operational manual improved manual proportional integral control or pi and automatic model predictive control of mpc methods was prepared using the idw tool in arc gis in the next step the adequacy index zoning maps for the three operational methods of improved manual decentralized control pi and automatic model predictive control mpc were deducted from the zoning map of the manual operational method in order to specify the extent of improvement in the adequacy index at each point of the water distribution system the difference between the adequacy index zoning map for the various methods of operation and the zoning map of the manual operational method is important since the manual method indicates the existing operational status in the water distribution system finally the extent of adequacy index improvement was determined for each of the wells in the three methods of improved manual local control pi and automatic predictive control mpc in this study in order to obtain the amount of food produced using surface water yc t in order to calculate the food index the area covered by the water distribution system irrigated with surface water was multiplied by the performance of the water distribution system for the cropping pattern c in the water distribution system equations 9 and 10 were used to calculate the area covered by surface water and groundwater irrigation 9 a s a q s q g q s 10 a g a q g q g q s here a is the total area covered by the water distribution system qs the volume of water delivered during the irrigation period and qg the volume of groundwater harvested during the irrigation period for the water distribution system 2 4 the operational test scenarios in this study the values of wfen index were calculated to analyze different methods of distribution of agricultural water for the various operational scenarios multiple discharges at the entrance to the water distribution system both the normal flow and the water shortage scenarios were considered the two common operational scenarios in all the agricultural water distribution systems in other words the operational scenario refers to how water is supplied to the water distribution system normal operating conditions refer to a situation where a sufficient amount of water provides the system s inflow for fulfilling the agricultural demands within the district while water shortage scenarios indicate the circumstances that the system s inflow has insufficient and unstable discharge the various discharges under the two normal flow and water shortage scenarios are shown in table 3 2 5 modeling of the energy food water nexus using bayesian networks after calculating the nexus relationships under the normal flow and the water shortage scenarios for the four operational methods in the water distribution system that is the manual improved manual proportional integral control pi and automatic model predictive control or mpc methods a bayesian model was proposed to evaluate the delivery and distribution methods of the agricultural water with wfen and probabilistic approaches taking into account the parameters effective in assessing the nexus in the water distribution system such as the adequacy dependability and equity indices the cultivated area irrigated using surface water the cultivated area irrigated using groundwater and the amount of food produced using surface water fig 4 bayesian networks are graphical structures that represent the probabilistic relationship among a large number of variables neapolitan 2004 these networks were first introduced in 1988 by pearl a bayesian network is a directed acyclic graph in which the nodes represent variables and the edges of the probabilistic dependencies between them these networks are considered one of the new probabilistic graphical methods that are based on the bayesian theory and have greatly attracted the interest of many researchers in recent years due to their numerous advantages murphy 2001 this rule was first introduced by thomas bayes in the 18th century aguilera et al 2013 if e and f are two assumed events so that p e 0 and p f 0 then 11 p e f p f e p e p f here p e ǀ f is the probability of the occurrence of the e event on

study in order to achieve the most accurate bayesian network structure for calculating the nexus indices the mentioned model was studied and calibrated in six different structures fig 5 the studied structures were selected based on expert opinions calibration and verification of the proposed bayesian structures were carried out using hugin this software has a very good graphical interface for users it supports continuous and discrete nodes using the gaussian distribution the structure is trained in this software using the statistical tests and dependence or independence is obtained employing statistical tests using pc and npc algorithms and the parameters are trained to utilize the em algorithm the performance of the water distribution system in the manual method the improved manual method the decentralized automatic control and the model predictive control mcp method was evaluated first using the adequacy index the wfen indices were then calculated to analyze the water distribution system in the next step the wfen indices were calculated under normal flow and water shortage scenarios finally the generated data were then used to develop a bayesian model for the rapid and probabilistic evaluation of the relationships in the wfen in the water distribution system 3 results and discussion the results of this study are presented in three parts the results of modeling the operation of the agricultural water distribution system the results of evaluating the proposed methods based on the water food energy nexus indices and finally the results of modeling the bayesian networks 3 1 the results of modeling the operational methods in the agricultural water distribution system after modeling the different methods of operation in the rudasht water distribution system the values of the adequacy index at 26 grade 2 intakes located in the rudasht water distribution system were calculated under both the normal flow and the water shortage scenarios the results are summarized in table b in appendix 1 after calculating the values of the adequacy index at the grade 2 intakes it was necessary as was explained in the materials and methods section to calculate the extent of improvement in the adequacy index compared to the manual method for the different operating purposes to calculate the energy index for the modeling the water food energy nexus fig 5 shows the extent of improvement in the adequacy index compared to the manual method in case of upgrading the water distribution system using the various operational methods under both the normal flow and the water shortage scenarios according to fig 5 under the normal flow scenario the extent of improvement in the adequacy index was about 0 to 0 1 in the case of using the improved manual method in the water distribution system which does not amount to a substantial increase in the desirability of the practice of operational in the water distribution system the extents of improvement in the adequacy index for the pi and mpc methods were approximately between 0 2 and 0 5 considering the degree of growth and the manner of distribution of this improvement at the level of the water distribution system we can conclude that under the normal flow scenario the extent of development in the adequacy index was approximately the same in both the pi and the mpc methods however it should be noted that a significant volume of water was saved at the beginning part of the water distribution system in addition to improvement in the water distribution system in the mpc method by regulating water at the entrance of the water distribution system therefore it can be concluded that under the normal flow scenario agricultural water will be distributed more desirably among farmers in the mpc method compared to the other methods in the water shortage scenario upgrading the water distribution system to the improved manual method led to an improvement of zero to 0 1 in the adequacy index this extent of advance does not substantially improve the operational method in the water distribution system upgrading the operational method to the pi method in the upstream and midstream of the water distribution system improved the value of the adequacy index by about 0 7 to 0 8 however the calculated values of the adequacy index downstream of the water distribution system did not show any improvement fig 5 this means that the intakes downstream of the water distribution network receive no water through upgrading the water distribution system to the pi method it is important to note here that unequal water delivery can exacerbate social tensions and make utilization of this method impossible the mpc operational method was then analyzed to evaluate the performance of the rudasht agricultural water distribution system under the water shortage scenario according to fig 5 upgrading the water distribution system to the mpc method of operational raised the value of the adequacy index to about 0 3 although this is not a considerable improvement in the value of the adequacy index this increase is the same throughout the water distribution system fig 6 since water delivery and distribution in low flow conditions must be such that it is delivered to all water beneficiaries the mpc method is more suitable than the other techniques both under the low flow conditions and in normal flow conditions in the next step as shown in fig 6 the extents of improvement in the value of the adequacy index for the wells in the water distribution system were calculated at the level of the water distribution system fig 7 as explained in the materials and methods section the extents of improvement in the value of the adequacy index at each well were calculated to determine the amount of energy consumed for groundwater pumping figs 6 and 7 show the improvement of the adequacy of surface water distribution for using different operating systems i e improved manual operation pi and mpc under normal and water shortage scenarios for instance in the improved manual operation the adequacy of surface water distribution under the normal scenario is between 10 and 30 while in the shortage scenario this amount is less than 20 in all parts of the irrigation district by upgrading the operating system to the decentralized automatic one i e pi system the rate of improvement in agricultural water distribution in the normal scenario will be between 20 and 65 however application of the pi method in shortages scenario led to the district to two separate sections of i the upstream regions with more or less appropriate water distribution 30 to 70 and ii the downstream regions where none of the stakeholders receives any water according to the results employing the centralized control system by using mpc both in the normal scenario and shortage scenario fairly distribution of surface water is provided for the upstream and downstream regions based on the output of the operation modeling fig 6 the rate of reduction of groundwater abstraction is obtained by upgrading the mentioned methods and considering the spatial dispersion of the exploitation wells of fig 7 the energy consumed for groundwater pumping was calculated for the different operational methods such as 1 the manual 2 the improved manual 3 the pi and 4 the mpc methods based on which the value of the energy index obtained to evaluate the obtained nexus the results are presented below 3 2 values of the water food energy nexus indices since this study focuses on off farm focus the link between energy and food components concerning any improvement of surface water distribution within the district in other words the energy and food components come into play in the modeling by any changes in water allocation from surface and groundwater resources the improvement of surface water distribution led to a reliable water supply for the stakeholders i e farmers representatives for each region spatial analysis of the operational results fig 6 determines the regions with a reliable water supply and the distributed surface water is replaced by the groundwater extraction by changing the cultivation area supplied by the surface water resource the amount of food using food productivity fpro t index was determined separately for the surface and groundwater resources moreover the energy conservations due to decreasing groundwater abstraction are also computed for individual tube wells through the energy consumption ec t indicator accordingly different operating systems due to the inherent capability of the systems inefficient water distribution represent different feed backs in food and energy components of the surface and groundwater resources it is worth noting that as mentioned earlier any changes in on farm scale systems irrigation ones in the farms to agricultural systems were prevented for precise evaluation of the water distribution systems the ranges of changes in the values of the water food energy nexus under the normal flow and the water shortage scenarios for the four operations methods in the water distribution system 1 the existing operational method 2 the improved manual operational method 3 the decentralized automatic control method pi and 4 the model predictive control mpc method are presented in tables 4 and 5 according to table 4 under the normal flow scenario the ranges of changes in the values of the wfeni in case of using the manual operational method in the water distribution system operational were 46 49 56 70 36 51 and 47 53 respectively in the case of using the improved manual operational method in the water distribution system the values of the wefni were 35 52 61 71 41 53 and 51 55 respectively in the case of using the pi operational method in the water distribution system the values of the wfeni were 30 60 83 100 68 100 and 60 86 respectively finally by upgrading the water distribution by using the mpc method the values of the wfeni were 60 100 86 100 68 100 and 80 86 respectively therefore based on the values of the obtained index we can conclude that the mpc method performed better than the other methods in terms of the water food energy nexus in the water shortage scenario also as shown in table 5 the ranges of changes in the calculated values of the wfeni in the case of the manual operational method in the water distribution system were 0 49 0 21 0 11 and 0 27 respectively if the improved manual operational method was employed in the water distribution system the values of wfeni were 0 61 0 23 1 12 and 2 28 respectively in the case of employing the pi operational method in the water distribution system the values of the wfeni were 0 58 9 59 4 37 and 23 51 respectively finally by upgrading the operating system by using the mpc method in the water distribution system the values of the wfeni were 42 66 6 57 3 36 and 18 45 respectively the results obtained under the water shortage scenario showed that by improving the operational method in the distribution system to the pi method the values of the wfeni were more suitable than those of the mpc method however the value of the water index calculated to be between 66 42 using the mpc method showed more desirability than the pi method moreover the range of fluctuations in the value of the water index in the mpc method was narrower than that in the pi method this in itself suggested that water was delivered to all the intakes in the mpc method because of the above it is suggested that the water food energy nexus index be calculated downstream midstream and upstream of the water distribution systems because it can give managers and decision makers a more accurate idea of the status of the water distribution system in the low flow conditions by summing up the obtained results it can be declared that in the normal flow scenario the value of the water index increased by upgrading the water distribution system from manual to improved manual pi and mpc methods the most desirable status of the water index was associated with mpc method with the improvement of the operating system the values of the food and energy indices also improved like that of the water index did however no significant difference was found between the pi and mpc in these two indices as for the wfeni the values of 47 53 51 55 60 86 and 80 86 percent were obtained respectively after upgrading the water distribution system to the manual improved manual pi and mpc methods finally taking into account the results we can conclude that the mpc operational method performed better than the other ways in terms of the water food energy nexus under the normal flow scenario after upgrading the water distribution system to the manual improved manual pi and mpc methods the trend of changes in the nexus index under the water shortage scenario was different from that under the normal flow scenario the mpc method had a higher value for the water index than the other methods but the values for the food and energy indices and the wfeni were higher compared to the other operational methods when the water distribution system was upgraded to the pi method it is important to note here that in the pi method the downstream of the water distribution system did not benefit from upgrading the water distribution system and only the upstream of the water distribution system did therefore it is recommended to split the water distribution system into the three upstream midstream and downstream segments for more appropriate analysis of the water food energy nexus index and calculate the nexus indices for these three segments 3 3 results of bayesian network modeling in order to analyze and investigate the interactions uncertainties and cause effect relationships in the water food energy nexus a bayesian model was developed in this study to calculate the water food energy nexus index the proposed bayesian model structures for the water food energy nexus analysis introduced in the materials and methods section were calibrated and verified using hugin in order to select the best structure among the six selected bayesian models the two metrics of the mean absolute percentage error mape and the root mean square error rmse were used the calibration and verification results in terms of comparison between model outputs and reference values calculated by equations in table 2 for the six proposed structures are presented in table 6 the calibration results indicated that the sixth structure with ave mape 6 35 mape for wfeni 9 95 and rmse for wfeni 5 16 was better than the other five structures the verification results also showed that the sixth structure with ave mape 7 87 mape for wfeni 9 65 and rmse for wfeni 7 69 was more accurate than the other five structures therefore the sixth structure was chosen to analyze the water food energy nexus after selecting the best structure in the bayesian model the details of the accuracy of each node in the best structure were presented in table 7 in order to evaluate more accurately the performance of the model a 45 diagram was presented for all the nodes calculated by the model in the verification section fig 8 based on the model verification results and the 45 degree diagrams it can be concluded that the superior structure performed well and could be used to evaluate the water food energy nexus by taking into account the probabilities and cause effect relationships in the water distribution system 4 conclusion the comprehensive evaluation framework proposed in this study can be applied as a decision support model to prioritize the operating systems included in modernization innovation and improvement projects of irrigation districts this evaluation framework will help local managers to investigate environmental impacts including reducing over exploitation from the aquifer and consequently reducing energy consumption in the area and the technical consequences of upgrading the agricultural water distribution system this framework would be more effective in developed countries where the private sector manages the irrigation districts this is important from two main perspectives i considering the importance of maintaining agricultural activities in water shortage periods and achieving the intended economic goals because reduced losses in agricultural water distribution systems can compensate for a large part of water allocated to the irrigation district ii any improvement of irrigation systems within the farms must be consistent with the capabilities of the water distribution system within the district to maximize the level of physical and economic productivity of water at the farm it is worth noting that the framework developed in this study can be employed to upgrade the main water distribution system i e the main canal due to the limitations of the budget in the districts and the impossibility of significant investment in this sector in other words upgrading the main and lateral water distribution systems with modern methods automatic control is only feasible when its implementation is economically justifiable this will achieve when the price of surface water distributed is equal to the economic value of water so that modern agricultural systems precision agriculture are accessible for all in farm activities along with a fully automatic distribution system this limitation made it one of the most severe challenges for the researchers to determine the level of impact of the optimal distribution of agricultural water supplied from surface water resources accordingly the lateral distribution system a canal network that receives water from the main system and conveys it to the individual farms was modeled based on the current manual operation the method is based on an up down management approach and acts by manually adjusting the off takes according to a scheduled water delivery programming in other words the conventional operation of water distribution in the lateral network significantly affected the optimal performance of the automatic control system in the main system the development of an automatic control model for the lateral system and examining the performance of the full automatic system from reservoirs to farms are therefore main suggestions for future research so that the real impact of using automatic control systems on the exploitation of agricultural water distribution systems can be measured it is thus recommended to develop a comprehensive framework for evaluating agricultural water management including water distribution and application by developing the mathematical model of water application systems on the farm scale i e surface irrigation and pressurized irrigation methods and linking it to the distribution system the development of an evaluating framework based on the wfe nexus and including economic discussion as well as presenting a wfe nexus framework is another topic that needs to be covered given the dominance of a technical attitude in this research the application of agricultural economics models e g the positive mathematical planning model pmp with the developed evaluation framework makes it feasible to investigate the reactions of farmers about promoting agricultural water distribution systems such a reaction appears typically during the change in cultivation pattern i e under a constant level of cultivation and variable density of cultivation of different crops and exerts its impact on food and economy also the application of agricultural economics models makes it possible to measure the improvement of water distribution systems from the attitude of sustainable development considering

10562,this study proposes a performance appraisal framework for agricultural water distribution systems based on the water food energy nexus perspective to analyze and evaluate agricultural water distribution systems with this framework various methods of improving the operational management were developed and tested under the conventional and water shortages in operational scenarios the water food energy nexus indicators were then calculated for performance appraisal of the water distribution systems in a study area located in central iran the results indicated that by upgrading the manual operation to an automatic control system gave the best results from the nexus indicators perspectives the bayesian network model was used to present a probabilistic approach that could assist managers and decision makers in evaluating the performance of the system based on the nexus perspective for this purpose various configurations of the bayesian network structures were developed based on an export oriented approach and the most appropriate model was determined for the test case the calibration and validation process of the selected configuration approved a high accuracy in fulfilling the objective of the study the developed framework can be employed as a decision support model to prioritize options for modernizing agricultural water distribution systems keywords water distribution modernization automation energy conservation bayesian networks 1 introduction agriculture is one of the sectors that play an essential role in the supply and demand for water food and energy resources by consuming 70 of the world s surface water and groundwater and 30 of the world s energy production flammini et al 2014 therefore improving the management of the agriculture sector can reduce water and energy consumption and produce more food to meet the growing need this study develops a framework to evaluate the performance of the agricultural water distribution systems supplied by the surface water sources from the prospect of water energy food wef nexus the main contribution of the present study is developing a bayesian network to present a systematic performance appraisal model for the distribution system the development of such frameworks has previously concentrated on promoting the demand oriented management of on farm agricultural water systems notably the developed framework is restricted to water distribution systems as a central component of off farm agricultural water management the developed framework can serve as a decision support model to prioritize the modernization alternatives for agricultural water distribution systems it also helps irrigation district managers to ascertain not only the technical implications of developing these systems but also the environmental impacts including reduced over exploitation from aquifers and energy conservation a wide range of supply oriented solutions in water resources management has been adopted with a focus on the identification of new water resources however consecutive droughts periods in arid regions have challenged the probability of timely and proper water supply corresponding to the total agricultural demand therefore demand oriented management strategies have been focused on reducing water losses and demands in the agricultural sector orojloo et al 2018 different studies have been carried out to optimize water consumption at the farm scales by developing pressurized irrigation systems garcía et al 2017 and optimizing model crops inas et al 2017 also modernization renovation and improvement projects have been focused on the demand oriented management of on farm systems however it should be noted that the objective water losses reduction in agricultural water systems will be fulfilled when off farm water distribution and delivery systems provide a reliable adequate timely and flexible irrigation water to the farms burt et al 2013 however studies on the performance of these systems indicate the unsatisfactory performance in delivering an adequate amount of agricultural water to the users hashemy et al 2013 fair distribution of water within the districts shahdany and firoozfar 2017 and considerable losses in the agricultural water distribution system according to an appraisal project carried out by the us bureau of reclamation usbr the average amount of water losses within the water distribution systems is about 35 in the central u s usbr 2005 33 50 in arid regions of iran sepaskhah and salemi 2004 30 in rio grande valley in texas fipps 2005 5 11 per one kilometer of water distribution systems in the center of iran mohammadi et al 2019 30 50 in the studied water distribution system in egypt abu khashaba 2013 25 48 water losses in the panchnadi district in india 3 losses per 1 000 m for concrete covered channels around 2 6 per 100 m for laterals in irrigation districts in turkey akkuzu et al 2007 46 8 and 74 water losses respectively in water distribution systems of the mediterranean farming lands and that of modern irrigation networks built by fao in ethiopia agide et al 2016 the mentioned studies indicate that a considerable loss has been reported with agricultural water distribution systems ranging from 42 to 74 the poor performance of the surface water distribution systems has led to the unlimited extraction of groundwater resources burt et al 2013 although the application of groundwater as a complementary source to the surface water has led to the continuation of agricultural activities groundwater pumping for agricultural use has exerted adverse effects on aquifers located in the area of irrigation networks besides concerns about the high vulnerability of aquifers the adverse effects of groundwater pumping especially for pumping from deep wells includes direct i e wells with diesel engines and indirect i e pumps with electro motors energy consumption in pumping stations that causes increased costs of providing agricultural products due to increased consumption and also high co2 emission karimi et al 2012 therefore it is necessary to modernize surface water distribution systems to reach minimum losses also to diminish these destructive environmental impacts resulted from groundwater over exploitation however one of the main challenges in the implementation of agricultural water distribution systems is the economic justification of these projects davidson and ravi 2019 apart from the environmental damage caused by the use of conventional systems under the conditions that these environmental damages including overexploitation from the aquifers and carbon emissions can economize then the application of the modern distribution systems will be highly prioritized this study attempts to perform a comprehensive study of the direct and indirect advantages of upgrading the surface water distribution systems it is worthy to remind that the developed framework is restricted to off farm agricultural water management accordingly it is assumed that there is no change in the on farm water systems and only the allocation of agricultural water from the surface and groundwater resources is with some modifications the wfe nexus is employed to offer more tangible results associated with the effect of improving surface water distribution accordingly decreasing the volume of water abstracted from the aquifer altering the area under cultivation irrigated by the surface water and the production of the crop and ultimately energy conservation by reducing pumping was assessed for individual surface water distribution systems to evaluate the relationships between water food and energy systems as well as wfen management karnib 2016 examined the quantitative relationships between these systems to calculate the final demand for these resources in lebanon in this study a framework for quantitative evaluation of the water food energy nexus was adopted el gafy 2017 also evaluated and analyzed the wfen relationships in the nile basin in this study he developed the wefni by defining the economic and mass effect nexus relationships the wefni was also calculated for 42 crops in the nile basin the results showed that onions with 0 79 and rice with 0 21 had the highest and lowest values for the wefni taking into account climate change and predicting increased demands for water energy and food resources berardy chester 2017 developed a dynamic model and implemented it by using vensim to investigate water and energy consumption of various crops while taking into account the increase in temperature in arizona in the usa wa el et al 2017 noticed in their study that the relationships and interactions between wef resources had to be understood to manage the wfen effectively they developed an integrated model to investigate the interactions between the wfen on the home scale in dohuk iraq this model used the concept of system dynamics to study 419 households to estimate their wef demands and the quantities of wastewater and organic waste they used the results indicated that lifestyle changes the number of family members and income were the most critical parameters affecting the demand for water food and energy in the research by martinez et al 2018 the wfen relationships were also analyzed using fuzzy cognitive mapping fcm in the region of andalusia their results indicated that water potentials management and climate change were the most important parameters affecting wfe resources management karan et al 2018 investigated the nexus relationships under wet and dry scenarios on a small scale consisting of a family with four members and reported that the energy constitutes a large part of the total system costs in both scenarios and finally chai et al 2020 studied and measured wef and economy society environment nexuses and predicted the same demand for water energy and food in china through bayesian networks the findings revealed that water harvesting and food demand are directly affected respectively by population growth and gross domestic product energy demand was also affected directly by pfrarelopulation growth and indirectly by population growth most of the studies on wfen management have been conducted on national scales in the agriculture sector also on farm research has been done moreover to improve water and energy productivity and food production in addition to upgrading on farm water management using modern irrigation systems it is also necessary to pay attention to off farm water management to address this need this study evaluated the performance of the agricultural water distribution systems taking the wfen perspective into account the use of a probabilistic approach seems to be appropriate and efficient for analyzing the wfen relationships due to the uncertainties and cause and effect relationships that exist in the different parts of the wfen and because of problems such as scarcity ambiguity and uncertainty of the data on wfe moreover the probabilistic approach rarely used in previous studies on analyzing water food energy nexus relationships bayesian networks can be used to conduct probabilistic studies and to accelerate the solution of equations governing water food energy nexus relationships bayesian networks are graphical models in which the combination of graph theory and probability creates various capabilities such as the possibility of network development in cases of incomplete data series the combination of expert opinions and the existing data possibility and ease of updating parameters and conditional probabilities between various parameters the possibility of forward and backward computation sherafatpour et al 2019 high speed lack of any minimums for the data sahoo and jha 2013 graphical representation of cause and effect relationships between the variables and the possibility of integrating different processes in the framework of an intelligent model since bayesian networks have high flexibility in analyzing various engineering and management issues they have been used in multiple research projects in recent years for example pagano et al 2014 examined water transfer canals vulnerabilities in the apulia region using bayesian networks wang et al 2015 evaluated the vulnerability of the water resources in the zhangjiakou basin using bayesian networks anbari et al 2017 used bayesian networks for risk assessment in wastewater collection networks in district 3 of tehran tabesh et al 2018 investigated the impact of non revenue water on the water distribution network in district 4 of tehran that included apparent losses actual losses and unbilled authorized consumption using bayesian networks roozbahani et al 2018 developed a framework based on predicting groundwater levels using bayesian networks to monitor aquifers as well as develop groundwater restoration scenarios in 2019 sherafatpour et al replaced an intelligent bayesian model with a hybrid hydrodynamic model for optimal allocation of agricultural water since it is necessary to improve the performance of water distribution systems in sustainable water management for the agricultural sector performance desirability exhibited by the different types of agrarian water distribution systems was evaluated for the first time in this study with a look at the wfen for this purpose the operational models in the different agricultural water distribution systems introduced in various studies were introduced first these systems were a the traditional method using inoperable fixed weirs b improved manual method c decentralized automatic control method using a proportional integral controller pi and d automatic control method using model predictive controller mpc to implement the assessment approach based on the water food energy nexus and study the behavior of the developed agricultural water distribution systems in terms of the suitability of water consumption energy consumption and food production using surface water the indices of the water food energy nexus were analyzed and studied to have a probabilistic and cause and effect approach for analyzing the water food energy nexus relationships and for accelerating the above mentioned calculations bayesian networks were used for amortization of the estimation process the nexus based evaluation structure developed in this study was used on the rudasht water distribution system located in isfahan province in central iran accordingly the objectives of this study include the following development of mathematical models for the operation of agricultural water distribution systems including conventional systems improved conventional systems and decentralized and centralized automatic control systems extraction of wfe nexus indicators presented in studies associated with agricultural water management development of a smart model for the performance appraisal of agricultural water distribution systems using bayesian network model considering the nexus indicators step 2 implementation of the developed framework including steps 1 2 and 3 in a real test case 2 materials and methods the steps in this research fig 1 can be divided into two sections of 1 analysis of water distribution system and evaluation of the wfen and 2 development of a bayesian network 2 1 study area the methodology presented in this study was implemented on the water distribution system in the rudasht irrigation district located in an arid region in the center of iran the study area selection was conducted based on a set of reasons which created the rudasht irrigation district as the most vulnerable one in iran the reasons behind this selection are i unreliable surface water supply for the district due to water shortages ii increasing social tensions and conflicts due to lack of fairly surface water distribution iii technical failures of the structures including water level regulators and the off takes and the overexploitation by tube wells and the substantial reduction from the aquifer shahdany and firoozfar 2017 khiababi et al 2020 the water distribution system in rudasht located in the zayandehrood basin of isfahan was selected as the site of conducting this research this water distribution system covers about 45 000 hectares of agricultural land rudasht is the last plain to receive water from the zayandehrood river the main canal of the left branch in the water distribution system in northern rudasht with the cultivated area of about 15000 hectares was considered the study canal a 53 day irrigation period was also considered for this research table 1 present the required data hydraulic simulation process for the current operating system of the test case including geometrical and operational information fig 2 shows a schematic view for the spatial distribution of the irrigated units and the location of the off takes secondary and tertiary ones and tube wells it is worth noting that individual information if the tube wells including pumping discharge working hours depth electro motor types has been applied to estimate the energy consumption and the food production supplied by the groundwater resource the yield of different crops in the rudasht water distribution system for 26 agricultural land parcels receiving water from the canal test case is also described in table a in appendix 1 in this study the yield of the rudasht water distribution system is considered as a mean of different crop yield c presented in the table a in appendix 1 this value is used for calculating water food and energy indicator that will explain in continues 2 2 modeling water operational in agricultural water distribution systems in this study four different operational methods of an agricultural water distribution system were developed in order to examine the various techniques of operating systems it was necessary first to develop test calibrated and verified the models the first considered method was the manual method modeled using the hec ras hydrodynamic model the second one is the improved manual procedure selected due to the convenient implementation by the operational team the basis of this method is the possibility of using predicted fluctuations in the water flow entering the canal khiababi et al 2020 the underlying assumption in this method is that the fluctuations in the water flow entering the distribution system can be identified detected and measured at hydrometric stations located upstream of the system in another word due to the improvement of agricultural water distribution methods the delivered surface water compared to the current situation becomes more stable and the process of surface water distribution becomes reliable for farmers therefore due to the more appropriate distribution of surface water groundwater abstraction is reduced therefore the assumption of not increasing the area under cultivation is considered because it is possible to replace groundwater with surface water the necessary changes in the regulation of the off take structures in the studied canal were calculated fig 3 shows a schema of this method the manager of the water distribution system and the operational team is provided with the extents of fluctuations and changed discharge through a telemetric system in this method the current water delivery scheduling is upgraded considering the magnitude of inflow fluctuations entering the head source of the canal the water level surface and discharge of the flow passing the river are continually measured at the hygrometry stations located along the river and upstream of the canal head source the occurrence of water fluctuation is recognized at the station following by comparing discharge flow during the time intervals then all the information is sent to the canal headquarters via a telemetric system then the ditch riders make a new set of adjustments through the main canal considering the upgraded water delivery schedule accordingly water delivery to all off takes reduces or increases equally based on the inflow fluctuations this method is a feasible easy to implement and convenient solution to be employed at different irrigation districts since information related to fluctuation can be easily transmitted from gauging stations along the river considering the wide range of topics related to classical decentralized automatic control systems the proportional integral controller pi hashemy et al 2013 hashemy van overloop 2013 lozano et al 2010 the basics definitions and history of using classical automatic control systems are not mentioned here the proportional integral pi controller is one of the most popular alternatives in canal automation projects this local controller is a coupled configuration of pi equipped by a first order low pass filter van overloop et al 2005 when the control of a set of canal reaches is considered the phenomenon of disturbance amplification occurs this phenomenon happens due to the continuous connection of the canal reaches to each other a proportional integral control with a first order low pass filter is coupled to reduce the amplitude of the measured fluctuations entering the controller the use of this filter is highly recommended in the short or low slope canal reaches van overloop et al 2005 according to the pi control algorithm variations in the discharge passing through the regulating infrastructure can be calculated using equation 1 van overloop et al 2005 1 δ q k k i e k k p e k e k 1 here δ q k shows the extents of changes in the discharge passing through the regulating structure in cm3 s in the current time step e the amount of deviations of the water surface level from the target water surface elevations the k and k 1 indices the current time step and the previous one respectively k p the coefficient of proportionality and k i the integral coefficient using the first order low pass filter to prevent resonance phenomenon horváth et al 2015 the extent of variation in discharge passing through the regulating structures is calculated by using equation

the system specifications the details of determining this index are given in the reference van overloop et al 2005 the proportionality and integral coefficients k p and k i were calculated based on the approach proposed by schuurmans 1997 for the design of the pi controller the centralized controller employing the mpc system was the fourth operational method of the study mpc has been widely used due to its capabilities in dealing with multiple optimization goals under various types of constraints short and long delays and uncertain variables in a control problem camacho and bordons 2004 in this study the performance of the designed mpc was investigated for both the upstream control approach based on prior notification of demand changes at the off takes and the downstream control where water is taken without previous announcements it is an automatic control system that uses an optimization technique to calculate the controller output variable water surface elevation at the irrigation canal reaches in its design technique the task of the controller is to bring the downstream water surface elevation in each main canal segments to the target water surface elevation by regulating the water level control structure located upstream of each canal reach fig 4 presents the general schema of an mpc controller model in a water system in controlling the water distribution system using the mpc method state space models are used to express the internal model the state space model used in the irrigation canal system can be generally expressed in the form of equation 4 van

controlled variables indices for evaluating water distribution systems such as adequacy dependability and equity indices are resented in equations 6 to 8 it is required to explain that these indicators physically assess the adequacy equity and dependability concepts and do not intend the economic concept adequacy is defined as the capability of water delivery systems to supply the amount

the measured intakes qd the delivered discharge and qr the required discharge if the value of the water delivery adequacy index is between 0 9 and 1 the operational method is good if its value is between 0 8 and 0 89 the operational method is suitable and if its value is less than 0 8 the operational method is poor molden and gates 1990 dependability is defined as temporal uniformity of the

the operational method is poor molden and gates 1990 equity as related to water delivery systems can be defined as the delivery of a fair share of water to users throughout a system 8 p e 1 t t c v r

period t respectively and cvr the coefficient of variation ratio along the length of the canal if the value of the index for delivery equity is between 0 and 0 1 the operational method is good if its value is between 0 11 and 0 25 the operational method is suitable and if its value is greater than 0 25 the operational method is poor molden and gates 1990 2 3 performance evaluation of water distribution methods based on wfen the indices of a water delivery wc t b energy consumption ec t c water mass productivity wpro t d energy mass productivity epro t g food mass productivity fpro t and h wefn were used to evaluate the distribution systems based on the nexus perspective the mentioned indices inspired by the research el gafy conducted in 2017 were used for evaluation of the on farm water application systems the indices a to h parameters and the equations are given in table 2 in this study it was assumed that farmers would not increase their agricultural land following improvements in the operational method and that the surface water made available following these improvements would replace groundwater extraction in this way the volume of pumped water v could be calculated using different methods of operation the adequacy index which represents the ratio of the amount of delivered water to the amount of the required water at the intakes was used to calculate the improvement in the wells of the water distribution system the way the adequacy index was used to determine the extent of improvement for each well was as follows the adequacy index for various methods of operation such as manual improved manual pi and mpc methods was calculated considering the modeling described earlier at the location of the main water pond valve fig 2 since the efficiency of water transfer delivery and distribution in water distribution systems vary throughout iran the efficiency of water transfer and distribution was considered to be 65 for conventional water distribution systems and 82 5 for modern water distribution systems abbasi et al 2016 the adequacy index at the location of grade 2 pond valves fig 2 was also calculated for the different methods of operation knowing the adequacy index at the main water and grade 2 pond valve the zoning map of the adequacy index for the four methods of operational manual improved manual proportional integral control or pi and automatic model predictive control of mpc methods was prepared using the idw tool in arc gis in the next step the adequacy index zoning maps for the three operational methods of improved manual decentralized control pi and automatic model predictive control mpc were deducted from the zoning map of the manual operational method in order to specify the extent of improvement in the adequacy index at each point of the water distribution system the difference between the adequacy index zoning map for the various methods of operation and the zoning map of the manual operational method is important since the manual method indicates the existing operational status in the water distribution system finally the extent of adequacy index improvement was determined for each of the wells in the three methods of improved manual local control pi and automatic predictive control mpc in this study in order to obtain the amount of food produced using surface water yc t in order to calculate the food index the area covered by the water distribution system irrigated with surface water was multiplied by the performance of the water distribution system for the cropping pattern c in the water distribution system equations 9 and 10 were used to calculate the area covered by surface water and groundwater irrigation 9 a s a q s q g q s 10 a g a q g q g q s here a is the total area covered by the water distribution system qs the volume of water delivered during the irrigation period and qg the volume of groundwater harvested during the irrigation period for the water distribution system 2 4 the operational test scenarios in this study the values of wfen index were calculated to analyze different methods of distribution of agricultural water for the various operational scenarios multiple discharges at the entrance to the water distribution system both the normal flow and the water shortage scenarios were considered the two common operational scenarios in all the agricultural water distribution systems in other words the operational scenario refers to how water is supplied to the water distribution system normal operating conditions refer to a situation where a sufficient amount of water provides the system s inflow for fulfilling the agricultural demands within the district while water shortage scenarios indicate the circumstances that the system s inflow has insufficient and unstable discharge the various discharges under the two normal flow and water shortage scenarios are shown in table 3 2 5 modeling of the energy food water nexus using bayesian networks after calculating the nexus relationships under the normal flow and the water shortage scenarios for the four operational methods in the water distribution system that is the manual improved manual proportional integral control pi and automatic model predictive control or mpc methods a bayesian model was proposed to evaluate the delivery and distribution methods of the agricultural water with wfen and probabilistic approaches taking into account the parameters effective in assessing the nexus in the water distribution system such as the adequacy dependability and equity indices the cultivated area irrigated using surface water the cultivated area irrigated using groundwater and the amount of food produced using surface water fig 4 bayesian networks are graphical structures that represent the probabilistic relationship among a large number of variables neapolitan 2004 these networks were first introduced in 1988 by pearl a bayesian network is a directed acyclic graph in which the nodes represent variables and the edges of the probabilistic dependencies between them these networks are considered one of the new probabilistic graphical methods that are based on the bayesian theory and have greatly attracted the interest of many researchers in recent years due to their numerous advantages murphy 2001 this rule was first introduced by thomas bayes in the 18th century aguilera et al 2013 if e and f are two assumed events so that p e 0 and p f 0 then 11 p e f p f e p e p f here p e ǀ f is the probability of the occurrence of the e event on

study in order to achieve the most accurate bayesian network structure for calculating the nexus indices the mentioned model was studied and calibrated in six different structures fig 5 the studied structures were selected based on expert opinions calibration and verification of the proposed bayesian structures were carried out using hugin this software has a very good graphical interface for users it supports continuous and discrete nodes using the gaussian distribution the structure is trained in this software using the statistical tests and dependence or independence is obtained employing statistical tests using pc and npc algorithms and the parameters are trained to utilize the em algorithm the performance of the water distribution system in the manual method the improved manual method the decentralized automatic control and the model predictive control mcp method was evaluated first using the adequacy index the wfen indices were then calculated to analyze the water distribution system in the next step the wfen indices were calculated under normal flow and water shortage scenarios finally the generated data were then used to develop a bayesian model for the rapid and probabilistic evaluation of the relationships in the wfen in the water distribution system 3 results and discussion the results of this study are presented in three parts the results of modeling the operation of the agricultural water distribution system the results of evaluating the proposed methods based on the water food energy nexus indices and finally the results of modeling the bayesian networks 3 1 the results of modeling the operational methods in the agricultural water distribution system after modeling the different methods of operation in the rudasht water distribution system the values of the adequacy index at 26 grade 2 intakes located in the rudasht water distribution system were calculated under both the normal flow and the water shortage scenarios the results are summarized in table b in appendix 1 after calculating the values of the adequacy index at the grade 2 intakes it was necessary as was explained in the materials and methods section to calculate the extent of improvement in the adequacy index compared to the manual method for the different operating purposes to calculate the energy index for the modeling the water food energy nexus fig 5 shows the extent of improvement in the adequacy index compared to the manual method in case of upgrading the water distribution system using the various operational methods under both the normal flow and the water shortage scenarios according to fig 5 under the normal flow scenario the extent of improvement in the adequacy index was about 0 to 0 1 in the case of using the improved manual method in the water distribution system which does not amount to a substantial increase in the desirability of the practice of operational in the water distribution system the extents of improvement in the adequacy index for the pi and mpc methods were approximately between 0 2 and 0 5 considering the degree of growth and the manner of distribution of this improvement at the level of the water distribution system we can conclude that under the normal flow scenario the extent of development in the adequacy index was approximately the same in both the pi and the mpc methods however it should be noted that a significant volume of water was saved at the beginning part of the water distribution system in addition to improvement in the water distribution system in the mpc method by regulating water at the entrance of the water distribution system therefore it can be concluded that under the normal flow scenario agricultural water will be distributed more desirably among farmers in the mpc method compared to the other methods in the water shortage scenario upgrading the water distribution system to the improved manual method led to an improvement of zero to 0 1 in the adequacy index this extent of advance does not substantially improve the operational method in the water distribution system upgrading the operational method to the pi method in the upstream and midstream of the water distribution system improved the value of the adequacy index by about 0 7 to 0 8 however the calculated values of the adequacy index downstream of the water distribution system did not show any improvement fig 5 this means that the intakes downstream of the water distribution network receive no water through upgrading the water distribution system to the pi method it is important to note here that unequal water delivery can exacerbate social tensions and make utilization of this method impossible the mpc operational method was then analyzed to evaluate the performance of the rudasht agricultural water distribution system under the water shortage scenario according to fig 5 upgrading the water distribution system to the mpc method of operational raised the value of the adequacy index to about 0 3 although this is not a considerable improvement in the value of the adequacy index this increase is the same throughout the water distribution system fig 6 since water delivery and distribution in low flow conditions must be such that it is delivered to all water beneficiaries the mpc method is more suitable than the other techniques both under the low flow conditions and in normal flow conditions in the next step as shown in fig 6 the extents of improvement in the value of the adequacy index for the wells in the water distribution system were calculated at the level of the water distribution system fig 7 as explained in the materials and methods section the extents of improvement in the value of the adequacy index at each well were calculated to determine the amount of energy consumed for groundwater pumping figs 6 and 7 show the improvement of the adequacy of surface water distribution for using different operating systems i e improved manual operation pi and mpc under normal and water shortage scenarios for instance in the improved manual operation the adequacy of surface water distribution under the normal scenario is between 10 and 30 while in the shortage scenario this amount is less than 20 in all parts of the irrigation district by upgrading the operating system to the decentralized automatic one i e pi system the rate of improvement in agricultural water distribution in the normal scenario will be between 20 and 65 however application of the pi method in shortages scenario led to the district to two separate sections of i the upstream regions with more or less appropriate water distribution 30 to 70 and ii the downstream regions where none of the stakeholders receives any water according to the results employing the centralized control system by using mpc both in the normal scenario and shortage scenario fairly distribution of surface water is provided for the upstream and downstream regions based on the output of the operation modeling fig 6 the rate of reduction of groundwater abstraction is obtained by upgrading the mentioned methods and considering the spatial dispersion of the exploitation wells of fig 7 the energy consumed for groundwater pumping was calculated for the different operational methods such as 1 the manual 2 the improved manual 3 the pi and 4 the mpc methods based on which the value of the energy index obtained to evaluate the obtained nexus the results are presented below 3 2 values of the water food energy nexus indices since this study focuses on off farm focus the link between energy and food components concerning any improvement of surface water distribution within the district in other words the energy and food components come into play in the modeling by any changes in water allocation from surface and groundwater resources the improvement of surface water distribution led to a reliable water supply for the stakeholders i e farmers representatives for each region spatial analysis of the operational results fig 6 determines the regions with a reliable water supply and the distributed surface water is replaced by the groundwater extraction by changing the cultivation area supplied by the surface water resource the amount of food using food productivity fpro t index was determined separately for the surface and groundwater resources moreover the energy conservations due to decreasing groundwater abstraction are also computed for individual tube wells through the energy consumption ec t indicator accordingly different operating systems due to the inherent capability of the systems inefficient water distribution represent different feed backs in food and energy components of the surface and groundwater resources it is worth noting that as mentioned earlier any changes in on farm scale systems irrigation ones in the farms to agricultural systems were prevented for precise evaluation of the water distribution systems the ranges of changes in the values of the water food energy nexus under the normal flow and the water shortage scenarios for the four operations methods in the water distribution system 1 the existing operational method 2 the improved manual operational method 3 the decentralized automatic control method pi and 4 the model predictive control mpc method are presented in tables 4 and 5 according to table 4 under the normal flow scenario the ranges of changes in the values of the wfeni in case of using the manual operational method in the water distribution system operational were 46 49 56 70 36 51 and 47 53 respectively in the case of using the improved manual operational method in the water distribution system the values of the wefni were 35 52 61 71 41 53 and 51 55 respectively in the case of using the pi operational method in the water distribution system the values of the wfeni were 30 60 83 100 68 100 and 60 86 respectively finally by upgrading the water distribution by using the mpc method the values of the wfeni were 60 100 86 100 68 100 and 80 86 respectively therefore based on the values of the obtained index we can conclude that the mpc method performed better than the other methods in terms of the water food energy nexus in the water shortage scenario also as shown in table 5 the ranges of changes in the calculated values of the wfeni in the case of the manual operational method in the water distribution system were 0 49 0 21 0 11 and 0 27 respectively if the improved manual operational method was employed in the water distribution system the values of wfeni were 0 61 0 23 1 12 and 2 28 respectively in the case of employing the pi operational method in the water distribution system the values of the wfeni were 0 58 9 59 4 37 and 23 51 respectively finally by upgrading the operating system by using the mpc method in the water distribution system the values of the wfeni were 42 66 6 57 3 36 and 18 45 respectively the results obtained under the water shortage scenario showed that by improving the operational method in the distribution system to the pi method the values of the wfeni were more suitable than those of the mpc method however the value of the water index calculated to be between 66 42 using the mpc method showed more desirability than the pi method moreover the range of fluctuations in the value of the water index in the mpc method was narrower than that in the pi method this in itself suggested that water was delivered to all the intakes in the mpc method because of the above it is suggested that the water food energy nexus index be calculated downstream midstream and upstream of the water distribution systems because it can give managers and decision makers a more accurate idea of the status of the water distribution system in the low flow conditions by summing up the obtained results it can be declared that in the normal flow scenario the value of the water index increased by upgrading the water distribution system from manual to improved manual pi and mpc methods the most desirable status of the water index was associated with mpc method with the improvement of the operating system the values of the food and energy indices also improved like that of the water index did however no significant difference was found between the pi and mpc in these two indices as for the wfeni the values of 47 53 51 55 60 86 and 80 86 percent were obtained respectively after upgrading the water distribution system to the manual improved manual pi and mpc methods finally taking into account the results we can conclude that the mpc operational method performed better than the other ways in terms of the water food energy nexus under the normal flow scenario after upgrading the water distribution system to the manual improved manual pi and mpc methods the trend of changes in the nexus index under the water shortage scenario was different from that under the normal flow scenario the mpc method had a higher value for the water index than the other methods but the values for the food and energy indices and the wfeni were higher compared to the other operational methods when the water distribution system was upgraded to the pi method it is important to note here that in the pi method the downstream of the water distribution system did not benefit from upgrading the water distribution system and only the upstream of the water distribution system did therefore it is recommended to split the water distribution system into the three upstream midstream and downstream segments for more appropriate analysis of the water food energy nexus index and calculate the nexus indices for these three segments 3 3 results of bayesian network modeling in order to analyze and investigate the interactions uncertainties and cause effect relationships in the water food energy nexus a bayesian model was developed in this study to calculate the water food energy nexus index the proposed bayesian model structures for the water food energy nexus analysis introduced in the materials and methods section were calibrated and verified using hugin in order to select the best structure among the six selected bayesian models the two metrics of the mean absolute percentage error mape and the root mean square error rmse were used the calibration and verification results in terms of comparison between model outputs and reference values calculated by equations in table 2 for the six proposed structures are presented in table 6 the calibration results indicated that the sixth structure with ave mape 6 35 mape for wfeni 9 95 and rmse for wfeni 5 16 was better than the other five structures the verification results also showed that the sixth structure with ave mape 7 87 mape for wfeni 9 65 and rmse for wfeni 7 69 was more accurate than the other five structures therefore the sixth structure was chosen to analyze the water food energy nexus after selecting the best structure in the bayesian model the details of the accuracy of each node in the best structure were presented in table 7 in order to evaluate more accurately the performance of the model a 45 diagram was presented for all the nodes calculated by the model in the verification section fig 8 based on the model verification results and the 45 degree diagrams it can be concluded that the superior structure performed well and could be used to evaluate the water food energy nexus by taking into account the probabilities and cause effect relationships in the water distribution system 4 conclusion the comprehensive evaluation framework proposed in this study can be applied as a decision support model to prioritize the operating systems included in modernization innovation and improvement projects of irrigation districts this evaluation framework will help local managers to investigate environmental impacts including reducing over exploitation from the aquifer and consequently reducing energy consumption in the area and the technical consequences of upgrading the agricultural water distribution system this framework would be more effective in developed countries where the private sector manages the irrigation districts this is important from two main perspectives i considering the importance of maintaining agricultural activities in water shortage periods and achieving the intended economic goals because reduced losses in agricultural water distribution systems can compensate for a large part of water allocated to the irrigation district ii any improvement of irrigation systems within the farms must be consistent with the capabilities of the water distribution system within the district to maximize the level of physical and economic productivity of water at the farm it is worth noting that the framework developed in this study can be employed to upgrade the main water distribution system i e the main canal due to the limitations of the budget in the districts and the impossibility of significant investment in this sector in other words upgrading the main and lateral water distribution systems with modern methods automatic control is only feasible when its implementation is economically justifiable this will achieve when the price of surface water distributed is equal to the economic value of water so that modern agricultural systems precision agriculture are accessible for all in farm activities along with a fully automatic distribution system this limitation made it one of the most severe challenges for the researchers to determine the level of impact of the optimal distribution of agricultural water supplied from surface water resources accordingly the lateral distribution system a canal network that receives water from the main system and conveys it to the individual farms was modeled based on the current manual operation the method is based on an up down management approach and acts by manually adjusting the off takes according to a scheduled water delivery programming in other words the conventional operation of water distribution in the lateral network significantly affected the optimal performance of the automatic control system in the main system the development of an automatic control model for the lateral system and examining the performance of the full automatic system from reservoirs to farms are therefore main suggestions for future research so that the real impact of using automatic control systems on the exploitation of agricultural water distribution systems can be measured it is thus recommended to develop a comprehensive framework for evaluating agricultural water management including water distribution and application by developing the mathematical model of water application systems on the farm scale i e surface irrigation and pressurized irrigation methods and linking it to the distribution system the development of an evaluating framework based on the wfe nexus and including economic discussion as well as presenting a wfe nexus framework is another topic that needs to be covered given the dominance of a technical attitude in this research the application of agricultural economics models e g the positive mathematical planning model pmp with the developed evaluation framework makes it feasible to investigate the reactions of farmers about promoting agricultural water distribution systems such a reaction appears typically during the change in cultivation pattern i e under a constant level of cultivation and variable density of cultivation of different crops and exerts its impact on food and economy also the application of agricultural economics models makes it possible to measure the improvement of water distribution systems from the attitude of sustainable development considering

10563,a three year study was conducted to assess the ability of satellite based vegetation index vi images to track evapotranspiration over wheat while the ability of using vis notably with the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi to track vegetation growth has been well established the operational capability to accurately estimate the crop coefficient kc and crop evapotranspiration etc at farm scale from spaceborne platforms has not been widely studied the study evaluated wheat et over 7 sites between 2016 and 2019 in yuma and maricopa arizona usa estimated by using sentinel 2 and venus satellites to map ndvi time series for entire wheat cropping seasons december to june the basal crop coefficient kcb was modeled by the ndvi time series and the daily fao56 reference eto was obtained by near by weather network stations eddy covariance ec stations in each field observed etc during the same seasonal periods and applied irrigation amounts were logged the experiment found that remote sensing of ndvi and modeled kcb accurately estimated kc and crop et during mid season through senescence in most cases however ndvi based estimation performed less well during early season 60 days after planting when observed etc was highly variable due to frequent rain and irrigation at low crop cover mid season kc values observed for the seven wheat fields were from 0 92 to 1 14 and end of season kc values ranged from about 0 20 to 0 40 in close agreement to values reported elsewhere seasonal vi based transpiration and etc values ranged from 467 to 618 mm closely agreeing with seasonal ec data which ranged 499 684 mm using the venus sensor the study in maricopa in 2019 revealed that when augmented by a background soil water balance model water stressed wheat can be detected mid season with ndvi this capability is specifically due to the sensor s ability to provide well calibrated images every 2 days findings from this study will help farmers irrigators and water managers use and understand the capabilities of visible near infrared remote sensing to track etc from space 1 introduction since publication of the fao 56 crop water requirements computational procedures allen et al 1998 much research has focused on estimating crop evapotranspiration etc with real time single kc or basal crop coefficients kcb based on vegetation index vi data as applied with the fao56 penman monteith pm reference crop evapotranspiration equation eto for many annual field crops certain biophysical parameters such as crop cover fraction fc plant density and leaf area index lai have been closely monitored in time and space by remotely sensed vegetation indices wiegand et al 1991 pinter et al 2003 duchemin et al 2006 hunsaker et al 2007 for vegetation monitoring a widely used vi is the normalized difference ratio of the near infrared nir and red reflectance bands or normalized difference vegetation index ndvi glenn et al 2011 similarities between the time series patterns of vis and crop coefficients also occur as noted decades ago by jackson et al 1980 early studies by bausch and neale 1989 and bausch 1995 developed methods to improve etc estimation for corn with the use of real time vi based kcb they denoted as surrogate crop coefficients bausch 1995 incorporated observed vi based kcb for corn within an existing weather based irrigation scheduling model and reported reduced irrigation applications and better timing of irrigation over the model that used empirically derived time based crop coefficients one of the very first studies to directly implement remotely sensed vi data within the fao56 dual crop coefficient approach was conducted for cotton by hunsaker et al 2003 in arizona united states us they derived a calibration model to predict p m based kcb with ndvi measured 2 3 times weekly using a pole mounted radiometer over a clay loam soil however due to the influence of soil background on ndvi especially soil color or brightness when fc is low that kcb ndvi calibration model did not transfer well when used in cotton grown in the same climate but on a sandy loam soil hunsaker et al 2005a the soil adjusted vegetation index savi was developed by huete 1988 to minimize soil brightness effects on spectral indices in the nir and red wavelengths some research studies imply that savi may be a more preferable vi to model crop coefficients bausch 1995 jayanthi et al 2007 gonzalez dugo et al 2009 while the majority of vi kcb studies to date have used ndvi many have indirectly accounted for differences in soil background by scaling observed ndvi and kcb for crops between minimum values at dry bare soil ndvimin and kcb min usually taken as 0 15 and maximum values at effective full cover ndvimax and kcb max campos et al 2010 compared scaled ndvi and savi calibration models to predict measured kcb in irrigated grapes and found slightly better correlation using ndvi commonly a linear relationship between kcb and ndvi is assumed as by neale et al 1989 lopez urrea et al 2009 campos et al 2010 sánchez et al 2012 and rozenstein et al 2018 and the calibration takes the form kcb b ndvi a where a and b are the regression coefficients and ndvi is the scaled ndvi differently er raki et al 2007 2010 in morocco utilized a wheat kcb curve using scaled ndvi as an exponential function based on lai thus allowing kcb to increase with ndvi in a curvilinear manner gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 later developed a more generalized vi based exponential model for this concept a comprehensive listing of the many types of kc vi and kcb vi relationships developed for crops is provided by pôças et al 2020 in this special issue assessing three years of maricopa arizona wheat field studies hunsaker et al 2005b used observed ndvi data to develop a kcb model the ndvi values were normalized between zero for dry bare soil ndvimin and 1 0 for average maximum ndvi at full cover ndvimax 1 ndvin ndvi ndvimin ndvimax ndvimin where ndvin is the normalized ndvi and ndvi is the field observed value weekly measurements of wheat et in those studies were obtained using a soil water balance swb in which weekly soil water content was measured in well watered drip irrigated plots using neutron probe and time domain reflectometry average weekly values of the kcb were calculated by the fao56 dual approach based on the fao56 p m eto equation using meteorological parameters measured by the university of arizona weather station at maricopa the weekly kcb values were paired with average weekly ndvin measured with a pole mounted radiometer above the plots in that clay loam soil field the average observed ndvimin by the radiometer varied from 0 155 to 0 191 for the three years whereas the average maximum ndvi only varied from 0 922 to 0 927 the relationship between kcb and ndvin was found to be described by a cubic regression model with a coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 90 n 232 hunsaker et al 2005b the model was then applied in real time irrigation scheduling studies for two years with the same wheat variety at a nearby site in maricopa that had sandy loam texture at the soil surface and sandy clay loam texture at deeper layers hunsaker et al 2007 using the same radiometer methods as in the clay loam studies ndvimin values measured for dry bare soil were on the order of 0 10 0 11 for the sandy loam while ndvimax was assumed as 0 925 based on that observed in the clay loam for real time use in irrigation scheduling prior knowledge of ndvimax for a crop is needed in order to properly scale the time series ndvin to kcb however when different platforms and sensors are used for ndvi ndvimax values for a given crop will likely vary depending on the sensor configuration and atmospheric correction techniques used thus empirical observations of ndvimax for the given crop and sensor system are recommended before the vi method is used in irrigation scheduling during the first year in the study by hunsaker et al 2007 the assumed ndvimax was very close to that measured at full cover 0 92 0 93 for well watered and fertilized wheat and kcb wheat et predictions versus measured as derived from the swb were highly correlated r2 0 94 0 95 although measured ndvimax was lower in the second year 0 89 0 91 due to nitrogen stress during crop development the etc predicted by the kcb ndvin model remained highly correlated with the measured etc r 2 0 88 0 94 indicating that the predictions of kcb based on ndvin were appropriate for the non optimal crop conditions as well as for optimal conditions hunsaker et al 2007 with the abundance of kcb ndvin data collected in the sandy loam wheat studies the data were combined with the data from the clay loam field to upgrade the wheat cubic regression model fig 1 a comparison of the derived cubic model with a linear model for wheat shows that kcb varies with ndvin in three phases for low ndvin between 0 and 0 4 emergence to about 25 cover kcb increases linearly with ndvin as crop development continues i e as ndvin goes from 0 40 to 0 90 the rate increase of kcb is less than the linear model this occurs as fc increases from 25 to about 75 in the third phase between ndvin from 0 90 to 1 0 75 100 cover kcb increases more rapidly than ndvin these different trends in kcb versus ndvin for wheat could also be modeled by three segmented linear regression lines however the third order regression model captures the variations well and is easier to compute the regression coefficients and related statistics for the cubic model of fig 1 are given in table 1 the subject for this vi study durum wheat triticum turgidum ssp durum desf also called pasta wheat is one of the most important crops grown worldwide kabbaj et al 2017 it is also one of the primary crops produced in irrigated desert regions of the southwestern us including arizona and california desert durum is grown as a winter crop in the state of arizona which has become the third largest producer of durum wheat in the us mon et al 2016 yuma county situated in the low desert of southwestern arizona is one of the world s foremost producers of lettuce and other winter vegetables however cultivation practices in the area are dominated by rotational cropping systems where a winter vegetable crop is followed by durum wheat melon or short season cotton taylor and koo 2015 desert durum in particular when grown in rotation plays an important secondary role in providing soil health benefits including maintaining soil salinity at optimal levels for the next vegetable crop a continuous goal in yuma and other irrigated desert areas in arizona is obtaining high crop productivity and reducing water use through improved management practices most of the gains in increased irrigation water use efficiencies in recent years for yuma have been attributed to on farm infrastructure improvements precision land leveling and minimizing crop production during the high evaporative demand months of summer taylor and koo 2015 improved irrigation scheduling methods could also play an important role in boosting water use efficiencies while most growers are aware of crop coefficient methods for irrigation scheduling they are not widely used in addition the available wheat crop coefficients for yuma and other arizona counties which were developed years ago need to be re evaluated and updated nevertheless most growers of durum wheat in these areas are highly experienced irrigators though usually relying primarily on soil shovel turning to estimate soil water depletion taylor and koo 2015 to date operational applications of kcb vi approaches for crop et monitoring and irrigation management in the us southwest have not been extended much beyond research studies thus the derived kcb ndvin model for wheat described in table 1 has not yet been evaluated at the farm scale but the rising number of public earth observation systems particularly the sentinel 2 mission and the new microsatellite venus theia cnes fr makes an evaluation in irrigated fields feasible sentinel 2 data can provide an ndvi time series at high temporal every five days and spatial resolution 10 m transon et al 2018 rozenstein et al 2018 venus has similar spectral characteristics to sentinel 2 but with 5 m nadir resolution and 2 day constant view angle acquisitions therefore to provide a starting point towards improved irrigation scheduling for durum wheat in the us southwest studies were conducted to evaluate the kcb ndvin model in seven commercial durum wheat farms six in yuma county and one at maricopa in pinal county arizona study objectives were 1 to assess model estimated crop transpiration tc and crop et using sentinel 2 and venus ndvi time series data in comparison with measured daily crop et obtained by eddy covariance ec towers installed at each field site 2 to derive single kc values for durum wheat based on measured etc and the fao56 p m eto and 3 to evaluate cumulative seasonal irrigation applied at each site with respect to the measured and estimated seasonal etc 2 methods 2 1 study sites the durum wheat sites were in southern arizona fig 2 a hot and arid lands receiving little rainfall typically ranging from 80 mm to 200 mm annually from western to central parts of the state this means that irrigation is required for all crop production most irrigation is applied by gravity in level basins and borders the study included 6 commercial sites in the yuma region fig 2b and one commercial site in the maricopa region fig 2c 81 000 and 23 800 irrigated hectares respectively all were level basin irrigated in recent years the yuma district has used approximately 108 000 ha m of colorado river water the maricopa stanfield irrigation district uses approximately 37 000 ha m of co mingled ground and colorado river water the six sites in yuma were on private farms denoted as s1 s2 s5 s6 s8 j118 fig 2d and e the seventh site in maricopa was also on a private farm h8 fig 2e general site descriptions are shown in table 2 providing planting harvest dates and length of run for the irrigation borders reference weather data were

measured from samples taken in the top 0 15 m soil depth at each site table 5 using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer all sites were part of crop rotations with double cropping of leafy greens and wheat common for yuma fields 2 2 evapotranspiration measurements the field schedule for evapotranspiration measurements consisted of eddy covariance stations as listed in table 6 the

had to be moved mid season to allow farm equipment access for spray applications in these instances the ec and net radiometers were temporarily relocated while the soil heat flux plates remained in place on re entry the sensors were replaced within a few cm of their original locations each station included an ec irga net radiometer at least two soil heat flux plates logger cell modem and solar

station functioning was monitored daily via cell phone modem links data were stored on compact flash cf cards that were changed approximately every 2 weeks subsequent processing of fluxes used r

self resolved gap filling techniques have been reported in reviewed in literature e g 15 of them by moffat et al 2007 the best approach would be to adopt one or more of those but time did not allow testing and implementation for all sensor and data collection maladies hence linear interpolation of relevant and co variant variables was employed where feasible meaning that fluxes were reconstructed from fundamental observables such as wind speed air temperature and humidity if available from ancillary instruments for example when the irga failed but not the sonic h fluxes were estimated by computing air density and heat capacity via independent slow response temperature humidity sensors for long duration time gaps more than 2 h linear interpolation to 30 minute time steps was not done and an alternative strategy had to be used in these cases gap filling was done daily since variability at shorter time steps was high energy balance closure was enforced using the bowen

resolution despite cloudy sky events data from two satellite sensors table 8 met these requirements sentinel 2 a b www esa int applications observing the earth copernicus sentinel 2 for 2017 and 2018 yuma data and venus https www theia land fr en product venus for the 2019 maricopa data incorporation of additional observations from landsat 7 and 8 would improve temporal sampling however they were not included due to the need for additional analyses to accommodate coarser 30 m spatial resolution and similar but not identical spectral sampling these differences complicate the generation of a unified ndvi time series sentinel 2 a b is a pair of identical satellites collectively observing identical targets weekly they are multispectral pushbroom instruments in sun synchronous orbits with overpass times in arizona at 11am data for ndvi have 10 m resolution orthorectified 100 km x 100 km tiles with top of atmosphere toa reflectance l1c were downloaded from usgs earthexplorer usgs gov because utm zone 12 is used for all arizona sites as part of usda maricopa lab gis protocol yuma area images needed to be re projected yuma lies slightly west of the nominal zone 12 boundary of 114 w for this task the gdal gdal org package gdalwarp as implemented in rgdal was used sentinel 2 ndvi values were generated from top of atmosphere toa bands 4 and 8 atmospherically corrected reflectance data are generally preferred and were used for the venus sensor data as noted below because the resulting indices are more representative of actual vegetation conditions than those derived from uncorrected data this preference however created a difficult to resolve data processing challenge tools such as 6s sen2agri and maja a package combining the multi sensor atmospheric correction and cloud screening maccs and atcor hagolle et al 2015 could have been used but necessary local atmospheric data and computer hardware were not available for consistency this unavailability suggested that all analyses be conducted using less than optimal toa data on the other hand if the effects of atmospheric corrections upon et estimates could be quantified then a compromise could be made toa data could be included while not losing results where surface reflectance data were available to show the viability of this latter approach we evaluated the effects of atmospheric corrections on four key parameters ndvi ndvin eq 1 kcb and etc using venus theia cnes fr data the venus project enabled the evaluation since it provides both 5 m top of atmosphere reflectance l1c and maja generated 10 m surface reflectance l2a data two regions from 2019 were considered the maricopa wheat field h8 and yuma wheat fields s1 s2 s5 s6 and s8 note that wheat grown at yuma in 2019 was not part of the ground study which meant that etc estimates from the atmospheric comparison study were compared but not validated the full wheat season late december 2018 to early june 2019 were assessed with 49 scenes over maricopa and 79 over yuma we show below that use of top of atmosphere data filtered to include only scenes with no visible clouds introduces small 5 bias errors for wheat grown in 2019 at maricopa venus microsatellite data were used data not available over yuma for the 2018 sites venus table 8 has similar spectral responses to sentinel 2 but is superior in several ways higher spatial resolution 5 10 m nadir resolution vs 20 60 m 2 day constant view angle acquisitions vs 5 10 day overpass frequency and availability of both top of atmosphere and atmospherically corrected reflectances consequently the potential temporal sampling intervals were greatly improved over alternative sensors orthorectified 27 km x 27 km multispectral l2a 10 m surface reflectance were used having noted a preference for atmospherically corrected reflectance images it also needs to be noted their use introduces a different side effect high sensitivity to noise in the red band since healthy vegetation has very low reflectivity in the red band noise in this spectral region can leadto anomalously high ndvi values one compensation approach for this outcome is to apply a constant offset to the red reflectance hagolle et al 2015 labo obs mip fr multitemp using ndvi with atmospherically corrected data to create a revised ndvi denoted acorvi 5 acorvi nir red 0 05 nir red 0 05 the suggested offset

4 estimation of transpiration and evapotranspiration using vegetation indices we use the empirical vegetation index for the southwestern us visw french et al 2018 to transform remotely sensed reflectance maps into daily evapotranspiration visw uses ndvi as a proxy for the basal crop coefficient kcb thus instead of using standardized estimates of vegetation cover one uses observations from satellite or airborne images and an empirical transformation developed by hunsaker et al 2005b and 2007 fig 1 table 1 i e 6 kcb min 0 15 0 176 1 325 ndvin 1 466 ndvin 2 1 146 ndvin 3 where ndvin is normalized ndvi as calculated in eq 1 for the present study the ndvimin and ndvimax values used to estimate the kcb for field sites are the lower and upper ndvi limits rigorous criteria for optimal limit selection do not exist hence objective thresholds based on observations were used we selected probability levels of 10 and 90 from the empirical ndvi distributions as defined in fao56 when potential effects of water stress on etc are considered actual etc etc act is computed as 7 etc act ks kcb ke eto where kcb represents crop transpiration tc ke is a coefficient for soil evaporation ks is the water stress coefficient and eto is grass reference evapotranspiration for the yuma sites we limit evaluation of the model equation 5 above to only estimate kcb with satellite ndvi and thus calculate only the tc portion of etc that is kcb times eto ks was not computed but assumed as 1 0 since we did not model the soil water balance swb thus water stress if any was not accounted for in the yuma tc estimates however for the maricopa field h8 having more frequent ndvi acquisitions simulated daily swb estimates i e a separate root zone and surface soil layer swb were made these enabled estimation of actual etc by evaluating ke and ks using the fao56 dual crop coefficient procedures parameters for calculating ke were based on the soil evaporation characteristics given in fao56 for the sandy clay loam soil at h8 fraction of soil wetted by irrigation and precipitation was set to 1 0 crop height and crop rooting depth were increased proportionately with estimated kcb until maximum values of 0 90 and 1 5 m respectively were reached maximum values referred to in fao56 for wheat similarly crop cover was increased to a maximum of 0 99 at maximum kcb but was allowed to decrease proportionately with kcb during late season senescence the soil water depletion fraction for no water stress p was set to 0 55 for etc act 5 0 mm day 1 and adjusted daily for atmospheric demand per fao56 table 22 and footnote 2 in computation ks taw dr 1 p taw where taw is total available water in the root zone mm and dr is the root zone depletion mm statistical comparisons between daily observed etc and either tc s sites or etc act h site were evaluated separately over different growth stages as well as for the entire wheat season growth stages were estimated based on evaluation of seasonal observed kc tends as described in the next section for each site statistics were analyzed over the initial and development mid season and late season stages analyses included linear correlation and root mean square error rmse mean difference md mean absolute difference mad and percent mad madp relative to the observed mean 2 5 measured and estimated crop coefficients daily values of the single crop coefficient kc were calculated for sites by dividing the observed daily etc from eddy covariance by daily eto segmented linear fao56 kc curves were derived by visually fitting the kc data to the initial mid season and late season growth stages the model estimated kcb for the yuma sites and the kcb and kc h8 site only were compared to the observed kc 2 6 evapotranspiration terminology to summarize this study compared evapotranspiration estimates from eddy covariance stations denoted observed etc against vegetation index based estimates derived from satellites in two different ways for all yuma sites model estimates represent just the transpiration component of etc and are denoted as tc for the maricopa site h8 modeling incorporated a soil water balance and results there are indicated as etc act 3 results 3 1 daily eddy covariance etc and eto eddy covariance data from all seven sites were quality checked unrealistic values were removed time data gaps filled energy balance enforced then outputs were compared with eto daily observed etc plots fig 3 display the timing of data gaps in terms of sample counts where non gap days over 48 30 minute samples are shown in blue continuously gapped days 0 samples are in black three of the sites s2 s6 and h8 had few gaps and could mostly be filled by linear interpolation the other four sites s8 j118 s1 and s5 had longer duration gaps and required multiple correction procedures gaps at s8 and s5 were almost exclusively due to loss of irga but not sonic values for these missing le data were estimated by energy balance residuals gap filling at s1 was done by a fortuitous arrangement with s2 an adjacent site with the same planting date and similar irrigation history in this case linear regressions between the s1 and s2 flux components during non gapped times were used to create predictions to fill s1 gaps the j118 site was the most problematic case three different procedures were needed to fill gaps linear interpolation was done for gaps less than 2 h le fluxes were computed by residuals for early and mid season times while for late times gap filling was done only at daily time intervals and used estimated crop coefficients this last step was done by using azmet yuma north gila eto values computing kc at the bounds of the data gap and then linearly interpolating the product kc x eto closure was computed for all stations at daily time steps a procedure that reduces energy storage effects then fit with linear models reported in table 9 are the summary statistics for each site on the left half and cumulative monthly feb may observed etc mm before and after correction via eq 2 average monthly observed etc error considering all months dec jun was 37 mm which means that closure corrected cumulative observed etc values were 30 greater than un corrected observations eddy covariance data over wheat for all three years showed consistent patterns of early season observed etc at 1 mm day ramping up to over 8 mm day mid season then rapidly dropping to 1 mm day on senescence comparisons between observed etc which includes both vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation and weather station derived eto are shown for all 7 sites in fig 4 for 2017 fig 5 for 2018 and fig 6 for 2019 where solid symbols indicate observed etc from eddy covariance observations and open symbols represent eto calculated from yuma north gila and maricopa azmet stations observed etc usually falls below eto until doy 60 then closely tracks it for the remainder of the season until senescence spikes in observed etc of 2 0 or more mm day above the trend generally coincide with preceding irrigation or precipitation events also shown in figs 4 6 most notable for high observed etc to eto ratios during early season were the s8 site in yuma 2016 17 fig 4a and the h8 site in maricopa 2018 19 fig 6 both sites in their respective wheat years experienced an irrigation immediately after planting and significantly more precipitation events early in the wheat season as compared to other sites and years cumulative observed etc ranged from 499 mm to 684 mm table 10 3 2 satellite based ndvi time series ndvi over wheat showed patterns similar to observed etc with a nearly flat trend before emergence a rapid increase close to maximum values at doy 50 60 a 30 day plateau region then an abrupt 10 20 day ndvi decline on senescence however there were significant differences between fields when examining details in 2017 s8 s earlier and more vigorous plant growth showed ndvi values rising above 0 8 and remaining above the later planted j118 site until april fig 7 dashed lines indicate threshold ndvi values for each site the different planting dates of fields at s1 6 are readily apparent for the 2018 sites fig 8 for these fields irrigation cut off led to nearly simultaneous senescence and nearly simultaneous ndvi drops the range for non atmospherically corrected values are compressed values ranging 0 1 0 82 for the 2019 h8 site fig 9 all 8 borders closely tracked each other with ndvi ranging from 0 0 to 0 9 a result of using atmospherically corrected observations highlighted by the dashed lines is an interval of crop water stress that is represented by an ndvi drop of about 5 the persistence of clear skies in combination with soil water balance modeling discussed below supports this interpretation 3 3 daily observed etc vs estimated tc and etc act applying the ndvi to kcb transformations resulted in time series modeled tc yuma sites and etc maricopa site values that closely track observed etc for 2017 fig 10 a and 10b for 2018 fig 11 a to 11d for yuma sites and 2019 fig 12 for h8 in maricopa trends previously observed are mimicked by ndvi implemented modeling where many of the irrigation events are represented by spikes in both etc and satellite based ndvi the h8 site for 2019 shows the average modeled etc act of the 8 borders along with observed etc at h8 fig 12 results from estimated tc and etc for the 2018 and 2019 seasons showed seasonal patterns where vi derived estimates closely agreed with observed etc at mid season but consistently underestimated etc at early and late growth seasons estimated tc non adjusted for water stress for early season conditions at yuma sites in 2017 fig 10 and 2018 fig 11 are consistent with expectations for sparse cover tc is low while etc is relatively high due to soil evaporation observed etc for all four s sites in 2018 increased above estimated tc following irrigations applied on day of year doy 40 for s1 and s2 fig 11a and b doy 30 for s5 fig 11c and doy 53 for s6 fig 11d starting in early march 2018 consistency among all four sites is restored about doy 65 at near full cover and when tc and etc should be nearly the same estimated tc agrees well with measured etc during the later season doy after 110 tc underestimates measured etc suggesting higher soil evaporation at late season irrigation when crop cover is reduced for 2017 seasonal total estimated tc is within 20 mm of total observed etc at s8 but was 73 mm less for j118 table 10 seasonal total estimated tc for yuma site s2 is close within 16 mm to total observed etc however for sites s1 s5 and s6 total tc is 52 110 mm less than total observed etc suggesting more soil evaporation may have occurred at those sites particularly during the early season at the maricopa field fig 12 where etc act was estimated agreement was very good except for underestimated etc for doy between 20 and 35 total estimated etc act was only 17 mm less than observed total at h8 as alluded to earlier concerning water stress at h8 according to the swb model the estimated etc act was reduced by water stress ks 1 0 for ten days at the end of a 21 day lapse without irrigation or significant rain i e from doy 98 107 this period is mid season when wheat etc is high the estimated water stress during this period reduced the estimated etc by about 17 mm from a non stress condition while observed etc also declined during this 10 day period reduction was greater for etc act fig 12 the statistical correlations and mean differences between daily estimated tc or etc and the observed etc for different growth stages and for all stages combined are shown for the 2017 yuma sites table 11 and for the 2018 sites in yuma and the 2019 site in maricopa table 12 the 2017 results indicate that estimated daily tc was less than observed etc during initial development stages with a madp of 37 39 as expected based on the daily estimated and observed values shown in fig 10 agreement at s8 and j118 was much better during the mid season stage madp within 14 although mean tc was higher than observed mean etc for s8 the trend remained for s8 during the late season suggesting observed etc may have experienced water stress that was unaccounted for by the tc estimates based on rather large gaps in ndvi data for 2018 observed data were well correlated high r value and rmse 0 45 mm d for s1 s2 and s5 during the initial development period and less correlated for s6 and h8 the higher correlations indicate that the daily trends for estimated tc were similar to those for observed etc during the early growth stages though mean daily tc was much lower than mean observed etc as indicated by the madp 36 40 for s1 s2 and s5 although the estimated tc for s6 and etc act for h8 were not as well correlated with daily observed during the early growth stages the madp was about the same for s6 and even lower for h8 28 compared with the three other s sites smaller r values and higher rmse during mid season than early season for the four s sites indicate that daily values of estimated tc were generally less aligned with daily observed fluctuations daily etc act and observed etc were better correlated during mid season than during earlier stages for all sites the absolute differences between estimated and observed were smallest during the mid season varying in madp from 13 to 18 tables 11 and 12 late season r values were relatively high at all sites indicating an agreement in trend between estimated and observed the daily values absolute agreement based on madp 19 22 was best for s5 and for the h8 site when etc act was estimated considering the daily data for the entire season estimated data were well correlated and similar for all sites and years where r values were 0 85 91 and rmse were near 1 0 mm d mean absolute differences for the entire season were from 0 78 to 1 07 mm d indicating estimated values were about 20 23 less than observed for the season the total irrigation applied to wheat borders at the six yuma sites table 10 were generally not much higher than the total observed etc albeit with one exception at j118 otherwise total irrigation varied from 34 mm less to 191 mm more than total etc indicating high irrigation efficiencies in contrast to these irrigation at the maricopa h8 site was less efficient with total irrigation exceeding total etc by over 1000 mm the grower at h8 realized something had changed in his organic wheat borders that made the water advance times much slower than in the previous year the lowest grain yield for all sites was at j118 in 2017 table 10 which was a smaller field with a much sandier soil profile below 0 15 m than the other sites because of the high infiltration rate in j118 the field had to be irrigated at high flow rates which ultimately led to exceedingly high irrigation depths relative to etc the relatively low yield for h8 organic wheat could reflect deep leaching of nutrients due to excessive irrigation 3 4 daily observed kc and modeled kcb and kc high observed kc during early season for s8 in 2016 2017 fig 13 a reflects soil evaporation due to the post plant irrigation and the frequent occurrence of precipitation during dec jan in contrast j118 planted in mid jan 2017 without a post plant irrigation had lower observed kc during the early stages of growth fig 13b at mid season average kc at s8 was 1 06 but observed kc likely declined during mid season between doy 77 84 due to water stress in contrast average kc during mid season for j118 was only 0 92 and daily values were similar to modeled kcb until doy 100 when kcb rapidly declined relative to observed kc end of season observed kc was similar for s8 and j118 about 0 30 the measured kc for the s1 s2 s5 and s6 yuma sites in 2018 showed similar trends with time fig 14 however the measured kc data during the early season for these sites were variable with generally lower observed kc at the s1 site fig 14a and s2 site fig 14b than at s5 fig 14c and s6 fig 14d for all the s sites in 2018 except s6 which was planted later kc spikes high following a rain on doy 9 and 10 albeit the two day kc spike in s5 appeared unrealistically high for s6 the observed kc spiked from doy 55 60 following irrigation application although these spikes corresponded to a time of low crop cover indicated by the low ndvi at the time for s6 in fig 8 they were higher than expected thus fitting an fao56 initial horizontal kc was difficult due to the variable early season kc data measured kc reached maximum values at mid season from about doy 40 70 depending on planting date for s sites and then kc plateaued fluctuating about the fitted horizontal mid season fao56 curve fig 14 obvious declines in kc data occurred after mid season starting around doy 130 140 for s1 s2 and s6 and around doy 120 for s5 which was planted earlier than the other s sites the kc data at the estimated mid season growth averaged 1 14 for s1 1 05 for s2 and s6 and 1 10 for s5 those values are the same as the estimated fao56 mid season segment shown in each figure end of season kc varied from about 0 20 to 0 30 for the s sites indicating the dry soil condition prior to harvest estimated kcb values derived from satellite ndvi show some overestimation from doy 40 90 and underestimation after doy 110 relative to the kc for s1 fig 14a the estimated kcb for s2 fig 14b appears to be closely representative of actual kc data during development where kcb is about 0 10 lower than kc though kcb then becomes higher than kc for a period during mid season the estimated kcb values are much lower than kc during initial through development stages for s5 and s6 likely indicating that soil evaporation was higher at those sites than s1 and s2 during mid season and late estimated kcb is consistent with measured kc for s5 for s6 mid season kcb fits the measured data well with some underestimation during late season comparison of the seasonal totals of measured etc show good agreement with the estimated total tc table 10 for the s sites in 2018 showing total tc was less than etc by 16 110 mm depending on site for the maricopa site fig 15 an initial fao56 kc line was not given due to very high early season measured kc caused by significant rain during january 2019 the kc during development period doy 10 50 for h8 was also skewed when frequent rain occurred the estimated fao56 mid season kc for h8 in 2019 was 1 1 higher than those in yuma in 2018 the end of season kc was about 0 40 the swb and vi based modeled daily kc was not consistent with observed kc during the rainy development period however it was close to the observed data during mid season the modeled kc captured the decline in kc due to water stress between doy 98 and 107 and the increased jump in observed kc following the irrigation on doy 108 as mentioned earlier total observed etc was 17 mm more than total modeled etc table 10 indicating good seasonal agreement estimated seasonal evaporation for h8 was about 65 mm similar to the difference in total etc and tc at the s5 and s6 sites 3 5 assessment of satellite based ndvi lastly a parallel study assessed the importance of atmospheric correction to satellite reflectance data and specifically to resulting et estimates as expected ndvi values were found strongly affected but subsequent effects were greatly reduced after ndvi normalization results from analysis over the h8 site at maricopa are shown in fig 16 a and for the s wheat sites at yuma in fig 16b red symbols represent parameters derived from non corrected l1c venus data while blue symbols are corresponding parameters for corrected l2a data the adjusted ndvi denoted acorvi on top panels are sensitive to atmospheric corrections where the range of indices are reduced by 25 40 when the acorvi values are normalized using eq 1 and vi limits at 10 and 90 quantiles ndvin estimates from l1c mostly agree within 5 of l2a data for both sites normalization at yuma led to thresholding at full canopy a contributing factor to the small differences observed at mid season transformations to kcb are shown in the third panels of fig 16a and 16b at the maricopa h 8 site normalization thresholds for l1c data over estimate surface reflectance in the early and mid seasons while the over estimations occur in the late season for yuma sites a difference possibly due to differing soil reflectivity daily etc values bottom most panels are obtained by linearly interpolating satellite derived kcb values to daily time steps then multiplying these by eto obtained from azmet data daily etc estimates differ by less than 1 mm day and cumulative full season et indicated on left side of each panel by 30 mm this two site test indicated that use of top of atmosphere satellite data after normalization is likely to result in etc estimation errors on the order of 5 or less 4 discussion results from the arizona wheat studies demonstrated the practicality and accuracy of the spaceborne ndvi based kcb model to estimate daily and seasonal crop water use of wheat usable satellite scenes ranged between 25 and 65 per growing season which corresponds to a realized periodicity of 3 7 days this high cadence possible because of sentinel 2 and venus capabilities and a favorable clear sky environment enabled excellent tracking of wheat canopy growth considering 7 sites visited over 2016 2019 using eddy covariance observations the study estimated total etc in the range of 499 684 mm values less than total irrigation on the order of 50 100 mm for s1 s6 sites and 201 mm for s8 suggesting reasonable irrigation efficiencies at those sites notable exceptions in irrigation efficiency occurred at h8 where applied irrigations exceeded observed etc by over 1000 mm and j118 where irrigations exceeded etc by nearly 1500 mm these differences highlight that ec monitoring generally cannot capture highly inefficient scheduling absent slow infiltration conditions comparing total observed etc for seven sites in arizona to remotely sensed estimates showed agreement within 16 110 mm over the growing season and estimates were consistent with the seasonal etc value of 655 mm provided by erie et al 1982 for the southwestern us this indicates that satellite based vi offers a good way to estimate seasonal etc once relationships with ec data have been tested when assessing within season water use there were differences in performance of the vi based estimates in early vs mid late periods mid season observed kc values ranged from 1 05 to 1 14 for sites that were considered not highly water stressed and values are consistent with literature findings for wheat reported by pereira et al 2020 this special issue which ranged from 1 0 1 3 based on the fao56 grass reference eto observed end of season kc varied from about 0 2 to 0 4 considering the yuma and maricopa sites range in values reported for end of season wheat kc in the literature review by pereira et al 2020 are from 0 1 to 0 4 for low moisture grain agreement between tc and etc estimates obtained via sentinel 2 and venus observations respectively agreed well with ec observations after the first 50 60 days of growth on the other hand early season tc and etc estimates in 2016 2019 60 days were erratic and not as reliable an outcome to be expected in part because sparse vegetation cover contributes a noisy and weak signal to the ndvi time series note that had an alternate linear formulation for kcb been used drerup et al 2017 er raki et al 2007 early season tc and etc estimates would also be less than observed additional reasons for worse early season performance were the occurrences of soil surface evaporation from rainfall events and some ec sensor failures soil evaporation could be better accommodated with thermal remote sensing with sensors such as landsat and ecostress errors induced by equipment failure emphasize the difficulty of data gap filling lacking sufficient thermal data utilization of fao56 methods allen et al 1998 to estimate kc remains preferred for the early season irrigation scheduling this may also include the need to construct an appropriate localized segmented fao56 kc curve to estimate etc until satellite ndvi are deemed reliable e g 60 days after planting when irrigation scheduling starts in earnest in arizona a notable finding from the study was a demonstration of the ability to use ndvi to detect water stress commonly one assumes that the ndvi signal is too imprecise to be used for abnormal plant water conditions and for such cases thermal infrared sensing should be used in a ground based study over wheat jackson et al 1982 reported no immediate resolution of water stress with any of the tested indices data from this study indicate that is not necessarily true results from the 2017 yuma sites s8 and j118 and the 2019 maricopa h8 sites showed that for irrigated seasonal crops such as wheat a combination of frequent well calibrated high spatial resolution visible near infrared remote sensing can resolve water stress for the maricopa event a clear and persistent 5 drop in ndvi occurred within 2 days of soil water balance model predicted stress one can foresee an operational system with short latency that could detect and forecast water stress events based on a collection of frequent ndvi data supported by a background soil water balance model although the study did not investigate swb status at the 2017 yuma s8 and j118 sites stress may be indicated there too by ndvi in these instances the indicators could be anomalous depressions at short and long duration time scales thus for non standard conditions quantile selection for ndvi normalization won t be sufficient for crop coefficient estimation instead historical or spatially contextual selection of ndvi limits would be needed required conditions to make detection feasible and reliable include accurate atmospheric corrections to the time series accurate satellite calibration similar satellite view angles for all overpasses high spatial 10 m or better resolution and frequent overpasses 7 days this latter aspect which venus eminently provided with 2 day sampling demonstrates the value of high cadence imaging with frequent images trend persistence adds confidence that the observations are real and not acquisitional or processing artifacts less frequent images separated by a week or more would make it more likely that stress signals would remain unrecognized because of small sample sizes and the increased probability of confounding rainfall or irrigation events the availability of frequent images also suggests a change in analysis time series should not be smoothed with filters such as savitzky golay savitzky and golay 1964 because that step would reduce or remove the stress signals 5 conclusions a three year study was undertaken to evaluate and validate tc and etc over irrigated durum wheat using a previously developed basal crop coefficient model based on vegetation indices that were derived in this study from spaceborne platforms comparisons based on eddy covariance etc observations indicated the remotely sensed modeled values agreed very well for the total season and for most of the growing season with best agreement during mid season measured single crop coefficients at mid season and end of season for durum wheat were consistent to those presented in the original fao56 table and to those updated in the present special issue agreement was not as good for early season wheat growth an outcome consistent with the limited ability of vis to detect soil evaporation and to accurately represent transpiration over sparse cover the latter results suggest that additional methods such as fao56 procedures to handle initial kc values or additional measurements will be needed to supplement vi based etc capabilities prior to effective wheat cover however mid season etc can be accurately modeled with vi based approaches even during water stress events the results strengthen existing reports on fao56 mid season crop coefficients to use for wheat additional studies in environments different from the u s southwest are needed to show that the vi methodology is broadly applicable for wheat grown elsewhere in addition the satellite based approach described in this study is under evaluation for lettuce spinach melon and cotton the aim is to demonstrate its potential

10563,a three year study was conducted to assess the ability of satellite based vegetation index vi images to track evapotranspiration over wheat while the ability of using vis notably with the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi to track vegetation growth has been well established the operational capability to accurately estimate the crop coefficient kc and crop evapotranspiration etc at farm scale from spaceborne platforms has not been widely studied the study evaluated wheat et over 7 sites between 2016 and 2019 in yuma and maricopa arizona usa estimated by using sentinel 2 and venus satellites to map ndvi time series for entire wheat cropping seasons december to june the basal crop coefficient kcb was modeled by the ndvi time series and the daily fao56 reference eto was obtained by near by weather network stations eddy covariance ec stations in each field observed etc during the same seasonal periods and applied irrigation amounts were logged the experiment found that remote sensing of ndvi and modeled kcb accurately estimated kc and crop et during mid season through senescence in most cases however ndvi based estimation performed less well during early season 60 days after planting when observed etc was highly variable due to frequent rain and irrigation at low crop cover mid season kc values observed for the seven wheat fields were from 0 92 to 1 14 and end of season kc values ranged from about 0 20 to 0 40 in close agreement to values reported elsewhere seasonal vi based transpiration and etc values ranged from 467 to 618 mm closely agreeing with seasonal ec data which ranged 499 684 mm using the venus sensor the study in maricopa in 2019 revealed that when augmented by a background soil water balance model water stressed wheat can be detected mid season with ndvi this capability is specifically due to the sensor s ability to provide well calibrated images every 2 days findings from this study will help farmers irrigators and water managers use and understand the capabilities of visible near infrared remote sensing to track etc from space 1 introduction since publication of the fao 56 crop water requirements computational procedures allen et al 1998 much research has focused on estimating crop evapotranspiration etc with real time single kc or basal crop coefficients kcb based on vegetation index vi data as applied with the fao56 penman monteith pm reference crop evapotranspiration equation eto for many annual field crops certain biophysical parameters such as crop cover fraction fc plant density and leaf area index lai have been closely monitored in time and space by remotely sensed vegetation indices wiegand et al 1991 pinter et al 2003 duchemin et al 2006 hunsaker et al 2007 for vegetation monitoring a widely used vi is the normalized difference ratio of the near infrared nir and red reflectance bands or normalized difference vegetation index ndvi glenn et al 2011 similarities between the time series patterns of vis and crop coefficients also occur as noted decades ago by jackson et al 1980 early studies by bausch and neale 1989 and bausch 1995 developed methods to improve etc estimation for corn with the use of real time vi based kcb they denoted as surrogate crop coefficients bausch 1995 incorporated observed vi based kcb for corn within an existing weather based irrigation scheduling model and reported reduced irrigation applications and better timing of irrigation over the model that used empirically derived time based crop coefficients one of the very first studies to directly implement remotely sensed vi data within the fao56 dual crop coefficient approach was conducted for cotton by hunsaker et al 2003 in arizona united states us they derived a calibration model to predict p m based kcb with ndvi measured 2 3 times weekly using a pole mounted radiometer over a clay loam soil however due to the influence of soil background on ndvi especially soil color or brightness when fc is low that kcb ndvi calibration model did not transfer well when used in cotton grown in the same climate but on a sandy loam soil hunsaker et al 2005a the soil adjusted vegetation index savi was developed by huete 1988 to minimize soil brightness effects on spectral indices in the nir and red wavelengths some research studies imply that savi may be a more preferable vi to model crop coefficients bausch 1995 jayanthi et al 2007 gonzalez dugo et al 2009 while the majority of vi kcb studies to date have used ndvi many have indirectly accounted for differences in soil background by scaling observed ndvi and kcb for crops between minimum values at dry bare soil ndvimin and kcb min usually taken as 0 15 and maximum values at effective full cover ndvimax and kcb max campos et al 2010 compared scaled ndvi and savi calibration models to predict measured kcb in irrigated grapes and found slightly better correlation using ndvi commonly a linear relationship between kcb and ndvi is assumed as by neale et al 1989 lopez urrea et al 2009 campos et al 2010 sánchez et al 2012 and rozenstein et al 2018 and the calibration takes the form kcb b ndvi a where a and b are the regression coefficients and ndvi is the scaled ndvi differently er raki et al 2007 2010 in morocco utilized a wheat kcb curve using scaled ndvi as an exponential function based on lai thus allowing kcb to increase with ndvi in a curvilinear manner gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 later developed a more generalized vi based exponential model for this concept a comprehensive listing of the many types of kc vi and kcb vi relationships developed for crops is provided by pôças et al 2020 in this special issue assessing three years of maricopa arizona wheat field studies hunsaker et al 2005b used observed ndvi data to develop a kcb model the ndvi values were normalized between zero for dry bare soil ndvimin and 1 0 for average maximum ndvi at full cover ndvimax 1 ndvin ndvi ndvimin ndvimax ndvimin where ndvin is the normalized ndvi and ndvi is the field observed value weekly measurements of wheat et in those studies were obtained using a soil water balance swb in which weekly soil water content was measured in well watered drip irrigated plots using neutron probe and time domain reflectometry average weekly values of the kcb were calculated by the fao56 dual approach based on the fao56 p m eto equation using meteorological parameters measured by the university of arizona weather station at maricopa the weekly kcb values were paired with average weekly ndvin measured with a pole mounted radiometer above the plots in that clay loam soil field the average observed ndvimin by the radiometer varied from 0 155 to 0 191 for the three years whereas the average maximum ndvi only varied from 0 922 to 0 927 the relationship between kcb and ndvin was found to be described by a cubic regression model with a coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 90 n 232 hunsaker et al 2005b the model was then applied in real time irrigation scheduling studies for two years with the same wheat variety at a nearby site in maricopa that had sandy loam texture at the soil surface and sandy clay loam texture at deeper layers hunsaker et al 2007 using the same radiometer methods as in the clay loam studies ndvimin values measured for dry bare soil were on the order of 0 10 0 11 for the sandy loam while ndvimax was assumed as 0 925 based on that observed in the clay loam for real time use in irrigation scheduling prior knowledge of ndvimax for a crop is needed in order to properly scale the time series ndvin to kcb however when different platforms and sensors are used for ndvi ndvimax values for a given crop will likely vary depending on the sensor configuration and atmospheric correction techniques used thus empirical observations of ndvimax for the given crop and sensor system are recommended before the vi method is used in irrigation scheduling during the first year in the study by hunsaker et al 2007 the assumed ndvimax was very close to that measured at full cover 0 92 0 93 for well watered and fertilized wheat and kcb wheat et predictions versus measured as derived from the swb were highly correlated r2 0 94 0 95 although measured ndvimax was lower in the second year 0 89 0 91 due to nitrogen stress during crop development the etc predicted by the kcb ndvin model remained highly correlated with the measured etc r 2 0 88 0 94 indicating that the predictions of kcb based on ndvin were appropriate for the non optimal crop conditions as well as for optimal conditions hunsaker et al 2007 with the abundance of kcb ndvin data collected in the sandy loam wheat studies the data were combined with the data from the clay loam field to upgrade the wheat cubic regression model fig 1 a comparison of the derived cubic model with a linear model for wheat shows that kcb varies with ndvin in three phases for low ndvin between 0 and 0 4 emergence to about 25 cover kcb increases linearly with ndvin as crop development continues i e as ndvin goes from 0 40 to 0 90 the rate increase of kcb is less than the linear model this occurs as fc increases from 25 to about 75 in the third phase between ndvin from 0 90 to 1 0 75 100 cover kcb increases more rapidly than ndvin these different trends in kcb versus ndvin for wheat could also be modeled by three segmented linear regression lines however the third order regression model captures the variations well and is easier to compute the regression coefficients and related statistics for the cubic model of fig 1 are given in table 1 the subject for this vi study durum wheat triticum turgidum ssp durum desf also called pasta wheat is one of the most important crops grown worldwide kabbaj et al 2017 it is also one of the primary crops produced in irrigated desert regions of the southwestern us including arizona and california desert durum is grown as a winter crop in the state of arizona which has become the third largest producer of durum wheat in the us mon et al 2016 yuma county situated in the low desert of southwestern arizona is one of the world s foremost producers of lettuce and other winter vegetables however cultivation practices in the area are dominated by rotational cropping systems where a winter vegetable crop is followed by durum wheat melon or short season cotton taylor and koo 2015 desert durum in particular when grown in rotation plays an important secondary role in providing soil health benefits including maintaining soil salinity at optimal levels for the next vegetable crop a continuous goal in yuma and other irrigated desert areas in arizona is obtaining high crop productivity and reducing water use through improved management practices most of the gains in increased irrigation water use efficiencies in recent years for yuma have been attributed to on farm infrastructure improvements precision land leveling and minimizing crop production during the high evaporative demand months of summer taylor and koo 2015 improved irrigation scheduling methods could also play an important role in boosting water use efficiencies while most growers are aware of crop coefficient methods for irrigation scheduling they are not widely used in addition the available wheat crop coefficients for yuma and other arizona counties which were developed years ago need to be re evaluated and updated nevertheless most growers of durum wheat in these areas are highly experienced irrigators though usually relying primarily on soil shovel turning to estimate soil water depletion taylor and koo 2015 to date operational applications of kcb vi approaches for crop et monitoring and irrigation management in the us southwest have not been extended much beyond research studies thus the derived kcb ndvin model for wheat described in table 1 has not yet been evaluated at the farm scale but the rising number of public earth observation systems particularly the sentinel 2 mission and the new microsatellite venus theia cnes fr makes an evaluation in irrigated fields feasible sentinel 2 data can provide an ndvi time series at high temporal every five days and spatial resolution 10 m transon et al 2018 rozenstein et al 2018 venus has similar spectral characteristics to sentinel 2 but with 5 m nadir resolution and 2 day constant view angle acquisitions therefore to provide a starting point towards improved irrigation scheduling for durum wheat in the us southwest studies were conducted to evaluate the kcb ndvin model in seven commercial durum wheat farms six in yuma county and one at maricopa in pinal county arizona study objectives were 1 to assess model estimated crop transpiration tc and crop et using sentinel 2 and venus ndvi time series data in comparison with measured daily crop et obtained by eddy covariance ec towers installed at each field site 2 to derive single kc values for durum wheat based on measured etc and the fao56 p m eto and 3 to evaluate cumulative seasonal irrigation applied at each site with respect to the measured and estimated seasonal etc 2 methods 2 1 study sites the durum wheat sites were in southern arizona fig 2 a hot and arid lands receiving little rainfall typically ranging from 80 mm to 200 mm annually from western to central parts of the state this means that irrigation is required for all crop production most irrigation is applied by gravity in level basins and borders the study included 6 commercial sites in the yuma region fig 2b and one commercial site in the maricopa region fig 2c 81 000 and 23 800 irrigated hectares respectively all were level basin irrigated in recent years the yuma district has used approximately 108 000 ha m of colorado river water the maricopa stanfield irrigation district uses approximately 37 000 ha m of co mingled ground and colorado river water the six sites in yuma were on private farms denoted as s1 s2 s5 s6 s8 j118 fig 2d and e the seventh site in maricopa was also on a private farm h8 fig 2e general site descriptions are shown in table 2 providing planting harvest dates and length of run for the irrigation borders reference weather data were taken from the azmet system cals arizona edu azmet which provides data over grass reference surfaces table 3 shows the average monthly data for weather parameters for the gila north yuma azmet station located approximately 8 12 km north of the yuma sites table 4 provides the average weather data for the maricopa agricultural center station about 8 km east of the h8 site soil texture fractions were measured from samples taken in the top 0 15 m soil depth at each site table 5 using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer all sites were part of crop rotations with double cropping of leafy greens and wheat common for yuma fields 2 2 evapotranspiration measurements the field schedule for evapotranspiration measurements consisted of eddy covariance stations as listed in table 6 the station components table 7 were predominantly manufactured by campbell scientific logan ut but also included li cor lincoln ne infrared gas analyzers kipp zonen net radiometers delft netherlands hukseflux soil heat flux plates delft netherlands and vaisala hmp45 temperature humidity probes vantaa finland five unique stations were used for the study 3 of which were new instruments 2017 station

zero and span of infrared gas analyzers irga were done in july 2017 and again in july 2018 stations were deployed immediately after planting then removed just prior to harvest occasionally stations had to be moved mid season to allow farm equipment access for spray applications in these instances the ec and net radiometers were temporarily relocated while the soil heat flux plates remained in place on re entry the sensors were replaced within a few cm of their original locations each station included an ec irga net radiometer at least two soil heat flux plates logger cell modem and solar power supply ecs were set horizontally all sites were flat and close to level and mounted approximately 1 m above the top of canopy net radiometers were deployed 1 m over the canopy and facing due south with two exceptions two soil heat flux plates were deployed adjacent i e offset 1 m east and west to the station s net radiometer and at 5 cm depths the exceptions were at s8 and j188 sites where four plates were deployed to estimate heat storage above the plates two pairs of thermocouples were installed above each plate one soil moisture sensor cs616 campbell scientific was installed midway between plates at 5 cm depth note however that the net storage at daily time steps was small and was not included in the energy budgets each ec assembly was raised during the season as needed to maintain a minimum 1 m offset ec azimuths were set due south at s8 and j118 and due west at s1 s2 s5 s6 and h8 to reduce instances of self obstructed airflow predominant winds were from the western half of the compass at yuma and from the south at maricopa each station collected multiple micrometeorological observations 108 variables per time step at 20 hz sample rates configured under campbell

station functioning was monitored daily via cell phone modem links data were stored on compact flash cf cards that were changed approximately every 2 weeks subsequent processing of fluxes used r scripts to remove data spikes and fill data gaps spike removal followed the methodology described by vickers and mahrt 1996 gap filling was needed to avoid under estimation of et the nature of the gaps varied for station and site and except for station relocations were unpredictable sometimes the irga would fail but not the sonic other times both failed and on still other occasions inexplicably self resolved gap filling techniques have been reported in reviewed in literature e g 15 of them by moffat et al 2007 the best approach would be to adopt one or more of those but time did not allow testing and implementation for all sensor and data collection maladies hence linear interpolation of relevant and co variant variables was employed where feasible meaning that fluxes were reconstructed from fundamental observables such as wind speed air temperature and humidity if available from ancillary instruments for example when the irga failed but not the sonic h fluxes were estimated by computing air density and heat capacity via independent slow response temperature humidity sensors for long duration time gaps more than 2 h linear interpolation to 30 minute time steps was not done and an alternative strategy had to be used in these cases gap filling was done daily since variability at shorter time steps was high energy balance closure was enforced using the bowen

and high temporal frequencies weekly or better multispectral data were needed to create vegetation indices critically ndvi nir red nir red from red 670 nm and near infrared 800 nm reflectance high spatial resolution was needed to resolve wheat fields without significant field edge effects high temporal frequencies were needed track the rapidly changing wheat canopy and to maintain good time resolution despite cloudy sky events data from two satellite sensors table 8 met these requirements sentinel 2 a b www esa int applications observing the earth copernicus sentinel 2 for 2017 and 2018 yuma data and venus https www theia land fr en product venus for the 2019 maricopa data incorporation of additional observations from landsat 7 and 8 would improve temporal sampling however they were not included due to the need for additional analyses to accommodate coarser 30 m spatial resolution and similar but not identical spectral sampling these differences complicate the generation of a unified ndvi time series sentinel 2 a b is a pair of identical satellites collectively observing identical targets weekly they are multispectral pushbroom instruments in sun synchronous orbits with overpass times in arizona at 11am data for ndvi have 10 m resolution orthorectified 100 km x 100 km tiles with top of atmosphere toa reflectance l1c were downloaded from usgs earthexplorer usgs gov because utm zone 12 is used for all arizona sites as part of usda maricopa lab gis protocol yuma area images needed to be re projected yuma lies slightly west of the nominal zone 12 boundary of 114 w for this task the gdal gdal org package gdalwarp as implemented in rgdal was used sentinel 2 ndvi values were generated from top of atmosphere toa bands 4 and 8 atmospherically corrected reflectance data are generally preferred and were used for the venus sensor data as noted below because the resulting indices are more representative of actual vegetation conditions than those derived from uncorrected data this preference however created a difficult to resolve data processing challenge tools such as 6s sen2agri and maja a package combining the multi sensor atmospheric correction and cloud screening maccs and atcor hagolle et al 2015 could have been used but necessary local atmospheric data and computer hardware were not available for consistency this unavailability suggested that all analyses be conducted using less than optimal toa data on the other hand if the effects of atmospheric corrections upon et estimates could be quantified then a compromise could be made toa data could be included while not losing results where surface reflectance data were available to show the viability of this latter approach we evaluated the effects of atmospheric corrections on four key parameters ndvi ndvin eq 1 kcb and etc using venus theia cnes fr data the venus project enabled the evaluation since it provides both 5 m top of atmosphere reflectance l1c and maja generated 10 m surface reflectance l2a data two regions from 2019 were considered the maricopa wheat field h8 and yuma wheat fields s1 s2 s5 s6 and s8 note that wheat grown at yuma in 2019 was not part of the ground study which meant that etc estimates from the atmospheric comparison study were compared but not validated the full wheat season late december 2018 to early june 2019 were assessed with 49 scenes over maricopa and 79 over yuma we show below that use of top of atmosphere data filtered to include only scenes with no visible clouds introduces small 5 bias errors for wheat grown in 2019 at maricopa venus microsatellite data were used data not available over yuma for the 2018 sites venus table 8 has similar spectral responses to sentinel 2 but is superior in several ways higher spatial resolution 5 10 m nadir resolution vs 20 60 m 2 day constant view angle acquisitions vs 5 10 day overpass frequency and availability of both top of atmosphere and atmospherically corrected reflectances consequently the potential temporal sampling intervals were greatly improved over alternative sensors orthorectified 27 km x 27 km multispectral l2a 10 m surface reflectance were used having noted a preference for atmospherically corrected reflectance images it also needs to be noted their use introduces a different side effect high sensitivity to noise in the red band since healthy vegetation has very low reflectivity in the red band noise in this spectral region can leadto anomalously high ndvi values one compensation approach for this outcome is to apply a constant offset to the red reflectance hagolle et al 2015 labo obs mip fr multitemp using ndvi with atmospherically corrected data to create a revised ndvi denoted acorvi 5 acorvi nir red 0 05 nir red 0 05 the suggested offset 0 05 is chosen to be small yet greater than the standard deviation of atmospheric correction uncertainty typically 0 01 this study used eq 5 for all venus acquisitions but report them as ndvi below 2 4 estimation of transpiration and evapotranspiration using vegetation indices we use the empirical vegetation index for the southwestern us visw french et al 2018 to transform remotely sensed reflectance maps into daily evapotranspiration visw uses ndvi as a proxy for the basal crop coefficient kcb thus instead of using standardized estimates of vegetation cover one uses observations from satellite or airborne images and an empirical transformation developed by hunsaker et al 2005b and 2007 fig 1 table 1 i e 6 kcb min 0 15 0 176 1 325 ndvin 1 466 ndvin 2 1 146 ndvin 3 where ndvin is normalized ndvi as calculated in eq 1 for the present study the ndvimin and ndvimax values used to estimate the kcb for field sites are the lower and upper ndvi limits rigorous criteria for optimal limit selection do not exist hence objective thresholds based on observations were used we selected probability levels of 10 and 90 from the empirical ndvi distributions as defined in fao56 when potential effects of water stress on etc are considered actual etc etc act is computed as 7 etc act ks kcb ke eto where kcb represents crop transpiration tc ke is a coefficient for soil evaporation ks is the water stress coefficient and eto is grass reference evapotranspiration for the yuma sites we limit evaluation of the model equation 5 above to only estimate kcb with satellite ndvi and thus calculate only the tc portion of etc that is kcb times eto ks was not computed but assumed as 1 0 since we did not model the soil water balance swb thus water stress if any was not accounted for in the yuma tc estimates however for the maricopa field h8 having more frequent ndvi acquisitions simulated daily swb estimates i e a separate root zone and surface soil layer swb were made these enabled estimation of actual etc by evaluating ke and ks using the fao56 dual crop coefficient procedures parameters for calculating ke were based on the soil evaporation characteristics given in fao56 for the sandy clay loam soil at h8 fraction of soil wetted by irrigation and precipitation was set to 1 0 crop height and crop rooting depth were increased proportionately with estimated kcb until maximum values of 0 90 and 1 5 m respectively were reached maximum values referred to in fao56 for wheat similarly crop cover was increased to a maximum of 0 99 at maximum kcb but was allowed to decrease proportionately with kcb during late season senescence the soil water depletion fraction for no water stress p was set to 0 55 for etc act 5 0 mm day 1 and adjusted daily for atmospheric demand per fao56 table 22 and footnote 2 in computation ks taw dr 1 p taw where taw is total available water in the root zone mm and dr is the root zone depletion mm statistical comparisons between daily observed etc and either tc s sites or etc act h site were evaluated separately over different growth stages as well as for the entire wheat season growth stages were estimated based on evaluation of seasonal observed kc tends as described in the next section for each site statistics were analyzed over the initial and development mid season and late season stages analyses included linear correlation and root mean square error rmse mean difference md mean absolute difference mad and percent mad madp relative to the observed mean 2 5 measured and estimated crop coefficients daily values of the single crop coefficient kc were calculated for sites by dividing the observed daily etc from eddy covariance by daily eto segmented linear fao56 kc curves were derived by visually fitting the kc data to the initial mid season and late season growth stages the model estimated kcb for the yuma sites and the kcb and kc h8 site only were compared to the observed kc 2 6 evapotranspiration terminology to summarize this study compared evapotranspiration estimates from eddy covariance stations denoted observed etc against vegetation index based estimates derived from satellites in two different ways for all yuma sites model estimates represent just the transpiration component of etc and are denoted as tc for the maricopa site h8 modeling incorporated a soil water balance and results there are indicated as etc act 3 results 3 1 daily eddy covariance etc and eto eddy covariance data from all seven sites were quality checked unrealistic values were removed time data gaps filled energy balance enforced then outputs were compared with eto daily observed etc plots fig 3 display the timing of data gaps in terms of sample counts where non gap days over 48 30 minute samples are shown in blue continuously gapped days 0 samples are in black three of the sites s2 s6 and h8 had few gaps and could mostly be filled by linear interpolation the other four sites s8 j118 s1 and s5 had longer duration gaps and required multiple correction procedures gaps at s8 and s5 were almost exclusively due to loss of irga but not sonic values for these missing le data were estimated by energy balance residuals gap filling at s1 was done by a fortuitous arrangement with s2 an adjacent site with the same planting date and similar irrigation history in this case linear regressions between the s1 and s2 flux components during non gapped times were used to create predictions to fill s1 gaps the j118 site was the most problematic case three different procedures were needed to fill gaps linear interpolation was done for gaps less than 2 h le fluxes were computed by residuals for early and mid season times while for late times gap filling was done only at daily time intervals and used estimated crop coefficients this last step was done by using azmet yuma north gila eto values computing kc at the bounds of the data gap and then linearly interpolating the product kc x eto closure was computed for all stations at daily time steps a procedure that reduces energy storage effects then fit with linear models reported in table 9 are the summary statistics for each site on the left half and cumulative monthly feb may observed etc mm before and after correction via eq 2 average monthly observed etc error considering all months dec jun was 37 mm which means that closure corrected cumulative observed etc values were 30 greater than un corrected observations eddy covariance data over wheat for all three years showed consistent patterns of early season observed etc at 1 mm day ramping up to over 8 mm day mid season then rapidly dropping to 1 mm day on senescence comparisons between observed etc which includes both vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation and weather station derived eto are shown for all 7 sites in fig 4 for 2017 fig 5 for 2018 and fig 6 for 2019 where solid symbols indicate observed etc from eddy covariance observations and open symbols represent eto calculated from yuma north gila and maricopa azmet stations observed etc usually falls below eto until doy 60 then closely tracks it for the remainder of the season until senescence spikes in observed etc of 2 0 or more mm day above the trend generally coincide with preceding irrigation or precipitation events also shown in figs 4 6 most notable for high observed etc to eto ratios during early season were the s8 site in yuma 2016 17 fig 4a and the h8 site in maricopa 2018 19 fig 6 both sites in their respective wheat years experienced an irrigation immediately after planting and significantly more precipitation events early in the wheat season as compared to other sites and years cumulative observed etc ranged from 499 mm to 684 mm table 10 3 2 satellite based ndvi time series ndvi over wheat showed patterns similar to observed etc with a nearly flat trend before emergence a rapid increase close to maximum values at doy 50 60 a 30 day plateau region then an abrupt 10 20 day ndvi decline on senescence however there were significant differences between fields when examining details in 2017 s8 s earlier and more vigorous plant growth showed ndvi values rising above 0 8 and remaining above the later planted j118 site until april fig 7 dashed lines indicate threshold ndvi values for each site the different planting dates of fields at s1 6 are readily apparent for the 2018 sites fig 8 for these fields irrigation cut off led to nearly simultaneous senescence and nearly simultaneous ndvi drops the range for non atmospherically corrected values are compressed values ranging 0 1 0 82 for the 2019 h8 site fig 9 all 8 borders closely tracked each other with ndvi ranging from 0 0 to 0 9 a result of using atmospherically corrected observations highlighted by the dashed lines is an interval of crop water stress that is represented by an ndvi drop of about 5 the persistence of clear skies in combination with soil water balance modeling discussed below supports this interpretation 3 3 daily observed etc vs estimated tc and etc act applying the ndvi to kcb transformations resulted in time series modeled tc yuma sites and etc maricopa site values that closely track observed etc for 2017 fig 10 a and 10b for 2018 fig 11 a to 11d for yuma sites and 2019 fig 12 for h8 in maricopa trends previously observed are mimicked by ndvi implemented modeling where many of the irrigation events are represented by spikes in both etc and satellite based ndvi the h8 site for 2019 shows the average modeled etc act of the 8 borders along with observed etc at h8 fig 12 results from estimated tc and etc for the 2018 and 2019 seasons showed seasonal patterns where vi derived estimates closely agreed with observed etc at mid season but consistently underestimated etc at early and late growth seasons estimated tc non adjusted for water stress for early season conditions at yuma sites in 2017 fig 10 and 2018 fig 11 are consistent with expectations for sparse cover tc is low while etc is relatively high due to soil evaporation observed etc for all four s sites in 2018 increased above estimated tc following irrigations applied on day of year doy 40 for s1 and s2 fig 11a and b doy 30 for s5 fig 11c and doy 53 for s6 fig 11d starting in early march 2018 consistency among all four sites is restored about doy 65 at near full cover and when tc and etc should be nearly the same estimated tc agrees well with measured etc during the later season doy after 110 tc underestimates measured etc suggesting higher soil evaporation at late season irrigation when crop cover is reduced for 2017 seasonal total estimated tc is within 20 mm of total observed etc at s8 but was 73 mm less for j118 table 10 seasonal total estimated tc for yuma site s2 is close within 16 mm to total observed etc however for sites s1 s5 and s6 total tc is 52 110 mm less than total observed etc suggesting more soil evaporation may have occurred at those sites particularly during the early season at the maricopa field fig 12 where etc act was estimated agreement was very good except for underestimated etc for doy between 20 and 35 total estimated etc act was only 17 mm less than observed total at h8 as alluded to earlier concerning water stress at h8 according to the swb model the estimated etc act was reduced by water stress ks 1 0 for ten days at the end of a 21 day lapse without irrigation or significant rain i e from doy 98 107 this period is mid season when wheat etc is high the estimated water stress during this period reduced the estimated etc by about 17 mm from a non stress condition while observed etc also declined during this 10 day period reduction was greater for etc act fig 12 the statistical correlations and mean differences between daily estimated tc or etc and the observed etc for different growth stages and for all stages combined are shown for the 2017 yuma sites table 11 and for the 2018 sites in yuma and the 2019 site in maricopa table 12 the 2017 results indicate that estimated daily tc was less than observed etc during initial development stages with a madp of 37 39 as expected based on the daily estimated and observed values shown in fig 10 agreement at s8 and j118 was much better during the mid season stage madp within 14 although mean tc was higher than observed mean etc for s8 the trend remained for s8 during the late season suggesting observed etc may have experienced water stress that was unaccounted for by the tc estimates based on rather large gaps in ndvi data for 2018 observed data were well correlated high r value and rmse 0 45 mm d for s1 s2 and s5 during the initial development period and less correlated for s6 and h8 the higher correlations indicate that the daily trends for estimated tc were similar to those for observed etc during the early growth stages though mean daily tc was much lower than mean observed etc as indicated by the madp 36 40 for s1 s2 and s5 although the estimated tc for s6 and etc act for h8 were not as well correlated with daily observed during the early growth stages the madp was about the same for s6 and even lower for h8 28 compared with the three other s sites smaller r values and higher rmse during mid season than early season for the four s sites indicate that daily values of estimated tc were generally less aligned with daily observed fluctuations daily etc act and observed etc were better correlated during mid season than during earlier stages for all sites the absolute differences between estimated and observed were smallest during the mid season varying in madp from 13 to 18 tables 11 and 12 late season r values were relatively high at all sites indicating an agreement in trend between estimated and observed the daily values absolute agreement based on madp 19 22 was best for s5 and for the h8 site when etc act was estimated considering the daily data for the entire season estimated data were well correlated and similar for all sites and years where r values were 0 85 91 and rmse were near 1 0 mm d mean absolute differences for the entire season were from 0 78 to 1 07 mm d indicating estimated values were about 20 23 less than observed for the season the total irrigation applied to wheat borders at the six yuma sites table 10 were generally not much higher than the total observed etc albeit with one exception at j118 otherwise total irrigation varied from 34 mm less to 191 mm more than total etc indicating high irrigation efficiencies in contrast to these irrigation at the maricopa h8 site was less efficient with total irrigation exceeding total etc by over 1000 mm the grower at h8 realized something had changed in his organic wheat borders that made the water advance times much slower than in the previous year the lowest grain yield for all sites was at j118 in 2017 table 10 which was a smaller field with a much sandier soil profile below 0 15 m than the other sites because of the high infiltration rate in j118 the field had to be irrigated at high flow rates which ultimately led to exceedingly high irrigation depths relative to etc the relatively low yield for h8 organic wheat could reflect deep leaching of nutrients due to excessive irrigation 3 4 daily observed kc and modeled kcb and kc high observed kc during early season for s8 in 2016 2017 fig 13 a reflects soil evaporation due to the post plant irrigation and the frequent occurrence of precipitation during dec jan in contrast j118 planted in mid jan 2017 without a post plant irrigation had lower observed kc during the early stages of growth fig 13b at mid season average kc at s8 was 1 06 but observed kc likely declined during mid season between doy 77 84 due to water stress in contrast average kc during mid season for j118 was only 0 92 and daily values were similar to modeled kcb until doy 100 when kcb rapidly declined relative to observed kc end of season observed kc was similar for s8 and j118 about 0 30 the measured kc for the s1 s2 s5 and s6 yuma sites in 2018 showed similar trends with time fig 14 however the measured kc data during the early season for these sites were variable with generally lower observed kc at the s1 site fig 14a and s2 site fig 14b than at s5 fig 14c and s6 fig 14d for all the s sites in 2018 except s6 which was planted later kc spikes high following a rain on doy 9 and 10 albeit the two day kc spike in s5 appeared unrealistically high for s6 the observed kc spiked from doy 55 60 following irrigation application although these spikes corresponded to a time of low crop cover indicated by the low ndvi at the time for s6 in fig 8 they were higher than expected thus fitting an fao56 initial horizontal kc was difficult due to the variable early season kc data measured kc reached maximum values at mid season from about doy 40 70 depending on planting date for s sites and then kc plateaued fluctuating about the fitted horizontal mid season fao56 curve fig 14 obvious declines in kc data occurred after mid season starting around doy 130 140 for s1 s2 and s6 and around doy 120 for s5 which was planted earlier than the other s sites the kc data at the estimated mid season growth averaged 1 14 for s1 1 05 for s2 and s6 and 1 10 for s5 those values are the same as the estimated fao56 mid season segment shown in each figure end of season kc varied from about 0 20 to 0 30 for the s sites indicating the dry soil condition prior to harvest estimated kcb values derived from satellite ndvi show some overestimation from doy 40 90 and underestimation after doy 110 relative to the kc for s1 fig 14a the estimated kcb for s2 fig 14b appears to be closely representative of actual kc data during development where kcb is about 0 10 lower than kc though kcb then becomes higher than kc for a period during mid season the estimated kcb values are much lower than kc during initial through development stages for s5 and s6 likely indicating that soil evaporation was higher at those sites than s1 and s2 during mid season and late estimated kcb is consistent with measured kc for s5 for s6 mid season kcb fits the measured data well with some underestimation during late season comparison of the seasonal totals of measured etc show good agreement with the estimated total tc table 10 for the s sites in 2018 showing total tc was less than etc by 16 110 mm depending on site for the maricopa site fig 15 an initial fao56 kc line was not given due to very high early season measured kc caused by significant rain during january 2019 the kc during development period doy 10 50 for h8 was also skewed when frequent rain occurred the estimated fao56 mid season kc for h8 in 2019 was 1 1 higher than those in yuma in 2018 the end of season kc was about 0 40 the swb and vi based modeled daily kc was not consistent with observed kc during the rainy development period however it was close to the observed data during mid season the modeled kc captured the decline in kc due to water stress between doy 98 and 107 and the increased jump in observed kc following the irrigation on doy 108 as mentioned earlier total observed etc was 17 mm more than total modeled etc table 10 indicating good seasonal agreement estimated seasonal evaporation for h8 was about 65 mm similar to the difference in total etc and tc at the s5 and s6 sites 3 5 assessment of satellite based ndvi lastly a parallel study assessed the importance of atmospheric correction to satellite reflectance data and specifically to resulting et estimates as expected ndvi values were found strongly affected but subsequent effects were greatly reduced after ndvi normalization results from analysis over the h8 site at maricopa are shown in fig 16 a and for the s wheat sites at yuma in fig 16b red symbols represent parameters derived from non corrected l1c venus data while blue symbols are corresponding parameters for corrected l2a data the adjusted ndvi denoted acorvi on top panels are sensitive to atmospheric corrections where the range of indices are reduced by 25 40 when the acorvi values are normalized using eq 1 and vi limits at 10 and 90 quantiles ndvin estimates from l1c mostly agree within 5 of l2a data for both sites normalization at yuma led to thresholding at full canopy a contributing factor to the small differences observed at mid season transformations to kcb are shown in the third panels of fig 16a and 16b at the maricopa h 8 site normalization thresholds for l1c data over estimate surface reflectance in the early and mid seasons while the over estimations occur in the late season for yuma sites a difference possibly due to differing soil reflectivity daily etc values bottom most panels are obtained by linearly interpolating satellite derived kcb values to daily time steps then multiplying these by eto obtained from azmet data daily etc estimates differ by less than 1 mm day and cumulative full season et indicated on left side of each panel by 30 mm this two site test indicated that use of top of atmosphere satellite data after normalization is likely to result in etc estimation errors on the order of 5 or less 4 discussion results from the arizona wheat studies demonstrated the practicality and accuracy of the spaceborne ndvi based kcb model to estimate daily and seasonal crop water use of wheat usable satellite scenes ranged between 25 and 65 per growing season which corresponds to a realized periodicity of 3 7 days this high cadence possible because of sentinel 2 and venus capabilities and a favorable clear sky environment enabled excellent tracking of wheat canopy growth considering 7 sites visited over 2016 2019 using eddy covariance observations the study estimated total etc in the range of 499 684 mm values less than total irrigation on the order of 50 100 mm for s1 s6 sites and 201 mm for s8 suggesting reasonable irrigation efficiencies at those sites notable exceptions in irrigation efficiency occurred at h8 where applied irrigations exceeded observed etc by over 1000 mm and j118 where irrigations exceeded etc by nearly 1500 mm these differences highlight that ec monitoring generally cannot capture highly inefficient scheduling absent slow infiltration conditions comparing total observed etc for seven sites in arizona to remotely sensed estimates showed agreement within 16 110 mm over the growing season and estimates were consistent with the seasonal etc value of 655 mm provided by erie et al 1982 for the southwestern us this indicates that satellite based vi offers a good way to estimate seasonal etc once relationships with ec data have been tested when assessing within season water use there were differences in performance of the vi based estimates in early vs mid late periods mid season observed kc values ranged from 1 05 to 1 14 for sites that were considered not highly water stressed and values are consistent with literature findings for wheat reported by pereira et al 2020 this special issue which ranged from 1 0 1 3 based on the fao56 grass reference eto observed end of season kc varied from about 0 2 to 0 4 considering the yuma and maricopa sites range in values reported for end of season wheat kc in the literature review by pereira et al 2020 are from 0 1 to 0 4 for low moisture grain agreement between tc and etc estimates obtained via sentinel 2 and venus observations respectively agreed well with ec observations after the first 50 60 days of growth on the other hand early season tc and etc estimates in 2016 2019 60 days were erratic and not as reliable an outcome to be expected in part because sparse vegetation cover contributes a noisy and weak signal to the ndvi time series note that had an alternate linear formulation for kcb been used drerup et al 2017 er raki et al 2007 early season tc and etc estimates would also be less than observed additional reasons for worse early season performance were the occurrences of soil surface evaporation from rainfall events and some ec sensor failures soil evaporation could be better accommodated with thermal remote sensing with sensors such as landsat and ecostress errors induced by equipment failure emphasize the difficulty of data gap filling lacking sufficient thermal data utilization of fao56 methods allen et al 1998 to estimate kc remains preferred for the early season irrigation scheduling this may also include the need to construct an appropriate localized segmented fao56 kc curve to estimate etc until satellite ndvi are deemed reliable e g 60 days after planting when irrigation scheduling starts in earnest in arizona a notable finding from the study was a demonstration of the ability to use ndvi to detect water stress commonly one assumes that the ndvi signal is too imprecise to be used for abnormal plant water conditions and for such cases thermal infrared sensing should be used in a ground based study over wheat jackson et al 1982 reported no immediate resolution of water stress with any of the tested indices data from this study indicate that is not necessarily true results from the 2017 yuma sites s8 and j118 and the 2019 maricopa h8 sites showed that for irrigated seasonal crops such as wheat a combination of frequent well calibrated high spatial resolution visible near infrared remote sensing can resolve water stress for the maricopa event a clear and persistent 5 drop in ndvi occurred within 2 days of soil water balance model predicted stress one can foresee an operational system with short latency that could detect and forecast water stress events based on a collection of frequent ndvi data supported by a background soil water balance model although the study did not investigate swb status at the 2017 yuma s8 and j118 sites stress may be indicated there too by ndvi in these instances the indicators could be anomalous depressions at short and long duration time scales thus for non standard conditions quantile selection for ndvi normalization won t be sufficient for crop coefficient estimation instead historical or spatially contextual selection of ndvi limits would be needed required conditions to make detection feasible and reliable include accurate atmospheric corrections to the time series accurate satellite calibration similar satellite view angles for all overpasses high spatial 10 m or better resolution and frequent overpasses 7 days this latter aspect which venus eminently provided with 2 day sampling demonstrates the value of high cadence imaging with frequent images trend persistence adds confidence that the observations are real and not acquisitional or processing artifacts less frequent images separated by a week or more would make it more likely that stress signals would remain unrecognized because of small sample sizes and the increased probability of confounding rainfall or irrigation events the availability of frequent images also suggests a change in analysis time series should not be smoothed with filters such as savitzky golay savitzky and golay 1964 because that step would reduce or remove the stress signals 5 conclusions a three year study was undertaken to evaluate and validate tc and etc over irrigated durum wheat using a previously developed basal crop coefficient model based on vegetation indices that were derived in this study from spaceborne platforms comparisons based on eddy covariance etc observations indicated the remotely sensed modeled values agreed very well for the total season and for most of the growing season with best agreement during mid season measured single crop coefficients at mid season and end of season for durum wheat were consistent to those presented in the original fao56 table and to those updated in the present special issue agreement was not as good for early season wheat growth an outcome consistent with the limited ability of vis to detect soil evaporation and to accurately represent transpiration over sparse cover the latter results suggest that additional methods such as fao56 procedures to handle initial kc values or additional measurements will be needed to supplement vi based etc capabilities prior to effective wheat cover however mid season etc can be accurately modeled with vi based approaches even during water stress events the results strengthen existing reports on fao56 mid season crop coefficients to use for wheat additional studies in environments different from the u s southwest are needed to show that the vi methodology is broadly applicable for wheat grown elsewhere in addition the satellite based approach described in this study is under evaluation for lettuce spinach melon and cotton the aim is to demonstrate its potential

10564,sunflower helianthus annuus l is an important edible oilseed crop that is frequently exposed to drought stress due to lack and unpredictability of precipitation sprinkler irrigation si is a promising approach for improving yield under limited availability of water but is often associated with increased risk of root lodging the irrigation water can soften the upper soil layer and increase the torque of the aboveground portion of the crop this study aims to evaluate the effect of si and nitrogen n application rate on grain yield water use efficiency wue and root lodging resistance of sunflower the risk of root lodging was evaluated by a safety factor sf indicator the results showed that soil water content was 13 4 and 19 1 higher under si in comparison with rainfed rf conditions in 2018 and 2019 respectively when averaged across the whole measured period sprinkler irrigation exhibited 12 higher mean grain yield than rf conditions across both years p 0 05 although wue was not influenced the yield advantage under si was supported by strong relationships of grain yield with harvest index aboveground biomass and yield components a positive yield response to increasing n rate from 0 to 180 kg n ha 1 was evidenced beyond which no response was observed root lodging resistance in terms of sf increased with higher n application rate due to decrease in anchorage strength root lodging resistance between si and rf treatments was not significantly different due to the trade off between anchorage strength and self weight moment although irrigation water under si weakened the soil shear strength and reduced the anchorage strength estimated by a theoretical model taken together si in combination with an n rate of 180 kg ha 1 could be recommended to mitigate drought stress and improve grain yield and root lodging resistance of sunflower keywords deficit irrigation root lodging water use efficiency nitrogen management 1 introduction improvement of grain yield and oil content of sunflower is required to keep pace with the increasing consumer demand flagella et al 2002 rauf et al 2017 sunflower production is mostly limited by frequent exposure to drought flagella et al 2002 wu et al 2018 the occurrence of drought is unpredictable as it mainly depends on the amount of rainfall and its distribution in rainfed regions worldwide li et al 2016 uncertainties in weather conditions can result in decreasing efficient rainfall coupled with increasing evapotranspiration thus it is imperative to effectively tackle the issue of increasing irrigation water scarcity by optimizing irrigation management that can offset unpredictable and limited precipitation heumesser et al 2012 koech and langat 2018 however local producers tend to use the conventional over irrigation system to maximize yield performance which often leads to large amount of irrigation water consumption and low water use efficiency wue rai et al 2017 ebrahimian et al 2019 the optimization of irrigation management can be achieved through the adoption of sprinkler irrigation si rodrigues et al 2013 the key implication of si is applying irrigation water through showers resembling natural rainfall which facilitates uniform distribution of water over the field soil rodrigues et al 2013 darko et al 2017 rai et al 2017 most studies have indicated that the estimated water consumption under si is almost half of that under surface irrigation rai et al 2017 koech and langat 2018 zou et al 2020 therefore si utilizes less water than that needed to fully satisfy the crop water requirements and thus enhances wue and economic returns rodrigues et al 2013 previous studies have optimized si practices for several crops including zea mays zou et al 2020 oryza sativa pinto et al 2020 gossypium spp wang et al 2018 and triticum aestivum yan et al 2019 however si has not been extensively exploited or applied for sunflower in dry semi humid regions nitrogen n is not only the most important macronutrient for crop growth and development but also plays a key role in determining the final yield performance of sunflower zubriski and zimmerman 1974 freire et al 2019 previous studies have suggested a synergistic association between n and water because higher n application rate can increase crop metabolism and root hydraulic conductance which enhance water availability and the nutritional effectiveness of n and phosphorus simultaneously wu and ma 2015 shah and wu 2019 yang et al 2020 however excessive n fertilization can decrease crop yield n use efficiency and economic return and increase greenhouse gas emissions wu et al 2019 therefore appropriate n fertilizer management could be combined with irrigation management synergistically to improve n use efficiency wue and grain yield with minimal environmental risk wang et al 2018 freire et al 2019 yan et al 2019 crop lodging is a common problem and the main constraint in improving sunflower yield under favorable weather conditions especially when excessive n and water are applied ennos et al 1993 goodman and ennos 1999 berry et al 2004 lodging suppresses the photosynthetic ability disrupts grain filling reduces achene weight and thereby reduces grain yield and quality pinthus 1973 wu and ma 2016 kendall et al 2017 lodging in sunflower is generally categorized as root lodging and stem lodging both of which have been commonly reported due to failure of the root anchorage system or the tensile failure of the stem sposaro et al 2010 the susceptibility of root and stem lodging depends on complex interactions between the biomechanical and morphological characteristics of the stems and roots and the torque of the aboveground parts of the crops that capture wind and rain sposaro et al 2010 manzur et al 2014 previous studies suggested that population density genotype crop growth stage soil property and agronomic management showed significant effect on these variables and thereby influenced lodging resistance in sunflower sposaro et al 2008 pinthus 1973 root lodging root failure is initiated by failure of the root soil anchorage system and displacement of the root system ennos et al 1993 sposaro et al 2008 under irrigated conditions a large portion of crop lodging could be attributed to root lodging rather than stem lodging stem buckling because of heavy top weight and lack of support due to softened soil in the root zone ennos et al 1993 piñera chavez et al 2016 yang and zheng 2016 nevertheless sposaro et al 2010 and hall et al 2010 reported that stem lodging can be at high risk in well anchored plants when the external force applied to the aboveground part of plants is beyond the stem failure moment both si and n fertilizer management have major impact on the morphological and mechanical parameters of aboveground plant parts structure of the root system and soil properties that are associated with root lodging resistance berry et al 2004 wu et al 2019 however the effects of si n fertilizer and their combination on root lodging resistance and the associated mechanisms in sunflower are unclear although this has been studied partly in other species such as cereal crops pinthus 1973 wu et al 2019 it is hypothesized that si could influence the risk of root lodging via two pathways 1 si could moisten and soften the upper soil layer which in turn reduce the soil shear strength and manipulate root architecture which is detrimental for anchorage of the root system and 2 si could influence crop growth habits and phenotypic traits and thereby change the torque self weight moment of the aboveground part of the crop we also hypothesize that excessive n fertilizer application increases the risk of root lodging because of greater plant height and self weight moment and a decreased root system although the breaking resistance and flexural rigidity could be increased in some cases wu et al 2018 2019 this study aims to 1 determine the effect of si and n application rate on grain yield and wue and clarify whether si could be adopted for sunflower production and 2 unravel the impact of si and n application rate on root lodging resistance and its underlying mechanisms by employing a standardized protocol 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description a field experiment was conducted in 2018 and repeated in an adjacent field in 2019 at the sanyuan experimental station of northwest a f university 34 36 n 108 52 e the experimental site was located in the guanzhong plain of shaanxi province which has a dry semi humid climate before the field experiment the topsoil 0 30 cm contained 21 7 g kg 1 organic matter 1 31 g kg 1 total n 1 19 g kg 1 total p 23 8 g kg 1 total k 10 7 mg kg 1 olsen p and 299 mg kg 1 soil available k and had a ph of 8 4 the soil texture was clay loam based on the usda classification weather data including precipitation and minimum and maximum air temperatures during the sunflower growing season in both years at the experimental site were obtained from an automatic weather station fig 1 2 2 experimental design and cultural practices the experiment comprised a factorial arrangement of irrigation regimes n treatments in a split plot design with three replications in both years the main plots consisted of two irrigation regimes including rainfed rf conditions and si for the si treatment the relevant details of the irrigation system installed by huawei water saving technology group co ltd shanghai china are provided in fig 2 the lateral pipes with emitters spaced 20 cm apart were positioned in the same direction as the row of sunflower the flow of water driven by a pressurized water pump into the si plots began at approximately 09 00 h every 10 d and continued for 30 min with a total flow rate of about 10 mm wu and ma 2016 each plot designated to si treatment was irrigated nine times during both years and the accumulated irrigation water was 95 and 90 mm in 2018 and 2019 respectively no supplemental irrigation was applied in the rf plots the subplots consisted of four n rates 0 120 180 and 240 kg n ha 1 nitrogen fertilizer as urea 46 n was split applied at 0 20 and 40 d after sowing das with a splitting pattern of 50 30 20 the basal n fertilizer was broadcasted on the soil surface and was incorporated into the soil within one day after application the remaining n fertilizer was top dressed according to the abovementioned schedule by hand while executing si phosphorus at 40 kg p2o5 ha 1 and potassium at 50 kg k ha 1 were applied as basal fertilizer in all plots using calcium superphosphate and potassium chloride respectively the widely adopted commercial sunflower hybrid chicy102 was used in both years the seed was sown on 14 june 2018 and 13 may 2019 and harvested on 13 september 2018 and 14 august 2018 the row to row and plant to plant spacing was 60 40 cm in 2018 and 60 35 cm in 2019 all subplots had an area of 24 0 m2 6 m long and 4 m wide other agronomic practices followed standard procedures suited to this region 2 3 measurements and calculations 2 3 1 soil moisture and water use efficiency soil volumetric water content svwc at the 20 cm soil depth was measured at 1 h intervals automatically by a hobo data station h21 002 onset computer corporation bourne ma usa that was connected to a soil moisture sensor smc m005 onset computer corporation bourne ma usa before sowing and after harvesting soil samples were taken at 20 cm increments to a depth of 200 cm from all plots using an auger then gravimetric water content was determined by drying the soil at 105 c to a constant weight the average soil bulk densities were 1 05 1 27 11 8 and 13 6 g cm 3 for the 0 20 20 80 80 160 and 160 200 cm soil layers respectively li et al 2016 total soil water storage sws in the 0 200 cm depth was calculated as follows 1 s w s i 1 n ρ i θ i h i where n is the number of soil layers ρi g cm 3 is soil bulk density that was previously reported by li et al 2016 θi g g 1 is gravimetric water content and hi mm is thickness of the ith soil layer evapotranspiration et for the entire sunflower growing season was determined as follows 2 e t p s w d i d r where p mm is total precipitation during the crop growing season swd soil water depletion mm is the difference in sws of the 0 200 cm soil layer between harvesting and sowing i mm is the total irrigation amount d is the amount of water that percolated deeply and r is surface runoff both d and r were considered to be negligible in this experiment as the field had loamy clay soil with high field capacity 26 and the groundwater table was 20 m below the soil surface li et al 2016 the wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated as grain yield kg ha 1 divided by et mm 2 3 2 measurements and calculations for root lodging the lodging related traits were recorded in each plot at 15 d before physiological maturity in both years firstly five representative plants were tagged and cut off at 50 cm above the ground level a simulated root lodging test was performed on the remaining stem base of each plant according to wu and ma 2018 using a custom made lodging meter originated from a mecmesin digital force gauge mecmesin slinfold uk the restoring anchorage strength sr supplied by the total root system was recorded when the basal stem was pushed at a rotation speed of 2 0 s 1 to a 30 angle from its vertical position the basal stem was then cut at the ground level and combined with its corresponding aboveground plant part as a whole the whole plant was then balanced on a thin metal tube and the distance between the balance point and the base end was recorded as the height of the center of gravity hr plant height was measured as the distance between the soil surface and the top of the plant fresh weight of the total plant mr was recorded immediately after harvesting the stem diameter at the basal position of the stem was measured by a digital caliper after the simulated root lodging test the root soil ball was carefully extracted by a spade and root plate diameter was recorded according to the method described by wu and ma 2016 safety factor for root lodging sf was calculated as 3 sf sr mr where sr is root anchorage strength nm as described by wu and ma 2018 parameter mr is the self weight moment nm at θo from the vertical which was calculated as 4 mr sinθ hr mr g where θ is the inclination angle from the vertical stand hr is the height of the center of gravity cm mr is fresh weight g and g is the acceleration due to gravity n kg 1 the higher the value of sf the greater the root lodging resistance of the tested plants was this sf method can be applied to evaluate susceptibility of root lodging of most self supporting crops ennos et al 1993 wu and ma 2018 root lodging instead of stem lodging was considered in the present study mainly because root lodging is more prevalent than stem buckling in sunflower under irrigated conditions ennos et al 1993 sposaro et al 2008 a theoretical model was also used to estimate the anchorage strength crook and ennos 1993 by integrating the soil shear strength and root plate diameter as 5 sr kτd3 where k is a dimensionless constant τ is soil shear strength n m 2 recorded by a shear vane humboldt mfg co illinois usa at 15 d before physiological maturity and d is root plate diameter as described above 2 3 3 morphological traits grain yield and yield components at the flowering stage six plants in each plot were harvested and separated into roots stems leaves and heads the leaf area of a sub sample was recorded by multiplying leaf length by the greatest width and multiplying by a correction factor of 0 75 li et al 2016 leaf area index lai was calculated as the ratio of leaf area to ground area aboveground biomass including all plant portions was determined after oven drying at 80 c to constant weight the root soil ball with a soil surface area of approximately 360 cm2 and to a depth of 30

oven drying at 80 c to constant weight at physiological maturity 30 plants in the center of each plot were harvested the heads were separated and then sun dried for several days to determine grain yield per unit area based on a standard moisture content of 0 12 g h2o g 1 fresh weight meanwhile six plants were sampled to determine yield components aboveground biomass and harvest index hi the plants were separated into stems leaves and heads the achene was separated from the head and the unfilled achene was removed thousand achene weight and total achene weight was then determined the ovary walls of achenes were removed by hand and then the seed number per head and seed weight were determined head diameter was recorded by a ruler aboveground biomass consisting of all plant sections was determined after oven drying at 80 c to constant weight harvest index was calculated as the total achene weight divided by the aboveground biomass 2 4 data analysis two way analysis of variance

treatment means were compared at p 0 05 using fisher s least significant difference lsd0 05 test data of each year are shown separately because year and its interactions with irrigation regime and n application rate showed a significant effect for most parameters table 1 pearson s correlation coefficient was used to evaluate linear associations among ss sf kτd3 grain yield and morphological and mechanical parameters using the corr procedure of sas 3 results 3 1 soil moisture soil moisture was only compared between the two irrigation regimes averaged across n treatments because n did not show significant effect on soil moisture the dynamic changes in soil moisture between si and rf across n treatments in both years are shown in fig 3 the si treatment exhibited higher svwc than that of the rf treatment during both growing seasons although both treatments had similar dynamic changes over time the svwc was 13 4 and 19 1 higher under si compared to rf conditions in 2018 and 2019 respectively when averaged across the whole measured period gravimetric water content to a soil depth of 200 cm at sowing and maturity in both years is shown in fig 4 at maturity gravimetric water content under si was consistently higher than that under rf conditions regardless of soil depth p 0 05 soil gravimetric water content under si when averaged across various soil depths was increased by 9 5 and 15 8 respectively in 2018 and 2019 in comparison with the rf treatment p 0 05 the et was 19 3 and 13 7 higher under si than rf conditions in 2018 and 2019 respectively p 0 05 nitrogen treatment did not have a significant effect on et under the two irrigation regimes in both years 3 2 grain yield yield components and water use efficiency sprinkler irrigation increased grain yield of sunflower by 11 3 and 12 6 in 2018 and 2019 respectively compared to rf conditions when averaged across n treatments p 0 05 table 2 similarly its yield components including achene weight and seed weight were higher under si compared to rf conditions in 2018 p 0 05 in 2019 seed weight was higher under si than the rf treatment although the difference was not statistically significant there were no significant differences in seed number per head head diameter hi aboveground biomass and wue between the si and rf treatments in either year nitrogen treatment significantly influenced grain yield yield components and wue the interactions among n rates irrigation regimes and years did not show a significant effect on these parameters table 1 grain yield achene weight seed weight hi aboveground biomass and wue were higher under the increasing n rates irrespective of si and rf treatments in both years p 0 05 table 2 the lowest yield consistently occurred under zero n application for both si and rf treatments the highest yield was achieved under si treatment with a n application rate of 240 kg n ha 1 in 2018 and 180 kg n ha 1 in 2019 which was 68 5 and 29 3 higher compared to the rf treatment with no n applied in 2018 and 2019 respectively grain yield achene weight and seed weight were not significantly different between n rates of 180 and 240 kg n ha 1 under both si and rf treatments seed number per head aboveground biomass and wue were reduced in most cases when the n rate increased from 180 to 240 kg n ha 1 3 3 morphological parameters lodging related traits and their relationships the four important lodging related parameters including mr sr sf and kτd3 are shown in figs 5 and 6 other morphological parameters and lodging related traits are illustrated in table 3 sprinkler irrigation decreased kτd3 by 10 0 and 8 6 p 0 05 and increased mr by 6 0 and 4 3 in 2018 and 2019 respectively compared with rf when averaged across all n treatments sprinkler irrigation did not show a consistent effect on sr and sf across both years and increased stem diameter and hr by 11 0 and 6 8 in 2018 respectively and aboveground biomass at flowering by 24 7 in 2019 p 0 05 irrigation regime did not show a consistent and significant effect on root biomass fresh weight and root plate diameter in both years despite lai and fresh weight being significantly higher under si compared to rf conditions in 2019 when averaged across n treatments nitrogen treatment significantly affected mr sr sf and kτd3 regardless of irrigation regime although its interactions with irrigation regimes and years had not a significant effect on these traits table 1 mr increased with an increase in n rate under the si and rf treatments in both years p 0 05 conversely sr sf and kτd3 decreased with higher n rate under the si and rf treatments in both years p 0 05 leaf area index aboveground biomass at flowering plant height stem diameter hr and fresh weight at maturity increased with increasing n rate while root biomass and root plate diameter at maturity decreased with increasing n rate regardless of irrigation regime p 0 05 all morphological parameters and lodging related traits did not show significant difference between 180 and 240 kg n ha 1 under both si and rf treatments despite root plate diameter being greater under 180 kg n ha 1 than 240 kg n ha 1 p 0 05 correlations between all morphological parameters lodging related traits grain yield yield components and wue are presented in table 4 anchorage strength was positively related to sf kτd3 and root

0 05 4 discussion 4 1 yield and wue under si and n fertilizer management overall si exhibited 12 higher grain yield than rf across both years in this study this yield improvement under si can be mainly attributed to improved soil moisture conditions and higher water availability figs 3 and 4 as svwc at a 20 cm depth and gravimetric water content in the 0 200 cm soil layer were increased by 16 3 and 12 6 respectively when averaged across the whole measured period and two experimental years such favorable water conditions under si can enhance water and nutrient absorption promote root development and thereby improve overall crop growth and final yield which is in agreement with previous reports on other crops darko et al 2017 pinto et al 2020 zou et al 2020 as grain yield of sunflower is determined by yield components such as seed number per head seed weight and achene weight aguirrezábal et al 2003 an increase in achene weight seed weight hi and aboveground biomass was evidenced under si compared to the rf treatment due to favorable water conditions these findings are further supported by strong relationships of grain yield with hi aboveground biomass and yield components table 4 effective n fertilizer management is essential for achieving higher grain yield and n use efficiency for sunflower production zubriski and zimmerman 1974 freire et al 2019 wu et al 2019 this study also found a positive yield response to increasing n application in line with this study the existing literature suggests that higher n application can improve n concentration and accumulation in sunflower which is mostly accompanied by increased aboveground biomass and grain number per unit area zubriski and zimmerman 1974 wu et al 2019 however prominent n response was not observed when n rate increased from 180 to 240 kg n ha 1 in both years this implies that a moderate n rate of 180 kg n ha 1 can fully express yield potential of sunflower an excessive n rate beyond this level may even reduce n use efficiency and net economic return li et al 2019 nevertheless n management could execute a synergistic effect in combination with si this could be because an increase in soil moisture under si promotes n uptake in sunflower while a higher amount of available n further improves water uptake and wue and thereby stimulates crop development even under water deficit conditions wang et al 2018 yang et al 2020 such positive interaction could increase crop yield under si coupled with an appropriate n application rate ultimately leading to maximum yields water use efficiency is an important indicator for evaluating water productivity koech and langat 2018 higher wue can generally be achieved by reducing et and enhancing grain yield li et al 2016 although et was 16 5 higher under si than rf conditions due to additional irrigation water input grain yield was significantly higher under si thus wue under si was comparable with that of rf conditions because of the trade off between et and grain yield in northern china the commonly used irrigation method is flood irrigation in which flow of water is governed by the slope of the field rai et al 2017 koech and langat 2018 this conventional irrigation strategy generally requires approximately 400 mm of water to be applied during a single cropping season and has resulted in a higher et li et al 2016 conversely the present si practice as an efficient pressurized irrigation method that used only 90 mm of irrigated water per season in this study saved a larger amount of irrigation water compared with conventional irrigation strategy which is in agreement with other studies li et al 2016 rai et al 2017 koech and langat 2018 undoubtedly in comparison with rf si could be used as a promising water saving strategy to mitigate drought stress and improve sunflower production 4 2 root lodging resistance under si and n fertilizer management the risk of root lodging increases under high yielding environments when favorable conditions such as excessive n application and adequate water supply are provided berry et al 2004 wu et al 2019 in this study the motivation to promote grain yield by increasing n application rate led to higher risk of root lodging the reason could be that the risk of root lodging in terms of sf increased with higher n rate which was mainly attributed to increased mr and decreased ss which were accompanied by declining kτd3 in line with our findings previous studies have also indicated that greater n rate can increase plant height hr and fresh weight of individual plants and therefore increase mr significantly which was negatively correlated with root lodging resistance sposaro et al 2008 wu and ma 2016 thus the highest n application rate i e 240 kg n ha 1 is inadvisable for sunflower production due to higher lodging risk and no yield advantage over a moderate n application rate as discussed above improved soil moisture under si promoted crop growth and increased hr and fresh weight of individual plants which thereby enhanced mr by 6 0 which was negatively correlated with root lodging resistance van delden et al 2010 however this effect was found to be non significant and failed to cause a major impact on root lodging resistance under si furthermore the ss of si and rf treatments was comparable because of their similar root biomass and root plate diameter near the maturity stage therefore root lodging resistance in terms of sf under si was equivalent to that under rf in both years it can be concluded that the risk of root lodging was not accelerated by si these results provide important information for adaptation of si in dry semi humid regions according to the model of kτd3 developed by crook and ennos 1993 for root anchorage sr could theoretically integrate soil shear strength and root spread diameter this model implies that kτd3 is involved in soil properties characterization such as penetration resistance porosity and soil shear strength that depend on soil water content goodman and ennos 1999 sposaro et al 2008 wu and ma 2016 irrigation water under si can soften the upper soil layer and weaken the soil shear strength thereby reducing the kτd3 as anticipated high soil moisture softened the soil layer under si in comparison with rf conditions and as a result soil shear strength was reduced from 23 0 17 8 kpa which led to a decrease in kτd3 under si compared to the rf treatment higher soil moisture under si also promoted root growth and thereby increased root plate diameter compared to rf conditions which might have positive contribution to kτd3 however the impact of the former was projected to exceed the impact of the latter and therefore kτd3 was significantly higher under rf conditions than si the wetted soil under si led to a negative impact on root anchorage as was hypothesized under si the irrigation water wets the foliage of the crop and thus adds to its self weight and torque ultimately leading to greater lodging susceptibility as this phenomenon was not a focus in this study it deserves further clarification improvement of root lodging resistance through plant breeding is of great importance wu et al 2018 sposaro et al 2008 suggested that root plate diameter is a key trait in making selection for root lodging resistance since sr is a linear function of kτd3 estimation of root plate diameter of hundreds of genotypes is quite easy whereas measurement of ss is relatively complex and time consuming similarly a more reliable way to increase root lodging resistance in breeding programs could be through selection for a larger and more rigid taproot system crook and ennos 1993 wu et al 2018 the strong positive relationships between ss sf and root plate diameter and root biomass were also observed in this study which further validate the value of root plate diameter nevertheless such a robust association between the promising criterion and root lodging resistance is also dependent on genotype soil type stage of crop development and several agronomic practices which need further clarification sposaro et al 2008 piñera chavez et al 2016 4 3 recommendation of si groundwater was the main source of irrigation at the experimental site and many other parts of northwestern china li et al 2016 during the last 10 years or so a 1 35 m yr 1 decline in the water table has been observed in this region due to excessive pumping of ground water that in turn has also counterbalanced the higher water deficit in terms of difference between precipitation and et umair et al 2019 considering this serious shortage of irrigation water with ongoing climate change drought has become the most severe threat to sunflower production koech and langat 2018 wu et al 2018 as a promising option si can optimize and minimize the groundwater use that is required to fully satisfy crop water requirements rodrigues et al 2013 darko et al 2017 while ensuring an improved grain yield and desirable wue as evidenced in this study our findings help to validate the suitability and practicability of si the pressurized irrigation method in combination with appropriate n application rate 180 kg n ha 1 could be widely adopted by local producers due to its greater efficiency and ease of operation 5 conclusions sprinkler irrigation exhibited significantly higher grain yield than rf conditions although wue was not influenced such yield improvement under si can be mainly attributed to better soil moisture conditions that were further supported by strong relationships of grain yield with lai stem diameter plant height achene weight hi and aboveground biomass a positive yield response to increasing n rate from 0 to 180 kg n ha 1 occurred but was not shown when the n rate was increased beyond 180 kg n ha 1 implying that the moderate n rate can fully express yield potential in addition risk of root lodging in terms of sf increased under higher n application rates thus making the highest n rate of 240 kg ha 1 inadvisable because of its greater lodging risk and no yield advantage over the moderate n rate risk of root lodging under si and rf treatments was equivalent because of the trade off between sr and mr although the irrigation water under si weakened the soil shear strength and declined kτd3 it can be further concluded that the risk of root lodging was not accelerated by si practice taken together si in combination with an n application rate of 180 kg n ha 1 could be recommended as a promising management

10564,sunflower helianthus annuus l is an important edible oilseed crop that is frequently exposed to drought stress due to lack and unpredictability of precipitation sprinkler irrigation si is a promising approach for improving yield under limited availability of water but is often associated with increased risk of root lodging the irrigation water can soften the upper soil layer and increase the torque of the aboveground portion of the crop this study aims to evaluate the effect of si and nitrogen n application rate on grain yield water use efficiency wue and root lodging resistance of sunflower the risk of root lodging was evaluated by a safety factor sf indicator the results showed that soil water content was 13 4 and 19 1 higher under si in comparison with rainfed rf conditions in 2018 and 2019 respectively when averaged across the whole measured period sprinkler irrigation exhibited 12 higher mean grain yield than rf conditions across both years p 0 05 although wue was not influenced the yield advantage under si was supported by strong relationships of grain yield with harvest index aboveground biomass and yield components a positive yield response to increasing n rate from 0 to 180 kg n ha 1 was evidenced beyond which no response was observed root lodging resistance in terms of sf increased with higher n application rate due to decrease in anchorage strength root lodging resistance between si and rf treatments was not significantly different due to the trade off between anchorage strength and self weight moment although irrigation water under si weakened the soil shear strength and reduced the anchorage strength estimated by a theoretical model taken together si in combination with an n rate of 180 kg ha 1 could be recommended to mitigate drought stress and improve grain yield and root lodging resistance of sunflower keywords deficit irrigation root lodging water use efficiency nitrogen management 1 introduction improvement of grain yield and oil content of sunflower is required to keep pace with the increasing consumer demand flagella et al 2002 rauf et al 2017 sunflower production is mostly limited by frequent exposure to drought flagella et al 2002 wu et al 2018 the occurrence of drought is unpredictable as it mainly depends on the amount of rainfall and its distribution in rainfed regions worldwide li et al 2016 uncertainties in weather conditions can result in decreasing efficient rainfall coupled with increasing evapotranspiration thus it is imperative to effectively tackle the issue of increasing irrigation water scarcity by optimizing irrigation management that can offset unpredictable and limited precipitation heumesser et al 2012 koech and langat 2018 however local producers tend to use the conventional over irrigation system to maximize yield performance which often leads to large amount of irrigation water consumption and low water use efficiency wue rai et al 2017 ebrahimian et al 2019 the optimization of irrigation management can be achieved through the adoption of sprinkler irrigation si rodrigues et al 2013 the key implication of si is applying irrigation water through showers resembling natural rainfall which facilitates uniform distribution of water over the field soil rodrigues et al 2013 darko et al 2017 rai et al 2017 most studies have indicated that the estimated water consumption under si is almost half of that under surface irrigation rai et al 2017 koech and langat 2018 zou et al 2020 therefore si utilizes less water than that needed to fully satisfy the crop water requirements and thus enhances wue and economic returns rodrigues et al 2013 previous studies have optimized si practices for several crops including zea mays zou et al 2020 oryza sativa pinto et al 2020 gossypium spp wang et al 2018 and triticum aestivum yan et al 2019 however si has not been extensively exploited or applied for sunflower in dry semi humid regions nitrogen n is not only the most important macronutrient for crop growth and development but also plays a key role in determining the final yield performance of sunflower zubriski and zimmerman 1974 freire et al 2019 previous studies have suggested a synergistic association between n and water because higher n application rate can increase crop metabolism and root hydraulic conductance which enhance water availability and the nutritional effectiveness of n and phosphorus simultaneously wu and ma 2015 shah and wu 2019 yang et al 2020 however excessive n fertilization can decrease crop yield n use efficiency and economic return and increase greenhouse gas emissions wu et al 2019 therefore appropriate n fertilizer management could be combined with irrigation management synergistically to improve n use efficiency wue and grain yield with minimal environmental risk wang et al 2018 freire et al 2019 yan et al 2019 crop lodging is a common problem and the main constraint in improving sunflower yield under favorable weather conditions especially when excessive n and water are applied ennos et al 1993 goodman and ennos 1999 berry et al 2004 lodging suppresses the photosynthetic ability disrupts grain filling reduces achene weight and thereby reduces grain yield and quality pinthus 1973 wu and ma 2016 kendall et al 2017 lodging in sunflower is generally categorized as root lodging and stem lodging both of which have been commonly reported due to failure of the root anchorage system or the tensile failure of the stem sposaro et al 2010 the susceptibility of root and stem lodging depends on complex interactions between the biomechanical and morphological characteristics of the stems and roots and the torque of the aboveground parts of the crops that capture wind and rain sposaro et al 2010 manzur et al 2014 previous studies suggested that population density genotype crop growth stage soil property and agronomic management showed significant effect on these variables and thereby influenced lodging resistance in sunflower sposaro et al 2008 pinthus 1973 root lodging root failure is initiated by failure of the root soil anchorage system and displacement of the root system ennos et al 1993 sposaro et al 2008 under irrigated conditions a large portion of crop lodging could be attributed to root lodging rather than stem lodging stem buckling because of heavy top weight and lack of support due to softened soil in the root zone ennos et al 1993 piñera chavez et al 2016 yang and zheng 2016 nevertheless sposaro et al 2010 and hall et al 2010 reported that stem lodging can be at high risk in well anchored plants when the external force applied to the aboveground part of plants is beyond the stem failure moment both si and n fertilizer management have major impact on the morphological and mechanical parameters of aboveground plant parts structure of the root system and soil properties that are associated with root lodging resistance berry et al 2004 wu et al 2019 however the effects of si n fertilizer and their combination on root lodging resistance and the associated mechanisms in sunflower are unclear although this has been studied partly in other species such as cereal crops pinthus 1973 wu et al 2019 it is hypothesized that si could influence the risk of root lodging via two pathways 1 si could moisten and soften the upper soil layer which in turn reduce the soil shear strength and manipulate root architecture which is detrimental for anchorage of the root system and 2 si could influence crop growth habits and phenotypic traits and thereby change the torque self weight moment of the aboveground part of the crop we also hypothesize that excessive n fertilizer application increases the risk of root lodging because of greater plant height and self weight moment and a decreased root system although the breaking resistance and flexural rigidity could be increased in some cases wu et al 2018 2019 this study aims to 1 determine the effect of si and n application rate on grain yield and wue and clarify whether si could be adopted for sunflower production and 2 unravel the impact of si and n application rate on root lodging resistance and its underlying mechanisms by employing a standardized protocol 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description a field experiment was conducted in 2018 and repeated in an adjacent field in 2019 at the sanyuan experimental station of northwest a f university 34 36 n 108 52 e the experimental site was located in the guanzhong plain of shaanxi province which has a dry semi humid climate before the

at the experimental site were obtained from an automatic weather station fig 1 2 2 experimental design and cultural practices the experiment comprised a factorial arrangement of irrigation regimes n treatments in a split plot design with three replications in both years the main plots consisted of two irrigation regimes including rainfed rf conditions and si for the si treatment the relevant details of the irrigation system installed by huawei water saving technology group co ltd shanghai china are provided in fig 2 the lateral pipes with emitters spaced 20 cm apart were positioned in the same direction as the row of sunflower the flow of water driven by a pressurized water pump into the si plots began at approximately 09 00 h every 10 d and continued for 30 min with a total flow rate of about 10 mm wu and ma 2016 each plot designated to si treatment was irrigated nine times during both years and the accumulated irrigation water was 95 and 90 mm in 2018 and 2019 respectively no supplemental irrigation was applied in the rf plots the subplots consisted of four n rates 0 120 180 and 240 kg n ha 1 nitrogen fertilizer as urea 46 n was split applied at 0 20 and 40 d after sowing das with a splitting pattern of 50 30 20 the basal n fertilizer was broadcasted on the soil surface and was incorporated into the soil within one day after application the remaining n fertilizer was top dressed according to the abovementioned schedule by hand while executing si phosphorus at 40 kg p2o5 ha 1 and potassium at 50 kg k ha 1 were applied as basal fertilizer in all plots using calcium superphosphate and potassium chloride respectively the widely adopted commercial sunflower hybrid chicy102 was used in both years the seed was sown on 14 june 2018 and 13 may 2019 and harvested on 13 september 2018 and 14 august 2018 the row to row and plant to plant spacing was 60 40 cm in 2018 and 60 35 cm in 2019 all subplots had an area of 24 0 m2 6 m long and 4 m wide other agronomic practices followed standard procedures suited to this region 2 3 measurements and calculations 2 3 1 soil moisture and water use efficiency soil volumetric water content svwc at the 20 cm soil depth was measured at 1 h intervals automatically by a hobo data station h21 002 onset computer corporation bourne ma usa that was connected to a soil moisture sensor smc m005 onset computer corporation bourne ma usa before sowing and after harvesting soil samples were taken at 20 cm increments to a depth of 200 cm from all plots using an auger then gravimetric water content was determined by drying the soil at 105 c to a constant weight the average soil bulk densities were 1 05 1 27 11 8 and 13 6 g cm 3 for the 0 20 20 80 80 160 and 160 200 cm soil layers respectively li et al 2016 total soil water storage sws in the 0 200 cm depth was calculated as follows 1 s w s i 1 n ρ i θ i h i where n is the number of soil layers ρi g cm 3 is soil bulk density that was previously reported by li et al 2016 θi g g 1 is gravimetric water content and hi mm is thickness of the ith soil layer evapotranspiration et for the entire sunflower growing season was determined as follows 2 e t p s w d i d r where p mm is total precipitation during the crop growing season swd soil water depletion mm is the difference in sws of the 0 200 cm soil layer between harvesting and sowing i mm is the total irrigation amount d is the amount of water that percolated deeply and r is surface runoff both d and r were considered to be negligible in this experiment as the field had loamy clay soil with high field capacity 26 and the groundwater table was 20 m below the soil surface li et al 2016 the wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated as grain yield kg ha 1 divided by et mm 2 3 2 measurements and calculations for root lodging the lodging related traits were recorded in each plot at 15 d before physiological maturity in both years firstly five representative plants were tagged and cut off at 50 cm above the ground level a simulated root lodging test was performed on the remaining stem base of each plant according to wu and ma 2018 using a custom made lodging meter originated from a mecmesin digital force gauge mecmesin slinfold uk the restoring anchorage strength sr supplied by the total root system was recorded when the basal stem was pushed at a rotation speed of 2 0 s 1 to a 30 angle from its vertical position the basal stem was then cut at the ground level and combined with its corresponding aboveground plant part as a whole the whole plant was then balanced on a thin metal tube and the distance between the balance point and the base end was recorded as the height of the center of gravity hr plant height was measured as the distance between the soil surface and the top of the plant fresh weight of the total plant mr was recorded immediately after harvesting the stem diameter at the basal position of the stem was measured by a digital caliper after the simulated root lodging test the root soil ball was carefully extracted by a spade and root plate diameter was recorded according to the method described by wu and ma 2016 safety factor for root lodging sf was calculated as 3 sf sr mr where sr is root anchorage strength nm as described by wu and ma 2018 parameter mr is the self weight moment nm at θo from the vertical which was calculated as 4 mr sinθ hr mr g where θ is the inclination angle from the vertical stand hr is the height of the center of gravity cm mr is fresh weight g and g is the acceleration due to gravity n kg 1 the higher the value of sf the greater the root lodging resistance of the tested plants was this sf method can be applied to evaluate susceptibility of root lodging of most self supporting crops ennos et al 1993 wu and ma 2018 root lodging instead of stem lodging was considered in the present study mainly because root lodging is more prevalent than stem buckling in sunflower under irrigated conditions ennos et al 1993 sposaro et al 2008 a theoretical model was also used to estimate the anchorage strength crook and ennos 1993 by integrating the soil shear strength and root plate diameter as 5 sr kτd3 where k is a dimensionless constant τ is soil shear strength n m 2 recorded by a shear vane humboldt mfg co illinois usa at 15 d before physiological maturity and d is root plate diameter as described above 2 3 3 morphological traits grain yield and yield components at the flowering stage six plants in each plot were harvested and separated into roots stems leaves and heads the leaf area of a sub sample was recorded by multiplying leaf length by the greatest width and multiplying by a correction factor of 0 75 li et al 2016 leaf area index lai was calculated as the ratio of leaf area to ground area aboveground biomass including all plant portions was determined after oven drying at 80 c to constant weight the root soil ball with a soil surface area of approximately 360 cm2 and to a depth of 30 cm was carefully excavated by a spade the root soil balls were immersed in tap water for at least 1 h and then washed thoroughly wu and ma 2016 the dry weight of roots of each plant was recorded after oven drying at 80 c to constant weight at physiological maturity 30 plants in the center of each plot were harvested the heads were separated and then sun dried for several days to determine grain yield per unit area based on a standard moisture content of 0 12 g h2o g 1 fresh weight meanwhile six plants were sampled to determine yield components aboveground biomass and harvest index hi the plants were separated into stems leaves and heads the achene was separated from the head and the unfilled achene was removed thousand achene weight and total achene weight was then determined the ovary walls of achenes were removed by hand and then the seed number per head and seed weight were determined head diameter was recorded by a ruler aboveground biomass consisting of all plant sections was determined after oven drying at 80 c to constant weight harvest index was calculated as the total achene weight divided by the aboveground biomass 2 4 data analysis two way analysis of variance was conducted to assess treatment effects including irrigation regime and n application rate in each year sas institute 2003 once a significant p 0 05 effect was determined by analysis of variance treatment means were compared at p 0 05 using fisher s least significant difference lsd0 05 test data of each year are shown separately because year and its interactions with irrigation regime and n application rate showed a significant effect for most parameters table 1 pearson s correlation coefficient was used to evaluate linear associations among ss sf kτd3 grain yield and morphological and mechanical parameters using the corr procedure of sas 3 results 3 1 soil moisture soil moisture was only compared between the two irrigation regimes averaged across n treatments because n did not show significant effect on soil moisture the dynamic changes in soil moisture between si and rf across n treatments in both years are shown in fig 3 the si treatment exhibited higher svwc than that of the rf treatment during both growing seasons although both treatments had similar dynamic changes over time the svwc was 13 4 and 19 1 higher under si compared to rf conditions in 2018 and 2019 respectively when averaged across the whole measured period gravimetric water content to a soil depth of 200 cm at sowing and maturity in both years is shown in fig 4 at maturity gravimetric water

treatment did not have a significant effect on et under the two irrigation regimes in both years 3 2 grain yield yield components and water use efficiency sprinkler irrigation increased grain yield of sunflower by 11 3 and 12 6 in 2018 and 2019 respectively compared to rf conditions when averaged across n treatments p 0 05 table 2 similarly its yield components including achene weight and seed weight were higher under si compared to rf conditions in 2018 p 0 05 in 2019 seed weight was higher under si than the rf treatment although the difference was not statistically significant there were no significant differences in seed number per head head diameter hi aboveground biomass and wue between the si and rf treatments in either year nitrogen treatment significantly influenced grain yield

biomass and wue were higher under the increasing n rates irrespective of si and rf treatments in both years p 0 05 table 2 the lowest yield consistently occurred under zero n application for both si and rf treatments the highest yield was achieved under si treatment with a n application rate of 240 kg n ha 1 in 2018 and 180 kg n ha 1 in 2019 which was 68 5 and 29 3 higher compared to the rf treatment with no n applied in 2018 and 2019 respectively grain yield achene weight and seed weight were not significantly different between n rates of 180 and 240 kg n ha 1 under both si and rf treatments seed number per head aboveground biomass and wue were reduced in most cases when the n rate increased from 180 to 240 kg n ha 1 3 3 morphological parameters lodging related traits and their relationships the four important lodging related parameters including mr sr sf and kτd3 are shown in figs 5 and 6 other morphological parameters and lodging related traits are illustrated in table 3 sprinkler irrigation decreased kτd3 by 10 0 and 8 6 p 0 05 and increased mr by 6 0 and 4 3 in 2018 and 2019 respectively compared with rf when averaged across all n treatments sprinkler irrigation did

irrigation regime did not show a consistent and significant effect on root biomass fresh weight and root plate diameter in both years despite lai and fresh weight being significantly higher under si compared to rf conditions in 2019 when averaged across n treatments nitrogen treatment significantly affected mr sr sf and kτd3 regardless of irrigation regime although its interactions with irrigation regimes and years had not a significant effect on these traits table 1 mr increased with an increase in n rate under the si and rf treatments in both years p 0 05 conversely sr sf and kτd3 decreased with higher n rate under the si and rf treatments in both years p 0 05 leaf area index aboveground biomass at flowering plant height stem diameter hr and fresh weight at maturity increased with increasing n rate while root biomass and root plate diameter at maturity decreased with increasing n rate regardless of irrigation regime p 0 05 all morphological parameters and lodging related traits did not show significant difference between 180 and 240 kg n ha 1 under both si and rf treatments despite root plate diameter being greater under 180 kg n ha 1 than 240 kg n ha 1 p 0 05 correlations between all morphological parameters lodging related traits grain yield yield components and wue are presented in table 4 anchorage strength was positively related to sf kτd3 and root

0 05 4 discussion 4 1 yield and wue under si and n fertilizer management overall si exhibited 12 higher grain yield than rf across both years in this study this yield improvement under si can be mainly attributed to improved soil moisture conditions and higher water availability figs 3 and 4 as svwc at a 20 cm depth and gravimetric water content in the 0 200 cm soil layer were increased by 16 3 and 12 6 respectively when averaged across the whole measured period and two experimental years such favorable water conditions under si can enhance water and nutrient absorption promote root development and thereby improve overall crop growth and final yield which is in agreement with previous reports on other crops darko et al 2017 pinto et al 2020 zou et al 2020 as grain yield of sunflower is determined by yield components such as seed number per head seed weight and achene weight aguirrezábal et al 2003 an increase in achene weight seed weight hi and aboveground biomass was evidenced under si compared to the rf treatment due to favorable water conditions these findings are further supported by strong relationships of grain yield with hi aboveground biomass and yield components table 4 effective n fertilizer management is essential for achieving higher grain yield and n use efficiency for sunflower production zubriski and zimmerman 1974 freire et al 2019 wu et al 2019 this study also found a positive yield response to increasing n application in line with this study the existing literature suggests that higher n application can improve n concentration and accumulation in sunflower which is mostly accompanied by increased aboveground biomass and grain number per unit area zubriski and zimmerman 1974 wu et al 2019 however prominent n response was not observed when n rate increased from 180 to 240 kg n ha 1 in both years this implies that a moderate n rate of 180 kg n ha 1 can fully express yield potential of sunflower an excessive n rate beyond this level may even reduce n use efficiency and net economic return li et al 2019 nevertheless n management could execute a synergistic effect in combination with si this could be because an increase in soil moisture under si promotes n uptake in sunflower while a higher amount of available n further improves water uptake and wue and thereby stimulates crop development even under water deficit conditions wang et al 2018 yang et al 2020 such positive interaction could increase crop yield under si coupled with an appropriate n application rate ultimately leading to maximum yields water use efficiency is an important indicator for evaluating water productivity koech and langat 2018 higher wue can generally be achieved by reducing et and enhancing grain yield li et al 2016 although et was 16 5 higher under si than rf conditions due to additional irrigation water input grain yield was significantly higher under si thus wue under si was comparable with that of rf conditions because of the trade off between et and grain yield in northern china the commonly used irrigation method is flood irrigation in which flow of water is governed by the slope of the field rai et al 2017 koech and langat 2018 this conventional irrigation strategy generally requires approximately 400 mm of water to be applied during a single cropping season and has resulted in a higher et li et al 2016 conversely the present si practice as an efficient pressurized irrigation method that used only 90 mm of irrigated water per season in this study saved a larger amount of irrigation water compared with conventional irrigation strategy which is in agreement with other studies li et al 2016 rai et al 2017 koech and langat 2018 undoubtedly in comparison with rf si could be used as a promising water saving strategy to mitigate drought stress and improve sunflower production 4 2 root lodging resistance under si and n fertilizer management the risk of root lodging increases under high yielding environments when favorable conditions such as excessive n application and adequate water supply are provided berry et al 2004 wu et al 2019 in this study the motivation to promote grain yield by increasing n application rate led to higher risk of root lodging the reason could be that the risk of root lodging in terms of sf increased with higher n rate which was mainly attributed to increased mr and decreased ss which were accompanied by declining kτd3 in line with our findings previous studies have also indicated that greater n rate can increase plant height hr and fresh weight of individual plants and therefore increase mr significantly which was negatively correlated with root lodging resistance sposaro et al 2008 wu and ma 2016 thus the highest n application rate i e 240 kg n ha 1 is inadvisable for sunflower production due to higher lodging risk and no yield advantage over a moderate n application rate as discussed above improved soil moisture under si promoted crop growth and increased hr and fresh weight of individual plants which thereby enhanced mr by 6 0 which was negatively correlated with root lodging resistance van delden et al 2010 however this effect was found to be non significant and failed to cause a major impact on root lodging resistance under si furthermore the ss of si and rf treatments was comparable because of their similar root biomass and root plate diameter near the maturity stage therefore root lodging resistance in terms of sf under si was equivalent to that under rf in both years it can be concluded that the risk of root lodging was not accelerated by si these results provide important information for adaptation of si in dry semi humid regions according to the model of kτd3 developed by crook and ennos 1993 for root anchorage sr could theoretically integrate soil shear strength and root spread diameter this model implies that kτd3 is involved in soil properties characterization such as penetration resistance porosity and soil shear strength that depend on soil water content goodman and ennos 1999 sposaro et al 2008 wu and ma 2016 irrigation water under si can soften the upper soil layer and weaken the soil shear strength thereby reducing the kτd3 as anticipated high soil moisture softened the soil layer under si in comparison with rf conditions and as a result soil shear strength was reduced from 23 0 17 8 kpa which led to a decrease in kτd3 under si compared to the rf treatment higher soil moisture under si also promoted root growth and thereby increased root plate diameter compared to rf conditions which might have positive contribution to kτd3 however the impact of the former was projected to exceed the impact of the latter and therefore kτd3 was significantly higher under rf conditions than si the wetted soil under si led to a negative impact on root anchorage as was hypothesized under si the irrigation water wets the foliage of the crop and thus adds to its self weight and torque ultimately leading to greater lodging susceptibility as this phenomenon was not a focus in this study it deserves further clarification improvement of root lodging resistance through plant breeding is of great importance wu et al 2018 sposaro et al 2008 suggested that root plate diameter is a key trait in making selection for root lodging resistance since sr is a linear function of kτd3 estimation of root plate diameter of hundreds of genotypes is quite easy whereas measurement of ss is relatively complex and time consuming similarly a more reliable way to increase root lodging resistance in breeding programs could be through selection for a larger and more rigid taproot system crook and ennos 1993 wu et al 2018 the strong positive relationships between ss sf and root plate diameter and root biomass were also observed in this study which further validate the value of root plate diameter nevertheless such a robust association between the promising criterion and root lodging resistance is also dependent on genotype soil type stage of crop development and several agronomic practices which need further clarification sposaro et al 2008 piñera chavez et al 2016 4 3 recommendation of si groundwater was the main source of irrigation at the experimental site and many other parts of northwestern china li et al 2016 during the last 10 years or so a 1 35 m yr 1 decline in the water table has been observed in this region due to excessive pumping of ground water that in turn has also counterbalanced the higher water deficit in terms of difference between precipitation and et umair et al 2019 considering this serious shortage of irrigation water with ongoing climate change drought has become the most severe threat to sunflower production koech and langat 2018 wu et al 2018 as a promising option si can optimize and minimize the groundwater use that is required to fully satisfy crop water requirements rodrigues et al 2013 darko et al 2017 while ensuring an improved grain yield and desirable wue as evidenced in this study our findings help to validate the suitability and practicability of si the pressurized irrigation method in combination with appropriate n application rate 180 kg n ha 1 could be widely adopted by local producers due to its greater efficiency and ease of operation 5 conclusions sprinkler irrigation exhibited significantly higher grain yield than rf conditions although wue was not influenced such yield improvement under si can be mainly attributed to better soil moisture conditions that were further supported by strong relationships of grain yield with lai stem diameter plant height achene weight hi and aboveground biomass a positive yield response to increasing n rate from 0 to 180 kg n ha 1 occurred but was not shown when the n rate was increased beyond 180 kg n ha 1 implying that the moderate n rate can fully express yield potential in addition risk of root lodging in terms of sf increased under higher n application rates thus making the highest n rate of 240 kg ha 1 inadvisable because of its greater lodging risk and no yield advantage over the moderate n rate risk of root lodging under si and rf treatments was equivalent because of the trade off between sr and mr although the irrigation water under si weakened the soil shear strength and declined kτd3 it can be further concluded that the risk of root lodging was not accelerated by si practice taken together si in combination with an n application rate of 180 kg n ha 1 could be recommended as a promising management strategy that not only mitigates drought stress but also improves root lodging resistance of sunflower declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
