20940,a 6 degrees of freedom dof maneuvering and seakeeping unified model is developed and validated for the accurate simulation of wave induced motions of a turning ship s175 in regular and long crest irregular waves in the model a 3dof surge sway yaw maneuvering model and a 5dof sway heave roll pitch yaw seakeeping model are coupled weakly based on the unify theory maneuvering and seakeeping time steps are determined to balance between the time efficiency and accuracy numerical simulations of the s175 turning in regular and irregular waves under different wave lengths and directions are performed in regular waves the simulated turning trajectory speed and wave induced pitch and roll motions are compared with free running experimental results it is found that the simulation model can capture general trends of motion characteristics while the ship turning in waves considerably good agreements are observed for the ship speed and pitch motion especially for cases with long wave length λ l pp 0 70 while reasonable agreements of the turning trajectory and roll motion can also be observed in irregular waves ship turning motions are simulated under different wave patterns with the same spectrum it is found that spectrums of pitch and roll motions under different wave patterns have large discrepancies keywords ship maneuvering in waves seakeeping motion unify theory

slow varying maneuvering motion is usually studied in calm water neglecting the fast varying 1st order wave effect however wave induced motions and 2nd order mean drift force can be too significant to be neglected while the ship maneuvering in certain waves therefore numerical and experimental studies on ship maneuvering in waves accounting for wave induced motions and 2nd order drifting force are required free running model experiments are conducted to understand the behaviour of ship maneuvering in waves and validate numerical models hirano et al 1980 investigated the turning trajectory of a ro ro ship in regular waves through free running model tests the drifting of the turning trajectory was observed and studied yasukawa 2006 2008 described a free running model experiment of the s175 containership experimental results of turning trajectories in regular irregular waves and zig zag stopping maneuvers in regular waves were presented moreover experimental results of wave induced motions while ship turning were also presented in yasukawa 2006 xu 2015 zhang et al 2017 and zhang and zou 2016 reported free running experimental results of the s175 containership doing turning and zig zag maneuvers in regular waves with various wave lengths and rudder rates drifting of turning trajectories wave induced motions and effect of different rudder rates on turning and zig zag motions were analyzed thoroughly based on experimental results elshiekh 2014 conducted repeated turning and zig zag tests of the onr tumblehome in heading beam and following regular waves with various froude numbers and wave lengths uncertainty analyses were performed complete time histories of wave induced motions and trajectories were presented hasnan et al 2019 conducted repeated turning tests of kvlcc2 and kcs in short crest irregular waves the influence of approach speed on drifting distance and direction was investigated variations of turning trajectories under different wave patterns with the same spectrum were found to be negligible however variations of wave induced motions under different wave patterns were not discussed in the paper due to the high cost of model tests several numerical models for the simulation of ship maneuvering in waves have been developed yasukawa 2006 developed a 4dof surge sway yaw roll mmg based model considering 2nd order mean drift forces in both regular and irregular waves through comparison with experimental results the model was proved to be able to predict the drifting of the turning trajectory with practical accuracy in order to simulate wave induced motions while ship turning yasukawa 2006 further added a 6dof nsm based model for high frequency seakeeping motions into the original 4dof mmg based model forming a model with 10 motion equations the predicted wave induced motions were only compared qualitatively with experimental results the overall tendency of motion amplitude and encounter frequency variations while ship turning was captured through visual inspection sutulo and guedes soares 2006 developed a new maneuvering and seakeeping 6dof model considering nonlinear hydrostatic and froude krylov forces and linear radiation and diffraction forces preliminary simulation results were encouraging as they demonstrating turning trajectories in waves and wave induced motions being in accordance with patterns presented by model experiments recently the unified method also referred as two time scale method which solves the rapidly varying seakeeping motion and slowly varying maneuvering motion separately in two time scales is developed to simulate ship maneuvering in waves skejic and faltinsen 2008 developed a time efficient unified model for ship maneuvering in waves the seakeeping model was estimated using the stf method different methods for mean 2nd order drift loads were used to investigate their applicability on predicting the drifting of turning trajectory in regular waves furthermore skejic and faltinsen 2013 investigated turning motions in long crest irregular waves using this unified model the drifting of the turning trajectory was found to be proportional to the h 1 3 of the irregular wave slow drift 2nd order wave loads based on newman s approximation was considered its effect on the ship turning trajectory seemed to be same as that of the mean 2nd order wave loads and the oscillating time varying part had a negligible effect however this was not the case for ship speed and drift angle wave induced motions were not discussed in their papers seo and kim 2011 investigated ship turning in regular waves and wave induced motions also using the coupled maneuvering and seakeeping model in which wave forces were obtained by the 3d rankine panel method in time domain the predicted turning trajectories showed a fair agreement with experiments however an overall time delay was observed for the predicted wave induced motions zhang et al 2017 and zhang and zou 2016 developed a similar unified model with a different boundary value problem bvp for the wave potential to simulate turning trajectories in regular waves and wave induced motions it was found through qualitative comparison that there were also clear discrepancies between predicted wave induced motions and experimental ones from the literature review it can be found that predicted wave induced motions while ship turning are only validated qualitatively and clear discrepancies with test results can be observed through visual inspection therefore comparing to former studies this paper intends to go one small step further to conduct a more quantitative comparison of wave induced pitch and roll motions while ship turning between numerical simulations and model experiments the numerical model developed is a time efficient weakly coupled 6dof maneuvering and seakeeping unified model proposed by yu et al 2017 which is similar to the model proposed by skejic and faltinsen 2008 in the 5dof seakeeping part like sutulo and guedes soares 2006 froude krylov forces are calculated non linearly while radiation and diffraction forces are calculated linearly using the stf method and irf approach the maneuvering part is a typical 3dof mmg model the maneuvering and seakeeping parts are weakly coupled the seakeeping motion is simulated based on the ship speed and heading provided by the maneuvering part while mean 2nd order drift forces acting on the maneuvering motion are calculated by the seakeeping part both the maneuvering and seakeeping parts are fully validated numerical simulations of turning in regular and long crest irregular waves of the s175 containership are performed using the proposed model simulation results of turning trajectories and wave induced motions in regular waves are compared with experimental results presented in xu 2015 satisfactory agreements are observed in irregular waves turning motions are simulated under different wave patterns with the same spectrum wave induced motions under different wave patterns are investigated 2 dynamic modeling in the 6dof weakly coupled model the maneuvering model is a 3dof mmg model ogawa and kasai 1978 while the seakeeping model is a 5dof sway heave roll pitch yaw weakly nonlinear model based on the impulse response function irf approach cummins 1962 the maneuvering and seakeeping motions are combined under the same coordinate system based on unify theory proposed by skejic and faltinsen 2008 details on the 6dof weakly coupled model are described in this section 2 1 coordinate system in

solved with different time steps using 4th order runge kutta method and then combined together the detailed procedure of the unified model is presented in fig 4 in the unified model the slow varying maneuvering motion is simulated using a larger time step comparing to the fast varying seakeeping motion within each time step of maneuvering the seakeeping motion is simulated by several time steps under a constant condition i e the ship speed wave angle χ and ship position which are related to the maneuvering motion are kept constant in this paper the time step of the maneuvering model δt is set as 2 s and the seakeeping time step δt is set as 0 1 s then the total motion under the horizontal body axes o xhyhzh is calculated by combining the two motions together 19 ν t ν s ν m u t v t w t

where the subscript t indicates the total motion based on the total motion including ship total speed and wave encounter angle new irfs and mean drift forces are calculated and used in the calculation of seakeeping and maneuvering motions in the next time step in the model seakeeping and maneuvering models are still simulated separately under their own assumption the coupling between the two models is simply through the total motion obtain by the linear superposition thus the 6dof model based on the unify theory is considered to be a weakly coupled model moreover the model is time efficient because no time consuming calculations such as 3d bvp and cfd calculation are included in the model 3 model validation 3 1 ship specification the subject ship used for model validation is the s175 containership which has been widely used as the benchmark for ship maneuvering in waves the designed main particulars of the ship propeller rudder as well as model scale factor 57 686 are presented in table 1 model experiments of s175 maneuvering in waves are carried out in the ocean engineering model basin of shanghai jiao tong university xu 2015 zhang and zou 2016 all the other data needed for simulation including the hydrodynamic derivatives rudder and propeller factors can be found in the yasukawa 2006 the empirical formula in eqs 7 and 9 are not used since coefficients in these formula have been provided by yasukawa 2006 the sway and yaw artificial natural periods t 2 and t 6 are set as 80s and 100s 3 2 validation of the seakeeping model in order to validate the 5dof seakeeping model motion raos in different ship speed wave frequencies are calculated in the time domain using the 5dof model results in the time domain are transferred into the frequency domain using the fourier transform ft and compared with results obtained in the frequency domain using the stf method comparison results are presented in fig 5 from the figure it can be found that the motion raos calculated in the time domain square dots agree very well with those obtained by the stf method in the frequency domain thin lines moreover calculated heave and pitch raos under heading waves with fn 0 25 and roll raos under beam waves with fn 0 are compared with experimental results diamond and square dots presented by fonseca and guedes soares 2004 and xu 2015 as shown in figs 6 and 7 mean drift force coefficients c xwd c ywd c nwd are calculated and compared with experimental results in fig 8 it can be found that there is no large difference between experimental and simulation results thus the seakeeping part of the proposed 6dof model is validated 3 3 validation of the maneuvering model the 3dof maneuvering model is validated by comparing simulated 35 turning trajectories in calm water with experimental results provided by xu 2015 comparison results are shown in fig 9 in the figure simulated 35 turning trajectories are plotted in black solid and dashed lines while experimental 35 turning trajectories is plotted in red square and round dots it can be observed that simulated trajectories agree quite well with experimental ones especially for the 35 turning advance and tactical diameters between simulations and experiments have very few differences comparison results show good agreements between simulations and experiments thus the maneuvering part of the proposed 6dof model is validated moreover in fig 10 the steady heel generated when ship turning in calm water is simulated using the 6dof model and compared with experimental result presented in xu 2015 under the real ship scale from the figure it is found that the simulated black solid line and measured red dotted line steady heels are almost the same which is around 0 8 moreover it can be observed from both simulated and measured heel angles that the ship heels inward immediately due to the rudder roll moment and then outward due to centrifugal force z h y h 4 results and disscussions in this section the proposed time efficient weakly coupled 6dof maneuvering and seakeeping unified simulation model is applied to simulate maneuvering in regular and long crest irregular waves of the s175 containership simulation results are compared with experimental ones 4 1 experiment setup and cases free running model experiments of s175 maneuveing in waves are carried out in the ocean engineering model basin of shanghai jiao tong university xu 2015 which is 50m long 30m wide and 6m deep the self propelled model ship shown in fig 11 is made by frp and equipped with rudder and propeller the model scale factor is 57 686 the model is driven by a dc motor and steered by a steering motor with autopilot system during the experiment shown in fig 12 the model ship maneuvers in the wave generated by the flap type wave maker under commanded rudder and propeller actions meanwhile pitch roll and yaw angles of the model ship are measured by onboard gyroscopes the trajectory and ship speed are measured by the ccd camera positioning system rudder angle and propeller rate are also measured all the measured data are transmitted to the onshore computer wirelessly more details on the experiment can be found in xu 2015 in table 2 measured parameters of the model ship which are different from parameters of the designed ship in table 1 are presented during the experiment test cases in regular waves with different wave lengths and initial wave directions are selected as shown in table 3 the designed initial froude number of the ship is set as 0 15 which is 0 818 m s in model scale however due to the limited tank length the ship cannot reach the designed initial speed while turning the actual measured initial speed as shown in table 3 is less than the designed one during the simulation the actual measured initial speed is used in order to get a better agreement with experiment results moreover it needs to be mentioned that some irrational long period variations in the measured pitch angle data are observed as shown in figure 13 unfiltered data this is caused by the interference on the zero drift of the gyro sensor therefore these irrational long period variations are filtered using the 7th order highpass butterworth filter while analysing in fig 13 the red dash dot line is the unfiltered data while the black solid line is the filtered data 4 2 results of ship turning in regular waves in this section the proposed weakly coupled 6dof model is applied to simulate the s175 turning in regular waves under cases presented in table 3 simulation results are compared with experimental results under the real ship scale during the simulation the actual measured initial speed is used results of all 10 cases are plotted in figs 14 23 in each figure lines and markers in red color represent experimental results while lines and markers in black color are simulation results there are 5 graphs in each figure the top left graph is the turning trajectory while the top right graph represents the ship speed the second graph shows the heading angle dotted line and the rudder angle solid line the third and fourth graphs are roll and pitch angle respectively firstly general phenomena of ship turning in regular waves are observed and analyzed for experimental results shown in red lines and markers from experimental results it is found that the turning trajectory tends to drift downstream due to the mean drift force because mean drift forces of sway and yaw shown in fig 8 are large when λ l pp less than 1 00 the drifting of the turning trajectory in both heading and beam waves is more significant when λ l pp 0 50 and 0 70 comparing to λ l pp 1 00 1 20 and 1 40 the speed loss can be also observed while ship turning in waves moreover it can be found that amplitudes and frequencies of wave induced roll and pitch motions change with the wave encounter angle η and encounter frequency ω e take fig 16 as an example when t 100s the ship is mainly sailing in the heading wave thus the roll amplitude is small and the pitch amplitude and frequency are high owing to the high encounter frequency in the heading wave around t 150s the wave encounter angle is about 90 and the ship is sailing in beam wave therefore the roll amplitude grows large and the pitch amplitude becomes small when 150s t 400s the ship is turning from beam wave to following wave and back to beam wave the pitch frequency becomes low due to the decreasing of the encounter frequency as ship turning the wave encounter angle and frequency change among head wave beam wave and following wave repeatedly which leads to the changes of amplitudes and frequencies of wave induced roll and pitch motions as described above then comparisons between simulations and experiments are analyzed from the comparison it is found that the simulation model can capture the typical phenomena while ship turning in waves including drifting of turning trajectories and variations on amplitudes and frequencies of wave induced motions in general simulation results are in good agreement with experimental results although it is very difficult to yield a universal agreement for all cases using the proposed weakly coupled model some comparison results are quite encouraging with surprisingly good agreements especially for the ship speed heading and pitch angle for turning trajectories the advance diameter and the trend of drifting show fair agreements except for case no 7 for case no 7 with λ l pp 0 70 the large discrepancies on turning trajectories is probably caused by the neglecting of drift force due to short wave reflection in the proposed model for ship speeds and headings agreements between simulations and experiments are very good in both speed loss and variation for wave induced pitch motions simulation results are almost identical with experimental results not only in variations of amplitudes but also in changes of frequencies especially for cases with long wave length λ l pp 0 70 comparing to the pitch motion simulated roll motions have larger discrepancies with experiment roll motions this is probably because the roll viscous damping is obtained from calm water free roll decay tests under zero speed which is not accurate enough for cases with non zero speed and changing encounter frequencies generally speaking according to the comparison results the proposed time efficient and weakly coupled 6dof simulation model shows very good potential in the accurate prediction of ship maneuvering in waves 4 3 results of ship turning in irregular waves in this section the ship turning in long crest irregular waves is investigated based on simulation results during the simulation the irregular wave spectrum is ittc spectrum 21 s α ω 173 h 1 3 2 t 1 4 ω 5 exp 691 t 1 4 ω 4 where h 1 3 is the significant wave height and t 1 is the wave period three cases with different h 1 3 and t 1 are chosen as presented in table 4 in each irregular wave case the simulation is repeated for 5 times with different wave patterns generated using different sets of random phase θ i under the same spectrum simulation results in irregular waves are plotted in figs 24 26 phenomena similar as regular waves such as drifting of turning trajectories and variations of wave induced motions can be observed the downstream drifting of turning trajectory becomes larger as h 1 3 grows although variations of amplitudes and frequencies are essential for motions in irregular waves it can still be observed that the roll amplitude dies out in heading waves and the pitch amplitude dies out in beam waves which are typical phenomena of ship turning in waves moreover time histories and spectrums obtained by froude transform ft of wave induced motions in repeated tests under different wave patterns are analyzed and plotted in figs 27 29 from motion time histories in figures it is further confirmed that the roll amplitude dies out in heading waves and the pitch amplitude dies out in beam waves this strong phenomenon appears in all different wave patterns and cases from motion spectrum results it is obvious that roll and pitch spectrums under different wave patterns with the same case are completely different in the roll spectrum there is a clear peak which is around the roll natural frequency however there is no clear peak in the pitch spectrum the pitch spectrum seems to be evenly distributed over the main frequency range of the incident wave 4 4 discussions on the simulation model during the simulation the time step of the maneuvering model δt is set as 2 s and the seakeeping time step δt is set as 0 1 s this configuration is determined by evaluating the balance between the time efficiency and accuracy of the model to demonstrate the influence of time steps δt and δt on the time efficiency and accuracy of the model different sets of δt and δt are chosen as shown in table 5 because the most time consuming part of the simulation model is the calculation of new irfs and mean drift forces in the beginning of each maneuvering iteration using the stf method with new ship speed u and wave encounter angle η therefore the less number of maneuvering iterations the less calculation time in sets no 1 2 and 3 the maneuvering time step δt is set as 1s 2s and 3s corresponding to 1200 600 and 400 times of maneuvering iterations with a total simulation time of 1200s moreover in set no 4 the time consuming calculation of new irfs and mean drift forces is conducted only when δu 0 2 m s or δη 3 not in each maneuvering iteration the simulation program runs on single core of the cpu i9 9900k 3 6 4 8 ghz while four core parallel computing is applied only on the part of pressure integration over instantaneous wetted surfaces for nonlinear restoring and f k forces the total calculation time and simulation results of all these sets are presented in table 5 and figs 30 and 31 from table 5 it is obvious that the calculation time is nearly proportional to the number of maneuvering iterations set no 4 is the most time efficient due to least number of time consuming calculation conducted from turning trajectories and wave induced roll and pitch motions shown in figs 30 and 31 it is observed that the wave induced roll and pitch motions of set no 1 2 and 3 are almost the same while turning trajectories are slightly different due to the numerical error caused by large time step the turning trajectory is more accurate with smaller maneuvering time step however smaller maneuvering time step causes longer calculation time such as set no 3 it can be observed from fig 30 that the turning trajectory of set no 2 is very close to set no 3 with only half of the calculation time therefore set no 2 is chosen during the simulation because it yields a balance between the time efficiency and accuracy although there are some discrepancies between simulation results of set no 4 and set no 2 these discrepancies are not significant and are practically acceptable given the considerable short calculation time of set no 4 it is highly suitable for the scenario where calculation time is the major concern 5 conclusions a 6dof weakly coupled maneuvering and seakeeping unified time domain simulation model is proposed for the simulation of ship turning in waves in the model a 3dof surge sway yaw maneuvering model and a 5dof sway heave roll pitch yaw seakeeping model are coupled weakly based on the unify theory the maneuvering and seakeeping parts of the time domain model are fully validated through comparison with the frequency domain method and experiments the model is applied for the simulation of turning tests of the s175 containership in regular and long crest irregular waves through comparisons between simulation and experimental results following conclusions are drawn the model is fully capable of reproducing the drifting of turning circles and the variations on amplitudes and frequencies of the wave induced motion while ship turning in regular and irregular waves although it is very difficult to yield a universal agreement for all cases using the simulation model some comparison results in regular waves are quite encouraging with surprisingly good agreements simulation results of wave induced pitch motion are almost identical with experimental results not only in variations of amplitudes but also in changes of frequencies especially for cases with long wave length λ l pp 0 70 good agreements are also observed for the ship speed for turning trajectories and roll motions simulation results show a satisfactory agreement on overall tendency in irregular waves ship turning motions are simulated under different wave patterns with the same spectrum although variations of amplitudes and frequencies are essential for motions in irregular waves it can still be observed that the roll amplitude dies out in heading waves and the pitch amplitude dies out in beam waves which are typical phenomena of ship turning in waves from motion spectrums obtained by froude transform it is found that spectrums of pitch and roll motions under different wave patterns have large discrepancies through evaluating the balance between the time efficiency and accuracy time steps of maneuvering and seakeeping motion are set as δt 2s δt 0 1s moreover set no 4 in which the time consuming calculation of new irfs and mean drift forces is conducted only when δu 0 2 m s or δη 3 is highly time efficient with practically acceptable accuracy the proposed time efficient and weakly coupled 6dof simulation model shows very good potential in accurate prediction of ship maneuvering in waves in future works the proposed model can be used to simulate ship turning in short crest irregular waves and zig zag motions in waves moreover other than the simulation of maneuvering motions in waves the time efficient model can also be applied to the simulation of ship general 6dof motions in waves credit authorship contribution

slow varying maneuvering motion is usually studied in calm water neglecting the fast varying 1st order wave effect however wave induced motions and 2nd order mean drift force can be too significant to be neglected while the ship maneuvering in certain waves therefore numerical and experimental studies on ship maneuvering in waves accounting for wave induced motions and 2nd order drifting force are required free running model experiments are conducted to understand the behaviour of ship maneuvering in waves and validate numerical models hirano et al 1980 investigated the turning trajectory of a ro ro ship in regular waves through free running model tests the drifting of the turning trajectory was observed and studied yasukawa 2006 2008 described a free running model experiment of the s175 containership experimental results of turning trajectories in regular irregular waves and zig zag stopping maneuvers in regular waves were presented moreover experimental results of wave induced motions while ship turning were also presented in yasukawa 2006 xu 2015 zhang et al 2017 and zhang and zou 2016 reported free running experimental results of the s175 containership doing turning and zig zag maneuvers in regular waves with various wave lengths and rudder rates drifting of turning trajectories wave induced motions and effect of different rudder rates on turning and zig zag motions were analyzed thoroughly based on experimental results elshiekh 2014 conducted repeated turning and zig zag tests of the onr tumblehome in heading beam and following regular waves with various froude numbers and wave lengths uncertainty analyses were performed complete time histories of wave induced motions and trajectories were presented hasnan et al 2019 conducted repeated turning tests of kvlcc2 and kcs in short crest irregular waves the influence of approach speed on drifting distance and direction was investigated variations of turning trajectories under different wave patterns with the same spectrum were found to be negligible however variations of wave induced motions under different wave patterns were not discussed in the paper due to the high cost of model tests several numerical models for the simulation of ship maneuvering in waves have been developed yasukawa 2006 developed a 4dof surge sway yaw roll mmg based model considering 2nd order mean drift forces in both regular and irregular waves through comparison with experimental results the model was proved to be able to predict the drifting of the turning trajectory with practical accuracy in order to simulate wave induced motions while ship turning yasukawa 2006 further added a 6dof nsm based model for high frequency seakeeping motions into the original 4dof mmg based model forming a model with 10 motion equations the predicted wave induced motions were only compared qualitatively with experimental results the overall tendency of motion amplitude and encounter frequency variations while ship turning was captured through visual inspection sutulo and guedes soares 2006 developed a new maneuvering and seakeeping 6dof model considering nonlinear hydrostatic and froude krylov forces and linear radiation and diffraction forces preliminary simulation results were encouraging as they demonstrating turning trajectories in waves and wave induced motions being in accordance with patterns presented by model experiments recently the unified method also referred as two time scale method which solves the rapidly varying seakeeping motion and slowly varying maneuvering motion separately in two time scales is developed to simulate ship maneuvering in waves skejic and faltinsen 2008 developed a time efficient unified model for ship maneuvering in waves the seakeeping model was estimated using the stf method different methods for mean 2nd order drift loads were used to investigate their applicability on predicting the drifting of turning trajectory in regular waves furthermore skejic and faltinsen 2013 investigated turning motions in long crest irregular waves using this unified model the drifting of the turning trajectory was found to be proportional to the h 1 3 of the irregular wave slow drift 2nd order wave loads based on newman s approximation was considered its effect on the ship turning trajectory seemed to be same as that of the mean 2nd order wave loads and the oscillating time varying part had a negligible effect however this was not the case for ship speed and drift angle wave induced motions were not discussed in their papers seo and kim 2011 investigated ship turning in regular waves and wave induced motions also using the coupled maneuvering and seakeeping model in which wave forces were obtained by the 3d rankine panel method in time domain the predicted turning trajectories showed a fair agreement with experiments however an overall time delay was observed for the predicted wave induced motions zhang et al 2017 and zhang and zou 2016 developed a similar unified model with a different boundary value problem bvp for the wave potential to simulate turning trajectories in regular waves and wave induced motions it was found through qualitative comparison that there were also clear discrepancies between predicted wave induced motions and experimental ones from the literature review it can be found that predicted wave induced motions while ship turning are only validated qualitatively and clear discrepancies with test results can be observed through visual inspection therefore comparing to former studies this paper intends to go one small step further to conduct a more quantitative comparison of wave induced pitch and roll motions while ship turning between numerical simulations and model experiments the numerical model developed is a time efficient weakly coupled 6dof maneuvering and seakeeping unified model proposed by yu et al 2017 which is similar to the model proposed by skejic and faltinsen 2008 in the 5dof seakeeping part like sutulo and guedes soares 2006 froude krylov forces are calculated non linearly while radiation and diffraction forces are calculated linearly using the stf method and irf approach the maneuvering part is a typical 3dof mmg model the maneuvering and seakeeping parts are weakly coupled the seakeeping motion is simulated based on the ship speed and heading provided by the maneuvering part while mean 2nd order drift forces acting on the maneuvering motion are calculated by the seakeeping part both the maneuvering and seakeeping parts are fully validated numerical simulations of turning in regular and long crest irregular waves of the s175 containership are performed using the proposed model simulation results of turning trajectories and wave induced motions in regular waves are compared with experimental results presented in xu 2015 satisfactory agreements are observed in irregular waves turning motions are simulated under different wave patterns with the same spectrum wave induced motions under different wave patterns are investigated 2 dynamic modeling in the 6dof weakly coupled model the maneuvering model is a 3dof mmg model ogawa and kasai 1978 while the seakeeping model is a 5dof sway heave roll pitch yaw weakly nonlinear model based on the impulse response function irf approach cummins 1962 the maneuvering and seakeeping motions are combined under the same coordinate system based on unify theory proposed by skejic and faltinsen 2008 details on the 6dof weakly coupled model are described in this section 2 1 coordinate system in

solved with different time steps using 4th order runge kutta method and then combined together the detailed procedure of the unified model is presented in fig 4 in the unified model the slow varying maneuvering motion is simulated using a larger time step comparing to the fast varying seakeeping motion within each time step of maneuvering the seakeeping motion is simulated by several time steps under a constant condition i e the ship speed wave angle χ and ship position which are related to the maneuvering motion are kept constant in this paper the time step of the maneuvering model δt is set as 2 s and the seakeeping time step δt is set as 0 1 s then the total motion under the horizontal body axes o xhyhzh is calculated by combining the two motions together 19 ν t ν s ν m u t v t w t

where the subscript t indicates the total motion based on the total motion including ship total speed and wave encounter angle new irfs and mean drift forces are calculated and used in the calculation of seakeeping and maneuvering motions in the next time step in the model seakeeping and maneuvering models are still simulated separately under their own assumption the coupling between the two models is simply through the total motion obtain by the linear superposition thus the 6dof model based on the unify theory is considered to be a weakly coupled model moreover the model is time efficient because no time consuming calculations such as 3d bvp and cfd calculation are included in the model 3 model validation 3 1 ship specification the subject ship used for model validation is the s175 containership which has been widely used as the benchmark for ship maneuvering in waves the designed main particulars of the ship propeller rudder as well as model scale factor 57 686 are presented in table 1 model experiments of s175 maneuvering in waves are carried out in the ocean engineering model basin of shanghai jiao tong university xu 2015 zhang and zou 2016 all the other data needed for simulation including the hydrodynamic derivatives rudder and propeller factors can be found in the yasukawa 2006 the empirical formula in eqs 7 and 9 are not used since coefficients in these formula have been provided by yasukawa 2006 the sway and yaw artificial natural periods t 2 and t 6 are set as 80s and 100s 3 2 validation of the seakeeping model in order to validate the 5dof seakeeping model motion raos in different ship speed wave frequencies are calculated in the time domain using the 5dof model results in the time domain are transferred into the frequency domain using the fourier transform ft and compared with results obtained in the frequency domain using the stf method comparison results are presented in fig 5 from the figure it can be found that the motion raos calculated in the time domain square dots agree very well with those obtained by the stf method in the frequency domain thin lines moreover calculated heave and pitch raos under heading waves with fn 0 25 and roll raos under beam waves with fn 0 are compared with experimental results diamond and square dots presented by fonseca and guedes soares 2004 and xu 2015 as shown in figs 6 and 7 mean drift force coefficients c xwd c ywd c nwd are calculated and compared with experimental results in fig 8 it can be found that there is no large difference between experimental and simulation results thus the seakeeping part of the proposed 6dof model is validated 3 3 validation of the maneuvering model the 3dof maneuvering model is validated by comparing simulated 35 turning trajectories in calm water with experimental results provided by xu 2015 comparison results are shown in fig 9 in the figure simulated 35 turning trajectories are plotted in black solid and dashed lines while experimental 35 turning trajectories is plotted in red square and round dots it can be observed that simulated trajectories agree quite well with experimental ones especially for the 35 turning advance and tactical diameters between simulations and experiments have very few differences comparison results show good agreements between simulations and experiments thus the maneuvering part of the proposed 6dof model is validated moreover in fig 10 the steady heel generated when ship turning in calm water is simulated using the 6dof model and compared with experimental result presented in xu 2015 under the real ship scale from the figure it is found that the simulated black solid line and measured red dotted line steady heels are almost the same which is around 0 8 moreover it can be observed from both simulated and measured heel angles that the ship heels inward immediately due to the rudder roll moment and then outward due to centrifugal force z h y h 4 results and disscussions in this section the proposed time efficient weakly coupled 6dof maneuvering and seakeeping unified simulation model is applied to simulate maneuvering in regular and long crest irregular waves of the s175 containership simulation results are compared with experimental ones 4 1 experiment setup and cases free running model experiments of s175 maneuveing in waves are carried out in the ocean engineering model basin of shanghai jiao tong university xu 2015 which is 50m long 30m wide and 6m deep the self propelled model ship shown in fig 11 is made by frp and equipped with rudder and propeller the model scale factor is 57 686 the model is driven by a dc motor and steered by a steering motor with autopilot system during the experiment shown in fig 12 the model ship maneuvers in the wave generated by the flap type wave maker under commanded rudder and propeller actions meanwhile pitch roll and yaw angles of the model ship are measured by onboard gyroscopes the trajectory and ship speed are measured by the ccd camera positioning system rudder angle and propeller rate are also measured all the measured data are transmitted to the onshore computer wirelessly more details on the experiment can be found in xu 2015 in table 2 measured parameters of the model ship which are different from parameters of the designed ship in table 1 are presented during the experiment test cases in regular waves with different wave lengths and initial wave directions are selected as shown in table 3 the designed initial froude number of the ship is set as 0 15 which is 0 818 m s in model scale however due to the limited tank length the ship cannot reach the designed initial speed while turning the actual measured initial speed as shown in table 3 is less than the designed one during the simulation the actual measured initial speed is used in order to get a better agreement with experiment results moreover it needs to be mentioned that some irrational long period variations in the measured pitch angle data are observed as shown in figure 13 unfiltered data this is caused by the interference on the zero drift of the gyro sensor therefore these irrational long period variations are filtered using the 7th order highpass butterworth filter while analysing in fig 13 the red dash dot line is the unfiltered data while the black solid line is the filtered data 4 2 results of ship turning in regular waves in this section the proposed weakly coupled 6dof model is applied to simulate the s175 turning in regular waves under cases presented in table 3 simulation results are compared with experimental results under the real ship scale during the simulation the actual measured initial speed is used results of all 10 cases are plotted in figs 14 23 in each figure lines and markers in red color represent experimental results while lines and markers in black color are simulation results there are 5 graphs in each figure the top left graph is the turning trajectory while the top right graph represents the ship speed the second graph shows the heading angle dotted line and the rudder angle solid line the third and fourth graphs are roll and pitch angle respectively firstly general phenomena of ship turning in regular waves are observed and analyzed for experimental results shown in red lines and markers from experimental results it is found that the turning trajectory tends to drift downstream due to the mean drift force because mean drift forces of sway and yaw shown in fig 8 are large when λ l pp less than 1 00 the drifting of the turning trajectory in both heading and beam waves is more significant when λ l pp 0 50 and 0 70 comparing to λ l pp 1 00 1 20 and 1 40 the speed loss can be also observed while ship turning in waves moreover it can be found that amplitudes and frequencies of wave induced roll and pitch motions change with the wave encounter angle η and encounter frequency ω e take fig 16 as an example when t 100s the ship is mainly sailing in the heading wave thus the roll amplitude is small and the pitch amplitude and frequency are high owing to the high encounter frequency in the heading wave around t 150s the wave encounter angle is about 90 and the ship is sailing in beam wave therefore the roll amplitude grows large and the pitch amplitude becomes small when 150s t 400s the ship is turning from beam wave to following wave and back to beam wave the pitch frequency becomes low due to the decreasing of the encounter frequency as ship turning the wave encounter angle and frequency change among head wave beam wave and following wave repeatedly which leads to the changes of amplitudes and frequencies of wave induced roll and pitch motions as described above then comparisons between simulations and experiments are analyzed from the comparison it is found that the simulation model can capture the typical phenomena while ship turning in waves including drifting of turning trajectories and variations on amplitudes and frequencies of wave induced motions in general simulation results are in good agreement with experimental results although it is very difficult to yield a universal agreement for all cases using the proposed weakly coupled model some comparison results are quite encouraging with surprisingly good agreements especially for the ship speed heading and pitch angle for turning trajectories the advance diameter and the trend of drifting show fair agreements except for case no 7 for case no 7 with λ l pp 0 70 the large discrepancies on turning trajectories is probably caused by the neglecting of drift force due to short wave reflection in the proposed model for ship speeds and headings agreements between simulations and experiments are very good in both speed loss and variation for wave induced pitch motions simulation results are almost identical with experimental results not only in variations of amplitudes but also in changes of frequencies especially for cases with long wave length λ l pp 0 70 comparing to the pitch motion simulated roll motions have larger discrepancies with experiment roll motions this is probably because the roll viscous damping is obtained from calm water free roll decay tests under zero speed which is not accurate enough for cases with non zero speed and changing encounter frequencies generally speaking according to the comparison results the proposed time efficient and weakly coupled 6dof simulation model shows very good potential in the accurate prediction of ship maneuvering in waves 4 3 results of ship turning in irregular waves in this section the ship turning in long crest irregular waves is investigated based on simulation results during the simulation the irregular wave spectrum is ittc spectrum 21 s α ω 173 h 1 3 2 t 1 4 ω 5 exp 691 t 1 4 ω 4 where h 1 3 is the significant wave height and t 1 is the wave period three cases with different h 1 3 and t 1 are chosen as presented in table 4 in each irregular wave case the simulation is repeated for 5 times with different wave patterns generated using different sets of random phase θ i under the same spectrum simulation results in irregular waves are plotted in figs 24 26 phenomena similar as regular waves such as drifting of turning trajectories and variations of wave induced motions can be observed the downstream drifting of turning trajectory becomes larger as h 1 3 grows although variations of amplitudes and frequencies are essential for motions in irregular waves it can still be observed that the roll amplitude dies out in heading waves and the pitch amplitude dies out in beam waves which are typical phenomena of ship turning in waves moreover time histories and spectrums obtained by froude transform ft of wave induced motions in repeated tests under different wave patterns are analyzed and plotted in figs 27 29 from motion time histories in figures it is further confirmed that the roll amplitude dies out in heading waves and the pitch amplitude dies out in beam waves this strong phenomenon appears in all different wave patterns and cases from motion spectrum results it is obvious that roll and pitch spectrums under different wave patterns with the same case are completely different in the roll spectrum there is a clear peak which is around the roll natural frequency however there is no clear peak in the pitch spectrum the pitch spectrum seems to be evenly distributed over the main frequency range of the incident wave 4 4 discussions on the simulation model during the simulation the time step of the maneuvering model δt is set as 2 s and the seakeeping time step δt is set as 0 1 s this configuration is determined by evaluating the balance between the time efficiency and accuracy of the model to demonstrate the influence of time steps δt and δt on the time efficiency and accuracy of the model different sets of δt and δt are chosen as shown in table 5 because the most time consuming part of the simulation model is the calculation of new irfs and mean drift forces in the beginning of each maneuvering iteration using the stf method with new ship speed u and wave encounter angle η therefore the less number of maneuvering iterations the less calculation time in sets no 1 2 and 3 the maneuvering time step δt is set as 1s 2s and 3s corresponding to 1200 600 and 400 times of maneuvering iterations with a total simulation time of 1200s moreover in set no 4 the time consuming calculation of new irfs and mean drift forces is conducted only when δu 0 2 m s or δη 3 not in each maneuvering iteration the simulation program runs on single core of the cpu i9 9900k 3 6 4 8 ghz while four core parallel computing is applied only on the part of pressure integration over instantaneous wetted surfaces for nonlinear restoring and f k forces the total calculation time and simulation results of all these sets are presented in table 5 and figs 30 and 31 from table 5 it is obvious that the calculation time is nearly proportional to the number of maneuvering iterations set no 4 is the most time efficient due to least number of time consuming calculation conducted from turning trajectories and wave induced roll and pitch motions shown in figs 30 and 31 it is observed that the wave induced roll and pitch motions of set no 1 2 and 3 are almost the same while turning trajectories are slightly different due to the numerical error caused by large time step the turning trajectory is more accurate with smaller maneuvering time step however smaller maneuvering time step causes longer calculation time such as set no 3 it can be observed from fig 30 that the turning trajectory of set no 2 is very close to set no 3 with only half of the calculation time therefore set no 2 is chosen during the simulation because it yields a balance between the time efficiency and accuracy although there are some discrepancies between simulation results of set no 4 and set no 2 these discrepancies are not significant and are practically acceptable given the considerable short calculation time of set no 4 it is highly suitable for the scenario where calculation time is the major concern 5 conclusions a 6dof weakly coupled maneuvering and seakeeping unified time domain simulation model is proposed for the simulation of ship turning in waves in the model a 3dof surge sway yaw maneuvering model and a 5dof sway heave roll pitch yaw seakeeping model are coupled weakly based on the unify theory the maneuvering and seakeeping parts of the time domain model are fully validated through comparison with the frequency domain method and experiments the model is applied for the simulation of turning tests of the s175 containership in regular and long crest irregular waves through comparisons between simulation and experimental results following conclusions are drawn the model is fully capable of reproducing the drifting of turning circles and the variations on amplitudes and frequencies of the wave induced motion while ship turning in regular and irregular waves although it is very difficult to yield a universal agreement for all cases using the simulation model some comparison results in regular waves are quite encouraging with surprisingly good agreements simulation results of wave induced pitch motion are almost identical with experimental results not only in variations of amplitudes but also in changes of frequencies especially for cases with long wave length λ l pp 0 70 good agreements are also observed for the ship speed for turning trajectories and roll motions simulation results show a satisfactory agreement on overall tendency in irregular waves ship turning motions are simulated under different wave patterns with the same spectrum although variations of amplitudes and frequencies are essential for motions in irregular waves it can still be observed that the roll amplitude dies out in heading waves and the pitch amplitude dies out in beam waves which are typical phenomena of ship turning in waves from motion spectrums obtained by froude transform it is found that spectrums of pitch and roll motions under different wave patterns have large discrepancies through evaluating the balance between the time efficiency and accuracy time steps of maneuvering and seakeeping motion are set as δt 2s δt 0 1s moreover set no 4 in which the time consuming calculation of new irfs and mean drift forces is conducted only when δu 0 2 m s or δη 3 is highly time efficient with practically acceptable accuracy the proposed time efficient and weakly coupled 6dof simulation model shows very good potential in accurate prediction of ship maneuvering in waves in future works the proposed model can be used to simulate ship turning in short crest irregular waves and zig zag motions in waves moreover other than the simulation of maneuvering motions in waves the time efficient model can also be applied to the simulation of ship general 6dof motions in waves credit authorship contribution

20941,the calculation of stress components in tensile armour wires of flexible pipes subjected to combined tension and bending is challenging given the intrinsic geometrical and physical nonlinearities mechanical loading simulation in finite element models yields heterogeneous curvature distribution directly impacting stress evaluation addition of two auxiliary thermal layers internally and externally subjected to radial and longitudinal thermal expansions simulates equivalent axisymmetric loading achieving relatively uniform curvature distribution calculation of equivalent thermal loads and expansion coefficients involves time consuming trial and error processes by running several finite element models therefore a theoretical formulation that takes into consideration thermal sheaths with orthotropic thermal expansion coefficients and respective thermal loads is developed a three dimensional finite element model is also developed for direct application of axisymmetric mechanical or equivalent thermal loadings a 6 flexible pipe is employed in a case study to compare the finite element model results within themselves and with the analytical mechanical and thermal models the analytical results are shown to be rigorously identical the finite element models present small differences when compared to the analytical results allowing combined application of thermal and bending loading that results in constant curvature away from the boundaries keywords flexible pipe thermal load orthotropic composite analytical model finite element model 1 introduction unbonded flexible pipes have been widely employed as risers and flowlines to transport oil and gas between the wellhead and floating production units in deep waters the flexible pipe is composed of several steel and polymeric layers to simultaneously provide mechanical strength leak tightness and flexibility a typical cross section of unbonded flexible pipe is designed as composite structures comprising several different layers the carcass and pressure armour respectively withstand the seawater external pressure and provides the internal pressure load bearing capacity the polymeric layers including internal pressure sheath anti wear tapes and outer sheath are respectively employed to seal internal fluid reduce friction and wear between metal contacting layers and protect tensile armour layers from seawater corrosion the tensile armour layers one of the most structural crucial components concomitantly provide high tensile stiffness and low bending stiffness the precise evaluation of cyclic stresses in tensile armour layers caused by combined tension and bending loading is of paramount importance for the flexible riser fatigue life assessment accordingly the mechanical behaviour of tensile armour layers subjected to tension and bending loads is still an important research topic the current analysis methods are broadly divided into analytical and finite element methods in the first approach the axisymmetric and bending loads are treated separately and many simplifying assumptions are required whereas in the numerical modeling perspective less suppositions are usually postulated but solution entails high computational cost for analytical methods concerning axisymmetric loading analysis knapp 1979 derived a stiffness matrix for helically armoured cables based on energy theory considering the core compressibility material non linearity and large deformations witz and tan 1992 studied the mechanical behaviour of flexible pipes umbilical and marine cables under tension and torsional moment the umbilical and flexible pipe were divided into two basic components cylindrical and helical elements the analytical and experimental results for elongation versus axial load were compared and good agreement was found between them yue et al 2013 derived an analytical model to predict the tension behaviour of flexible pipes in which the effect of radial stiffness on the tension stiffness was investigated tension tests of an umbilical were carried out and there was a good agreement between analytical and experimental predictions liu and vaz 2016a derived an innovative analytical model from an equivalent linear elastic axisymmetric model by invoking the elastic viscoelastic correspondence principle to predict the axisymmetric viscoelastic response of flexible pipes subjected to axisymmetric loads in the time domain ramos and kawano 2015 made some additional contributions to the structural response of flexible pipes subjected to axisymmetric loads including the effect of both internal and external pressures in pipe displacements yan et al 2019 presented a multi scale analysis methodology to research the effective stiffnesses and local stresses of helically wound structures for bending analysis several analytical models have been proposed to predict the circumferential distribution of stresses for one tensile armour wire wound around a cylindrical toroidal surface i e the pipe is subjected to constant curvature usually prescribing that the deflected wire bent configuration may either follow loxodromic wiek 1986 skeie et al 2012 or geodesic curves féret and bournazel 1987 out 1997 additionally some scholars feret et al 1995 zhou and vaz 2017 investigated the flexible pipe behaviour subjected to combined tension and bending loading considering the friction interaction between adjacent layers however numerical analysis in this sense is required to solve the complex system of nonlinear partial differential equations as the axisymmetric response is well characterized analytically finite element methods have been mostly focused on describing the flexible pipe bending response sævik 1993 developed an eight degree of freedom curved beam element for the purpose of obtaining stresses and slips in the armour wires later sævik and bruaseth 2005 proposed a finite element formulation for predicting the complex response of umbilical cross sections subjected to loading from tension torsional moment internal and external pressures and external contact bodies to estimate stresses and displacements of an individual element as well as the overall structural response ribeiro et al 2003 introduced a three dimensional finite element model to predict the local mechanical behaviour for flexible pipes subjected to tension or compression the results are compared to those obtained with a previously reported analytical model and good agreement was found between them edmans et al 2012 developed a finite element model to describe the nonlinear behaviour of flexible pipes subjected to combined axisymmetric and bending loads malta and martins 2014 established an explicit finite element model to investigate the mechanical behaviour of flexible pipes subjected to axial compression intrinsic nonlinearities including contact clearance friction plasticity and large displacements are taken into account in the model bai et al 2015 developed analytical and 3d finite element models to investigate the mechanical behaviour of umbilical cables under tension and internal pressure and the mechanical response correlation between the numerical and theoretical models validated their applicability sousa et al de sousa and magluta 2013 studied the behaviour of flexible pipes subjected to combined tension and internal pressure by using the finite element method and good correlations were reported between fem and experimental results majed majed and cooper 2013 demonstrated an advanced method of analysis that is capable of incorporating detailed finite element models into large fully nonlinear dynamic simulations yoo et al 2017 established detailed three dimensional finite element models subjected to axial tensile and compressive loads considering material nonlinearity to investigate ultimate tensile and compressive strength failure mechanisms cornacchia et al 2019 investigated the tensile behaviour of the pipe by theoretical model and fem considering the plastic behaviour for all the layers most of the above models fail to represent a segment of flexible pipe with constant curvature in view of this shortcoming lukassen et al lyckegaard et al 2018 established a repeated unit cell finite element model ruc fem to reproduce the nonlinear bending behaviour of flexible risers subjected to combined constant tension and constant curvature reference points are connected to the nodes on the internal surface of the perfectly circular core layer with kinematic coupling constraints which makes the core rigid in the radial direction neglecting its interconnected ovalization at present three reported finite element models zhou and vaz 2017 sævik 1993 lyckegaard et al 2018 and lu et al 2020 can be used to describe the mechanical behaviour of flexible pipes subjected to axisymmetric loading and constant curvature lu et al 2020 established an alternative finite element model fem in which an equivalent thermal loading and orthotropic coefficients of thermal expansions are introduced on the external sheath to substitute a pure tension load and to ensure a uniform curvature distribution along the flexible pipe away from its ends however the equivalent thermal load and coefficient of thermal expansions are determined by fem trial and error attempts which results in larger calculation cost in addition it is more difficult to determine those values when considering the internal and external pressures therefore the main purpose of this paper is to develop an analytical rational axisymmetric model that takes into consideration the addition of internal and external thermal sheaths and their respective required thermal loads capable of mimicking the same behaviour of the mechanically loaded structure to determine the equivalent orthotropic thermal strains the main contributions are orthotropic coefficients of thermal expansions for those auxiliary layers are defined to impose the same internal and external pressures and tension or compression loads the equivalent thermal model results in the same contact pressures global deformations and axial forces from the axisymmetric mechanical analytical model based on the analytical model finite element models for both mechanically and thermally loaded structures are also developed and the results compared with the analytical models finally bending steps are added to both finite element models and curvature distributions are compared 2 axisymmetric analytical models the flexible pipe is idealized as composed of helical and cylindrical elements the tensile armour wires are regarded as helical layers and in the mathematical treatment high order small terms are neglected i e geometrical and physical nonlinearities are ignored but bending and torsional stiffness of the wires are retained the interlocked carcass and pressure layer may be equally modelled as helical layers but in the present context they are alternatively considered as orthotropic thick walled cylindrical layers and its formulation presented without any loss to the analysis the polymeric elements such as the inner pressure barrier liner anti wear tapes and external sheath can be categorized as thick walled isotropic cylindrical layers assuming small deformations and linear elastic materials the cylinder and helix deformations are shown to be directly proportional to the axisymmetric loading and the proportionality coefficients depend on the characteristic material and geometrical parameters for the cylindrical elements a thick walled elastic theory is invoked for the helical elements differential geometry concepts and love s equations are employed both layers are schematically represented in fig 1 the relationship between the axial force f torsional moment m and internal and external pressures p i and p e respectively herein named axisymmetric loading and corresponding element axisymmetric deformations δ l δ r δ t and δ θ for cylindrical and helical elements with initial length l mean radius r thickness t and twist θ 0 0 are derived for instance in liu liu and vaz 2016b the axisymmetric model construction follows initially the description of the helical element including a definition of geometrical and equilibrium equations taking into account the armour wire cross section bending and torsional stiffness the behaviour of isotropic and orthotropic cylindrical elements subjected to mechanical loading is then presented followed by the formulation development for cylindrical elements exposed to simultaneously thermal and mechanical loading in this regard the material is assumed thermally orthotropic with linear thermal expansion coefficients and mechanical properties assumed temperature independent next contact continuity conditions in the interface of the cylindrical and helical layers global equilibrium equations and the solution procedure strategy are presented 2 1 helical element modeling the analytical model for the helical elements is developed on the basis of several hypotheses regarding the regularity of the initial geometry and linearity of the response which are the wires are wound on a perfectly cylindrical surface following a cylindrical helix the wire cross section is rectangular the wires maintain a helical configuration when deformed the material is linear elastic the variations in armour wires thickness length radius and pitch angle are linear and small friction mechanisms are not taken into consideration the shear stress at the interfaces of the layers is negligible 2 1 1 geometrical equations the initial curvatures zhou and vaz 2017 tang et al 2015 in normal binormal and tangent directions respectively κ n κ b and κ i are given by 1 κ n sin 2 α r κ b 0 κ t sin α cos α r a b c where α is the helical angle in respect to its generatrix and r is defined in fig 1 the armour wire strain in the tangential direction may be shown to be related to the layer deformations δ r δ θ and δ l 2 ε t sin 2 α δ r r sin α cos α r δ θ l cos 2 α δ l l similarly the helical angle variation δ α relation to the layer deformations is 3 δ α sin α cos α δ r r cos 2 α r δ θ l sin α cos α δ l l therefore upon application of the axisymmetric loading the curvature variations in normal binormal and tangent directions δ κ n δ κ b and δ κ t may be written as 4 δ κ n sin 2 α r δ α sin 2 α r δ r r a δ κ b 0 b δ κ t cos 2 α r δ α sin α cos α r δ r r c 2 1 2 mechanical equilibrium equations the helical wires are treated as spatially curved beams supported by a cylindrical surface and the clebsch kirchhoff static differential equilibrium equations are widely employed by many authors such as love 1927 and ericksen and truesdell 1957 when using a local coordinate system the equations are developed into 5 d f t d s κ n f n κ b f b q t 0 a d f n d s κ

represent the cross section force and moment components on tangential normal and binormal directions respectively the component distributed forces and moments on tangential normal and binormal directions are respectively q t q n q b and m t m n m b and s corresponds to the arc length the bending moment components and respective curvature variations are expressed by 6 m n e i n δ κ b m b e i b δ κ n m t g i t δ κ t a b c where e and g respectively represent elastic and shear moduli i n and i b are the second moment of the area on normal and binormal directions i t is a representative polar moment of area for torsion of rectangular beams and δ κ n δ κ b and δ κ t are determined from equation 4 as friction mechanisms and shear stresses at the interfaces of the layers are not taken into consideration the transfer of forces between adjacent layers occurs only in the radial direction so q t q b m n 0 the normal tangential and torsional curvatures and the component sectional forces and moments are constant along the arc length hence their derivatives with respect to s are zero finally in view of the above particularities equation 5 are reduced to two expressions to calculate f b and q n 7 f b κ n m t κ t m b q n κ t κ n m t κ t m b κ n f t a b where κ n κ t and m t m n m b are respectively determined from equations 1 and 6 and an explicit expression for f t will be revealed later in equation 10 the tangential stress is described as the tangential force divided by the cross sectional area the compressive stress in the normal radial direction on the neutral line is approximately taken as the average of the contact pressures acting on the internal and external wire surfaces while no lateral contact is allowed therefore the stress components in the helical wire are then mathematically expressed as 8 σ t f t a σ n p i p e 2 σ b 0 a b c where a is the wire cross section area due to the axisymmetric nature of the loading applied to the flexible pipe and invoking the generalized hooke s law the strain components related to the stresses given by equations 8a c reduce to 9 ε t σ t ν σ n e f t e a ν p i p e 2 e a ε n σ n ν σ t e p i p e 2 e ν f t e a b ε b ν σ t σ n e ν f t e a ν p i p e 2 e c where ν is the poisson s ratio of the armour wire combining equations 2 and 9 a the force component in the tangential direction is 10 f t e a sin 2 α δ r r sin

2 α δ r r sin α cos α r δ θ l cos 2 α δ l l furthermore the distributed force on the normal direction may be expressed as equal to the difference between the contact pressures on the inner and outer surfaces of the helical wire i e q n w p e p i thus equation 7 b reduces to 12 p e p i e a w r ℑ 1 δ r r r ℑ 2 δ θ l ℑ 3 δ l l a ν sin 2 α 2 w r p e p i where w is the wire width and the constants ℑ 1

2 α i b a r 2 cos 2 α sin 2 α g i t e a r 2 the equilibrium equation transformation for axisymmetric loads under global cylindrical and local material coordinates can be expressed as 13 f θ f z m θ m z f t f b f b f t m t m b m b m t sin α δ α cos α δ α based on the moment equilibrium equation 13 combined with equations 1 6 and 7 a the relationship between the total axial force and deformations in a helical armour wires layer can be expressed by 14 f n f z n e a 1 δ r r 2 r δ θ l 3 δ l l n a ν cos α 2 p e p i where the constants 1 2 and 3 are defined as 1 cos α sin 2 α 1 sin 2 α cos 2 α i b a r

the total moment and deformation in helical armour wires layer can be written as 15 m n m z n e a r ℵ 1 δ r r r ℵ 2 δ θ l ℵ 3 δ l l n a ν r sin α 2 p e p i where the symbols ℵ 1 ℵ 2 and ℵ 3 denote ℵ 1

cos 2 α cos 2 α g i t e a r 2 the constants ℑ 1 ℑ 2 ℑ 3 1 2 3 ℵ 1 ℵ 2 ℵ 3 are functions of geometrical and material properties of the armour wire cross section and their impact on the axisymmetric analysis is usually small finally the mechanical behaviour of helical element axisymmetric loads f m p i p e and deformations δ l δ r δ t δ θ can be summarized and represented by equations 11 12 14 and 15 it is observed that for the helical layers the full set of deformations linearly depend on all loads described in the full set of axisymmetric loads in other words any load applied isolated trigger all set of deformations 2 2 cylindrical element modeling the analytical model for thick walled cylindrical elements subjected to axisymmetric loading assumes plane analysis and linear geometrical and physical behaviour initially the response of a thick walled isotropic elastic cylinder liu and vaz 2016b is summarized and next the formulations for the responses of the orthotropic elastic cylinder and orthotropic thermal expansion are presented herakovich 1998 2 2 1 mechanical loading 2 2 1 1 isotropic material formulation the element deformations and loads are directly

area observe that the deformations δ l δ r and δ t and δ θ respectively do not depend on m and f p i and p e for cylindrical elements i e the response is uncoupled 2 2 1 2 orthotropic linear material formulation ribeiro et al 2003 introduced an alternative equivalent orthotropic material to represent the carcass and pressure amour in finite element modeling given that the helical pitch angles of those layers are nearly 90 this approach may be also conveniently applied to axisymmetric analytical formulations in principal cylindrical coordinates the compliance coefficients for an orthotropic linear material can be expressed by related engineering constants herakovich 1998 thus the strain stress relationships may be written as 17 ε z ε θ ε ρ 1 e z ν θ z e θ ν ρ z e r ν z θ e z 1 e θ ν ρ θ

that can be readily calculated the strain displacement relationship for small deformations can be written as timoshenko 1951 19 ε z u z z ε θ u ρ ρ ε ρ u ρ ρ γ z ρ 0 γ z θ u θ z γ θ ρ u θ ρ u θ ρ where the longitudinal circumferential and radial displacement fields are respectively u z z u θ z ρ u ρ ρ the axial strain is constant and given by ε z δ l l thus u z z δ l l z the circumferential and radial normal strains given by equation 19 solely depend on the radial coordinate ρ the shear stress and strain τ z ρ γ z ρ are null it is assumed absence of shear stresses on both inner and outer surfaces τ θ ρ r i 0 τ θ ρ r e 0 so it can be shown that τ θ ρ and γ θ ρ are also zero the equilibrium equation in an infinitesimal element is then 20 d σ ρ d ρ σ ρ σ θ ρ 0 the relationship between the remaining shear stresses and strains with the displacement field u θ z ρ and ultimately the longitudinal and radial coordinates z and ρ is developed later invoking the first order uncoupled homogeneous linear differential equation 20 combining equations 18a 19 and 20 a second order nonhomogeneous linear differential equation for u ρ related to the radial coordinate ρ global longitudinal

then the boundary conditions are expressed as 22 σ ρ r i p i σ ρ r e p e substituting equation 21 in 19 and then in 18 a and using equation 22 the integration constants d 1 and d 2 can be promptly determined those constants are then directly proportional to the internal and external pressures and global axial strain and also depend on material stiffness constants inner and outer radii for text conciseness those cumbersome constants are not explicitly shown here therefore the normal stress and strain fields are completed characterized the thickness variation may then be readily calculated from the difference between the radial displacements at the inner and external radii δ t u ρ r e u ρ r i as 23 δ t d 1 r e β r i β d 2 r e β r i β c 12 c 13 c 33 c 22 r e r i δ l l besides the radius

strain fields are fully determined assuming that the cylindrical element is subjected to axial force and torsional moment f and m then 27 f 2 π r i r e σ z ρ ρ d ρ m 2 π r i r e τ z θ ρ ρ 2 d ρ combining equations 18 19 21 and 27 then the axial force f subjected to internal and external pressures may be calculated as 28 f 2 π r t c 11 c 12 c 13 c 12 c 13 c 33 c 22 δ l l 2 π β 1 c 12 β c 13 r

behaviour of orthotropic cylindrical element can be expressed by equations 23 24 28 and 28 2 2 2 thermal loading consider now a thick cylindrical element subjected to a thermal load t the thermal load represents the temperature increment relative to an initial reference temperature therefore longitudinal circumferential and radial thermal induced strains and stresses may be originated the isotropic elastic material is assumed thermally orthotropic with linear thermal expansion coefficients equal in radial and circumferential directions α t and possibly different in the longitudinal direction α z the material elastic constants e and ν are assumed temperature independent according to the classical theory of elasticity timoshenko 1951 it is assumed that the thermal load is taken to be symmetrical about the axis and independent of the axial coordinate thence the thermal induced stresses in radial and circumferential directions respectively σ ρ t and σ θ t subjected to thermal load may vary through the thickness and are respectively given by 29 σ ρ t e α t 1 ν ρ 2 ρ 2 r i 2 r e 2 r i 2 r i r e t ρ d ρ r i ρ t ρ d ρ σ θ t e α t 1 ν ρ 2 ρ 2 r i 2 r e 2 r i 2 r i r e t ρ d ρ r i ρ

reads for the cylinder cross sectional area 2 3 contact continuity assume a flexible pipe consisting of n layers n h of which are polymeric cylindrical layers the gap between adjacent layers is denoted g j j 1 then the relationship between the thickness and radius variations in adjacent layers j and j 1 translates to 37 δ r j 1 δ r j δ t j δ t j 1 2 g j j 1 j 1 2 n 1 the gap g j j 1 may be either closed or open respectively expressed as g j j 1 0 or g j j 1 0 the continuity of the contact pressure between adjacent layers depends on the gap value as follows a no gap between adjacent layers g j j 1 0 the relationship of contact pressure between adjacent layers is 38 p e j p i j 1 p j j 1 j 1 2 n 1 p e n p e t p i 1 p i t where p e j and p i j 1 respectively correspond to the external and internal pressures of the j th and j 1 th layer j 1 and j n respectively correspond to the inner and outer layers and p e t p i t are respectively the flexible pipe external hydrostatic and internal pressures b gap between adjacent layers g j j 1 0 the corresponding contact pressure between j th and j 1 th layer is then zero the continuity of contact pressure between adjacent layers can be expressed as 39 p e j p i j 1 0 p e n p e t p i 1 p i t it can be observed that the contact pressure p j j 1 and gap g j j 1 cannot be simultaneously the unknown parameters i e when one is unknown the other one must be equal to zero 2 4 global equilibrium the sum of the axial forces and torsional moments acting on each layer are respectively equal to the total wall force f w and torsional moment m t therefore the axial force equilibrium equation and torsional moment for a flexible pipe are given by 40 j 1 n f j f e π p i t r i t 2 π p e t r e t 2 f w f o r i m e c h a n i c a l l o a d f t s i f t s e j 1 n f j f w f o r i i t h e r m a l l o a d 41 j 1 n m j m t where f j are calculated from equation 14 for the helical layers and equation 16 c and 28 respectively for isotropic and orthotropic cylindrical layers subjected to mechanical loads the effective and true wall tensions are respectively f e f w and are related in equation 42 a and f t s i f t s e are calculated from equation 36 c and respectively mean the axial load in the internal and external thermal sheaths the external and internal flexible pipe radii carcass disregarded are respectively r e t r i t similarly the torsional moments m j are respectively calculated in equations 15 and 16 d 28 and 36 d for helical layers isotropic orthotropic and thermal cylindrical layers equation 42 b implies that the sum of the thermal loads in inner and outer thermal sheaths leads to the same magnitude of the specified wall tension but in opposite direction consequently the total force in the structure actual flexible pipe layers plus the two thermal loads is zero 2 5 solution procedure for the flexible riser the axial and torsional strains respectively δ l l and δ θ l must be the same for each layer to calculate the equivalent thermal strains that mimic the axisymmetric model two steps based on different load conditions i e mechanical and thermal loads are discussed 2 5 1 mechanical load at first the mechanical loads comprised of axial wall force f w torque moment m t and external and internal pressures p e t and p i t may be applied isolated or combined to predict the two global deformations δ l l δ θ l n 1 local interlayer contact pressures or gaps between adjacent layers n axial forces and n torque moments in each one of the layers for example besides there are 2 n unknown parameters for radius and thickness variations for the n layers therefore the total number of unknown variables is 5 n 1 as shown in table 1 the corresponding number of algebraic equations is also 5n 1 there are four equilibrium equations for each layer 4n as summarized above besides the number of contact compatibility relationships between thickness and radius variations is n 1 as introduced in equation 37 the sum of forces and moments are respectively shown in equations 40 and 41 as the gap between the layers g j j 1 maybe zero or positive depending on the loading combination at the beginning of the calculation all gaps are designated to be zero after solving the system of equations the contact pressures are checked and if a certain contact pressure p j j 1 is negative then the contact pressure is assigned a zero value and gap becomes the unknown variable and is calculated this process is repeated until all contact pressures are not negative and the calculation process finishes with the parameters considered correctly calculated 2 5 2 thermal load in the next step the required thermal strains that impose the same behaviour in the flexible pipe layers as the mechanically loaded structure are calculated in this case two additional thermal sheaths with orthotropic thermal expansion coefficients are introduced one just above the flexible pipe outer sheath named e and another one inside the flexible pipe named i they are respectively responsible to produce external and internal pressures and axial loads may be originated from any of them their respective equivalent thermal loads t i t e and associated thermal strains α t i t i α z i t i and α t e t e α z e t e are only applied on the thermal sheaths it may be specified without loss of generality that the axial force in a certain thermal sheath is equal to zero by appropriately calculating the required value for the axial thermal strain the total resulting force in the thermal sheaths should then be equal to f w i e f t s i f t s e j 1 n f j where either f t s i f t s e may be zero therefore the sum of the axial forces in the remaining layers actual flexible riser may be tensile or compressive or null depending on the sign of f w besides the contact pressures between the internal and external thermal sheaths and the first and last flexible pipe layers are respectively equal to the internal and external pressures p i t p e t if the external or internal pressure is zero only the outer or inner thermal sheath may be introduced all loading combinations of axisymmetric nature including pure loads involving internal and external pressures and axial tension or compression may be achieved by properly calibrating the independent thermal strains of those two auxiliary thermal sheaths for illustration take only the inner thermal sheath so pure internal pressure or pure tension compression or their combination can be specified at first the isotropic material elastic modulus and poisson s ratio and thermal sheath thickness note that the thermal sheath radius is automatically defined are arbitrarily selected from equation 36 a c there are four unknown parameters i e the thickness and radius variations respectively δ t i and δ r i and two thermal strains α t i t i α z i t i furthermore in those equations p i 0 p e p i t the axial global strain δ l l is known from the mechanical analysis and the axial load f t s i j 1 n f j should be ensured the fourth algebraic equation arises from the contact continuity equation 37 because the gap between the inner thermal sheath and innermost flexible pipe layer must be equal to zero therefore the required thermal strains and thickness and radius variations may be readily calculated a schematic drawing of the internal thermal sheath and remainder actual flexible pipe with thickness and radius respectively t i t and r i r is shown in fig 2 if internal pressure and axial tensile load is simulated the flow chart for the calculation process is shown in fig 3 the values of the precisely calculated thermal strains for the inner and outer auxiliary thermally orthotropic layers may now be employed in a finite element model to achieve similarity of axisymmetric condition specially the contact pressures that govern the hysteretic stick slip behaviour during bending are enforced and a significant region of the model will be shown to experience constant curvature 3 finite element model two three dimensional finite element models mechanical and thermal are developed to simulate the axisymmetric and bending behaviours of a 6 inch rough bore flexible riser the models share most of the features such as element type mesh refinement contact interaction and material properties selection for instance in the mechanical model the internal and external pressures and the tension load are respectively applied on the inner and outermost polymeric layers and as a concentrated follower force at a reference node connected to all other nodes at the end cross sections bending loads may be applied by the rotation of this reference node but considering the presence of mechanical tension loads the curvature inexorably results variable along the model length the second model is developed as an attempt to mitigate this shortcoming by adding two auxiliary cylindrical layers internally and externally to the actual pipe structure that can respectively expand and contract radially by applying thermally induced strains to emulate the applied pressures axial tension or compression may be equally imposed in the actual flexible pipe depending on the selection of the sign of the axial thermal strains as the thermal properties are assumed orthotropic the auxiliary thermal layers are also connected to the reference end points and bending curvature response of this self supporting model is shown to be quite uniform along the model length the abaqus standard simulia 2019 package is employed and to reduce the computational cost the pressure armour is represented by an equivalent orthotropic material whose properties are calculated based on de sousa et al 2009 the resulting equivalent layer thickness is smaller than the actual tendon thickness so infill orthotropic layers gomes 2017 with negligible axial and circumferential stiffness are introduced to complete the voids typically a core using a composite layup consists of inner sheath pressure armour first anti wear tape and infill fake layers the carcass and fibre reinforced composite anti birdcage tapes are not taken into account as they do not play significant effect when the pipe is subjected to internal pressure and tension but they can be rightfully incorporated if compressive loads are investigated for the carcass layer when the pipe is subjected to axis symmetric loads due to the pressure amrour layer the radial deformation of the pipe is very small therefore ignoring the carcass does not cause significant effect on accuracy of the results the element employed for the whole model representation thermal sheath core tensile armours and outer sheath is a 4 node doubly curved shell with reduced integration and hourglass control that allows finite membrane strains s4r meanwhile this element possesses high calculation accuracy and is suitable for large deformation problems in structural analysis and simpson s integration technique with 5 points across the thickness is adopted the plastic layers pressure sheath anti wear tape and outer sheath and tensile armour layers are modelled as linear elastic isotropic materials with their properties considered temperature independent moreover the thermal sheaths are formulated as temperature independent elastic isotropic materials with orthotropic thermal expansion coefficients contact between adjacent layers plays a key role in both finite element axisymmetric and bending analyses and it is the main source of the high computational cost and numerical instability thus requiring careful selection of the tangential and normal interaction mechanisms in this sense three dimensional contact interaction is introduced between adjacent layers using a surface to surface contact algorithm for the flexible pipe the core anti wear tape and outer layer are set as master contact surfaces while the tensile armour layers are specified as slave contact surfaces the tangential behaviour within the interacting surfaces is modelled by a penalty friction formulation with elastic slip which can be viewed as the maximum relative slip displacement between contacting surfaces before full shear stress develops whereas they should be strictly stick in ideal coulomb s formulation the tangential behaviour interaction for the contact between the internal and external thermal sheaths with respectively the core and outer sheath is modelled using a rough friction formulation which means that no slip occurs once the nodes are in contact the penalty contact constraint enforcement method with a contact stiffness of 130 n mm3 is introduced for normal behaviour the finite sliding formulation is selected as the tensile armour layers may significantly slide when exposed to bending curvatures moreover the circumferential smoothing method is adopted to reduce inaccuracies in contact pressure calculation caused by mesh discretization on curved geometries the nodes in the two end sections of the model are linked using rigid body elements connected to reference points rp located at the cross section centre the rp connected to the left end rp1 of the flexible pipe model is completely constrained in all directions and rotations during the analysis the rotation around the z direction of the rp connected to the opposite end rp2 is constrained to prevent torsion while the other degrees of freedom are free in general there are two steps the first one replicates the axisymmetric loading where pressures and tension for both mechanical or thermal analyses are performed the second step aims to simulate the complex bending response of the flexible pipe besides geometric nonlinearity is activated for all load steps for the mechanical analysis internal and external pressures are directly applied on the core and outer sheath elements respectively and the total wall force is applied at rp2 as a concentrated nodal force in the z direction in the second finite element model only thermal loads are introduced on internal and external thermal sheaths by defining uniform temperature increments δ t i and δ t e respectively in all their elements for the bending analysis the rp2 is rotated around the x direction to curve the model in the y z plane fig 4 shows a schematic diagram of boundary and loading conditions 4 results and discussion in this section a case study is elaborated to analytically and numerically simulate and compare the axisymmetric response of a 6 inch flexible pipe subjected to mechanical and equivalent thermal loadings the thermal strains required to reproduce the equivalent mechanical behaviour are calculated from the analytical thermal loading formulation and used as input into the finite element model additionally a second load step is applied for both mechanical and equivalent thermal loading finite element models to assess and compare the curvature distribution the main cross section geometrical parameters for the case studies are listed in table 2 the profile of the pressure armour is simplified to a polygonal form after a flexible pipe sample s dissection and optically measurement of its shape and dimensions as shown in fig 5 the pressure armour geometrical cross section properties e g the area and lowest second moment of inertia necessary to determine its equivalent orthotropic properties are respectively computed as 52 6 mm2 and 115 8 mm4 moreover the thicknesses in the core composite layup for the inner sheath first fake shell equivalent pressure armour orthotropic shell second fake shell and anti wear tape 1 are 4 5 1 37 3 46 1 37 and 1 5 mm respectively as depicted in fig 6 the material properties for the flexible pipe models are summarized in table 3 where the pressure armour and fake shells are represented by orthotropic materials while the remaining layers are described by elastic isotropic properties for the thermal load analytical and numerical models the elastic modulus poisson s ratio and thickness of the thermal sheaths are arbitrarily and respectively specified as 20 gpa 0 3 and 5 mm a sensitive study is initially conducted to select the appropriate mesh refinement for each layer with particular attention to ensure contact uniformity resulting in a finite element model mesh for the actual flexible riser with 196 200 elements and 257 070 nodes the following number of finite elements are employed i 450 along the length in all layers ii 56 along the circumference in the outer layer anti wear tape composite layup core and thermal layers and iii 2 in each tensile armour layer width three pitches of the external armour wire are represented to eliminate the end effects and promote an almost constant curvature in the central pitch in the thermal loaded model so the total model length is 2 7 m a general view of the fem is shown in fig 7 for the thermal load analysis and the model for the mechanical analysis is identical once the internal ane external thermal sheaths are removed the contact interaction between the internal thermal sheath with corresponding flexible pipe actual layer is denoted contact 0 sequentially followed by the other interlayer interactions as shown in the same figure the results and discussions of the models developed are structured in the following order i analytical results for axisymmetric mechanical load and equivalent thermal strains required to reproduce the mechanical behaviour are shown ii results from the two finite element models with the same mechanical and thermal loads employed in the analytical models are presented to illustrate the contact pressure uniform distribution and iii the main results from analytical and finite element axisymmetric models are compared and discussed and both mechanical and thermal models are further subjected to bending loads highlighting the benefit of employing the thermal layer to simulate a nearly constant curvature when the riser is subjected to a combined tension bending loading 4 1 axisymmetric analytical models results table 4 shows the main results for the analytical mechanical model for seven simple and combined load cases including the contact pressures between the pressure sheath and pressure armour and internal tensile armour layer and the anti wear tape 1 respectively p 1 2 and p 3 4 the resulting axial forces supported by the internal and external tensile armour layers respectively f 4 and f 6 radius variations in the pressure sheath and outer sheath respectively δ r 1 and δ r 7 thickness variations in the pressure and outer sheaths respectively δ t 1 and δ t 7 and global axial strain δ l l response of the flexible pipe to the mechanical loading combination is linear as long as the contact conditions gaps status open or closed between all adjacent layers are preserved in this sense as the gap between the first and second layers is open for pure wall force p 1 2 0 the results obtained for the simultaneous application of 1 mpa internal pressure and 1 kn wall force do not strictly correspond to the sum of the loads separately applied nonetheless this inaccuracy is only relevant for the calculation of the variations of the pressure sheath radius and thickness so in general all other output variables from the model may be considered linear besides all gaps are seen to remain closed p j j 1 0 for the other load cases apart from the pure tension load condition represented by light grey colour infills all other loads in table 4 light blue colour infills result in closed contact between all adjacent layers therefore linear combination between them is rigorously obeyed for instance the output for full load combination p i t f w p e t may be represented by the sum of the responses from loads p e t p i t f w p i t f w p e t but cannot be strictly achieved with neither f w p e t p i t nor p i t f w p e t as the system of algebraic equations is linear proportional responses are obtained if loads are increased in magnitude as long as the same contact condition is preserved it is possible to determine the thermal strains for any combined mechanical load i e internal and external pressures and wall tension from table 4 as long as the same caution is taken regarding the contact gap status between adjacent layers as explained above from the contact continuity equation 37 the following relationships for the interfaces between the internal and external thermal sheaths respectively denoted by the indexes i and e and adjacent flexible pipe layers 1 and n are 42 2 δ r 1 δ t 1 2 δ r i δ t i 2 δ r n δ t n 2 δ r e δ t e note that the gaps g i 1 g e n 0 between those thermal layers and flexible pipe layers are zero i e they are always

proportionality constants related to s p i t or s p e t should be ignored the variations of axial strain thickness and radius are shown in table 4 then the thermal strains of the combined loads

p e t and p e t f w p i t where the difference is that the total wall force may be generated by the internal or external thermal sheaths moreover combining equation 47 geometrical parameters table 2 and recognizing that δ r 1 j δ t 1 j δ r n j δ t n j δ l l j in table 4 are directly proportional to the applied loads the thermal strains to be input in the finite element thermal model can be determined 4 2 axisymmetric finite element models results to test a variety of conditions and verify the applicability of the proposed equivalent thermal load methodology in the construction of finite element models that can simultaneously capture similar axisymmetric conditions and allow a constant curvature distribution along the central part of the model when bent in subsequent load step two axisymmetric load cases are initially considered in this paper as summarized in table 5 which correspond to 500 kn pure tension and 10 mpa internal pressure associated to an end cap tension force of 230 7 kn respectively denoted cases 1 and 2 once the required thermal strains are specified the finite element models for mechanical loads fm and equivalent thermal loads ft will be developed to show that similar results are achieved with both models fig 8 shows the resulting contact pressure contour plot in contact 1 analytical pressure p 3 4 in tables 4 and i e 500knx0 008892 mpa kn 4 446 mpa for both mechanical fm and thermal ft finite element models applying case 1 loading condition the results are shown for the whole pipe and in the central pitch region the contour plots of logarithmic axial strains for the outer tensile armour layer of both finite element models are shown in fig 9 it can be seen that the contact pressures and the axial strains are virtually uniform and coincident except at the model boundaries for the contact pressures and outer tensile armour wires axial strains the differences between their average values from the mechanical and thermal models for the central pitch region are respectively around 0 7 and 0 3 which are considered satisfactory 4 3 analytical versus finite element axisymmetric and bending models main results including the axial forces

respectively a or f considering mechanical and equivalent thermal models m or t and the differences between fm and analytical and between ft and analytical are respectively shown in tables 6 and 7 analytical results for the mechanical and thermal models are exactly coincident so they are uniquely called analytical in the comparison between fm and analytical models slight differences can be found in case 1 with 4 0 maximum difference for the global axial strain between the models besides the difference for the external tensile armour layer between fm and analytical model is 2 7 the differences between fm and ft are about 0 3 for all the results in case 2 larger differences are observed between fm and analytical models because of the internal pressure and poorer representation of the radial stresses in shell elements the maximum difference for the axial force in the external tensile armour layer is 4 9 besides the maximum difference for the external tensile armour layer between ft and analytical model is 5 1 the obtained results are within acceptable error limits typically encountered when comparing analytical and numerical models for this type of application which can then confirm the sufficient accuracy of both fm and ft finite element models under axisymmetric loading at last for both mechanical and thermal finite element models a bending load step is applied by rotating the reference point rp2 0 27deg around the x direction and maintaining restricted the rotation around z direction for case 1 both mechanical and thermal models are subjected to bending loads and the pipe global curvature along the longitudinal direction is calculated according to the axial engineering strains at the intrados and extrados and the inner diameter of the outer layer i e κ ε t o p ε b o t t o m d o u t e r l a y e r moreover to investigate the curvature distribution under pure internal pressure a fem subjected to pure internal pressure 10 mpa and bending loads is also developed fig 10 indicates the contour plot of logarithmic strain true strain along the longitudinal direction in the outer layer for the entire length for a rotation angle of 0 27 rad for both models the global curvature along the longitudinal direction is plotted in fig 11 for both models it can be observed that the global curvature of the middle pitch is approximately uniform for the combined thermal and bending loads whereas as expected an expressive curvature gradient is observed for the mechanical loaded model for practical engineering both finite element models can be applied according to actual working conditions 5 conclusions this paper presents a general axisymmetric analytical model for flexible pipes subjected to combined internal and external pressures and wall force in which orthotropic composite theory is proposed to describe the interlocked carcass and pressure armour and tensile armour wire and polymeric layers are respectively and conventionally modelled as helical and cylindrical isotropic elements the axisymmetric mechanical model is then extended to incorporate two auxiliary thermal layers with orthotropic thermal expansion coefficients positioned internally and externally to the actual cross section upon application of thermal gradients those layers may respectively expand and contract radially and longitudinally emulating the applied mechanical axisymmetric loads tension internal and external pressures a detailed three dimensional finite element model is established for simulating the flexible pipe response subjected to axisymmetric mechanical or thermal loads followed by the application of bending loads case studies are introduced and discussed considering the geometrical and material properties from a typical 6 inch flexible pipe both mechanical and thermal axisymmetric analytical models yield equal pipe response as they are constructed from the same fundaments the main results from the finite element models are compared within themselves and with the axisymmetric analytical mechanical and thermal models and good agreements are found the small but acceptable differences observed between the models are justified as they are developed assuming slightly different principles especially related to the misrepresentation of the radial stresses with shell elements the use of solid elements could potentially minimize this small discrepancy and this aspect deserves further investigation where accuracy versus computational cost should be assessed a nearly constant curvature is observed when the flexible pipe is subjected to combined thermal and bending loads laying the basis of a new finite element modeling approach to contribute to further studying the mechanical stick slip hysteretic bending behaviour and

20941,the calculation of stress components in tensile armour wires of flexible pipes subjected to combined tension and bending is challenging given the intrinsic geometrical and physical nonlinearities mechanical loading simulation in finite element models yields heterogeneous curvature distribution directly impacting stress evaluation addition of two auxiliary thermal layers internally and externally subjected to radial and longitudinal thermal expansions simulates equivalent axisymmetric loading achieving relatively uniform curvature distribution calculation of equivalent thermal loads and expansion coefficients involves time consuming trial and error processes by running several finite element models therefore a theoretical formulation that takes into consideration thermal sheaths with orthotropic thermal expansion coefficients and respective thermal loads is developed a three dimensional finite element model is also developed for direct application of axisymmetric mechanical or equivalent thermal loadings a 6 flexible pipe is employed in a case study to compare the finite element model results within themselves and with the analytical mechanical and thermal models the analytical results are shown to be rigorously identical the finite element models present small differences when compared to the analytical results

bearing capacity the polymeric layers including internal pressure sheath anti wear tapes and outer sheath are respectively employed to seal internal fluid reduce friction and wear between metal contacting layers and protect tensile armour layers from seawater corrosion the tensile armour layers one of the most structural crucial components concomitantly provide high tensile stiffness and low bending stiffness the precise evaluation of cyclic stresses in tensile armour layers caused by combined tension and bending loading is of paramount importance for the flexible riser fatigue life assessment accordingly the mechanical behaviour of tensile armour layers subjected to tension and bending loads is still an important research topic the current analysis methods are broadly divided into analytical and finite element methods in the first approach the axisymmetric and bending loads are treated separately and many simplifying assumptions are required whereas in the numerical modeling perspective less suppositions are usually postulated but solution entails high computational cost for analytical methods concerning axisymmetric loading analysis knapp 1979 derived a stiffness matrix for helically armoured cables based on energy theory considering the core compressibility material non linearity and large deformations witz and tan 1992 studied the mechanical behaviour of flexible pipes umbilical and marine cables under tension and torsional moment the umbilical and flexible pipe were divided into two basic components cylindrical and helical elements the analytical and experimental results for elongation versus axial load were compared and good agreement was found between them yue et al 2013 derived an analytical model to predict the tension behaviour of flexible pipes in which the effect of radial stiffness on the tension stiffness was investigated tension tests of an umbilical were carried out and there was a good agreement between analytical and experimental predictions liu and vaz 2016a derived an innovative analytical model from an equivalent linear elastic axisymmetric model by invoking the elastic viscoelastic correspondence principle to predict the axisymmetric viscoelastic response of flexible pipes subjected to axisymmetric loads in the time domain ramos and kawano 2015 made some additional contributions to the structural response of flexible pipes subjected to axisymmetric loads including the effect of both internal and external pressures in pipe displacements yan et al 2019 presented a multi scale analysis methodology to research the effective stiffnesses and local stresses of helically wound structures for bending analysis several analytical models have been proposed to predict the circumferential distribution of stresses for one tensile armour wire wound around a cylindrical toroidal surface i e the pipe is subjected to constant curvature usually prescribing that the deflected wire bent configuration may either follow loxodromic wiek 1986 skeie et al 2012 or geodesic curves féret and bournazel 1987 out 1997 additionally some scholars feret et al 1995 zhou and vaz 2017 investigated the flexible pipe behaviour subjected to combined tension and bending loading considering the friction interaction between adjacent layers however numerical analysis in this sense is required to solve the complex system of nonlinear partial differential equations as the axisymmetric response is well characterized analytically finite element methods have been mostly focused on describing the flexible pipe bending response sævik 1993 developed an eight degree of freedom curved beam element for the purpose of obtaining stresses and slips in the armour wires later sævik and bruaseth 2005 proposed a finite element formulation for predicting the complex response of umbilical cross sections subjected to loading from tension torsional moment internal and external pressures and external contact bodies to estimate stresses and displacements of an individual element as well as the overall structural response ribeiro et al 2003 introduced a three dimensional finite element model to predict the local mechanical behaviour for flexible pipes subjected to tension or compression the results are compared to those obtained with a previously reported analytical model and good agreement was found between them edmans et al 2012 developed a finite element model to describe the nonlinear behaviour of flexible pipes subjected to combined axisymmetric and bending loads malta and martins 2014 established an explicit finite element model to investigate the mechanical behaviour of flexible pipes subjected to axial compression intrinsic nonlinearities including contact clearance friction plasticity and large displacements are taken into account in the model bai et al 2015 developed analytical and 3d finite element models to investigate the mechanical behaviour of umbilical cables under tension and internal pressure and the mechanical response correlation between the numerical and theoretical models validated their applicability sousa et al de sousa and magluta 2013 studied the behaviour of flexible pipes subjected to combined tension and internal pressure by using the finite element method and good correlations were reported between fem and experimental results majed majed and cooper 2013 demonstrated an advanced method of analysis that is capable of incorporating detailed finite element models into large fully nonlinear dynamic simulations yoo et al 2017 established detailed three dimensional finite element models subjected to axial tensile and compressive loads considering material nonlinearity to investigate ultimate tensile and compressive strength failure mechanisms cornacchia et al 2019 investigated the tensile behaviour of the pipe by theoretical model and fem considering the plastic behaviour for all the layers most of the above models fail to represent a segment of flexible pipe with constant curvature in view of this shortcoming lukassen et al lyckegaard et al 2018 established a repeated unit cell finite element model ruc fem to reproduce the nonlinear bending behaviour of flexible risers subjected to combined constant tension and constant curvature reference points are connected to the nodes on the internal surface of the perfectly circular core layer with kinematic coupling constraints which makes the core rigid in the radial direction neglecting its interconnected ovalization at present three reported finite element models zhou and vaz 2017 sævik 1993 lyckegaard et al 2018 and lu et al 2020 can be used to describe the mechanical behaviour of flexible pipes subjected to axisymmetric loading and constant curvature lu et al 2020 established an alternative finite element model fem in which an equivalent thermal loading and orthotropic coefficients of thermal expansions are introduced on the external sheath to substitute a pure tension load and to ensure a uniform curvature distribution along the flexible pipe away from its ends however the equivalent thermal load and coefficient of thermal expansions are determined by fem trial and error attempts which results in larger calculation cost in addition it is more difficult to determine those values when considering the internal and external pressures therefore the main purpose of this paper is to develop an analytical rational axisymmetric model that takes into consideration the addition of internal and external thermal sheaths and their respective required thermal loads capable of mimicking the same behaviour of the mechanically loaded structure to determine the equivalent orthotropic thermal strains the main contributions are orthotropic coefficients of thermal expansions for those auxiliary layers are defined to impose the same internal and external pressures and tension or compression loads the equivalent thermal model results in the same contact pressures global deformations and axial forces from the axisymmetric mechanical analytical model based on the analytical model finite element models for both mechanically and thermally loaded structures are also developed and the results compared with the analytical models finally bending steps are added to both finite element models and curvature distributions are compared 2 axisymmetric analytical models the flexible pipe is idealized as composed of helical and cylindrical elements the tensile armour wires are regarded as helical layers and in the mathematical treatment high order small terms are neglected i e geometrical and physical nonlinearities are ignored but bending and torsional stiffness of the wires are retained the interlocked carcass and pressure layer may be equally modelled as helical layers but in the present context they are alternatively considered as orthotropic thick walled cylindrical layers and its formulation presented without any loss to the analysis the polymeric elements such as the inner pressure barrier liner anti wear tapes and external sheath can be categorized as thick walled isotropic cylindrical layers assuming small deformations and linear elastic materials the cylinder and helix deformations are shown to be directly proportional to the axisymmetric loading and the proportionality coefficients depend on the characteristic material and geometrical parameters for the cylindrical elements a thick walled elastic theory is invoked for the helical elements differential geometry concepts and love s equations are employed both layers are schematically represented in fig 1 the relationship between the axial force f torsional moment m and internal and external pressures p i and p e respectively herein named axisymmetric loading and corresponding element axisymmetric deformations δ l δ r δ t and δ θ for cylindrical and helical elements with initial length l mean radius r thickness t and twist θ 0 0 are derived for instance in liu liu and vaz 2016b the axisymmetric model construction follows initially the description of the helical element including a definition of geometrical and equilibrium equations taking into account the armour wire cross section bending and torsional stiffness the behaviour of isotropic and orthotropic cylindrical elements subjected to mechanical loading is then presented followed by the formulation development for cylindrical elements exposed to simultaneously thermal and mechanical loading in this regard the material is assumed thermally orthotropic with linear thermal expansion coefficients and mechanical properties assumed temperature independent next contact continuity conditions in the interface of the cylindrical and helical layers global equilibrium equations and the solution procedure strategy are presented 2 1 helical element modeling the analytical model for the helical elements is developed on the basis of several hypotheses regarding the regularity of the initial geometry and linearity of the response which are the wires are wound on a perfectly cylindrical surface following a cylindrical helix the wire cross section is rectangular the wires maintain a helical configuration when deformed the material is linear elastic the variations in armour wires thickness length radius and pitch angle are linear and small friction mechanisms are not taken into consideration the shear stress at the interfaces of the layers is negligible 2 1 1 geometrical equations the initial curvatures zhou and vaz 2017 tang et al 2015 in normal binormal and tangent directions respectively κ n κ b and κ i are given by 1 κ n sin 2 α r κ b 0 κ t sin α cos α r a b c where α is the helical angle in respect to its generatrix and r is defined in fig 1 the armour wire strain in the tangential direction may be shown to be related to the layer deformations δ r δ θ and δ l 2 ε t sin 2 α δ r r sin α cos α r δ θ l cos 2 α δ l l similarly the helical angle variation δ α relation to the layer deformations is 3 δ α sin α cos α δ r r cos 2 α r δ θ l sin α cos α δ l l therefore upon application of the axisymmetric loading the curvature variations in normal binormal and tangent directions δ κ n δ κ b and δ κ t may be written as 4 δ κ n sin 2 α r δ α sin 2 α r δ r r a δ κ b 0 b δ κ t cos 2 α r δ α sin α cos α r δ r r c 2 1 2 mechanical equilibrium equations the helical wires are treated as spatially curved beams supported by a cylindrical surface and the clebsch kirchhoff static differential equilibrium equations are widely employed by many authors such as love 1927 and ericksen and truesdell 1957 when using a local coordinate system the equations are developed into 5 d f t d s κ n f n κ b f b q t 0 a d f n d s κ

represent the cross section force and moment components on tangential normal and binormal directions respectively the component distributed forces and moments on tangential normal and binormal directions are respectively q t q n q b and m t m n m b and s corresponds to the arc length the bending moment components and respective curvature variations are expressed by 6 m n e i n δ κ b m b e i

polar moment of area for torsion of rectangular beams and δ κ n δ κ b and δ κ t are determined from equation 4 as friction mechanisms and shear stresses at the interfaces of the layers are not taken into consideration the transfer of forces between adjacent layers occurs only in the radial direction so q t q b m n 0 the normal tangential and torsional curvatures and the component sectional forces and moments are constant along the arc length hence their derivatives with respect to s are zero finally in view of the above particularities equation 5 are reduced to two expressions to calculate f b and q n 7 f b κ n m t κ t m b q n κ t κ n m t κ t m b κ n f t a b where κ n κ t and m t m n m b are respectively determined from equations 1 and 6 and an explicit expression for f t will be revealed later in equation 10 the tangential stress is described as the tangential force divided by the cross sectional area the compressive stress in the normal radial direction on the neutral line is approximately taken as the average of the contact pressures acting on the internal and external wire surfaces while no lateral contact is allowed therefore the stress components in the helical wire are then mathematically expressed as 8 σ t f t a σ n p i p e 2 σ b 0 a b c where a is the wire cross section area due to the axisymmetric nature of the loading applied to the flexible pipe and invoking the generalized hooke s law the strain components related to the stresses given by equations 8a c reduce to 9 ε t σ t ν σ n e f t e a ν p i p e 2 e a ε n σ n ν σ t e p i p e 2 e ν f t e a b ε

2 α δ r r sin α cos α r δ θ l cos 2 α δ l l furthermore the distributed force on the normal direction may be expressed as equal to the difference between the contact pressures on the inner and outer surfaces of the helical wire i e q n w p e p i thus equation 7 b reduces to 12 p e p i e a w r ℑ 1 δ r r r ℑ 2 δ θ l ℑ 3 δ l l a ν sin 2 α 2 w r p e p i where w is the wire width and the constants ℑ 1

z f t f b f b f t m t m b m b m t sin α δ α cos α δ α based on the moment equilibrium equation 13 combined with equations 1 6 and 7 a the relationship between the total axial force and deformations in a helical armour wires layer can be expressed by 14 f n f z n e a 1 δ r r 2 r δ θ l 3 δ l l n a ν cos α 2 p e p i where the constants 1 2 and 3 are defined as 1 cos α sin 2 α 1 sin 2 α cos 2 α i b a r

cos 2 α cos 2 α g i t e a r 2 the constants ℑ 1 ℑ 2 ℑ 3 1 2 3 ℵ 1 ℵ 2 ℵ 3 are functions of geometrical and material properties of the armour wire cross section and their impact on the axisymmetric analysis is usually small finally the mechanical behaviour of helical element axisymmetric loads f m p i p e and deformations δ l δ r δ t δ θ can be summarized and represented by equations 11 12 14 and 15 it is observed that for the helical layers the full set of deformations linearly depend on all loads described in the full set of axisymmetric loads in other words any load applied isolated trigger all set of deformations 2 2 cylindrical element modeling the analytical model for thick walled cylindrical elements subjected to axisymmetric loading assumes plane analysis and linear geometrical and physical behaviour initially the response of a thick walled isotropic elastic cylinder liu and vaz 2016b is summarized and next the formulations for the responses of the orthotropic elastic cylinder and orthotropic thermal expansion are presented herakovich 1998 2 2 1 mechanical loading 2 2 1 1 isotropic material formulation the element deformations and loads are directly proportional and are presented in liu and vaz 2016b 16 δ t t 1 ν 8 r t e 2 r t 2 p i 2 r t 2 p e 1 2 ν p i p e 4 r 2 t 2 ν δ l l a δ r r 1 ν 8 r t e 2 r t 2 p i 2 r t 2 p e 1 2 ν p i p e 4 r 2 t 2 ν δ

area observe that the deformations δ l δ r and δ t and δ θ respectively do not depend on m and f p i and p e for cylindrical elements i e the response is uncoupled 2 2 1 2 orthotropic linear material formulation ribeiro et al 2003 introduced an alternative equivalent orthotropic material to represent the carcass and pressure amour in finite element modeling given that the helical pitch angles of those layers are nearly 90 this approach may be also conveniently applied to axisymmetric analytical formulations in principal cylindrical coordinates the compliance coefficients for an orthotropic linear material can be expressed by related engineering constants herakovich 1998 thus the strain stress relationships may be written as 17 ε z ε θ ε ρ 1 e z ν θ z e θ ν ρ z e r ν z θ e z 1 e θ ν ρ θ

that can be readily calculated the strain displacement relationship for small deformations can be written as timoshenko 1951 19 ε z u z z ε θ u ρ ρ ε ρ u ρ ρ γ z ρ 0 γ z θ u θ z γ θ ρ u θ ρ u θ ρ where the longitudinal circumferential and radial displacement fields are respectively u z z u θ z ρ u ρ ρ the axial strain is constant and given by ε z δ l l thus u z z δ l l z the circumferential and radial normal strains given by equation 19 solely depend on the radial coordinate ρ the shear stress and strain τ z ρ γ z ρ are null it is assumed absence of shear stresses on both inner and outer surfaces τ θ ρ r i 0 τ θ ρ r e 0 so it can be shown that τ θ ρ and γ θ ρ are also zero the equilibrium equation in an infinitesimal element is then 20 d σ ρ d ρ σ ρ σ θ ρ 0 the relationship between the remaining shear stresses and strains with the displacement field u θ z ρ and ultimately the longitudinal and radial coordinates z and ρ is developed later invoking the first order uncoupled homogeneous linear differential equation 20 combining equations 18a 19 and 20 a second order nonhomogeneous linear differential equation for u ρ related to the radial coordinate ρ global longitudinal strain δ l l and material stiffness constants is obtained 21 d 2 u ρ d ρ 2 1 ρ d u ρ d ρ c 22 c 33 u ρ ρ 2 c 12 c 13 c 33 δ l l 1 ρ defining β c 22 c 33 the solution for equation 21 xia et al 2001 and

then the boundary conditions are expressed as 22 σ ρ r i p i σ ρ r e p e substituting equation 21 in 19 and then in 18 a and using equation 22 the integration constants d 1 and d 2 can be promptly determined those constants are then directly proportional to the internal and external pressures and global axial strain and also depend on material stiffness constants inner and outer radii for text conciseness those cumbersome constants are not explicitly shown here therefore the normal stress and strain fields are completed characterized the thickness variation may then be readily calculated from the difference between the radial displacements at the inner and external radii δ t u ρ r e u ρ r i as 23 δ t d 1 r e β r i β d 2 r e β r i β c 12 c 13 c 33 c 22 r e r i δ l l besides the radius

behaviour of orthotropic cylindrical element can be expressed by equations 23 24 28 and 28 2 2 2 thermal loading consider now a thick cylindrical element subjected to a thermal load t the thermal load represents the temperature increment relative to an initial reference temperature therefore longitudinal circumferential and radial thermal induced strains and stresses may be originated the isotropic elastic material is assumed thermally orthotropic with linear thermal expansion coefficients equal in radial and circumferential directions α t and possibly different in the longitudinal direction α z the material elastic constants e and ν are assumed temperature independent according to the classical theory of elasticity timoshenko 1951 it is assumed that the thermal load is taken to be symmetrical about the axis and independent of the axial coordinate thence the thermal induced stresses in radial and circumferential directions respectively σ ρ t and σ θ t subjected to thermal load may vary through the thickness and are respectively given by 29 σ ρ t e α t 1 ν ρ 2 ρ 2 r i 2 r e 2 r i 2 r i r e t ρ d ρ r i ρ t ρ d ρ σ θ t e α t 1 ν ρ 2 ρ 2 r i 2 r e 2 r i 2 r i r e t ρ d ρ r i ρ

reads for the cylinder cross sectional area 2 3 contact continuity assume a flexible pipe consisting of n layers n h of which are polymeric cylindrical layers the gap between adjacent layers is denoted g j j 1 then the relationship between the thickness and radius variations in adjacent layers j and j 1 translates to 37 δ r j 1 δ r j δ t j δ t j 1 2 g j j 1 j 1 2 n 1 the gap g j j 1 may be either closed or open respectively expressed as g j j 1 0 or g j j 1 0 the continuity of the contact pressure between adjacent layers depends on the gap value as follows a no gap between adjacent layers g j j 1 0 the relationship of contact pressure between adjacent layers is 38 p e j p i j 1 p j j 1 j 1 2 n 1 p e n p e t p i 1 p i t where p e j and p i j 1 respectively correspond to the external and internal pressures of the j th and j 1 th layer j 1 and j n respectively correspond to the inner and outer layers and p e t p i t are respectively the flexible pipe external hydrostatic and internal pressures b gap between adjacent layers g j j 1 0 the corresponding contact pressure between j th and j 1 th layer is then zero the continuity of contact pressure between adjacent layers can be expressed as 39 p e j p i j 1 0 p e n p e t p i 1 p i t it can be observed that the contact pressure p j j 1 and gap g j j 1 cannot be simultaneously the unknown parameters i e when one is unknown the other one must be equal to zero 2 4 global equilibrium the sum of the axial forces and torsional moments acting on each layer are respectively equal to the total wall force f w and torsional moment m t therefore the axial force equilibrium equation and torsional moment for a flexible pipe are given by 40 j 1 n f j f e π p i t r i t 2 π p e t r e t 2 f w f o r i m e c h a n i c a l l o a d f t s i f t s e j 1 n f j f w f o r i i t h e r m a l l o a d 41 j 1 n m j m t where f j are calculated from equation 14 for the helical layers and equation 16 c and 28 respectively for isotropic and orthotropic cylindrical layers subjected to mechanical loads the effective and true wall tensions are respectively f e f w and are related in equation 42 a and f t s i f t s e are calculated from equation 36 c and respectively mean the axial load in the internal and external thermal sheaths the external and internal flexible pipe radii carcass disregarded are respectively r e t r i t similarly the torsional moments m j are respectively calculated in equations 15 and 16 d 28 and 36 d for helical layers isotropic orthotropic and thermal cylindrical layers equation 42 b implies that the sum of the thermal loads in inner and outer thermal sheaths leads to the same magnitude of the specified wall tension but in opposite direction consequently the total force in the structure actual flexible pipe layers plus the two thermal loads is zero 2 5 solution procedure for the flexible riser the axial and torsional strains respectively δ l l and δ θ l must be the same for each layer to calculate the equivalent thermal strains that mimic the axisymmetric model two steps based on different load conditions i e mechanical and thermal loads are discussed 2 5 1 mechanical load at first the mechanical loads comprised of axial wall force f w torque moment m t and external and internal pressures p e t and p i t may be applied isolated or combined to predict the two global deformations δ l l δ θ l n 1 local interlayer contact pressures or gaps between adjacent layers n axial forces and n torque moments in each one of the layers for example besides there are 2 n unknown parameters for radius and thickness variations for the n layers therefore the total number of unknown variables is 5 n 1 as shown in table 1 the corresponding number of algebraic equations is also 5n 1 there are four equilibrium equations for each layer 4n as summarized above besides the number of contact compatibility relationships between thickness and radius variations is n 1 as introduced in equation 37 the sum of forces and moments are respectively shown in equations 40 and 41 as the gap between the layers g j j 1 maybe zero or positive depending on the loading combination at the beginning of the calculation all gaps are designated to be zero after solving the system of equations the contact pressures are checked and if a certain contact pressure p j j 1 is negative then the contact pressure is assigned a zero value and gap becomes the unknown variable and is calculated this process is repeated until all contact pressures are not negative and the calculation process finishes with the parameters considered correctly calculated 2 5 2 thermal load in the next step the required thermal strains that impose the same behaviour in the flexible pipe layers as the mechanically loaded structure are calculated in this case two additional thermal sheaths with orthotropic thermal expansion coefficients are introduced one just above the flexible pipe outer sheath named e and another one inside the flexible pipe named i they are respectively responsible to produce external and internal pressures and axial loads may be originated from any of them their respective equivalent thermal loads t i t e and associated thermal strains α t i t i α z i t i and α t e t e α z e t e are only applied on the thermal sheaths it may be specified without loss of generality that the axial force in a certain thermal sheath is equal to zero by appropriately calculating the required value for the axial thermal strain the total resulting force in the thermal sheaths should then be equal to f w i e f t s i f t s e j 1 n f j where either f t s i f t s e may be zero therefore the sum of the axial forces in the remaining layers actual flexible riser may be tensile or compressive or null depending on the sign of f w besides the contact pressures between the internal and external thermal sheaths and the first and last flexible pipe layers are respectively equal to the internal and external pressures p i t p e t if the external or internal pressure is zero only the outer or inner thermal sheath may be introduced all loading combinations of axisymmetric nature including pure loads involving internal and external pressures and axial tension or compression may be achieved by properly calibrating the independent thermal strains of those two auxiliary thermal sheaths for illustration take only the inner thermal sheath so pure internal pressure or pure tension compression or their combination can be specified at first the isotropic material elastic modulus and poisson s ratio and thermal sheath thickness note that the thermal sheath radius is automatically defined are arbitrarily selected from equation 36 a c there are four unknown parameters i e the thickness and radius variations respectively δ t i and δ r i and two thermal strains α t i t i α z i t i furthermore in those equations p i 0 p e p i t the axial global strain δ l l is known from the mechanical analysis and the axial load f t s i j 1 n f j should be ensured the fourth algebraic equation arises from the contact continuity equation 37 because the gap between the inner thermal sheath and innermost flexible pipe layer must be equal to zero therefore the required thermal strains and thickness and radius variations may be readily calculated a schematic drawing of the internal thermal sheath and remainder actual flexible pipe with thickness and radius respectively t i t and r i r is shown in fig 2 if internal pressure and axial tensile load is simulated the flow chart for the calculation process is shown in fig 3 the values of the precisely calculated thermal strains for the inner and outer auxiliary thermally orthotropic layers may now be employed in a finite element model to achieve similarity of axisymmetric condition specially the contact pressures that govern the hysteretic stick slip behaviour during bending are enforced and a significant region of the model will be shown to experience constant curvature 3 finite element model two three dimensional finite element models mechanical and thermal are developed to simulate the axisymmetric and bending behaviours of a 6 inch rough bore flexible riser the models share most of the features such as element type mesh refinement contact interaction and material properties selection for instance in the mechanical model the internal and external pressures and the tension load are respectively applied on the inner and outermost polymeric layers and as a concentrated follower force at a reference node connected to all other nodes at the end cross sections bending loads may be applied by the rotation of this reference node but considering the presence of mechanical tension loads the curvature inexorably results variable along the model length the second model is developed as an attempt to mitigate this shortcoming by adding two auxiliary cylindrical layers internally and externally to the actual pipe structure that can respectively expand and contract radially by applying thermally induced strains to emulate the applied pressures axial tension or compression may be equally imposed in the actual flexible pipe depending on the selection of the sign of the axial thermal strains as the thermal properties are assumed orthotropic the auxiliary thermal layers are also connected to the reference end points and bending curvature response of this self supporting model is shown to be quite uniform along the model length the abaqus standard simulia 2019 package is employed and to reduce the computational cost the pressure armour is represented by an equivalent orthotropic material whose properties are calculated based on de sousa et al 2009 the resulting equivalent layer thickness is smaller than the actual tendon thickness so infill orthotropic layers gomes 2017 with negligible axial and circumferential stiffness are introduced to complete the voids typically a core using a composite layup consists of inner sheath pressure armour first anti wear tape and infill fake layers the carcass and fibre reinforced composite anti birdcage tapes are not taken into account as they do not play significant effect when the pipe is subjected to internal pressure and tension but they can be rightfully incorporated if compressive loads are investigated for the carcass layer when the pipe is subjected to axis symmetric loads due to the pressure amrour layer the radial deformation of the pipe is very small therefore ignoring the carcass does not cause significant effect on accuracy of the results the element employed for the whole model representation thermal sheath core tensile armours and outer sheath is a 4 node doubly curved shell with reduced integration and hourglass control that allows finite membrane strains s4r meanwhile this element possesses high calculation accuracy and is suitable for large deformation problems in structural analysis and simpson s integration technique with 5 points across the thickness is adopted the plastic layers pressure sheath anti wear tape and outer sheath and tensile armour layers are modelled as linear elastic isotropic materials with their properties considered temperature independent moreover the thermal sheaths are formulated as temperature independent elastic isotropic materials with orthotropic thermal expansion coefficients contact between adjacent layers plays a key role in both finite element axisymmetric and bending analyses and it is the main source of the high computational cost and numerical instability thus requiring careful selection of the tangential and normal interaction mechanisms in this sense three dimensional contact interaction is introduced between adjacent layers using a surface to surface contact algorithm for the flexible pipe the core anti wear tape and outer layer are set as master contact surfaces while the tensile armour layers are specified as slave contact surfaces the tangential behaviour within the interacting surfaces is modelled by a penalty friction formulation with elastic slip which can be viewed as the maximum relative slip displacement between contacting surfaces before full shear stress develops whereas they should be strictly stick in ideal coulomb s formulation the tangential behaviour interaction for the contact between the internal and external thermal sheaths with respectively the core and outer sheath is modelled using a rough friction formulation which means that no slip occurs once the nodes are in contact the penalty contact constraint enforcement method with a contact stiffness of 130 n mm3 is introduced for normal behaviour the finite sliding formulation is selected as the tensile armour layers may significantly slide when exposed to bending curvatures moreover the circumferential smoothing method is adopted to reduce inaccuracies in contact pressure calculation caused by mesh discretization on curved geometries the nodes in the two end sections of the model are linked using rigid body elements connected to reference points rp located at the cross section centre the rp connected to the left end rp1 of the flexible pipe model is completely constrained in all directions and rotations during the analysis the rotation around the z direction of the rp connected to the opposite end rp2 is constrained to prevent torsion while the other degrees of freedom are free in general there are two steps the first one replicates the axisymmetric loading where pressures and tension for both mechanical or thermal analyses are performed the second step aims to simulate the complex bending response of the flexible pipe besides geometric nonlinearity is activated for all load steps for the mechanical analysis internal and external pressures are directly applied on the core and outer sheath elements respectively and the total wall force is applied at rp2 as a concentrated nodal force in the z direction in the second finite element model only thermal loads are introduced on internal and external thermal sheaths by defining uniform temperature increments δ t i and δ t e respectively in all their elements for the bending analysis the rp2 is rotated around the x direction to curve the model in the y z plane fig 4 shows a schematic diagram of boundary and loading conditions 4 results and discussion in this section a case study is elaborated to analytically and numerically simulate and compare the axisymmetric response of a 6 inch flexible pipe subjected to mechanical and equivalent thermal loadings the thermal strains required to reproduce the equivalent mechanical behaviour are calculated from the analytical thermal loading formulation and used as input into the finite element model additionally a second load step is applied for both mechanical and equivalent thermal loading finite element models to assess and compare the curvature distribution the main cross section geometrical parameters for the case studies are listed in table 2 the profile of the pressure armour is simplified to a polygonal form after a flexible pipe sample s dissection and optically measurement of its shape and dimensions as shown in fig 5 the pressure armour geometrical cross section properties e g the area and lowest second moment of inertia necessary to determine its equivalent orthotropic properties are respectively computed as 52 6 mm2 and 115 8 mm4 moreover the thicknesses in the core composite layup for the inner sheath first fake shell equivalent pressure armour orthotropic shell second fake shell and anti wear tape 1 are 4 5 1 37 3 46 1 37 and 1 5 mm respectively as depicted in fig 6 the material properties for the flexible pipe models are summarized in table 3 where the pressure armour and fake shells are represented by orthotropic materials while the remaining layers are described by elastic isotropic properties for the thermal load analytical and numerical models the elastic modulus poisson s ratio and thickness of the thermal sheaths are arbitrarily and respectively specified as 20 gpa 0 3 and 5 mm a sensitive study is initially conducted to select the appropriate mesh refinement for each layer with particular attention to ensure contact uniformity resulting in a finite element model mesh for the actual flexible riser with 196 200 elements and 257 070 nodes the following number of finite elements are employed i 450 along the length in all layers ii 56 along the circumference in the outer layer anti wear tape composite layup core and thermal layers and iii 2 in each tensile armour layer width three pitches of the external armour wire are represented to eliminate the end effects and promote an almost constant curvature in the central pitch in the thermal loaded model so the total model length is 2 7 m a general view of the fem is shown in fig 7 for the thermal load analysis and the model for the mechanical analysis is identical once the internal ane external thermal sheaths are removed the contact interaction between the internal thermal sheath with corresponding flexible pipe actual layer is denoted contact 0 sequentially followed by the other interlayer interactions as shown in the same figure the results and discussions of the models developed are structured in the following order i analytical results for axisymmetric mechanical load and equivalent thermal strains required to reproduce the mechanical behaviour are shown ii results from the two finite element models with the same mechanical and thermal loads employed in the analytical models are presented to illustrate the contact pressure uniform distribution and iii the main results from analytical and finite element axisymmetric models are compared and discussed and both mechanical and thermal models are further subjected to bending loads highlighting the benefit of employing the thermal layer to simulate a nearly constant curvature when the riser is subjected to a combined tension bending loading 4 1 axisymmetric analytical models results table 4 shows the main results for the analytical mechanical model for seven simple and combined load cases including the contact pressures between the pressure sheath and pressure armour and internal tensile armour layer and the anti wear tape 1 respectively p 1 2 and p 3 4 the resulting axial forces supported by the internal and external tensile armour layers respectively f 4 and f 6 radius variations in the pressure sheath and outer sheath respectively δ r 1 and δ r 7 thickness variations in the pressure and outer sheaths respectively δ t 1 and δ t 7 and global axial strain δ l l response of the flexible pipe to the mechanical loading combination is linear as long as the contact conditions gaps status open or closed between all adjacent layers are preserved in this sense as the gap between the first and second layers is open for pure wall force p 1 2 0 the results obtained for the simultaneous application of 1 mpa internal pressure and 1 kn wall force do not strictly correspond to the sum of the loads separately applied nonetheless this inaccuracy is only relevant for the calculation of the variations of the pressure sheath radius and thickness so in general all other output variables from the model may be considered linear besides all gaps are seen to remain closed p j j 1 0 for the other load cases apart from the pure tension load condition represented by light grey colour infills all other loads in table 4 light blue colour infills result in closed contact between all adjacent layers therefore linear combination between them is rigorously obeyed for instance the output for full load combination p i t f w p e t may be represented by the sum of the responses from loads p e t p i t f w p i t f w p e t but cannot be strictly achieved with neither f w p e t p i t nor p i t f w p e t as the system of algebraic equations is linear proportional responses are obtained if loads are increased in magnitude as long as the same contact condition is preserved it is possible to determine the thermal strains for any combined mechanical load i e internal and external pressures and wall tension from table 4 as long as the same caution is taken regarding the contact gap status between adjacent layers as explained above from the contact continuity equation 37 the following relationships for the interfaces between the internal and external thermal sheaths respectively denoted by the indexes i and e and adjacent flexible pipe layers 1 and n are 42 2 δ r 1 δ t 1 2 δ r i δ t i 2 δ r n δ t n 2 δ r e δ t e note that the gaps g i 1 g e n 0 between those thermal layers and flexible pipe layers are zero i e they are always

known from the mechanical analysis and imposed loads and f t s i and f t s e are related in equation 42b as there are 6 unknowns and 5 equations it is needed to specify one of the thermal sheath forces if any value for either f t s i or f t s e is assumed zero for instance the four thermal strains and remaining thermal sheath force may be calculated it is assumed that the pipe is subjected to p i t p i t mpa f w f w kn and p e t p e t mpa note that the magnitudes of deformations δ r 1 δ t 1 δ r n δ t n δ l l are themselves linearly dependent on the loads p i t f w p e t assuming contact

proportionality constants related to s p i t or s p e t should be ignored the variations of axial strain thickness and radius are shown in table 4 then the thermal strains of the combined loads

p e t and p e t f w p i t where the difference is that the total wall force may be generated by the internal or external thermal sheaths moreover combining equation 47 geometrical parameters table 2 and recognizing that δ r 1 j δ t 1 j δ r n j δ t n j δ l l j in table 4 are directly proportional to the applied loads the thermal strains to be input in the finite element thermal model can be determined 4 2 axisymmetric finite element models results to test a variety of conditions and verify the applicability of the proposed equivalent thermal load methodology in the construction of finite element models that can simultaneously capture similar axisymmetric conditions and allow a constant curvature distribution along the central part of the model when bent in subsequent load step two axisymmetric load cases are initially considered in this paper as summarized in table 5 which correspond to 500 kn pure tension and 10 mpa internal pressure associated to an end cap tension force of 230 7 kn respectively denoted cases 1 and 2 once the required thermal strains are specified the finite element models for mechanical loads fm and equivalent thermal loads ft will be developed to show that similar results are achieved with both models fig 8 shows the resulting contact pressure contour plot in contact 1 analytical pressure p 3 4 in tables 4 and i e 500knx0 008892 mpa kn 4 446 mpa for both mechanical fm and thermal ft finite element models applying case 1 loading condition the results are shown for the whole pipe and in the central pitch region the contour plots of logarithmic axial strains for the outer tensile armour layer of both finite element models are shown in fig 9 it can be seen that the contact pressures and the axial strains are virtually uniform and coincident except at the model boundaries for the contact pressures and outer tensile armour wires axial strains the differences between their average values from the mechanical and thermal models for the central pitch region are respectively around 0 7 and 0 3 which are considered satisfactory 4 3 analytical versus finite element axisymmetric and bending models main results including the axial forces

respectively a or f considering mechanical and equivalent thermal models m or t and the differences between fm and analytical and between ft and analytical are respectively shown in tables 6 and 7 analytical results for the mechanical and thermal models are exactly coincident so they are uniquely called analytical in the comparison between fm and analytical models slight differences can be found in case 1 with 4 0 maximum difference for the global axial strain between the models besides the difference for the external tensile armour layer between fm and analytical model is 2 7 the differences between fm and ft are about 0 3 for all the results in case 2 larger differences are observed between fm and analytical models because of the internal pressure and poorer representation of the radial stresses in shell elements the maximum difference for the axial force in the external tensile armour layer is 4 9 besides the maximum difference for the external tensile armour layer between ft and analytical model is 5 1 the obtained results are within acceptable error limits typically encountered when comparing analytical and numerical models for this type of application which can then confirm the sufficient accuracy of both fm and ft finite element models under axisymmetric loading at last for both mechanical and thermal finite element models a bending load step is applied by rotating the reference point rp2 0 27deg around the x direction and maintaining restricted the rotation around z direction for case 1 both mechanical and thermal models are subjected to bending loads and the pipe global curvature along the longitudinal direction is calculated according to the axial engineering strains at the intrados and extrados and the inner diameter of the outer layer i e κ ε t o p ε b o t t o m d o u t e r l a y e r moreover to investigate the curvature distribution under pure internal pressure a fem subjected to pure internal pressure 10 mpa and bending loads is also developed fig 10 indicates the contour plot of logarithmic strain true strain along the longitudinal direction in the outer layer for the entire length for a rotation angle of 0 27 rad for both models the global curvature along the longitudinal direction is plotted in fig 11 for both models it can be observed that the global curvature of the middle pitch is approximately uniform for the combined thermal and bending loads whereas as expected an expressive curvature gradient is observed for the mechanical loaded model for practical engineering both finite element models can be applied according to actual working conditions 5 conclusions this paper presents a general axisymmetric analytical model for flexible pipes subjected to combined internal and external pressures and wall force in which orthotropic composite theory is proposed to describe the interlocked carcass and pressure armour and tensile armour wire and polymeric layers are respectively and conventionally modelled as helical and cylindrical isotropic elements the axisymmetric mechanical model is then extended to incorporate two auxiliary thermal layers with orthotropic thermal expansion coefficients positioned internally and externally to the actual cross section upon application of thermal gradients those layers may respectively expand and contract radially and longitudinally emulating the applied mechanical axisymmetric loads tension internal and external pressures a detailed three dimensional finite element model is established for simulating the flexible pipe response subjected to axisymmetric mechanical or thermal loads followed by the application of bending loads case studies are introduced and discussed considering the geometrical and material properties from a typical 6 inch flexible pipe both mechanical and thermal axisymmetric analytical models yield equal pipe response as they are constructed from the same fundaments the main results from the finite element models are compared within themselves and with the axisymmetric analytical mechanical and thermal models and good agreements are found the small but acceptable differences observed between the models are justified as they are developed assuming slightly different principles especially related to the misrepresentation of the radial stresses with shell elements the use of solid elements could potentially minimize this small discrepancy and this aspect deserves further investigation where accuracy versus computational cost should be assessed a nearly constant curvature is observed when the flexible pipe is subjected to combined thermal and bending loads laying the basis of a new finite element modeling approach to contribute to further studying the mechanical stick slip hysteretic bending behaviour and

20942,the utilization of rov remotely operated vehicle for subsea operation has been increasing in the past few years alongside the increasing use of subsea technologies in deep water oil and gas activities and other maritime operations while survey class rovs have reached the deepest depth in the ocean the work class rovs are mostly limited to 3 km depth for a work class rov operating in deep waters the excessive static tension due to self weight of the rov and its umbilical system leaves small room before the dynamic tension exceeds the safe working load of the umbilical snap loads can also exist in the low tension area of the umbilical when the rov system is under dynamic motions which can lead to a large tensile load in the line therefore there is a need for a practical solution to ensure that the safe working load is not exceeded during ultra deep water operation this study focuses in reducing the tension in the umbilical hence increasing the operational depth of a work class rov from deep to ultra deep waters three different configurations namely the hook hook top floaters and mid depth hook are numerically investigated and compared with the conventional free flying rov configuration firstly deep water operation of a 3 km rov system is simulated under combination of a real extreme vertical current profile and various irregular wave conditions this shows negligible effect of the current profile on umbilical maximum tension the study also shows that for 3 km rov operation the suggested hook configuration is sufficient to effectively reduce the tension load as well as reducing the possibility of snap in the umbilical using hook configuration in the umbilical has significant benefits in minimizing rov motion and also filters out the destructive snap induced high frequency tension fluctuations in the umbilical for 6 km operation either hook top floaters or mid depth hook can be utilized whereas the mid depth hook configuration provides a broader environmental operating window for rov operation however installation of floaters on the umbilical to produce the mid depth hook configuration increases the rov offset keywords rov operation deep water umbilical cable float 1 introduction the moonshot target to reach the deepest part of the ocean using an rov remotely operated vehicle is an interesting story that has been started since 1953 wernli sr 1999 based on the history sending an rov to an ultra deep water location is a challenging task where the mass of the vehicle and the umbilical the cable connecting the rov to the surface facility should be reduced to ensure that the safe working load swl of the umbilical is not exceeded conventionally the umbilical comes in the form of steel armored cable which usually comprises of fiber optics and electrical conductors wernli sr and christ 2014 to reduce the mass of the cable kaiko momma et al 2004 and abismo ishibashi et al 2008 substituted the steel armored cable with kevlar cable where its strength to weight ratio is relatively larger than the conventional steel armored cable however kevlar cable is expensive and has limited lifetimes moreover due to its low density and relatively large cross sectional area the diameter is up to 40 mm for kaiko the kevlar cable experiences a large drag which makes it easier to drift under the action of the ocean current and hence difficult to move the rov horizontally andrew d bowen et al 2004 considering the drawbacks of the kevlar cable nereus a d bowen et al 2009 took the concept of self powered vehicle allowing them to eliminate the electrical conductors from the umbilical as a result the umbilical for nereus was an unarmored lightweight fiber optic with a small diameter only up to 1 mm in addition since the vehicle was self powered the umbilical could be detached from the vehicle transforming the vehicle from rov to auv automated unmanned vehicle hence it was called the hybrid rov lately a combination of kevlar cable up to 7 000 m depth and fiber optic from 7 000 m to 11 000 m depth is under preparation for urov11k nakajoh et al 2018 even though reducing the vehicle and umbilical mass allows the rov to reach deeper locations it also reduces the capabilities of the rov during its deep water operation if in the past the operator was satisfied with sending the rov to the seabed take several seabed samples or pictures and then recover the rov current offshore operations require the rov to do more complicated and heavy activities at greater depth within a longer time window to achieve this more power should be distributed by the umbilical and more complex and heavier equipment should be installed on the rov back in 1999 four years after kaiko reached the deepest point in the ocean there were approximately 500 commercial work class rovs however none of them could operate deeper than 3 000 m wernli sr 1999 in a recent project a steel armored umbilical with fairly small outside diameter was utilized to operate their 4 500 volt work class rov down to 6 000 m depth jaycen 2017 the team utilized an electric controller which allowed them to use fewer conductors resulting a tiny umbilical as small as 17 mm diameter though the diameter is not as small as the unarmored lightweight fiber optic utilized in nereus the reduced umbilical diameter still absorbs less environmental load and has less total self weight compared to the conventional steel armored umbilical to gain further reduction in the total weight the team removed tms tether management system from the rov set up jaycen 2017 however not all work class rovs utilize an electric controller system some rov manufacturers prefer a combination of electric and hydraulic system for their rov instrumentation though small reduction to the conventional umbilical mass and diameter can be achieved for the hydro electric instrumentation this system still leads to a large umbilical diameter combination of wave and ship motion produces significant motions on the rov which amplifies the tension in the umbilical driscoll et al 2000b in the extreme case vertical motion of the rov leads to a snap phenomenon where there is a sudden transition between slack and taut condition in the umbilical when snap occurs series of corresponding spikes are generated in response time history of the umbilical tension where their magnitudes can greatly exceed the safe working load of the line driscoll et al 2000b 2000c one way to avoid snap load during the rov operation is by using heave compensator as shown by driscoll et al 2000 main aim of this study is to find alternative configurations for minimizing the tension in the umbilical not to exceed the safe working load of the line for deep and ultra deep water operation of a work class rov the rov umbilical and environmental data in this study are based on outcomes of the crcp research grant 2017 in engineering design and manufacturing of a new work class rov for operation in ultra deep waters all input data and operational assumptions are given by the rov manufacturer and operator the focus of the research is to test the usage of floaters also known as cable floats to eliminate or reduce the snap load from the system three different innovative configurations namely the hook hook top floaters and mid depth hook are stochastically investigated and compared with the conventional free flying rov configuration the study is carried out for a 6 000 m depth rated work class rov with steel armored umbilical for operation in different water depths 2 umbilical rov configuration 2 1 conventional configuration of deep water rov conventionally a deep water rov system consists of five main components surface vessel umbilical tms tether and rov vessel the control room for piloting the rov together with a launch and recovery system lars to deploy and recover the rov are located at the surface vessel an armored cable called umbilical transmits power and signal from surface vessel to tms the power and signal are then continued from tms to rov by unarmored cable known as tether wernli sr and christ 2014 a schematic view of a conventional rov system is presented in fig 1 in principle tms acts as a heavy item to reduce the rov offset due to current and wave loads during deep water operation tms also acts as a counterweight to reduce risk of snap load when the rov pass through the splash zone during launch and recovery phase for rov operation in deep and ultra deep waters where total self weight of the umbilical and the rov in water is close to swl of the line elimination of the tms and tether is a reasonable alternative to reduce maximum tensile force in the line four main different configurations for direct connection of the rov to the surface vessel as shown in fig 2 are studied in this research straight hook hook top floaters and mid depth hook 2 2 straight configuration straight configuration is the simplest configuration considered in this study which also acts as the benchmark to measure how well the other configurations can reduce the tension in the umbilical in this configuration the rov is hanging freely and the umbilical connects the rov directly to the surface vessel without any wave and current load the umbilical is in a straight vertical shape with linearly decreasing static tension from the vessel connection point to the rov connection point the possibility of snap occurrence in the line around rov connection point is high due to its low static tension straight configuration is illustrated in fig 2a 2 3 hook configuration the hook configuration presented in fig 2b is one way to decouple the rov motion from the surface vessel motion reducing the possibility of snap occurrence in this case a vertical upward force is applied on the rov or on the umbilical around the rov connection which counterbalances the submerged weights of the rov and a short part of the umbilical this upward force creates zero tension condition at a point on the umbilical around rov connection namely zero tension point from structural response perspective this splits the umbilical into top and bottom parts where the top part is supported by the surface vessel and the bottom part is supported by the applied vertical load in reality the vertical force may be generated by an upward rov thrust a positive buoyancy force from the rov or by some additional floaters attached to the umbilical close to rov connection the success of this configuration in decoupling the rov and surface vessel motions lies on the ability of the upward force to create the zero tension point along the umbilical 2 4 hook top floaters configuration during rov operation in deep water the static tension at the upper part of the umbilical can be close to its swl the combination of dynamic and static tension may exceed the swl even when the snap has been eliminated by the hook configuration in this case the rov should only be operated in a relatively calm sea to reduce the dynamic tension which limits the operating window of the rov the static tension can be reduced by installing a series of floaters along the umbilical since large tension naturally exists at the top part of the umbilical it is logical to install the floaters at this high risk area of exceeding swl the success of this configuration lies on the ability of the system to ensure that the static tension around the floaters is well below swl of the umbilical and still far enough from zero tension if the static tension is too close to swl the total tension in the line may exceed the swl due to dynamic effects if the static tension is too close to zero then the umbilical may experience large snap loads which also means the possibility of swl exceedance the location and number of the floaters can be optimized to produce an effective hook and top floater configuration however the minimum number of floaters that should be installed strongly depends on the target operational environment harsher environment induces larger dynamic tension in the line requiring larger number of floaters to be installed on the umbilical fig 2c shows a general view of the hook and top floaters configuration 2 5 mid depth hook configuration this configuration is similar to the hook configuration with the exception that the individual floaters are installed far from the rov as typically shown in fig 2d in this case the zero tension point occurs around the floaters in the mid depth hook configuration since the submerged weight of a long umbilical segment should be taken by the floaters the amount of additional buoyancy to be provided by the floaters is much bigger than that one required in the hook configuration however by installing more floaters around the mid depth of the umbilical it will not only decouple the rov motion from the vessel motion similar to the hook configuration but also reduces the static tension in the top part of the umbilical similar to hook and top floaters configuration as a result the rov can be operated under more severe environmental conditions 3 numerical model 3 1 umbilical and rov model various methods have been developed to model the structural response of flexible structures under wave and current loads in general there are three main categories finite difference model ablow and schechter 1983 gobat and grosenbaugh 2006 grosenbaugh et al 1993 2007 howell 1991 finite element model delmer et al 1988 ketchman and lou 1975 mcnamara et al 1988 quan et al 2016 and lumped mass model bradley j buckham et al 2003 b j buckham and nahon 2001 driscoll et al 2000a huang and vassalos 1993 niedzwecki and thampi 1988 in this study the umbilical is modelled using the lmm in orcaflex orcina 2019 the element sizes are varied from a coarse mesh gradually decrease from 10m 5m 2 5m and 1m segment lengths at the upper and middle part of the umbilical to a fine mesh 30 cm segment length at the bottom part of the umbilical the fine mesh is only employed to model the bottom part of the umbilical since this part has low static tension making it more prone to large lateral motions and or slack conditions the line element is also restricted from experiencing any compression above the euler buckling load of the line segment see orcina 2019 for further information making the line model able to represent slack condition numerically the rov is defined as a 3d buoy with three translational dofs degrees of freedom the ship motions are considered in all simulations and modelled by defining the rao of the ship in 6 dofs and the rov is assumed to be deployed from starboard side of a medium size surface vessel with length of 103 m and displacement of 9 000 tones torsion stiffness of the umbilical is neglected and its swl is 70 kn the time interval for implicit integration is set to 0 01s to ensure a stable implicit integration during the occurrence of snap the rov model and umbilical specifications are presented in table 1 and general view of the model in shown in fig 3 3 2 environmental condition in this study the wave is represented by a jonswap spectrum dnv 2019 as per imca international marine contractors association rovs may be required to operate under wave environment with maximum significant wave height hs between 2 5 and 6 0 m and wave period of 8 10 s imca 2013 considering the project requirements for the rov operation in this study and the suggested validity range of the jonswap spectrum dnv 2019 only several combinations of significant wave height hs and spectral peak period tp are included in the numerical simulations as presented in table 2 for structural analysis of rov umbilical during deep water operation appropriate vertical current profile is also required to achieve accurate response of the system lubis et al 2020 investigated the extreme current profile for deep water operation of the same umbilical rov system as this study at a location with 3 6 km depth in the gulf of mexico the results as presented in fig 4 are utilized in this study two different water depths of 3 and 6 km are analyzed in this study for the case of 3 km water depth the current profile is interpolated and then tapered at 3 km water depth and the rov system is simulated under combination of the extreme current various wave states and the vessel motions the result of 3 km study is then considered during the preparation of 6 km simulation 4 estimating the maximum tension 4 1 stochastic approach in estimating maximum tension due to the random nature of ocean waves the maximum tension on the umbilical should be determined under various realizations of ocean surface for ocean structures in general the extreme response is commonly predicted by performing statistical analysis on the structural response under n number of 3 hour ocean wave realizations since the irregular wave can be considered as a stationary process for 3 hours dnv 2019 a statistical analysis can then be performed by fitting a distribution such as gumbel distribution stanisic et al 2018 to n sample of maximum responses the value of n should be large to ensure a small error in the statistical analysis however n is commonly set in the range of 10 30 in conventional engineering practice due to computational limitations stanisic et al 2018 showed that 30 40 simulations were required when analyzing a strongly nonlinear and dynamically sensitive system since n is set as a finite number an error measure to the maximum tension on the umbilical should be established in this case similar to bootstrapping methodology presented by haver and winterstein 2008 the parametric bootstrap framework is chosen to determine the error of the maximum tension in a stochastic approach in the performed parametric bootstrap n number of maximum tensions x referred as original dataset are taken from n 3 hour simulations are fitted to gumbel distribution f x through method of moment after that n number of new maximum tensions x referred as synthesis dataset are generated using f x through monte carlo simulation then a new gumbel distribution f x is fitted into the synthesis dataset the monte carlo procedure is repeated 10 000 times producing 10 000 different f x with different 95 percentile values sorting the 10 000 samples of the 95 percentile value produces another empirical cumulative distribution function referred here as the cdf of initial maximum tension then the 95 percentile value of the cdf of initial maximum tension is taken as the final maximum tension xf or maximum tension to make it simply referred equations 1 and 7 shows the fitted gumbel cdf from the original and synthetic data respectively fig 5 presents the flowchart of the bootstrapping process as implemented in

between 0 and 1 4 2 estimating minimum number of wave realizations the minimum number of ocean surface realizations n for time history analysis of structural systems under randomly generated waves varies for different offshore systems a brief study is carried out here to determine n for deep water rov operation a 3 km rov operation with the straight configuration is analyzed under a combination of the extreme vertical current profile and an irregular wave with hs 5 m and tp 8 s the fine mesh and small time step during implicit integration lead to very memory and time consuming simulations there are 54 different ocean wave realizations that are successfully simulated numerically to see the effect of n on the possible variation of maximum tension the parametric bootstrapping process as defined in section 4 1 is carried out for different n and their distribution of initial tension are presented as box and whisker plot in fig 6 the box is drawn from the lower to upper quartile of the bootstrapping result with an orange line at the median the whiskers are extended under and above the box to the 5 and 95 percentile value of the bootstrapping result respectively blue dots are the data that located past the end of the whiskers by increasing n the variation of the bootstrapping results characterized by the median 95 percentile value and the length of the box decreases and as expected convergence in the results is achieved when n exceeds a certain value fig 6 shows that at least n 20 realizations of the ocean surface should be generated to achieve the maximum tension on the umbilical with an acceptable variation 5 rov operation in 3 km depth 5 1 effect of tms in deep water operation effects of tms hook configuration and ocean current profiles in the maximum umbilical tension for rov operation in deep water are firstly investigated five different models as schematically shown in top of fig 7 are studied rov in straight umbilical configuration rov and 1 ton tms in straight umbilical configuration rov and 2 ton tms in straight umbilical configuration rov in 30 m hook configuration and rov in 50 m hook configuration in the numerical models the tms is only modelled as an additional weight on the rov representation and the difference between the hook configuration models lies on the additional umbilical length to form the hook shape all models are arranged so the rov is located at the same depth level resulting different umbilical tension due to self weight between all models for each case the simulation is performed four times i static simulation due to self weight ii static simulation due to self weight and extreme ocean current iii dynamic simulation due to wave and finally iv dynamic simulation under combination of wave and extreme ocean current hs is set to 5 m and tp to 8 s with only one 3 hour wave realization the largest tension in 8 different arc lengths is reported and presented in fig 7 it can be observed that for a 3 km rov operation in harsh environment installing tms leads to swl exceedance at the top end of the umbilical and therefore it should be avoided on the other hand the hook configuration is able to keep the tension along the umbilical below the swl the success of hook configuration and tms to eliminate or reduce the snap load can be determined by analyzing the dynamic amplification factor daf as presented in equation 8 around the bottom end of the umbilical the calculated daf in 8 different arc lengths along the umbilical are presented in table 3 the snap load is characterized by a big daf as experienced by the bottom end of the straight configuration where the daf is in the range of 15 17 utilizing the 1 ton or 2 ton tms increases the static tension at the bottom end of the umbilical which significantly reduces the possibility of snap shown by daf in the range of 2 and 4 however the static tension does not only increase at the bottom end of the umbilical but also over the entire line as shown in fig 7 as a result the swl is exceeded for both tms models at the top end even with a comparable daf to the straight configuration 8 d a f t d y n a m i c t s t a t i c where t tension in the umbilical at the given arc length either from static or dynamic simulation observing the hook configuration models the daf at the bottom end of the umbilical is reduced from the range of 15 17 in the straight configuration to the range of 1 3 5 in the hook configuration with an exception for hook with 30 m additional umbilical under combination of wave and current where the existence of ocean current transformed the bottom part of the umbilical into a straight like taut condition and made it prone to the snap as a result snap occurs at the bottom end of the umbilical indicated by the daf of 7 27 overall these results show that the hook configuration can effectively eliminate or reduce the snap in the umbilical and also ensure that the swl is not exceeded providing that the additional length utilized in the hook configuration is sufficient to keep the bottom part of the umbilical always in a hook configuration in any operational case 5 2 effect of hook configuration in deep water operation a further detailed investigation on the differences between hook and straight configurations is carried out in this section the hook configuration is made by adding 100 m of additional umbilical a 3 hour ocean wave realization with hs 2 5 m and tp 7 s combined with the extreme vertical current profile is utilized for simulating both straight and hook configurations the umbilical and rov responses between the two systems are compared to see how the snap can be diminished by the hook configuration the static tension at the top end is equal to 34 5 kn and 34 3 kn for the straight and hook configuration respectively the tension time history for straight and hook configurations during a certain period of the simulation are presented in fig 8 for straight configuration the snap phenomena are characterized by a certain duration of zero tension followed by a spike in the tension time history at the bottom end of the umbilical this is indicated by the blue line in the bottom end tension plot in fig 8 the spike magnitude is governed by the relative motion between surface vessel and the rov each tension spike at the bottom end of the umbilical is followed by a tension spike at the top end with almost one second delay this shows that the snap load travels along the umbilical with an approximate speed of 3 km s close to shear wave velocity in the steel material which is similar to the one reported by driscoll et al 2000b at the top end of the umbilical the tension fluctuates sharply with high frequency hook configuration on the other hand is able to eliminate the snap in the umbilical resulting a low tension fluctuation almost constant at the bottom end of the umbilical and lower frequency tension fluctuation at the top end compared to the straight configuration the spectral densities of the line tension at the top end in straight and hook configurations are shown in fig 9 the straight configuration suffers from high frequency fluctuations due to snap loads in the system on the contrary the top end of hook configuration experiences tension fluctuation with frequency less than 0 3 hz the peaks of both spectral densities are located at 0 142 and 0 25 hz which are the peak frequency of the wave spectrum and the second peak period of the surface vessel heave motion respectively compared to the straight configuration the hook configuration experiences more energy around its peaks of line tension spectral density it can be concluded that removing the snap from the system eliminates the high frequency tension fluctuation but at the same time there is an increase in the peak of spectral density of tension the snap phenomena are not only affecting the tension fluctuation in the umbilical but also the movement of the rov the rov trajectory spectral density of rov vertical motion rov velocity and rov acceleration are presented in fig 10 and they show that the rov in the straight configuration clearly experiences greater offset spectral density of the rov vertical motion velocity and acceleration also reveal that the snap in the straight configuration produces high frequency disturbance that may prevent the rov to work properly and precisely 5 3 effect of current on deep water operation the analyses continued by performing the dynamic simulation of the two compared configurations under 13 different 3 hour wave realizations in addition for each 3 hour wave realization two different environmental conditions are considered wave with and without the extreme ocean current the purpose of performing two different current conditions is to determine the significance of ocean current on the maximum tension in the line the largest tension in the umbilical from each 3 hour simulation is extracted and compared between different configurations and environmental condition to quantify the difference between configurations and environmental conditions two new ratios are introduced ratio of configuration rc and ratio of current rs the formulation for rs and rc are presented in equations 9 and 10 respectively the maximum tension from each simulated wave realization and the corresponding rs and rc are presented in table 4 9 r c t m a x s t r a i g h t t m a x h o o k 10 r s t m a x c u r r e n t t m a x n o c u r r e n t where r c ratio of configuration r s ratio of current t max maximum tension along the umbilical in the straight or hook configuration both for the inclusion and exclusion of ocean extreme current on the simulation rs are in the range of 1 08 1 17 for all wave realizations this means that by utilizing the hook configuration the largest tension in the umbilical for the straight condition can by reduced by 7 14 due to the elimination of snap from the system for both configurations rs are in the range 0 96 and 1 01 which confirms the insignificant of the ocean extreme current on the largest tension in the umbilical during the simulated rov operation in deep water 5 4 environmental limit of deep water operation maximum umbilical tensions stochastically determined as per section 4 1 for a 3 km rov operation with hook configuration using 100 m additional umbilical under the ocean current and different wave conditions are investigated and the results are presented in table 5 for each wave conditions 20 different 3 hour wave realizations are generated the maximum line tension for the reported wave conditions is up to 52 84 kn which is well below the swl of the umbilical 70 kn it shows that using the hook configuration the rov can safely operate in 3 km depth under wave with hs up to 4 m in summary this section showed that tms is not a good alternative for deep water up to 3 km rov operation due to its effects in increasing the total static weight of the system the ocean current profile when it is combined with different wave conditions has no significant effect on the umbilical tension and therefore can be neglected in numerical simulations for response analysis of the umbilical rov system during deep water operation it was also shown that hook configuration can suppress the occurrences of snap in the system it also helps keeping the umbilical tension under swl and also filters out the harmful high frequency tension fluctuations in the umbilical 6 rov operation in 6 km depth 6 1 hook configuration response analysis of the rov operation in ultra deep water up to 6 km using hook configuration under ocean wave and vessel motion is carried out due to its insignificant effect to the maximum tension the ocean current is excluded from the numerical simulations the maximum static tension in the umbilical due to self weight is 67 kn which is very close to the swl of the umbilical 70 kn for each sea state 20 different 3 hour wave realizations are simulated and the results for maximum umbilical tension stochastically determined as per section 4 1 are presented in table 6 it is seen that the rov can operate safely only under waves with hs 1 5 m and tp 5 s this implies a serious restriction on the operating window for the rov and hence other alternatives to reduce the line tension should be examined 6 2 hook top floater configuration the location and total number of floaters are two main governing parameters in the hook top floater configuration tension load profile along the umbilical from a successful application of hook top floater configuration is presented in fig 11 it shows range graphs of the static minimum dynamic and maximum dynamic tension both for hook top floater and hook configurations the results are taken from one 3 hour wave realization with hs 2 5 m and tp 7 s a sea state where the hook configuration is not safe for rov operation in the hook configuration top part of the umbilical 0 m arc length 800 m experiences maximum tension larger than the swl after installation of the floaters in the chosen location the static tension in top part of the umbilical blue dashed dotted line switches to the graph of hook top floater configuration blue solid line which is far from both swl and zero tension as the result the minimum orange solid line and maximum green solid line dynamic tensions in the umbilical stays inside the zero tension and swl boundaries installing the floaters may also increase the daf of the system for instance by observing fig 11 the daf at the top end for the hook configuration is 1 17 78 6 kn 67 kn however the daf at the top end of the hook top floater configuration is 1 5 57 6 kn 38 4 kn which is 28 larger than that one for the hook configuration this effect should be considered when designing the hook top floater configuration different sea state has different optimized number and location of floaters finding the optimized configuration for floaters and simulating a series of 3 hour analyses is computationally time and memory consuming however a prediction can be made by utilizing the result of hook configuration simulation to determine whether the hook top floater configuration is a safe configuration or not for certain sea state in this case it is assumed that the range graph for static tension is exactly in the middle of the range graphs of maximum and minimum dynamic tensions therefore a simplified criteria for a successful hook top floater configuration can be given by equation 11 where it simply indicates that the hook top floater configuration is a good alternative if the maximum amplitude of tension fluctuation along the umbilical after application of a proper amplification factor af due to installation of floaters is less than half of swl if the amplitude of the amplified tension fluctuation is larger than swl 2 either snap or swl exceedance will occur implying the failure of hook top floater configuration from several hook top floater simulations it is found that af could be up to 1 4 11 a f m a x t m a x d y n a m i c t s t a t i c t s t a t i c t m i n d y n a m i c s w l 2 where t m a x d y n a m i c maximum dynamic tension of hook configuration t m a x d y n a m i c minimum dynamic tension of hook configuration t s t a t i c the largest static tension along the umbilical of hook configuration 67 kn a f amplification factor taken as 1 4 table 7 is prepared based on the application of equation 11 to the hook configuration results as presented in table 6 and it shows the sea states where the hook top floater configuration can potentially be used for safe rov operation in ultra deep waters 6 km depth the safe operating window for the hook configuration of hs 1 5 m and tp 5 s as previously determined in table 6 is now extended to hs 3 5 m and tp 8 5 s for hook top floater configuration which is a big achievement from rov operation perspective 6 3 mid depth hook configuration in this configuration the total buoyancy load provided by the floaters is equal to or greater than the submerged weight of the umbilical rov below the floaters for example to place a series of floaters at the middle part of the 6 km umbilical i e 3 km from the top end of the umbilical at least 34 kn of buoyancy equal to submerged weight of 3 km umbilical and the rov should be provided by the floaters an example range graph of tension for hook and mid depth hook configuration under wave with hs 2 5 m and tp 7 s is presented in fig 12 for mid depth hook configuration it is assumed that 70 floaters are stacked to each other 3 km from top end of umbilical one floater overall dimension is 1 m length by 0 36 m outside diameter with material density of 534 kg m3 and they are able to provide 34 3 kn buoyancy load in total assuming each floater as a solid cylinder the mid depth hook is not only able to keep the tension less than swl but also to eliminate snap from the system moreover fig 12 shows that the mid depth hook configuration has insignificant tension fluctuation for arc lengths greater than 3 km implying that an extended length of the umbilical experiences less disturbance compared to the hook configuration the mid depth configuration also changes the behaviour of tension fluctuation at the top part of the umbilical and makes it strongly similar to the one from the hook configuration in 3 km rov operation fig 13 compares tension time history between hook and mid depth hook configurations for 6 km operation and also the hook configuration in 3 km operation all three cases are able to avoid snap load in the umbilical compared to the hook configuration in 6 km operation the mid depth hook for 6 km operation produces significantly lower tension at the top end of the umbilical however mid depth hook produces slightly larger tension at the bottom end of the umbilical compared to the hook configuration in 3 km operation there is a negligible difference between top end tension of 6 km mid depth hook and 3 km hook configurations this implies the same environmental limit between 6 km mid depth hook and 3 km hook table 8 shows maximum tension on the umbilical in the mid depth hook configuration for various wave conditions the difference between these maximum umbilical tensions and the corresponding values in table 5 is only in the range of 1 7 3 kn table 8 confirms that the mid depth configuration in 6 km water depth similar to the hook configuration for 3 km water depth can be safely operated for all the considered wave conditions 7 rov offset for ultra deep waters either mid depth hook or hook floater configuration can be utilized to ensure a safe rov operation where the mid depth provides more appealing results however to create a perfect mid depth hook configuration a very big floater or a large number of small floaters should be installed to provide sufficient buoyancy load both alternatives significantly increase the drag on the umbilical implying that a longer umbilical should be utilized to send the rov to the target depth especially during the existence of the extreme ocean current for instance by varying the number of installed floaters to produce the mid depth hook configuration assuming 1 kn buoyancy for each floater and taking the static simulation of rov operation in 3 km water depth it shows that increasing the number of floaters significantly increase the required umbilical length to keep the rov at the target depth as presented in fig 14 compared to the no current condition a longer umbilical should be used for rov operation under the extreme current by installing floaters on the umbilical submerged weights of the rov and a certain part of the umbilical are counterbalanced by the buoyancy load of the floaters for simplicity this part of the umbilical is hereafter referenced as the handled umbilical and its length is linearly proportional to total number of floaters there is a drop in the required umbilical length when number of floaters is between 200 and 250 units at this condition the majority of floaters are located around the depth range with multidirectional current as presented in fig 4 causing a weaker umbilical displacement hence a shorter umbilical to send the rov to the target location installing more floaters on the umbilical also reduces the static tension at the top end of the line while the maximum umbilical tension experiences a different trend these are described in fig 15 where both the rov offset and maximum tension in the umbilical are presented as the function of number of floaters the presented results are for rov operation in 3 km water depth under wave condition of hs 4 m and tp 10 s with and without extreme current ocean profile when utilizing small number of floaters the difference between maximum tensions from the compared simulations is negligible but the difference in the rov offset is great by increasing number of floaters the mid depth hook configuration under combination of wave and current requires a significantly longer umbilical to keep the rov in its working depth resulting a higher maximum tension and greater rov offset than the case when the ocean current excluded from simulation the maximum tension commonly occurs at the top end of the umbilical but it is only true if the mid depth hook configuration is manifested with less than 210 floaters when the number of floaters is greater than 210 most weight of the umbilical is counterbalanced by the floaters and the location of maximum tension shifts from top end of umbilical to the vicinity of the closest floater to the surface vessel in addition the rov offset starts to decrease since the floater is closer to the surface vessel in summary fig 15 shows that for the mid depth hook configuration the highest tension reduction is achievable by placing a series of floaters at umbilical s half length though this configuration will induce the greatest rov offset this implies that in using the mid depth configuration there should be further considerations for the maximum acceptable rov offset as it requires longer umbilical to keep the rov in its target depth 8 conclusion there are two main concerns in normal operation of a work class rov in deep and ultra deep water locations maximum line tension as far as the overall structural integrity of the line is concerned and the rov offset as far as rov operation and the required umbilical length are concerned for rov operation in deep and ultra deep waters dynamically amplified tension in the umbilical plays important role in determining the environmental operating window to minimize the tension load in the line three different rov umbilical configurations namely the hook hook top floaters and mid depth hook were numerically investigated and compared with the conventional straight umbilical configuration series of numerical models were generated for each of these configurations and each model was simulated under combination of the ocean current profile and wide range of randomly generated ocean wave conditions a stochastic approach was also developed and utilized to obtain the maximum line tension based on the results from limited number of water surface realizations the main conclusions from this study can be summarized as follows tms can be efficiently used to eliminate or reduce the snap load in the line however using tms for rov operation in ultra deep water due to excessive total submerged weight of the system is not feasible for rov umbilical systems under combination of current profile and randomly generated waves the current profile loading has negligible effect on the umbilical maximum tension and therefore it can be ignored in numerical simulations for 3 km rov operation a hook shape configuration allows the rov to operate without any swl exceedance and existence of snap load in comparison with the straight configuration it helps in reduction of the rov offset and filtering out the destructive snap induced high frequency tension fluctuations in the line for 6 km operation the hook shape should be combined with the installation of floaters around the top part of the umbilical to slightly increase the environmental operating window of the rov with the combination of hook top floater the static tension is reduced significantly providing more room for dynamic tension to exist to gain a broader environmental operating window for 6 km rov operation the mid depth hook configuration in which enough number of floaters are installed on the line between the rov and the surface vessel can be utilized however the mid depth hook enlarges the rov offset and therefore an optimized solution between reducing the line tension and increasing the rov offset should be selected credit authorship contribution statement michael binsar lubis conceptualization methodology software formal analysis investigation

the work reported in this paper acknowledgement the study was a part of the project of design engineering and manufacturing of the first australian ultra deep water work class rov which was partly funded by the australian government through cooperative research centres projects crcp grant under project code crc p57367 this work was performed in collaboration with total marine technology as the industry partner of the project 
20942,the utilization of rov remotely operated vehicle for subsea operation has been increasing in the past few years alongside the increasing use of subsea technologies in deep water oil and gas activities and other maritime operations while survey class rovs have reached the deepest depth in the ocean the work class rovs are mostly limited to 3 km depth for a work class rov operating in deep waters the excessive static tension due to self weight of the rov and its umbilical system leaves small room before the dynamic tension exceeds the safe working load of the umbilical snap loads can also exist in the low tension area of the umbilical when the rov system is under dynamic motions which can lead to a large tensile load in the line therefore there is a need for a practical solution to ensure that the safe working load is not exceeded during ultra deep water operation this study focuses in reducing the tension in the umbilical hence increasing the operational depth of a work class rov from deep to ultra deep waters three different configurations namely the hook hook top floaters and mid depth hook are numerically investigated and compared with the conventional free flying rov configuration firstly deep water operation of a 3 km rov system is simulated under combination of a real extreme vertical current profile and various irregular wave conditions this shows negligible effect of the current profile on umbilical maximum tension the study also shows that for 3 km rov operation the suggested hook configuration is sufficient to effectively reduce the tension load as well as reducing the possibility of snap in the umbilical using hook configuration in the umbilical has significant benefits in minimizing rov motion and also filters out the destructive snap induced high frequency tension fluctuations in the umbilical for 6 km operation either hook top floaters or mid depth hook can be utilized whereas the mid depth hook configuration provides a broader environmental operating window for rov operation however installation of floaters on the umbilical to produce the mid depth hook configuration increases the rov offset keywords rov operation deep water umbilical cable float 1 introduction the moonshot target to reach the deepest part of the ocean using an rov remotely operated vehicle is an interesting story that has been started since 1953 wernli sr 1999 based on the history sending an rov to an ultra deep water location is a challenging task where the mass of the vehicle and the umbilical the cable connecting the rov to the surface facility should be reduced to ensure that the safe working load swl of the umbilical is not exceeded conventionally the umbilical comes in the form of steel armored cable which usually comprises of fiber optics and electrical conductors wernli sr and christ 2014 to reduce the mass of the cable kaiko momma et al 2004 and abismo ishibashi et al 2008 substituted the steel armored cable with kevlar cable where its strength to weight ratio is relatively larger than the conventional steel armored cable however kevlar cable is expensive and has limited lifetimes moreover due to its low density and relatively large cross sectional area the diameter is up to 40 mm for kaiko the kevlar cable experiences a large drag which makes it easier to drift under the action of the ocean current and hence difficult to move the rov horizontally andrew d bowen et al 2004 considering the drawbacks of the kevlar cable nereus a d bowen et al 2009 took the concept of self powered vehicle allowing them to eliminate the electrical conductors from the umbilical as a result the umbilical for nereus was an unarmored lightweight fiber optic with a small diameter only up to 1 mm in addition since the vehicle was self powered the umbilical could be detached from the vehicle transforming the vehicle from rov to auv automated unmanned vehicle hence it was called the hybrid rov lately a combination of kevlar cable up to 7 000 m depth and fiber optic from 7 000 m to 11 000 m depth is under preparation for urov11k nakajoh et al 2018 even though reducing the vehicle and umbilical mass allows the rov to reach deeper locations it also reduces the capabilities of the rov during its deep water operation if in the past the operator was satisfied with sending the rov to the seabed take several seabed samples or pictures and then recover the rov current offshore operations require the rov to do more complicated and heavy activities at greater depth within a longer time window to achieve this more power should be distributed by the umbilical and more complex and heavier equipment should be installed on the rov back in 1999 four years after kaiko reached the deepest point in the ocean there were approximately 500 commercial work class rovs however none of them could operate deeper than 3 000 m wernli sr 1999 in a recent project a steel armored umbilical with fairly small outside diameter was utilized to operate their 4 500 volt work class rov down to 6 000 m depth jaycen 2017 the team utilized an electric controller which allowed them to use fewer conductors resulting a tiny umbilical as small as 17 mm diameter though the diameter is not as small as the unarmored lightweight fiber optic utilized in nereus the reduced umbilical diameter still absorbs less environmental load and has less total self weight compared to the conventional steel armored umbilical to gain further reduction in the total weight the team removed tms tether management system from the rov set up jaycen 2017 however not all work class rovs utilize an electric controller system some rov manufacturers prefer a combination of electric and hydraulic system for their rov instrumentation though small reduction to the conventional umbilical mass and diameter can be achieved for the hydro electric instrumentation this system still leads to a large umbilical diameter combination of wave and ship motion produces significant motions on the rov which amplifies the tension in the umbilical driscoll et al 2000b in the extreme case vertical motion of the rov leads to a snap phenomenon where there is a sudden transition between slack and taut condition in the umbilical when snap occurs series of corresponding spikes are generated in response time history of the umbilical tension where their magnitudes can greatly exceed the safe working load of the line driscoll et al 2000b 2000c one way to avoid snap load during the rov operation is by using heave compensator as shown by driscoll et al 2000 main aim of this study is to find alternative configurations for minimizing the tension in the umbilical not to exceed the safe working load of the line for deep and ultra deep water operation of a work class rov the rov umbilical and environmental data in this study are based on outcomes of the crcp research grant 2017 in engineering design and manufacturing of a new work class rov for operation in ultra deep waters all input data and operational assumptions are given by the rov manufacturer and operator the focus of the research is to test the usage of floaters also known as cable floats to eliminate or reduce the snap load from the system three different innovative configurations namely the hook hook top floaters and mid depth hook are stochastically investigated and compared with the conventional free flying rov configuration the study is carried out for a 6 000 m depth rated work class rov with steel armored umbilical for operation in different water depths 2 umbilical rov configuration 2 1 conventional configuration of deep water rov conventionally a deep water rov system consists of five main components surface vessel umbilical tms tether and rov vessel the control room for piloting the rov together with a launch and recovery system lars to deploy and recover the rov are located at the surface vessel an armored cable called umbilical transmits power and signal from surface vessel to tms the power and signal are then continued from tms to rov by unarmored cable known as tether wernli sr and christ 2014 a schematic view of a conventional rov system is presented in fig 1 in principle tms acts as a heavy item to reduce the rov offset due to current and wave loads during deep water operation tms also acts as a counterweight to reduce risk of snap load when the rov pass through the splash zone during launch and recovery phase for rov operation in deep and ultra deep waters where total self weight of the umbilical and the rov in water is close to swl of the line elimination of the tms and tether is a reasonable alternative to reduce maximum tensile force in the line four main different configurations for direct connection of the rov to the surface vessel as shown in fig 2 are studied in this research straight hook hook top floaters and mid depth hook 2 2 straight configuration straight configuration is the simplest configuration considered in this study which also acts as the benchmark to measure how well the other configurations can reduce the tension in the umbilical in this configuration the rov is hanging freely and the umbilical connects the rov directly to the surface vessel without any wave and current load the umbilical is in a straight vertical shape with linearly decreasing static tension from the vessel connection point to the rov connection point the possibility of snap occurrence in the line around rov connection point is high due to its low static tension straight configuration is illustrated in fig 2a 2 3 hook configuration the hook configuration presented in fig 2b is one way to decouple the rov motion from the surface vessel motion reducing the possibility of snap occurrence in this case a vertical upward force is applied on the rov or on the umbilical around the rov connection which counterbalances the submerged weights of the rov and a short part of the umbilical this upward force creates zero tension condition at a point on the umbilical around rov connection namely zero tension point from structural response perspective this splits the umbilical into top and bottom parts where the top part is supported by the surface vessel and the bottom part is supported by the applied vertical load in reality the vertical force may be generated by an upward rov thrust a positive buoyancy force from the rov or by some additional floaters attached to the umbilical close to rov connection the success of this configuration in decoupling the rov and surface vessel motions lies on the ability of the upward force to create the zero tension point along the umbilical 2 4 hook top floaters configuration during rov operation in deep water the static tension at the upper part of the umbilical can be close to its swl the combination of dynamic and static tension may exceed the swl even when the snap has been eliminated by the hook configuration in this case the rov should only be operated in a relatively calm sea to reduce the dynamic tension which limits the operating window of the rov the static tension can be reduced by installing a series of floaters along the umbilical since large tension naturally exists at the top part of the umbilical it is logical to install the floaters at this high risk area of exceeding swl the success of this configuration lies on the ability of the system to ensure that the static tension around the floaters is well below swl of the umbilical and still far enough from zero tension if the static tension is too close to swl the total tension in the line may exceed the swl due to dynamic effects if the static tension is too close to zero then the umbilical may experience large snap loads which also means the possibility of swl exceedance the location and number of the floaters can be optimized to produce an effective hook and top floater configuration however the minimum number of floaters that should be installed strongly depends on the target operational environment harsher environment induces larger dynamic tension in the line requiring larger number of floaters to be installed on the umbilical fig 2c shows a general view of the hook and top floaters configuration 2 5 mid depth hook configuration this configuration is similar to the hook configuration with the exception that the individual floaters are installed far from the rov as typically shown in fig 2d in this case the zero tension point occurs around the floaters in the mid depth hook configuration since the submerged weight of a long umbilical segment should be taken by the floaters the amount of additional buoyancy to be provided by the floaters is much bigger than that one required in the hook configuration however by installing more floaters around the mid depth of the umbilical it will not only decouple the rov motion from the vessel motion similar to the hook configuration but also reduces the static tension in the top part of the umbilical similar to hook and top floaters configuration as a result the rov can be operated under more severe environmental conditions 3 numerical model 3 1 umbilical and rov model various methods have been developed to model the structural response of flexible structures under wave and current loads in general there are three main categories finite difference model ablow and schechter 1983 gobat and grosenbaugh 2006 grosenbaugh et al 1993 2007 howell 1991 finite element model delmer et al 1988 ketchman and lou 1975 mcnamara et al 1988 quan et al 2016 and lumped mass model bradley j buckham et al 2003 b j buckham and nahon 2001 driscoll et al 2000a huang and vassalos 1993 niedzwecki and thampi 1988 in this study the umbilical is modelled using the lmm in orcaflex orcina 2019 the element sizes are varied from a coarse mesh gradually decrease from 10m 5m 2 5m and 1m segment lengths at the upper and middle part of the umbilical to a fine mesh 30 cm segment length at the bottom part of the umbilical the fine mesh is only employed to model the bottom part of the umbilical since this part has low static tension making it more prone to large lateral motions and or slack conditions the line element is also restricted from experiencing any compression above the euler buckling load of the line segment see orcina 2019 for further information making the line model able to represent slack condition numerically the rov is defined as a 3d buoy with three translational dofs degrees of freedom the ship motions are considered in all simulations and modelled by defining the rao of the ship in 6 dofs and the rov is assumed to be deployed from starboard side of a medium size surface vessel with length of 103 m and displacement of 9 000 tones torsion stiffness of the umbilical is neglected and its swl is 70 kn the time interval for implicit integration is set to 0 01s to ensure a stable implicit integration during the occurrence of snap the rov model and umbilical specifications are presented in table 1 and general view of the model in shown in fig 3 3 2 environmental condition in this study the wave is represented by a jonswap spectrum dnv 2019 as per imca international marine contractors association rovs may be required to operate under wave environment with maximum significant wave height hs between 2 5 and 6 0 m and wave period of 8 10 s imca 2013 considering the project requirements for the rov operation in this study and the suggested validity range of the jonswap spectrum dnv 2019 only several combinations of significant wave height hs and spectral peak period tp are included in the numerical simulations as presented in table 2 for structural analysis of rov umbilical during deep water operation appropriate vertical current profile is also required to achieve accurate response of the system lubis et al 2020 investigated the extreme current profile for deep water operation of the same umbilical rov system as this study at a location with 3 6 km depth in the gulf of mexico the results as presented in fig 4 are utilized in this study two different water depths of 3 and 6 km are analyzed in this study for the case of 3 km water depth the current profile is interpolated and then tapered at 3 km water depth and the rov system is simulated under combination of the extreme current various wave states and the vessel motions the result of 3 km study is then considered during the preparation of 6 km simulation 4 estimating the maximum tension 4 1 stochastic approach in estimating maximum tension due to the random nature of ocean waves the maximum tension on the umbilical should be determined under various realizations of ocean surface for ocean structures in general the extreme response is commonly predicted by performing statistical analysis on the structural response under n number of 3 hour ocean wave realizations since the irregular wave can be considered as a stationary process for 3 hours dnv 2019 a statistical analysis can then be performed by fitting a distribution such as gumbel distribution stanisic et al 2018 to n sample of maximum responses the value of n should be large to ensure a small error in the statistical analysis however n is commonly set in the range of 10 30 in conventional engineering practice due to computational limitations stanisic et al 2018 showed that 30 40 simulations were required when analyzing a strongly nonlinear and dynamically sensitive system since n is set as a finite number an error measure to the maximum tension on the umbilical should be established in this case similar to bootstrapping methodology presented by haver and winterstein 2008 the parametric bootstrap framework is chosen to determine the error of the maximum tension in a stochastic approach in the performed parametric bootstrap n number of maximum tensions x referred as original dataset are taken from n 3 hour simulations are fitted to gumbel distribution f x through method of moment after that n number of new maximum tensions x referred as synthesis dataset are generated using f x through monte carlo simulation then a new gumbel distribution f x is fitted into the synthesis dataset the monte carlo procedure is repeated 10 000 times producing 10 000 different f x with different 95 percentile values sorting the 10 000 samples of the 95 percentile value produces another empirical cumulative distribution function referred here as the cdf of initial maximum tension then the 95 percentile value of the cdf of initial maximum tension is taken as the final maximum tension xf or maximum tension to make it simply referred equations 1 and 7 shows the fitted gumbel cdf from the original and synthetic data respectively fig 5 presents the flowchart of the bootstrapping process as implemented in

between 0 and 1 4 2 estimating minimum number of wave realizations the minimum number of ocean surface realizations n for time history analysis of structural systems under randomly generated waves varies for different offshore systems a brief study is carried out here to determine n for deep water rov operation a 3 km rov operation with the straight configuration is analyzed under a combination of the extreme vertical current profile and an irregular wave with hs 5 m and tp 8 s the fine mesh and small time step during implicit integration lead to very memory and time consuming simulations there are 54 different ocean wave realizations that are successfully simulated numerically to see the effect of n on the possible variation of maximum tension the parametric bootstrapping process as defined in section 4 1 is carried out for different n and their distribution of initial tension are presented as box and whisker plot in fig 6 the box is drawn from the lower to upper quartile of the bootstrapping result with an orange line at the median the whiskers are extended under and above the box to the 5 and 95 percentile value of the bootstrapping result respectively blue dots are the data that located past the end of the whiskers by increasing n the variation of the bootstrapping results characterized by the median 95 percentile value and the length of the box decreases and as expected convergence in the results is achieved when n exceeds a certain value fig 6 shows that at least n 20 realizations of the ocean surface should be generated to achieve the maximum tension on the umbilical with an acceptable variation 5 rov operation in 3 km depth 5 1 effect of tms in deep water operation effects of tms hook configuration and ocean current profiles in the maximum umbilical tension for rov operation in deep water are firstly investigated five different models as schematically shown in top of fig 7 are studied rov in straight umbilical configuration rov and 1 ton tms in straight umbilical configuration rov and 2 ton tms in straight umbilical configuration rov in 30 m hook configuration and rov in 50 m hook configuration in the numerical models the tms is only modelled as an additional weight on the rov representation and the difference between the hook configuration models lies on the additional umbilical length to form the hook shape all models are arranged so the rov is located at the same depth level resulting different umbilical tension due to self weight between all models for each case the simulation is performed four times i static simulation due to self weight ii static simulation due to self weight and extreme ocean current iii dynamic simulation due to wave and finally iv dynamic simulation under combination of wave and extreme ocean current hs is set to 5 m and tp to 8 s with only one 3 hour wave realization the largest tension in 8 different arc lengths is reported and presented in fig 7 it can be observed that for a 3 km rov operation in harsh environment installing tms leads to swl exceedance at the top end of the umbilical and therefore it should be avoided on the other hand the hook configuration is able to keep the tension along the umbilical below the swl the success of hook configuration and tms to eliminate or reduce the snap load can be determined by analyzing the dynamic amplification factor daf as presented in equation 8 around the bottom end of the umbilical the calculated daf in 8 different arc lengths along the umbilical are presented in table 3 the snap load is characterized by a big daf as experienced by the bottom end of the straight configuration where the daf is in the range of 15 17 utilizing the 1 ton or 2 ton tms increases the static tension at the bottom end of the umbilical which significantly reduces the possibility of snap shown by daf in the range of 2 and 4 however the static tension does not only increase at the bottom end of the umbilical but also over the entire line as shown in fig 7 as a result the swl is exceeded for both tms models at the top end even with a comparable daf to the straight configuration 8 d a f t d y n a m i c t s t a t i c where t tension in the umbilical at the given arc length either from static or dynamic simulation observing the hook configuration models the daf at the bottom end of the umbilical is reduced from the range of 15 17 in the straight configuration to the range of 1 3 5 in the hook configuration with an exception for hook with 30 m additional umbilical under combination of wave and current where the existence of ocean current transformed the bottom part of the umbilical into a straight like taut condition and made it prone to the snap as a result snap occurs at the bottom end of the umbilical indicated by the daf of 7 27 overall these results show that the hook configuration can effectively eliminate or reduce the snap in the umbilical and also ensure that the swl is not exceeded providing that the additional length utilized in the hook configuration is sufficient to keep the bottom part of the umbilical always in a hook configuration in any operational case 5 2 effect of hook configuration in deep water operation a further detailed investigation on the differences between hook and straight configurations is carried out in this section the hook configuration is made by adding 100 m of additional umbilical a 3 hour ocean wave realization with hs 2 5 m and tp 7 s combined with the extreme vertical current profile is utilized for simulating both straight and hook configurations the umbilical and rov responses between the two systems are compared to see how the snap can be diminished by the hook configuration the static tension at the top end is equal to 34 5 kn and 34 3 kn for the straight and hook configuration respectively the tension time history for straight and hook configurations during a certain period of the simulation are presented in fig 8 for straight configuration the snap phenomena are characterized by a certain duration of zero tension followed by a spike in the tension time history at the bottom end of the umbilical this is indicated by the blue line in the bottom end tension plot in fig 8 the spike magnitude is governed by the relative motion between surface vessel and the rov each tension spike at the bottom end of the umbilical is followed by a tension spike at the top end with almost one second delay this shows that the snap load travels along the umbilical with an approximate speed of 3 km s close to shear wave velocity in the steel material which is similar to the one reported by driscoll et al 2000b at the top end of the umbilical the tension fluctuates sharply with high frequency hook configuration on the other hand is able to eliminate the snap in the umbilical resulting a low tension fluctuation almost constant at the bottom end of the umbilical and lower frequency tension fluctuation at the top end compared to the straight configuration the spectral densities of the line tension at the top end in straight and hook configurations are shown in fig 9 the straight configuration suffers from high frequency fluctuations due to snap loads in the system on the contrary the top end of hook configuration experiences tension fluctuation with frequency less than 0 3 hz the peaks of both spectral densities are located at 0 142 and 0 25 hz which are the peak frequency of the wave spectrum and the second peak period of the surface vessel heave motion respectively compared to the straight configuration the hook configuration experiences more energy around its peaks of line tension spectral density it can be concluded that removing the snap from the system eliminates the high frequency tension fluctuation but at the same time there is an increase in the peak of spectral density of tension the snap phenomena are not only affecting the tension fluctuation in the umbilical but also the movement of the rov the rov trajectory spectral density of rov vertical motion rov velocity and rov acceleration are presented in fig 10 and they show that the rov in the straight configuration clearly experiences greater offset spectral density of the rov vertical motion velocity and acceleration also reveal that the snap in the straight configuration produces high frequency disturbance that may prevent the rov to work properly and precisely 5 3 effect of current on deep water operation the analyses continued by performing the dynamic simulation of the two compared configurations under 13 different 3 hour wave realizations in addition for each 3 hour wave realization two different environmental conditions are considered wave with and without the extreme ocean current the purpose of performing two different current conditions is to determine the significance of ocean current on the maximum tension in the line the largest tension in the umbilical from each 3 hour simulation is extracted and compared between different configurations and environmental condition to quantify the difference between configurations and environmental conditions two new ratios are introduced ratio of configuration rc and ratio of current rs the formulation for rs and rc are presented in equations 9 and 10 respectively the maximum tension from each simulated wave realization and the corresponding rs and rc are presented in table 4 9 r c t m a x s t r a i g h t t m a x h o o k 10 r s t m a x c u r r e n t t m a x n o c u r r e n t where r c ratio of configuration r s ratio of current t max maximum tension along the umbilical in the straight or hook configuration both for the inclusion and exclusion of ocean extreme current on the simulation rs are in the range of 1 08 1 17 for all wave realizations this means that by utilizing the hook configuration the largest tension in the umbilical for the straight condition can by reduced by 7 14 due to the elimination of snap from the system for both configurations rs are in the range 0 96 and 1 01 which confirms the insignificant of the ocean extreme current on the largest tension in the umbilical during the simulated rov operation in deep water 5 4 environmental limit of deep water operation maximum umbilical tensions stochastically determined as per section 4 1 for a 3 km rov operation with hook configuration using 100 m additional umbilical under the ocean current and different wave conditions are investigated and the results are presented in table 5 for each wave conditions 20 different 3 hour wave realizations are generated the maximum line tension for the reported wave conditions is up to 52 84 kn which is well below the swl of the umbilical 70 kn it shows that using the hook configuration the rov can safely operate in 3 km depth under wave with hs up to 4 m in summary this section showed that tms is not a good alternative for deep water up to 3 km rov operation due to its effects in increasing the total static weight of the system the ocean current profile when it is combined with different wave conditions has no significant effect on the umbilical tension and therefore can be neglected in numerical simulations for response analysis of the umbilical rov system during deep water operation it was also shown that hook configuration can suppress the occurrences of snap in the system it also helps keeping the umbilical tension under swl and also filters out the harmful high frequency tension fluctuations in the umbilical 6 rov operation in 6 km depth 6 1 hook configuration response analysis of the rov operation in ultra deep water up to 6 km using hook configuration under ocean wave and vessel motion is carried out due to its insignificant effect to the maximum tension the ocean current is excluded from the numerical simulations the maximum static tension in the umbilical due to self weight is 67 kn which is very close to the swl of the umbilical 70 kn for each sea state 20 different 3 hour wave realizations are simulated and the results for maximum umbilical tension stochastically determined as per section 4 1 are presented in table 6 it is seen that the rov can operate safely only under waves with hs 1 5 m and tp 5 s this implies a serious restriction on the operating window for the rov and hence other alternatives to reduce the line tension should be examined 6 2 hook top floater configuration the location and total number of floaters are two main governing parameters in the hook top floater configuration tension load profile along the umbilical from a successful application of hook top floater configuration is presented in fig 11 it shows range graphs of the static minimum dynamic and maximum dynamic tension both for hook top floater and hook configurations the results are taken from one 3 hour wave realization with hs 2 5 m and tp 7 s a sea state where the hook configuration is not safe for rov operation in the hook configuration top part of the umbilical 0 m arc length 800 m experiences maximum tension larger than the swl after installation of the floaters in the chosen location the static tension in top part of the umbilical blue dashed dotted line switches to the graph of hook top floater configuration blue solid line which is far from both swl and zero tension as the result the minimum orange solid line and maximum green solid line dynamic tensions in the umbilical stays inside the zero tension and swl boundaries installing the floaters may also increase the daf of the system for instance by observing fig 11 the daf at the top end for the hook configuration is 1 17 78 6 kn 67 kn however the daf at the top end of the hook top floater configuration is 1 5 57 6 kn 38 4 kn which is 28 larger than that one for the hook configuration this effect should be considered when designing the hook top floater configuration different sea state has different optimized number and location of floaters finding the optimized configuration for floaters and simulating a series of 3 hour analyses is computationally time and memory consuming however a prediction can be made by utilizing the result of hook configuration simulation to determine whether the hook top floater configuration is a safe configuration or not for certain sea state in this case it is assumed that the range graph for static tension is exactly in the middle of the range graphs of maximum and minimum dynamic tensions therefore a simplified criteria for a successful hook top floater configuration can be given by equation 11 where it simply indicates that the hook top floater configuration is a good alternative if the maximum amplitude of tension fluctuation along the umbilical after application of a proper amplification factor af due to installation of floaters is less than half of swl if the amplitude of the amplified tension fluctuation is larger than swl 2 either snap or swl exceedance will occur implying the failure of hook top floater configuration from several hook top floater simulations it is found that af could be up to 1 4 11 a f m a x t m a x d y n a m i c t s t a t i c t s t a t i c t m i n d y n a m i c s w l 2 where t m a x d y n a m i c maximum dynamic tension of hook configuration t m a x d y n a m i c minimum dynamic tension of hook configuration t s t a t i c the largest static tension along the umbilical of hook configuration 67 kn a f amplification factor taken as 1 4 table 7 is prepared based on the application of equation 11 to the hook configuration results as presented in table 6 and it shows the sea states where the hook top floater configuration can potentially be used for safe rov operation in ultra deep waters 6 km depth the safe operating window for the hook configuration of hs 1 5 m and tp 5 s as previously determined in table 6 is now extended to hs 3 5 m and tp 8 5 s for hook top floater configuration which is a big achievement from rov operation perspective 6 3 mid depth hook configuration in this configuration the total buoyancy load provided by the floaters is equal to or greater than the submerged weight of the umbilical rov below the floaters for example to place a series of floaters at the middle part of the 6 km umbilical i e 3 km from the top end of the umbilical at least 34 kn of buoyancy equal to submerged weight of 3 km umbilical and the rov should be provided by the floaters an example range graph of tension for hook and mid depth hook configuration under wave with hs 2 5 m and tp 7 s is presented in fig 12 for mid depth hook configuration it is assumed that 70 floaters are stacked to each other 3 km from top end of umbilical one floater overall dimension is 1 m length by 0 36 m outside diameter with material density of 534 kg m3 and they are able to provide 34 3 kn buoyancy load in total assuming each floater as a solid cylinder the mid depth hook is not only able to keep the tension less than swl but also to eliminate snap from the system moreover fig 12 shows that the mid depth hook configuration has insignificant tension fluctuation for arc lengths greater than 3 km implying that an extended length of the umbilical experiences less disturbance compared to the hook configuration the mid depth configuration also changes the behaviour of tension fluctuation at the top part of the umbilical and makes it strongly similar to the one from the hook configuration in 3 km rov operation fig 13 compares tension time history between hook and mid depth hook configurations for 6 km operation and also the hook configuration in 3 km operation all three cases are able to avoid snap load in the umbilical compared to the hook configuration in 6 km operation the mid depth hook for 6 km operation produces significantly lower tension at the top end of the umbilical however mid depth hook produces slightly larger tension at the bottom end of the umbilical compared to the hook configuration in 3 km operation there is a negligible difference between top end tension of 6 km mid depth hook and 3 km hook configurations this implies the same environmental limit between 6 km mid depth hook and 3 km hook table 8 shows maximum tension on the umbilical in the mid depth hook configuration for various wave conditions the difference between these maximum umbilical tensions and the corresponding values in table 5 is only in the range of 1 7 3 kn table 8 confirms that the mid depth configuration in 6 km water depth similar to the hook configuration for 3 km water depth can be safely operated for all the considered wave conditions 7 rov offset for ultra deep waters either mid depth hook or hook floater configuration can be utilized to ensure a safe rov operation where the mid depth provides more appealing results however to create a perfect mid depth hook configuration a very big floater or a large number of small floaters should be installed to provide sufficient buoyancy load both alternatives significantly increase the drag on the umbilical implying that a longer umbilical should be utilized to send the rov to the target depth especially during the existence of the extreme ocean current for instance by varying the number of installed floaters to produce the mid depth hook configuration assuming 1 kn buoyancy for each floater and taking the static simulation of rov operation in 3 km water depth it shows that increasing the number of floaters significantly increase the required umbilical length to keep the rov at the target depth as presented in fig 14 compared to the no current condition a longer umbilical should be used for rov operation under the extreme current by installing floaters on the umbilical submerged weights of the rov and a certain part of the umbilical are counterbalanced by the buoyancy load of the floaters for simplicity this part of the umbilical is hereafter referenced as the handled umbilical and its length is linearly proportional to total number of floaters there is a drop in the required umbilical length when number of floaters is between 200 and 250 units at this condition the majority of floaters are located around the depth range with multidirectional current as presented in fig 4 causing a weaker umbilical displacement hence a shorter umbilical to send the rov to the target location installing more floaters on the umbilical also reduces the static tension at the top end of the line while the maximum umbilical tension experiences a different trend these are described in fig 15 where both the rov offset and maximum tension in the umbilical are presented as the function of number of floaters the presented results are for rov operation in 3 km water depth under wave condition of hs 4 m and tp 10 s with and without extreme current ocean profile when utilizing small number of floaters the difference between maximum tensions from the compared simulations is negligible but the difference in the rov offset is great by increasing number of floaters the mid depth hook configuration under combination of wave and current requires a significantly longer umbilical to keep the rov in its working depth resulting a higher maximum tension and greater rov offset than the case when the ocean current excluded from simulation the maximum tension commonly occurs at the top end of the umbilical but it is only true if the mid depth hook configuration is manifested with less than 210 floaters when the number of floaters is greater than 210 most weight of the umbilical is counterbalanced by the floaters and the location of maximum tension shifts from top end of umbilical to the vicinity of the closest floater to the surface vessel in addition the rov offset starts to decrease since the floater is closer to the surface vessel in summary fig 15 shows that for the mid depth hook configuration the highest tension reduction is achievable by placing a series of floaters at umbilical s half length though this configuration will induce the greatest rov offset this implies that in using the mid depth configuration there should be further considerations for the maximum acceptable rov offset as it requires longer umbilical to keep the rov in its target depth 8 conclusion there are two main concerns in normal operation of a work class rov in deep and ultra deep water locations maximum line tension as far as the overall structural integrity of the line is concerned and the rov offset as far as rov operation and the required umbilical length are concerned for rov operation in deep and ultra deep waters dynamically amplified tension in the umbilical plays important role in determining the environmental operating window to minimize the tension load in the line three different rov umbilical configurations namely the hook hook top floaters and mid depth hook were numerically investigated and compared with the conventional straight umbilical configuration series of numerical models were generated for each of these configurations and each model was simulated under combination of the ocean current profile and wide range of randomly generated ocean wave conditions a stochastic approach was also developed and utilized to obtain the maximum line tension based on the results from limited number of water surface realizations the main conclusions from this study can be summarized as follows tms can be efficiently used to eliminate or reduce the snap load in the line however using tms for rov operation in ultra deep water due to excessive total submerged weight of the system is not feasible for rov umbilical systems under combination of current profile and randomly generated waves the current profile loading has negligible effect on the umbilical maximum tension and therefore it can be ignored in numerical simulations for 3 km rov operation a hook shape configuration allows the rov to operate without any swl exceedance and existence of snap load in comparison with the straight configuration it helps in reduction of the rov offset and filtering out the destructive snap induced high frequency tension fluctuations in the line for 6 km operation the hook shape should be combined with the installation of floaters around the top part of the umbilical to slightly increase the environmental operating window of the rov with the combination of hook top floater the static tension is reduced significantly providing more room for dynamic tension to exist to gain a broader environmental operating window for 6 km rov operation the mid depth hook configuration in which enough number of floaters are installed on the line between the rov and the surface vessel can be utilized however the mid depth hook enlarges the rov offset and therefore an optimized solution between reducing the line tension and increasing the rov offset should be selected credit authorship contribution statement michael binsar lubis conceptualization methodology software formal analysis investigation

the results show that the vortex forms vary according to the groove angle it is seen that the vortex the cylinders especially positioned at h 0 mm and h 60 mm are affected owing to the surface and bottom effect furthermore the largest reynolds stress is observed at the h 37 5 mm while the largest wake region is observed at the h 52 5 mm also the maximum drag coefficient cd and turbulence kinetic energy tke are observed at h 0 mm a 90 for grooved cylinder and at h 37 5 mm for bare cylinder respectively keywords drag coefficient grooved cylinder turbulence kinetic energy particle image velocimetry dye experiment 1 introduction in the environment many objects are seen in the flow affected by the fluid this flow creates non permanent loads both on the body and behind the body these loads and vibrations cause fatigue in the body besides these vortices affect the environmental factors especially in shallow water applications resulting in erosion in streams and rivers and transport of particles and pollution at the bottom in order to prevent the problems caused by the vortex structure formed behind an object placed in the flow it is necessary to control the non permanent flow structure and to reduce the turbulence intensity in the region behind the body in general control methods in the flow around an object are divided into two categories these are active and passive control methods active control is affected by the outside in passive control there is no external energy supply to change the flow structure we could see some major examples about flow control in literature as can be seen below yagmur et al 2017 examined a triangular cylinder with the different reynolds numbers and results were compared by using particle image velocimetry and large eddy simulation methods the data obtained as a result of this experiment were as follows as the reynolds numbers were increased the cd decreased however the power spectral density psd and the vortex shedding frequency increased for the same reynolds numbers the experimental and numerical results were consistent sooraj et al 2019 studied an investigation about three vertical arranged cylinders for the ratio of the distance between the cylinders s and the diameter of the cylinders d the interface of the inner shear layers formed between the cylinders was greater compared to the interaction between the shear layers formed around a roll for lower void rates this means that according to the experiment flow characteristics and cd were affected by different reynolds number and gap ratio ozdil and akilli 2019 showed single and dual cylinders positioned parallel to the channel bottom the cylinder is located at different levels during the experiments to examine the effect of the gap on flow characteristics the dimension of the wake area rises as the space between tandem cylinders deepens ozdil and akilli 2015 demonstrated flow characteristics around the horizontal cylinder this cylinder was positioned as a different immersion ratio as this ratio was increased from 0 25 to 1 the jet like flow velocity was increased after ratio1 values had changed oruç et al 2016 investigated bare and drop shaped mesh cylinders using the piv method with passive control at this experiment reynolds numbers were determined with different parameters it was substantially vortexes on a large scale in the downstream direction of the bare cylinder to make flow control they shaped cylinders as drop mesh they managed large scale vortical flow structure vorticity layers reynolds shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy as a result of this study the flow structure was controlled successfully oruc 2012 studied both bare cylinders and streamline shaped cylinders it was observed that flow was controlled with a shaped cylinder in comparison with the bare cylinder at their experiment results flow more controlled at shaped cylinders when it was compared cylinder shape and l d ratio effect on the flow characteristic canpolat and sahin 2017 investigated square grooved cylinder was positioned at different groove angles in the water by using piv method according to this experiment it was observed that the critical angle was 80 since flow separation started and occurred vorticity karman vortex etc at this angle the flow characteristic of hole circular cylinders was investigated by durhasan et al 2018 moreover the piv method was used at this experiment and cylinder diameter and reynolds number was in the experiment it was aimed to control vortex by changing the hole in different range as a result of these phenomena as the hole was increased the wake region decreased due to elongated and fragmented shear layers and reduced magnitudes of vortices zhou et al 2015 aimed to show flow characteristics with smooth grooved and dimpled cylinders using a piezo electric load cell and piv the experiment was carried out on the open channel towing tang according to the result of the experiment the flow was more controlled at grooved and dimpled than the smooth cylinder yayla and teksin 2018 the flow structures behind the flexible separating plate attached to a circular cylinder and the post flow wake were examined qualitatively and quantitatively in three different reynolds numbers in deep water as a result of concluded that the flexible separation plate was found to have a significant effect in vortex pouring and the fluctuations are significantly attenuated using control material liu and shi 2011 used cacti shaped and smooth surfaces cylinder by using piv method in order to understand the wake characteristic of the cylinders it had been observed that small vortices superimposed on the slicing layers behind the grooved cylinder were developed and transported downstream in the same phase as a result a drastic reduction in vortex force on the roller surface was observed canpolat 2015 studied the flow structure flowing over different rectangular groove shaped cylinder positioned at different angles using the piv method it was concluded that the position of the groove on the surface of the cylinder had an effect on the function of the wake flow structure the frequency of karman vortex shedding depended greatly on the groove size finally shear layer instability with external frequencies was induced on the grooved side rinoshika and rinoshika 2019 studied a front inclined hole on flow structures around a surface mounted short cylinder compared with standard cylinder with inclined hole the separation region along the free end surface is observed to decline and the rear separation increases in the recirculation region vortex and reynolds shear stresses were also suppressed pinar et al 2015 studied cylinder perforated with different hole sizes using the piv method to learn more about the flow characteristics the cutting layer was extended fluctuations were considerably decreased and karman vortex was impeded successfully using porosity cylinders najafi et al 2016 studied different angles of divergence about close to the cylinder the time average flow configuration using piv and dye experiment a bipolar pattern with close vigilance was observed as the flow pattern and deviation angle changed gozmen et al 2013 examined bare and different sizes separating platforms to investigate the vortex discharge of a circular cylinder in shallow water by piv method reynolds stress was shown to be significantly reduced in the bare cylinder fırat et al 2015 examined the flow structure of the cylinder and the square prism placed behind it at different distances and different angles as numeric the efficacy of the control rod in minimizing the time averaged drag coefficient of the total system was decreased with an increased angle karasu 2020 researched flow regulation over a diamond shaped cylinder utilizing piv slits experimentally the results suggest that the use of slits could be an efficient passive control strategy for diamond shaped cylinders kahraman et al 2012 studied horizontal cylinder with different cylinder diameter reynolds number and froude number using piv method as cylinder diameter was increased vorticity intensity reynolds stress correlations and the primary recirculating bubble lengths increase gao et al 2018 examined the flow activity of the clockwise and counter clockwise rotating cylinder clockwise and counterclockwise rotation created major wake effects and altered the wake flow mechanisms and vortex shedding patterns the time averaged streamline models tended to be non symmetrical about the longitudinal flow axis narayanan et al 2018 studied on elastic filament attached to a circular cylinder under uniform flow their study was carried out for different wall proximities and gap ratios numerically as a result of their study with lower gap ratios of 0 5 and 0 6 flapping amplitude modulations were found moreover the frequency of flaps was in conjunction with the shedding frequency in their study wang et al 2015 performed a study to investigate the movement of two tandem cylinders near and parallel to the plane wall using piv method the reynolds number was selected in 6300 the other parameters were spacing ratio and gap to cylinder diameter ratio the cylinder center to center spacing ratio was changing from 1 5 to 6 and the gap height to cylinder diameter ratio from 0 15 to 2 they observed that vortex shedding suppressed according to with cylinders position as a result yang et al 2018 investigated an experimental study about the pressure distribution and the hydrodynamic forces on a cylinder placed near a plane boundary at various reynolds numbers and g d ratios where g was the distance between cylinder and ground of the channel according to this study the drag coefficient at smaller g d ratios decreased examined a numerical study about flow characteristics of circular diamond and square cross sectional cylinders to reveal the wall proximity effects the study was carried out in a 2d domain with the finite volume discretization method for re 20000 and unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with spalart allmaras turbulence model was used according to the results for the same g d ratio the highest st was observed in a circular cylinder although shedding frequencies increased as the g d ratio increased for all types of cylinders shi et al 2010 investigated an experimental study for wall proximity on flow characteristics on a 2d square cylinder with piv and tr piv methods reynolds number was selected as 2250 and g d ratios were selected as 0 1 0 2 0 4 and 0 8 furthermore the proper orthogonal decomposition pod method was used to decompose the tr piv results according to the results the slight spatial asymmetry of the two time mean recirculation zones was observed for the g d 0 8 and 0 4 with vortex shedding moreover with the reduction of g d from 0 2 to 0 1 vortex shedding was suppressed and a large separation bubble was attached to the wall gozmen et al 2013 performed an experimental study about flow characteristics over a circular cylinder in the vicinity of a flat plate using piv method the cylinder was located above the flat plate with its axis parallel to the wall and normal to the flow direction the reynolds number was selected as 1072 and the g d ratios were varied from 0 to 3 the results showed that when the g d 2 the cylinder wake observed asymmetric and a boundary layer separation was induced on the flat plate downstream of the cylinder furthermore with the decreasing g d until the critical gap ratio as 0 25 the wake vortex shedding frequency increased oner et al 2008 examined the velocity field in a steady 2d turbulent flow around a horizontal circular cylinder near a plane boundary with piv technique g d ratios were selected as 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 6 1 and 2 reynolds numbers were selected as 840 4150 and 9500 the results indicated that the changes in the flow structure become very slow as g d 0 3 and the wall proximity effect on the flow around the cylinder become significant as g d 1 zhou et al 2015 examined the velocity field of 2d turbulent flow around a partially buried circular cylinder on a smooth plane boundary with piv technique the experiments were conducted for re 1000 3000 5000 and 7000 b d ratios where b was the burial ratio were selected as 0 25 and 0 5 the results showed that the separation points on the cylinder surface and the length of the separation region upstream and downstream of the cylinder were strongly dependent on the b d ratio and re number the location of boundary separation on the cylinder moved further upstream for higher re numbers and it shifted in downstream direction with the increment of b d ratio it is very little distance between the bottom of the fluid and the upper of the fluid in the shallow water this makes the fluid more complicated than deep waters however there are not enough studies on shallow water in the literature it is aimed to control formed non permanent flow on the back of a cylinder positioned at different height geometries and angles at the shallow water passively in this study as a result this study can fill the shallow water research gap in the literature 2 materials and methods this study was performed at çukurova university department of mechanical engineering a closed water duct installed in the fluid mechanics laboratory the water canal consists of two pieces of storage and an acrylic section between these two warehouses with dimensions 8000x1000 750 mm length x width x height the test area scale used for piv was 142 4 106 8 mm length x width the speed of the water in the channel was adjusted by a pump operating at different speeds with the help of a speed control unit two different shape cylinders made of polyoxymethylene material which had 30 mm diameter were used in this experiment as triangular groove shape cylinder and bare cylinder the schematic representation of the models can be seen in fig 1 the cylinder has a groove which is triangular shape as a circular sector since the triangular groove is equilateral its interior angles are equal and 60 the height of the groove is 3 mm the boundary layer thickness is calculated as δ 34 77 mm for the distance of x 1250 mm from the beginning of test area to cylinders the triangular groove shape cylinder was rotated at a 0 80 85 90 and 95 at the clockwise direction the flow direction of the water was zero moreover cylinders were positioned at h 0 mm 15 mm 22 5 mm 30 mm 37 5 mm 45 mm 52 5 mm and 60 mm from the bottom of the water to upwards respectively the water height was kept constant at hw 90 mm as well as reynolds number and froude number are 5000 and 0 27 respectively the calculated froude number is below from critical froude number fr 1 which means the results were valid for subcritical regimes the experimental setup was demonstrated in fig 2 furthermore the cylinders were located 4000 mm away from the start of the channel in order to obtain fully developed flow during the experiment due to the special design of the canal and honeycomb the turbulence intensity of the canal is less than 0 4 the drag coefficient is the dimensionless quantity used to calculate the friction or resistance of an entity in a fluid setting such as air or water for this reason drag coefficient is a crucial parameter and examining drag coefficient helps more to understand the flow the drag coefficient of a body can be calculated according to eq 1 as can be seen below 1 c d f d 1 2 ρ u d 2 where fd is drag force ρ is the fluid density u is the average fluid velocity d is cylinder diameter the distribution of tke and the fluctuating normalized stress of reynolds can be observed u u and v v in order to investigate the dynamics of the vortical structure the value of tke streamwise reynolds normal stress u u and spanwise reynolds normal stress v v are non dimensionalized by dividing them by the free stream velocity square during the experiment piv laser was positioned above the channel and the mirror was positioned with 45 angle to the channel surface for laser beam and camera perpendicular to each other in order to decrease the boundary effect of the channel walls the laser sheet was positioned in the middle of the cylinders in terms of spanwise direction instant vector images were obtained with the help of piv and could be interpreted the measurements were done using the piv technique the piv technique was used to evaluate instant velocity vectors in the laser lighted zone the dantec piv system had been used to measure velocity vectors flow field lighting provided using two nd assets 120 mj yag energy efficiency 532 nm wavelength laser effect dantec dynamics which was responsible for managing data acquisition was used to support the reception and laser viewing unit images were taken by using an 8 bit cross correlation charge coupled device ccd camera with 1600 pixels x 1200 pixels resolution and accoutered with a nikon af micro 60 f 2 8 d lenses the raw displacement vectors were indicated by utilizing cross correlation algorithm with refinement steps from a first integration window area 128 x128 pixels to a last integration window area 32 x 32 pixels all 7326 pixels 99 x 74 velocity vectors were achieved in order to detect an instantaneous velocity field with an effective grid size of 1 77 mm 1 77 mm 1750 μs and about 2 mm were the time interval between the laser sheet thickness and pulses enlightening the measurement plane respectively in the post processing bad vectors were revised utilizing interpolations among surrounding vectors velocity vectors were computed by the displacement vector area the raw velocity vectors were calculated from the displacement of raw vectors using the time interval pulses by employing central difference scheme circulation and streamlines were acquired using the velocity data the total area of the image was 180 60 mm2 while patterns of instantaneous particle views total 1000 views were obtained at a rate of 15 hz throughout the integration step vertical and horizontal overlaps of 50 were implemented erroneous vectors owing to shadow and reflection of laser sheet were identified by utilizing local median filter method and then they were changed with vectors calculated using local interpolation of surrounding vectors applying a bilinear least squares fit technique furthermore velocity vector maps were smoothed using gaussian smoothing technique to avoid distinct changes in the flow fields the accuracy of the experiment was obtained by about 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 particle image velocimetry piv experiment in this section the results obtained from the piv experiment are presented fig 3 displays flow structure the downstream of the bare cylinder flow characteristics with the inclusion of reynolds stress uv u2 time averaged velocity vectors v and the corresponding streamline topology ѱ are showed in fig 3 reynolds stress uv u2 shows in fig 3 in the first column as can see in this column however both negative and positive counter occurs all height at the cylinder there is only a positive counter appears at h 0 mm due to the influence of the surface effect when comparing all heights for bare cylinder at first column the maximum negative width and length counter forms at h 37 5 mm velocity vectors v showed in the second column for this visual low velocity vector occur downstream of the cylinders except for h 52 5 mm and h 60 mm more high velocity vector observed just around the cylinders furthermore at the bottom of the experimental area at h 22 5 mm it s observed that there are more intensive velocity vectors among other test sections foci f and saddle point s junction of the streamlines are illustrated in the third column in fig 3 time average streamline topology ѱ in fig 3 symmetry is obvious at both sides around the cylinder downstream which consistent with the study of canpolat 2015 also two foci point is observed at h 15 mm 22 5 mm 30 mm 37 5 mm 45 mm and 52 5 mm due to the shear layer at the upper side of the cylinder although the second foci point is not seen at h 60 mm it can be predicted to occur later on the other hand swirl could be taking place at h 0 mm according to the visual the biggest wake region is observed h 52 5 mm furthermore comparing h 45 mm and h 52 5 mm the wake region enlarges in the longitudinal direction at h 52 5 mm for this reason the saddle point occurs later on the other hand this region enlarges in the transverse direction at h 45 mm compare with f of h 45 mm f enlarges in the transverse direction at h 52 5 mm moreover it is observed that the wake region shrinks in the transverse direction at h 15 mm 22 5 mm 30 mm and 37 5 mm among these heights the largest wake region was seen at h 22 5 mm also at h 0 mm and 60 mm wake regions occur later from other height due to shear layers fig 4 illustrates the flow structure in the downstream of the triangular grooved and bare cylinders at h 0 mm also triangular grooved cylinders rotate clockwise direction with a 0 80 85 90 and 95 respectively at first column in fig 4 the biggest negative counter is observed at the situation of the 90 only a positive counter occurred near the cylinders is seen at the bare cylinder and a 0 while the negative counter is observed 3d 2 distance from the cylinder at a 80 90 and d 2 distance from the cylinder at a 85 and 95 furthermore since separation taking place where groove at the cylinder as the angle is chanced separation occurs far behind of the flow the density of the velocity vectors appears to be fast at the point where the flow break occurs on the upper surface of the cylinder at the second column moreover it is observed that the velocity vector behind the cylinders like the second column in fig 3 according to the third column in fig 4 swirl could be taking place at a 0 like a bare cylinder moreover it is observed wake region occurs after a 0 there is two foci point and saddle point in four angles a 80 and 90 compared to a 85 and 95 it can be seen that the vortex starting point is far behind from a 85 and 95 saddle points occur approximately 3d after the cylinder effect of the groove angle position does not cause any discernable difference in the positions of saddle and foci point at h 0 mm a 80 85 90 and 95 except for bare and h 0 mm a 0 fig 5 illustrates bare and situation h 15 mm grooved cylinder experiments with a different angle as can be seen in the first column in this fig reynolds stress occurs different configurations from h 0 mm it can be predicted that the reason for this phenomenon is the bottom effect at the a 0 and 95 the positive counter exhibits constant flow while at the 80 85 and 90 fragile occur at the positive column furthermore the negative and positive column at all bare cylinders occurs near the cylinders on the other hand at bare cylinders these counters are carried away from the cylinder also it has been observed that the velocity vectors take place just behind the cylinder while the bare cylinder is further back it can be undoubtedly seen that there is saddle and foci point in last column for all heights comparing the results of the experiment as shown in fig 5 the wake region is the closest to the cylinder where a 0 in fig 5 at h 15 mm a 0 80 85 and 95 saddle and foci points form very closely position approximately 3d after the cylinder but saddle point forms earlier than other angles at h 15 mm a 90 it is seen that at the first column negative counters occur almost the same size in all cylinders in fig 6 on the other hand positive counter the cylinders at other angles are thinner than the bare cylinder and at a 0 it is observed there are velocity vectors around cylinders like other height but not seen at a 0 in h 22 5 mm furthermore f and s observe all angles and bare cylinder in fig 7 at h 30 mm means that the center of the cylinder corresponds to the center of the water height compare bare and grooved cylinders at the first column although the positive counter at bare cylinder occurs further in the cylinder it is formed closer to the cylinder in the grooved velocity vectors v showed the second column illustrate the low velocity region which represents the wake region just downstream of the cylinders this means that velocity vectors are slow in the rear flow zone of the cylinder wake regions occur symmetrically in the last column moreover it is not seen as a big difference between the wake regions are for all angles both in figs 6 and 7 saddle point and foci point form very closely position approximately 3d after the cylinder at h 22 5 mm and 30 mm a 0 80 85 90 and 95 in fig 8 a positive counter in a bare cylinder takes up more space than grooved cylinders also compared to other height negative contours have the largest and longest area at the first column in fig 8 velocity vectors presenting in the second column show a low velocity region which represents the wake region which represents the wake region downstream of the cylinders like other heights besides some velocity vectors occur backward of the cylinders expect angle of zero foci point can be seen in the last column in this visual and saddle point forms earlier at h 37 5 mm a 0 80 85 and 95 mm except for a 90 both negative and positive counters occurred at h 45 mm for all angles in fig 9 velocity vectors are observed at the same density and the same location behind the cylinders at a 80 85 90 and 95 no vector condensing in the back cylinder flow region at a 0 furthermore in the flow region behind the cylinder the most velocity vector is seen in the bare cylinder saddle point and foci point form very closely position approximately 3d after the cylinder at h 45 mm grooved cylinders but there is not observed saddle point at bare cylinder in fig 10 both negative and positive counters occurred for all angles at h 52 5 mm in the bare cylinder there are no velocity vectors back of the cylinder these vectors occur after the a 0 besides velocity vectors are observed at the back of the cylinder at a 95 intensely the last column shows streamline vectors and two foci point is observed for all angles also saddle point could have occurred back of the cylinder fig 11 illustrates grooved and bare cylinders with the angle from 0 to 95 at h 60 mm it is observed that in this fig at the bare cylinder in the first column positive and negative counters are seen clearly on the other hand there is the only negative counter in grooved cylinders also unlike other heights velocity vectors are observed to concentrate on the surface of the water except for the 0 in the last column it can be seen a big difference from other columns only one foci point is seen h 60 mm at a 0 85 95 and bare cylinder on the other hand the foci point is not fully formed at a 80 and 90 thus it is observed from the experiment that the groove in the cylinder shrink in the transverse direction of the wake region moreover the largest wake region occurs in the bare cylinder in the transverse direction there is not observed saddle point for h 52 5 mm and 60 mm when the wake length behind the cylinder compares for bare cylinder the longest wake length was observed in h 52 5 mm as higher than 2 90d the shortest wake length was observed in h 45 mm as 1 25d the wake lengths of the bare cylinders for all heights can be seen in table 1 when the wake length behind the cylinder compare for grooved cylinder the longest wake length was observed in h 52 5 mm and all angles as higher than 2 50d the shortest wake length was observed in h 37 5 mm a 85 as 1 10d the wake lengths of the grooved cylinder for all heights and angles can be seen in table 2 3 2 drag coefficient cd calculation in this section cd values are calculated numerically about 2d away from the cylinder in order to obtain optimum results which are consistent with the study of son and cetiner 2015 as can be seen in literature it is observed that the drag coefficient value in the smooth body was lower than the rough surface at high reynolds number like the study of choi et al 2008 in addition in this study it is observed that drag values are lower in the bare cylinder also as reynolds number increases cd values decrease from h 0 mm 30 mm at bare cylinder with the accordance literature wen et al 2004 on the other hand cd values increase between h 30 mm and h 37 5 mm and then decrease the lowest cd h 52 5 mm occurred with the value of 0 742597 when the bare cylinder cd values are investigated in table 3 on the other hand the highest cd h 37 5 mm occurred with a value of 0 742597 it is also noted that the results obtained are closely related furthermore at the triangular grooved cylinder the lowest cd is 0 82828 with h 37 5 mm a 80 while the highest cd h 0 mm a 90 is 1 42443 as can be seen from table 4 also when the bare and triangular groove cylinders are compared in fig 12 the lowest cd value is observed in the bare cylinder at h 22 5 mm 3 3 turbulent kinetic energy tke results the value of tke streamwise reynolds stress and spanwise as can be seen in fig 13 the maximum tke at the bare cylinder is h 37 5 mm and the smallest tke is a 0 which is the triangular grooved cylinder of the same height also the tke increased from h 0 mm 37 5 mm and decreased after h 37 5 mm as a result while the highest tke value is observed at bare cylinder h 37 5 mm the tke values decrease as the cylinder groove angle is rotated counterclockwise direction because of the lack of surface effect the highest tke values are seen around the center of the water 4 3 4 strouhal number st results the values of st for bare and triangular grooved cylinder for all heights and angles can be seen in tables 5 6 for bare cylinder the highest st value occurs in h 15 mm because of the surface effect in h 60 mm the highest st value is seen for a 95 triangular grooved cylinder when all cylinders are compared the minimum value of the st is observed as 0 01 4 conclusion in order to control the fluid characteristic around cylinders a triangular grooved cylinder and bare cylinder were compared for the piv experiment the experiments were conducted under shallow water conditions hw 90 mm one of the cylinders used in the experiments was a triangular shape grooved cylinder and the other was a bare cylinder with no groove besides the cylinders were positioned at h 0 mm 15 mm 22 5 mm 30 mm 37 5 mm 45 mm 52 5 mm and 60 mm from bottom to surface with the a 0 80 85 90 and 95 in shallow water also re number and fr number were selected as 5000 and 0 27 respectively according to the outcomes of the experiment when reynolds stress was compared between the bare cylinder and triangular grooved cylinders the highest negative counter occurred at h 37 5 mm at h 0 bare and h a 0 the only positive counter was observed due to surface effect furthermore at h 60 mm from a 0 to a 95 the only negative counter occurred also it seemed to streamline topology saddle and foci point was not seen at h 0 mm bare cylinder h 0 mm a 0 h 60 mm a 80 and a 90 the biggest wake region area was observed h 52 5 mm the vortex ruptured also varied with the groove angles the lowest cd value was h 22 5 mm in the bare cylinder whereas the maximum cd h 0 mm a 90 was 1 42443 the maximum tke with a bare cylinder was 37 5 mm and the smallest tke is a 0 which was the same height triangular grooved cylinder the tke increased further from h 0 mm to h 37 5 mm and decreased after h 37 5 mm credit authorship contribution statement meltem caliskan investigation validation writing original draft atakan tantekin

20943,this study is an investigation and comparison of the flow characteristic around triangular grooved and bare cylinders positioned horizontally in shallow water using particle image velocimetry piv throughout the experiment reynolds number froude number and water height have been selected as 5000 0 27 and 90 mm respectively to observe the effect of height h on the flow structure cylinder is positioned at h 0 mm 15 mm 22 5 mm 30 mm 37 5 mm 45 mm 52 5 mm and 60 mm moreover grooved angle a has been changed from 0 80 85 90 and 95 in shallow water to investigate the effect of grooved angle the results show that the vortex forms vary according to the groove angle it is seen that the vortex the cylinders especially positioned at h 0 mm and h 60 mm are affected owing to the surface and bottom effect furthermore the largest reynolds stress is observed at the h 37 5 mm while the largest wake region is observed at the h 52 5 mm also the maximum drag coefficient cd and turbulence kinetic energy tke are observed at h 0 mm a 90 for grooved cylinder and at h 37 5 mm for bare cylinder respectively keywords drag coefficient grooved cylinder turbulence kinetic energy particle image velocimetry dye experiment 1 introduction in the environment many objects are seen in the flow affected by the fluid this flow creates non permanent loads both on the body and behind the body these loads and vibrations cause fatigue in the body besides these vortices affect the environmental factors especially in shallow water applications resulting in erosion in streams and rivers and transport of particles and pollution at the bottom in order to prevent the problems caused by the vortex structure formed behind an object placed in the flow it is necessary to control the non permanent flow structure and to reduce the turbulence intensity in the region behind the body in general control methods in the flow around an object are divided into two categories these are active and passive control methods active control is affected by the outside in passive control there is no external energy supply to change the flow structure we could see some major examples about flow control in literature as can be seen below yagmur et al 2017 examined a triangular cylinder with the different reynolds numbers and results were compared by using particle image velocimetry and large eddy simulation methods the data obtained as a result of this experiment were as follows as the reynolds numbers were increased the cd decreased however the power spectral density psd and the vortex shedding frequency increased for the same reynolds numbers the experimental and numerical results were consistent sooraj et al 2019 studied an investigation about three vertical arranged cylinders for the ratio of the distance between the cylinders s and the diameter of the cylinders d the interface of the inner shear layers formed between the cylinders was greater compared to the interaction between the shear layers formed around a roll for lower void rates this means that according to the experiment flow characteristics and cd were affected by different reynolds number and gap ratio ozdil and akilli 2019 showed single and dual cylinders positioned parallel to the channel bottom the cylinder is located at different levels during the experiments to examine the effect of the gap on flow characteristics the dimension of the wake area rises as the space between tandem cylinders deepens ozdil and akilli 2015 demonstrated flow characteristics around the horizontal cylinder this cylinder was positioned as a different immersion ratio as this ratio was increased from 0 25 to 1 the jet like flow velocity was increased after ratio1 values had changed oruç et al 2016 investigated bare and drop shaped mesh cylinders using the piv method with passive control at this experiment reynolds numbers were determined with different parameters it was substantially vortexes on a large scale in the downstream direction of the bare cylinder to make flow control they shaped cylinders as drop mesh they managed large scale vortical flow structure vorticity layers reynolds shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy as a result of this study the flow structure was controlled successfully oruc 2012 studied both bare cylinders and streamline shaped cylinders it was observed that flow was controlled with a shaped cylinder in comparison with the bare cylinder at their experiment results flow more controlled at shaped cylinders when it was compared cylinder shape and l d ratio effect on the flow characteristic canpolat and sahin 2017 investigated square grooved cylinder was positioned at different groove angles in the water by using piv method according to this experiment it was observed that the critical angle was 80 since flow separation started and occurred vorticity karman vortex etc at this angle the flow characteristic of hole circular cylinders was investigated by durhasan et al 2018 moreover the piv method was used at this experiment and cylinder diameter and reynolds number was in the experiment it was aimed to control vortex by changing the hole in different range as a result of these phenomena as the hole was increased the wake region decreased due to elongated and fragmented shear layers and reduced magnitudes of vortices zhou et al 2015 aimed to show flow characteristics with smooth grooved and dimpled cylinders using a piezo electric load cell and piv the experiment was carried out on the open channel towing tang according to the result of the experiment the flow was more controlled at grooved and dimpled than the smooth cylinder yayla and teksin 2018 the flow structures behind the flexible separating plate attached to a circular cylinder and the post flow wake were examined qualitatively and quantitatively in three different reynolds numbers in deep water as a result of concluded that the flexible separation plate was found to have a significant effect in vortex pouring and the fluctuations are significantly attenuated using control material liu and shi 2011 used cacti shaped and smooth surfaces cylinder by using piv method in order to understand the wake characteristic of the cylinders it had been observed that small vortices superimposed on the slicing layers behind the grooved cylinder were developed and transported downstream in the same phase as a result a drastic reduction in vortex force on the roller surface was observed canpolat 2015 studied the flow structure flowing over different rectangular groove shaped cylinder positioned at different angles using the piv method it was concluded that the position of the groove on the surface of the cylinder had an effect on the function of the wake flow structure the frequency of karman vortex shedding depended greatly on the groove size finally shear layer instability with external frequencies was induced on the grooved side rinoshika and rinoshika 2019 studied a front inclined hole on flow structures around a surface mounted short cylinder compared with standard cylinder with inclined hole the separation region along the free end surface is observed to decline and the rear separation increases in the recirculation region vortex and reynolds shear stresses were also suppressed pinar et al 2015 studied cylinder perforated with different hole sizes using the piv method to learn more about the flow characteristics the cutting layer was extended fluctuations were considerably decreased and karman vortex was impeded successfully using porosity cylinders najafi et al 2016 studied different angles of divergence about close to the cylinder the time average flow configuration using piv and dye experiment a bipolar pattern with close vigilance was observed as the flow pattern and deviation angle changed gozmen et al 2013 examined bare and different sizes separating platforms to investigate the vortex discharge of a circular cylinder in shallow water by piv method reynolds stress was shown to be significantly reduced in the bare cylinder fırat et al 2015 examined the flow structure of the cylinder and the square prism placed behind it at different distances and different angles as numeric the efficacy of the control rod in minimizing the time averaged drag coefficient of the total system was decreased with an increased angle karasu 2020 researched flow regulation over a diamond shaped cylinder utilizing piv slits experimentally the results suggest that the use of slits could be an efficient passive control strategy for diamond shaped cylinders kahraman et al 2012 studied horizontal cylinder with different cylinder diameter reynolds number and froude number using piv method as cylinder diameter was increased vorticity intensity reynolds stress correlations and the primary recirculating bubble lengths increase gao et al 2018 examined the flow activity of the clockwise and counter clockwise rotating cylinder clockwise and counterclockwise rotation created major wake effects and altered the wake flow mechanisms and vortex shedding patterns the time averaged streamline models tended to be non symmetrical about the longitudinal flow axis narayanan et al 2018 studied on elastic filament attached to a circular cylinder under uniform flow their study was carried out for different wall proximities and gap ratios numerically as a result of their study with lower gap ratios of 0 5 and 0 6 flapping amplitude modulations were found moreover the frequency of flaps was in conjunction with the shedding frequency in their study wang et al 2015 performed a study to investigate the movement of two tandem cylinders near and parallel to the plane wall using piv method the reynolds number was selected in 6300 the other parameters were spacing ratio and gap to cylinder diameter ratio the cylinder center to center spacing ratio was changing from 1 5 to 6 and the gap height to cylinder diameter ratio from 0 15 to 2 they observed that vortex shedding suppressed according to with cylinders position as a result yang et al 2018 investigated an experimental study about the pressure distribution and the hydrodynamic forces on a cylinder placed near a plane boundary at various reynolds numbers and g d ratios where g was the distance between cylinder and ground of the channel according to this study the drag coefficient at smaller g d ratios decreased examined a numerical study about flow characteristics of circular diamond and square cross sectional cylinders to reveal the wall proximity effects the study was carried out in a 2d domain with the finite volume discretization method for re 20000 and unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with spalart allmaras turbulence model was used according to the results for the same g d ratio the highest st was observed in a circular cylinder although shedding frequencies increased as the g d ratio increased for all types of cylinders shi et al 2010 investigated an experimental study for wall proximity on flow characteristics on a 2d square cylinder with piv and tr piv methods reynolds number was selected as 2250 and g d ratios were selected as 0 1 0 2 0 4 and 0 8 furthermore the proper orthogonal decomposition pod method was used to decompose the tr piv results according to the results the slight spatial asymmetry of the two time mean recirculation zones was observed for the g d 0 8 and 0 4 with vortex shedding moreover with the reduction of g d from 0 2 to 0 1 vortex shedding was suppressed and a large separation bubble was attached to the wall gozmen et al 2013 performed an experimental study about flow characteristics over a circular cylinder in the vicinity of a flat plate using piv method the cylinder was located above the flat plate with its axis parallel to the wall and normal to the flow direction the reynolds number was selected as 1072 and the g d ratios were varied from 0 to 3 the results showed that when the g d 2 the cylinder wake observed asymmetric and a boundary layer separation was induced on the flat plate downstream of the cylinder furthermore with the decreasing g d until the critical gap ratio as 0 25 the wake vortex shedding frequency increased oner et al 2008 examined the velocity field in a steady 2d turbulent flow around a horizontal circular cylinder near a plane boundary with piv technique g d ratios were selected as 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 6 1 and 2 reynolds numbers were selected as 840 4150 and 9500 the results indicated that the changes in the flow structure become very slow as g d 0 3 and the wall proximity effect on the flow around the cylinder become significant as g d 1 zhou et al 2015 examined the velocity field of 2d turbulent flow around a partially buried circular cylinder on a smooth plane boundary with piv technique the experiments were conducted for re 1000 3000 5000 and 7000 b d ratios where b was the burial ratio were selected as 0 25 and 0 5 the results showed that the separation points on the cylinder surface and the length of the separation region upstream and downstream of the cylinder were strongly dependent on the b d ratio and re number the location of boundary separation on the cylinder moved further upstream for higher re numbers and it shifted in downstream direction with the increment of b d ratio it is very little distance between the bottom of the fluid and the upper of the fluid in the shallow water this makes the fluid more complicated than deep waters however there are not enough studies on shallow water in the literature it is aimed to control formed non permanent flow on the back of a cylinder positioned at different height geometries and angles at the shallow water passively in this study as a result this study can fill the shallow water research gap in the literature 2 materials and methods this study was performed at çukurova university department of mechanical engineering a closed water duct installed in the fluid mechanics laboratory the water canal consists of two pieces of storage and an acrylic section between these two warehouses with dimensions 8000x1000 750 mm length x width x height the test area scale used for piv was 142 4 106 8 mm length x width the speed of the water in the channel was adjusted by a pump operating at different speeds with the help of a speed control unit two different shape cylinders made of polyoxymethylene material which had 30 mm diameter were used in this experiment as triangular groove shape cylinder and bare cylinder the schematic representation of the models can be seen in fig 1 the cylinder has a groove which is triangular shape as a circular sector since the triangular groove is equilateral its interior angles are equal and 60 the height of the groove is 3 mm the boundary layer thickness is calculated as δ 34 77 mm for the distance of x 1250 mm from the beginning of test area to cylinders the triangular groove shape cylinder was rotated at a 0 80 85 90 and 95 at the clockwise direction the flow direction of the water was zero moreover cylinders were positioned at h 0 mm 15 mm 22 5 mm 30 mm 37 5 mm 45 mm 52 5 mm and 60 mm from the bottom of the water to upwards respectively the water height was kept constant at hw 90 mm as well as reynolds number and froude number are 5000 and 0 27 respectively the calculated froude number is below from critical froude number fr 1 which means the results were valid for subcritical regimes the experimental setup was demonstrated in fig 2 furthermore the cylinders were located 4000 mm away from the start of the channel in order to obtain fully developed flow during the experiment due to the special design of the canal and honeycomb the turbulence intensity of the canal is less than 0 4 the drag coefficient is the dimensionless quantity used to calculate the friction or resistance of an entity in a fluid setting such as air or water for this reason drag coefficient is a crucial parameter and examining drag coefficient helps more to understand the flow the drag coefficient of a body can be calculated according to eq 1 as can be seen below 1 c d f d 1 2 ρ u d 2 where fd is drag force ρ is the fluid density u is the average fluid velocity d is cylinder diameter the distribution of tke and the fluctuating normalized stress of reynolds can be observed u u and v v in order to investigate the dynamics of the vortical structure the value of tke streamwise reynolds normal stress u u and spanwise reynolds normal stress v v are non dimensionalized by dividing them by the free stream velocity square during the experiment piv laser was positioned above the channel and the mirror was positioned with 45 angle to the channel surface for laser beam and camera perpendicular to each other in order to decrease the boundary effect of the channel walls the laser sheet was positioned in the middle of the cylinders in terms of spanwise direction instant vector images were obtained with the help of piv and could be interpreted the measurements were done using the piv technique the piv technique was used to evaluate instant velocity vectors in the laser lighted zone the dantec piv system had been used to measure velocity vectors flow field lighting provided using two nd assets 120 mj yag energy efficiency 532 nm wavelength laser effect dantec dynamics which was responsible for managing data acquisition was used to support the reception and laser viewing unit images were taken by using an 8 bit cross correlation charge coupled device ccd camera with 1600 pixels x 1200 pixels resolution and accoutered with a nikon af micro 60 f 2 8 d lenses the raw displacement vectors were indicated by utilizing cross correlation algorithm with refinement steps from a first integration window area 128 x128 pixels to a last integration window area 32 x 32 pixels all 7326 pixels 99 x 74 velocity vectors were achieved in order to detect an instantaneous velocity field with an effective grid size of 1 77 mm 1 77 mm 1750 μs and about 2 mm were the time interval between the laser sheet thickness and pulses enlightening the measurement plane respectively in the post processing bad vectors were revised utilizing interpolations among surrounding vectors velocity vectors were computed by the displacement vector area the raw velocity vectors were calculated from the displacement of raw vectors using the time interval pulses by employing central difference scheme circulation and streamlines were acquired using the velocity data the total area of the image was 180 60 mm2 while patterns of instantaneous particle views total 1000 views were obtained at a rate of 15 hz throughout the integration step vertical and horizontal overlaps of 50 were implemented erroneous vectors owing to shadow and reflection of laser sheet were identified by utilizing local median filter method and then they were changed with vectors calculated using local interpolation of surrounding vectors applying a bilinear least squares fit technique furthermore velocity vector maps were smoothed using gaussian smoothing technique to avoid distinct changes in the flow fields the accuracy of the experiment was obtained by about 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 particle image velocimetry piv experiment in this section the results obtained from the piv experiment are presented fig 3 displays flow structure the downstream of the bare cylinder flow characteristics with the inclusion of reynolds stress uv u2 time averaged velocity vectors v and the corresponding streamline topology ѱ are showed in fig 3 reynolds stress uv u2 shows in fig 3 in the first column as can see in this column however both negative and positive counter occurs all height at the cylinder there is only a positive counter appears at h 0 mm due to the influence of the surface effect when comparing all heights for bare cylinder at first column the maximum negative width and length counter forms at h 37 5 mm velocity vectors v showed in the second column for this visual low velocity vector occur downstream of the cylinders except for h 52 5 mm and h 60 mm more high velocity vector observed just around the cylinders furthermore at the bottom of the experimental area at h 22 5 mm it s observed that there are more intensive velocity vectors among other test sections foci f and saddle point s junction of the streamlines are illustrated in the third column in fig 3 time average streamline topology ѱ in fig 3 symmetry is obvious at both sides around the cylinder downstream which consistent with the study of canpolat 2015 also two foci point is observed at h 15 mm 22 5 mm 30 mm 37 5 mm 45 mm and 52 5 mm due to the shear layer at the upper side of the cylinder although the second foci point is not seen at h 60 mm it can be predicted to occur later on the other hand swirl could be taking place at h 0 mm according to the visual the biggest wake region is observed h 52 5 mm furthermore comparing h 45 mm and h 52 5 mm the wake region enlarges in the longitudinal direction at h 52 5 mm for this reason the saddle point occurs later on the other hand this region enlarges in the transverse direction at h 45 mm compare with f of h 45 mm f enlarges in the transverse direction at h 52 5 mm moreover it is observed that the wake region shrinks in the transverse direction at h 15 mm 22 5 mm 30 mm and 37 5 mm among these heights the largest wake region was seen at h 22 5 mm also at h 0 mm and 60 mm wake regions occur later from other height due to shear layers fig 4 illustrates the flow structure in the downstream of the triangular grooved and bare cylinders at h 0 mm also triangular grooved cylinders rotate clockwise direction with a 0 80 85 90 and 95 respectively at first column in fig 4 the biggest negative counter is observed at the situation of the 90 only a positive counter occurred near the cylinders is seen at the bare cylinder and a 0 while the negative counter is observed 3d 2 distance from the cylinder at a 80 90 and d 2 distance from the cylinder at a 85 and 95 furthermore since separation taking place where groove at the cylinder as the angle is chanced separation occurs far behind of the flow the density of the velocity vectors appears to be fast at the point where the flow break occurs on the upper surface of the cylinder at the second column moreover it is observed that the velocity vector behind the cylinders like the second column in fig 3 according to the third column in fig 4 swirl could be taking place at a 0 like a bare cylinder moreover it is observed wake region occurs after a 0 there is two foci point and saddle point in four angles a 80 and 90 compared to a 85 and 95 it can be seen that the vortex starting point is far behind from a 85 and 95 saddle points occur approximately 3d after the cylinder effect of the groove angle position does not cause any discernable difference in the positions of saddle and foci point at h 0 mm a 80 85 90 and 95 except for bare and h 0 mm a 0 fig 5 illustrates bare and situation h 15 mm grooved cylinder experiments with a different angle as can be seen in the first column in this fig reynolds stress occurs different configurations from h 0 mm it can be predicted that the reason for this phenomenon is the bottom effect at the a 0 and 95 the positive counter exhibits constant flow while at the 80 85 and 90 fragile occur at the positive column furthermore the negative and positive column at all bare cylinders occurs near the cylinders on the other hand at bare cylinders these counters are carried away from the cylinder also it has been observed that the velocity vectors take place just behind the cylinder while the bare cylinder is further back it can be undoubtedly seen that there is saddle and foci point in last column for all heights comparing the results of the experiment as shown in fig 5 the wake region is the closest to the cylinder where a 0 in fig 5 at h 15 mm a 0 80 85 and 95 saddle and foci points form very closely position approximately 3d after the cylinder but saddle point forms earlier than other angles at h 15 mm a 90 it is seen that at the first column negative counters occur almost the same size in all cylinders in fig 6 on the other hand positive counter the cylinders at other angles are thinner than the bare cylinder and at a 0 it is observed there are velocity vectors around cylinders like other height but not seen at a 0 in h 22 5 mm furthermore f and s observe all angles and bare cylinder in fig 7 at h 30 mm means that the center of the cylinder corresponds to the center of the water height compare bare and grooved cylinders at the first column although the positive counter at bare cylinder occurs further in the cylinder it is formed closer to the cylinder in the grooved velocity vectors v showed the second column illustrate the low velocity region which represents the wake region just downstream of the cylinders this means that velocity vectors are slow in the rear flow zone of the cylinder wake regions occur symmetrically in the last column moreover it is not seen as a big difference between the wake regions are for all angles both in figs 6 and 7 saddle point and foci point form very closely position approximately 3d after the cylinder at h 22 5 mm and 30 mm a 0 80 85 90 and 95 in fig 8 a positive counter in a bare cylinder takes up more space than grooved cylinders also compared to other height negative contours have the largest and longest area at the first column in fig 8 velocity vectors presenting in the second column show a low velocity region which represents the wake region which represents the wake region downstream of the cylinders like other heights besides some velocity vectors occur backward of the cylinders expect angle of zero foci point can be seen in the last column in this visual and saddle point forms earlier at h 37 5 mm a 0 80 85 and 95 mm except for a 90 both negative and positive counters occurred at h 45 mm for all angles in fig 9 velocity vectors are observed at the same density and the same location behind the cylinders at a 80 85 90 and 95 no vector condensing in the back cylinder flow region at a 0 furthermore in the flow region behind the cylinder the most velocity vector is seen in the bare cylinder saddle point and foci point form very closely position approximately 3d after the cylinder at h 45 mm grooved cylinders but there is not observed saddle point at bare cylinder in fig 10 both negative and positive counters occurred for all angles at h 52 5 mm in the bare cylinder there are no velocity vectors back of the cylinder these vectors occur after the a 0 besides velocity vectors are observed at the back of the cylinder at a 95 intensely the last column shows streamline vectors and two foci point is observed for all angles also saddle point could have occurred back of the cylinder fig 11 illustrates grooved and bare cylinders with the angle from 0 to 95 at h 60 mm it is observed that in this fig at the bare cylinder in the first column positive and negative counters are seen clearly on the other hand there is the only negative counter in grooved cylinders also unlike other heights velocity vectors are observed to concentrate on the surface of the water except for the 0 in the last column it can be seen a big difference from other columns only one foci point is seen h 60 mm at a 0 85 95 and bare cylinder on the other hand the foci point is not fully formed at a 80 and 90 thus it is observed from the experiment that the groove in the cylinder shrink in the transverse direction of the wake region moreover the largest wake region occurs in the bare cylinder in the transverse direction there is not observed saddle point for h 52 5 mm and 60 mm when the wake length behind the cylinder compares for bare cylinder the longest wake length was observed in h 52 5 mm as higher than 2 90d the shortest wake length was observed in h 45 mm as 1 25d the wake lengths of the bare cylinders for all heights can be seen in table 1 when the wake length behind the cylinder compare for grooved cylinder the longest wake length was observed in h 52 5 mm and all angles as higher than 2 50d the shortest wake length was observed in h 37 5 mm a 85 as 1 10d the wake lengths of the grooved cylinder for all heights and angles can be seen in table 2 3 2 drag coefficient cd calculation in this section cd values are calculated numerically about 2d away from the cylinder in order to obtain optimum results which are consistent with the study of son and cetiner 2015 as can be seen in literature it is observed that the drag coefficient value in the smooth body was lower than the rough surface at high reynolds number like the study of choi et al 2008 in addition in this study it is observed that drag values are lower in the bare cylinder also as reynolds number increases cd values decrease from h 0 mm 30 mm at bare cylinder with the accordance literature wen et al 2004 on the other hand cd values increase between h 30 mm and h 37 5 mm and then decrease the lowest cd h 52 5 mm occurred with the value of 0 742597 when the bare cylinder cd values are investigated in table 3 on the other hand the highest cd h 37 5 mm occurred with a value of 0 742597 it is also noted that the results obtained are closely related furthermore at the triangular grooved cylinder the lowest cd is 0 82828 with h 37 5 mm a 80 while the highest cd h 0 mm a 90 is 1 42443 as can be seen from table 4 also when the bare and triangular groove cylinders are compared in fig 12 the lowest cd value is observed in the bare cylinder at h 22 5 mm 3 3 turbulent kinetic energy tke results the value of tke streamwise reynolds stress and spanwise as can be seen in fig 13 the maximum tke at the bare cylinder is h 37 5 mm and the smallest tke is a 0 which is the triangular grooved cylinder of the same height also the tke increased from h 0 mm 37 5 mm and decreased after h 37 5 mm as a result while the highest tke value is observed at bare cylinder h 37 5 mm the tke values decrease as the cylinder groove angle is rotated counterclockwise direction because of the lack of surface effect the highest tke values are seen around the center of the water 4 3 4 strouhal number st results the values of st for bare and triangular grooved cylinder for all heights and angles can be seen in tables 5 6 for bare cylinder the highest st value occurs in h 15 mm because of the surface effect in h 60 mm the highest st value is seen for a 95 triangular grooved cylinder when all cylinders are compared the minimum value of the st is observed as 0 01 4 conclusion in order to control the fluid characteristic around cylinders a triangular grooved cylinder and bare cylinder were compared for the piv experiment the experiments were conducted under shallow water conditions hw 90 mm one of the cylinders used in the experiments was a triangular shape grooved cylinder and the other was a bare cylinder with no groove besides the cylinders were positioned at h 0 mm 15 mm 22 5 mm 30 mm 37 5 mm 45 mm 52 5 mm and 60 mm from bottom to surface with the a 0 80 85 90 and 95 in shallow water also re number and fr number were selected as 5000 and 0 27 respectively according to the outcomes of the experiment when reynolds stress was compared between the bare cylinder and triangular grooved cylinders the highest negative counter occurred at h 37 5 mm at h 0 bare and h a 0 the only positive counter was observed due to surface effect furthermore at h 60 mm from a 0 to a 95 the only negative counter occurred also it seemed to streamline topology saddle and foci point was not seen at h 0 mm bare cylinder h 0 mm a 0 h 60 mm a 80 and a 90 the biggest wake region area was observed h 52 5 mm the vortex ruptured also varied with the groove angles the lowest cd value was h 22 5 mm in the bare cylinder whereas the maximum cd h 0 mm a 90 was 1 42443 the maximum tke with a bare cylinder was 37 5 mm and the smallest tke is a 0 which was the same height triangular grooved cylinder the tke increased further from h 0 mm to h 37 5 mm and decreased after h 37 5 mm credit authorship contribution statement meltem caliskan investigation validation writing original draft atakan tantekin

20944,the intense maritime traffic of modern days requires that a considerable attention be paid toward the comfort of ships not only as design criteria but also as a means of assessing the quality of navigation in service conditions certain passenger routes and ship dimensions are more vulnerable than others to rough weather and the current climate changes require adaptation of design and navigation warning strategies the main aim of the paper is to describe a method to derive a probabilistic representation of the comfort of passengers and crew on a selected route ais data is used to identify and characterise the chosen route the seakeeping properties of the principal ships are evaluated employing a strip theory code detailed wave hindcast data is then employed to build state of the art wave scatter diagrams along the route which allow the calculation of the ship responses for each sea state and the associated probability the motion sickness incidence is finally used as a comparative measure of the overall on board comfort experienced on a variety of passenger vessels keywords msi route comfort probability ais seakeeping wave scatter diagrams 1 introduction the relentless expansion of the maritime trade has led the worldwide shipping traffic volume to quadruplicate over a period of 50 years reaching an estimated 11 billion tons in 2018 unctad 2018 in 2019 the ligurian and north tyrrhenian seas in the mediterranean sea absorbed together about 0 2 of the almost 0 5 billion cargo tons handled by the italian ports srm assoporti 2019 which is estimated to be about 14 of the eu total freight traffic eurostat 2020 the statistics are even higher for ferry and cruise shipping as italy holds the largest share of passenger traffic among eu countries having recorded the passing through its ports of nearly 86 million passengers or 20 of the eu total eurostat 2020 fig 1 clearly shows that the ligurian sea shares the largest portion of the total shipping traffic among the italian regions of the pelagos i e including cumulative tonnage teu and passengers this intense maritime traffic requires a considerable attention toward the safety and the comfort of ships not only as design criteria tezdogan et al 2014 but also as a means of assessing the quality of navigation in service conditions folsø 2004 comfort is a key parameter in passenger ship design and operation since the motions and accelerations to which ships are subjected during navigation in rough seas are well known to impact the well being of passengers and to hamper the normal navigational duties of the crew to reduce the negative effect that the seaway has on the life and work on board seakeeping predictions can be adopted at design stage to improve the hull geometry and during the service life of the ship to forecast the short and long term comfort levels recent analyses of the ligurian and north tyrrhenian seas sea wave statistics along the italian coasts have shown an increase of the average wave height over the past years corsini et al 2006 on the one hand this weather deterioration may require an adaptation of ship design strategies on the other the routes more prone to heavy weather will need to be identified and more closely observed to ensure that the target comfort levels are granted throughout the journeys the long term quality of on board comfort in the ligurian and north tyrrhenian seas may be assessed by investigating the effect that probabilistic wave systems have on the responses of the ships this analysis may be carried out according to the following procedure 1 route characterization the main routes for the ship category of interest can be isolated by analysing the spatial distribution and density of the messages transmitted by the automatic identification system ais of the ships the ais data particularly allows to characterise the traffic pathways by analysing the main characteristics of the ships of each route this can only be achieved by the use of real navigational data and leads to identify the most representative ships on each route in terms of dimensions dimensional ratios and probability of encounter 2 seakeeping profiling of the representative ships which can be performed assuming that each ship bears geometrical affinity with a parent hull this is a reasonable approximation for a single type of ships under the inviscid assumptions of most seakeeping theories 3 identification of probabilistic sea states in the area of interest up to date wave scatter diagrams can be employed to define realistic sea state and their relative probability in most cases only unimodal sea state parameters are available from published wave scatter diagrams which can be used as is or to reconstruct complete directional spectra using common statistical distributions 4 probabilistic assessment of ship comfort on the routes of interest the seakeeping properties of the representative ships and the probabilistic sea states are combined to derive the probabilistic ship responses broadly speaking the procedure above described can provide a means for the assessment of the comfort and safety on a number of routes or areas of interest in addition the knowledge of the real weather and the comfort and safety levels that the ship is statistically expected to encounter on a particular route also stands as a key design feature in aiding the selection of improved ship dimensions hull forms and propulsive machinery to match a realistic seaway this paper presents the application of this method to one of the major commercial passenger routes in the north thyrrhenian sea the genoa port torres route which is one of the major passenger routes crossing the pelagos marine mammals sanctuary which spans from the northern coast of sardinia and tuscany to the ligurian sea and the french var fig 2 the main aim of the paper is to describe the method to derive a statistical representation of the seakeeping characteristics of the chosen route in doing so the paper focusses on the comfort of passengers and crew on board a variety of ferries that are observed to sail on the genoa port torres route it may however be considered that the methodology here presented may be employed to study any consequence of the ship behaviour in rough weather such as structural integrity stability manoeuvrability and so forth in achieving the above aim the paper is structured as follows the remaining of the introduction lays out the background knowledge to this work section 2 will detail the five steps of the procedure briefly outlined in the previous paragraph at first the method employed for the analysis of the ais data will be described following the procedure for the identification and characterization of the a route will be shown and applied to the genoa port torres passenger route the seakeeping theory used in this work will then be described and justified followed by a description of the adopted test matrix wave scatter diagrams will be extrapolated and discretised from recent state of the art wave hindcast data to reconstruct the sea states likely to be encountered by any ship along the route of interest the spectral and probabilistic analyses of the ships behaviour on the route will then be detailed together with the derivation of the comfort levels the results of the analysis will be presented and discussed in section 3 finally conclusions and future recommendations will be given in section 4 1 1 background the seakeeping analysis of ships has three main objectives cummins 1972 bsra 1981 namely habitability operability survivability the first is concerned with the well being of passengers and crew on board ships since the evaluation of habitability leads to different results depending on the type of ship and the distribution of passengers and crew on board cruise liners and passenger vessels will be more sensitive to motions and accelerations than for instance a laden tanker the operability is related to the capability of the ship and its systems to being operated effectively and safely in a seaway this includes the minimization of local and global structural loads the requirements for minimum powering in rough weather and the integrity of manoeuvring systems the survivability is finally concerned with the damaged stability of the ship historically a great part of the literature has been devoted to the study of the stability and structural integrity of ships in a seaway regarded as the limiting conditions for a safe operability the recent applied seakeeping research focusses on stability e g umeda and hamamoto 2000 spyrou et al 2002 van daalen et al 2014 umeda et al 2016 wang et al 2018 manoeuvring e g shigunov and papanikolaou 2015 tello ruiz et al 2019 and rare events modelling e g drummen and holtmann 2014 liu et al 2015 kawamura et al 2016 however for a passenger vessel in intact conditions the limitations imposed by habitability criteria are stricter than those derived from an operability assessment bhattacharyya 1978 the effect of ship motions and accelerations on the comfort of passengers has been studied since the introduction in the mid 70s of the concept of motion sickness incidence msi by o hanlon and mccauley 1974 the msi was defined as the percentage of people subjected to emesis over a period of 2 h and it was expressed as 1 m s i 74 100 0 5 erf log x 3 g μ m s i 0 4 where x 3 is the half cycle average vertical acceleration g is the gravitational acceleration and μ m s i was defined as 2 μ m s i 0 819 2 32 log ω e where ω e is the wave frequency of encounter the findings of this well known seminal work have been improved by lawther and griffin 1987 with the introduction of the concept of motion sickness dose value msdv which is defined as 3 m s d v 87 0 t e x 3 2 t d t where t e is the period of encounter the m s d v 87 was applied to the calculation of the m s i 87 as per the following lawther and griffin 1987 4 m s i 87 k m m s d v 87 where the constant k m defines the population characteristics these theories have been standardised in the iso 2631 1 iso 1997 which essentially adds a frequency filter in reason of the different impact that narrowband frequencies have on the human body the msi method has been often applied to investigate the use of seasickness as a performance criterion both at design stage and in service sariöz and sariöz 2005 sariöz and narli 2005 apply the iso 2631 definition of the msi and the motion induced interruptions mii concept graham 1990 to the assessment of the comfort of a 50m motor yacht the authors calculate the vessel responses to several sea state combinations by means of a strip theory program the authors conclude that the vessel performance is heavily dependant on the selected limiting criteria the msi may also be used at design stage as an optimization parameter to improve the in service seakeeping performance of the ship taking the case of a conventional passenger vessel pérez arribas and lópez piñeiro 2007 claim that the ship design should be optimised to minimise a revised definition of the msi this is shown to depend on the location and activity of the passengers on board and leads to the introduction of the posture coefficient i e a weight factor to the calculation of the msdv the effect of seasickness on board ships is analysed by means of simulations and full scale trials comparisons by turan et al 2009 with the introduction of a novel seasickness model based on a variant of the sensory conflict hypothesis the results showed that a more complete model of the human vestibular system yields a better assessment of passenger comfort when compared to the full scale records reported in the paper the msdv has been implemented in a time domain seakeeping simulation by kim and kim 2014 with the aim of demonstrating the benefits of stabilising fins on passenger vessels the msdv is calculated at four different locations and provides an effective means of assessing the improved vessel performance when stabilising fins are used a comprehensive application of msi is given by tezdogan et al 2014 who present a way to assess the operability of a passenger ship based on human comfort criteria wave scattered diagrams are used to characterise the long term statistics of the seaway in the area of interest these are combined with the ship s response amplitude operators raos the paper explores three formulations of the strip theory and the effects of different operability criteria among which are the bare vertical and lateral accelerations the iso 2631 s msi and the mii the authors successfully demonstrate the usefulness of using wave scatter diagrams to assess the probabilistic operability of a passenger vessel based on passenger comfort criteria kucukdemiral et al 2019 use a 2 degree of freedom simplified seakeeping model to study the effect of stabilising fins on a medium speed vessel sailing in long crested irregular waves the model proved sufficient to calibrate the motion controller of two pairs of active stabilising fins at the bow and stern of the vessel the effect of adverse weather on long and short sea shipping has also been investigated in the perspective of risk analysis several studies have been devoted to the statistical correlation between weather conditions and ship accidents in general e g guedes soares et al 2001 guedes soares and teixeira 2001 antão and guedes soares 2008 eliopoulou et al 2016 paterson et al 2018 endrina et al 2018 ventikos et al 2018 the impact of heavy weather on specific routes was instead investigated by de osés and castells 2008 the authors assess the effect of weather on five routes travelled by high speed ships by deriving wave height statistics from relevant wave buoys it is noted that in spite of the successful attempt to correlate weather with passenger ship operability the wave heights are arbitrarily associated with specific seakeeping criteria regardless of the ship direction or size another method to evaluate the response of the marine traffic on a given route to the weather forcing is by statistically analysing the behaviour of all ships sailing on the route fujii et al 2017 use a combination of ais data analysis and crew interviews to evaluate the actual risk of heavy rolling on container ships and car carriers operating along north pacific routes although analysing more than 20 000 datapoints the paper succeeds at assigning a risk level to the routes based on the questionnaires but does not employ a rigorous evaluation of ship motions with respect to the encountered weather the relevant literature above reviewed shows that attempts for an evaluation of the sailing comfort quality on an entire commercial passenger route are yet to be made the present paper aims at filling this knowledge gap by presenting a method capable of providing a probabilistic representation of ship comfort on an entire route of choice within the above framework the key aspects for achieving this may be thus summarised as follows 1 route characterization which can be achieved inferring the characteristics of some ships to the route itself by identifying the route s more representative ships based on statistical criteria all the relevant ship dimensions must be considered this should be done by obtaining actual route data e g by employing ais data 2 seakeeping profiling of the representative ships should be achieved by means of a suitable and reasonably accurate seakeeping theory 3 marine weather hindcast should cover a substantial historical period should be recent and should include directional spreading i e must allow for short crested irregular waves 2 methodology the sailing comfort on a route depends upon the characteristics of the ship which are described by its raos of the seaway which is described by its wave energy density spectrum and on their mutual angle of encounter route course the customary seakeeping analyses imply the combination of a deterministic ship with a deterministic sea state instead the method presented in this paper is based on the assumption that the seakeeping properties of probabilistic derived ships combined with probabilistic sea states provide a suitable statistical representation of the seakeeping responses and hence comfort on a particular route andrew et al 1984 the statistical analysis of the ships sailing on the genoa port torres route is provided in this section under the paragraph route characterization which identifies families of passenger vessels sailing on the route with their associated probability the seakeeping characteristics of each vessel family are assimilated to those of the ship having the highest probability of the family as it will be shown in the paragraph seakeeping profiling the probabilistic sea states are reconstructed as jonswap spectra from the mean parameters provided by the employed wave atlas i e significant wave height mean wave period and mean direction the combinations of mean parameters are discretised and their probability of occurrence calculated in the probabilistic sea state definition paragraph finally the comfort on the route is evaluated in the paragraph probabilistic assessment of route comfort by combining each sea state combination probabilistic spectra with the seakeeping characteristics of the vessel families 2 1 route characterization the first step to the assessment of a passenger route comfort is the definition and characterization of the route itself although this can be somehow accomplished by means of charted routes precise information regarding the types dimensions and probability of the ships sailing on the route can only be gained by analysing real data an automatic identification system ais is conceived to provide information about the vessel to other vessels and to shore based receiving stations in a self organised automatic way with the general aim to improve the maritime situational awareness imo 2010 itu r 2014 owing to the large number of seagoing vessels required to boast ais equipment the extraction of information from ais data is of great aid in several logistic and safety related problems the main applications of ais analysis pertain recognition of marine traffic patterns route planning anomaly detection and collision avoidance tu et al 2018 yang et al 2019 the information conveyed by ais messages include position speed over ground sog course over ground cog heading vessel name vessel type and dimensions 2 1 0 1 ais data management the ais data used in this study are collected by the italian coast guard ccpgc employing the national ais base station network more than 60 stations spread over the national territory ensure complete coverage of the national shores in certain regions stretching the ais catchment area across the italian search and rescue sar zone the ais data are provided by the ccpgc in the form of pre processed and pre filtered tab separated strings each containing selected parsed data of the transmitting ship for better accessibility the data were stored in a relational database server mysql the data are then classified in reason of the ship types defined in table 1 to simplify subsequent analysis and relieve the consequent computational burden despite the preliminary pre processing carried out by the ccpgc outlying values and invalid or incomplete datapoints were still observed to contaminate the dataset these and the messages transmitted by near stationary vessels were further filtered by imposing s o g 3 kn s o g 80 kn c o g 0 deg c o g 360 deg v e s s e l n a m e null the latter constraint is usually sufficient to ensure the discardment of datapoints lacking certain manual input information e g mmsi vessel dimensions imo number etc such datapoints were nevertheless noted to account for up to 0 5 of the total dataset the removal of invalid and near stationary datapoints instead resulted in a reduction of more than 70 of the dataset the majority of the ais data indeed appears to be emitted by ships at anchor at berth or manoeuvring in harbours however the wealth of available data ensures the statistical relevance of the analysis even after the drastic reduction of the dataset 2 1 0 2 route identification a means of identification of the principal routes can be found in traffic density maps chen et al 2015 in this process the density of vectorial ais data are calculated on a discretised spatial grid and stored in a georeferenced raster layer tsou 2010 pallotta et al 2013a b the vessel density may be defined as the number of ais messages received per unit space a sort of ais density this method can be efficiently used to identify the main routes in a relatively small area silveira et al 2013 to identify a route in the region of interest the following procedure was adopted 1 study of the ais density distribution 2 selection of a cut off density threshold to define areas subjected to higher traffic 3 isolation of the area of the route of interest 4 extraction of the ais data covered by the area identified by means of step 3 to accomplish the above the region investigated in this research was at first discretised in a uniform grid the dimensions of the side of each grid cell was chosen in the order of a ship s length the cells were thus assigned size 100mx100m kernel density estimation kde was then used to estimate the continuous distribution of ais data from the discrete vectorial dataset according to this statistic the contribution of each ais datum x i to the density calculated at a point in space x is smoothed depending on the distance between x i and x on the shape of the chosen kernel i e smoothing function and on the size bandwidth given to it formally the real distribution f of a dataset x 1 2 n is thus approximated by silverman 1986 5 f ˆ x 1 n h i 1 n k t where k is the kernel function t x x i h and h is the bandwidth in this research the epanechnikov kernel function was used 6 k 3 4 1 t 2 for t 1 0 otherwise where t x x i h in the present case a bandwidth of 1000m was assigned based on eqs 5 and 6 to give almost equal weight to the ais points laying in the cell and in the cells immediately adjacent to it fig 3 shows the density map obtained with the above settings the density scale shown by the colour is clearly only qualitative since it results from a kernel interpolation and does not represent the real density calculated in each cell the colours are simply assigned based on a linear interpolation between 0 and a value 2500 determined from the maximum density in the separated traffic outside genoa harbour the procedure to choose the density threshold is as follows a tentative density threshold is at first defined based on visual observation of the density distribution map the tentative value was chosen based on the maximum density observed at the merging of the large routes outside of the genoa harbour the principal routes can easily be seen as the areas with greater density from green to dark red which allowed the cut off density threshold to be identified at about a tenth of the maximum 250 note that this value need not be very accurate but shall be such to encompass the majority of the route of interest the suitability of the threshold will be verified by analysing the distribution of the traffic on the route operating on the raster layer it was possible to define a mask layer for regions of the grid having density higher than the threshold fig 4 the original ais data along the routes of interest can be finally extracted using the density mask layer the genoa port torres route highlighted in fig 4 is here discussed in detail 2 1 0 3 route characterization the genoa port torres route is subdivided in two legs leg 1 northern and leg 2 southern a preliminary analysis of the cog distribution of the ais data selected from the previous analysis revealed the presence of ships crossing the genoa port torres route from various angles fig 5 these data were removed to avoid extraneous ships to contaminate further analysis based on the cog distribution the southbound and northbound trips could be identified from the data and analysed separately since the seakeeping performance of ships in heading or following seas varies greatly after this preliminary analysis the total amount of ais messages extracted on the legs is 290 236 whereas the number of different ships is 56 note that the route is considered away from and up to their merging outside of the harbours see fig 4 this decision was taken to diversify the traffic within the vts vessel traffic services and port approach areas from the on route traffic at first the transversal distribution of the ships with respect to the mean centre of the route was investigated fig 6 shows the transversal spread of the ships from the mean centreline of the southbound and northbound traffic lanes the graph shows an approximately normal distribution which decreases naturally tending to zero at the tail ends the suitability of the threshold density parameter earlier chosen is also confirmed by the transversal distribution which might otherwise show longer or cut tails the seakeeping properties of the route can be captured by observing the behaviour of its most representative vessels the key to identifying a representative ship is the choice of a parameter which is both relevant to the seakeeping and readily available from the ais data for ships sailing at the same speed the ship dimensions and more specifically the ship length are of greater importance since the ship responses strictly depend on the wave encountering frequency to ship natural frequency ratio ω e ω the statistical analysis of the ship length on the available ais dataset is approached by assessing the entire dataset of ais data recorded on the given route 290 236 datapoints in other words the l distribution arising from the above pool of ships is weighted by the number of ais messages received for each ship it follows that this approach identifies the most frequent ship length that can be recorded on a given route the ship length discretization is carried out at 50m steps which is sufficient to observe significant seakeeping differences bhattacharyya 1978 fig 7 shows the distribution of l along the genoa port torres route for the entire weighted ais dataset and for the 56 ships of the route taken only once unweighted the weighted histogram distinguishes seven ship families having lengths ranging 40 350 m the highest probability identifies ships between 175 and 225 m long with a relative probability about tenfold than the second highest this result is very different from the unweighted dataset which shows very similar probabilities for several ship families the analysis of weighted data suggests that ordinary passenger vessels are the most frequently found on this route which corresponds to the general profile of the genova porto torres seaway table 2 summarises the characterization of the genoa port torres route by reporting the global transversal spread of the southbound and northbound seaways two standard deviations from the mean the average ship speed on the route and the speed spread again two standard deviations the main directions and the number of waypoints per each leg table 3 presents the representative ships for the genoa port torres route the column p shows the probability of encountering ships of the same length as the representative ship on the given route from table 3 the likeliest representative ship is identified as the m v sharden a 214m passenger ship with length over breadth ratio of l b 8 mean speed v s 19 kn and total probability on the route of p 0 92 which is coherent with the known genoa port torres profile 2 2 ship raos the ship moving at a speed v s encountering a regular seaway with wave amplitude ζ 0 and wave encountering frequency ω e at an angle μ 180deg head waves will be be subjected to motions in her 6 degrees of freedom dof for each i th translatory motion i 1 3 a nondimensional response amplitude operator rao may be defined as 7 r i ω e μ ϰ i 0 ζ 0 similarly for each i th rotatory motion i 4 6 a nondimensional rao may be defined as 8 r i ω e μ ϰ i 0 κ 0 where κ 0 is the wave slope many methods can be used to calculate the raos of ships including experimental techniques cfd and other analytical and numerical methods tezdogan et al 2014 carchen 2019 undemanding numerical calculations are available since the late 50s with the introduction of the strip theory korvin kroukovsky and jacobs 1957 which still nowadays remains one of the primary seakeeping prediction tools in its various revisions faltinsen 2005 the advantages of the strip theory are down to the quickness of calculation and its applicability to a wide variety of hullforms however it is also known to present shortcomings in the calculation of the diffraction effect with consequent inaccuracies at higher froude numbers oblique seas and at the higher encountering frequencies faltinsen et al 1991 söding 2006 bertram 2016 for the present study the accuracy yielded by a modern strip theory formulation is sufficient the 6 dof raos were calculated with the open source code pdstrip the program is based on the conventional strip theory in the revised form proposed by söding 1969 and it has been used and validated in several studies an extensive investigation was conducted by gourlay et al 2015 who showed the comparison of the motions of three different cargo vessels measured from model tests and calculated with several commercially available seakeeping codes among which pdstrip the paper showed overall a good agreement between experiments and computational results particularly for the heave and pitch motions where discrepancies never exceed 20 as in the conventional strip theory the contribution of viscous forces is largely neglected assuming that they are small compared to the magnitude of pressure forces in addition pdstrip is capable of computing the ship responses at any encountering angle which suits the purposes of the present work the main input needed to compute the raos in pdstrip is the hull geometry given as a number of transverse sections defined by approximately equally spaced points söding 2006 because obtaining the hull geometries of all representative ships was neither practical nor feasible it has been assumed that all the representative ships have a hull geometry similar to a parent hull of the same category the parent hull was chosen that of a general passenger ship which operates on a similar route the hulls of the other representative ships were generated by scaling the parent according to their dimensions this assumption holds particularly in virtue of the inviscid hypothesis of the strip theory so that it is expected that small differences between the real hull and the used geometry have negligible effects on the calculation of the responses fig 8 shows the parent geometry obtained at the draught of 6 4m the motion raos were calculated for wave heading angles μ 0 180 deg at intervals of 15deg and at wave encountering frequencies matching wave lengths λ 0 3 l 5 l since the speed on the route is fairly constant each ship is given her mean speed reported in table 3 figs 9 and 10 show respectively the heave and pitch transfer functions calculated at the above conditions for the sharden and plotted against the wave length to ship length ratio λ l head waves are for μ 180 deg figs 11 and 12 show instead the heave and pitch raos against the wavelength λ for all the 7 representative ships in regular head waves μ 180 deg and at their own characteristics speed see table 3 looking at the heave plot of fig 9 it is first noted that the resonance frequency of the ship s response occurs at a wave length ratio of about 0 7 as expected this frequency shifts to lower ratios as the waves move from head to following for beam waves a peak of the heave response amplitude is observed at the resonance frequency the pitch rao in regular head waves shows natural pitch frequencies at λ l 0 5 and λ l 1 2 fig 10 the resonance frequencies again shift to lower ratios as heading angle decreases to 0deg figs 11 and 12 provide an insight of the variation of the raos with ship size although the comparison is affected by the different froude number f n at which the vessels operate this is particularly evident in fig 12 where the peak of the smallest vessel f n 0 24 occurs at higher wave lengths than the second smallest f n 0 17 overall the results are in line with the responses of similar vessels spentza 2016 although no validation study will be presented in this work the raos which are calculated by pdstrip at midships on the keel line are transposed to a motion point of interest for the passenger vessels under examination the point is chosen such to be representative of the average passenger location during a day trip the point is detailed for the m v sharden in fig 13 and table 4 its position is scaled on other vessels 2 3 probabilistic analysis of the sea state to obtain a probabilistic distribution of the sea state conditions over the area of interest the extensive hindcast wave atlas implemented at the department of civil chemical and environmental engineering dicca of the university of genoa was used mentaschi et al 2015 the databased was reconstructed employing forcing the wavewatch iii model with wrf model reanalysis data and it was validated in the north thyrrhenian sea using the entire set of records from the italian national wave measurement network ron the red exterior redext buoys and a set of buoys from the greek poseidon network mentaschi et al 2013b a 2015 the dicca dataset is comprehensive of hourly unimodal marine hindcast for the whole mediterranean sea on a 10 km grid from the 1st january 1979 to the 31st december 2019 the available data include among the others 1 timestamp 2 significant wave height h s 3 mean wave period t 1 4 average wave direction θ m 5 average wave directional spreading θ s to reduce the dimensions of the hindcast analysis problem the data were discretised in 45deg steps 8 angular sectors with wave heights and periods every 1m and 1s respectively the discretization was carried out for all the route s waypoints and the probability of occurrence of each sea state combination was calculated and stored fig 14 shows the polar distribution of the wave height half way through the route at point id 933 of the wavewatch iii grid fig 15 shows the discretization of the hindcast sea states for the 8 angular sectors the full directional wave spectra are known to yield more accurate ship response results against the unimodal parametric reconstructions due to their superior representation of the natural seaway spentza et al 2017 portilla yandún et al 2019 for this reason a full wave energy density spectrum was reconstructed from each combination of wave height mean period and mean direction and for all of the waypoints yielding a total of 7 605 spectra for limited fetch areas the jonswap spectrum is the most suitable statistical representation of the seaway energy hasselmann et al 1973 corsini et al 2006 the jonswap spectrum is defined as 9 s ζ ω s p m ω γ θ ω where ω is the angular frequency of the wave components γ is the spectral peak enhancement factor s p m ω is the pierson moskovitz spectrum and θ ω is a filtering function having the maximum in correspondence of the spectral peak frequency the latter is defined as 10 θ ω exp 1 2 ω ω p σ ω p 2 where ω p is the peak spectral frequency and σ is the peak width parameter which defines the cut off frequency bands and is defined as 11 σ σ a if ω ω p σ b if ω ω p in the present work the values of γ σ a and σ b were assigned based on statistics of the italian wave atlas for the la spezia ron wave buoy corsini et al 2006 yielding 12a γ 2 02 12b σ a 0 10 12c σ b 0 07 a conventional cosine function was chosen to represent the directional wave spreading defined in function of the wave component direction θ as ittc 2017 13 d θ a cos 2 s θ θ m 2 θ θ m π π where θ m is the mean wave direction s the spreading parameter and a is a spreading amplitude function defined as 14 a 2 2 s 1 γ 2 s 1 π γ 2 s 1 the spreading parameter s was chosen such to minimise the difference between the average wave directional spreading θ s derived from the hindcast and that calculated from the cosine spreading ittc 2017 15 σ θ 2 1 c 1 0 5 where 16 c 1 2 0 2 π d θ sin θ d θ 2 0 2 π d θ cos θ d θ 2 this yielded a spreading parameter s 3 the reconstructed full directional wave energy density spectrum is defined as customary as 17 s ζ ω θ s ζ ω d θ fig 16 shows an example of reconstructed full directional wave spectrum obtained from a sea state with mean direction 290deg h s 2 m and t 1 4 s 2 4 probabilistic analysis of ship responses each vessel family represented by the ships identified in table 3 was then combined with the probabilistic wave spectra for the two directions of travel of the genoa port torres route hereby named northbound and southbound directions the total number of assessed combinations is therefore 7 605 7 2 106 470 the spectral analyses were conducted following the customary theory and notation the ordinate of the i th motion energy density spectrum is calculated as a function of the wave frequency ω and wave angle of encounter μ as follows 18 s ϰ i 0 ω μ s ζ ω μ r i 2 ω μ where s ζ ω μ and r i ω μ represent respectively the wave energy density spectrum and the i th rao as a function of wave frequency and wave angle of encounter the zero th spectral moment or variance of s ϰ i 0 is defined as 19 m i 0 0 0 2 π s ϰ i 0 d μ d ω the significant double amplitude of motion is then defined as 20 m 2 m i 0 similarly the 4th spectral moment or variance of the acceleration and its significant double amplitude are 21 m i 4 0 0 2 π ω 4 s ϰ i 0 d μ d ω 22 a 2 m i 4 the on board comfort is evaluated in this paper by employing the iso 2631 1 msi level definition which was calculated from the vertical accelerations at the defined deck location according to the following equation iso 1997 23 m s i k m m s d v where similarly to eq 3 the msdv is defined as iso 1997 24 m s d v 0 t x 3 2 t d t where t is the duration of the motion exposure in accordance with the literature a fixed exposure time of 2 h tezdogan et al 2014 and k m 1 3 which defines a mixed population of unadapted males and females were adopted iso 1997 it should be remembered that due to the consistent assumptions of its derivation the msi does not give a necessarily accurate estimation of the percentage of the on board population that will be subjected to emesis it will however serve as a good relative indicator of the ride comfort lloyd 1989 for this reason no thresholds were associated to the msi values although msi levels ranging 20 35 may generally be held as critical o hanlon and mccauley 1974 3 results and discussion to limit the amount of plots presented in this section where deemed necessary the results have been presented for a selected number of waypoints these are represented in fig 17 alongside all the other waypoints used in the analyses see fig 18 as expected the results show an evident correlation between the sea conditions the ship size and the msi the average msi over the genoa port torres route is reported for every ship as a function of the significant wave height h s and the mean wave period t m in fig 19 the figure shows a nearly linear relationship between the msi and the wave height and a second order relationship with the mean period the increasing size of the vessel reduces the slope and hence the overall values of the h s m s i function and shifts the peak of the t m m s i function towards higher t m values these are consequences respectively of the increasing inertial forces with respect to the froude krylov forces and of the natural frequency of the ship moving to lower frequencies the scatter noticed in the calculated datapoints is due to the different angles of encounter of the seaway the significant wave height can be converted to a degree of the world meteorological organization sea state code i e douglas scale since the msi also depends on wave period and direction the relationship with the sea state is not univocal the msi values can be averaged for each douglas scale degree to provide a sea state msi relationship fig 20 shows average values of msi plotted against the sea state that produced them for all representative ships the observations made for fig 19 are here more apparent and highlight the impact of ship size on the msi scale from a spatial viewpoint the weather intensity and hence the ship comfort vary considerably along the genoa port torres route owing to the topography and bathymetry of the area figs 20 and 21 show respectively the average and maximum msi values at each waypoint for all representative ships besides the ship size effect it is observed that the msi values are smaller towards the ports and reach a peak roughly half way through the route in particular it can be noticed that the average msi of fig 20 increases almost linearly up to waypoint wp 13 and almost stabilises until wp 31 before dropping nearer to the sardinian shore this observation indicates a sheltering nature of the ligurian sea against the predominant south western wave systems corsini et al 2006 a closer insight into the effect of the wave system directions and their probability is provided by the polar diagrams in fig 22 obtained at waypoint wp 14 the polar plots show the percentage probability of each representative ship to produce certain msi values depending on the mean wave direction and the ship course hereby referred to as northbound and southbound these polar plots are coherent with the wave height polar distribution of fig 14 which confirms the predominance of south western seas because of the strong effects that the global heave and pitch motions have on the local heave acceleration the highest msi values are observed for northerly and southerly seas which fall either in the bow or stern sectors it is also noted that the plots present little differences between northbound and southbound courses and higher msi values are not always encountered for bow seas this is likely due to the average wave encountering frequencies approaching the natural frequencies ω e ω 1 in the different combinations of ship sizes and directions the effect of location and course direction on the ship comfort can be observed from the probability distributions of fig 23 at each of the observation waypoints see fig 17 the msi histograms of the representative ship with highest probability on the genoa port torres route m v sharden are here plotted for the two courses northbound and southbound the msi distribution is observed to follow an approximate rayleigh probability density function which is a consequence of its strong correlation with the wave height distribution the differences in msi probability between the two courses are generally negligible 0 05 with the exception of wp 8 and wp 14 where the southbound course shows stronger probabilities of reaching higher msi values this is in agreement with the observations made for fig 22 in addition the higher msi values observed for the middle of the route in fig 20 can be observed from the increased probability associated to the higher msi values around wp 14 wp 20 and wp 26 overall it can be observed that the m v sharden is mostly subjected to msi values in the order of 5 on average a global perspective on all the vessel sizes can instead be gained from fig 24 where the msi probability distribution for all representative vessels is plotted the histogram clearly shows the upward shift of the mean msi values with the increasing vessel size in general the msi values are in the range 0 10 with relatively smaller ships 150m extending the range to 15 rare events can be seen to provoke msi of 20 and greater a more detailed overview is given in tables 5 and 6 which report respectively the average and maximum msi values for all the representative ships and all the wave origin sectors on average the msi values for the smaller vessels 150m is settled around 12 whereas it is about half for the larger ships while this is a relatively high value it must be placed in the context of the characteristics of the maritime traffic on the genoa port torres route fig 7 and table 3 showed that the smallest ships are related to almost negligible probabilities on the route making relatively rare the occurrence of the high msi values of small vessels in tables 5 and 6 from a weather direction point of view the most uncomfortable journeys seem instead to occur with south westerly and westerly seas while south easterly weather has a milder effect on the route globally the average msi is about 8 which is generally acceptable although it is not uncommon to witness ferry trip cancellations with like msi values the global maximum msi level was calculated at about 35 which is close to the maximum achievable with accelerations in the orderof 1 m s 2 4 conclusions this paper successfully presented a probabilistic method to evaluate the passenger comfort quality in terms of the motion sickness incidence msi index when sailing on a commercial route to the best knowledge of the authors this paper represents the first probabilistic assessment of the kind which makes use of real navigational data ais for the characterization of the route and of accurate wave atlases for the probabilistic assessment of the marine weather a large commercial passenger route genoa port torres was identified employing a kde analysis of a six months dataset of ais data and characterized by identifying its most representative ships with defined ship size families the seakeeping characteristics of all representative ships were calculated by means of a strip theory code for a range of regular wave frequencies and bearing angles state of the art wave atlases comprehensive of 40 years of hourly hindcast data were employed to obtain a probabilistic representation of the seaway in the proximity of the route full directional spectra were then reconstructed for discretised combinations of wave height wave period and direction the ship responses along the route were calculated at each location for all representative ships and all marine weather combinations finally the sailing comfort was then evaluated by calculating the msi according to the iso 2361 formulation iso 1997 the following conclusions can be drawn the analysis of ais data essential for the investigation of the actual maritime traffic and allows to characterise the ships sailing on each route from real navigational data up to date comprehensive wave hindcast data allows a detailed assessment of the wave statistics which can be profitably used to calculate realistic ship responses for a range of applications the analysis of the vessel responses in relation with the sea intensity allows to associate different comfort levels to a sea state degree depending on the ship and location the msi analysis also allows to identify the most critical locations and ship sizes for the ride comfort of the selected route in relation with its statistical wave properties overall the analysis show that the genoa port torres route is generally a reasonably comfortable route particularly for the larger vessels 150m which appear to be the most frequently observed on the route future work will be oriented on the following subjects implementation of more accurate seakeeping theories selection of suitable msi thresholds to provide warning indications and clear design criteria assessment of a larger number of routes and ship types for a more comprehensive classification of

20944,the intense maritime traffic of modern days requires that a considerable attention be paid toward the comfort of ships not only as design criteria but also as a means of assessing the quality of navigation in service conditions certain passenger routes and ship dimensions are more vulnerable than others to rough weather and the current climate changes require adaptation of design and navigation warning strategies the main aim of the paper is to describe a method to derive a probabilistic representation of the comfort of passengers and crew on a selected route ais data is used to identify and characterise the chosen route the seakeeping properties of the principal ships are evaluated employing a strip theory code detailed wave hindcast data is then employed to build state of the art wave scatter diagrams along the route which allow the calculation of the ship responses for each sea state and the associated probability the motion sickness incidence is finally used as a comparative measure of the overall on board comfort experienced on a variety of passenger vessels keywords msi route comfort probability ais seakeeping wave scatter diagrams 1 introduction the relentless expansion of the maritime trade has led the worldwide shipping traffic volume to quadruplicate over a period of 50 years reaching an estimated 11 billion tons in 2018 unctad 2018 in 2019 the ligurian and north tyrrhenian seas in the mediterranean sea absorbed together about 0 2 of the almost 0 5 billion cargo tons handled by the italian ports srm assoporti 2019 which is estimated to be about 14 of the eu total freight traffic eurostat 2020 the statistics are even higher for ferry and cruise shipping as italy holds the largest share of passenger traffic among eu countries having recorded the passing through its ports of nearly 86 million passengers or 20 of the eu total eurostat 2020 fig 1 clearly shows that the ligurian sea shares the largest portion of the total shipping traffic among the italian regions of the pelagos i e including cumulative tonnage teu and passengers this intense maritime traffic requires a considerable attention toward the safety and the comfort of ships not only as design criteria tezdogan et al 2014 but also as a means of assessing the quality of navigation in service conditions folsø 2004 comfort is a key parameter in passenger ship design and operation since the motions and accelerations to which ships are subjected during navigation in rough seas are well known to impact the well being of passengers and to hamper the normal navigational duties of the crew to reduce the negative effect that the seaway has on the life and work on board seakeeping predictions can be adopted at design stage to improve the hull geometry and during the service life of the ship to forecast the short and long term comfort levels recent analyses of the ligurian and north tyrrhenian seas sea wave statistics along the italian coasts have shown an increase of the average wave height over the past years corsini et al 2006 on the one hand this weather deterioration may require an adaptation of ship design strategies on the other the routes more prone to heavy weather will need to be identified and more closely observed to ensure that the target comfort levels are granted throughout the journeys the long term quality of on board comfort in the ligurian and north tyrrhenian seas may be assessed by investigating the effect that probabilistic wave systems have on the responses of the ships this analysis may be carried out according to the following procedure 1 route characterization the main routes for the ship category of interest can be isolated by analysing the spatial distribution and density of the messages transmitted by the automatic identification system ais of the ships the ais data particularly allows to characterise the traffic pathways by analysing the main characteristics of the ships of each route this can only be achieved by the use of real navigational data and leads to identify the most representative ships on each route in terms of dimensions dimensional ratios and probability of encounter 2 seakeeping profiling of the representative ships which can be performed assuming that each ship bears geometrical affinity with a parent hull this is a reasonable approximation for a single type of ships under the inviscid assumptions of most seakeeping theories 3 identification of probabilistic sea states in the area of interest up to date wave scatter diagrams can be employed to define realistic sea state and their relative probability in most cases only unimodal sea state parameters are available from published wave scatter diagrams which can be used as is or to reconstruct complete directional spectra using common statistical distributions 4 probabilistic assessment of ship comfort on the routes of interest the seakeeping properties of the representative ships and the probabilistic sea states are combined to derive the probabilistic ship responses broadly speaking the procedure above described can provide a means for the assessment of the comfort and safety on a number of routes or areas of interest in addition the knowledge of the real weather and the comfort and safety levels that the ship is statistically expected to encounter on a particular route also stands as a key design feature in aiding the selection of improved ship dimensions hull forms and propulsive machinery to match a realistic seaway this paper presents the application of this method to one of the major commercial passenger routes in the north thyrrhenian sea the genoa port torres route which is one of the major passenger routes crossing the pelagos marine mammals sanctuary which spans from the northern coast of sardinia and tuscany to the ligurian sea and the french var fig 2 the main aim of the paper is to describe the method to derive a statistical representation of the seakeeping characteristics of the chosen route in doing so the paper focusses on the comfort of passengers and crew on board a variety of ferries that are observed to sail on the genoa port torres route it may however be considered that the methodology here presented may be employed to study any consequence of the ship behaviour in rough weather such as structural integrity stability manoeuvrability and so forth in achieving the above aim the paper is structured as follows the remaining of the introduction lays out the background knowledge to this work section 2 will detail the five steps of the procedure briefly outlined in the previous paragraph at first the method employed for the analysis of the ais data will be described following the procedure for the identification and characterization of the a route will be shown and applied to the genoa port torres passenger route the seakeeping theory used in this work will then be described and justified followed by a description of the adopted test matrix wave scatter diagrams will be extrapolated and discretised from recent state of the art wave hindcast data to reconstruct the sea states likely to be encountered by any ship along the route of interest the spectral and probabilistic analyses of the ships behaviour on the route will then be detailed together with the derivation of the comfort levels the results of the analysis will be presented and discussed in section 3 finally conclusions and future recommendations will be given in section 4 1 1 background the seakeeping analysis of ships has three main objectives cummins 1972 bsra 1981 namely habitability operability survivability the first is concerned with the well being of passengers and crew on board ships since the evaluation of habitability leads to different results depending on the type of ship and the distribution of passengers and crew on board cruise liners and passenger vessels will be more sensitive to motions and accelerations than for instance a laden tanker the operability is related to the capability of the ship and its systems to being operated effectively and safely in a seaway this includes the minimization of local and global structural loads the requirements for minimum powering in rough weather and the integrity of manoeuvring systems the survivability is finally concerned with the damaged stability of the ship historically a great part of the literature has been devoted to the study of the stability and structural integrity of ships in a seaway regarded as the limiting conditions for a safe operability the recent applied seakeeping research focusses on stability e g umeda and hamamoto 2000 spyrou et al 2002 van daalen et al 2014 umeda et al 2016 wang et al 2018 manoeuvring e g shigunov and papanikolaou 2015 tello ruiz et al 2019 and rare events modelling e g drummen and holtmann 2014 liu et al 2015 kawamura et al 2016 however for a passenger vessel in intact conditions the limitations imposed by habitability criteria are stricter than those derived from an operability assessment bhattacharyya 1978 the effect of ship motions and accelerations on the comfort of passengers has been studied since the introduction in the mid 70s of the concept of motion sickness incidence msi by o hanlon and mccauley 1974 the msi was defined as the percentage of people subjected to emesis over a period of 2 h and it was expressed as 1 m s i 74 100 0 5 erf log x 3 g μ m s i 0 4 where x 3 is the half cycle average vertical acceleration g is the gravitational acceleration and μ m s i was defined as 2 μ m s i 0 819 2 32 log ω e where ω e is the wave frequency of encounter the findings of this well known seminal work have been improved by lawther and griffin 1987 with the introduction of the concept of motion sickness dose value msdv which is defined as 3 m s d v 87 0 t e x 3 2 t d t where t e is the period of encounter the m s d v 87 was applied to the calculation of the m s i 87 as per the following lawther and griffin 1987 4 m s i 87 k m m s d v 87 where the constant k m defines the population characteristics these theories have been standardised in the iso 2631 1 iso 1997 which essentially adds a frequency filter in reason of the different impact that narrowband frequencies have on the human body the msi method has been often applied to investigate the use of seasickness as a performance criterion both at design stage and in service sariöz and sariöz 2005 sariöz and narli 2005 apply the iso 2631 definition of the msi and the motion induced interruptions mii concept graham 1990 to the assessment of the comfort of a 50m motor yacht the authors calculate the vessel responses to several sea state combinations by means of a strip theory program the authors conclude that the vessel performance is heavily dependant on the selected limiting criteria the msi may also be used at design stage as an optimization parameter to improve the in service seakeeping performance of the ship taking the case of a conventional passenger vessel pérez arribas and lópez piñeiro 2007 claim that the ship design should be optimised to minimise a revised definition of the msi this is shown to depend on the location and activity of the passengers on board and leads to the introduction of the posture coefficient i e a weight factor to the calculation of the msdv the effect of seasickness on board ships is analysed by means of simulations and full scale trials comparisons by turan et al 2009 with the introduction of a novel seasickness model based on a variant of the sensory conflict hypothesis the results showed that a more complete model of the human vestibular system yields a better assessment of passenger comfort when compared to the full scale records reported in the paper the msdv has been implemented in a time domain seakeeping simulation by kim and kim 2014 with the aim of demonstrating the benefits of stabilising fins on passenger vessels the msdv is calculated at four different locations and provides an effective means of assessing the improved vessel performance when stabilising fins are used a comprehensive application of msi is given by tezdogan et al 2014 who present a way to assess the operability of a passenger ship based on human comfort criteria wave scattered diagrams are used to characterise the long term statistics of the seaway in the area of interest these are combined with the ship s response amplitude operators raos the paper explores three formulations of the strip theory and the effects of different operability criteria among which are the bare vertical and lateral accelerations the iso 2631 s msi and the mii the authors successfully demonstrate the usefulness of using wave scatter diagrams to assess the probabilistic operability of a passenger vessel based on passenger comfort criteria kucukdemiral et al 2019 use a 2 degree of freedom simplified seakeeping model to study the effect of stabilising fins on a medium speed vessel sailing in long crested irregular waves the model proved sufficient to calibrate the motion controller of two pairs of active stabilising fins at the bow and stern of the vessel the effect of adverse weather on long and short sea shipping has also been investigated in the perspective of risk analysis several studies have been devoted to the statistical correlation between weather conditions and ship accidents in general e g guedes soares et al 2001 guedes soares and teixeira 2001 antão and guedes soares 2008 eliopoulou et al 2016 paterson et al 2018 endrina et al 2018 ventikos et al 2018 the impact of heavy weather on specific routes was instead investigated by de osés and castells 2008 the authors assess the effect of weather on five routes travelled by high speed ships by deriving wave height statistics from relevant wave buoys it is noted that in spite of the successful attempt to correlate weather with passenger ship operability the wave heights are arbitrarily associated with specific seakeeping criteria regardless of the ship direction or size another method to evaluate the response of the marine traffic on a given route to the weather forcing is by statistically analysing the behaviour of all ships sailing on the route fujii et al 2017 use a combination of ais data analysis and crew interviews to evaluate the actual risk of heavy rolling on container ships and car carriers operating along north pacific routes although analysing more than 20 000 datapoints the paper succeeds at assigning a risk level to the routes based on the questionnaires but does not employ a rigorous evaluation of ship motions with respect to the encountered weather the relevant literature above reviewed shows that attempts for an evaluation of the sailing comfort quality on an entire commercial passenger route are yet to be made the present paper aims at filling this knowledge gap by presenting a method capable of providing a probabilistic representation of ship comfort on an entire route of choice within the above framework the key aspects for achieving this may be thus summarised as follows 1 route characterization which can be achieved inferring the characteristics of some ships to the route itself by identifying the route s more representative ships based on statistical criteria all the relevant ship dimensions must be considered this should be done by obtaining actual route data e g by employing ais data 2 seakeeping profiling of the representative ships should be achieved by means of a suitable and reasonably accurate seakeeping theory 3 marine weather hindcast should cover a substantial historical period should be recent and should include directional spreading i e must allow for short crested irregular waves 2 methodology the sailing comfort on a route depends upon the characteristics of the ship which are described by its raos of the seaway which is described by its wave energy density spectrum and on their mutual angle of encounter route course the customary seakeeping analyses imply the combination of a deterministic ship with a deterministic sea state instead the method presented in this paper is based on the assumption that the seakeeping properties of probabilistic derived ships combined with probabilistic sea states provide a suitable statistical representation of the seakeeping responses and hence comfort on a particular route andrew et al 1984 the statistical analysis of the ships sailing on the genoa port torres route is provided in this section under the paragraph route characterization which identifies families of passenger vessels sailing on the route with their associated probability the seakeeping characteristics of each vessel family are assimilated to those of the ship having the highest probability of the family as it will be shown in the paragraph seakeeping profiling the probabilistic sea states are reconstructed as jonswap spectra from the mean parameters provided by the employed wave atlas i e significant wave height mean wave period and mean direction the combinations of mean parameters are discretised and their probability of occurrence calculated in the probabilistic sea state definition paragraph finally the comfort on the route is evaluated in the paragraph probabilistic assessment of route comfort by combining each sea state combination probabilistic spectra with the seakeeping characteristics of the vessel families 2 1 route characterization the first step to the assessment of a passenger route comfort is the definition and characterization of the route itself although this can be somehow accomplished by means of charted routes precise information regarding the types dimensions and probability of the ships sailing on the route can only be gained by analysing real data an automatic identification system ais is conceived to provide information about the vessel to other vessels and to shore based receiving stations in a self organised automatic way with the general aim to improve the maritime situational awareness imo 2010 itu r 2014 owing to the large number of seagoing vessels required to boast ais equipment the extraction of information from ais data is of great aid in several logistic and safety related problems the main applications of ais analysis pertain recognition of marine traffic patterns route planning anomaly detection and collision avoidance tu et al 2018 yang et al 2019 the information conveyed by ais messages include position speed over ground sog course over ground cog heading vessel name vessel type and dimensions 2 1 0 1 ais data management the ais data used in this study are collected by the italian coast guard ccpgc employing the national ais base station network more than 60 stations spread over the national territory ensure complete coverage of the national shores in certain regions stretching the ais catchment area across the italian search and rescue sar zone the ais data are provided by the ccpgc in the form of pre processed and pre filtered tab separated strings each containing selected parsed data of the transmitting ship for better accessibility the data were stored in a relational database server mysql the data are then classified in reason of the ship types defined in table 1 to simplify subsequent analysis and relieve the consequent computational burden despite the preliminary pre processing carried out by the ccpgc outlying values and invalid or incomplete datapoints were still observed to contaminate the dataset these and the messages transmitted by near stationary vessels were further filtered by imposing s o g 3 kn s o g 80 kn c o g 0 deg c o g 360 deg v e s s e l n a m e null the latter constraint is usually sufficient to ensure the discardment of datapoints lacking certain manual input information e g mmsi vessel dimensions imo number etc such datapoints were nevertheless noted to account for up to 0 5 of the total dataset the removal of invalid and near stationary datapoints instead resulted in a reduction of more than 70 of the dataset the majority of the ais data indeed appears to be emitted by ships at anchor at berth or manoeuvring in harbours however the wealth of available data ensures the statistical relevance of the analysis even after the drastic reduction of the dataset 2 1 0 2 route identification a means of identification of the principal routes can be found in traffic density maps chen et al 2015 in this process the density of vectorial ais data are calculated on a discretised spatial grid and stored in a georeferenced raster layer tsou 2010 pallotta et al 2013a b the vessel density may be defined as the number of ais messages received per unit space a sort of ais density this method can be efficiently used to identify the main routes in a relatively small area silveira et al 2013 to identify a route in the region of interest the following procedure was adopted 1 study of the ais density distribution 2 selection of a cut off density threshold to define areas subjected to higher traffic 3 isolation of the area of the route of interest 4 extraction of the ais data covered by the area identified by means of step 3 to accomplish the above the region investigated in this research was at first discretised in a uniform grid the dimensions of the side of each grid cell was chosen in the order of a ship s length the cells were thus assigned size 100mx100m kernel density estimation kde was then used to estimate the continuous distribution of ais data from the discrete vectorial dataset according to this statistic the contribution of each ais datum x i to the density calculated at a point in space x is smoothed depending on the distance between x i and x on the shape of the chosen kernel i e smoothing function and on the size bandwidth given to it formally the real distribution f of a dataset x 1 2 n is thus approximated by silverman 1986 5 f ˆ x 1 n h i 1 n k t where k is the kernel function t x x i h and h is the bandwidth in this research the epanechnikov kernel function was used 6 k 3 4 1 t 2 for t 1 0 otherwise where t x x i h in the present case a bandwidth of 1000m was assigned based on eqs 5 and 6 to give almost equal weight to the ais points laying in the cell and in the cells immediately adjacent to it fig 3 shows the density map obtained with the above settings the density scale shown by the colour is clearly only qualitative since it results from a kernel interpolation and does not represent the real density calculated in each cell the colours are simply assigned based on a linear interpolation between 0 and a value 2500 determined from the maximum density in the separated traffic outside genoa harbour the procedure to choose the density threshold is as follows a tentative density threshold is at first defined based on visual observation of the density distribution map the tentative value was chosen based on the maximum density observed at the merging of the large routes outside of the genoa harbour the principal routes can easily be seen as the areas with greater density from green to dark red which allowed the cut off density threshold to be identified at about a tenth of the maximum 250 note that this value need not be very accurate but shall be such to encompass the majority of the route of interest the suitability of the threshold will be verified by analysing the distribution of the traffic on the route operating on the raster layer it was possible to define a mask layer for regions of the grid having density higher than the threshold fig 4 the original ais data along the routes of interest can be finally extracted using the density mask layer the genoa port torres route highlighted in fig 4 is here discussed in detail 2 1 0 3 route characterization the genoa port torres route is subdivided in two legs leg 1 northern and leg 2 southern a preliminary analysis of the cog distribution of the ais data selected from the previous analysis revealed the presence of ships crossing the genoa port torres route from various angles fig 5 these data were removed to avoid extraneous ships to contaminate further analysis based on the cog distribution the southbound and northbound trips could be identified from the data and analysed separately since the seakeeping performance of ships in heading or following seas varies greatly after this preliminary analysis the total amount of ais messages extracted on the legs is 290 236 whereas the number of different ships is 56 note that the route is considered away from and up to their merging outside of the harbours see fig 4 this decision was taken to diversify the traffic within the vts vessel traffic services and port approach areas from the on route traffic at first the transversal distribution of the ships with respect to the mean centre of the route was investigated fig 6 shows the transversal spread of the ships from the mean centreline of the southbound and northbound traffic lanes the graph shows an approximately normal distribution which decreases naturally tending to zero at the tail ends the suitability of the threshold density parameter earlier chosen is also confirmed by the transversal distribution which might otherwise show longer or cut tails the seakeeping properties of the route can be captured by observing the behaviour of its most representative vessels the key to identifying a representative ship is the choice of a parameter which is both relevant to the seakeeping and readily available from the ais data for ships sailing at the same speed the ship dimensions and more specifically the ship length are of greater importance since the ship responses strictly depend on the wave encountering frequency to ship natural frequency ratio ω e ω the statistical analysis of the ship length on the available ais dataset is approached by assessing the entire dataset of ais data recorded on the given route 290 236 datapoints in other words the l distribution arising from the above pool of ships is weighted by the number of ais messages received for each ship it follows that this approach identifies the most frequent ship length that can be recorded on a given route the ship length discretization is carried out at 50m steps which is sufficient to observe significant seakeeping differences bhattacharyya 1978 fig 7 shows the distribution of l along the genoa port torres route for the entire weighted ais dataset and for the 56 ships of the route taken only once unweighted the weighted histogram distinguishes seven ship families having lengths ranging 40 350 m the highest probability identifies ships between 175 and 225 m long with a relative probability about tenfold than the second highest this result is very different from the unweighted dataset which shows very similar probabilities for several ship families the analysis of weighted data suggests that ordinary passenger vessels are the most frequently found on this route which corresponds to the general profile of the genova porto torres seaway table 2 summarises the characterization of the genoa port torres route by reporting the global transversal spread of the southbound and northbound seaways two standard deviations from the mean the average ship speed on the route and the speed spread again two standard deviations the main directions and the number of waypoints per each leg table 3 presents the representative ships for the genoa port torres route the column p shows the probability of encountering ships of the same length as the representative ship on the given route from table 3 the likeliest representative ship is identified as the m v sharden a 214m passenger ship with length over breadth ratio of l b 8 mean speed v s 19 kn and total probability on the route of p 0 92 which is coherent with the known genoa port torres profile 2 2 ship raos the ship moving at a speed v s encountering a regular seaway with wave amplitude ζ 0 and wave encountering frequency ω e at an angle μ 180deg head waves will be be subjected to motions in her 6 degrees of freedom dof for each i th translatory motion i 1 3 a nondimensional response amplitude operator rao may be defined as 7 r i ω e μ ϰ i 0 ζ 0 similarly for each i th rotatory motion i 4 6 a nondimensional rao may be defined as 8 r i ω e μ ϰ i 0 κ 0 where κ 0 is the wave slope many methods can be used to calculate the raos of ships including experimental techniques cfd and other analytical and numerical methods tezdogan et al 2014 carchen 2019 undemanding numerical calculations are available since the late 50s with the introduction of the strip theory korvin kroukovsky and jacobs 1957 which still nowadays remains one of the primary seakeeping prediction tools in its various revisions faltinsen 2005 the advantages of the strip theory are down to the quickness of calculation and its applicability to a wide variety of hullforms however it is also known to present shortcomings in the calculation of the diffraction effect with consequent inaccuracies at higher froude numbers oblique seas and at the higher encountering frequencies faltinsen et al 1991 söding 2006 bertram 2016 for the present study the accuracy yielded by a modern strip theory formulation is sufficient the 6 dof raos were calculated with the open source code pdstrip the program is based on the conventional strip theory in the revised form proposed by söding 1969 and it has been used and validated in several studies an extensive investigation was conducted by gourlay et al 2015 who showed the comparison of the motions of three different cargo vessels measured from model tests and calculated with several commercially available seakeeping codes among which pdstrip the paper showed overall a good agreement between experiments and computational results particularly for the heave and pitch motions where discrepancies never exceed 20 as in the conventional strip theory the contribution of viscous forces is largely neglected assuming that they are small compared to the magnitude of pressure forces in addition pdstrip is capable of computing the ship responses at any encountering angle which suits the purposes of the present work the main input needed to compute the raos in pdstrip is the hull geometry given as a number of transverse sections defined by approximately equally spaced points söding 2006 because obtaining the hull geometries of all representative ships was neither practical nor feasible it has been assumed that all the representative ships have a hull geometry similar to a parent hull of the same category the parent hull was chosen that of a general passenger ship which operates on a similar route the hulls of the other representative ships were generated by scaling the parent according to their dimensions this assumption holds particularly in virtue of the inviscid hypothesis of the strip theory so that it is expected that small differences between the real hull and the used geometry have negligible effects on the calculation of the responses fig 8 shows the parent geometry obtained at the draught of 6 4m the motion raos were calculated for wave heading angles μ 0 180 deg at intervals of 15deg and at wave encountering frequencies matching wave lengths λ 0 3 l 5 l since the speed on the route is fairly constant each ship is given her mean speed reported in table 3 figs 9 and 10 show respectively the heave and pitch transfer functions calculated at the above conditions for the sharden and plotted against the wave length to ship length ratio λ l head waves are for μ 180 deg figs 11 and 12 show instead the heave and pitch raos against the wavelength λ for all the 7 representative ships in regular head waves μ 180 deg and at their own characteristics speed see table 3 looking at the heave plot of fig 9 it is first noted that the resonance frequency of the ship s response occurs at a wave length ratio of about 0 7 as expected this frequency shifts to lower ratios as the waves move from head to following for beam waves a peak of the heave response amplitude is observed at the resonance frequency the pitch rao in regular head waves shows natural pitch frequencies at λ l 0 5 and λ l 1 2 fig 10 the resonance frequencies again shift to lower ratios as heading angle decreases to 0deg figs 11 and 12 provide an insight of the variation of the raos with ship size although the comparison is affected by the different froude number f n at which the vessels operate this is particularly evident in fig 12 where the peak of the smallest vessel f n 0 24 occurs at higher wave lengths than the second smallest f n 0 17 overall the results are in line with the responses of similar vessels spentza 2016 although no validation study will be presented in this work the raos which are calculated by pdstrip at midships on the keel line are transposed to a motion point of interest for the passenger vessels under examination the point is chosen such to be representative of the average passenger location during a day trip the point is detailed for the m v sharden in fig 13 and table 4 its position is scaled on other vessels 2 3 probabilistic analysis of the sea state to obtain a probabilistic distribution of the sea state conditions over the area of interest the extensive hindcast wave atlas implemented at the department of civil chemical and environmental engineering dicca of the university of genoa was used mentaschi et al 2015 the databased was reconstructed employing forcing the wavewatch iii model with wrf model reanalysis data and it was validated in the north thyrrhenian sea using the entire set of records from the italian national wave measurement network ron the red exterior redext buoys and a set of buoys from the greek poseidon network mentaschi et al 2013b a 2015 the dicca dataset is comprehensive of hourly unimodal marine hindcast for the whole mediterranean sea on a 10 km grid from the 1st january 1979 to the 31st december 2019 the available data include among the others 1 timestamp 2 significant wave height h s 3 mean wave period t 1 4 average wave direction θ m 5 average wave directional spreading θ s to reduce the dimensions of the hindcast analysis problem the data were discretised in 45deg steps 8 angular sectors with wave heights and periods every 1m and 1s respectively the discretization was carried out for all the route s waypoints and the probability of occurrence of each sea state combination was calculated and stored fig 14 shows the polar distribution of the wave height half way through the route at point id 933 of the wavewatch iii grid fig 15 shows the discretization of the hindcast sea states for the 8 angular sectors the full directional wave spectra are known to yield more accurate ship response results against the unimodal parametric reconstructions due to their superior representation of the natural seaway spentza et al 2017 portilla yandún et al 2019 for this reason a full wave energy density spectrum was reconstructed from each combination of wave height mean period and mean direction and for all of the waypoints yielding a total of 7 605 spectra for limited fetch areas the jonswap spectrum is the most suitable statistical representation of the seaway energy hasselmann et al 1973 corsini et al 2006 the jonswap spectrum is defined as 9 s ζ ω s p m ω γ θ ω where ω is the angular frequency of the wave components γ is the spectral peak enhancement factor s p m ω is the pierson moskovitz spectrum and θ ω is a filtering function having the maximum in correspondence of the spectral peak frequency the latter is defined as 10 θ ω exp 1 2 ω ω p σ ω p 2 where ω p is the peak spectral frequency and σ is the peak width parameter which defines the cut off frequency bands and is defined as 11 σ σ a if ω ω p σ b if ω ω p in the present work the values of γ σ a and σ b were assigned based on statistics of the italian wave atlas for the la spezia ron wave buoy corsini et al 2006 yielding 12a γ 2 02 12b σ a 0 10 12c σ b 0 07 a conventional cosine

in table 3 was then combined with the probabilistic wave spectra for the two directions of travel of the genoa port torres route hereby named northbound and southbound directions the total number of assessed combinations is therefore 7 605 7 2 106 470 the spectral analyses were conducted following the customary theory and notation the ordinate of the i th motion energy density spectrum is calculated as a function of the wave frequency ω and wave angle of encounter μ as follows 18 s ϰ i 0 ω μ s ζ ω μ r i 2 ω μ where s ζ ω μ and r i ω μ represent respectively the wave energy density spectrum and the i th rao as a function of wave frequency and wave angle of encounter the zero th spectral moment or variance of s ϰ i 0 is defined as 19 m i 0 0 0 2 π s ϰ i 0 d μ d ω the significant

ω 22 a 2 m i 4 the on board comfort is evaluated in this paper by employing the iso 2631 1 msi level definition which was calculated from the vertical accelerations at the defined deck location according to the following equation iso 1997 23 m s i k m m s d v where similarly to eq 3 the msdv is defined as iso 1997 24 m s d v 0 t x 3 2 t d t where t is the duration of the motion exposure in accordance with the literature a fixed exposure time of 2 h tezdogan et al 2014 and k m 1 3 which defines a mixed population of unadapted males and females were adopted iso 1997 it should be remembered that due to the consistent assumptions of its derivation the msi does not give a necessarily accurate estimation of the percentage of the on board population that will be subjected to emesis it will however serve as a good relative indicator of the ride comfort lloyd 1989 for this reason no thresholds were associated to the msi values although msi levels ranging 20 35 may generally be held as critical o hanlon and mccauley 1974 3 results and discussion to limit the amount of plots presented in this section where deemed necessary the results have been presented for a selected number of waypoints these are represented in fig 17 alongside all the other waypoints used in the analyses see fig 18 as expected the results show an evident correlation between the sea conditions the ship size and the msi the average msi over the genoa port torres route is reported for every ship as a function of the significant wave height h s and the mean wave period t m in fig 19 the figure shows a nearly linear relationship between the msi and the wave height and a second order relationship with the mean period the increasing size of the vessel reduces the slope and hence the overall values of the h s m s i function and shifts the peak of the t m m s i function towards higher t m values these are consequences respectively of the increasing inertial forces with respect to the froude krylov forces and of the natural frequency of the ship moving to lower frequencies the scatter noticed in the calculated datapoints is due to the different angles of encounter of the seaway the significant wave height can be converted to a degree of the world meteorological organization sea state code i e douglas scale since the msi also depends on wave period and direction the relationship with the sea state is not univocal the msi values can be averaged for each douglas scale degree to provide a sea state msi relationship fig 20 shows average values of msi plotted against the sea state that produced them for all representative ships the observations made for fig 19 are here more apparent and highlight the impact of ship size on the msi scale from a spatial viewpoint the weather intensity and hence the ship comfort vary considerably along the genoa port torres route owing to the topography and bathymetry of the area figs 20 and 21 show respectively the average and maximum msi values at each waypoint for all representative ships besides the ship size effect it is observed that the msi values are smaller towards the ports and reach a peak roughly half way through the route in particular it can be noticed that the average msi of fig 20 increases almost linearly up to waypoint wp 13 and almost stabilises until wp 31 before dropping nearer to the sardinian shore this observation indicates a sheltering nature of the ligurian sea against the predominant south western wave systems corsini et al 2006 a closer insight into the effect of the wave system directions and their probability is provided by the polar diagrams in fig 22 obtained at waypoint wp 14 the polar plots show the percentage probability of each representative ship to produce certain msi values depending on the mean wave direction and the ship course hereby referred to as northbound and southbound these polar plots are coherent with the wave height polar distribution of fig 14 which confirms the predominance of south western seas because of the strong effects that the global heave and pitch motions have on the local heave acceleration the highest msi values are observed for northerly and southerly seas which fall either in the bow or stern sectors it is also noted that the plots present little differences between northbound and southbound courses and higher msi values are not always encountered for bow seas this is likely due to the average wave encountering frequencies approaching the natural frequencies ω e ω 1 in the different combinations of ship sizes and directions the effect of location and course direction on the ship comfort can be observed from the probability distributions of fig 23 at each of the observation waypoints see fig 17 the msi histograms of the representative ship with highest probability on the genoa port torres route m v sharden are here plotted for the two courses northbound and southbound the msi distribution is observed to follow an approximate rayleigh probability density function which is a consequence of its strong correlation with the wave height distribution the differences in msi probability between the two courses are generally negligible 0 05 with the exception of wp 8 and wp 14 where the southbound course shows stronger probabilities of reaching higher msi values this is in agreement with the observations made for fig 22 in addition the higher msi values observed for the middle of the route in fig 20 can be observed from the increased probability associated to the higher msi values around wp 14 wp 20 and wp 26 overall it can be observed that the m v sharden is mostly subjected to msi values in the order of 5 on average a global perspective on all the vessel sizes can instead be gained from fig 24 where the msi probability distribution for all representative vessels is plotted the histogram clearly shows the upward shift of the mean msi values with the increasing vessel size in general the msi values are in the range 0 10 with relatively smaller ships 150m extending the range to 15 rare events can be seen to provoke msi of 20 and greater a more detailed overview is given in tables 5 and 6 which report respectively the average and maximum msi values for all the representative ships and all the wave origin sectors on average the msi values for the smaller vessels 150m is settled around 12 whereas it is about half for the larger ships while this is a relatively high value it must be placed in the context of the characteristics of the maritime traffic on the genoa port torres route fig 7 and table 3 showed that the smallest ships are related to almost negligible probabilities on the route making relatively rare the occurrence of the high msi values of small vessels in tables 5 and 6 from a weather direction point of view the most uncomfortable journeys seem instead to occur with south westerly and westerly seas while south easterly weather has a milder effect on the route globally the average msi is about 8 which is generally acceptable although it is not uncommon to witness ferry trip cancellations with like msi values the global maximum msi level was calculated at about 35 which is close to the maximum achievable with accelerations in the orderof 1 m s 2 4 conclusions this paper successfully presented a probabilistic method to evaluate the passenger comfort quality in terms of the motion sickness incidence msi index when sailing on a commercial route to the best knowledge of the authors this paper represents the first probabilistic assessment of the kind which makes use of real navigational data ais for the characterization of the route and of accurate wave atlases for the probabilistic assessment of the marine weather a large commercial passenger route genoa port torres was identified employing a kde analysis of a six months dataset of ais data and characterized by identifying its most representative ships with defined ship size families the seakeeping characteristics of all representative ships were calculated by means of a strip theory code for a range of regular wave frequencies and bearing angles state of the art wave atlases comprehensive of 40 years of hourly hindcast data were employed to obtain a probabilistic representation of the seaway in the proximity of the route full directional spectra were then reconstructed for discretised combinations of wave height wave period and direction the ship responses along the route were calculated at each location for all representative ships and all marine weather combinations finally the sailing comfort was then evaluated by calculating the msi according to the iso 2361 formulation iso 1997 the following conclusions can be drawn the analysis of ais data essential for the investigation of the actual maritime traffic and allows to characterise the ships sailing on each route from real navigational data up to date comprehensive wave hindcast data allows a detailed assessment of the wave statistics which can be profitably used to calculate realistic ship responses for a range of applications the analysis of the vessel responses in relation with the sea intensity allows to associate different comfort levels to a sea state degree depending on the ship and location the msi analysis also allows to identify the most critical locations and ship sizes for the ride comfort of the selected route in relation with its statistical wave properties overall the analysis show that the genoa port torres route is generally a reasonably comfortable route particularly for the larger vessels 150m which appear to be the most frequently observed on the route future work will be oriented on the following subjects implementation of more accurate seakeeping theories selection of suitable msi thresholds to provide warning indications and clear design criteria assessment of a larger number of routes and ship types for a more comprehensive classification of the maritime traffic implementation of more indicators to include other weather effects on the ship behaviour application of the method presented in this paper to a ship design case study credit
