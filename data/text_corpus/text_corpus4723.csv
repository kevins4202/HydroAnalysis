23615,the design of reliable station keeping systems for permanent floating structures such as offshore renewable energy devices is vital to their lifelong integrity in highly dynamic and or deep water applications including hydrodynamics and structural dynamics in the mooring analysis is paramount for the accurate prediction of the loading on the lines and hence their dimensioning this article presents a new workflow based on edf r d s open source finite element analysis tool code aster enabling the dynamic analysis of catenary mooring systems with application to a floating wind turbine concept the university of maine deepcwind oc4 basin test campaign is used for validation showing that code aster can satisfactorily predict the fairlead tensions in both regular and irregular waves in the latter case all of the three main spectral components of tension observed in the experiments are found numerically also the dynamic line tension is systematically compared with that provided by the classic quasi static approach thereby confirming its limitations robust dynamic simulation of catenary moorings is shown to be possible using this generalist finite element software provided that the inputs be organised consistently with the physics of offshore hydromechanics keywords moorings dynamics finite element code aster floating wind oc4 1 introduction floating wind turbine fwt technology permits to access deep water offshore wind resources up to depths of a few hundred metres whilst it has already been demonstrated at the mw scale through a handful of prototypes its industrialisation is just beginning considerable challenges lie ahead due to the limited experience available in coupling a wind turbine generator to a floating structure producing cost effective integrated fwt designs will likely require a profound revision of engineering practices and quite possibly the adoption of radically innovative solutions before standardisation 1 1 mooring system the station keeping of a fwt is achieved by transferring the mean horizontal loads dominated by wind thrust to the seabed the mooring system defined as the ensemble of components involved in the load path from the fairleads to the soil must be designed to resist cyclical and extreme loads with adequate safety and if required redundancy for a general introduction to offshore mooring systems and their functions design and certification the reader may refer to chakrabarti 2005 offshore mooring systems commonly use the catenary principle fig 1 a to produce horizontal restoring forces exploiting the gravitational potential of heavy suspended lines on the contrary the restoring power of taut mooring arrangements fig 1b relies primarily on their elasticity in fwt applications the choice of mooring solution is primarily linked to water depth and floater technology and deeply impacts system design as well as marine operations and the risk structure of a project whilst the mw scale fwt prototypes installed to date hywind windfloat and the units installed off goto and fukushima employ slack chain moorings semi taut taut or tensioned arrangements are also considered for upcoming floating wind applications castro santos et al 2013 examples of taut mooring solutions using mainly fibre rope are found for instance within the early dcns sea reed design and the ideol floatgen demonstrator in these cases nylon has been favoured over other fibres in order to insure sufficiently soft behaviour in very shallow water 30 40 m where conventional arrangements become too stiff other configurations tailored for mid shallow waters have been studied such as catenary with clump weights e g vertiwind concept or the multi node gustomsc patented system de boom 2011 turbine weathervaning by mooring design may eliminate the need for an active nacelle yawing system and or attenuate loads on the floater for this sake single point fwt mooring systems have been devised using a turret e g eolink and saitec concepts or single anchor leg moorings finally tensioned systems have been investigated in order to reduce stability demand on the floater leading to the design of the sbm glosten pelastar and gicon tension leg platform systems as imaginable the properties of the mooring system define the dynamic response features of the whole system appropriately stiff or compliant behaviour in different degrees of freedom as well as the avoidance of resonance can be obtained by intervening on the mooring arrangement the design of a floating wind farm mooring system that is low maintenance sufficiently reliable and optimised for cost challenges the existing practices and holds large potential for improvement by r d considering that a permanent floating structure s very survivability depends on the integrity of its moorings a thorough understanding of their mechanical behaviour in the highly dynamic conditions found offshore is fundamental 1 2 numerical modelling of floating wind turbine moorings in the floating offshore structure industry both frequency and time domain numerical tools are used for the estimate of platform and mostly platform driven mooring response the less computationally intensive frequency domain methods treat wave frequency and low frequency wave loads and responses separately typically employing linear and quadratic wave force transfer functions qtf to define the excitation term of the platform s rigid body eom equations of motion this approach valid when non linearities other than those treated with qtf are modest is commonly applied to conventional offshore structures especially in early design stages and for large design load case dlc sets notably fatigue in floating wind the addition of wind and turbine related excitation at its own range of frequencies as well as the non linearities caused by the reduced size of structures calls for time domain solvers at earlier design stages in this case all physics can be treated at once in coupled fashion albeit at higher computational cost concerning the effect of the mooring system on platform motions in frequency versus time domain dynamic mooring model comparisons it is common to observe relative conservatism in frequency domain results due to absence of mooring damping cf for example stendal 2015 conversely mooring tensions may be underestimated by frequency domain solvers as they typically miss line bound inertial and hydrodynamic effects as discussed below after half a century of offshore engineering experience the role of dynamics in the mechanical behaviour of mooring systems is vastly documented it is commonly accepted that the quasi static representation of mooring lines becomes too inaccurate for the sake of engineering design when the motions of the structure are highly dynamic when drag intensive components are used for instance a mooring chain when water depth exceeds about 150 m or with any combination of the above matha et al 2011 in such cases the inertial hydrodynamic and seabed contact loads can govern the extreme and cyclical tension regimes on the lines dynamic effects can dominate the tension variance especially in domains where high energy and high compliance coexist this typically applies to conventional deep water offshore platforms mavrakos et al 1996 and to highly dynamic applications such as marine renewable energy installations johanning et al 2007 as a consequence the current state of the art time domain software for the design and analysis of offshore mooring systems e g orcaflex anysim flexcom fastlink 1 1 a simulator coupling nrel s code fast and orcaflex etc typically include dynamic simulation capabilities the above guidelines are readily transposed to the floating wind context and dictate the use of dynamic simulation tools especially when focussing on the mechanical response of the mooring system past research see for example karimirad 2013 has shown that the dynamic mooring effects tend to bear a limited impact on fwt motion due to the economical limitations to the practicable water depth presently a few hundred metres at the most yet even in these conditions the impact on platform motion may become observable in extreme sea states as pointed out by masciola et al 2013 increasing the water depth rapidly augments the sensitivity of platform motion to the mooring dynamics as reported by matha et al 2011 for instance a lumped mass model is used by lin 2015 to simulate the dynamics of a spar fwt with catenary chains for increasing water depths 320 600 and 900 m confirming the growing importance of dynamic line tension in determining the global response a different picture can be drawn for the dynamic effects on mooring line tension among others coulling et al 2013 and masciola et al 2013 demonstrate that the quasi static tensions severely underestimate experimental measurements even at the limited depth of 200 m and for operational met ocean conditions a recent review of the available dynamic mooring line theories is provided by masciola et al 2014 distinguishing three main categories lumped mass finite difference and finite element literature shows that both the popular finite element and lumped mass theories can provide accurate tension predictions although with more stringent resolution requirements by the latter approach lin 2015 masciola et al 2014 the finite element fe method has been chosen by numerous authors in the fwt modelling field a study by jeon et al 2013 evaluates the response of a spar type fwt using a catenary system evidencing the extensional vibrations of the mooring lines the dynamics of large multi turbine platforms are analysed by kallesoe et al 2011 and by kim et al 2015 incorporating a fe moorings model finite bar type elements are used in the coupled simulations of cheng et al 2015 to assess different vawt arrangements and by bachynski et al 2013 to determine the severity of transient fault related events on mooring tension coupled motion response and dynamic mooring tensions are obtained by zhang et al 2013 for a mw sized hawt on a small semi submersible platform also using the fe method the global effect of the hydrodynamic damping forces exerted on the mooring lines is characterised in the work of hall et al 2011 for a spar fwt using a nonlinear bar model a tension leg system is also studied with the fe approach by bae and kim 2013 allowing to bring out the effects of 2nd order sum frequency wave excitation on structural response the outputs of coupled simulation software using a range of different mooring theories are benchmarked in a report by jonkman et al 2010 a promising alternative for the representation of mooring dynamics is the multi body formulation as maintained by borg et al 2012 and muskulus 2011 which may enable a reduction of computational effort compared to fe resolutions for example matha et al 2011 use this modelling option to show the onset of hydrodynamic non linearities in the behaviour of a fwt due to mooring dynamics 1 3 code aster code aster is edf r d s all purpose open source fe solver for the thermo mechanical study of structures edf 2014 after over 20 years of development this software offers in the order of 400 finite element typologies for the discretisation of solids and a broad range of solvers all features which are thoroughly tested and validated it enables the static dynamic and vibrational analysis of mechanically loaded structures as well as modal analysis the current study looks to employ the nonlinear capabilities of this software to represent the dynamic behaviour of floating wind turbine mooring lines which are intrinsically characterised by nonlinear kinematics due to the presence of large displacements and intermittent seabed contact the features peculiar of mooring system modelling which are not readily available in the classic code aster workflow have been implemented by manually augmenting the command file with the necessary scripts and by developing practical methodologies based on appropriate sequences of simulations although code aster is written in french language the interested anglophone reader can acquire a grip on this software by consulting specialised wiki pages which provide examples and tutorials see for instance caelinux 2015 two related manuscripts have also been recently published which are rich in hands on examples thakore 2014a b the version of the software employed for this study is 12 2 10 development release 1 4 deepcwind oc4 experimental campaign an experimental campaign led by the university of maine was conducted at marin s wind and wave basin with the aim of calibrating and validating a coupled fwt dynamic simulator based on nrel s fast its outcomes are documented by published work by masciola et al 2013 and coulling et al 2013 where the outputs of different numerical implementations are compared to the measurements other authors have recently utilised this campaign for validation using both the fe koo et al 2014 and lumped mass hall and goupee 2015 simulation approaches the object of this campaign is a 1 50 th scale model of the deepcwind oc4 fwt fig 2 which consists in a scaled nrel 5 mw aerogenerator mounted on a three column semi submersible platform operating at an equivalent water depth of 200 m included in the physical model is a downscaled mooring system realised with a brass chain which closely resembles the full scale three leg arrangement specified in robertson et al 2014 load cells mounted at the fairleads provide the mooring tension signal the experiments carried out at the marin facility include free decay pull out wind only wave only and coupled wind wave tests the numerical model benchmarks clearly exhibit the limitations of the quasi static mooring model when it comes to assessing the dynamic tension ranges 1 5 selected validation data a subset of the experiments introduced in 1 4 is here used to validate the presented dynamic simulator published mooring tensions in coulling et al 2013 only treat purely hydrodynamic load cases with turbine parked and no wind for the sake of progressive model validation the same environmental conditions are applied in this work as a first step full environments including wind and turbine operational loads will be part of future work with verification possibly starting from a benchmark versus comparable tools such as nrel fast v8 using moordyn and validation from the comparison with further experimental outputs presented in goupee et al 2014 2 methodology the finite element method enables the spatial discretisation of a continuum reducing the degrees of freedom dof of a solid to a finite set which can be treated numerically a corresponding set of equations written with respect to the system s nodal dof is then used to seek the static or dynamic equilibrium configuration of the structure under any given combination of external loads and constraints 2 1 one dimensional discretisation the centrepiece of the proposed methodology is the homogeneous 1d finite element denoted cable available in code aster which was originally developed to simulate the mechanical behaviour of overhead electrical lines fléjou 2014 this two node element is a version of the classic bar element adapted to the large displacement context this makes it suitable for representing highly compliant mooring lines as discussed above bars are only one of many modelling possibilities a simpler and widespread option for dynamic mooring modelling is the lumped mass with spring and damper connections which requires higher mesh resolution whether this approach can be successfully implemented in code aster remains to be investigated on the opposite side the next fe type in terms of complexity is the beam large displacement beams are available in code aster which may be used to model mooring lines characterised by significant bending torsional or shear resistance but have been shown to be prone to error accumulation when undergoing repeated large rotations they also prove overcomplex when the mooring line s dominant mechanical resistance is axial a beneficial feature of bar elements with respect to beams is in fact the halving of the global dof at the nodes rotational dof are unassigned which preserves computational efficiency it should be noted that the absence of rotational reactions which characterises the cable is a reasonable modelling hypothesis only for line types which oppose negligible resistance to bending and torsion whilst this is generally accepted for chains orcina 2013 the behaviour of less flexible lines operating at low tension such as short and stiff rope segments may not be accurately represented under this assumption especially in the vicinity of rotational constraints focussing on bending and assuming a linear isotropic material and a constant line section the classic beam theory provides the governing parameter which if large enough causes elastic behaviour the segment s relative bending stiffness e i l this is defined by the material s young s modulus e the sectional bending inertia i and the characteristic length of the segment l in presence of a low homogeneous tension t this term may no longer be marginal with respect to the contribution of geometric bending stiffness which is proportional to t l and usually dominant in the reactive balance of a tensioned mooring line the underlying assumption of bending soft segments may be then written as e i l t l 2 1 1 finite element constitution a cable finite element is defined as a straight segment of length l with a constant cross section of area a the element s sections are supposed to be undeformable and to maintain a constant orientation in the local frame used in 3d space a cable disposes of six nodal dof in the global inertial system of reference which correspond to the nodal translations q e q n 1 q n 2 fig 3 linear shape functions l are used to express the internal displacement vector u in the global frame as a function of the normalised axial position on the element ξ s l as 1 u ξ l q e using 2 l 1 ξ 0 0 ξ 0 0 0 1 ξ 0 0 ξ 0 0 0 1 ξ 0 0 ξ the mechanical tensors describing a system of interconnected cables can be obtained by applying the lagrange equations and hence assembling the dof matched individual element contributions no basis changes are necessary thanks to the purely translational constitution of this element type which allows to write the kinematics directly in the common global frame 2 2 large displacements the presence of large displacements whether due to deformation or rigid body kinematics introduces a nonlinearity in solid mechanics causing the classic linearised methods to lose their ability to accurately describe the displaced configuration of the structure when the finite element method is used writing the rotation kinematics is also more complex because large rotations in 3d space cannot be represented with a vector they become in fact non commutative and must be treated with more complex methods such euler angles or quaternions de soza 2014 in the present model this only affects the support beam elements see 3 3 since the rotations of the cable elements take place implicitly following the nodal displacements code aster treats large displacements with the updated lagrangian method ul originally introduced by bathe and bolourchi 1979 which operates a reactualisation of the structure s geometry at every newton raphson iteration contrary to the classic static representation of matrices in linear solid mechanics the assembled system matrices are continuously recalculated an example application of the updated lagrangian method to a 1d element is next given with reference to fig 4 the structure s response is represented in the global inertial system of reference o xyz whilst the cable axial deformation takes place along s in the local frame ps we may define the initial undeformed state of the element with the numeral 0 identifying an initial frame p0s0 and an element length l 0 it is then assumed that a new equilibrium must be found for the next instant in time which is characterised by a different loading state let the configuration denoted with 1 be reached after a first newton raphson iteration takes place the new coordinate s 1 will then be associated to the internal strain of the element in the next iteration whilst the local deformation is reset to zero as the new configuration with length l 1 becomes the reference geometry the new reference stress state must naturally be nonzero to account for past strain in the definition of the element s geometric stiffness de soza 2014 the following newton raphson iteration is carried out by recalculating the system tangent matrix in the new configuration leading to the next displacement guess at 2 the procedure is repeated until convergence is achieved within the time step 2 3 seabed contact the interaction of a mooring line with the seabed is a complex subject which interfaces structural and geotechnical engineering the state of the art seabed theory proposes a combination of two non linear dissipative phenomena for the representation of the reactive soil forces lateral friction and uplift repenetration resistance orcina 2013 a model of this type is expected to provide a representation of seabed interaction which is accurate enough for the assessment of the fatigue life of mooring segments located around the touchdown point according to randolph and quiggin 2009 in the present study a smooth and rigid seabed model is used instead which reduces contact to a reversible conservative phenomenon among the contact modelling options available in code aster this is the simplest and most robust the introduction of dissipative contact is possible in code aster and may be sought by further work this will likely require the creation of shell elements to represent the seabed and the assignment of a master slave hierarchy between the mooring line elements and said shells see the relevant documentation by de soza 2015 under the current hypotheses the two variables governing surface contact are d the clearance between the structure e g a node and the contact surface and σ the normal contact stress the hertz signorini moreau contact conditions are introduced see for example yastrebov 2011 impenetrability kinematic condition d 0 non negative contact stress dynamic cond σ 0 complementarity energetic condition d σ 0 the resulting unilateral contact law is then expressed as 3 d 0 σ 0 d σ 0 which is satisfied in the domain visualised in fig 5 the positive semi definite d σ relationship found is non univocal and is not differentiable in d σ 0 these features make it a non trivial numerical implementation unilateral contact is introduced in the model as a constrained optimisation problem using karush kuhn tucker kkt conditions weisstein 2015 which are in practice applied to an arbitrary set of nodal dof abbas 2015 on the user side the unilateral boundary condition is imposed by applying an analytically defined inequality to the nodal displacements when touch down contact over a flat seabed located at z h is considered this assumes the form 4 δ z h z 0 in the above expression δ z denotes the cumulated vertical displacement of a node over the simulation and z 0 its initial vertical coordinate 2 4 mooring line hydrodynamics the morison approach is employed in the form detailed next to compute the hydrodynamic forces on the lines by taking into account both the structure s motion and the wave kinematics first a simplification is made by disregarding the inertial wave forces due to the small diameter of the mooring lines compared to the length of ocean waves these are negligible with respect to viscous forces the same modelling hypothesis is used by commercial mooring simulation software such as anysim marin 2011 the morison equation term associated to the fluid s added mass force is accounted for in reactive form with the procedure outlined in 2 4 2 and removed from the external loads this leaves only drag in the morison equation which is computed as follows the mooring line is assimilated to a circular cylinder of equivalent volume whose diameter is d the mooring line s volumetric diameter an arbitrarily oriented orthonormal frame p x y z with x s is assigned for the decomposition of velocity unit vectors i j and k define the directions of axes x y and z in the global frame respectively following from 2 1 1 let u denote the instantaneous position of a section and v the absolute flow velocity at the section s location in the fluid the relative flow velocity is defined by w v u subsequently the axial and normal components of vector w are with respect to the element s frame 5 w x w i w y w j w z w k this enables the decomposition of the drag problem of a porous 1d body in 3d space such as a mooring chain the axial drag force per unit length is written as 6 d f x d l 1 2 ρ w c d a d w x w x the transverse component of the relative velocity defined with 7 w n w w x i enters the computation of the normal drag force 8 d f y d l 1 2 ρ w c d n d w n w y d f z d l 1 2 ρ w c d n d w n w z note that the axial declination of this formula uses the same reference diameter as the normal one this is customary in mooring analysis and requires a consistent choice of c d a and c d n equations 6 and 8 can also be written equivalently with reference to the nominal line diameter which corresponds to the bar diameter for a mooring chain 2 4 1 viscous forces equations 6 and 8 represent the viscous drag forces which dominate wave structure interaction for slender bodies such as mooring lines and enter the global eom as a time and displacement dependent excitation term normal and axial drag forces are treated as distributed loads and their integral over the length of each element is approximated using the gauss method using n gauss points enables to compute force distributions up to the 2 n 1 th order in the present application n 3 is used which should suffice to capture correctly the drag force variability over mooring segments of limited length in order to do this the local speed u is calculated at each of the gauss points by interpolation between the extremity nodes whilst v is obtained using the incident wave particle kinematics providing the local drag force per unit length the integration of the approximating polynomial times the element shape function finally yields the equivalent nodal forces which enter the dynamic equilibrium equation after being reexpressed in the global system of reference 2 4 2 inertial forces the inertial fluid reactions may play a significant role in determining a line s dynamic response since they contribute to the effective modal mass for a standard steel chain for example added mass represents about a tenth of the normal modal mass this is why the reactive part of the inertial hydrodynamic force is considered here by means of a left hand side lhs added mass force based on the methods commonly employed by industrial software e g marin 2011 orcina 2013 the axial flow and normal flow added masses of a slender mooring segment are respectively expressed with 9 m a a c a a ρ w m a n c a n ρ w this formula employs the volumetric acception of the added mass coefficient c a the other defining parameters are water density ρ w and the segment volume as it will be shown in 3 1 the hydrodynamic added mass is here summed to the mechanical mass of the cables by an increase of material density this corresponds to assuming m a a m a n m a which in principle is incorrect for example for mooring chains a reasonable normal to tangential added mass ratio is in the order of 3 see marin 2011 fortunately far from the fairlead excitation the dynamic displacements of pre tensioned mooring chain segments take place mostly in the transverse direction reflecting the low modes of a slender and axially stiff structure it is therefore reasonable to calibrate c a on the normal added mass at the expense of the representation of axial fluid reaction 3 model set up next are presented the user side procedures which enable to carry out mooring simulations with code aster these start with the selection of an appropriate combination of physical parameters for the simultaneous representation of gravitational buoyancy structural inertial and hydrodynamic added mass forces on the lines then the catenary laying procedure is explained which initialises the mooring simulation the representation of the floating platform with its rigid body dynamics is also briefly outlined finally an account is made of the selection of the time integration scheme 3 1 chain equivalent element in this type of model mooring chains need to be assimilated to homogeneous 1d elements their complex geometry and the presence of articulated joints fig 6 translate in large longitudinal variations of the mechanical properties at the link scale in order to correctly represent a mooring chain segment with a bar type element these attributes must be expressed in longitudinally averaged form a homogeneous cable element is defined by the material specific quantities e c and e c the young s moduli associated to tension and compression and the volumetric mass ρ c the following geometrical quantities also concur in defining the element a c the element s sectional area and l c its span among these parameters e c is set to zero for a chain see orcina 2013 whilst l c is dictated by the input mesh for each element to determine the remaining parameters the modeller must pay attention to the following aspects axial stiffness the nominal axial stiffness found in the chain specifications κ must be respected by the equivalent cable element that is κ c e c a c κ inertial mass per unit length another catalogue parameter is ϱ the chain s average mass per unit length in order to assign the correct mass to the equivalent cable for the computation of inertial forces one must satisfy ρ m a c ϱ with ρ m denoting the chain material s density the above relations combined identify the equivalent cable s sectional area and young s modulus as 10 a c ϱ ρ m e c κ a c κ ρ m ϱ note that the quantities found with equation 10 must be distinguished from the physical chain s geometric and material properties since in the present implementation the reactive added mass force is approximated with an isotropic increase of inertial mass see 2 4 an according correction on material density is introduced let ρ w be the water density and c a the volumetric added mass coefficient the input equivalent cable density becomes 11 ρ c ρ m c a ρ w the corrected gravitational acceleration to be applied on the lines in the numerical simulation is obtained with 12 g c g 1 c a 1 c a ρ m ρ w as demonstrated by antonutti 2015 which insures the representation of the correct weight force per unit length inclusive of the buoyancy force 3 2 catenary laying finding the static equilibrium configuration of highly flexible structures such as offshore moorings is a known numerical challenge in finite element analysis see for instance webster 1980 if one excludes the pre generation of the equilibrium geometry using catenary formulae the above translates into finding a gravitationally loaded static equilibrium configuration with code aster which is far removed from an arbitrarily chosen initial geometry the strategy proposed here to solve this problem and initialise the mooring simulation is described next for a single mooring line let f and a be the fairlead and anchor point whose location in space is known assuming l the unstretched mooring line length as input a convenient starting geometry is obtained by breaking the mooring line into two straight segments 2 2 defining the initial mooring line geometry as a set of straight lines in space is functional to both mesh generation and the imposition of the unilateral contact laws of 2 3 in analytical form ak and kf lying in the vertical plane which contains a and f with 13 ak kf l this defines the initial configuration ω i shown in fig 7 the target static equilibrium configuration ω s also appears in the figure from the starting state ω i the quasi static solver available in code aster cannot approach ω s through a sequence of quasi static solutions with increasing excitation since the equilibrium geometry neglecting elastic deformation is the same for any magnitude of the gravitational forcing in the case of catenary laying the system must find the equilibrium state mostly by rigid body displacement unfortunately quasi free rigid body motion is characterised by a singular tangent stiffness matrix which makes the problem untractable with the quasi static solver in such cases using the dynamic solver permits to reestablish the equilibrium between internal and external forces thanks to the contribution of inertia and damping to the tangent matrix introducing inertia alone stabilises the calculation but cannot provide the motion decay required to attain ω s a source of dissipation is needed to remove the potential energy differential between ω i and ω s from the system this is achieved with the introduction of a controlled amount of rayleigh damping after imposing the gravitational load clump boundary conditions in f and a and the seabed contact condition a decaying dynamic simulation with near critical damping may be obtained such a simulation generally leads to a satisfactory approximation of ω s in a few tens of seconds simulation time at the end a one step static simulation is run using ω s as input in order to eliminate any spurious dynamic effect its output ω 0 ω t 0 is used to initialise the subsequent simulations of physical interest 3 3 floating platform geometry and dynamics studying the mechanics of a complete fwt mooring system requires to link the fairlead points to simulate the presence of the floater a rigid platform model is presently utilised for this sake which consists in a set of massless undeformable beam elements see fléjou 2015 for a description of beam elements in code aster each connecting a fairlead to the platform pivoting point first a motion driven approach is proposed the platform hydromechanics are solved with edf r d s time domain simulator calhypso see antonutti et al 2016 for a description of this software which provides the six dof motion response signals these are applied within code aster as a time dependent boundary condition located on the platform reference node in this case the feedback loop between platform dynamics and the dynamic component of the mooring system s response is not represented see for instance ormberg and larsen 1998 in qualitative terms the severity of this limitation is proportional to the relative size of the mooring system with respect to the floater which is governed by water depth dnv 2013b lin 2015 the dynamically uncoupled approach used in this study seeks to contain the retroaction inaccuracy through the use of a quasi static nonlinear mooring model in calhypso but cannot include any dynamic mooring retroactions such as additional dampening of platform motions if the platform dynamics are not imposed and need instead to resolved independently by code aster in a coupled simulation a rigid hydromechanical floating structure model is introduced in the fe environment this is done by lumping the aggregate structure mass and hydrostatic stiffness tensors defined at the floating structure s equilibrium m and k h onto a 6 dof punctual 0d element see fléjou 2013 where the incident wave excitation f t is also applied only harmonic regular wave simulations can be organised with this method since the convolution treatment of aharmonic wave radiation forces is unavailable by assuming that motion is monochromatic and that its frequency equals that of the incident wave ω these forces may be represented in the lhs by assigning frequency independent linear added mass and damping tensors to the above defined 0d element a ω and b ω based on the outputs of the frequency domain radiation calculation 3 3 for both calhypso and code aster the frequency domain hydrodynamic data base formed by f ω arg f ω a ω and b ω is obtained upfront using nemoh of the ecole centrale de nantes see babarit and delhommeau 2015 which solves the linear wave diffraction and radiation problems via the panel method finally the hull drag forces are imposed on the structure using an extra set of rigidly connected massless beams and the method of 2 4 1 please refer to section 5 for a definition of the labels used for the different dynamic approaches in the following 3 4 numerical damping dynamic mooring analyses aim to precisely represent low frequencies wave excitation and mooring line modes and tend to be affected by parasitic high frequency oscillations caused by the system non linearities this is a common problem in structural mechanics often addressed via controlled numerical damping in particular hilber et al 1977 proposed a dissipative time integration scheme of the newmark family commonly referred to as hht which introduces low numerical damping in the low frequency band and high damping at high frequency thereby allowing to stabilise the simulation for the above reasons the hht integration scheme is recommended for the dynamic treatment of cable elements in code aster especially in the presence of contact shocks fléjou 2014 greffet 2011 in the applications presented in section 5 a viable value of the numerical damping parameter was chosen by gradually increasing its magnitude until the fairlead tension the reference output signal became free of high frequency noise 4 validation cases static validation cases for the presented code aster workflow are provided by antonutti 2015 next the focus will be placed on dynamic mooring simulation with reference to the deepcwind oc4 basin tests among the variety of loading cases presented in masciola et al 2013 it is here chosen to model the subset for which the authors provide experimental fairlead tension data this corresponds to six regular wave scenarios here denoted with letters b to g plus an irregular wave case another low energy regular wave scenario a is reproduced from coulling et al 2013 in these tests wavetrains of varying properties are sent over the structure in the negative x direction consistently with fig 2 this campaign is focussed on highly energetic sea states representing extreme oceanic conditions which should help bring out the dynamic features of the mooring system tables 1 and 2 define the loading cases considered using full scale dimensions the regular waves used to excite the structure are moderately steep causing them to fall into the 2nd order stokes field of the classic wave theory classification see le méhauté 1976 a relatively low peak enhancement factor equalling 2 2 is used in the irregular wave case following the experiments carried out at marin note that the intensity of the highest wave conditions considered reaches levels which are typical of 50 year return period oceanic conditions which are used as the minimum ultimate limit state reference by mainstream floating wind standards by abs 2013 bv 2015 and dnv 2013a 4 1 numerical model parameters the reference study compares experimental and numerical outputs at the full scale which is also adopted here the geometric parameters of the oc4 floater see fig 2 are given in table 3 the aggregated mass and inertia properties of the floating system are provided in table 4 since all the considered loading cases feature a parked turbine which intervenes in the model as a rigid onboard mass it is not necessary to reproduce the wind turbine particulars in greater detail the mooring system geometry is identical to that presented for the full scale deepcwind turbine in robertson et al 2014 designed for a water depth of 200 m and readily described with the parameters of table 5 the physical model s mooring chain properties brought to full scale are provided with table 6 the reported drag coefficients are assigned based on the values proposed by marin 2011 for standard full scale chains whilst the volumetric added mass coefficient is set to unit consistently with masciola et al 2013 the gravitational equilibrium requirement is satisfied by countering the undisturbed mooring line weight with an equal vertical force applied at each fairlead this reintroduces the need to represent the stabilising effect of the mooring system weight with a corresponding gravitational correction in the computation of k h which employs a height of the centre of gravity over the keel of 9 743 m 5 results and discussion a comparison of the outputs of the simulations carried out with code aster and the marin experiments is presented next the modelling strategies are denoted as follows calhypso the rigid body hydromechanical simulation is carried out with the calhypso software where the mooring forces are calculated with the quasi static method code aster 1 the coupled dynamics of the system are calculated with the dynamic moorings model code aster 2a the platform motions are derived with calhypso as above and subsequently imposed to the dynamic moorings model motion driven simulation code aster 2b equivalent to code aster 2a neglecting the incident wave kinematics in the calculation of mooring drag forces for regular waves both the motion and the fairlead tension outputs are given in the response amplitude operator form rao using the maxima and minima of the steady state response signal whereas this is in principle a linear dynamic analysis procedure it is here extended to represent the range of oscillation of cyclical outputs in this context it should be noted that whilst motion signals closely follow sinusoidal waveforms mooring tensions exhibit significant distortion where irregular waves are concerned the power spectral density psd of the quantities of interest is presented this is calculated for a stationary regime of 2 h duration provided that the highest natural period of the structure that of surge motion is in the order of 100 s more than 50 resonant surge cycles are allowed considering this feature and that the input energy is located at smaller periods 2 h seem sufficient to capture the variability of the stochastic processes involved 5 1 regular waves fig 8 displays the platform s dynamic response under regular wave excitation found by the umaine marin campaign and through the simulations carried out with calhypso and the coupled dynamic model in plane motions surge heave pitch are the only rigid body dof excited as commonly found in slack moored offshore structures surge amplitude increases with the oscillation period similar response operators are found for the two different wave heights examined in this dof the outputs of calhypso and code aster are close to equivalent showing the limited effect of mooring dynamics on platform motion in this particular case with reference to the experiments both models tend to underestimate response slightly especially for t w 20 s where the error is in the order of 10 a similar accuracy has been obtained in the reference study by modelling these cases with nrel s fast coulling et al 2013 the normalised dynamic response in heave is limited to a fraction of a unit at low periods whilst at the near resonant period of t w 20 s it exceeds unit the heave dof is also well predicted by both numerical models which produce amplitude errors of a few percent points it is once again at 20 s that the models err the most showing however better performance than the fast results reported by coulling et al 2013 this may be explained by the explicit formulation of platform drag in the present models taking into account the wave kinematics this significantly contributes to exciting the structure vertically which does not happen in the referenced fast simulation where the drag model is only reactive said thesis is reinforced by the model to model comparison provided by masciola et al 2013 pitch appears to be a more problematic dof to be simulated in this case calhypso mostly underestimates pitch response across the studied range with an error pattern closely resembling that of the simulation outputs published by coulling et al 2013 in all cases but a and b the explicit inclusion of mooring dynamics enabled by code aster seems to positively affect the accuracy of the simulated platform response once again the system dynamics at the wave period of t w 20 s appear to be particularly sensitive to the modelling approach for pitch this is likely to be an effect of the proximity of the semi submersible platform s excitation suppression point which reduces the effect on response of the inertial wave excitation dominant elsewhere thereby exalting the importance of secondary hydrodynamic force systems the measured and predicted fairlead tensions in regular waves are shown in fig 9 a first and most striking if unsurprising observation is that the quasi static representation of calhypso severely underestimates the tension variance across the entire set of cases all dynamic mooring model outputs provide a more accurate estimate of the tension raos both for the upwave fairlead f1 and the downwave fairlead f2 and exceed the performance of the dynamic mooring simulations presented in masciola et al 2013 which underpredict the response amplitude the best performance is provided by the coupled dynamic simulation code aster 1 with the exception of downwave tension at 20 s d g which is better predicted by the motion driven approach accuracy seems to deteriorate for larger wave heights as observable from period matched case pairs such as b e the root cause may be sought in the extra tuning required by the chain drag coefficients governing the dynamic mooring effects at high energy which are currently static and calibrated at the full scale another possible cause may be the absence of potential 2nd order hydrodynamic excitation wave drift forces in the present numerical models the three dynamic modelling approaches presented exhibit good mutual agreement with the exception of the downwave line tension for t w 20 s in this case the coupled simulation provides a tension rao which is around 75 80 of the motion driven one possibly due to the differing pitch responses obtained by calhypso and code aster 1 as already seen in fig 8c further work will be required to clarify the system s dynamics at this particularly sensitive period the motion driven output tensions obtained by neglecting the incident wave kinematics are shown to slightly undershoot the standard motion driven results by up to 8 in the worst case this result is used to justify the use of approach code aster 2b in the following to simulate the mooring dynamics under irregular waves irregular wave kinematics are not implemented in code aster yet finally in terms of impact of modelling choices on mooring design it is worth noticing that for this particular floating system the quasi static approach severely underestimates tension ranges virtually in all wave conditions from low energy more frequent to high energy less frequent this underscores the need for dynamic mooring simulation for robust mooring line dimensioning for both fatigue and ultimate limit states 5 2 irregular waves calhypso is used here to compute the deepcwind fwt motion response under the irregular wave case defined in table 2 verifying the correct prediction of its dynamic response features is a required passage before tackling the analysis of the dynamic fairlead tensions obtained with code aster in order to facilitate the interpretation of the output spectra the uncoupled natural frequencies of the floater and of the undisturbed mooring lines are provided in table 7 the latter are calculated with the method described in wilson 2003 based on the transverse excitation modes of offshore mooring lines and disregarding the hydrodynamic added mass the psd of motion in the three excited dof is provided with fig 10 where the experimental results are available only for the translational dof the surge motion spectrum is bimodal with two distinct response peaks descending from the first order and second order drag hydrodynamic excitation on the platform both peaks exhibit good agreement with the measurements it is important to remark that satisfactory resonant response in surge is here obtained numerically without the inclusion of potential flow difference frequency forces as it was also observed during the valef2 project the representation of hull drag forces on a position updated basis introduces a low frequency forcing which can dominate the excitation of the surge mode depending on the type of structure studied in light of this the underprediction of resonant response in surge by the numerical model utilised in masciola et al 2013 may be due to the missing actualisation of the morison elements following the platform s displacements heave response in the wave frequency band is also well represented by the numerical model whilst the adjacent peak which identifies resonant motion excited by both inertial and viscous wave forces is slightly less well captured whilst the excess motion amplitude may be due to insufficient vertical dissipation in the model the slight natural frequency mismatch is likely due to the numerical added mass deficit on the platform s slender elements modelled with the morison approach using the motion time histories as input the motion driven simulation performed with the code aster 2b method provides the fairlead tension spectra displayed in fig 11 only the experimental spectrum of the upwave fairlead is available for comparison both spectra are trimodal with a low frequency peak governed by the resonant surge response of the platform a broader wave frequency peak and a high frequency tail the dynamically simulated spectrum matches the experimental observations net of the spectral noise caused at high frequency by the constant block averaging resolution chosen for the post processing mainly due to the angled geometry of the downwave mooring lines with respect to the in plane motion of the platform the dynamic component of the simulated tension is much lower than in the upwave line an important limitation of the present comparison consists in the random phases chosen to translate the input wave spectrum into a time domain signal a more rigorous numerical representation of the experiments could be carried out by matching the basin test phases unfortunately these are unknown whilst the first order dynamic response is unaffected by phasing response related to nonlinear processes combining different harmonics is linked to the specific phase set in the realisation see for instance roald et al 2013 due to missing information regarding the spectral realisation of the basin tests phases and duration of experiment the phasing issue is not addressed in the present study in terms of tension prediction the performance of the quasi static moorings model included in calhypso is satisfactory only at low frequency in the wave frequency band and above this model severely underestimates the tension range especially at the upwave fairlead this is an expected outcome of the use of the quasi static catenary representation of mooring forces in a highly dynamic simulation although the first natural mode of the mooring lines sits in the vicinity of the first order excitation peak a sensitivity analysis not included permitted to determine that drag rather then inertia is the dominant process causing tension magnification in this band which is not captured with the quasi static approach this is a known feature of catenary mooring systems in limited water depth both tension spectra obtained with code aster contain significant high frequency energy due to the mechanical nonlinearities of the mooring system and a possible excitation of the second transverse mode of the lines see table 7 this prediction is confirmed by the available experimental spectrum the broad frequency spreading of this response feature may be explained with the parametric line behaviour related to the low frequency variation of tension and suspended length caused by platform motion 6 conclusion and further work for the first time code aster the open source mechanical analysis software developed by edf r d has been used to simulate offshore mooring dynamics a successful application to the floating wind technology is included in the present work after the presentation of the methodological choices hinging on the 1d finite element representation of slender and compliant structures and unilateral contact it has been shown that appropriate model set up and initialisation permit to handle the hydromechanics of catenary moorings with this general purpose tool a range of dynamic simulations has been performed and compared with experimental results available in the literature the model has been shown to satisfactorily predict the coupled platform moorings dynamics of a fwt in regular waves in particular the dynamic fairlead tensions are well represented albeit with seemingly decreasing accuracy as the wave height is increased a motion driven simulation has also been carried out representing the system s dynamics under irregular waves and compared with experimental observations from the literature once again the fairlead tensions are correctly predicted by code aster the computational cost of the presented method is relatively moderate as a high energy 2 h sea state takes six to 7 h to run on a desktop machine it has been shown that all the constituents of dynamic tension response low frequency wave frequency and high frequency are captured by the numerical solution suggesting that the model correctly reproduces the main physical processes at play on the lines accuracy may be improved by further work for instance additional calibration efforts may be sought in the future perhaps by complementing the modelling workflow with reduced scale analyses a side observation can also be made based on the comparison of the experiments with the different numerical models employed nonlinear mooring line hydrodynamics drag govern the fairlead tension variance most dramatically so in high energy sea states in these conditions a quasi static model cannot even predict the correct order of magnitude of the tension oscillations as already pointed out in the past by authors e g hall and goupee 2015 dealing with the same case study unlike in conventional floating offshore applications dynamic or at least drag augmented quasi static mooring analysis seems to be strictly necessary to produce a reliable floating wind system design a more thorough verification of the capabilities of the code aster model will require the evaluation of the behaviour of different platform and mooring system combinations especially considering that the presented case uses a relatively large floater concept with a conventional slack mooring system considering the current trends in fwt technology priority may be placed on the implementation of fibre rope behaviour especially with respect to nonlinear stiffness characteristics and on the verification of taut tensioned system simulation the implementation of higher order wave forcing on the platform in the calculation chain should also permit to ascertain their influence on the system s dynamic response especially considering that the low frequency motions and tensions obtained here seem to match the experiments although no second order potential hydrodynamics are represented a further step may consist in dynamically linking the finite element solver to calhypso to enable fully coupled mechanical simulations in the future platform hydroelasticity may also be treated using this approach the inclusion of turbine loads already possible with the motion driven approach should be used for further investigations these will provide key insights on the frequency ranges excited in fully characterised operational states where turbine thrust drives platform offset and hence the peak mooring tensions also the cyclical loading from the turbine is expected to bear a minor impact on mooring line fatigue in its current form the presented code aster based dynamic moorings model has become part of edf r d offshore mechanics calculation chain and has already been used for concept verification and classification it has been employed by the utility to evaluate fwt mooring arrangements of different complexity in the context of the group s calls for tenders where solutions by modec ideol and other applicants were analysed and of joint industry project vertiwind further developments may be directed toward coefficient calibration a more detailed representation of the seabed interaction and of the fluid structure interaction and a generalisation of the types of mooring components tractable ropes buoys etc in particular finite elements of higher complexity beams may be used for the representation of less flexible 1d equipment such as umbilical cables provided that a reliable large displacement behaviour be implemented once the remaining building blocks of the presented aero hydro mooring model will be in place and validated standard mooring verification cycles may be run line tension maxima detected over the entire dlc set will be compared with the minimum breaking loads of the lines to verify the compliance of any configuration with the standards rainfall counting post treatment

23615,the design of reliable station keeping systems for permanent floating structures such as offshore renewable energy devices is vital to their lifelong integrity in highly dynamic and or deep water applications including hydrodynamics and structural dynamics in the mooring analysis is paramount for the accurate prediction of the loading on the lines and hence their dimensioning this article presents a new workflow based on edf r d s open source finite element analysis tool code aster enabling the dynamic analysis of catenary mooring systems with application to a floating wind turbine concept the university of maine deepcwind oc4 basin test campaign is used for validation showing that code aster can satisfactorily predict the fairlead tensions in both regular and irregular waves in the latter case all of the three main spectral components of tension observed in the experiments are found numerically also the dynamic line tension is systematically compared with that provided by the classic quasi static approach thereby confirming its limitations robust dynamic simulation of catenary moorings is shown to be possible using this generalist finite element software provided that the inputs be organised consistently with the physics of offshore hydromechanics keywords moorings dynamics finite element code aster floating wind oc4 1 introduction floating wind turbine fwt technology permits to access deep water offshore wind resources up to depths of a few hundred metres whilst it has already been demonstrated at the mw scale through a handful of prototypes its industrialisation is just beginning considerable challenges lie ahead due to the limited experience available in coupling a wind turbine generator to a floating structure producing cost effective integrated fwt designs will likely require a profound revision of engineering practices and quite possibly the adoption of radically innovative solutions before standardisation 1 1 mooring system the station keeping of a fwt is achieved by transferring the mean horizontal loads dominated by wind thrust to the seabed the mooring system defined as the ensemble of components involved in the load path from the fairleads to the soil must be designed to resist cyclical and extreme loads with adequate safety and if required redundancy for a general introduction to offshore mooring systems and their functions design and certification the reader may refer to chakrabarti 2005 offshore mooring systems commonly use the catenary principle fig 1 a to produce horizontal restoring forces exploiting the gravitational potential of heavy suspended lines on the contrary the restoring power of taut mooring arrangements fig 1b relies primarily on their elasticity in fwt applications the choice of mooring solution is primarily linked to water depth and floater technology and deeply impacts system design as well as marine operations and the risk structure of a project whilst the mw scale fwt prototypes installed to date hywind windfloat and the units installed off goto and fukushima employ slack chain moorings semi taut taut or tensioned arrangements are also considered for upcoming floating wind applications castro santos et al 2013 examples of taut mooring solutions using mainly fibre rope are found for instance within the early dcns sea reed design and the ideol floatgen demonstrator in these cases nylon has been favoured over other fibres in order to insure sufficiently soft behaviour in very shallow water 30 40 m where conventional arrangements become too stiff other configurations tailored for mid shallow waters have been studied such as catenary with clump weights e g vertiwind concept or the multi node gustomsc patented system de boom 2011 turbine weathervaning by mooring design may eliminate the need for an active nacelle yawing system and or attenuate loads on the floater for this sake single point fwt mooring systems have been devised using a turret e g eolink and saitec concepts or single anchor leg moorings finally tensioned systems have been investigated in order to reduce stability demand on the floater leading to the design of the sbm glosten pelastar and gicon tension leg platform systems as imaginable the properties of the mooring system define the dynamic response features of the whole system appropriately stiff or compliant behaviour in different degrees of freedom as well as the avoidance of resonance can be obtained by intervening on the mooring arrangement the design of a floating wind farm mooring system that is low maintenance sufficiently reliable and optimised for cost challenges the existing practices and holds large potential for improvement by r d considering that a permanent floating structure s very survivability depends on the integrity of its moorings a thorough understanding of their mechanical behaviour in the highly dynamic conditions found offshore is fundamental 1 2 numerical modelling of floating wind turbine moorings in the floating offshore structure industry both frequency and time domain numerical tools are used for the estimate of platform and mostly platform driven mooring response the less computationally intensive frequency domain methods treat wave frequency and low frequency wave loads and responses separately typically employing linear and quadratic wave force transfer functions qtf to define the excitation term of the platform s rigid body eom equations of motion this approach valid when non linearities other than those treated with qtf are modest is commonly applied to conventional offshore structures especially in early design stages and for large design load case dlc sets notably fatigue in floating wind the addition of wind and turbine related excitation at its own range of frequencies as well as the non linearities caused by the reduced size of structures calls for time domain solvers at earlier design stages in this case all physics can be treated at once in coupled fashion albeit at higher computational cost concerning the effect of the mooring system on platform motions in frequency versus time domain dynamic mooring model comparisons it is common to observe relative conservatism in frequency domain results due to absence of mooring damping cf for example stendal 2015 conversely mooring tensions may be underestimated by frequency domain solvers as they typically miss line bound inertial and hydrodynamic effects as discussed below after half a century of offshore engineering experience the role of dynamics in the mechanical behaviour of mooring systems is vastly documented it is commonly accepted that the quasi static representation of mooring lines becomes too inaccurate for the sake of engineering design when the motions of the structure are highly dynamic when drag intensive components are used for instance a mooring chain when water depth exceeds about 150 m or with any combination of the above matha et al 2011 in such cases the inertial hydrodynamic and seabed contact loads can govern the extreme and cyclical tension regimes on the lines dynamic effects can dominate the tension variance especially in domains where high energy and high compliance coexist this typically applies to conventional deep water offshore platforms mavrakos et al 1996 and to highly dynamic applications such as marine renewable energy installations johanning et al 2007 as a consequence the current state of the art time domain software for the design and analysis of offshore mooring systems e g orcaflex anysim flexcom fastlink 1 1 a simulator coupling nrel s code fast and orcaflex etc typically include dynamic simulation capabilities the above guidelines are readily transposed to the floating wind context and dictate the use of dynamic simulation tools especially when focussing on the mechanical response of the mooring system past research see for example karimirad 2013 has shown that the dynamic mooring effects tend to bear a limited impact on fwt motion due to the economical limitations to the practicable water depth presently a few hundred metres at the most yet even in these conditions the impact on platform motion may become observable in extreme sea states as pointed out by masciola et al 2013 increasing the water depth rapidly augments the sensitivity of platform motion to the mooring dynamics as reported by matha et al 2011 for instance a lumped mass model is used by lin 2015 to simulate the dynamics of a spar fwt with catenary chains for increasing water depths 320 600 and 900 m confirming the growing importance of dynamic line tension in determining the global response a different picture can be drawn for the dynamic effects on mooring line tension among others coulling et al 2013 and masciola et al 2013 demonstrate that the quasi static tensions severely underestimate experimental measurements even at the limited depth of 200 m and for operational met ocean conditions a recent review of the available dynamic mooring line theories is provided by masciola et al 2014 distinguishing three main categories lumped mass finite difference and finite element literature shows that both the popular finite element and lumped mass theories can provide accurate tension predictions although with more stringent resolution requirements by the latter approach lin 2015 masciola et al 2014 the finite element fe method has been chosen by numerous authors in the fwt modelling field a study by jeon et al 2013 evaluates the response of a spar type fwt using a catenary system evidencing the extensional vibrations of the mooring lines the dynamics of large multi turbine platforms are analysed by kallesoe et al 2011 and by kim et al 2015 incorporating a fe moorings model finite bar type elements are used in the coupled simulations of cheng et al 2015 to assess different vawt arrangements and by bachynski et al 2013 to determine the severity of transient fault related events on mooring tension coupled motion response and dynamic mooring tensions are obtained by zhang et al 2013 for a mw sized hawt on a small semi submersible platform also using the fe method the global effect of the hydrodynamic damping forces exerted on the mooring lines is characterised in the work of hall et al 2011 for a spar fwt using a nonlinear bar model a tension leg system is also studied with the fe approach by bae and kim 2013 allowing to bring out the effects of 2nd order sum frequency wave excitation on structural response the outputs of coupled simulation software using a range of different mooring theories are benchmarked in a report by jonkman et al 2010 a promising alternative for the representation of mooring dynamics is the multi body formulation as maintained by borg et al 2012 and muskulus 2011 which may enable a reduction of computational effort compared to fe resolutions for example matha et al 2011 use this modelling option to show the onset of hydrodynamic non linearities in the behaviour of a fwt due to mooring dynamics 1 3 code aster code aster is edf r d s all purpose open source fe solver for the thermo mechanical study of structures edf 2014 after over 20 years of development this software offers in the order of 400 finite element typologies for the discretisation of solids and a broad range of solvers all features which are thoroughly tested and validated it enables the static dynamic and vibrational analysis of mechanically loaded structures as well as modal analysis the current study looks to employ the nonlinear capabilities of this software to represent the dynamic behaviour of floating wind turbine mooring lines which are intrinsically characterised by nonlinear kinematics due to the presence of large displacements and intermittent seabed contact the features peculiar of mooring system modelling which are not readily available in the classic code aster workflow have been implemented by manually augmenting the command file with the necessary scripts and by developing practical methodologies based on appropriate sequences of simulations although code aster is written in french language the interested anglophone reader can acquire a grip on this software by consulting specialised wiki pages which provide examples and tutorials see for instance caelinux 2015 two related manuscripts have also been recently published which are rich in hands on examples thakore 2014a b the version of the software employed for this study is 12 2 10 development release 1 4 deepcwind oc4 experimental campaign an experimental campaign led by the university of maine was conducted at marin s wind and wave basin with the aim of calibrating and validating a coupled fwt dynamic simulator based on nrel s fast its outcomes are documented by published work by masciola et al 2013 and coulling et al 2013 where the outputs of different numerical implementations are compared to the measurements other authors have recently utilised this campaign for validation using both the fe koo et al 2014 and lumped mass hall and goupee 2015 simulation approaches the object of this campaign is a 1 50 th scale model of the deepcwind oc4 fwt fig 2 which consists in a scaled nrel 5 mw aerogenerator mounted on a three column semi submersible platform operating at an equivalent water depth of 200 m included in the physical model is a downscaled mooring system realised with a brass chain which closely resembles the full scale three leg arrangement specified in robertson et al 2014 load cells mounted at the fairleads provide the mooring tension signal the experiments carried out at the marin facility include free decay pull out wind only wave only and coupled wind wave tests the numerical model benchmarks clearly exhibit the limitations of the quasi static mooring model when it comes to assessing the dynamic tension ranges 1 5 selected validation data a subset of the experiments introduced in 1 4 is here used to validate the presented dynamic simulator published mooring tensions in coulling et al 2013 only treat purely hydrodynamic load cases with turbine parked and no wind for the sake of progressive model validation the same environmental conditions are applied in this work as a first step full environments including wind and turbine operational loads will be part of future work with verification possibly starting from a benchmark versus comparable tools such as nrel fast v8 using moordyn and validation from the comparison with further experimental outputs presented in goupee et al 2014 2 methodology the finite element method enables the spatial discretisation of a continuum reducing the degrees of freedom dof of a solid to a finite set which can be treated numerically a corresponding set of equations written with respect to the system s nodal dof is then used to seek the static or dynamic equilibrium configuration of the structure under any given combination of external loads and constraints 2 1 one dimensional discretisation the centrepiece of the proposed methodology is the homogeneous 1d finite element denoted cable available in code aster which was originally developed to simulate the mechanical behaviour of overhead electrical lines fléjou 2014 this two node element is a version of the classic bar element adapted to the large displacement context this makes it suitable for representing highly compliant mooring lines as discussed above bars are only one of many modelling possibilities a simpler and widespread option for dynamic mooring modelling is the lumped mass with spring and damper connections which requires higher mesh resolution whether this approach can be successfully implemented in code aster remains to be investigated on the opposite side the next fe type in terms of complexity is the beam large displacement beams are available in code aster which may be used to model mooring lines characterised by significant bending torsional or shear resistance but have been shown to be prone to error accumulation when undergoing repeated large rotations they also prove overcomplex when the mooring line s dominant mechanical resistance is axial a beneficial feature of bar elements with respect to beams is in fact the halving of the global dof at the nodes rotational dof are unassigned which preserves computational efficiency it should be noted that the absence of rotational reactions which characterises the cable is a reasonable modelling hypothesis only for line types which oppose negligible resistance to bending and torsion whilst this is generally accepted for chains orcina 2013 the behaviour of less flexible lines operating at low tension such as short and stiff rope segments may not be accurately represented under this assumption especially in the vicinity of rotational constraints focussing on bending and assuming a linear isotropic material and a constant line section the classic beam theory provides the governing parameter which if large enough causes elastic behaviour the segment s relative bending stiffness e i l this is defined by the material s young s modulus e the sectional bending inertia i and the characteristic length of the segment l in presence of a low homogeneous tension t this term may no longer be marginal with respect to the contribution of geometric bending stiffness which is proportional to t l and usually dominant in the reactive balance of a tensioned mooring line the underlying assumption of bending soft segments may be then written as e i l t l 2 1 1 finite element constitution a cable finite element is defined as a straight segment of length l with a constant cross section of area a the element s sections are supposed to be undeformable and to maintain a constant orientation in the local frame used in 3d space a cable disposes of six nodal dof in the global inertial system of reference which correspond to the nodal translations q e q n 1 q n 2 fig 3 linear shape functions l are used to express the internal displacement vector u in the global frame as a function of the normalised axial position on the element ξ s l as 1 u ξ l q e using 2 l 1 ξ 0 0 ξ 0 0 0 1 ξ 0 0 ξ 0 0 0 1 ξ 0 0 ξ the mechanical tensors describing a system of interconnected cables can be obtained by applying the lagrange equations and hence assembling the dof matched individual element contributions no basis changes are necessary thanks to the purely translational constitution of this element type which allows to write the kinematics directly in the common global frame 2 2 large displacements the presence of large displacements whether due to deformation or rigid body kinematics introduces a nonlinearity in solid mechanics causing the classic linearised methods to lose their ability to accurately describe the displaced configuration of the structure when the finite element method is used writing the rotation kinematics is also more complex because large rotations in 3d space cannot be represented with a vector they become in fact non commutative and must be treated with more complex methods such euler angles or quaternions de soza 2014 in the present model this only affects the support beam elements see 3 3 since the rotations of the cable elements take place implicitly following the nodal displacements code aster treats large displacements with the updated lagrangian method ul originally introduced by bathe and bolourchi 1979 which operates a reactualisation of the structure s geometry at every newton raphson iteration contrary to the classic static representation of matrices in linear solid mechanics the assembled system matrices are continuously recalculated an example application of the updated lagrangian method to a 1d element is next given with reference to fig 4 the structure s response is represented in the global inertial system of reference o xyz whilst the cable axial deformation takes place along s in the local frame ps we may define the initial undeformed state of the element with the numeral 0 identifying an initial frame p0s0 and an element length l 0 it is then assumed that a new equilibrium must be found for the next instant in time which is characterised by a different loading state let the configuration denoted with 1 be reached after a first newton raphson iteration takes place the new coordinate s 1 will then be associated to the internal strain of the element in the next iteration whilst the local deformation is reset to zero as the new configuration with length l 1 becomes the reference geometry the new reference stress state must naturally be nonzero to account for past strain in the definition of the element s geometric stiffness de soza 2014 the following newton raphson iteration is carried out by recalculating the system tangent matrix in the new configuration leading to the next displacement guess at 2 the procedure is repeated until convergence is achieved within the time step 2 3 seabed contact the interaction of a mooring line with the seabed is a complex subject which interfaces structural and geotechnical engineering the state of the art seabed theory proposes a combination of two non linear dissipative phenomena for the representation of the reactive soil forces lateral friction and uplift repenetration resistance orcina 2013 a model of this type is expected to provide a representation of seabed interaction which is accurate enough for the assessment of the fatigue life of mooring segments located around the touchdown point according to randolph and quiggin 2009 in the present study a smooth and rigid seabed model is used instead which reduces contact to a reversible conservative phenomenon among the contact modelling options available in code aster this is the simplest and most robust the introduction of dissipative contact is possible in code aster and may be sought by further work this will likely require the creation of shell elements to represent the seabed and the assignment of a master slave hierarchy between the mooring line elements and said shells see the relevant documentation by de soza 2015 under the current hypotheses the two variables governing surface contact are d the clearance between the structure e g a node and the contact surface and σ the normal contact stress the hertz signorini moreau contact conditions are introduced see for example yastrebov 2011 impenetrability kinematic condition d 0 non negative contact stress dynamic cond σ 0 complementarity energetic condition d σ 0 the resulting unilateral contact law is then expressed as 3 d 0 σ 0 d σ 0 which is satisfied in the domain visualised in fig 5 the positive semi definite d σ relationship found is non univocal and is not differentiable in d σ 0 these features make it a non trivial numerical implementation unilateral contact is introduced in the model as a constrained optimisation problem using karush kuhn tucker kkt conditions weisstein 2015 which are in practice applied to an arbitrary set of nodal dof abbas 2015 on the user side the unilateral boundary condition is imposed by applying an analytically defined inequality to the nodal displacements when touch down contact over a flat seabed located at z h is considered this assumes the form 4 δ z h z 0 in the above expression δ z denotes the cumulated vertical displacement of a node over the simulation and z 0 its initial vertical coordinate 2 4 mooring line hydrodynamics the morison approach is employed in the form detailed next to compute the hydrodynamic forces on the lines by taking into account both the structure s motion and the wave kinematics first a simplification is made by disregarding the inertial wave forces due to the small diameter of the mooring lines compared to the length of ocean waves these are negligible with respect to viscous forces the same modelling hypothesis is used by commercial mooring simulation software such as anysim marin 2011 the morison equation term associated to the fluid s added mass force is accounted for in reactive form with the procedure outlined in 2 4 2 and removed from the external loads this leaves only drag in the morison equation which is computed as follows the mooring line is assimilated to a circular cylinder of equivalent volume whose diameter is d the mooring line s volumetric diameter an arbitrarily oriented orthonormal frame p x y z with x s is assigned for the decomposition of velocity unit vectors i j and k define the directions of axes x y and z in the global frame respectively following from 2 1 1 let u denote the instantaneous position of a section and v the absolute flow velocity at the section s location in the fluid the relative flow velocity is defined by w v u subsequently the axial and normal components of vector w are with respect to the element s frame 5 w x w i w y w j w z w k this enables the decomposition of the drag problem of a porous 1d body in 3d space such as a mooring chain the axial drag force per unit length is written as 6 d f x d l 1 2 ρ w c d a d w x w x the transverse component of the relative velocity defined with 7 w n w w x i enters the computation of the normal drag force 8 d f y d l 1 2 ρ w c d n d w n w y d f z d l 1 2 ρ w c d n d w n w z note that the axial declination of this formula uses the same reference diameter as the normal one this is customary in mooring analysis and requires a consistent choice of c d a and c d n equations 6 and 8 can also be written equivalently with reference to the nominal line diameter which corresponds to the bar diameter for a mooring chain 2 4 1 viscous forces equations 6 and 8 represent the viscous drag forces which dominate wave structure interaction for slender bodies such as mooring lines and enter the global eom as a time and displacement dependent excitation term normal and axial drag forces are treated as distributed loads and their integral over the length of each element is approximated using the gauss method using n gauss points enables to compute force distributions up to the 2 n 1 th order in the present application n 3 is used which should suffice to capture correctly the drag force variability over mooring segments of limited length in order to do this the local speed u is calculated at each of the gauss points by interpolation between the extremity nodes whilst v is obtained using the incident wave particle kinematics providing the local drag force per unit length the integration of the approximating polynomial times the element shape function finally yields the equivalent nodal forces which enter the dynamic equilibrium equation after being reexpressed in the global system of reference 2 4 2 inertial forces the inertial fluid reactions may play a significant role in determining a line s dynamic response since they contribute to the effective modal mass for a standard steel chain for example added mass represents about a tenth of the normal modal mass this is why the reactive part of the inertial hydrodynamic force is considered here by means of a left hand side lhs added mass force based on the methods commonly employed by industrial software e g marin 2011 orcina 2013 the axial flow and normal flow added masses of a slender mooring segment are respectively expressed with 9 m a a c a a ρ w m a n c a n ρ w this formula employs the volumetric acception of the added mass coefficient c a the other defining parameters are water density ρ w and the segment volume as it will be shown in 3 1 the hydrodynamic added mass is here summed to the mechanical mass of the cables by an increase of material density this corresponds to assuming m a a m a n m a which in principle is incorrect for example for mooring chains a reasonable normal to tangential added mass ratio is in the order of 3 see marin 2011 fortunately far from the fairlead excitation the dynamic displacements of pre tensioned mooring chain segments take place mostly in the transverse direction reflecting the low modes of a slender and axially stiff structure it is therefore reasonable to calibrate c a on the normal added mass at the expense of the representation of axial fluid reaction 3 model set up next are presented the user side procedures which enable to carry out mooring simulations with code aster these start with the selection of an appropriate combination of physical parameters for the simultaneous representation of gravitational buoyancy structural inertial and hydrodynamic added mass forces on the lines then the catenary laying procedure is explained which initialises the mooring simulation the representation of the floating platform with its rigid body dynamics is also briefly outlined finally an account is made of the selection of the time integration scheme 3 1 chain equivalent element in this type of model mooring chains need to be assimilated to homogeneous 1d elements their complex geometry and the presence of articulated joints fig 6 translate in large longitudinal variations of the mechanical properties at the link scale in order to correctly represent a mooring chain segment with a bar type element these attributes must be expressed in longitudinally averaged form a homogeneous cable element is defined by the material specific quantities e c and e c the young s moduli associated to tension and compression and the volumetric mass ρ c the following geometrical quantities also concur in defining the element a c the element s sectional area and l c its span among these parameters e c is set to zero for a chain see orcina 2013 whilst l c is dictated by the input mesh for each element to determine the remaining parameters the modeller must pay attention to the following aspects axial stiffness the nominal axial stiffness found in the chain specifications κ must be respected by the equivalent cable element that is κ c e c a c κ inertial mass per unit length another catalogue parameter is ϱ the chain s average mass per unit length in order to assign the correct mass to the equivalent cable for the computation of inertial forces one must satisfy ρ m a c ϱ with ρ m denoting the chain material s density the above relations combined identify the equivalent cable s sectional area and young s modulus as 10 a c ϱ ρ m e c κ a c κ ρ m ϱ note that the quantities found with equation 10 must be distinguished from the physical chain s geometric and material properties since in the present implementation the reactive added mass force is approximated with an isotropic increase of inertial mass see 2 4 an according correction on material density is introduced let ρ w be the water density and c a the volumetric added mass coefficient the input equivalent cable density becomes 11 ρ c ρ m c a ρ w the corrected gravitational acceleration to be applied on the lines in the numerical simulation is obtained with 12 g c g 1 c a 1 c a ρ m ρ w as demonstrated by antonutti 2015 which insures the representation of the correct weight force per unit length inclusive of the buoyancy force 3 2 catenary laying finding the static equilibrium configuration of highly flexible structures such as offshore moorings is a known numerical challenge in finite element analysis see for instance webster 1980 if one excludes the pre generation of the equilibrium geometry using catenary formulae the above translates into finding a gravitationally loaded static equilibrium configuration with code aster which is far removed from an arbitrarily chosen initial geometry the strategy proposed here to solve this problem and initialise the mooring simulation is described next for a single mooring line let f and a be the fairlead and anchor point whose location in space is known assuming l the unstretched mooring line length as input a convenient starting geometry is obtained by breaking the mooring line into two straight segments 2 2 defining the initial mooring line geometry as a set of straight lines in space is functional to both mesh generation and the imposition of the unilateral contact laws of 2 3 in analytical form ak and kf lying in the vertical plane which contains a and f with 13 ak kf l this defines the initial configuration ω i shown in fig 7 the target static equilibrium configuration ω s also appears in the figure from the starting state ω i the quasi static solver available in code aster cannot approach ω s through a sequence of quasi static solutions with increasing excitation since the equilibrium geometry neglecting elastic deformation is the same for any magnitude of the gravitational forcing in the case of catenary laying the system must find the equilibrium state mostly by rigid body displacement unfortunately quasi free rigid body motion is characterised by a singular tangent stiffness matrix which makes the problem untractable with the quasi static solver in such cases using the dynamic solver permits to reestablish the equilibrium between internal and external forces thanks to the contribution of inertia and damping to the tangent matrix introducing inertia alone stabilises the calculation but cannot provide the motion decay required to attain ω s a source of dissipation is needed to remove the potential energy differential between ω i and ω s from the system this is achieved with the introduction of a controlled amount of rayleigh damping after imposing the gravitational load clump boundary conditions in f and a and the seabed contact condition a decaying dynamic simulation with near critical damping may be obtained such a simulation generally leads to a satisfactory approximation of ω s in a few tens of seconds simulation time at the end a one step static simulation is run using ω s as input in order to eliminate any spurious dynamic effect its output ω 0 ω t 0 is used to initialise the subsequent simulations of physical interest 3 3 floating platform geometry and dynamics studying the mechanics of a complete fwt mooring system requires to link the fairlead points to simulate the presence of the floater a rigid platform model is presently utilised for this sake which consists in a set of massless undeformable beam elements see fléjou 2015 for a description of beam elements in code aster each connecting a fairlead to the platform pivoting point first a motion driven approach is proposed the platform hydromechanics are solved with edf r d s time domain simulator calhypso see antonutti et al 2016 for a description of this software which provides the six dof motion response signals these are applied within code aster as a time dependent boundary condition located on the platform reference node in this case the feedback loop between platform dynamics and the dynamic component of the mooring system s response is not represented see for instance ormberg and larsen 1998 in qualitative terms the severity of this limitation is proportional to the relative size of the mooring system with respect to the floater which is governed by water depth dnv 2013b lin 2015 the dynamically uncoupled approach used in this study seeks to contain the retroaction inaccuracy through the use of a quasi static nonlinear mooring model in calhypso but cannot include any dynamic mooring retroactions such as additional dampening of platform motions if the platform dynamics are not imposed and need instead to resolved independently by code aster in a coupled simulation a rigid hydromechanical floating structure model is introduced in the fe environment this is done by lumping the aggregate structure mass and hydrostatic stiffness tensors defined at the floating structure s equilibrium m and k h onto a 6 dof punctual 0d element see fléjou 2013 where the incident wave excitation f t is also applied only harmonic regular wave simulations can be organised with this method since the convolution treatment of aharmonic wave radiation forces is unavailable by assuming that motion is monochromatic and that its frequency equals that of the incident wave ω these forces may be represented in the lhs by assigning frequency independent linear added mass and damping tensors to the above defined 0d element a ω and b ω based on the outputs of the frequency domain radiation calculation 3 3 for both calhypso and code aster the frequency domain hydrodynamic data base formed by f ω arg f ω a ω and b ω is obtained upfront using nemoh of the ecole centrale de nantes see babarit and delhommeau 2015 which solves the linear wave diffraction and radiation problems via the panel method finally the hull drag forces are imposed on the structure using an extra set of rigidly connected massless beams and the method of 2 4 1 please refer to section 5 for a definition of the labels used for the different dynamic approaches in the following 3 4 numerical damping dynamic mooring analyses aim to precisely represent low frequencies wave excitation and mooring line modes and tend to be affected by parasitic high frequency oscillations caused by the system non linearities this is a common problem in structural mechanics often addressed via controlled numerical damping in particular hilber et al 1977 proposed a dissipative time integration scheme of the newmark family commonly referred to as hht which introduces low numerical damping in the low frequency band and high damping at high frequency thereby allowing to stabilise the simulation for the above reasons the hht integration scheme is recommended for the dynamic treatment of cable elements in code aster especially in the presence of contact shocks fléjou 2014 greffet 2011 in the applications presented in section 5 a viable value of the numerical damping parameter was chosen by gradually increasing its magnitude until the fairlead tension the reference output signal became free of high frequency noise 4 validation cases static validation cases for the presented code aster workflow are provided by antonutti 2015 next the focus will be placed on dynamic mooring simulation with reference to the deepcwind oc4 basin tests among the variety of loading cases presented in masciola et al 2013 it is here chosen to model the subset for which the authors provide experimental fairlead tension data this corresponds to six regular wave scenarios here denoted with letters b to g plus an irregular wave case another low energy regular wave scenario a is reproduced from coulling et al 2013 in these tests wavetrains of varying properties are sent over the structure in the negative x direction consistently with fig 2 this campaign is focussed on highly energetic sea states representing extreme oceanic conditions which should help bring out the dynamic features of the mooring system tables 1 and 2 define the loading cases considered using full scale dimensions the regular waves used to excite the structure are moderately steep causing them to fall into the 2nd order stokes field of the classic wave theory classification see le méhauté 1976 a relatively low peak enhancement factor equalling 2 2 is used in the irregular wave case following the experiments carried out at marin note that the intensity of the highest wave conditions considered reaches levels which are typical of 50 year return period oceanic conditions which are used as the minimum ultimate limit state reference by mainstream floating wind standards by abs 2013 bv 2015 and dnv 2013a 4 1 numerical model parameters the reference study compares experimental and numerical outputs at the full scale which is also adopted here the geometric parameters of the oc4 floater see fig 2 are given in table 3 the aggregated mass and inertia properties of the floating system are provided in table 4 since all the considered loading cases feature a parked turbine which intervenes in the model as a rigid onboard mass it is not necessary to reproduce the wind turbine particulars in greater detail the mooring system geometry is identical to that presented for the full scale deepcwind turbine in robertson et al 2014 designed for a water depth of 200 m and readily described with the parameters of table 5 the physical model s mooring chain properties brought to full scale are provided with table 6 the reported drag coefficients are assigned based on the values proposed by marin 2011 for standard full scale chains whilst the volumetric added mass coefficient is set to unit consistently with masciola et al 2013 the gravitational equilibrium requirement is satisfied by countering the undisturbed mooring line weight with an equal vertical force applied at each fairlead this reintroduces the need to represent the stabilising effect of the mooring system weight with a corresponding gravitational correction in the computation of k h which employs a height of the centre of gravity over the keel of 9 743 m 5 results and discussion a comparison of the outputs of the simulations carried out with code aster and the marin experiments is presented next the modelling strategies are denoted as follows calhypso the rigid body hydromechanical simulation is carried out with the calhypso software where the mooring forces are calculated with the quasi static method code aster 1 the coupled dynamics of the system are calculated with the dynamic moorings model code aster 2a the platform motions are derived with calhypso as above and subsequently imposed to the dynamic moorings model motion driven simulation code aster 2b equivalent to code aster 2a neglecting the incident wave kinematics in the calculation of mooring drag forces for regular waves both the motion and the fairlead tension outputs are given in the response amplitude operator form rao using the maxima and minima of the steady state response signal whereas this is in principle a linear dynamic analysis procedure it is here extended to represent the range of oscillation of cyclical outputs in this context it should be noted that whilst motion signals closely follow sinusoidal waveforms mooring tensions exhibit significant distortion where irregular waves are concerned the power spectral density psd of the quantities of interest is presented this is calculated for a stationary regime of 2 h duration provided that the highest natural period of the structure that of surge motion is in the order of 100 s more than 50 resonant surge cycles are allowed considering this feature and that the input energy is located at smaller periods 2 h seem sufficient to capture the variability of the stochastic processes involved 5 1 regular waves fig 8 displays the platform s dynamic response under regular wave excitation found by the umaine marin campaign and through the simulations carried out with calhypso and the coupled dynamic model in plane motions surge heave pitch are the only rigid body dof excited as commonly found in slack moored offshore structures surge amplitude increases with the oscillation period similar response operators are found for the two different wave heights examined in this dof the outputs of calhypso and code aster are close to equivalent showing the limited effect of mooring dynamics on platform motion in this particular case with reference to the experiments both models tend to underestimate response slightly especially for t w 20 s where the error is in the order of 10 a similar accuracy has been obtained in the reference study by modelling these cases with nrel s fast coulling et al 2013 the normalised dynamic response in heave is limited to a fraction of a unit at low periods whilst at the near resonant period of t w 20 s it exceeds unit the heave dof is also well predicted by both numerical models which produce amplitude errors of a few percent points it is once again at 20 s that the models err the most showing however better performance than the fast results reported by coulling et al 2013 this may be explained by the explicit formulation of platform drag in the present models taking into account the wave kinematics this significantly contributes to exciting the structure vertically which does not happen in the referenced fast simulation where the drag model is only reactive said thesis is reinforced by the model to model comparison provided by masciola et al 2013 pitch appears to be a more problematic dof to be simulated in this case calhypso mostly underestimates pitch response across the studied range with an error pattern closely resembling that of the simulation outputs published by coulling et al 2013 in all cases but a and b the explicit inclusion of mooring dynamics enabled by code aster seems to positively affect the accuracy of the simulated platform response once again the system dynamics at the wave period of t w 20 s appear to be particularly sensitive to the modelling approach for pitch this is likely to be an effect of the proximity of the semi submersible platform s excitation suppression point which reduces the effect on response of the inertial wave excitation dominant elsewhere thereby exalting the importance of secondary hydrodynamic force systems the measured and predicted fairlead tensions in regular waves are shown in fig 9 a first and most striking if unsurprising observation is that the quasi static representation of calhypso severely underestimates the tension variance across the entire set of cases all dynamic mooring model outputs provide a more accurate estimate of the tension raos both for the upwave fairlead f1 and the downwave fairlead f2 and exceed the performance of the dynamic mooring simulations presented in masciola et al 2013 which underpredict the response amplitude the best performance is provided by the coupled dynamic simulation code aster 1 with the exception of downwave tension at 20 s d g which is better predicted by the motion driven approach accuracy seems to deteriorate for larger wave heights as observable from period matched case pairs such as b e the root cause may be sought in the extra tuning required by the chain drag coefficients governing the dynamic mooring effects at high energy which are currently static and calibrated at the full scale another possible cause may be the absence of potential 2nd order hydrodynamic excitation wave drift forces in the present numerical models the three dynamic modelling approaches presented exhibit good mutual agreement with the exception of the downwave line tension for t w 20 s in this case the coupled simulation provides a tension rao which is around 75 80 of the motion driven one possibly due to the differing pitch responses obtained by calhypso and code aster 1 as already seen in fig 8c further work will be required to clarify the system s dynamics at this particularly sensitive period the motion driven output tensions obtained by neglecting the incident wave kinematics are shown to slightly undershoot the standard motion driven results by up to 8 in the worst case this result is used to justify the use of approach code aster 2b in the following to simulate the mooring dynamics under irregular waves irregular wave kinematics are not implemented in code aster yet finally in terms of impact of modelling choices on mooring design it is worth noticing that for this particular floating system the quasi static approach severely underestimates tension ranges virtually in all wave conditions from low energy more frequent to high energy less frequent this underscores the need for dynamic mooring simulation for robust mooring line dimensioning for both fatigue and ultimate limit states 5 2 irregular waves calhypso is used here to compute the deepcwind fwt motion response under the irregular wave case defined in table 2 verifying the correct prediction of its dynamic response features is a required passage before tackling the analysis of the dynamic fairlead tensions obtained with code aster in order to facilitate the interpretation of the output spectra the uncoupled natural frequencies of the floater and of the undisturbed mooring lines are provided in table 7 the latter are calculated with the method described in wilson 2003 based on the transverse excitation modes of offshore mooring lines and disregarding the hydrodynamic added mass the psd of motion in the three excited dof is provided with fig 10 where the experimental results are available only for the translational dof the surge motion spectrum is bimodal with two distinct response peaks descending from the first order and second order drag hydrodynamic excitation on the platform both peaks exhibit good agreement with the measurements it is important to remark that satisfactory resonant response in surge is here obtained numerically without the inclusion of potential flow difference frequency forces as it was also observed during the valef2 project the representation of hull drag forces on a position updated basis introduces a low frequency forcing which can dominate the excitation of the surge mode depending on the type of structure studied in light of this the underprediction of resonant response in surge by the numerical model utilised in masciola et al 2013 may be due to the missing actualisation of the morison elements following the platform s displacements heave response in the wave frequency band is also well represented by the numerical model whilst the adjacent peak which identifies resonant motion excited by both inertial and viscous wave forces is slightly less well captured whilst the excess motion amplitude may be due to insufficient vertical dissipation in the model the slight natural frequency mismatch is likely due to the numerical added mass deficit on the platform s slender elements modelled with the morison approach using the motion time histories as input the motion driven simulation performed with the code aster 2b method provides the fairlead tension spectra displayed in fig 11 only the experimental spectrum of the upwave fairlead is available for comparison both spectra are trimodal with a low frequency peak governed by the resonant surge response of the platform a broader wave frequency peak and a high frequency tail the dynamically simulated spectrum matches the experimental observations net of the spectral noise caused at high frequency by the constant block averaging resolution chosen for the post processing mainly due to the angled geometry of the downwave mooring lines with respect to the in plane motion of the platform the dynamic component of the simulated tension is much lower than in the upwave line an important limitation of the present comparison consists in the random phases chosen to translate the input wave spectrum into a time domain signal a more rigorous numerical representation of the experiments could be carried out by matching the basin test phases unfortunately these are unknown whilst the first order dynamic response is unaffected by phasing response related to nonlinear processes combining different harmonics is linked to the specific phase set in the realisation see for instance roald et al 2013 due to missing information regarding the spectral realisation of the basin tests phases and duration of experiment the phasing issue is not addressed in the present study in terms of tension prediction the performance of the quasi static moorings model included in calhypso is satisfactory only at low frequency in the wave frequency band and above this model severely underestimates the tension range especially at the upwave fairlead this is an expected outcome of the use of the quasi static catenary representation of mooring forces in a highly dynamic simulation although the first natural mode of the mooring lines sits in the vicinity of the first order excitation peak a sensitivity analysis not included permitted to determine that drag rather then inertia is the dominant process causing tension magnification in this band which is not captured with the quasi static approach this is a known feature of catenary mooring systems in limited water depth both tension spectra obtained with code aster contain significant high frequency energy due to the mechanical nonlinearities of the mooring system and a possible excitation of the second transverse mode of the lines see table 7 this prediction is confirmed by the available experimental spectrum the broad frequency spreading of this response feature may be explained with the parametric line behaviour related to the low frequency variation of tension and suspended length caused by platform motion 6 conclusion and further work for the first time code aster the open source mechanical analysis software developed by edf r d has been used to simulate offshore mooring dynamics a successful application to the floating wind technology is included in the present work after the presentation of the methodological choices hinging on the 1d finite element representation of slender and compliant structures and unilateral contact it has been shown that appropriate model set up and initialisation permit to handle the hydromechanics of catenary moorings with this general purpose tool a range of dynamic simulations has been performed and compared with experimental results available in the literature the model has been shown to satisfactorily predict the coupled platform moorings dynamics of a fwt in regular waves in particular the dynamic fairlead tensions are well represented albeit with seemingly decreasing accuracy as the wave height is increased a motion driven simulation has also been carried out representing the system s dynamics under irregular waves and compared with experimental observations from the literature once again the fairlead tensions are correctly predicted by code aster the computational cost of the presented method is relatively moderate as a high energy 2 h sea state takes six to 7 h to run on a desktop machine it has been shown that all the constituents of dynamic tension response low frequency wave frequency and high frequency are captured by the numerical solution suggesting that the model correctly reproduces the main physical processes at play on the lines accuracy may be improved by further work for instance additional calibration efforts may be sought in the future perhaps by complementing the modelling workflow with reduced scale analyses a side observation can also be made based on the comparison of the experiments with the different numerical models employed nonlinear mooring line hydrodynamics drag govern the fairlead tension variance most dramatically so in high energy sea states in these conditions a quasi static model cannot even predict the correct order of magnitude of the tension oscillations as already pointed out in the past by authors e g hall and goupee 2015 dealing with the same case study unlike in conventional floating offshore applications dynamic or at least drag augmented quasi static mooring analysis seems to be strictly necessary to produce a reliable floating wind system design a more thorough verification of the capabilities of the code aster model will require the evaluation of the behaviour of different platform and mooring system combinations especially considering that the presented case uses a relatively large floater concept with a conventional slack mooring system considering the current trends in fwt technology priority may be placed on the implementation of fibre rope behaviour especially with respect to nonlinear stiffness characteristics and on the verification of taut tensioned system simulation the implementation of higher order wave forcing on the platform in the calculation chain should also permit to ascertain their influence on the system s dynamic response especially considering that the low frequency motions and tensions obtained here seem to match the experiments although no second order potential hydrodynamics are represented a further step may consist in dynamically linking the finite element solver to calhypso to enable fully coupled mechanical simulations in the future platform hydroelasticity may also be treated using this approach the inclusion of turbine loads already possible with the motion driven approach should be used for further investigations these will provide key insights on the frequency ranges excited in fully characterised operational states where turbine thrust drives platform offset and hence the peak mooring tensions also the cyclical loading from the turbine is expected to bear a minor impact on mooring line fatigue in its current form the presented code aster based dynamic moorings model has become part of edf r d offshore mechanics calculation chain and has already been used for concept verification and classification it has been employed by the utility to evaluate fwt mooring arrangements of different complexity in the context of the group s calls for tenders where solutions by modec ideol and other applicants were analysed and of joint industry project vertiwind further developments may be directed toward coefficient calibration a more detailed representation of the seabed interaction and of the fluid structure interaction and a generalisation of the types of mooring components tractable ropes buoys etc in particular finite elements of higher complexity beams may be used for the representation of less flexible 1d equipment such as umbilical cables provided that a reliable large displacement behaviour be implemented once the remaining building blocks of the presented aero hydro mooring model will be in place and validated standard mooring verification cycles may be run line tension maxima detected over the entire dlc set will be compared with the minimum breaking loads of the lines to verify the compliance of any configuration with the standards rainfall counting post treatment

23616,to avoid safety issues current marine operations safety protocols follow only the work procedures and technical structures of systems that are provided by the operator regardless research continues to report safety issues related to cooperative work within marine operational systems thus we use the concept of boundary object to analyze excerpts from a series of field notes and to discuss holistic human safety we illustrate that human safety is only supported at the individual level of engineering community practices but does not address safety at a cooperative level between marine operations and other operations at the individual level human safety issues can be related to technical errors and failures in interaction and communication this paper presents suggestions on how to make the work practices of marine engineers and marine operators visible within design processes enabling them to collaborate with engineering designers and human factors engineers in the design of marine operations safety keywords holistic human safety marine operations safety standard cooperative work environment 1 introduction in the maritime domain research that focuses on the improvement of human safety is typically conducted by engineering designers these designers use a systematic design approach pahl et al 2007 to analyze and identify work situations from product and system design features this approach includes a set of theories and methods that can identify essential problems establish the functional structure of systems search for solution principles and combine them sadeghi et al 2016 marine engineers engineering designers and human factors engineers believe that human safety is consequently affected by technical systems kleiner et al 2015 from this perspective risks to human safety can be avoided through enhanced technologies and by training operators to follow appropriate work procedures for operations and the technical structures of systems as an example most marine engineers understand that human safety is impacted by marine operations safety can therefore be ensured by designing work procedures that adhere to national and international regulations det norske maskinistforbund 2013 marine engineers approach human safety by considering how to make work procedures suitable to every unique marine operation that marine operators encounter because it is an attribute that exists within technologies engineering designers can secure human safety with advanced technologies sadeghi et al 2015 therefore human safety can be measured through appropriate experimentation by human factors engineers lützhöft 2004 human factors engineers believe that human safety risks can be avoided by iterating upon enhanced technologies during design processes and by evaluating the interactions between the operators and interfaces of those technologies thus studies in maritime research have followed these approaches during attempts to solve human safety issues amongst marine operators and marine operational systems within cooperative work environments these studies have used a variety of methods such as marine operational systems to enable cooperative work which have been developed with collective and individual computer systems alike park et al 2004 however existing literature aas 2010 has continued to report human error as a causal or contributing factor in 60 90 of all accidents baker and mccafferty 2005 of these approximately 50 of maritime accidents have been the result of human errors that existed outside of the context of technical systems in addition baker and mccafferty 2005 revealed that 30 of marine safety incidents resulted from human failure to avoid accidents during cooperative work the nature of human safety in marine operations safety is complex kongsberg 2016 marine operations are highly cooperative and require multiple marine operators to use marine operational systems within cooperative and socio technical environments hepsø 1997 when marine operators use marine operational systems human safety issues do not always arise at the individual level rather these issues can emerge from cooperative work that takes place between marine operators and marine operational systems forskningsrådet 2012 in design research researchers have argued that when cooperative work is considered to be a part of the social fabric of design it is often overlooked during the design of cooperative operations technology manzini 2015 as such we believe that understanding safety in the context of individual engineering work like the design of safety features for an engineering system to support holistic human safety within cooperative operations can lead to inadequate engineering work in the maritime domain although many researchers have called for holistic engineering work practices to support in situ work and socio technical innovations few studies have focused on methods that can merge social and technological characteristics in order to solve engineering problems for example petersen and buch 2016 explored how the user experience approach synthesized engineering practices at a car manufacturer by enabling certain engineering methodologies to work across various engineering organizations however their study failed to explain how users could participate in engineering work to make their efforts visible rather petersen and buch focused primarily on engineers who estimated car buyer s purchasing requirements so that they could restructure engineering organizations by contrast we argue that in current marine operational systems the in situ work practices of marine operators and marine engineers are largely invisible because they are typically unobserved star and strauss 1999 in order to improve and extend marine operational systems and to address the ecology of marine operations safety we intend to make this work visible to gain this new understanding of human safety in engineering work we use the concept of boundary object which according to star and griesemer 1989 is robust enough to allow researchers of design research to collaborate with other engineering practices and to analyze and investigate human safety as a boundary object human safety requires marine operators marine engineers design researchers and engineering designers to address the safety operations of every stage of marine operation this can enable engineering designers and design researchers to shape marine operational systems within the context of marine operators and their cooperative work in addition if we treat human safety as a robust feature that permits marine engineers design engineers and human factors engineers to practice marine technology at the individual level of their different communities human safety can be supported through the use of enhanced technical systems backalov et al 2016a b and institutional work procedures in addition if human safety can be made flexible it can be supported by enriching the social meaning of engineering practices from a holistic human safety perspective within cooperative work environments which can in turn allow marine operators to vocalize their opinions about the in situ cooperative work practices of marine operations to marine engineers and increase their ability to perform efficient work procedures this paper s definition of holistic human safety therefore refers to good cooperation amongst various engineering communities during the design of marine operations safety protocols that support cooperative marine operators the paper s research questions include the following what type of marine operational systems can provide holistic support to human safety what methods can be used to design these systems and the involvement of what types of knowledge from the different engineering communities marine engineering design research engineering design and human factors engineering can be used to support marine operations safety in addition the paper will be structured as follows section 2 will discuss the definition of the word safety and the current understanding of human safety within the maritime domain section 3 will introduce the empirical setting section 4 will present the data collection and methods that are used in this paper and section 5 will use a boundary object to illustrate how marine operational systems and human safety are built within field studies in order to make the work involved in marine operations visible during the design of marine operations safety the paper will also review the processes that demand cooperation between design researchers and design maritime and human factors engineers using analyses of earlier field work that was conducted at sea this paper will argue for the importance of integrating the work of marine operators and marine engineers into common engineering practices such as designing operational systems and ensuring ecology within marine operations safety finally section 7 will explore methods that can enrich engineering work so that it can support a variety of marine operations the paper will then conclude that designers and engineers will need to use the outcomes of field work to drive bottom up socio technical innovations that can force the evolution of both social and technical practices and support human safety in cooperative work environments such as marine operations 2 what is safety and human safety in the maritime domain despite the common interest in safety and human safety in the maritime domain definitions for both remain insufficient it should therefore be made clear that this paper s position on human safety is different than most engineering studies by comparing with safety and human safety in the maritime domain according to the national aeronautics and space administration nasa 2008 safety focuses exclusively on physical rather than functional consequences in terms of product safety a product is considered to be safe when it does not result in death injury occupational illness damage to the environment and damage to or loss of equipment or property by comparison research related to marine engineering engineering design and human factors engineering considers human safety to be a part of the machinery safety process khan et al 2015 wherein machinery control systems are modeled to guard against predictable safety problems through scheduled testing and integrated engineering design procedures however safety in the maritime domain includes two additional categories system safety and human safety sadeghi et al 2016 system safety akeel and bell 2013 involves the application of engineering and management criteria principles and techniques in order to optimize safety within the constraints of time cost and operational effectiveness throughout all phases of a system s lifecycle system safety is to safety as systems engineering is to engineering sadeghi et al 2015 in engineering design system safety is only addressed to improve engineering design sadeghi et al 2015 and to determine ways in which systems can be used without risk rausand and utne 2009 human safety is impacted by system safety akeel and bell 2013 and is determined by safe human engagement with technology human safety is also related to the non functioning part of a system or the part of a system that follows certain conditions for a given amount of time human factors engineers analyze human safety in terms of systems use and behavior this approach is different for marine engineers and engineering designers who understand that human safety is connected to technology and work procedures bal et al 2015 human factors engineers also look at the issue to optimize routing and scheduling on behalf of workers health and safety with a focus on psychosocial factors and musculoskeletal disorders lützhöft 2004 recent research has determined that since organizational cultures can influence the choices of individuals safety is also affected by human and organizational factors chauvin et al 2013 international atomic energy agency 2013 some of these organizational factors include resource management organizational climate organizational process and statutory requirements every one of these factors affects supervisory actions as well as the conditions and unsafe actions of marine operators understanding organizational factors can aid in the protection of human safety at an organizational level regardless the natural cooperation of marine operators within work environments might be dismissed upon investigation of human safety issues from a holistic perspective as such this paper aims to illustrate how field work can be used to drive bottom up social and technical innovations between the work as imagined and work as done mantras of the maritime domain in terms of top down risk management organizational factors exist outside of the scope of this paper det norske veritas 2001 palola 2015 by contrast human safety in the maritime domain is multifaceted first safety occurs within the context of marine operations such as through the resolution of mechanical issues within technical systems rausand and utne 2009 second because human machine interactions are led by institutions there are both physical and software related consequences to safety backalov et al 2016a b therefore human safety can be considered to be dependent on the safety of a ship s stability backalov et al 2016a b as an example human safety may be considered to be paramount during investigations of a ship s structural requirements for complete control human safety can also be used to measure the probability for select operations such as navigation and offshore activities and to test marine operators in the selection of certain criteria such as loading conditions and wave vessel and seaway geometry stanton 2014 in the current maritime domain human safety involves reliably backing up internal and external devices dunn 2003 to ensure safety within systems development from this perspective marine engineers primarily focus on analyzing safety regulations and designing work procedures so that individual marine operators are capable of using technical systems to some extent human safety is dismissed within cooperative work in addition human factors engineers and engineering designers contribute to human safety in marine operations as a presumptive condition for the enhancement of marine safety unfortunately while these presumptive conditions dominate natural work situations we believe they are inadequate because they are limited in their scope of safety precautions moreover a marine operator s primary role is to protect systems by avoiding operational human risk we argue that human safety should involve performance safety rather than risk prevention wachter and yorio 2014 human safety does not function in an isolated context that engineers can explain by communicating within their own fields faye 2009 as an engineering field the current maritime domain involves straightforward problem solving faye 2009 for human safety issues without any in depth study of the in situ work practices of end users lurås 2016 we argue that this type of problem solving solution does not lead to a better understanding of operator performance within the field of engineering kwee meier et al 2016 rather it only helps when operations and machines are fit for use in individual work practices in marine operations human safety should involve more than individual circumstances it should instead adopt a holistic view of cooperation amongst domain professionals daniellou et al 2011 goodwin 1994 argued that professionals are people who have the ability to highlight and respond to the work situations that unfold before them in their fields these individuals develop knowledge from their work environments their previous experiences and the theories that underlie their professional educations jung et al 2010 it is therefore important that engineering practices in the maritime domain relate to the context of human safety kwee meier et al 2016 so that the in situ work practices within cooperative work environments can be visualized this can bridge the gap between the work as imagined and work as done mantras of the maritime domain as an example several researchers have suggested that performance adjustments to engineering practices are necessary as most people change their work output to match specific situations in these cases performance variability is inevitable ubiquitous and necessary in a variety of fields such as healthcare braithwaite et al 2017 wears et al 2014 aviation and nuclear power hollnagel 1993 failure to recognize the nature of work practices can lead to oversimplified incomplete and outdated knowledge about work circumstances and thus result in the poor performance of certain engineered systems braithwaite et al 2017 as such the visualization of in situ work practices within cooperative work environments can support human safety as an explicit discussable transferrable and growable element of engineering work engineering communities need to rethink human safety s classification as a boundary object for socio technical innovation by bringing together the different engineering practices that shape marine operational systems engineering communities should also encourage in situ engineering work by allowing engineers to use the knowledge that is inherent to their individual communities during the overall design of safety operations 3 the empirical setting the marine operational systems on a ship s bridge this paper s empirical setting was the marine operational systems of a ship s bridge see fig 1 the field study was conducted on the bridge of an offshore supply vessel wherein operators used marine operational systems to complete offshore tasks the crew on deck in addition to the communications that took place between the offshore supply vessel and the oil platform were also considered to be part of the research area information that was useful to the maritime operators were displayed via 18 displays and physical operational levers see fig 1 dynamic positioning systems were placed in two screens in front of the marine operators chairs the automatic integrated systems ais included two screens in front of and a screen in between the two marine operators chairs we chose ais and dynamic positioning dp systems because we believe that dp systems that are associated with ais and other marine operational systems represent basic functionality for most simple marine operations and services ais are programed to monitor and provide alerts for the storage of liquid materials in containers that rest under a ship s bridge these systems significantly increase a ship s reliability automation heinzmann 2017 detect process malfunctions faster and reduce operators intervention times during marine services transportation research board 2003 as an example marine operators could use ais to provide drilling mud and water to the oil platform while simultaneously establishing the balance of a vessel pan 2016 thus this study focuses on the work of two teams of marine operators who used both marine operational systems ais and dp systems every 6 h each time record included two marine operators who belonged to a single team sailors on deck who assisted the marine operators on the ship s bridge were also involved in this study 4 method the work presented here is part of a larger project that examines marine operations the aim of this project is to criticize the existing design of marine operational systems move beyond these criticisms of current marine technologies in a constructive manner and attempt to influence specific features of the creation and implementation of marine operations safety after receiving approved ethical consent from the norwegian centre for research data the study began in the fall of 2013 it is currently nearing completion it is an empirical workplace study that can be divided into three phases with different but highly interlinked focuses since the focuses of many of the activities overlap so that the parts of each phase influence the findings of other phases it is impossible to distinguish each research activity by phases therefore the three phases are as follows 1 the investigation of marine operational systems with a focus on cooperative work within group activities 2 the development of a design based approach to marine operational systems which in turn supports cooperative work between marine operators and design engineers during the engineering design process 3 an investigation in the design of marine operations safety in order to shape a developmental environment for the design of marine operational systems with a focus on safety regulations and the rules of work procedures while this paper focuses on the third phase empirical observations from all three parts of the study contribute to its empirical foundation in the first two phases the focus was to investigate the problems and challenges in evaluating marine operational systems that became present during research at sea with marine operators one of the main findings from the first phase was that the evaluation of interactions between marine operators and marine operational systems inadequately represented safety concerns at sea in addition the study determined that current design and evaluative methods dismiss the safety issues of marine operators work practices at the cooperative level moreover phase two used a network based approach to investigate systems development with a focus on cooperative work during the engineering design process in other words the design of marine operational systems that support cooperative safety operations should involve design researchers and engineering designers by integrating the in situ work practices of marine operators into the design of engineering systems the empirical study presented in this paper relates to the first and second phase it is also comprised of an in depth analysis of the safety issues related to work practices and is embedded within a larger picture of how marine operations safety is designed we seek to use a boundary object as an analytical lens this object exists in various fields of engineering during the design of marine operational systems that account for human safety by placing each engineering community s practices under this analytical lens a conceptual framework that uses the work practices of every engineering field in the maritime domain can be organized around the design of marine operational systems and provide knowledge that drives marine operational systems to support marine operations safety the primary data that this paper uses are comprised of various research activities that contribute to the understanding of marine operators work practices within marine operational systems the primary activities include observations of the work practices informal and formal interviews with marine operators and analyses of the various artifacts in use the observations of work practices took place during six sets of offshore trips each set of trips included roughly 14 observations that lasted between 7 and 11 days long from january to may in 2015 wherein the primary author of this paper observed the work practices and marine operational systems on the ship s bridge while conducting formal and informal interviews with the marine operators about their work these observations focused primarily on how marine operators cooperated with each other and used the marine operational systems to monitor tasks that required a certain degree of safety such as activities that took place above deck the interviews were conducted when safety issues or unusual operations e g work outside of planned work procedures occurred in this paper the field notes that were taken during the offshore trips are represented below in the form of a series of vignettes these notes can be used to analyze how the consideration of human safety in work practices can allow design researchers to use a boundary object as an analytical lens which in turn can be used to evaluate how human safety can be identified and managed in every engineering community that uses non cooperative practices during marine operations however human safety requires a cooperative and holistic view of marine operations that enables the incorporation of different engineering communities to design marine operations safety protocols that are suitable to those who conduct field work the following is an excerpt from the field notes that were taken by this paper s primary author the first officer and the captain sit in front of the marine operational systems interface the first officer checks all the paper forms before he starts dp operations his colleague the captain helps him check the weather information using separate office systems it is clear that these office systems are not part of marine operational systems and are located in a different place the first officer notes weather data on his paper forms as the captain speaks out these paper forms are pre prepared in order to document important information such as dp operations during marine operations these are requests from the shipping company that concern safety issues for example the paper forms need to log dates time place weather information and who is on duty during marine operations in specific paper form such as the dp checklist form information about sea wave wind and engine status also need to be documented all these forms will be sent back to the shipping company time and again the first officer positions the vessel approaching the bergen platform bergen is a pseudonym for the platform s name after successfully positioning the vessel at the correct place he stops and holds the vessel s position the captain picks up the communication device and dials a number to call bergen he asks bergen if the crane operator is ready to help adjust the vessel s position then he calls to the sailors on deck to check the position of the crane the crane on the oil platform is too high for the first officer even though the crane operator tries to put down a rig the first officer s sight line is also blocked by the frame of the window on the ship s bridge he has to stand up to observe where the crane is because it is difficult for the sailors on deck to accurately explain the position of the crane simultaneously he hands over dp operations to the captain who can help to hold and adjust the position of the vessel the captain positions the vessel at the right place with the guidance of the first officer and the sailor on deck after dp operations the first officer prepares to supply bergen he confirms the work tasks that are documented on the forms from the shipping company then he orders the sailors on deck and the crane operator on bergen to connect the hose between bergen and the offshore vessel after the hose is connected he turns on the service to pump mud type i from the offshore vessel to bergen at the same time the captain asks bergen to lower the containers that will be brought back onshore when lowering the containers the captain has to guide the sailor on deck to position the containers at specific locations this is because these marine service operations also change the balance of the vessel mud type i also carries weight suddenly bergen tells the first officer to stop delivery of the mud supplement instead bergen asks for drilling mud type vi and tells the first officer that a change form has already been sent to the office systems this change is not planned the captain therefore has to stop guiding the sailors on deck and move to the office systems location the captain asks the first officer to hold the vessel s position and guide the sailors on deck to lower the containers for him the captain turns on the computer and printer to print out the request from bergen for checking and approval although he tries to guide the sailors on deck to position the container he fails to communicate with them as his workload at this moment makes communication impossible he cannot hold the vessel guide the sailors on deck and monitor the marine services all at once in addition the marine service system has an error one pump is not working he is aware that this may cause trouble even though he intends to ignore it suddenly both the engine room engineers and the chief call the bridge to draw attention to the balance of the vessel the first officer stops the marine services but is only able to maintain the position of the vessel and its balance by shifting the mud below deck from one side to the other he does not know how much mud should be shifted so he makes his best estimate field notes in 2015 5 boundary objects star and griesemer 1989 introduced the concept of boundary object to facilitate knowledge into how various actors who are involved in a task can cooperate on a project in spite of their different backgrounds and varied often conflicting interests they gave an example that the work of amateurs professionals administrators and others connected to the museum of vertebrate zoology at the university of california berkeley had n ways to translate their own knowledge of an object according to star and griesemer a boundary object is any object that is part of multiple social worlds and facilitates communication between them it has a different identity in each social world that it inhabits boundary objects embody a number of perspectives and are used by multiple groups to serve their own purposes and to address their own concerns while facilitating translation and understanding between several groups at the same time boundary objects do not equate to agreement but rather to interpretive flexibility trompette and vinck 2010 as star and griesemer 1989 asserted boundary objects are objects which are both plastic enough to adapt to local needs and the constraints of the several parties employing them yet robust enough to maintain a common identity across sites like a blackboard a boundary object sits in the middle of a group of actors with divergent viewpoints when bringing boundary objects into practice bowker and star 2000 focused on ways in which to classify them according to different communities of practice or social worlds certain objects can become naturalized and routinely used by members of a community so that their function becomes transparent and they are taken for granted by members of that community bowker and star 2000 boundary objects can therefore be understood as objects that are not fully naturalized by any one community of practice instead they arise from situations where two or more differently naturalized classification systems collide vederhus and pan 2016 thus boundary objects aid in the negotiation of areas of overlap between multiple communities and are created from within field studies so that they may build and structure an ecology wherein each community can find its bearings and make headway trompette and vinck 2010 every engineering community understands human safety and the design of marine operational systems in particular differently while human safety is robustly considered by each engineering community flexibility as a holistic feature of marine operations safety at large is frequently misunderstood for example the traditional routes for designing safety marine operations vederhus and pan 2016 involve national and international regulations and the design of work procedures by marine engineers in order to train marine operators according to their experiences e g their personal communications with marine engineers following this engineering designers and human factors engineers work on constructing marine operational systems and their associated equipment so that they may place them within vessels work procedures can change depending on the training processes that are required to operate marine operational systems however while marine operators are trained to follow these work procedures with regards to safety concerns they do not provide feedback on the design of marine operational systems or their application within marine operation safety during in situ work practices thus when safety issues or unusual work procedures present themselves during cooperative work practices there exists a division between operators human factors engineers marine engineers and engineering designers and their ability to cooperate on a specific design in other words marine engineers engineering designers and human factors engineers loosely contribute in the design of marine operation safety and only address safety issues within their individual communities of practice see fig 2 in addition the construction processes of marine operational systems follow the traditional developmental processes of systems engineering rigo et al 2010 these can include the use of stakeholder wishes and requirements without considering the in situ work practices of marine operators by design engineers vederhus and pan 2016 following this design engineers write these opinions and desires on small pieces of paper stick them on a wall and wait for their approval by human factors engineers we believe that the in situ cooperative work practices of marine operators are usually viewed as social factors that can be automatically excluded during developmental processes it is difficult to bridge the gap between the social and engineering approaches to the developmental process dourish 2006 human safety does not fall easily into the categories of engineering design marine engineering or human factors engineering human safety is in itself an object that can facilitate internal group interactions in a positive way trompette and vinck 2010 the elements of human safety are closely related to the competencies of the different engineering fields trompette and vinck 2010 therefore human safety is represented in the different engineering communities by the technical errors that present themselves within marine operational systems backalov et al 2016a b interaction failures between marine operators and marine operational systems stanton 2014 and communication faults pyne and koester 2005 that occur during maritime tasks however when a boundary object is applied as an analytical tool to evaluate human safety it is important to note that human safety is also a holistic artifact that requires design researchers to incorporate the approaches of different engineering fields in the design of marine operations safety at large while cooperative work between end users is a factor that has been largely dismissed in day to day engineering practices manzini 2015 argued that it remains an important issue to develop socio technical systems that support cooperative work experts must co design these systems using bottom up processes that combine social and technological innovations the work of marine operators and marine engineers needs to become visible because marine operations are unique and each operation has its own work procedure they must be represented with field notes so that engineering designers can better understand the in situ work practices of marine operators in addition marine engineers should adjust work procedures and make the effort to inform engineering designers about manners of safety thus boundary objects are useful analytical tools that can bring different engineering practices together while illustrating how cooperative operations can be framed as socio technical systems that support holistic human safety below we use a boundary object to analyze human safety within a series of vignettes investigating how different engineering practices can contribute to incompatible approaches to safety within cooperative marine operations we then establish human safety as a boundary object to inform the design of marine operational systems and affirm that these design processes require cooperation between marine engineers marine operators engineering designers and human factors engineers 6 human safety issues in cooperative marine operations dp operations are typically designed by an operator so that they adhere to the work procedures that are necessary to run the dp systems however according to the first officer s field work these work procedures were expanded during the events that we recorded aboard the offshore vessel dp operations and initial cooperative work involve the captain the crane operator and the sailors on deck and are comprised of paper forms the communication systems and the dp systems see fig 3 when positioning the vessel the first officer is unable to communicate with the crane operator on the oil platform it is therefore unsafe for the first officer to hand over his work to the captain who operates the dp systems directly in addition when the captain initiates dp operations the dp systems lack updated weather information the captain is also unable to check the office systems since they are in a different location however safety issues typically do not arise during this type of field work because the first officer is tasked with observing the crane for the captain in addition he communicates with both the captain and the sailors on deck and checks for current weather data on the captain s behalf once the vessel reached the correct position the first officer initiated the next marine operation providing mud type i to the platform in the meantime the captain began guiding the sailors on deck to lower the containers following this dp operations were joined with another set of marine service operations see fig 4 the captain and first officer participated in both teams and used their knowledge of each operation type to inform the other participants when the ship received a call from the platform to stop delivering mud type i operations had to make a change to enable the captain to sign and approve the change forms using the office systems which were not synchronized with any portable devices at the captain s disposal thus the captain needed to return to his office area to collect the email the first officer maintained the position of the vessel while acquiring the information he needed through the communications systems so that he could continue delivery of mud type i he was also responsible for maintaining the vessel s balance through both the marine services and the dp systems when a change request from the oil platform required a change from mud type i to vi there was a lack of information a lack of cooperative work between marine operators can raise safety issues that include technical errors interaction failures and communication faults in turn these can result in the destabilization of the vessel the first human safety issue that occurred was a technical error within the marine service systems when one of the pumps stopped working nevertheless the first officer continued his duties until the mud type was changed the pump does not work for two days i have to continue my work even though there is something wrong for a little work i do not think it will matter i do not know what will happen if we have to work with a platform for a long time to provide mud while the first officer was aware of an error he chose to ignore it the captain went to the location of the office systems because the first officer was unable to change from one mud type to another without both the captain s and the shipping company s authority thus the work of guiding and monitoring the containers shifted from the captain to the first officer making the safety situation worse it was an impossible task because the first officer could not communicate directly with the crane operator to lift the containers in addition the first officer and the captain had no information about the weight of the containers while the crane operator knew this information limited communication prevented the marine operators from gaining access to this information beforehand when the captain left the marine service operations to check the office systems the first officer had no way of updating his work with new information in addition he was unable to stop his work on dp or marine services or in his guiding and monitoring of the containers therefore he continued work on these operations until he was no longer able to proceed this paper s primary author interviewed both the first officer and the captain simultaneously after the shift in work duties that had come as result of the request to change mud type when asked about the relationship between work capabilities and the safety issue of balancing the vessel the captain responded as follows no information can alert us to possible safety issues if i the captain leave my work to him the first officer because if i have to get approval from the company i cannot wait for a long time you know we have already waited here for a day i need to save time for more operations i just hand over my work for a minute to him the first officer i assume everything is good because this imbalance issue does not happen often this time the imbalance issue may be because the containers are overweight the primary author then asked if they were aware of the weight of those containers and if it was possible to gain access to that information beforehand both of them answered no they only had access to a document that listed basic information about the containers such as company names the same applied to the work procedures for marine service operations they were not allowed to update paper forms for marine services due to a number of regulations that had been set in place by the oil company although the office systems received updates this information was not shared with the first officer as the captain reported the work plan for marine service operations is revised by the shipping company and the oil company however the work plan may be revised again during marine operations at sea we have no idea when it will be changed also i cannot check it on my operational systems even though i have some screens here in the marine operational area when i sit here to work on service operations with the first officer i have to stop from time to time to see if there is a request from the oil company this is quite annoying you already saw but i have to do it after he had taken responsibility for monitoring and guiding the containers the first officer knew when he needed to communicate with the sailors on deck as he was unaware of how much the container weighed his guidance to the sailors on deck was incomplete the primary author followed up with questions on this issue by asking the first officer if he had experience in handling two operations at the same time the purpose of this question was to determine if the first officer lacked experience or if inexperience was even an issue the first officer said i have seven years experience on marine operations mainly working on the bridge i think this is not the first time i have seen imbalance issues i communicate with the sailors but i am unable to tell them how to guide the crane to place it in a specific place do you remember that there is an error in the system that is okay even though it is an error however most importantly i lack information about which side of the vessel is light for example we have different types of muds and they have different densities i cannot get this information from my dp and service systems therefore i just use my experience with the vessel if the left side is high then i give instructions to lower the left side of the vessel for example i guide the sailors using my experience the sailors on deck confirmed this the author asked many of the sailors how they communicated with the crane operators on the oil platform about container information one of those sailors responded we have a communication system with the crane operator gestures however we do not have any information about the containers our work is to guide the crane operator to place the container at the right place on deck gestures do not tell us anything about the weight of a container the primary author then referred back to the captain and the first officer to inquire about the correct locations for the containers the captain said i usually have a pre planned form marked with different colors i use that form to guide sailors on deck as to where to place a container however it is just a paper with some colors it does not help much to balance the vessel because it does not always match the information regarding what types of mud we have those two things go hand in hand and must work together that is a mathematical problem well it is in my experience using the above analysis we discovered safety issue that can occur during operational systems cooperation when two operations focus solely on one piece of a scheduled work procedure within marine operational systems there are fewer safety issues because marine operators are aware of the complexity of marine operations and are trained to react properly to safety issues that occur during marine operations in the above example for instance the first officer would have been able to safely run dp operations and provide mud to the platform it should be noted that marine operators are trained to perform these solo operations via an interview that is administered on board every two years however imbalance issues see fig 5 occur when cooperative work fails to proceed smoothly while there may be fewer technical errors in marine operational systems and fewer problems when marine operators interact with marine operational systems on an individual basis human safety problems can arise when these pieces of distinct work are put together in the above example for instance the captain would have been unable to approve the paper forms for marine service operations without permission from the shipping company see red line in fig 5 these problems can occur when the oil platform sends a digital request to the vessel see red line between office systems and the oil platform in fig 5 this type of request does not appear in the marine operational systems as a result the captain has less opportunity to check it during collaborative dp and marine service operations this event also prevents the first officer from monitoring the containers see red line in fig 5 therefore according to our disciplinary perspective there is a broken line between the cooperative work of the dp and marine service operations this broken line indicates the limitations of engineering practices in their ability to adequately support human safety during the design of marine operational systems while one may call this holistic human safety issue a typical event this paper refers to the phenomenon as an imbalance line see fig 5 human safety is a dynamic performance process that occurs between marine operators and marine operational systems we found that safety issues rarely transpire during individual work practices because marine engineers engineering designers and human factors engineers are capable of planning marine operations with minimum human safety issues by debugging technical errors applying good interaction styles and preparing informative maritime course training once a marine operational system has been built however safety issues arise within cooperative marine operations when unusual issues such as the changes to mud type in the above example emerge these issues can impact anything from the work procedures of marine operators to the technical aspects of marine operational systems hence although the first officer hands over his work to the captain he also plays the role of shift supervisor coordinating information and communication to the captain e g observing the crane and communicating with the sailors on deck if we use the concept of boundary object to analyze these safety issues we can determine that human safety is a boundary object that is well understood within each engineering community and that every community holds different opinions and engineering standards in their approaches to safety regardless it is doubtful that engineers can solve human safety problems within a cooperative work environment we see that human safety problems in marine operational systems can be solved individually within each engineering community and that human safety is flexible enough for different engineering practices to effectively develop marine technology for individual marine tasks such as dp operations however human safety is not supported when different marine operational systems come together for cooperative use as these collaborations lack communication and interaction between sub tasks and are incapable of producing revisions to the work procedures or engineering design processes of marine operational systems 7 from vignette analysis to suggestions for the safe design of marine operational systems 7 1 visualizing in situ work practices when a captain hands his work over to the first officer the office systems should synchronize the dp systems with real time weather data this is important for the first officer so that he may keep the dp operations as safe as possible which in turn can impact the success of the marine service operations the sailors on deck who guide crane operations should have an open communication channel with the crane operator in addition this channel should be available to the first officer and the crane operator so that they may safely pump mud it would also help the first officer to learn how to shift mud inside the vessel so that he can maintain balance during marine service operations furthermore paper based forms should be updated to ensure that new and correct information is provided to both the captain and the first officer in the case that this paper explored this would have allowed the captain to have checked and approved the change request without increasing the workload of the first officer marine service systems should provide information about a vessel s balance status or at least reveal to the first officer the amount of mud that needs to shifted from a certain container to another in order to balance the vessel if human safety is related to the internal relationship between marine operators and marine operational systems at the individual level then holistic human safety is related to the external relationship between various marine tasks at the cooperative work level as an example when the dp system expands to become integrated with marine service operations the first officer becomes involved with the internal human safety of dp operations in addition he is simultaneously involved in marine service operations with the captain and other crew members such as the sailors on deck this expanded role can result in minor safety issues as the first officer may become overwhelmed by these additional duties a technical error in the marine service systems may not be a dp operations issue however as this internal error can interfere with cooperative work performance it will also not be an isolated error this paper s primary author examined the internal relationship between marine operators and marine operational systems and the external relationship between various marine tasks at the cooperative level with the marine operators by asking them how do you understand the role of human safety in cooperative marine operations they answered as follows first officer if i could have real time information regarding my operations both dp operations and marine service operations i could manage both operations safely i also need a clear communication channel between the crane operator and myself between the sailors on deck and myself in that case i could confirm the information that i need to do my work i think that is very important thus safety for me means i can successfully operate those computer systems internally and deal with my colleagues then i can exchange information and communicate with others for cooperation sailors on deck we think communication is very important we need to know who we are talking to and what information we need to pass on we also need to know the work plan in order to position the containers in the right places if this is changed we may not need to know how the crane operator works but we want to make our own work better and show safety to others captain i think it is important to have good interactions with information between different working groups if i can approve the change request immediately here rather than trotting back and forth and if i can also control the dp systems with correct information then i think it is will be safer and more effective for the safety of everyone i also think not all information needs to come to me to process and control because i am also on my own operation and i have to focus on my work with good technical systems skilled crews and great communication systems for exchanging information i believe we would have good safety safety in cooperative marine operations is understood by marine operators as the material they use that surrounds them as they cooperate with others in their opinion they need to use the correct resources rather than be issued orders to properly complete tasks in their understanding human safety is a process that occurs in both the technical and human domains to a create a safe and cooperative environment for their operations and each other they focus on technical problems and adapt to their own and the technical system s performances as the first officer noted our team for example the captain and i the first officer may not be familiar with others in most operations in a year hence human safety in my understanding is how your work can cooperate with others and their environments safely while this statement is speaking on behalf of marine operators it also confirms that the tools and systems they use play a part in cooperative work marine operators are experts in their field as a result marine operational systems should provide solo operations for cooperative work operations but also allow for autonomous relationships to form between different operations cooperators this understanding creates a space where human safety is robust enough to enable different engineering communities to work on an operation according to their own standards and internal relationships see inside the circles red lines and mutual ways shared practices between different engineering communities in fig 6 lampland and star 2009 it should also be flexible enough to produce a holistic understanding of the external relationships burman 2004 that exist within cooperative marine operations see the broken black line in fig 6 as an example sailors need to communicate both verbally with crane operators and with gestures see red line in fig 5 crane operators also need to communicate with the oil platform in order to assist the first officer who can then obtain information regarding the services he is working on see red line in fig 5 in addition the captain should be able to approve marine service operation forms digitally and without the need to relocate to a separate location the shipping company should also be able to access the office systems on the ship s bridge and approve requests sent by the captain in other words office systems should not be isolated from marine operational systems rather office systems should be improved to assist both the captain and the first officer in their working positions of the marine operational area in sum human safety should be transferred from a high level of cooperative operations to marine service operations dp operations and office operations as three individual digital environments see three circles in fig 6 with their own marine operators and operational systems 8 integrating engineering communities practices in the support of marine operations safety design through our analysis marine operations safety may no longer require engineering designers and human factors engineers to prepare marine operational systems nor for marine engineers to train marine operators in work procedures that adhere to the rules for different marine tasks that are covered by marine operational systems in situ work enables the use of field work as an engineering practice its usage can remind maritime engineers that pre planned work procedures may not be suitable for professional marine operators work procedures should be revised to match the in situ cooperative work of marine operators who are involved in marine operational systems design researchers should engage in cooperative work environments and observe and interview marine operators to better understand what constitutes cooperative work and how cooperative safety can be formed for every marine task by reshaping operation systems to support safe and cooperative work this activity can aid in the design of marine operational systems so that they better support holistic human safety this type of research could also help in the identification of improvements that can be made to the individual engineering community s practices and technical equipment decreasing the rate of technical errors interaction failures and communication faults finally these steps could allow researchers to better support individual work practices within operational systems it is worth noting that the design of marine operations safety is an iterative process for instance field studies can aid in the development of knowledge about marine operators in situ work practices prior to the establishment of a unique cooperative work environment the in situ work practices of operators can reveal problems that exist within current cooperative work environments they can also lead to better design in the positioning of new functions new operators and new work procedures the design of cooperative work environments requires engineering communities to transfer more than their design and engineering activities design research and engineering studies must work together to form a more holistic understanding of human safety and work practices practices in the engineering communities could benefit from a richer discussion about the stabilization of socio technical systems by encouraging design researchers engineering designers human factors engineers and marine engineers to collaborate in the production of socio technical innovations that can improve cooperative work supporting human safety in the practices of engineering communities requires the creation of a boundary object ellinas et al 2016 researchers have supported the value of enabling engineering communities to share their practices with other communities petersen and buch 2016 this can be achieved by applying knowledge buch 2016 that exists outside of the current ecology of engineering work the primary author of this paper is an advocate of schmidt s 2011 paper which asserted that collaborative engineering communities should enable socio technical innovations from the bottom up so that they involve professionals in the field and make their performances visible during the developmental processes of socio technical systems in addition collaborative engineering communities could successfully cooperate with other research fields in an effort to bring about new ideas and encourage other organizations to share information across boundaries that exist between the engineering communities engineering work requires a considerable amount of reporting from the field in addition to the formation of relationships that are based on negotiations for maneuverability between different engineering communities field work can shed light on the development of technical systems that support cooperative work practices which can improve human safety if human safety is considered to be a part of the greater picture of engineering community practices that incorporate both individual and cooperative work traditional engineering in the maritime domain may change during the design of systems that support cooperative work design researchers observe in situ work practices to make cooperative work visible these work practices are solidly embodied by the performances of marine operators and can offer non technical knowledge to marine engineers who typically do not address them in their work as vinck 2014 asserted field work can emphasize the importance of the dynamics of interaction and exchange between actors the production and circulation of multiple intermediary objects and the building of the compromises between actor professionals with varying viewpoints in summary actors become connected through the definition of problems the integration of knowledge and the search for solutions and their implementation the practices of engineering communities include reports about daily work tasks these reports refer to the ways in which people make use of their work skills and share their perspectives by pointing out details engineering community practices thus involve the collective knowledge of multiple actors so that they may benefit from both tacit and formal types of knowledge in sum when design researchers engage in field work they are able to map out problems related to technical issues and work procedures through observations and interviews on the one hand these efforts can inform marine engineers to modify their work procedures so that they align with the in situ cooperative work practices of marine operators who are attempting to address safety concerns these endeavors can also compel marine engineers to take part in the development of marine operations safety rather than isolating them from the process as these work procedures are created as mentioned work procedures are dynamically related to the in situ work practices of marine operators it is therefore important that marine engineers be involved in marine operations safety design so that the in situ work practices of marine operators and the work procedures of marine engineers each contribute to the design of marine operational systems for engineering designers and human factors engineers on the other hand these efforts can influence engineering designers and human factors engineers to make changes to marine operational systems that better support cooperative safety practices and which are based on field work and new working procedures rather than the development of operational systems that only support the work of individual operators amongst marine operators marine operational systems support marine operations safety it is therefore vital that marine operational systems are designed to consider the in situ work practices of marine operators by observing the in situ work practices of marine operators and collecting knowledge from marine engineers and design researchers marine operational systems can adopt a holistic approach to human safety for the engineering practices of design and human factors engineers cooperation between these different actors design researchers marine engineers engineering designers human factors engineers and marine operators involves the occurrence of multiple activities at specific times and places according to suchman 2000 these times and places are interwoven with the network or relationship that actors strive to connect as boundary objects are created from within field study the process of conducting field studies reveals that human safety is comprised of the actors who are involved the systems and equipment that are used and the way that cooperative work is carried out 9 conclusions in order to adopt a holistic view of human safety in the design of marine operations this paper employed boundary object to analyze the concept by evaluating a series of vignettes the paper determined that human safety can be identified and supported within each engineering community s practices however human safety does not address the in situ work practices of cooperative marine operators who perform marine operations indeed there is a gap that exists between marine operators marine engineers engineering designers and human factors engineers during the design of marine operational systems that are built to support holistic human safety within cooperative marine operations thus we promoted the collaboration between design researchers who engage in field work and marine operators who promote human safety we then used this partnership as a boundary object wherein marine engineers design researchers marine operators engineering designers and human factors engineers could cooperate in the design of holistic marine operations safety in this manner human safety can be designed by using the work procedures and in situ work practices of marine operators to inform the design of marine operational systems that support safety within cooperative operations acknowledgements the first author would like to thank sisse finken for her invaluable comments on the early manuscript we also want to thank steinar nistad and terje fiskerstrand for their feedback on marine operations the research council of norway financed this work project number 237929 234007 
23616,to avoid safety issues current marine operations safety protocols follow only the work procedures and technical structures of systems that are provided by the operator regardless research continues to report safety issues related to cooperative work within marine operational systems thus we use the concept of boundary object to analyze excerpts from a series of field notes and to discuss holistic human safety we illustrate that human safety is only supported at the individual level of engineering community practices but does not address safety at a cooperative level between marine operations and other operations at the individual level human safety issues can be related to technical errors and failures in interaction and communication this paper presents suggestions on how to make the work practices of marine engineers and marine operators visible within design processes enabling them to collaborate with engineering designers and human factors engineers in the design of marine operations safety keywords holistic human safety marine operations safety standard cooperative work environment 1 introduction in the maritime domain research that focuses on the improvement of human safety is typically conducted by engineering designers these designers use a systematic design approach pahl et al 2007 to analyze and identify work situations from product and system design features this approach includes a set of theories and methods that can identify essential problems establish the functional structure of systems search for solution principles and combine them sadeghi et al 2016 marine engineers engineering designers and human factors engineers believe that human safety is consequently affected by technical systems kleiner et al 2015 from this perspective risks to human safety can be avoided through enhanced technologies and by training operators to follow appropriate work procedures for operations and the technical structures of systems as an example most marine engineers understand that human safety is impacted by marine operations safety can therefore be ensured by designing work procedures that adhere to national and international regulations det norske maskinistforbund 2013 marine engineers approach human safety by considering how to make work procedures suitable to every unique marine operation that marine operators encounter because it is an attribute that exists within technologies engineering designers can secure human safety with advanced technologies sadeghi et al 2015 therefore human safety can be measured through appropriate experimentation by human factors engineers lützhöft 2004 human factors engineers believe that human safety risks can be avoided by iterating upon enhanced technologies during design processes and by evaluating the interactions between the operators and interfaces of those technologies thus studies in maritime research have followed these approaches during attempts to solve human safety issues amongst marine operators and marine operational systems within cooperative work environments these studies have used a variety of methods such as marine operational systems to enable cooperative work which have been developed with collective and individual computer systems alike park et al 2004 however existing literature aas 2010 has continued to report human error as a causal or contributing factor in 60 90 of all accidents baker and mccafferty 2005 of these approximately 50 of maritime accidents have been the result of human errors that existed outside of the context of technical systems in addition baker and mccafferty 2005 revealed that 30 of marine safety incidents resulted from human failure to avoid accidents during cooperative work the nature of human safety in marine operations safety is complex kongsberg 2016 marine operations are highly cooperative and require multiple marine operators to use marine operational systems within cooperative and socio technical environments hepsø 1997 when marine operators use marine operational systems human safety issues do not always arise at the individual level rather these issues can emerge from cooperative work that takes place between marine operators and marine operational systems forskningsrådet 2012 in design research researchers have argued that when cooperative work is considered to be a part of the social fabric of design it is often overlooked during the design of cooperative operations technology manzini 2015 as such we believe that understanding safety in the context of individual engineering work like the design of safety features for an engineering system to support holistic human safety within cooperative operations can lead to inadequate engineering work in the maritime domain although many researchers have called for holistic engineering work practices to support in situ work and socio technical innovations few studies have focused on methods that can merge social and technological characteristics in order to solve engineering problems for example petersen and buch 2016 explored how the user experience approach synthesized engineering practices at a car manufacturer by enabling certain engineering methodologies to work across various engineering organizations however their study failed to explain how users could participate in engineering work to make their efforts visible rather petersen and buch focused primarily on engineers who estimated car buyer s purchasing requirements so that they could restructure engineering organizations by contrast we argue that in current marine operational systems the in situ work practices of marine operators and marine engineers are largely invisible because they are typically unobserved star and strauss 1999 in order to improve and extend marine operational systems and to address the ecology of marine operations safety we intend to make this work visible to gain this new understanding of human safety in engineering work we use the concept of boundary object which according to star and griesemer 1989 is robust enough to allow researchers of design research to collaborate with other engineering practices and to analyze and investigate human safety as a boundary object human safety requires marine operators marine engineers design researchers and engineering designers to address the safety operations of every stage of marine operation this can enable engineering designers and design researchers to shape marine operational systems within the context of marine operators and their cooperative work in addition if we treat human safety as a robust feature that permits marine engineers design engineers and human factors engineers to practice marine technology at the individual level of their different communities human safety can be supported through the use of enhanced technical systems backalov et al 2016a b and institutional work procedures in addition if human safety can be made flexible it can be supported by enriching the social meaning of engineering practices from a holistic human safety perspective within cooperative work environments which can in turn allow marine operators to vocalize their opinions about the in situ cooperative work practices of marine operations to marine engineers and increase their ability to perform efficient work procedures this paper s definition of holistic human safety therefore refers to good cooperation amongst various engineering communities during the design of marine operations safety protocols that support cooperative marine operators the paper s research questions include the following what type of marine operational systems can provide holistic support to human safety what methods can be used to design these systems and the involvement of what types of knowledge from the different engineering communities marine engineering design research engineering design and human factors engineering can be used to support marine operations safety in addition the paper will be structured as follows section 2 will discuss the definition of the word safety and the current understanding of human safety within the maritime domain section 3 will introduce the empirical setting section 4 will present the data collection and methods that are used in this paper and section 5 will use a boundary object to illustrate how marine operational systems and human safety are built within field studies in order to make the work involved in marine operations visible during the design of marine operations safety the paper will also review the processes that demand cooperation between design researchers and design maritime and human factors engineers using analyses of earlier field work that was conducted at sea this paper will argue for the importance of integrating the work of marine operators and marine engineers into common engineering practices such as designing operational systems and ensuring ecology within marine operations safety finally section 7 will explore methods that can enrich engineering work so that it can support a variety of marine operations the paper will then conclude that designers and engineers will need to use the outcomes of field work to drive bottom up socio technical innovations that can force the evolution of both social and technical practices and support human safety in cooperative work environments such as marine operations 2 what is safety and human safety in the maritime domain despite the common interest in safety and human safety in the maritime domain definitions for both remain insufficient it should therefore be made clear that this paper s position on human safety is different than most engineering studies by comparing with safety and human safety in the maritime domain according to the national aeronautics and space administration nasa 2008 safety focuses exclusively on physical rather than functional consequences in terms of product safety a product is considered to be safe when it does not result in death injury occupational illness damage to the environment and damage to or loss of equipment or property by comparison research related to marine engineering engineering design and human factors engineering considers human safety to be a part of the machinery safety process khan et al 2015 wherein machinery control systems are modeled to guard against predictable safety problems through scheduled testing and integrated engineering design procedures however safety in the maritime domain includes two additional categories system safety and human safety sadeghi et al 2016 system safety akeel and bell 2013 involves the application of engineering and management criteria principles and techniques in order to optimize safety within the constraints of time cost and operational effectiveness throughout all phases of a system s lifecycle system safety is to safety as systems engineering is to engineering sadeghi et al 2015 in engineering design system safety is only addressed to improve engineering design sadeghi et al 2015 and to determine ways in which systems can be used without risk rausand and utne 2009 human safety is impacted by system safety akeel and bell 2013 and is determined by safe human engagement with technology human safety is also related to the non functioning part of a system or the part of a system that follows certain conditions for a given amount of time human factors engineers analyze human safety in terms of systems use and behavior this approach is different for marine engineers and engineering designers who understand that human safety is connected to technology and work procedures bal et al 2015 human factors engineers also look at the issue to optimize routing and scheduling on behalf of workers health and safety with a focus on psychosocial factors and musculoskeletal disorders lützhöft 2004 recent research has determined that since organizational cultures can influence the choices of individuals safety is also affected by human and organizational factors chauvin et al 2013 international atomic energy agency 2013 some of these organizational factors include resource management organizational climate organizational process and statutory requirements every one of these factors affects supervisory actions as well as the conditions and unsafe actions of marine operators understanding organizational factors can aid in the protection of human safety at an organizational level regardless the natural cooperation of marine operators within work environments might be dismissed upon investigation of human safety issues from a holistic perspective as such this paper aims to illustrate how field work can be used to drive bottom up social and technical innovations between the work as imagined and work as done mantras of the maritime domain in terms of top down risk management organizational factors exist outside of the scope of this paper det norske veritas 2001 palola 2015 by contrast human safety in the maritime domain is multifaceted first safety occurs within the context of marine operations such as through the resolution of mechanical issues within technical systems rausand and utne 2009 second because human machine interactions are led by institutions there are both physical and software related consequences to safety backalov et al 2016a b therefore human safety can be considered to be dependent on the safety of a ship s stability backalov et al 2016a b as an example human safety may be considered to be paramount during investigations of a ship s structural requirements for complete control human safety can also be used to measure the probability for select operations such as navigation and offshore activities and to test marine operators in the selection of certain criteria such as loading conditions and wave vessel and seaway geometry stanton 2014 in the current maritime domain human safety involves reliably backing up internal and external devices dunn 2003 to ensure safety within systems development from this perspective marine engineers primarily focus on analyzing safety regulations and designing work procedures so that individual marine operators are capable of using technical systems to some extent human safety is dismissed within cooperative work in addition human factors engineers and engineering designers contribute to human safety in marine operations as a presumptive condition for the enhancement of marine safety unfortunately while these presumptive conditions dominate natural work situations we believe they are inadequate because they are limited in their scope of safety precautions moreover a marine operator s primary role is to protect systems by avoiding operational human risk we argue that human safety should involve performance safety rather than risk prevention wachter and yorio 2014 human safety does not function in an isolated context that engineers can explain by communicating within their own fields faye 2009 as an engineering field the current maritime domain involves straightforward problem solving faye 2009 for human safety issues without any in depth study of the in situ work practices of end users lurås 2016 we argue that this type of problem solving solution does not lead to a better understanding of operator performance within the field of engineering kwee meier et al 2016 rather it only helps when operations and machines are fit for use in individual work practices in marine operations human safety should involve more than individual circumstances it should instead adopt a holistic view of cooperation amongst domain professionals daniellou et al 2011 goodwin 1994 argued that professionals are people who have the ability to highlight and respond to the work situations that unfold before them in their fields these individuals develop knowledge from their work environments their previous experiences and the theories that underlie their professional educations jung et al 2010 it is therefore important that engineering practices in the maritime domain relate to the context of human safety kwee meier et al 2016 so that the in situ work practices within cooperative work environments can be visualized this can bridge the gap between the work as imagined and work as done mantras of the maritime domain as an example several researchers have suggested that performance adjustments to engineering practices are necessary as most people change their work output to match specific situations in these cases performance variability is inevitable ubiquitous and necessary in a variety of fields such as healthcare braithwaite et al 2017 wears et al 2014 aviation and nuclear power hollnagel 1993 failure to recognize the nature of work practices can lead to oversimplified incomplete and outdated knowledge about work circumstances and thus result in the poor performance of certain engineered systems braithwaite et al 2017 as such the visualization of in situ work practices within cooperative work environments can support human safety as an explicit discussable transferrable and growable element of engineering work engineering communities need to rethink human safety s classification as a boundary object for socio technical innovation by bringing together the different engineering practices that shape marine operational systems engineering communities should also encourage in situ engineering work by allowing engineers to use the knowledge that is inherent to their individual communities during the overall design of safety operations 3 the empirical setting the marine operational systems on a ship s bridge this paper s empirical setting was the marine operational systems of a ship s bridge see fig 1 the field study was conducted on the bridge of an offshore supply vessel wherein operators used marine operational systems to complete offshore tasks the crew on deck in addition to the communications that took place between the offshore supply vessel and the oil platform were also considered to be part of the research area information that was useful to the maritime operators were displayed via 18 displays and physical operational levers see fig 1 dynamic positioning systems were placed in two screens in front of the marine operators chairs the automatic integrated systems ais included two screens in front of and a screen in between the two marine operators chairs we chose ais and dynamic positioning dp systems because we believe that dp systems that are associated with ais and other marine operational systems represent basic functionality for most simple marine operations and services ais are programed to monitor and provide alerts for the storage of liquid materials in containers that rest under a ship s bridge these systems significantly increase a ship s reliability automation heinzmann 2017 detect process malfunctions faster and reduce operators intervention times during marine services transportation research board 2003 as an example marine operators could use ais to provide drilling mud and water to the oil platform while simultaneously establishing the balance of a vessel pan 2016 thus this study focuses on the work of two teams of marine operators who used both marine operational systems ais and dp systems every 6 h each time record included two marine operators who belonged to a single team sailors on deck who assisted the marine operators on the ship s bridge were also involved in this study 4 method the work presented here is part of a larger project that examines marine operations the aim of this project is to criticize the existing design of marine operational systems move beyond these criticisms of current marine technologies in a constructive manner and attempt to influence specific features of the creation and implementation of marine operations safety after receiving approved ethical consent from the norwegian centre for research data the study began in the fall of 2013 it is currently nearing completion it is an empirical workplace study that can be divided into three phases with different but highly interlinked focuses since the focuses of many of the activities overlap so that the parts of each phase influence the findings of other phases it is impossible to distinguish each research activity by phases therefore the three phases are as follows 1 the investigation of marine operational systems with a focus on cooperative work within group activities 2 the development of a design based approach to marine operational systems which in turn supports cooperative work between marine operators and design engineers during the engineering design process 3 an investigation in the design of marine operations safety in order to shape a developmental environment for the design of marine operational systems with a focus on safety regulations and the rules of work procedures while this paper focuses on the third phase empirical observations from all three parts of the study contribute to its empirical foundation in the first two phases the focus was to investigate the problems and challenges in evaluating marine operational systems that became present during research at sea with marine operators one of the main findings from the first phase was that the evaluation of interactions between marine operators and marine operational systems inadequately represented safety concerns at sea in addition the study determined that current design and evaluative methods dismiss the safety issues of marine operators work practices at the cooperative level moreover phase two used a network based approach to investigate systems development with a focus on cooperative work during the engineering design process in other words the design of marine operational systems that support cooperative safety operations should involve design researchers and engineering designers by integrating the in situ work practices of marine operators into the design of engineering systems the empirical study presented in this paper relates to the first and second phase it is also comprised of an in depth analysis of the safety issues related to work practices and is embedded within a larger picture of how marine operations safety is designed we seek to use a boundary object as an analytical lens this object exists in various fields of engineering during the design of marine operational systems that account for human safety by placing each engineering community s practices under this analytical lens a conceptual framework that uses the work practices of every engineering field in the maritime domain can be organized around the design of marine operational systems and provide knowledge that drives marine operational systems to support marine operations safety the primary data that this paper uses are comprised of various research activities that contribute to the understanding of marine operators work practices within marine operational systems the primary activities include observations of the work practices informal and formal interviews with marine operators and analyses of the various artifacts in use the observations of work practices took place during six sets of offshore trips each set of trips included roughly 14 observations that lasted between 7 and 11 days long from january to may in 2015 wherein the primary author of this paper observed the work practices and marine operational systems on the ship s bridge while conducting formal and informal interviews with the marine operators about their work these observations focused primarily on how marine operators cooperated with each other and used the marine operational systems to monitor tasks that required a certain degree of safety such as activities that took place above deck the interviews were conducted when safety issues or unusual operations e g work outside of planned work procedures occurred in this paper the field notes that were taken during the offshore trips are represented below in the form of a series of vignettes these notes can be used to analyze how the consideration of human safety in work practices can allow design researchers to use a boundary object as an analytical lens which in turn can be used to evaluate how human safety can be identified and managed in every engineering community that uses non cooperative practices during marine operations however human safety requires a cooperative and holistic view of marine operations that enables the incorporation of different engineering communities to design marine operations safety protocols that are suitable to those who conduct field work the following is an excerpt from the field notes that were taken by this paper s primary author the first officer and the captain sit in front of the marine operational systems interface the first officer checks all the paper forms before he starts dp operations his colleague the captain helps him check the weather information using separate office systems it is clear that these office systems are not part of marine operational systems and are located in a different place the first officer notes weather data on his paper forms as the captain speaks out these paper forms are pre prepared in order to document important information such as dp operations during marine operations these are requests from the shipping company that concern safety issues for example the paper forms need to log dates time place weather information and who is on duty during marine operations in specific paper form such as the dp checklist form information about sea wave wind and engine status also need to be documented all these forms will be sent back to the shipping company time and again the first officer positions the vessel approaching the bergen platform bergen is a pseudonym for the platform s name after successfully positioning the vessel at the correct place he stops and holds the vessel s position the captain picks up the communication device and dials a number to call bergen he asks bergen if the crane operator is ready to help adjust the vessel s position then he calls to the sailors on deck to check the position of the crane the crane on the oil platform is too high for the first officer even though the crane operator tries to put down a rig the first officer s sight line is also blocked by the frame of the window on the ship s bridge he has to stand up to observe where the crane is because it is difficult for the sailors on deck to accurately explain the position of the crane simultaneously he hands over dp operations to the captain who can help to hold and adjust the position of the vessel the captain positions the vessel at the right place with the guidance of the first officer and the sailor on deck after dp operations the first officer prepares to supply bergen he confirms the work tasks that are documented on the forms from the shipping company then he orders the sailors on deck and the crane operator on bergen to connect the hose between bergen and the offshore vessel after the hose is connected he turns on the service to pump mud type i from the offshore vessel to bergen at the same time the captain asks bergen to lower the containers that will be brought back onshore when lowering the containers the captain has to guide the sailor on deck to position the containers at specific locations this is because these marine service operations also change the balance of the vessel mud type i also carries weight suddenly bergen tells the first officer to stop delivery of the mud supplement instead bergen asks for drilling mud type vi and tells the first officer that a change form has already been sent to the office systems this change is not planned the captain therefore has to stop guiding the sailors on deck and move to the office systems location the captain asks the first officer to hold the vessel s position and guide the sailors on deck to lower the containers for him the captain turns on the computer and printer to print out the request from bergen for checking and approval although he tries to guide the sailors on deck to position the container he fails to communicate with them as his workload at this moment makes communication impossible he cannot hold the vessel guide the sailors on deck and monitor the marine services all at once in addition the marine service system has an error one pump is not working he is aware that this may cause trouble even though he intends to ignore it suddenly both the engine room engineers and the chief call the bridge to draw attention to the balance of the vessel the first officer stops the marine services but is only able to maintain the position of the vessel and its balance by shifting the mud below deck from one side to the other he does not know how much mud should be shifted so he makes his best estimate field notes in 2015 5 boundary objects star and griesemer 1989 introduced the concept of boundary object to facilitate knowledge into how various actors who are involved in a task can cooperate on a project in spite of their different backgrounds and varied often conflicting interests they gave an example that the work of amateurs professionals administrators and others connected to the museum of vertebrate zoology at the university of california berkeley had n ways to translate their own knowledge of an object according to star and griesemer a boundary object is any object that is part of multiple social worlds and facilitates communication between them it has a different identity in each social world that it inhabits boundary objects embody a number of perspectives and are used by multiple groups to serve their own purposes and to address their own concerns while facilitating translation and understanding between several groups at the same time boundary objects do not equate to agreement but rather to interpretive flexibility trompette and vinck 2010 as star and griesemer 1989 asserted boundary objects are objects which are both plastic enough to adapt to local needs and the constraints of the several parties employing them yet robust enough to maintain a common identity across sites like a blackboard a boundary object sits in the middle of a group of actors with divergent viewpoints when bringing boundary objects into practice bowker and star 2000 focused on ways in which to classify them according to different communities of practice or social worlds certain objects can become naturalized and routinely used by members of a community so that their function becomes transparent and they are taken for granted by members of that community bowker and star 2000 boundary objects can therefore be understood as objects that are not fully naturalized by any one community of practice instead they arise from situations where two or more differently naturalized classification systems collide vederhus and pan 2016 thus boundary objects aid in the negotiation of areas of overlap between multiple communities and are created from within field studies so that they may build and structure an ecology wherein each community can find its bearings and make headway trompette and vinck 2010 every engineering community understands human safety and the design of marine operational systems in particular differently while human safety is robustly considered by each engineering community flexibility as a holistic feature of marine operations safety at large is frequently misunderstood for example the traditional routes for designing safety marine operations vederhus and pan 2016 involve national and international regulations and the design of work procedures by marine engineers in order to train marine operators according to their experiences e g their personal communications with marine engineers following this engineering designers and human factors engineers work on constructing marine operational systems and their associated equipment so that they may place them within vessels work procedures can change depending on the training processes that are required to operate marine operational systems however while marine operators are trained to follow these work procedures with regards to safety concerns they do not provide feedback on the design of marine operational systems or their application within marine operation safety during in situ work practices thus when safety issues or unusual work procedures present themselves during cooperative work practices there exists a division between operators human factors engineers marine engineers and engineering designers and their ability to cooperate on a specific design in other words marine engineers engineering designers and human factors engineers loosely contribute in the design of marine operation safety and only address safety issues within their individual communities of practice see fig 2 in addition the construction processes of marine operational systems follow the traditional developmental processes of systems engineering rigo et al 2010 these can include the use of stakeholder wishes and requirements without considering the in situ work practices of marine operators by design engineers vederhus and pan 2016 following this design engineers write these opinions and desires on small pieces of paper stick them on a wall and wait for their approval by human factors engineers we believe that the in situ cooperative work practices of marine operators are usually viewed as social factors that can be automatically excluded during developmental processes it is difficult to bridge the gap between the social and engineering approaches to the developmental process dourish 2006 human safety does not fall easily into the categories of engineering design marine engineering or human factors engineering human safety is in itself an object that can facilitate internal group interactions in a positive way trompette and vinck 2010 the elements of human safety are closely related to the competencies of the different engineering fields trompette and vinck 2010 therefore human safety is represented in the different engineering communities by the technical errors that present themselves within marine operational systems backalov et al 2016a b interaction failures between marine operators and marine operational systems stanton 2014 and communication faults pyne and koester 2005 that occur during maritime tasks however when a boundary object is applied as an analytical tool to evaluate human safety it is important to note that human safety is also a holistic artifact that requires design researchers to incorporate the approaches of different engineering fields in the design of marine operations safety at large while cooperative work between end users is a factor that has been largely dismissed in day to day engineering practices manzini 2015 argued that it remains an important issue to develop socio technical systems that support cooperative work experts must co design these systems using bottom up processes that combine social and technological innovations the work of marine operators and marine engineers needs to become visible because marine operations are unique and each operation has its own work procedure they must be represented with field notes so that engineering designers can better understand the in situ work practices of marine operators in addition marine engineers should adjust work procedures and make the effort to inform engineering designers about manners of safety thus boundary objects are useful analytical tools that can bring different engineering practices together while illustrating how cooperative operations can be framed as socio technical systems that support holistic human safety below we use a boundary object to analyze human safety within a series of vignettes investigating how different engineering practices can contribute to incompatible approaches to safety within cooperative marine operations we then establish human safety as a boundary object to inform the design of marine operational systems and affirm that these design processes require cooperation between marine engineers marine operators engineering designers and human factors engineers 6 human safety issues in cooperative marine operations dp operations are typically designed by an operator so that they adhere to the work procedures that are necessary to run the dp systems however according to the first officer s field work these work procedures were expanded during the events that we recorded aboard the offshore vessel dp operations and initial cooperative work involve the captain the crane operator and the sailors on deck and are comprised of paper forms the communication systems and the dp systems see fig 3 when positioning the vessel the first officer is unable to communicate with the crane operator on the oil platform it is therefore unsafe for the first officer to hand over his work to the captain who operates the dp systems directly in addition when the captain initiates dp operations the dp systems lack updated weather information the captain is also unable to check the office systems since they are in a different location however safety issues typically do not arise during this type of field work because the first officer is tasked with observing the crane for the captain in addition he communicates with both the captain and the sailors on deck and checks for current weather data on the captain s behalf once the vessel reached the correct position the first officer initiated the next marine operation providing mud type i to the platform in the meantime the captain began guiding the sailors on deck to lower the containers following this dp operations were joined with another set of marine service operations see fig 4 the captain and first officer participated in both teams and used their knowledge of each operation type to inform the other participants when the ship received a call from the platform to stop delivering mud type i operations had to make a change to enable the captain to sign and approve the change forms using the office systems which were not synchronized with any portable devices at the captain s disposal thus the captain needed to return to his office area to collect the email the first officer maintained the position of the vessel while acquiring the information he needed through the communications systems so that he could continue delivery of mud type i he was also responsible for maintaining the vessel s balance through both the marine services and the dp systems when a change request from the oil platform required a change from mud type i to vi there was a lack of information a lack of cooperative work between marine operators can raise safety issues that include technical errors interaction failures and communication faults in turn these can result in the destabilization of the vessel the first human safety issue that occurred was a technical error within the marine service systems when one of the pumps stopped working nevertheless the first officer continued his duties until the mud type was changed the pump does not work for two days i have to continue my work even though there is something wrong for a little work i do not think it will matter i do not know what will happen if we have to work with a platform for a long time to provide mud while the first officer was aware of an error he chose to ignore it the captain went to the location of the office systems because the first officer was unable to change from one mud type to another without both the captain s and the shipping company s authority thus the work of guiding and monitoring the containers shifted from the captain to the first officer making the safety situation worse it was an impossible task because the first officer could not communicate directly with the crane operator to lift the containers in addition the first officer and the captain had no information about the weight of the containers while the crane operator knew this information limited communication prevented the marine operators from gaining access to this information beforehand when the captain left the marine service operations to check the office systems the first officer had no way of updating his work with new information in addition he was unable to stop his work on dp or marine services or in his guiding and monitoring of the containers therefore he continued work on these operations until he was no longer able to proceed this paper s primary author interviewed both the first officer and the captain simultaneously after the shift in work duties that had come as result of the request to change mud type when asked about the relationship between work capabilities and the safety issue of balancing the vessel the captain responded as follows no information can alert us to possible safety issues if i the captain leave my work to him the first officer because if i have to get approval from the company i cannot wait for a long time you know we have already waited here for a day i need to save time for more operations i just hand over my work for a minute to him the first officer i assume everything is good because this imbalance issue does not happen often this time the imbalance issue may be because the containers are overweight the primary author then asked if they were aware of the weight of those containers and if it was possible to gain access to that information beforehand both of them answered no they only had access to a document that listed basic information about the containers such as company names the same applied to the work procedures for marine service operations they were not allowed to update paper forms for marine services due to a number of regulations that had been set in place by the oil company although the office systems received updates this information was not shared with the first officer as the captain reported the work plan for marine service operations is revised by the shipping company and the oil company however the work plan may be revised again during marine operations at sea we have no idea when it will be changed also i cannot check it on my operational systems even though i have some screens here in the marine operational area when i sit here to work on service operations with the first officer i have to stop from time to time to see if there is a request from the oil company this is quite annoying you already saw but i have to do it after he had taken responsibility for monitoring and guiding the containers the first officer knew when he needed to communicate with the sailors on deck as he was unaware of how much the container weighed his guidance to the sailors on deck was incomplete the primary author followed up with questions on this issue by asking the first officer if he had experience in handling two operations at the same time the purpose of this question was to determine if the first officer lacked experience or if inexperience was even an issue the first officer said i have seven years experience on marine operations mainly working on the bridge i think this is not the first time i have seen imbalance issues i communicate with the sailors but i am unable to tell them how to guide the crane to place it in a specific place do you remember that there is an error in the system that is okay even though it is an error however most importantly i lack information about which side of the vessel is light for example we have different types of muds and they have different densities i cannot get this information from my dp and service systems therefore i just use my experience with the vessel if the left side is high then i give instructions to lower the left side of the vessel for example i guide the sailors using my experience the sailors on deck confirmed this the author asked many of the sailors how they communicated with the crane operators on the oil platform about container information one of those sailors responded we have a communication system with the crane operator gestures however we do not have any information about the containers our work is to guide the crane operator to place the container at the right place on deck gestures do not tell us anything about the weight of a container the primary author then referred back to the captain and the first officer to inquire about the correct locations for the containers the captain said i usually have a pre planned form marked with different colors i use that form to guide sailors on deck as to where to place a container however it is just a paper with some colors it does not help much to balance the vessel because it does not always match the information regarding what types of mud we have those two things go hand in hand and must work together that is a mathematical problem well it is in my experience using the above analysis we discovered safety issue that can occur during operational systems cooperation when two operations focus solely on one piece of a scheduled work procedure within marine operational systems there are fewer safety issues because marine operators are aware of the complexity of marine operations and are trained to react properly to safety issues that occur during marine operations in the above example for instance the first officer would have been able to safely run dp operations and provide mud to the platform it should be noted that marine operators are trained to perform these solo operations via an interview that is administered on board every two years however imbalance issues see fig 5 occur when cooperative work fails to proceed smoothly while there may be fewer technical errors in marine operational systems and fewer problems when marine operators interact with marine operational systems on an individual basis human safety problems can arise when these pieces of distinct work are put together in the above example for instance the captain would have been unable to approve the paper forms for marine service operations without permission from the shipping company see red line in fig 5 these problems can occur when the oil platform sends a digital request to the vessel see red line between office systems and the oil platform in fig 5 this type of request does not appear in the marine operational systems as a result the captain has less opportunity to check it during collaborative dp and marine service operations this event also prevents the first officer from monitoring the containers see red line in fig 5 therefore according to our disciplinary perspective there is a broken line between the cooperative work of the dp and marine service operations this broken line indicates the limitations of engineering practices in their ability to adequately support human safety during the design of marine operational systems while one may call this holistic human safety issue a typical event this paper refers to the phenomenon as an imbalance line see fig 5 human safety is a dynamic performance process that occurs between marine operators and marine operational systems we found that safety issues rarely transpire during individual work practices because marine engineers engineering designers and human factors engineers are capable of planning marine operations with minimum human safety issues by debugging technical errors applying good interaction styles and preparing informative maritime course training once a marine operational system has been built however safety issues arise within cooperative marine operations when unusual issues such as the changes to mud type in the above example emerge these issues can impact anything from the work procedures of marine operators to the technical aspects of marine operational systems hence although the first officer hands over his work to the captain he also plays the role of shift supervisor coordinating information and communication to the captain e g observing the crane and communicating with the sailors on deck if we use the concept of boundary object to analyze these safety issues we can determine that human safety is a boundary object that is well understood within each engineering community and that every community holds different opinions and engineering standards in their approaches to safety regardless it is doubtful that engineers can solve human safety problems within a cooperative work environment we see that human safety problems in marine operational systems can be solved individually within each engineering community and that human safety is flexible enough for different engineering practices to effectively develop marine technology for individual marine tasks such as dp operations however human safety is not supported when different marine operational systems come together for cooperative use as these collaborations lack communication and interaction between sub tasks and are incapable of producing revisions to the work procedures or engineering design processes of marine operational systems 7 from vignette analysis to suggestions for the safe design of marine operational systems 7 1 visualizing in situ work practices when a captain hands his work over to the first officer the office systems should synchronize the dp systems with real time weather data this is important for the first officer so that he may keep the dp operations as safe as possible which in turn can impact the success of the marine service operations the sailors on deck who guide crane operations should have an open communication channel with the crane operator in addition this channel should be available to the first officer and the crane operator so that they may safely pump mud it would also help the first officer to learn how to shift mud inside the vessel so that he can maintain balance during marine service operations furthermore paper based forms should be updated to ensure that new and correct information is provided to both the captain and the first officer in the case that this paper explored this would have allowed the captain to have checked and approved the change request without increasing the workload of the first officer marine service systems should provide information about a vessel s balance status or at least reveal to the first officer the amount of mud that needs to shifted from a certain container to another in order to balance the vessel if human safety is related to the internal relationship between marine operators and marine operational systems at the individual level then holistic human safety is related to the external relationship between various marine tasks at the cooperative work level as an example when the dp system expands to become integrated with marine service operations the first officer becomes involved with the internal human safety of dp operations in addition he is simultaneously involved in marine service operations with the captain and other crew members such as the sailors on deck this expanded role can result in minor safety issues as the first officer may become overwhelmed by these additional duties a technical error in the marine service systems may not be a dp operations issue however as this internal error can interfere with cooperative work performance it will also not be an isolated error this paper s primary author examined the internal relationship between marine operators and marine operational systems and the external relationship between various marine tasks at the cooperative level with the marine operators by asking them how do you understand the role of human safety in cooperative marine operations they answered as follows first officer if i could have real time information regarding my operations both dp operations and marine service operations i could manage both operations safely i also need a clear communication channel between the crane operator and myself between the sailors on deck and myself in that case i could confirm the information that i need to do my work i think that is very important thus safety for me means i can successfully operate those computer systems internally and deal with my colleagues then i can exchange information and communicate with others for cooperation sailors on deck we think communication is very important we need to know who we are talking to and what information we need to pass on we also need to know the work plan in order to position the containers in the right places if this is changed we may not need to know how the crane operator works but we want to make our own work better and show safety to others captain i think it is important to have good interactions with information between different working groups if i can approve the change request immediately here rather than trotting back and forth and if i can also control the dp systems with correct information then i think it is will be safer and more effective for the safety of everyone i also think not all information needs to come to me to process and control because i am also on my own operation and i have to focus on my work with good technical systems skilled crews and great communication systems for exchanging information i believe we would have good safety safety in cooperative marine operations is understood by marine operators as the material they use that surrounds them as they cooperate with others in their opinion they need to use the correct resources rather than be issued orders to properly complete tasks in their understanding human safety is a process that occurs in both the technical and human domains to a create a safe and cooperative environment for their operations and each other they focus on technical problems and adapt to their own and the technical system s performances as the first officer noted our team for example the captain and i the first officer may not be familiar with others in most operations in a year hence human safety in my understanding is how your work can cooperate with others and their environments safely while this statement is speaking on behalf of marine operators it also confirms that the tools and systems they use play a part in cooperative work marine operators are experts in their field as a result marine operational systems should provide solo operations for cooperative work operations but also allow for autonomous relationships to form between different operations cooperators this understanding creates a space where human safety is robust enough to enable different engineering communities to work on an operation according to their own standards and internal relationships see inside the circles red lines and mutual ways shared practices between different engineering communities in fig 6 lampland and star 2009 it should also be flexible enough to produce a holistic understanding of the external relationships burman 2004 that exist within cooperative marine operations see the broken black line in fig 6 as an example sailors need to communicate both verbally with crane operators and with gestures see red line in fig 5 crane operators also need to communicate with the oil platform in order to assist the first officer who can then obtain information regarding the services he is working on see red line in fig 5 in addition the captain should be able to approve marine service operation forms digitally and without the need to relocate to a separate location the shipping company should also be able to access the office systems on the ship s bridge and approve requests sent by the captain in other words office systems should not be isolated from marine operational systems rather office systems should be improved to assist both the captain and the first officer in their working positions of the marine operational area in sum human safety should be transferred from a high level of cooperative operations to marine service operations dp operations and office operations as three individual digital environments see three circles in fig 6 with their own marine operators and operational systems 8 integrating engineering communities practices in the support of marine operations safety design through our analysis marine operations safety may no longer require engineering designers and human factors engineers to prepare marine operational systems nor for marine engineers to train marine operators in work procedures that adhere to the rules for different marine tasks that are covered by marine operational systems in situ work enables the use of field work as an engineering practice its usage can remind maritime engineers that pre planned work procedures may not be suitable for professional marine operators work procedures should be revised to match the in situ cooperative work of marine operators who are involved in marine operational systems design researchers should engage in cooperative work environments and observe and interview marine operators to better understand what constitutes cooperative work and how cooperative safety can be formed for every marine task by reshaping operation systems to support safe and cooperative work this activity can aid in the design of marine operational systems so that they better support holistic human safety this type of research could also help in the identification of improvements that can be made to the individual engineering community s practices and technical equipment decreasing the rate of technical errors interaction failures and communication faults finally these steps could allow researchers to better support individual work practices within operational systems it is worth noting that the design of marine operations safety is an iterative process for instance field studies can aid in the development of knowledge about marine operators in situ work practices prior to the establishment of a unique cooperative work environment the in situ work practices of operators can reveal problems that exist within current cooperative work environments they can also lead to better design in the positioning of new functions new operators and new work procedures the design of cooperative work environments requires engineering communities to transfer more than their design and engineering activities design research and engineering studies must work together to form a more holistic understanding of human safety and work practices practices in the engineering communities could benefit from a richer discussion about the stabilization of socio technical systems by encouraging design researchers engineering designers human factors engineers and marine engineers to collaborate in the production of socio technical innovations that can improve cooperative work supporting human safety in the practices of engineering communities requires the creation of a boundary object ellinas et al 2016 researchers have supported the value of enabling engineering communities to share their practices with other communities petersen and buch 2016 this can be achieved by applying knowledge buch 2016 that exists outside of the current ecology of engineering work the primary author of this paper is an advocate of schmidt s 2011 paper which asserted that collaborative engineering communities should enable socio technical innovations from the bottom up so that they involve professionals in the field and make their performances visible during the developmental processes of socio technical systems in addition collaborative engineering communities could successfully cooperate with other research fields in an effort to bring about new ideas and encourage other organizations to share information across boundaries that exist between the engineering communities engineering work requires a considerable amount of reporting from the field in addition to the formation of relationships that are based on negotiations for maneuverability between different engineering communities field work can shed light on the development of technical systems that support cooperative work practices which can improve human safety if human safety is considered to be a part of the greater picture of engineering community practices that incorporate both individual and cooperative work traditional engineering in the maritime domain may change during the design of systems that support cooperative work design researchers observe in situ work practices to make cooperative work visible these work practices are solidly embodied by the performances of marine operators and can offer non technical knowledge to marine engineers who typically do not address them in their work as vinck 2014 asserted field work can emphasize the importance of the dynamics of interaction and exchange between actors the production and circulation of multiple intermediary objects and the building of the compromises between actor professionals with varying viewpoints in summary actors become connected through the definition of problems the integration of knowledge and the search for solutions and their implementation the practices of engineering communities include reports about daily work tasks these reports refer to the ways in which people make use of their work skills and share their perspectives by pointing out details engineering community practices thus involve the collective knowledge of multiple actors so that they may benefit from both tacit and formal types of knowledge in sum when design researchers engage in field work they are able to map out problems related to technical issues and work procedures through observations and interviews on the one hand these efforts can inform marine engineers to modify their work procedures so that they align with the in situ cooperative work practices of marine operators who are attempting to address safety concerns these endeavors can also compel marine engineers to take part in the development of marine operations safety rather than isolating them from the process as these work procedures are created as mentioned work procedures are dynamically related to the in situ work practices of marine operators it is therefore important that marine engineers be involved in marine operations safety design so that the in situ work practices of marine operators and the work procedures of marine engineers each contribute to the design of marine operational systems for engineering designers and human factors engineers on the other hand these efforts can influence engineering designers and human factors engineers to make changes to marine operational systems that better support cooperative safety practices and which are based on field work and new working procedures rather than the development of operational systems that only support the work of individual operators amongst marine operators marine operational systems support marine operations safety it is therefore vital that marine operational systems are designed to consider the in situ work practices of marine operators by observing the in situ work practices of marine operators and collecting knowledge from marine engineers and design researchers marine operational systems can adopt a holistic approach to human safety for the engineering practices of design and human factors engineers cooperation between these different actors design researchers marine engineers engineering designers human factors engineers and marine operators involves the occurrence of multiple activities at specific times and places according to suchman 2000 these times and places are interwoven with the network or relationship that actors strive to connect as boundary objects are created from within field study the process of conducting field studies reveals that human safety is comprised of the actors who are involved the systems and equipment that are used and the way that cooperative work is carried out 9 conclusions in order to adopt a holistic view of human safety in the design of marine operations this paper employed boundary object to analyze the concept by evaluating a series of vignettes the paper determined that human safety can be identified and supported within each engineering community s practices however human safety does not address the in situ work practices of cooperative marine operators who perform marine operations indeed there is a gap that exists between marine operators marine engineers engineering designers and human factors engineers during the design of marine operational systems that are built to support holistic human safety within cooperative marine operations thus we promoted the collaboration between design researchers who engage in field work and marine operators who promote human safety we then used this partnership as a boundary object wherein marine engineers design researchers marine operators engineering designers and human factors engineers could cooperate in the design of holistic marine operations safety in this manner human safety can be designed by using the work procedures and in situ work practices of marine operators to inform the design of marine operational systems that support safety within cooperative operations

23617,a problem of a planing surface moving steadily at finite froude numbers in a laterally restricted seaway is considered in this note a linearized potential flow method based on point sources is applied to model hydrodynamics of a planing plate numerical results are obtained and presented for the lift coefficient and the center of pressure the variable parameters include the ratio of the channel width to the plate beam beam based froude number and nominal aspect ratio of the plate a comparison is shown with empirical correlations for unrestricted seaway and with theoretical results for the limiting two dimensional case keywords planing hulls restricted seaway potential flow theory numerical modeling 1 introduction it is well known that restricted seaways can significantly affect hydrodynamics of traditional ship hulls e g tuck 1978 zhou et al 2012 the confined flow phenomena are also important for air supported marine vehicles e g doctors 1993 rozhdestvensky 2000 finite depth effects on planing craft hydrodynamics were discovered and studied in the past as well as recently e g green 1935 morabito 2013 hence it can be also presumed that laterally restricted seaways may have a significant impact on the planing boat performance determining the influence of the channel width on the lift coefficient and the center of pressure of the simplest planing configuration a flat plate is a subject of this communication somewhat related to the present problem are studies of planing catamarans where hydrodynamic interactions between demi hulls are found to modify hydrodynamic properties of each demi hull e g savitsky and dingee 1954 bari and matveev 2016 a linearized potential flow method is applied in this work to model steady hydrodynamics of a planing plate in a channel three dimensional planing surfaces in unrestricted seaway were previously analyzed with related linearized potential flow approaches wang and rispin 1971 derived an analytical solution for a plate planing at high but finite froude numbers doctors 1974 1975 and wellicome and jahangeer 1979 employed a distribution of pressure elements on planing surfaces cheng and wellicome 1994 developed a pressure strip method for planing hulls to achieve better numerical convergence xie at al 2005 and wang and day 2007 gave further recommendations on how to avoid numerical instabilities in the pressure element methods in the present study a distribution of point hydrodynamic sources placed on the boundaries of the water domain is utilized the numerical model is built upon our previous modeling efforts that addressed various configurations of planing hulls e g matveev and ockfen 2009 bari and matveev 2016 developed cavitating flows matveev and miller 2011 and air supported marine craft matveev 2014 2 mathematical model a general schematic for the numerical model is given in fig 1 a flat plate with trim angle α is steadily planing on a water surface in a deep infinitely long channel parallel to the channel walls the water flow is considered to be inviscid and irrotational at the channel boundaries z w 2 the flow velocity normal to the walls must be zero to satisfy this condition an equivalent problem of an infinite series of identical plates planing parallel to each other can be analyzed instead of a single channel with rigid walls a fragment of such a setup is shown in fig 1c the numerical domain also has upstream and downstream boundaries whose dimensions are discussed below in this communication only a brief outline of the mathematical model is given focusing on specifics of treating an infinite series of flow strips for other modeling details one can refer to our previous publications e g matveev and ockfen 2009 matveev 2014 bari and matveev 2016 the trim angle of the hull and the water surface slopes are assumed to be small so velocities of the disturbed flow caused by the presence of the plate are much smaller than the incident flow velocity u with respect to the plate then the problem can be linearized so that bernoulli equation on the water surface can be presented in a linear non dimensional form as follows 1 1 2 c p u u 2 π y w λ 0 where c p p p 0 ρ u 2 2 is the pressure coefficient zero on the free water surface p and p 0 are the pressure on the water surface and above the free surface respectively ρ is the water density u is the x component of the velocity perturbation y w is the water surface elevation λ 2 π u 2 g is the wavelength on the unconstrained free water surface and g is the gravity constant the flow disturbance under consideration can be modeled by a distribution of standard hydrodynamic sources placed on the water surface fig 1a and b a velocity potential of each source satisfies the laplace equation in the water domain the collocation points where eq 1 is fulfilled are shifted upstream from the sources this staggered arrangement removes the wave reflection from the downstream boundary of a numerical domain and ensures the radiation condition bertram 2000 due to symmetry in this problem with respect to x y plane and an infinite number of identical parallel flow strips associated with each planing plate the x component of the velocity perturbation in the starboard part of the central strip 0 z w 2 can be computed as follows 2 u x i c z i c 1 4 π j q j x i c x j s k 1 r i j k 3 1 r i j k 3 where x i c z i c and x j s z j s are the coordinates of the collocation point i and the source j with intensity q j located in the starboard part of the central strip and r i j k x i c x j s 2 z i c z j s k w 2 and r i j k x i c x j s 2 z i c z j s k w 2 are the distances between the considered collocation point and all the sources in all strips due to linearization the vertical distances of the sources and collocation points from the undisturbed water level are ignored in the expressions for distances the infinite summation in eq 2 accounts for the identical strips shifted along z axis by the integer number of the channel widths k w in the numerical implementation however one has to use a finite number of strips n so k n n determining the adequate quantity of strips that must be included to achieve results almost the same as those with the infinite number of strips is demonstrated in the next results section equation 1 represents the dynamic boundary condition for the present problem the linearized kinematic boundary condition on the water surface follows from a relation between the source strengths and the local water surface slope e g matveev 2014 3 1 2 q i 1 δ x i 1 δ z i 1 q i δ x i δ z i 2 u y i s y i 1 s x i s x i 1 s where q i 1 and q i are the source strengths of the upstream and downstream neighbors of the collocation point i and δ x and δ z are the intervals between the source locations in x and z directions on the wetted hull surface the source intensities can be immediately found from the given trim angle of the planing plate thus the linear system of equations eqs 1 3 can be formed the unknowns include water surface elevations outside the plate pressure coefficients on the plate source intensities and velocity perturbations the lift force on the hull and the center of pressure are found by simply integrating the obtained pressure distribution on the plate wetted surface the position of the center of pressure l p is measured from the transom and the lift coefficient c l is based on the plate beam 4 c l c p δ x δ z b 2 where the summation is carried out over the wetted plate area the current method allows us to evaluate the lift induced drag for a flat plate it is equal to the lift multiplied by the trim angle other drag components due to viscous effects cannot be directly obtained with the present inviscid model one of the specific features in the planing hydrodynamics is the initially unknown wetted areas of the planing surfaces since the water tends to rise in front of them fig 1a the water jet that appears above the water impingement point on the plate is neglected similar to riabouchinsky model applied for flows with developed cavitation e g matveev and ockfen 2009 the spray at the side edges of the plate is also ignored in the linear theory an iterative solution procedure is used to determine the final span dependent wetted length of the plate l w as it is not exactly known in the beginning since the spray is neglected the wetted length here represents the loaded length of the pressure zone on the plate an initial guess for the wetted length can be taken as the nominal wetted length l n defined as the distance between the plate stern and an intersection of the undisturbed water level and the hull plate surface fig 1a extensive validation studies of the present method have been carried out previously for 2d and 3d planing hulls including catamaran setups water surface profiles air cushion setups and underwater air cavities matveev and ockfen 2009 matveev and miller 2011 matveev 2014 bari and matveev 2016 additionally a comparison of the model results with empirical correlations of savitsky 1964 is shown in the next section no test data have been found in the literature for planing hulls operating in narrow channels the mesh independence studies conducted in this study with the plate planing in a channel gave the following recommendations to achieve converged results the mesh cell size a distance between sources should be chosen as at least b 6 with b being the plate beam and the upstream and downstream boundaries of the numerical domain need to be positioned at the distances 6 b and 10 b from the plate leading and trailing edges respectively as an example fig 2 illustrates the dependence of c l and l p on the total number of sources n in a fixed domain for the case of l n b 1 f r b u g b 2 and w b 2 the spacing between sources b 6 chosen for the following parametric calculations corresponds to the number of sources of about n 420 in this figure where convergence is clearly achieved 3 results one of the important questions in the present numerical model is the adequate selection of the number of parallel flow strips calculations have been carried out for different numbers of strips considering the following operating conditions for the planing plate l n b 3 f r b u g b 2 and w b 1 5 results for the lift slope and the center of pressure are given in fig 3 one can see that values of c l and l p saturate when the number of strips n becomes sufficiently high for subsequent calculations n 8 has been adopted to adequately represent the influence of the channel walls parametric calculations have been conducted in this study for two froude numbers f r b 2 and 4 plate nominal aspect ratios l n b 3 and 1 and a range of ratios of the channel width to the plate beam w b from 1 2 to 8 in very wide channels results become insensitive to the channel width whereas in very narrow channels with widths only slightly greater than the plate beam viscous and nonlinear effects are likely to be important which are beyond capabilities of the present mathematical model calculated results for the lift slope of the beam based lift coefficient the center of pressure and the mean wetted lengths are shown in figs 4 and 5 for illustration predictions by savitsky s empirical correlations for unrestricted seaway are also given by horizontal lines savitsky 1964 one can see that numerical results for a restricted problem approach savitsky s values in wide channels it should be noted that the exact agreement cannot be expected since simple correlations of savitsky can describe hydrodynamic characteristics only approximately in a broad range of boat parameters and speed regimes the numerical results indicate that the lift coefficient increases with a reduction of the channel width fig 4 this is caused by more confined flow at smaller channel widths so the flow starts transitioning toward a two dimensional pattern which produces higher lift force this effect is somewhat similar to hydrodynamic interactions between hulls in catamaran settings savitsky and dingee 1954 bari and matveev 2016 results show that nearly two fold increase of lift is possible in realistic narrow channels w b 1 5 also the lift coefficients of 3d plates are higher at smaller froude numbers stronger hydrostatic effect and longer hulls larger loaded areas these results are again consistent with savitsky s correlations in the studied range of parameters the centers of pressure generally demonstrate an increasing trend though more modest in magnitude with a decrease of the channel width fig 5a c which is caused again by more confined flow however at sufficiently small gaps between the hull and walls this trend can be inverted this is noticeable in the present results at a higher froude number f r b 4 this effect can be related to longer lengths of side waves produced by the hull and reflected by the channel walls at higher f r b which creates a significant upwash effect near the plate stern this effect is more pronounced for a longer plate with l n b 3 fig 5a but one can also see a saturation of l p b for a shorter plate with l n b 1 in the narrowest channels fig 5c the wetted lengths monotonically increase with decreasing channel width fig 5b d in fig 4b d an expanded view of the plot for the beam based lift coefficient in narrow channels is shown including data from this and previous studies obtained for the two dimensional case of a planing plate i e when w b 1 results adopted from squire 1957 were interpolated between the reported data points so they may have some uncertainties also the lift coefficient used in 2d situations is usually based on the pressure length c l 2 d l 2 d 0 5 ρ u 2 l w this length based 2d lift coefficient was converted here into the beam based values c l l 0 5 ρ u 2 b 2 with a relation between 2d lift and 3d lift per unit span l 2 d l b hence froude numbers and lift coefficients based on the beam in 3d and the wetted length in 2d are related as f r b f r l w l w b and c l c l 2 d l w b respectively as shown in fig 4b d the results obtained with the current method in the 2d formulation mostly match data re calculated from squire 1957 who used the same basic assumptions inviscid flow with gravitational effects only in one case f r b 4 and l n b 1 a modest discrepancy is present that can be caused by our less accurate interpolation of results from squire 1957 at small immersions and large wetted to nominal length ratios the 2d results from green s 1936 paper the so called wagner s solution do not account for gravity and produce higher lift coefficients also show in fig 4b d when plotting wagner s results the wetted lengths obtained with the current 2d model were utilized when converting the 2d length based lift coefficients into the beam based values it can be noted that the 2d lift coefficient increases with increasing froude number in both previous 2d theories and the present 2d model but this behavior becomes opposite in 3d situations with sufficiently wide channels as reflected by both savitsky s correlations and the present 3d model results analyzing the case of very narrow gaps between channel walls and the plate where a transformation of this trend occurs cannot be handled by the current simplified method and will likely require nonlinear theories 4 conclusions a linearized boundary element method based on point sources has been applied for a planing plate in a laterally restricted channel by considering a series of reflected images of the plate converged results are obtained with inclusion of a sufficient number of such images parametric results are presented for the lift slope the center of pressure and the wetted lengths in a range of the channel widths and plate characteristics the lift coefficients and the wetted lengths are found to increase with decreasing channel width whereas the center of pressure initially shifts forward but in very narrow channels it may move aftward obtaining experimental data for planing hulls in narrow channels as well as applying nonlinear theories for this

23617,a problem of a planing surface moving steadily at finite froude numbers in a laterally restricted seaway is considered in this note a linearized potential flow method based on point sources is applied to model hydrodynamics of a planing plate numerical results are obtained and presented for the lift coefficient and the center of pressure the variable parameters include the ratio of the channel width to the plate beam beam based froude number and nominal aspect ratio of the plate a comparison is shown with empirical correlations for unrestricted seaway and with theoretical results for the limiting two dimensional case keywords planing hulls restricted seaway potential flow theory numerical modeling 1 introduction it is well known that restricted seaways can significantly affect hydrodynamics of traditional ship hulls e g tuck 1978 zhou et al 2012 the confined flow phenomena are also important for air supported marine vehicles e g doctors 1993 rozhdestvensky 2000 finite depth effects on planing craft hydrodynamics were discovered and studied in the past as well as recently e g green 1935 morabito 2013 hence it can be also presumed that laterally restricted seaways may have a significant impact on the planing boat performance determining the influence of the channel width on the lift coefficient and the center of pressure of the simplest planing configuration a flat plate is a subject of this communication somewhat related to the present problem are studies of planing catamarans where hydrodynamic interactions between demi hulls are found to modify hydrodynamic properties of each demi hull e g savitsky and dingee 1954 bari and matveev 2016 a linearized potential flow method is applied in this work to model steady hydrodynamics of a planing plate in a channel three dimensional planing surfaces in unrestricted seaway were previously analyzed with related linearized potential flow approaches wang and rispin 1971 derived an analytical solution for a plate planing at high but finite froude numbers doctors 1974 1975 and wellicome and jahangeer 1979 employed a distribution of pressure elements on planing surfaces cheng and wellicome 1994 developed a pressure strip method for planing hulls to achieve better numerical convergence xie at al 2005 and wang and day 2007 gave further recommendations on how to avoid numerical instabilities in the pressure element methods in the present study a distribution of point hydrodynamic sources placed on the boundaries of the water domain is utilized the numerical model is built upon our previous modeling efforts that addressed various configurations of planing hulls e g matveev and ockfen 2009 bari and matveev 2016 developed cavitating flows matveev and miller 2011 and air supported marine craft matveev 2014 2 mathematical model a general schematic for the numerical model is given in fig 1 a flat plate with trim angle α is steadily planing on a water surface in a deep infinitely long channel parallel to the channel walls the water flow is considered to be inviscid and irrotational at the channel boundaries z w 2 the flow velocity normal to the walls must be zero to satisfy this condition an equivalent problem of an infinite series of identical plates planing parallel to each other can be analyzed instead of a single channel with rigid walls a fragment of such a setup is shown in fig 1c the numerical domain also has upstream and downstream boundaries whose dimensions are discussed below in this communication only a brief outline of the mathematical model is given focusing on specifics of treating an infinite series of flow strips for other modeling details one can refer to our previous publications e g matveev and ockfen 2009 matveev 2014 bari and matveev 2016 the trim angle of the hull and the water surface slopes are assumed to be small so velocities of the disturbed flow caused by the presence of the plate are much smaller than the incident flow velocity u with respect to the plate then the problem can be linearized so that bernoulli equation on the water surface can be presented in a linear non dimensional form as follows 1 1 2 c p u u 2 π y w λ 0 where c p p p 0 ρ u 2 2 is the pressure coefficient zero on the free water surface p and p 0 are the pressure on the water surface and above the free surface respectively ρ is the water density u is the x component of the velocity perturbation y w is the water surface elevation λ 2 π u 2 g is the wavelength on the unconstrained free water surface and g is the gravity constant the flow disturbance under consideration can be modeled by a distribution of standard hydrodynamic sources placed on the water surface fig 1a and b a velocity potential of each source satisfies the laplace equation in the water domain the collocation points where eq 1 is fulfilled are shifted upstream from the sources this staggered arrangement removes the wave reflection from the downstream boundary of a numerical domain and ensures the radiation condition bertram 2000 due to symmetry in this problem with respect to x y plane and an infinite number of identical parallel flow strips associated with each planing plate the x component of the velocity perturbation in the starboard part of the central strip 0 z w 2 can be computed as follows 2 u x i c z i c 1 4 π j q j x i c x j s k 1 r i j k 3 1 r i j k 3 where x i c z i c and x j s z j s are the coordinates of the collocation point i and the source j with intensity q j located in the starboard part of the central strip and r i j k x i c x j s 2 z i c z j s k w 2 and r i j k x i c x j s 2 z i c z j s k w 2 are the distances between the considered collocation point and all the sources in all strips due to linearization the vertical distances of the sources and collocation points from the undisturbed water level are ignored in the expressions for distances the infinite summation in eq 2 accounts for the identical strips shifted along z axis by the integer number of the channel widths k w in the numerical implementation however one has to use a finite number of strips n so k n n determining the adequate quantity of strips that must be included to achieve results almost the same as those with the infinite number of strips is demonstrated in the next results section equation 1 represents the dynamic boundary condition for the present problem the linearized kinematic boundary condition on the water surface follows from a relation between the source strengths and the local water surface slope e g matveev 2014 3 1 2 q i 1 δ x i 1 δ z i 1 q i δ x i δ z i 2 u y i s y i 1 s x i s x i 1 s where q i 1 and q i are the source strengths of the upstream and downstream neighbors of the collocation point i and δ x and δ z are the intervals between the source locations in x and z directions on the wetted hull surface the source intensities can be immediately found from the given trim angle of the planing plate thus the linear system of equations eqs 1 3 can be formed the unknowns include water surface elevations outside the plate pressure coefficients on the plate source intensities and velocity perturbations the lift force on the hull and the center of pressure are found by simply integrating the obtained pressure distribution on the plate wetted surface the position of the center of pressure l p is measured from the transom and the lift coefficient c l is based on the plate beam 4 c l c p δ x δ z b 2 where the summation is carried out over the wetted plate area the current method allows us to evaluate the lift induced drag for a flat plate it is equal to the lift multiplied by the trim angle other drag components due to viscous effects cannot be directly obtained with the present inviscid model one of the specific features in the planing hydrodynamics is the initially unknown wetted areas of the planing surfaces since the water tends to rise in front of them fig 1a the water jet that appears above the water impingement point on the plate is neglected similar to riabouchinsky model applied for flows with developed cavitation e g matveev and ockfen 2009 the spray at the side edges of the plate is also ignored in the linear theory an iterative solution procedure is used to determine the final span dependent wetted length of the plate l w as it is not exactly known in the beginning since the spray is neglected the wetted length here represents the loaded length of the pressure zone on the plate an initial guess for the wetted length can be taken as the nominal wetted length l n defined as the distance between the plate stern and an intersection of the undisturbed water level and the hull plate surface fig 1a extensive validation studies of the present method have been carried out previously for 2d and 3d planing hulls including catamaran setups water surface profiles air cushion setups and underwater air cavities matveev and ockfen 2009 matveev and miller 2011 matveev 2014 bari and matveev 2016 additionally a comparison of the model results with empirical correlations of savitsky 1964 is shown in the next section no test data have been found in the literature for planing hulls operating in narrow channels the mesh independence studies conducted in this study with the plate planing in a channel gave the following recommendations to achieve converged results the mesh cell size a distance between sources should be chosen as at least b 6 with b being the plate beam and the upstream and downstream boundaries of the numerical domain need to be positioned at the distances 6 b and 10 b from the plate leading and trailing edges respectively as an example fig 2 illustrates the dependence of c l and l p on the total number of sources n in a fixed domain for the case of l n b 1 f r b u g b 2 and w b 2 the spacing between sources b 6 chosen for the following parametric calculations corresponds to the number of sources of about n 420 in this figure where convergence is clearly achieved 3 results one of the important questions in the present numerical model is the adequate selection of the number of parallel flow strips calculations have been carried out for different numbers of strips considering the following operating conditions for the planing plate l n b 3 f r b u g b 2 and w b 1 5 results for the lift slope and the center of pressure are given in fig 3 one can see that values of c l and l p saturate when the number of strips n becomes sufficiently high for subsequent calculations n 8 has been adopted to adequately represent the influence of the channel walls parametric calculations have been conducted in this study for two froude numbers f r b 2 and 4 plate nominal aspect ratios l n b 3 and 1 and a range of ratios of the channel width to the plate beam w b from 1 2 to 8 in very wide channels results become insensitive to the channel width whereas in very narrow channels with widths only slightly greater than the plate beam viscous and nonlinear effects are likely to be important which are beyond capabilities of the present mathematical model calculated results for the lift slope of the beam based lift coefficient the center of pressure and the mean wetted lengths are shown in figs 4 and 5 for illustration predictions by savitsky s empirical correlations for unrestricted seaway are also given by horizontal lines savitsky 1964 one can see that numerical results for a restricted problem approach savitsky s values in wide channels it should be noted that the exact agreement cannot be expected since simple correlations of savitsky can describe hydrodynamic characteristics only approximately in a broad range of boat parameters and speed regimes the numerical results indicate that the lift coefficient increases with a reduction of the channel width fig 4 this is caused by more confined flow at smaller channel widths so the flow starts transitioning toward a two dimensional pattern which produces higher lift force this effect is somewhat similar to hydrodynamic interactions between hulls in catamaran settings savitsky and dingee 1954 bari and matveev 2016 results show that nearly two fold increase of lift is possible in realistic narrow channels w b 1 5 also the lift coefficients of 3d plates are higher at smaller froude numbers stronger hydrostatic effect and longer hulls larger loaded areas these results are again consistent with savitsky s correlations in the studied range of parameters the centers of pressure generally demonstrate an increasing trend though more modest in magnitude with a decrease of the channel width fig 5a c which is caused again by more confined flow however at sufficiently small gaps between the hull and walls this trend can be inverted this is noticeable in the present results at a higher froude number f r b 4 this effect can be related to longer lengths of side waves produced by the hull and reflected by the channel walls at higher f r b which creates a significant upwash effect near the plate stern this effect is more pronounced for a longer plate with l n b 3 fig 5a but one can also see a saturation of l p b for a shorter plate with l n b 1 in the narrowest channels fig 5c the wetted lengths monotonically increase with decreasing channel width fig 5b d in fig 4b d an expanded view of the plot for the beam based lift coefficient in narrow channels is shown including data from this and previous studies obtained for the two dimensional case of a planing plate i e when w b 1 results adopted from squire 1957 were interpolated between the reported data points so they may have some uncertainties also the lift coefficient used in 2d situations is usually based on the pressure length c l 2 d l 2 d 0 5 ρ u 2 l w this length based 2d lift coefficient was converted here into the beam based values c l l 0 5 ρ u 2 b 2 with a relation between 2d lift and 3d lift per unit span l 2 d l b hence froude numbers and lift coefficients based on the beam in 3d and the wetted length in 2d are related as f r b f r l w l w b and c l c l 2 d l w b respectively as shown in fig 4b d the results obtained with the current method in the 2d formulation mostly match data re calculated from squire 1957 who used the same basic assumptions inviscid flow with gravitational effects only in one case f r b 4 and l n b 1 a modest discrepancy is present that can be caused by our less accurate interpolation of results from squire 1957 at small immersions and large wetted to nominal length ratios the 2d results from green s 1936 paper the so called wagner s solution do not account for gravity and produce higher lift coefficients also show in fig 4b d when plotting wagner s results the wetted lengths obtained with the current 2d model were utilized when converting the 2d length based lift coefficients into the beam based values it can be noted that the 2d lift coefficient increases with increasing froude number in both previous 2d theories and the present 2d model but this behavior becomes opposite in 3d situations with sufficiently wide channels as reflected by both savitsky s correlations and the present 3d model results analyzing the case of very narrow gaps between channel walls and the plate where a transformation of this trend occurs cannot be handled by the current simplified method and will likely

23618,for target search and tracking in unknown underwater environment an integrated algorithm for a cooperative team of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles multi auv is proposed by combining the glasius bio inspired neural network gbnn and bio inspired cascaded tracking control approach to improve search efficiency and reduce tracking errors among them the gbnn is mainly used to control a multi auv team in search of each targets once any target is found the bio inspired cascaded tracking control approach is applied to track it in case that it may escape this integrated algorithm deals with various situations such as search for static or dynamic targets and tracking of different trajectory in underwater environments with obstacles the simulation results show that this integrated algorithm is of high efficiency and adaptability keywords multiple autonomous underwater vehicles multi auv cooperative target search tracking control glasius bio inspired neural network gbnn bio inspired cascaded 1 introduction autonomous underwater vehicle auv is an important tool for marine resource exploitation and marine scientific research paull et al 2014 chu and zhang 2014 kulkarni and pompili 2010 due to the limited energy communication range bandwidth and sensing range of the auvs many applications has outgrown single auv s capability therefore multi auv systems with high parallelism robustness and collaboration have gradually become a new research field millan et al 2014 cai 2013 yang and li 2011 the fundamental research of a multi auv system is how to search and track target in unknown underwater environments cai 2013 yang and li 2011 masehian and nejad 2010 as more and more research interests turn to the cooperative target search some significant achievements have been obtained in this field for example yoon and qiao 2011 proposed a synchronization based survey algorithm to conduct a multi auv team with limited energy and communication capabilities this approach enables the work team to search large areas even with mechanical failures of some team members in order to improve the search efficiency couillard et al couillard et al 2012 developed a local sequential path planning algorithm and a more global simulated annealing algorithm allowing a multi auv team to search for more than one targets while minimizing the total distance covered li and landa silva 2011 for target search tasks particle swarm optimization pso algorithm is also demonstrated to be effective cao et al cao et al 2015 proposed an improved pso algorithm for path planning and search tasks this algorithm is expected to show fast convergence and global search characters in addition furukawa et al lanillos et al 2014 presented a coordinated control technique that allows heterogeneous vehicles to autonomously search for and track multiple targets using recursive bayesian filtering a unified sensor model and a unified objective function are proposed to enable search and tracking within the recursive bayesian filter framework cai et al 2011 proposed a hierarchical reinforcement learning based approach to fulfil target search tasks in complex environments though these algorithms with some cooperation rules can handle the target search tasks the learning process is essential before the work cao et al cao et al 2016 presented a decentralized search algorithm based on bio inspired neurodynamics model in 3 d underwater environments with obstacles this neuron network algorithm not only enables the multi auv team to fulfill its search task when there isn t any mechanical breakdown with its team members but also ensures a successful search if one or several auvs fail the multi auv system however has a problem of optimization that is it is expected to accomplish the task in an optimal or nearly optimal way although some algorithms have been developed for optimization with current researches there are some common problems with them as follows 1 when the environment is unknown to a multi auv system it is not easy to offer an explicit model of the environment and thus the approach for target search is heuristic in that case the multi auv system if possible should be supposed to be able to learn with real time information of its surroundings 2 learning process or training process is usually indispensable to gain optimal results in real applications such a process is unrealistic the approach of this thesis provides with some intelligent search rules based on the experience or common knowledge 3 when the multi auv system faces up a dynamic environment some common optimal approaches cannot work efficiently such as the evolution algorithm due to the uncertainty of the environment the converge speed is usually unsatisfied 4 most of the current research achievements focus on fixed situations the existing approaches can deal with some certain conditions but lack the flexibility to handle with different conditional variables for example different numbers of auvs involved or different initial positions of the searchers targets furthermore an auv system needs not only search but also tracking of the targets in case of their escape some significant achievements have been obtained in target tracking for example sliding mode method rong jong 2007 sankaranarayanan and mahindrakar 2009 sun et al 2014 defoort et al 2008 soylu et al 2008 is usually used for dynamic tracking control for the outstanding characteristic including insensitivity to parameter variations and good rejection of disturbances and sliding mode control is extraordinary suitable for robust tracking control of underwater vehicles however one major drawback of the sliding mode approach is the high frequency of control action chattering this high frequency control activity causes high heat losses in electrical power circuits and premature wear in actuators in addition the high control activity may excite unmodelled high frequency dynamics which in turn causes controller performance degradation to eliminate or reduce chattering various methods have been proposed to reach a continuous robust control such as chattering free sliding mode control method with an adaptive estimate term by s serdar soylu et al 2008 the backstepping control algorithms lapierre and jouvencel 2008 kaddissi et al 2007 tsai and song 2009 fierro and lewis 1997 is the most commonly used approach for mobile robot tracking control and has been adopted in underwater vehicle control systems it is quite simple and the system stability can be strictly guaranteed by lyapunov stability theory even with arbitrarily large initial state errors however the disadvantage for backstepping method is quite obvious the velocity control law is directly related to the state errors so large sharp speed jump occurs while sudden tracking error happens it means that the required acceleration and forces moments exceed their control constraint at the velocity jump points which is practically impossible to resolve the impractical speed jump problem of large initial velocities resulted from the backstepping technique some fuzzy control methods jeen shing and lee 2003 ishaque et al 2011 antonelli et al 2007 and neural network control algorithms li et al 2004 kodogiannis 2006 are proposed the fuzzy rules based tracking control approaches can solve the problem of large speed jump but it is very difficult to formulate the fuzzy rules which are usually obtained by trial and error based human knowledge one major advantage of neural networks is that the dynamics of the controlled system need not to be completely known this character makes it very suitable for underwater vehicle control for example a neural network adaptive controller is proposed by li li et al 2004 for autonomous diving control of an auv using adaptive backstepping method when the smooth unknown dynamics of a vehicle is approximated by a neural network anyhow the existing neural networks based tracking control algorithms for underwater vehicle require either on line learning or off line training procedures which could be computational complicated kodogiannis 2006 and no formal mathematical characterization exists for the closed loop system behavior to combine target search and tracking in unknown underwater environments with obstacles this paper proposes an integrated algorithm based on glasius bio inspired neural network gbnn and bio inspired cascaded tracking control approach its working process involves three phases as shown in fig 1 the first is to apply the gbnn to auvs search multiple targets in unknown underwater environment a topologically organized bio inspired neurodynamics model is constructed to represent the dynamic environment the target globally attracts the auv through the dynamic neural activity landscape of the model while the obstacles locally push the auv away to avoid collision the auv generates its search path to the targets autonomously by a steepest gradient descent rule then if any auv finds a dynamic target the bio inspired cascaded tracking control approach is applied to track it lastly when all the targets are detected the search and track task complete the advantages of this approach can be summarized as follows 1 this approach is a combination of two methods and thus gives a full play to the merits of both for an integrated searching and tracking process 2 when the gbnn algorithm deals with different situations it doesn t need a large number of function evaluations and parameter a b d μ and r adjustments to work for the real time cooperative searching and tracking the proposed approach can be extended to real world applications easily 3 due to the shunting characteristics of bio inspired model the proposed approach can solve the speed jump problem and promise each thruster within the saturation limit in the process of target tracking the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section ii the basic kinematics and dynamics of the auv is given section iii presents the gbnn and bio inspired cascaded tracking control approach the simulation experiments for various situations are given in section iv and finally the conclusion is given in section v 2 auv models 2 1 kinematic model in a three dimensional 3 d cartesian workspace shown in fig 2 two coordinate frame systems are defined the inertial frame system o x y z and the body fixed frame system o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 the coordinate systems illustrated in fig 3 obey the right hand rule and the z axis points to the downward the kinematic models are formulated as below let η x y z ϕ θ ψ t be the generalized coordinates representing the position x y z and the orientation ϕ θ ψ with respect to the inertial frame and q u v w p q r t be the translational velocities u v w and the rotational velocities p q r with respect to the body frame attached at the vehicle then the kinematic model relating the body fixed frame to the inertial frame can be expressed in a compact vector form as follows antonelli et al 2007 1 η j η q η 1 η 2 j 1 η 2 0 3 3 0 3 3 j 1 η 2 q 1 q 2 where η 1 x y z t η 2 ϕ θ ψ t q q 1 t q 2 t t q 1 u v w t

sea bottom with complex terrain when it moves to resist the ocean current in deep sea the auv s motion status will be in large drift angles when it is required to move at a low forward rotational speed the nonlinear characteristics is strong with maneuverability hydrodynamic forces of the auv it is necessary to make special mathematical model for some situations the final form of the dynamic

gbnn gbnn algorithm in this paper is a kind of discrete hopfield type neural network firstly the glasius bioinspired neural network is built according to the underwater workspace shown as in fig 3 in this model each individual neuron is connected with the adjacent ones to form a network for their transmission of activity in the proposed model the excitatory input results from the target and the lateral neural connections while the inhibitory input results from the obstacles only each neuron has local lateral connections to its neighboring neurons the neuron responds only to the stimulus within its receptive field in the proposed model the collision free auv motion is planned in real time based on the dynamic activity landscape of the neural network the dynamics of this discrete time

transfer function g may be any monotonically increasing function glasius et al 1996 luo and yang 2008 a piecewise linear function is selected as the transfer function as follows 14 g x 0 x 0 β x x 0 1 1 x 1 where β 0 is a positive constant the proposed network characterized by equation 11 guarantees that the positive neural activity is able to be propagated to all the state space but the negative activity only stays locally therefore the target globally attracts the auv while the obstacles only locally avoid the collision the activity landscape of the neural network dynamically changes due to the varying external inputs from the targets and obstacles and the internal activity propagation among neurons the optimal auv path is planned from the dynamic activity landscape and the previous auv location the auv will move to the neuron with maximal neural activity after the current location reaches its next location the next location becomes a new current location the current auv location adaptively changes according to the varying environment the activity landscape of the neural network dynamically changes due to the varying external inputs from the target and obstacles and the internal activity propagation among neurons for energy and time efficiency the auv should travel a shortest path and make least turning of moving directions for a given current auv location denoted by l c the next auv location l n is obtained by luo et al 2014b yang and luo 2004 15 l n arg max m n x m n n s m n where s is the number of neighboring neurons of the l c th neuron s 8 i e all the possible next locations of the current location l c variable x m n is the neural activity of the l th neuron in the search task the neural activity landscape will never reach a steady state as in 2 d environments each auv keeps moving toward the neuron location with the maximum activity in the detection region in the proposed model due to the very large external input constant e the target and obstacles keep staying at the peak and valley of the activity landscape of the neural network respectively thus auvs should be able to search the target efficiently with obstacle avoidance before their search tasks are finished at the same time each auv searches in different direction so as not to cause conflict in this way the multi auv team can realize cooperation in an efficient way 3 2 the bio inspired cascaded tracking control approach in order to prevent dynamic targets from escaping auv team member needs to track each of them ever since it is detected this needs a precise tracking control considering that the auv s major movement is in three degrees of freedom dof surge sway yaw so in this paper only the three dof tracking control problem is presented the controller design problem can be described as follows the desired state of auv is defined as 16 η d x d y d ψ d t where η d x d y d ψ d t is the desired state of auv in the inertial frame x d y d is coordinate of desired path in global cartesian workspace the inertial frame ψ is the counter clockwise rotation angle of auv the desired forward and angular velocities can be deduced by 17 u d x d cos ψ d y d sin ψ d v d x d sin ψ d y d cos ψ d r d ψ d x d y d x d y d x d 2 y d 2 the actual state of auv is represented by η x y ψ t q u v r t as the objective of the path tracking controllers is to make auv follow the known path by controlling the velocity and angular velocities so the tracking error e x x d x e y y d y e ψ ψ d ψ converges to zero here e η d η e x e y e ψ t is the tracking error in the inertial frame in the body fixed frame the tracking error is e u cos ψ e x sin ψ e y e v sin ψ e x cos ψ e y e r e ψ a detailed model of tracking control problem is given in fig 4 the basic control architecture of the system is illustrated in fig 5 the design of the cascaded control strategy consists of two parts 1 an outer loop auxiliary velocity controller by using position and orientation state errors 2 an inner loop sliding mode controller by using velocity state vector an auxiliary velocity control inputs are generated by a novel velocity controller based on bio inspired model the bio inspired model is used to guarantee the position error asymptotically stable and eliminate or inhibit the sharp speed jumps of the velocity commonly existing in backstepping method due to the tracking errors changing suddenly then a sliding mode controller is used to generate the control forces torques which is designed to drive the auv and make the linear and angular velocities of the auv converge to the reference velocities 3 2 1 backstepping velocity controller backstepping method for nonholonomic mobile auv has been designed for velocity tracking sankaranarayanan and mahindrakar 2009 sun et al 2014 but the auv in this study is a holonomic system so the backstepping control law for the mobile auv is not fit for this control system for this reason a new backstepping control law is designed for auv and makes it possible to follow a given reference posture with stability one thing that needed to be stated is that the backstepping method in this paper is only concerned about the kinematic control the auxiliary velocity controller based on the backstepping approach can be designed as 18 q c u c v c r c k e x cos ψ e y sin ψ u d cos e ψ v d sin e ψ k e x sin ψ e y cos ψ u d sin e ψ v d cos e ψ r d k ψ e ψ where k k ψ are constant coefficients q d u d v d r d t is the desired velocity in the body fixed frame u d cos e ψ v d sin e ψ u d sin e ψ v d cos e ψ represents the desired velocity frame transformed to the actual velocity frame seen in fig 4 by analyzing the performance of the traditional backstepping velocity controller this controller occurs the sharp speed jumps when tracking errors change suddenly it means that the required acceleration and forces torques are very large even infinite which may exceed vehicle s control constraint and it is usually practically impossible however the biological neural model is of the characteristics such as stability bounded activity and smooth response it may be used to produce a bounded and smooth auxiliary signal related to tracking errors to improve the real time velocity commands so we add bio inspired neurons dynamics model to velocity controller 3 2 2 bio inspired velocity controller bio inspired neural dynamics model was first developed by grossberg it can describe an on line adaptive behavior of individuals it was originally derived based on the membrane model proposed by hodgkin and huxley for a patch of membrane using electrical elements the dynamics of voltage across the membrane v m can be described in the membrane model using state equation technique as 19 c m d v m d t e p v m g p e n a v m g n a e k v m g k where c m is the membrane capacitance the parameters e k e n a and e p are the nernst potentials for potassium ions sodium ions and passive leak current in the membrane respectively g k g p and g n a are the conductance of potassium sodium and the passive channels are functions of input signals that vary with time to simplify the equation a shunting equation is obtained as 20 v a v b v s t d v s t where v is the neural activity membrane potential of the neuron parameters a b and d are respectively the passive decay rate the upper and lower bounds of the neural activity the variables s and s represent the excitatory and inhibitory input respectively the shunting dynamic of an individual neuron can be modeled by this equation the neutron dynamics are restricted to a bounded interval d b and an automatic gain control so we can infer the shunting equation to the following form 21 v i a v i b v i f e i d v i g e i where f e i max e i 0 g e i max e i 0 a b d are positive constants for a system with appropriate chosen inputs various desirable functional properties such as competitive short memory upper bound and lower bound can be derived from the model the bio inspired model is a continuous differential equation and can also be regarded as a low pass filter the systems output v is guaranteed to stay in a region d b for any excitatory and inhibitory inputs several advantages such as the guaranteed stability and efficient computation are provided by the model for the auv tracking control in this paper the tracking errors e η d η in the inertial frame are chosen as the inputs of the bio inspired model while the outputs v i i x y ψ will replace the tracking errors e in 18 so the proposed auxiliary velocity controller can be written as 22 q c u c v c r c k v x cos ψ v y sin ψ u d cos e ψ v d sin e ψ k v x sin ψ v y cos ψ u d sin e ψ v d cos e ψ r d k ψ v ψ where k k ψ are the same parameters of 18 due to the shunting characteristics of bio inspired model the output of the bio inspired model is bounded in a finite interval and smooth without any sharp jumps when inputs have sudden changes so the controller performance is significantly improved 3 2 3 the adaptive sliding mode controller in the normal way if only the kinematic model is considered the tracking control design is complete however perfect velocity tracking is assumed to be hold in the kinematic control which is unrealistic in practice in this section the kinematic control is extended to the dynamic case the suitable forces moments to drive the vehicle tracking a given reference vehicle are then derived from the velocity control input we address the problem where parametric uncertainties exist in the dynamics of the follower subjected to unknown ocean disturbances in this case an adaptive sliding mode controller is proposed to deal with the challenging problem as a rule sliding mode control can be divided into two parts first define a sliding manifold s second find a control law to move toward the sliding manifold define an auxiliary velocity error 23 e c q c q then the sliding manifold is defined as 24 s e c 2 λ e c λ 2 e c λ represents a strictly positive constant s is a 2 1 vector derivation of 24 then 25 s e c 2 λ e c λ 2 e c e c 2 λ q c q λ 2 e c when the system is operating on the sliding surface 25 equals zero i e 26 s e c 2 λ e c λ 2 e c e c 2 λ q c q λ 2 e c 0 substituting 9 into 26 then 27 e c 2 λ q c m 1 τ cq dq g λ 2 e 0 so the equivalent control law can be concluded as 28 τ e q m ˆ q c e c 2 λ λ 2 e c c ˆ q d ˆ q g ˆ where m ˆ c ˆ d ˆ g ˆ are estimated terms considering the difficulty of computing e c in 28 a feedback control input of acceleration error is introduced 29 e c k e c where k is a constant scalar representing the strictly positive constant that determines the rate of acceleration error the conventional sliding mode can be designed as 30 τ τ e q k sgn s to eliminate chattering problem caused by the discontinuous term an adaptive term rong jong 2007 is added in the control law to replace the switching term 31 τ a d τ e s t k c ˆ 2 λ s where τ e s t is an adaptive term that estimates the lumped uncertainty vector defined in 10 k is also a constant scalar representing the strictly positive constant related to the convergence rate of the controller the estimation of the lumped uncertainty vector is proposed to follow 32 τ e s t γ s where γ represent the strictly positive constant that determines the rate of adaption the total control law can be defined as 33 τ τ e q τ a d τ e q τ e s t k c ˆ 2 λ s 4 simulation studies in simulations a tritech mk2 sonar is mounted on the auv for target search and tracking the sonar is a mechanical scanning one which continuously rotates the transducer to sends a narrow fan shaped acoustic beam to scan a full 360 sector the surrounding environments the operating frequency of the sonar is 700 khz the vertical and horizontal beam widths are 30 and 3 respectively the maximum range is up to 100 m auvs and their targets are allowed to move within the given space when one target moves into any auv s sensing range this target is regarded as being detected if there is a dynamic target it is then followed and tracked after all targets within the given space have been found the search task ends simulation experiments conducted are coded in matlab including different cases of search for static or dynamic targets and tracking with different paths 4 1 target search 4 1 1 static targets search to test the basic performance of the proposed algorithm the first simulation is conducted for static targets this simulation involves three targets three auvs and several obstacles in unknown underwater environments whose initial positions are distributed as shown in fig 6 a at the beginning of the search task since the target will impact the entire search area through neural transmission the activity of each neuron can be derived from the shunting equation 11 when an auv makes a selection of its path it compares the activity value of the neuron of its current location with its neighbors and chooses the one with the highest value as the next step in the gbnn the targets and obstacles are respectively excitation and inhibitory of the neural network by repeating this performance auvs keep moving towards their targets and are able to round obstacles to avoid collision as shown in fig 6 b static target t1 t2 and t3 are found by auv r3 r2 and r1 respectively this shows that the proposed algorithm realizes a joint search for multiple static targets in case auvs are outnumbered by their targets the approach works as well as shown in fig 7 there are six targets and four auvs target t1 is found by auv r3 target t2 and t3 by auv r2 target t4 and t5 by auv r1 and target t6 by auv r1 therefore the proposed algorithm can achieve search task with different number of auvs and targets 4 1 2 dynamic targets search the second simulation is conducted to test search for multiple dynamic targets which will undoubtedly cause more difficulties but the proposed algorithm in this paper exactly overcomes this difficulty due to the pre definition the activity values of the neurons in the targets are positive and the target globally attracts auvs through the dynamic neural activity landscape of the model according to equation 11 activity values of auv s neighbor neurons will change accordingly when the target s location changes through the change of activity values of neighboring neurons the real time information about the ever changing locations of the mobile target can be obtained by each auv the proposed algorithm can constantly adjust search paths according to changes of the neighboring neural activity value fig 8 clearly shows this process of three auvs search for three dynamic targets among them the targets move at random and auvs move according to principles of the gbnn fig 8 a presents the initial positions of auvs targets and obstacles as shown in fig 8 b dynamic targets t1 t2 and t3 are found by auv r3 r2 and r1 respectively obviously the simulation result shows that the proposed algorithm realizes a joint search for multiple dynamic targets if the initial positions of auvs are in the center of the workspace as shown in fig 9 a the performance of the gbnn is given as follows 4 1 3 dynamic obstacles the gbnn algorithm can avoid not only static obstacles but also dynamic ones in fig 10 a o1 is a dynamic obstacle the speed of o1 is lower than that of the auvs at the first beginning auv r1 r2 and r3 are able to head northwest without any obstacles in their way however when o1 the obstacle moves into the way of r1 a collision is inevitable if r1 keeps moving along its pre determined trajectory to solve this problem the gbnn adjusts the activity values of r1 s neighbor neurons i e it s next moving direction according to real time changes in environmental information and thus make it possible for r1 to change its moving directions to avoid o1 likewise it happens to r2 when it is traversed by o1 by re planning a collision free path the gbnn proves to be effective to avoid dynamic obstacles during the search process shown as in fig 10 b 4 1 4 comparison of different algorithms in order to further validate the performance of the proposed algorithm comparison studies with the potential field based particle swarm optimization ppso algorithm will be carried out the potential field is implemented in the fitness function of the particle swarm optimization pso which provides with reasonable evaluations of the underwater environments the pso algorithm plans a path by iteratively improving a candidate solution with regard to the fitness function cao et al 2015 the comparison studies involve three dynamic targets three auvs and some obstacles with environments scale of 40 40 two algorithms are applied to the multi auvs that are directed to search all the targets in these conditions two algorithms respectively complete 50 times simulation experiments of target searching in each simulation experiment the initial positions of the auvs and the targets being searched for as well as the location of obstacles are all randomly distributed to make a clear distinction between the two algorithms table 1 lists the mean and standard deviation statistics of path length time of complete the task energy consumption by both algorithms it is reasonable to conclude that the integrated algorithm of gbnn performs better than the ppso in each item of simulation results hence it distinguishes itself with the shorter path length and time and lower energy consumption 4 2 tracking control for dynamic targets tracking is necessary after they are detected for fear of their escape considering that the auv s major movement is in three degrees of freedom dof surge sway yaw so in this simulation only the three dof tracking control problem is presented due to this paper focuses on whether each auv detector can track its prey target as intended and whether the tracking error is within the expected range and the limited length of this paper the targets motion trajectories are assumed to be known in advance without regard to their generation in this section curve path tracking and circular path tracking are simulated 4 2 1 curve path tracking assuming that the motion trajectory of dynamic target t2 is a curve and its initial posture is 0 2 0 0 while the initial posture of auv r2 is 0 3 0 0 we get an initial posture error 0 1 0 0 time varies from 0 to 30s assume the desired track state of auv r2 is x d t 0 03 t 0 2 y d t 0 03 t ψ d π 4 to reflect uncertainties of the vehicle dynamics 20 model inaccuracies error were incorporated into the controller s dynamic model the parameter setting of the cascaded controller is shown in table 2 the simulation process in this paper can be described as follows for the bio inspired cascaded tracking control model the auxiliary velocity controller q c can be calculated by 22 then the control forces and moments τ τ x τ y τ n t can be generated by the sliding mode controller 32 using the auxiliary velocity controller q c and next the control forces and moments τ will be applied to the auv models to produce the actual velocity in surge sway yaw q u v r t respectively finally it will be easy to get the actual underwater vehicle s states η x y ψ t by η j q fig 11 shows the simulation results of the curve tracking the yellow solid line in the zoom in indicates the motion trajectory of dynamic target t2 and the blue solid line the tracking trajectory of auv r2 in fig 11 the bio inspired cascaded tracking control method can catch up and land on the desired path smoothly with a quick response for which a reasonable explanation can be found in auxiliary velocity response in fig 12 being a velocity controller the bio inspired model is confined in the range of d b with its output due to the shunting characteristics as seen in fig 12 the auxiliary velocity terms with the bio inspired model are smooth without any sharp jumps and all the control variables are limited in the saturation point to make an in depth analysis of these simulation results the tracking errors of curve path are shown in fig 13 as we can see the tracking error of x direction becomes 0 in 2 s while that of y direction becomes 0 in 5 s at the same time the tracking error of x direction can be limited in the range of 0 1 0 1 while that of y direction in the range of 0 007 0 007 in brief it can be concluded that the proposed bio inspired tracking control method is practical and effective 4 2 2 circular path tracking another typical case of tracking method is circular path tracking for instance auv r3 starts at posture 0 5 0 5 0 and the target t4 at 0 5 0 9 0 with an initial posture error is 0 0 4 0 time varies from 0 to 200s the desired track state of auv r3 is x d t sin 0 5 t y d t cos 0 5 t ψ d t 0 5 t the parameter setting of the hybrid controller is shown in table 3 the other settings are the same as those in curve path simulation fig 14 shows the simulation results of the circular tracking with which the yellow solid line in the zoom in indicates the tracking trajectory of dynamic target t4 and the blue solid line of auv r3 with a comparison similar results to the curve path tracking are obtained in this simulation experiment in the simulation results of trajectory tracking in fig 14 the bio inspired cascaded tracking control method can drive to reach and stay on the trajectory in quick response and can drive in a satisfactory way fig 15 shows the auxiliary velocity of the bio inspired tracking control method with this method none of the control value exceeds their maximum control values and all of the control forces are restricted below the propeller s control saturation point this proves the efficiency of the proposed cascaded tracking method in depth analysis of these simulation results fig 16 shows the tracking error of curve path as can be seen from the fig 16 the tracking error of x direction becomes 0 after 1 s the tracking error of y direction becomes to 0 after 1 s and the tracking error of θ becomes to 0 after 1 5 s at the same time the tracking error of x direction can be limited in the range of 0 7 0 7 and the tracking error of y direction can be limited in the range of 0 5 0 5 and the tracking error of θ can be limited in the range of 0 05 0 05 in brief it can be concluded that the proposed bio inspired tracking control method is practical and effective 5 conclusion in this paper a gbnn and bio inspired cascaded tracking control approach are integrated to realize cooperative search and tracking for static as well as dynamic targets in unknown underwater environments with obstacles on the one hand it makes full use of the advantages of gbnn with which no information about the workspace or pre learning is needed and few parameter adjustments would be made on the other hand the application of bio inspired cascaded tracking control model in the velocity controller can solve the speed jump problem and promise each propeller within its saturation limit with simulation experiments it is shown that the integrated algorithm not only enables the multi auv team to accomplish its search task but also it ensures a successful tracking of dynamic targets despite the advantages of this algorithm some problems are still insufficiently considered for instance factors in real environments like ocean currents are excluded in these simulations therefore further studies are needed for better algorithms that can accord with the real 3 d underwater environments acknowledgment this project is supported by the

23618,for target search and tracking in unknown underwater environment an integrated algorithm for a cooperative team of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles multi auv is proposed by combining the glasius bio inspired neural network gbnn and bio inspired cascaded tracking control approach to improve search efficiency and reduce tracking errors among them the gbnn is mainly used to control a multi auv team in search of each targets once any target is found the bio inspired cascaded tracking control approach is applied to track it in case that it may escape this integrated algorithm deals with various situations such as search for static or dynamic targets and tracking of different trajectory in underwater environments with obstacles the simulation results show that this integrated algorithm is of high efficiency and adaptability keywords multiple autonomous underwater vehicles multi auv cooperative target search tracking control glasius bio inspired neural network gbnn bio inspired cascaded 1 introduction autonomous underwater vehicle auv is an important tool for marine resource exploitation and marine scientific research paull et al 2014 chu and zhang 2014 kulkarni and pompili 2010 due to the limited energy communication range bandwidth and sensing range of the auvs many applications has outgrown single auv s capability therefore multi auv systems with high parallelism robustness and collaboration have gradually become a new research field millan et al 2014 cai 2013 yang and li 2011 the fundamental research of a multi auv system is how to search and track target in unknown underwater environments cai 2013 yang and li 2011 masehian and nejad 2010 as more and more research interests turn to the cooperative target search some significant achievements have been obtained in this field for example yoon and qiao 2011 proposed a synchronization based survey algorithm to conduct a multi auv team with limited energy and communication capabilities this approach enables the work team to search large areas even with mechanical failures of some team members in order to improve the search efficiency couillard et al couillard et al 2012 developed a local sequential path planning algorithm and a more global simulated annealing algorithm allowing a multi auv team to search for more than one targets while minimizing the total distance covered li and landa silva 2011 for target search tasks particle swarm optimization pso algorithm is also demonstrated to be effective cao et al cao et al 2015 proposed an improved pso algorithm for path planning and search tasks this algorithm is expected to show fast convergence and global search characters in addition furukawa et al lanillos et al 2014 presented a coordinated control technique that allows heterogeneous vehicles to autonomously search for and track multiple targets using recursive bayesian filtering a unified sensor model and a unified objective function are proposed to enable search and tracking within the recursive bayesian filter framework cai et al 2011 proposed a hierarchical reinforcement learning based approach to fulfil target search tasks in complex environments though these algorithms with some cooperation rules can handle the target search tasks the learning process is essential before the work cao et al cao et al 2016 presented a decentralized search algorithm based on bio inspired neurodynamics model in 3 d underwater environments with obstacles this neuron network algorithm not only enables the multi auv team to fulfill its search task when there isn t any mechanical breakdown with its team members but also ensures a successful search if one or several auvs fail the multi auv system however has a problem of optimization that is it is expected to accomplish the task in an optimal or nearly optimal way although some algorithms have been developed for optimization with current researches there are some common problems with them as follows 1 when the environment is unknown to a multi auv system it is not easy to offer an explicit model of the environment and thus the approach for target search is heuristic in that case the multi auv system if possible should be supposed to be able to learn with real time information of its surroundings 2 learning process or training process is usually indispensable to gain optimal results in real applications such a process is unrealistic the approach of this thesis provides with some intelligent search rules based on the experience or common knowledge 3 when the multi auv system faces up a dynamic environment some common optimal approaches cannot work efficiently such as the evolution algorithm due to the uncertainty of the environment the converge speed is usually unsatisfied 4 most of the current research achievements focus on fixed situations the existing approaches can deal with some certain conditions but lack the flexibility to handle with different conditional variables for example different numbers of auvs involved or different initial positions of the searchers targets furthermore an auv system needs not only search but also tracking of the targets in case of their escape some significant achievements have been obtained in target tracking for example sliding mode method rong jong 2007 sankaranarayanan and mahindrakar 2009 sun et al 2014 defoort et al 2008 soylu et al 2008 is usually used for dynamic tracking control for the outstanding characteristic including insensitivity to parameter variations and good rejection of disturbances and sliding mode control is extraordinary suitable for robust tracking control of underwater vehicles however one major drawback of the sliding mode approach is the high frequency of control action chattering this high frequency control activity causes high heat losses in electrical power circuits and premature wear in actuators in addition the high control activity may excite unmodelled high frequency dynamics which in turn causes controller performance degradation to eliminate or reduce chattering various methods have been proposed to reach a continuous robust control such as chattering free sliding mode control method with an adaptive estimate term by s serdar soylu et al 2008 the backstepping control algorithms lapierre and jouvencel 2008 kaddissi et al 2007 tsai and song 2009 fierro and lewis 1997 is the most commonly used approach for mobile robot tracking control and has been adopted in underwater vehicle control systems it is quite simple and the system stability can be strictly guaranteed by lyapunov stability theory even with arbitrarily large initial state errors however the disadvantage for backstepping method is quite obvious the velocity control law is directly related to the state errors so large sharp speed jump occurs while sudden tracking error happens it means that the required acceleration and forces moments exceed their control constraint at the velocity jump points which is practically impossible to resolve the impractical speed jump problem of large initial velocities resulted from the backstepping technique some fuzzy control methods jeen shing and lee 2003 ishaque et al 2011 antonelli et al 2007 and neural network control algorithms li et al 2004 kodogiannis 2006 are proposed the fuzzy rules based tracking control approaches can solve the problem of large speed jump but it is very difficult to formulate the fuzzy rules which are usually obtained by trial and error based human knowledge one major advantage of neural networks is that the dynamics of the controlled system need not to be completely known this character makes it very suitable for underwater vehicle control for example a neural network adaptive controller is proposed by li li et al 2004 for autonomous diving control of an auv using adaptive backstepping method when the smooth unknown dynamics of a vehicle is approximated by a neural network anyhow the existing neural networks based tracking control algorithms for underwater vehicle require either on line learning or off line training procedures which could be computational complicated kodogiannis 2006 and no formal mathematical characterization exists for the closed loop system behavior to combine target search and tracking in unknown underwater environments with obstacles this paper proposes an integrated algorithm based on glasius bio inspired neural network gbnn and bio inspired cascaded tracking control approach its working process involves three phases as shown in fig 1 the first is to apply the gbnn to auvs search multiple targets in unknown underwater environment a topologically organized bio inspired neurodynamics model is constructed to represent the dynamic environment the target globally attracts the auv through the dynamic neural activity landscape of the model while the obstacles locally push the auv away to avoid collision the auv generates its search path to the targets autonomously by a steepest gradient descent rule then if any auv finds a dynamic target the bio inspired cascaded tracking control approach is applied to track it lastly when all the targets are detected the search and track task complete the advantages of this approach can be summarized as follows 1 this approach is a combination of two methods and thus gives a full play to the merits of both for an integrated searching and tracking process 2 when the gbnn algorithm deals with different situations it doesn t need a large number of function evaluations and parameter a b d μ and r adjustments to work for the real time cooperative searching and tracking the proposed approach can be extended to real world applications easily 3 due to the shunting characteristics of bio inspired model the proposed approach can solve the speed jump problem and promise each thruster within the saturation limit in the process of target tracking the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section ii the basic kinematics and dynamics of the auv is given section iii presents the gbnn and bio inspired cascaded tracking control approach the simulation experiments for various situations are given in section iv and finally the conclusion is given in section v 2 auv models 2 1 kinematic model in a three dimensional 3 d cartesian workspace shown in fig 2 two coordinate frame systems are defined the inertial frame system o x y z and the body fixed frame system o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 the coordinate systems illustrated in fig 3 obey the right hand rule and the z axis points to the downward the kinematic models are formulated as below let η x y z ϕ θ ψ t be the generalized coordinates representing the position x y z and the orientation ϕ θ ψ with respect to the inertial frame and q u v w p q r t be the translational velocities u v w and the rotational velocities p q r with respect to the body frame attached at the vehicle then the kinematic model relating the body fixed frame to the inertial frame can be expressed in a compact vector form as follows antonelli et al 2007 1 η j η q η 1 η 2 j 1 η 2 0 3 3 0 3 3 j 1 η 2 q 1 q 2 where η 1 x y z t η 2 ϕ θ ψ t q q 1 t q 2 t t q 1 u v w t

sea bottom with complex terrain when it moves to resist the ocean current in deep sea the auv s motion status will be in large drift angles when it is required to move at a low forward rotational speed the nonlinear characteristics is strong with maneuverability hydrodynamic forces of the auv it is necessary to make special mathematical model for some situations the final form of the dynamic equations of general motion of auv with six degrees of freedom dof motion can be expressed as follows xie et al 2009 3 m u v r w q x g q 2 r 2 y g p q r z g p r q t x w b sin θ ρ 2 l 4 x q q q 2 x r r

order to give a more clear explanation for the latter control approach the dynamic equation of auv can be presented as a compact vector form fossen 1994 9 m q c q q d q q g η τ where m r n n inertia matrix including the added mass effects c r n n the matrix of coriolis and centrifugal terms including added mass caused by hydrodynamic effect d r n n the hydrodynamic damping matrix g r n gravity and buoyancy forces τ r n is the control forces and moments acting on the auv centre of mass as mentioned earlier the system dynamics are not exactly known the system dynamics can be divided into two

gbnn gbnn algorithm in this paper is a kind of discrete hopfield type neural network firstly the glasius bioinspired neural network is built according to the underwater workspace shown as in fig 3 in this model each individual neuron is connected with the adjacent ones to form a network for their transmission of activity in the proposed model the excitatory input results from the target and the lateral neural connections while the inhibitory input results from the obstacles only each neuron has local lateral connections to its neighboring neurons the neuron responds only to the stimulus within its receptive field in the proposed model the collision free auv motion is planned in real time based on the dynamic activity landscape of the neural network the dynamics of this discrete time neural network is described as the following equations luo et al 2014a 11 x k t 1 g l s i ω k l x l t i k 12 ω k l e γ k l 2 k l r 0 k l r where ω k l are symmetric connection weights between the k th neuron and the l th neuron k l is the euclidian distance from the k th neuron to the l th neuron g is the transfer function γ and γ 0 are constants the external input i k to the k th neuron is defined as i k e if it is a target i k e if it is an obstacle position i k 0 otherwise where e 1 is a positive constant 13 i i e i f i t i s a t a r g e t e i f i t i s a n o b s t a c l e 0 o t h e r w i s e transfer function g may be any monotonically increasing function glasius et al 1996 luo and yang 2008 a piecewise linear function is selected as the transfer function as follows 14 g x 0 x 0 β x x 0 1 1 x 1 where β 0 is a positive constant the proposed network characterized by equation 11 guarantees that the positive neural activity is able to be propagated to all the state space but the negative activity only stays locally therefore the target globally attracts the auv while the obstacles only locally avoid the collision the activity landscape of the neural network dynamically changes due to the varying external inputs from the targets and obstacles and the internal activity propagation among neurons the optimal auv path is planned from the dynamic activity landscape and the previous auv location the auv will move to the neuron with maximal neural activity after the current location reaches its next location the next location becomes a new current location the current auv location adaptively changes according to the varying environment the activity landscape of the neural network dynamically changes due to the varying external inputs from the target and obstacles and the internal activity propagation among neurons for energy and time efficiency the auv should travel a shortest path and make least turning of moving directions for a given current auv location denoted by l c the next auv location l n is obtained by luo et al 2014b yang and luo 2004 15 l n arg max m n x m n n s m n where s is the number of neighboring neurons of the l c th neuron s 8 i e all the possible next locations of the current location l c variable x m n is the neural activity of the l th neuron in the search task the neural activity landscape will never reach a steady state as in 2 d environments each auv keeps moving toward the neuron location with the maximum activity in the detection region in the proposed model due to the very large external input constant e the target and obstacles keep staying at the peak and valley of the activity landscape of the neural network respectively thus auvs should be able to search the target efficiently with obstacle avoidance before their search tasks are finished at the same time each auv searches in different direction so as not to cause conflict in this way the multi auv team can realize cooperation in an efficient way 3 2 the bio inspired cascaded tracking control approach in order to prevent dynamic targets from escaping auv team member needs to track each of them ever since it is detected this needs a precise tracking control considering that the auv s major movement is in three degrees of freedom dof surge sway yaw so in this paper only the three dof tracking control problem is presented the controller design problem can be described as follows the desired state of auv is defined as 16 η d x d y d ψ d t where η d x d y d ψ d t is the desired state of auv in the inertial frame x d y d is coordinate of desired path in global cartesian workspace the inertial frame ψ is the counter clockwise rotation angle of auv the desired forward and angular velocities can be deduced by 17 u d x d cos ψ d y d sin ψ d v d x d sin ψ d y d cos ψ d r d ψ d x d y d x d y d x d 2 y d 2 the actual state of auv is represented by η x y ψ t q u v r t as the objective of the path tracking controllers is to make auv follow the known path by controlling the velocity and angular velocities so the tracking error e x x d x e y y d y e ψ ψ d ψ converges to zero here e η d η e x e y e ψ t is the tracking error in the inertial frame in the body fixed frame the tracking error is e u cos ψ e x sin ψ e y e v sin ψ e x cos ψ e y e r e ψ a detailed model of tracking control problem is given in fig 4 the basic control architecture of the system is illustrated in fig 5 the design of the cascaded control strategy consists of two parts 1 an outer loop auxiliary velocity controller by using position and orientation state errors 2 an inner loop sliding mode controller by using velocity state vector an auxiliary velocity control inputs are generated by a novel velocity controller based on bio inspired model the bio inspired model is used to guarantee the position error asymptotically stable and eliminate or inhibit the sharp speed jumps of the velocity commonly existing in backstepping method due to the tracking errors changing suddenly then a sliding mode controller is used to generate the control forces torques which is designed to drive the auv and make the linear and angular velocities of the auv converge to the reference velocities 3 2 1 backstepping velocity controller backstepping method for nonholonomic mobile auv has been designed for velocity tracking sankaranarayanan and mahindrakar 2009 sun et al 2014 but the auv in this study is a holonomic system so the backstepping control law for the mobile auv is not fit for this control system for this reason a new backstepping control law is designed for auv and makes it possible to follow a given reference posture with stability one thing that needed to be stated is that the backstepping method in this paper is only concerned about the kinematic control the auxiliary velocity controller based on the backstepping approach can be designed as 18 q c u c v c r c k e x cos ψ e y sin ψ u d cos e ψ v d sin e ψ k e x sin ψ e y cos ψ u d sin e ψ v d cos e ψ r d k ψ e ψ where k k ψ are constant coefficients q d u d v d r d t is the desired velocity in the body fixed frame u d cos e ψ v d sin e ψ u d sin e ψ v d cos e ψ represents the desired velocity frame transformed to the actual velocity frame seen in fig 4 by analyzing the performance of the traditional backstepping velocity controller this controller occurs the sharp speed jumps when tracking errors change suddenly it means that the required acceleration and forces torques are very large even infinite which may exceed vehicle s control constraint and it is usually practically impossible however the biological neural model is of the characteristics such as stability bounded activity and smooth response it may be used to produce a bounded and smooth auxiliary signal related to tracking errors to improve the real time velocity commands so we add bio inspired neurons dynamics model to velocity controller 3 2 2 bio inspired velocity controller bio inspired neural dynamics model was first developed by grossberg it can describe an on line adaptive behavior of individuals it was originally derived based on the membrane model proposed by hodgkin and huxley for a patch of membrane using electrical elements the dynamics of voltage across the membrane v m can be described in the membrane model using state equation technique as 19 c m d v m d t e p v m g p e n a v m g n a e k v m g k where c m is the membrane capacitance the parameters e k e n a and e p are the nernst potentials for potassium ions sodium ions and passive leak current in the membrane respectively g k g p and g n a are the conductance of potassium sodium and the passive channels are functions of input signals that vary with time to simplify the equation a shunting equation is obtained as 20 v a v b v s t d v s t where v is the neural activity membrane potential of the neuron parameters a b and d are respectively the passive decay rate the upper and lower bounds of the neural activity the variables s and s represent the excitatory and inhibitory input respectively the shunting dynamic of an individual neuron can be modeled by this equation the neutron dynamics are restricted to a bounded interval d b and an automatic gain control so we can infer the shunting equation to the following form 21 v i a v i b v i f e i d v i g e i where f e i max e i 0 g e i max e i 0 a b d are positive constants for a system with appropriate chosen inputs various desirable functional properties such as competitive short memory upper bound and lower bound can be derived from the model the bio inspired model is a continuous differential equation and can also be regarded as a low pass filter the systems output v is guaranteed to stay in a region d b for any excitatory and inhibitory inputs several advantages such as the guaranteed stability and efficient computation are provided by the model for the auv tracking control in this paper the tracking errors e η d η in the inertial frame are chosen as the inputs of the bio inspired model while the outputs v i i x y ψ will replace the tracking errors e in 18 so the proposed auxiliary velocity controller can be written as 22 q c u c v c r c k v x cos ψ v y sin ψ u d cos e ψ v d sin e ψ k v x sin ψ v y cos ψ u d sin e ψ v d cos e ψ r d k ψ v ψ where k k ψ are the same parameters of 18 due to the shunting characteristics of bio inspired model the output of the bio inspired model is bounded in a finite interval and smooth without any sharp jumps when inputs have sudden changes so the controller performance is significantly improved 3 2 3 the adaptive sliding mode controller in the normal way if only the kinematic model is considered the tracking control design is complete however perfect velocity tracking is assumed to be hold in the kinematic control which is unrealistic in practice in this section the kinematic control is extended to the dynamic case the suitable forces moments to drive the vehicle tracking a given reference vehicle are then derived from the velocity control input we address the problem where parametric uncertainties exist in the dynamics of the follower subjected to unknown ocean disturbances in this case an adaptive sliding mode controller is proposed to deal with the challenging problem as a rule sliding mode control can be divided into two parts first define a sliding manifold s second find a control law to move toward the sliding manifold define an auxiliary velocity error 23 e c q c q then the sliding manifold is defined as 24 s e c 2 λ e c λ 2 e c λ represents a strictly positive constant s is a 2 1 vector derivation of 24 then 25 s e c 2 λ e c λ 2 e c e c 2 λ q c q λ 2 e c when the system is operating on the sliding surface 25 equals zero i e 26 s e c 2 λ e c λ 2 e c e c 2 λ q c q λ 2 e c 0 substituting 9 into 26 then 27 e c 2 λ q c m 1 τ cq dq g λ 2 e 0 so the equivalent control law can be concluded as 28 τ e q m ˆ q c e c 2 λ λ 2 e c c ˆ q d ˆ q g ˆ where m ˆ c ˆ d ˆ g ˆ are estimated terms considering the difficulty of computing e c in 28 a feedback control input of acceleration error is introduced 29 e c k e c where k is a constant scalar representing the strictly positive constant that determines the rate of acceleration error the conventional sliding mode can be designed as 30 τ τ e q k sgn s to eliminate chattering problem caused by the discontinuous term an adaptive term rong jong 2007 is added in the control law to replace the switching term 31 τ a d τ e s t k c ˆ 2 λ s where τ e s t is an adaptive term that estimates the lumped uncertainty vector defined in 10 k is also a constant scalar representing the strictly positive constant related to the convergence rate of the controller the estimation of the lumped uncertainty vector is proposed to follow 32 τ e s t γ s where γ represent the strictly positive constant that determines the rate of adaption the total control law can be defined as 33 τ τ e q τ a d τ e q τ e s t k c ˆ 2 λ s 4 simulation studies in simulations a tritech mk2 sonar is mounted on the auv for target search and tracking the sonar is a mechanical scanning one which continuously rotates the transducer to sends a narrow fan shaped acoustic beam to scan a full 360 sector the surrounding environments the operating frequency of the sonar is 700 khz the vertical and horizontal beam widths are 30 and 3 respectively the maximum range is up to 100 m auvs and their targets are allowed to move within the given space when one target moves into any auv s sensing range this target is regarded as being detected if there is a dynamic target it is then followed and tracked after all targets within the given space have been found the search task ends simulation experiments conducted are coded in matlab including different cases of search for static or dynamic targets and tracking with different paths 4 1 target search 4 1 1 static targets search to test the basic performance of the proposed algorithm the first simulation is conducted for static targets this simulation involves three targets three auvs and several obstacles in unknown underwater environments whose initial positions are distributed as shown in fig 6 a at the beginning of the search task since the target will impact the entire search area through neural transmission the activity of each neuron can be derived from the shunting equation 11 when an auv makes a selection of its path it compares the activity value of the neuron of its current location with its neighbors and chooses the one with the highest value as the next step in the gbnn the targets and obstacles are respectively excitation and inhibitory of the neural network by repeating this performance auvs keep moving towards their targets and are able to round obstacles to avoid collision as shown in fig 6 b static target t1 t2 and t3 are found by auv r3 r2 and r1 respectively this shows that the proposed algorithm realizes a joint search for multiple static targets in case auvs are outnumbered by their targets the approach works as well as shown in fig 7 there are six targets and four auvs target t1 is found by auv r3 target t2 and t3 by auv r2 target t4 and t5 by auv r1 and target t6 by auv r1 therefore the proposed algorithm can achieve search task with different number of auvs and targets 4 1 2 dynamic targets search the second simulation is conducted to test search for multiple dynamic targets which will undoubtedly cause more difficulties but the proposed algorithm in this paper exactly overcomes this difficulty due to the pre definition the activity values of the neurons in the targets are positive and the target globally attracts auvs through the dynamic neural activity landscape of the model according to equation 11 activity values of auv s neighbor neurons will change accordingly when the target s location changes through the change of activity values of neighboring neurons the real time information about the ever changing locations of the mobile target can be obtained by each auv the proposed algorithm can constantly adjust search paths according to changes of the neighboring neural activity value fig 8 clearly shows this process of three auvs search for three dynamic targets among them the targets move at random and auvs move according to principles of the gbnn fig 8 a presents the initial positions of auvs targets and obstacles as shown in fig 8 b dynamic targets t1 t2 and t3 are found by auv r3 r2 and r1 respectively obviously the simulation result shows that the proposed algorithm realizes a joint search for multiple dynamic targets if the initial positions of auvs are in the center of the workspace as shown in fig 9 a the performance of the gbnn is given as follows 4 1 3 dynamic obstacles the gbnn algorithm can avoid not only static obstacles but also dynamic ones in fig 10 a o1 is a dynamic obstacle the speed of o1 is lower than that of the auvs at the first beginning auv r1 r2 and r3 are able to head northwest without any obstacles in their way however when o1 the obstacle moves into the way of r1 a collision is inevitable if r1 keeps moving along its pre determined trajectory to solve this problem the gbnn adjusts the activity values of r1 s neighbor neurons i e it s next moving direction according to real time changes in environmental information and thus make it possible for r1 to change its moving directions to avoid o1 likewise it happens to r2 when it is traversed by o1 by re planning a collision free path the gbnn proves to be effective to avoid dynamic obstacles during the search process shown as in fig 10 b 4 1 4 comparison of different algorithms in order to further validate the performance of the proposed algorithm comparison studies with the potential field based particle swarm optimization ppso algorithm will be carried out the potential field is implemented in the fitness function of the particle swarm optimization pso which provides with reasonable evaluations of the underwater environments the pso algorithm plans a path by iteratively improving a candidate solution with regard to the fitness function cao et al 2015 the comparison studies involve three dynamic targets three auvs and some obstacles with environments scale of 40 40 two algorithms are applied to the multi auvs that are directed to search all the targets in these conditions two algorithms respectively complete 50 times simulation experiments of target searching in each simulation experiment the initial positions of the auvs and the targets being searched for as well as the location of obstacles are all randomly distributed to make a clear distinction between the two algorithms table 1 lists the mean and standard deviation statistics of path length time of complete the task energy consumption by both algorithms it is reasonable to conclude that the integrated algorithm of gbnn performs better than the ppso in each item of simulation results hence it distinguishes itself with the shorter path length and time and lower energy consumption 4 2 tracking control for dynamic targets tracking is necessary after they are detected for fear of their escape considering that the auv s major movement is in three degrees of freedom dof surge sway yaw so in this simulation only the three dof tracking control problem is presented due to this paper focuses on whether each auv detector can track its prey target as intended and whether the tracking error is within the expected range and the limited length of this paper the targets motion trajectories are assumed to be known in advance without regard to their generation in this section curve path tracking and circular path tracking are simulated 4 2 1 curve path tracking assuming that the motion trajectory of dynamic target t2 is a curve and its initial posture is 0 2 0 0 while the initial posture of auv r2 is 0 3 0 0 we get an initial posture error 0 1 0 0 time varies from 0 to 30s assume the desired track state of auv r2 is x d t 0 03 t 0 2 y d t 0 03 t ψ d π 4 to reflect uncertainties of the vehicle dynamics 20 model inaccuracies error were incorporated into the controller s dynamic model the parameter setting of the cascaded controller is shown in table 2 the simulation process in this paper can be described as follows for the bio inspired cascaded tracking control model the auxiliary velocity controller q c can be calculated by 22 then the control forces and moments τ τ x τ y τ n t can be generated by the sliding mode controller 32 using the auxiliary velocity controller q c and next the control forces and moments τ will be applied to the auv models to produce the actual velocity in surge sway yaw q u v r t respectively finally it will be easy to get the actual underwater vehicle s states η x y ψ t by η j q fig 11 shows the simulation results of the curve tracking the yellow solid line in the zoom in indicates the motion trajectory of dynamic target t2 and the blue solid line the tracking trajectory of auv r2 in fig 11 the bio inspired cascaded tracking control method can catch up and land on the desired path smoothly with a quick response for which a reasonable explanation can be found in auxiliary velocity response in fig 12 being a velocity controller the bio inspired model is confined in the range of d b with its output due to the shunting characteristics as seen in fig 12 the auxiliary velocity terms with the bio inspired model are smooth without any sharp jumps and all the control variables are limited in the saturation point to make an in depth analysis of these simulation results the tracking errors of curve path are shown in fig 13 as we can see the tracking error of x direction becomes 0 in 2 s while that of y direction becomes 0 in 5 s at the same time the tracking error of x direction can be limited in the range of 0 1 0 1 while that of y direction in the range of 0 007 0 007 in brief it can be concluded that the proposed bio inspired tracking control method is practical and effective 4 2 2 circular path tracking another typical case of tracking method is circular path tracking for instance auv r3 starts at posture 0 5 0 5 0 and the target t4 at 0 5 0 9 0 with an initial posture error is 0 0 4 0 time varies from 0 to 200s the desired track state of auv r3 is x d t sin 0 5 t y d t cos 0 5 t ψ d t 0 5 t the parameter setting of the hybrid controller is shown in table 3 the other settings are the same as those in curve path simulation fig 14 shows the simulation results of the circular tracking with which the yellow solid line in the zoom in indicates the tracking trajectory of dynamic target t4 and the blue solid line of auv r3 with a comparison similar results to the curve path tracking are obtained in this simulation experiment in the simulation results of trajectory tracking in fig 14 the bio inspired cascaded tracking control method can drive to reach and stay on the trajectory in quick response and can drive in a satisfactory way fig 15 shows the auxiliary velocity of the bio inspired tracking control method with this method none of the control value exceeds their maximum control values and all of the control forces are restricted below the propeller s control saturation point this proves the efficiency of the proposed cascaded tracking method in depth analysis of these simulation results fig 16 shows the tracking error of curve path as can be seen from the fig 16 the tracking error of x direction becomes 0 after 1 s the tracking error of y direction becomes to 0 after 1 s and the tracking error of θ becomes to 0 after 1 5 s at the same time the tracking error of x direction can be limited in the range of 0 7 0 7 and the tracking error of y direction can be limited in the range of 0 5 0 5 and the tracking error of θ can be limited in the range of 0 05 0 05 in brief it can be concluded that the proposed bio inspired tracking control method is practical and effective 5 conclusion in this paper a gbnn and bio inspired cascaded tracking control approach are integrated to realize cooperative search and tracking for static as well as dynamic targets in unknown underwater environments with obstacles on the one hand it makes full use of the advantages of gbnn with which no information about the workspace or pre learning is needed and few parameter adjustments would be made on the other hand the application of bio inspired cascaded tracking control model in the velocity controller can solve the speed jump problem and promise each propeller within its saturation limit with simulation experiments it is shown that the integrated algorithm not only enables the multi auv team to accomplish its search task but also it ensures a successful tracking of dynamic targets despite the advantages of this algorithm some problems are still insufficiently considered for instance factors in real environments like ocean currents are excluded in these simulations therefore further studies are needed for better algorithms that can accord with the real 3 d underwater environments acknowledgment this project is supported by the

and the end location in an environment with obstacles under various kinds of constraints such as geometry topology technique codes and regulations prd plays a significant role in industry especially in ship design the research of prd has developed from simple constraints in two dimensions to multi objective constraints in three dimensional space since 1970s the conventional methods include maze

useful and valuable to the further research of prd however there was no set of mature theory and ideal method until now because of the various layout environment and complicated constraints prd is one of the main contents of the ship design the good ship pipe route design is very important for the safety economy maneuverability maintenance rationality of overall layout safe navigation and guaranteeing the normal operation of all kinds of machinery sprd has always been the hot and difficult issues in ship design some intelligent algorithms have been used to solve it kang et al 1999

system for dealing with complex problem zhang et al 2012 huo et al 2010 and liu and teng 2008 used the method of human computer cooperation for satellite module layout optimization design and achieved good results from the research production achieved for prd optimization we can find most researches were focused on algorithm itself in this case designers expertise and experience are not fully utilized and the process of prd optimization lacks of effective guiding means it is difficult to obtain the stable solution wich can meet engineering requirements at present two key problems need to be solved for sprd one is how to construct the effective algorithm the other is how to make full use of the knowledge and experience of piping design experts in this paper a hcciaco algorithm is

the further research 2 key technique of sprd optimization approach based on human computer cooperation 2 1 access to artificial individuals in order to achieve effective human computer cooperation in sprd various kinds of aspects should be considered the fundamental approach is to realize gene fusion and information interaction between artificial solution and algorithm solution therefore the first step is to acquire artificial individuals there are three major means to obtain artificial individuals as follows 1 self designed method to a specific sprd optimization problem designers normally experienced pipe experts and engineers design artificial individual themselves taking engineering practice and calculation environment into full consideration and meanwhile thinking about the coding system of algorithm individual with their expertise and long term design experience accumulated the advantage of it is that the design solution combines with good property of algorithm individual and complies with various kinds of constraint conditions of layout environment with great feasibility however it has low automation and requires high standard for designers when it comes to the complicated optimization design in 3d this method can consume a lot of time and require loads of design work 2 preferential method to different pipe route optimization design designers selected the best algorithm individual from pure algorithm optimization solutions as artificial individual for engineering practice and calculation environment based on their expertise and experience this method saves a lot of time and energy but because of low participation rate of designers in the production of artificial individual designers expertise and experience are not fully utilized which may lead to the lack of fine genes in artificial individual besides this method has a high standard for algorithm related which greatly increases the difficulty of algorithm design process 3 modification method aiming at the optimal design of a specific pipeline designers selected pure algorithm optimization solution with proper modification as artificial individual for engineering practice and calculation environment based on their expertise and experience this method fully considers the designers experience and maintains high efficacy meanwhile good human computer cooperation is guaranteed by adding good genes to artificial individual which algorithm individual don t possess 2 2 artificial individual reference set construction artificial individual reference set airs consists of experience and achievement of pipe experts and engineers as well as individual updating rules in the process of algorithm iteration the individual updating rules is pre designed in the procedure and is consistent during iteration pipe experts and engineers can participate during iteration and inspect efficacy of algorithm to maintain diversity in airs index m std for evaluating diversity of reference set is adopted to begin with m std should be calculated when airs is updating difference values between new artificial individual and original artificial individuals should be calculated compare the minimum difference value m min with m std if m min m std put new artificial individual into reference set otherwise the information will be delivered to designers designers can make changes on new artificial individual to satisfy the requirement or redesign a new artificial individual the flowchart of airs is presented in fig 1 diversity difference value m min a b between artificial individual a and b in reference set can be denoted by euclindean distance as follows 1 m min a b i 1 n a i b i 2 i 1 2 n 2 3 combination methods between artificial individual and algorithm individual pipe design engineers give artificial individual through numerical design plan of spr and add it to airs pure algorithm solution that fulfills requirements related can also be put into airs based on the above airs is developed to diversity scheme reference set dsrs so as to obtain artificial individuals of better combination with algorithm individuals artificial individuals of airs and dsrs are coded to form a unified numerical code pool with a specific coding mode their fitness value and diversity value decide whether they can be added into evolutionary algorithm or not in order to achieve a consistent dynamic information fusion between the artificial solution and algorithm solution three fusion methods can be adopted the first one is substitute method add artificial individuals to algorithm colony by replacing algorithm individuals of same quantity the replaced algorithm individuals can be randomly determined or chosen from relatively inferior ones the second one is crossover method randomly choose algorithm individual from algorithm colony and perform crossover with certain artificial individual then randomly pick one from two sub individuals produced and put it back into the algorithm colony this method guarantees sufficient information interaction and fusion of gene segments of artificial individual and algorithm individual the third one is crossover with multiple objective function weighting method according to engineering requirements and algorithm operation condition of prd weighting coefficients of different objective functions are adjusted manually then perform crossover method so that individuals in algorithm colony acquire part of artificial individual gene the human computer cooperation mechanism of sprd is shown in fig 2 to fully utilize artificial solution and promote information fusion of artificial individual and algorithm individual addition of artificial individual should meet the following three rules good timing proper quantity and moderate performance of artificial individual 3 sprd optimization model 3 1 date structure model the purpose of prd is to figure out an optimal route from a start location to an end location in an environment with obstacles under various kinds of constraints in sprd problem the main constraints include jiang et al 2015 avoid obstacles minimize the length of pipe line and the number of elbows arrange pipes orthogonally and along walls if possible consider the convenience of installation and frequent maintenance in sprd problem the search environment can be simplified to a cubic model space in the coordinate system the space is meshed according to pipeline diameters and interval distance and each node corresponds to a spatial coordinate value x y z the data structure is defined as follows and shown in fig 3 path node1 node2 noden node x y z in the cubic model space the pipe route is presented from one node to another nodes that are on the same rout should be different from each other it avoids overlapping of pipe route besides to avoid a basically diagonal path and guarantee a continuous one for any two neighbor nodes one node must lie in another of the spatial six directions of the other node in such a way node x y z on the path should be updated within the following range x 1 y z x 1 y z x y 1 z x y 1 z x y z 1 x y z 1 every node is endowed with two parameters energy value e ito 1999 and state value o which will be used in the formulation of ship pipe routing problem in section 3 4 the e represents the priority of searching path the lower e appears the more appropriate the search path is for instance when the pipe route goes along the wall equipment and pipe supporter the energy value e appears low according to pipe route layout regulations and constraints layout space is divided into advantage area transition area general area and prohibited area energy value e increases from advantage area to general area in addition if the node is within prohibited area then state value o appears to be 1 which means the node determined is within obstacles otherwise state value is 0 denoting that node determined is out of the prohibited area 3 2 obstacle model hierarchical bounding volumes zhu et al 2008 method is applied to simplify obstacles in ship pipe route layout space in this method one or more cuboids are used to include both regular and irregular obstacles these cuboids obtained are defined as prohibited areas 3 3 direction guiding mechanism without direction guidance in prd randomly generated path is time consuming however there is no randomness in all directions and it is difficult to produce good genes that satisfy constraints therefore initial path is built by randomly generated method with direction guidance direction guiding mechanism ensures that the possibility of start point moving to ending point overwhelms that of the reverse case so that initial individual has high possibility of production with good genes 3 4 layout optimization model pipe route optimization design works on searching a path with minimum length from the start location to the ending location meanwhile different kinds of constraint conditions in aspects of physics economy safety and regulations manufacture and installation and operation and maintenance are satisfied for sprd in 3d space main constraints are obstacles divided into two categories shown in fig 4 fig 4 a is obstacle surface with low node energy value e such as wall supporter and pipe routes laid fig 4 b is obstacle surface with high node energy value e including heat sensitive region pipe route is expected to lay closely to the former obstacle surface and keep away from the latter for single pipe routing main task is to find a path with minimum length and elbows besides state value o of all nodes should be 0 and energy value e should be kept as lower as possible so the path is determined around obstacles of the first category a fitness function is defined to demonstrate single pipe optimization design as the following 2 f i t n e s s p 1 exp a l p b b p c e p d o p where l p i 1 n n o d e i n o d e i 1 e p i 1 n e i l p denotes the path length b p denotes the number of elbows on path e p represents the total energy value of path p and e i is the energy value on node i of path p o p is penalty function representing the number of nodes located on the forbidden regions namely obstacles on path p a b c d are their weights respectively according to the fitness function introduced the pipe route is more preferred when fitness value is higher 4 algorithm realization in this section the hcciaco algorithm is presented to solve sprd problem aco algorithm was introduced by colorni et al in 1991 since then aco algorithm theory has been developed substantially with several breakthroughs achieved by worldwide researchers many large scale combinatorial optimization problems were solved with aco algorithm such as tsp traveling salesman problem qap quadratic assignment problem jsp job shop schedule problem and so on aco algorithm shows great superiority in solving combinatorial optimization problem marked by powerful parallel computing ability strong robustness and flexible expansion ability with continuous development and application expansion aco algorithm shows remarkable solving ability in a variety of fields although basic aco algorithm shows some superiority in solving combinatorial optimization problem it has the disadvantages of premature convergence and slow convergence rate aco algorithm is improved according to the characteristics of sprd to overcome the defects in this paper in the hcciaco algorithm the direction guidance mechanism is established to improve the convergence speed the propsosed algorithm conbines the artificial sulotion and algorithm solution in the genetic sense of the improved ant colony optimization iaco algorithm and takes full advantage of designers expertise and experience as well as computers calculation ability meanwhile local search operation interlace operation and heuristic mutation operation are adopted for sprd to enhance the quality of the solution 4 1 population initialization and heuristic information initial path of each ant in ant colony is randomly generated under direction guiding mechanism direction guiding mechanism ensures that when ants move to next node from current node the probability of ants moving towards ending location is much bigger than that of ants moving in reverse in grid space model each node has six adjacent nodes three of them are towards ending location and the other three go in reverse for pipe route relative coordinate positions between start location and ending location amount to eight shown in fig 5 and table 1 fan et al 2007a b probability of different corresponding direction can be determined according to table 2 in fact the probability of corresponding direction equals to heuristic information η i j k in the iaco algorithm and also initial pheromone t 0 i j k 0 of all nodes is set considering the timing of human computer cooperation a proper portion of artificial individuals can be added during population initialization 4 2 determination of direction probability every path that ants move from start location to ending location in grid space model is a solution of algorithm in the process of path searching ants constantly choose an adjacent node for the kth ant on the node x y z the selection probability of next node is determined by the following function 3 3 s k max p i j k j k α t i j k β η i j k i f q q 0 p k i j k o t h e r p k i j k α t i j k β η i j k p i j k j k α t i j k β η i j k i j k i f p i j k j k 0 o t h e r where j k is the set of feasible neighbor nodes of the current node x y z whose maximum neighbor node number is six as previously mentioned q ε 0 1 is a uniform random number q 0 is the proportion of occasions when the greedy selection technique is used t i j k and η i j k are respectively the pheromone intensity and the heuristic information on node i j k α is the weight of the pheromone intensity t i j k and β is the relative importance of the heuristic information η i j k which is stated above other parameters are the same as before 4 3 construction of algorithm individual during population initialization ants choose nodes and searching path according to heuristic information only in the following iteration both heuristic information and pheromone intensity are considered for construction of algorithm individual to avoid node repetition in the process of path searching nodes visited are recorded in dynamically updated table tabu besides based on human computer cooperation theory a certain number of artificial individuals can replace algorithm individuals of same quantity the rules are the following first compare artificial individuals and algorithm individuals in an ergodic mean then exchange path of artificial individuals and algorithm individuals that have the same nodes and if there are multiple identical nodes a node is randomly selected and exchange the exchanged individuals are marked and not available for the rest of the artificial individuals randomly select an algorithm individual available and perform crossover with them by choosing respectively two intermediate nodes from the two paths for ant to generate sub path the process won t stop until all artificial individuals complete crossover process 4 4 local search and heuristic operation because of information feedback algorithm is easy to converge to local optimal solution by performing local search operation in the iaco algorithm searching region is enlarged in an attempt to enhance the quality of the solution converging to global optimal solution in pipe route layout space two methods are proposed to perform local search operation the first way margin is defined as a fixed number of unchanged generation and kmargin is defined as a variable number of unchanged generation if kmargin margin keep iteration otherwise perform mutation operation of local optimal solution converged choose two intermediate nodes from the solution path for ant to generate sub path so that ants get rid of original convergence circle and keep evolving the second way if kmargin margin perform crossover operation on artificial individual and algorithm individual converged in the genetic level crossover operation is introduced in section 4 3 it helps algorithm get rid of local optimal solution range and meanwhile promotes better convergence of artificial individual and algorithm individual in the genetic level moreover designers experience is preserved and utilized in the algorithm interlace operation and heuristic mutation operation is adopted for prd heuristic mutation operations are shown in fig 6 including elbow elimination a obstacle avoidance b and loop elimination c 4 5 pheromone updating rules the quality of pheromone updating is crucial for aco algorithm convergence two updating methods are used for i aco algorithm in sprd the first is local pheromone updating li 2004 update pheromone of nodes that ants have visited it produces discrete solution and improves diversity of solution set the updating rule is defined as follow 4 t t 1 k i j k ρ t t k i j k where t t k i j k t t 1 k i j k is the pheromone intensity of node i j k during t and t 1 iteration of ant k ρ is the pheromone residual parameter the second is global pheromone updating fan et al 2007a b when all of the ants have completed their paths and the local search has been finished the global pheromone updating is employed to all nodes visited this updating process of pheromone is equivalent to offline pheromone trail updating of ant colony system but it is applied to all ants in an iterative mode the rule is described as follows 5 d o t t 1 k i j k ρ t t k i j k ω f t k p w h i l e k m where 6 ω c o n s t 1 i f i j k o p t i m a l p a t h c o n s t 2 i f i j k w o r s t p a t h c o n s t 3 i f o t h e r where ω is a phase constant c o n s t 1 c o n s t 3 c o n s t 2 depends on quality of path f t k p is the fitness value of ant k during t iteration and m is gross of ants 4 6 stopping criterion the optimization algorithm is performed under the condition of human computer cooperation and the two methods can be used as the stopping criterion one is to use the maximum iteration number as the stopping criterion of the algorithm and the other is to use the no evolutionary generations as the stopping criterion take the algorithm which has artificial individuals involved in population initialization for example the flowchart of proposed hcciaco algorithm is shown in fig 7 5 simulation and results two experiments are made in order to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in the first simulation experiment improved ant colony optimization algorithm without artificial solution involved is adopted in the second simulation experiment hcciaco algorithm considering artificial individuals in iaco algorithm to realize human computer cooperation is executed the parameters used are set in table 3 some of the parameters are the traditional parameters of aco fan et al 2007a b the percentage of artificial individuals of the hcciaco algorithm make greater effect on the result of optimization which has been discussed in the section 6 in the simulation experiment sprd search space is cuboid shown in fig 8 diagonal coordinates of the cuboid are 0 0 0 and 50 50 50 in grid space model the cubic cells amount to 50 50 50 six obstacles are within the search space their diagonal coordinates are 6 0 0 and 16 5 50 21 0 0 and 30 5 4 42 10 0 and 50 18 12 42 26 0 and 50 42 12 20 42 0 and 30 50 50 0 15 0 and 9 32 20 14 14 0 and 34 35 21 the start location of ship pipe route is 0 0 0 and the ending location is 50 50 50 each experiment is executed 20 times and the iteration times are 200 compare and analysis of the two algorithm solutions are shown in table 4 because this model is relatively simple its fitness value can be manually determined which is 0 0992 by comparison the solution of hcciaco algorithm is better than pure computer solution of iaco algorithm at avoiding the problem of local optimum and accelerating the convergence rate optimal solution of iaco algorithm without artificial individuals involved is shown in fig 9 the path avoids all obstacles in its process of path searching low energy value region is preferentially chosen pipe route is preferentially set along bulkhead or obstacles surface and no loop occurs in the solution besides 4 elbows are contained in this solution and its fitness value is 0 0978 optimal solution of hcciaco algorithm is shown in fig 10 the artificial individuals added to algorithm individuals during population initialization fitness values range from 0 07 to 0 08 all obstacles are successfully avoided and the number of elbows is 3 which is the theoretical value low energy value region is preferentially chosen meanwhile the fitness value reaches to the theoretical value 0 0992 from above it is easy to see that the proposed hcciaco algorithm has better performance than pure computer algorithm hcciaco algorithm not only improves the convergence speed but also improves the quality of the solution the probability of finding the global optimal solution is greater the solution is to a large extent improved by accelerating algorithm convergence rate and enlarging population convergence proportion with the increasing complexity of space model the superiority of hcciaco algorithm is becoming more evident 6 analysis on addition principles of artificial individuals to fully utilize artificial individual and promote information fusion of artificial individual and algorithm individual addition of artificial individual should follow three principles good timing proper quantity and moderate property of artificial individual in this section these three principles are analyzed respectively from the sprd point of view and space model in fig 8 is adopted the start location is 0 0 0 and the ending location is 50 50 50 6 1 time to join two means for artificial individual addition in hcciaco algorithm are consider the first is to add artificial individuals during population initialization the second is to add artificial individuals when non evolution times reach to fixed generation the percentage of artificial individuals is 20 of total population the fitness values of artificial individuals added range from 0 07 to 0 08 other parameters are listed in table 3 the results are shown in table 5 it is easy to see that the global optimum can be found by the two methods the solution of the first mean has been substantially improved compared to that of pure computer iteration by adding artificial individuals during population initialization while the second means give even better solution by adding artificial individuals when non evolution times reach to fixed generation the reason is that some of good genes of artificial individuals added during population initialization are abandoned by algorithm during the following crossover process the results show that the second mean gives a better solution with high utilization efficiency of artificial individuals 6 2 quantity to join proper quantity of artificial individuals is necessary for too many the algorithm prematurely converges to artificial individual and advantages of algorithm individuals are neglected meanwhile designers share large workload for too few guidance effect of designers is not taken into full play and good genes are easily abandoned during algorithm iteration according to number of artificial individuals the experimental model was used to study the number of artificial individuals accounted for 10 20 30 and 40 respectively from the results shown in fig 11 when artificial individuals account for 20 of total population the algorithm solution reaches to the highest average fitness value 6 3 property to join the property of the adding artificial individual will affect the result of the algorithm in the experiment the number of artificial individuals is 20 and the time of adding is when non evolution times reach to fixed generation the fitness values of the artificial individuals are 0 05 0 06 0 06 0 07 0 07 0 08 and 0 08 0 09 the experimental results are shown in fig 12 for the experimental model the added artificial individuals fitness value is 0 07 0 08 when the added individual performance is too low the degree of improvement of the algorithm is limited when the added individual performance is too high the excellent genes of the algorithm individuals are difficult to be effectively inherited and utilized in the iterative process therefore the performance of the convergence results is closer to the performance of the artificial individuals in addition because this experimental model is relatively simple it is easy to find a good performance of artificial individuals the sprd is very complicated and many factors are considered in the process of arranging the pipeline it is difficult to find the artificial individuals with excellent performance therefore in the process of optimizing the sprd should try to join the high performance of artificial individuals

useful and valuable to the further research of prd however there was no set of mature theory and ideal method until now because of the various layout environment and complicated constraints prd is one of the main contents of the ship design the good ship pipe route design is very important for the safety economy maneuverability maintenance rationality of overall layout safe navigation and

good results from the research production achieved for prd optimization we can find most researches were focused on algorithm itself in this case designers expertise and experience are not fully utilized and the process of prd optimization lacks of effective guiding means it is difficult to obtain the stable solution wich can meet engineering requirements at present two key problems need to be solved for sprd one is how to construct the effective algorithm the other is how to make full use of the knowledge and experience of piping design experts in this paper a hcciaco algorithm is

complies with various kinds of constraint conditions of layout environment with great feasibility however it has low automation and requires high standard for designers when it comes to the complicated optimization design in 3d this method can consume a lot of time and require loads of design work 2 preferential method to different pipe route optimization design designers selected the best algorithm individual from pure algorithm optimization solutions as artificial individual for engineering practice and calculation environment based on their expertise and experience this method saves a lot of time and energy but because of low participation rate of designers in the production of artificial individual designers expertise and experience are not fully utilized which may lead to the lack of fine genes in artificial individual besides this method has a high standard for algorithm related which greatly increases the difficulty of algorithm design process 3 modification method aiming at the optimal design of a specific pipeline designers selected pure algorithm optimization solution with proper modification as artificial individual for engineering practice and calculation environment based on their expertise and experience this method fully considers the designers experience and maintains high efficacy meanwhile good human computer cooperation is guaranteed by adding good genes to artificial individual which algorithm individual don t possess 2 2 artificial individual reference set construction artificial individual reference set airs consists of experience and achievement of pipe experts and engineers as well as individual updating rules in the process of algorithm iteration the individual updating rules is pre designed in the procedure and is consistent during iteration pipe experts and engineers can participate during iteration and inspect efficacy of algorithm to maintain diversity in airs index m std for evaluating diversity of reference set is adopted to begin with m std should be calculated when airs is updating difference values between new artificial individual and original artificial individuals should be calculated compare the minimum difference value m min with m std if m min m std put new artificial individual into reference set otherwise the information will be delivered to designers designers can make changes on new artificial individual to satisfy the requirement or redesign a new artificial individual the flowchart of airs is presented in fig 1 diversity difference value m min a b between artificial individual a and b in reference set can be denoted by euclindean distance as follows 1 m min a b i 1 n a i b i 2 i 1 2 n 2 3 combination methods between artificial individual and algorithm individual pipe design engineers give artificial individual through numerical design plan of spr and add it to airs pure algorithm solution that fulfills requirements related can also be put into airs based on the above airs is developed to diversity scheme reference set dsrs so as to obtain artificial individuals of better combination with algorithm individuals artificial individuals of airs and dsrs are coded to form a unified numerical code pool with a specific coding mode their fitness value and diversity value decide whether they can be added into evolutionary algorithm or not in order to achieve a consistent dynamic information fusion between the artificial solution and algorithm solution three fusion methods can be adopted the first one is substitute method add artificial individuals to algorithm colony by replacing algorithm individuals of same quantity the replaced algorithm individuals can be randomly determined or chosen from relatively inferior ones the second one is crossover method randomly choose algorithm individual from algorithm colony and perform crossover with certain artificial individual then randomly pick one from two sub individuals produced and put it back into the algorithm colony this method guarantees sufficient information interaction and fusion of gene segments of artificial individual and algorithm individual the third one is crossover with multiple objective function weighting method according to engineering requirements and algorithm operation condition of prd weighting coefficients of different objective functions are adjusted manually then perform crossover method so that individuals in algorithm colony acquire part of artificial individual gene the human computer cooperation mechanism of sprd is shown in fig 2 to fully utilize artificial solution and promote information fusion of artificial individual and algorithm individual addition of artificial individual should meet the following three rules good timing proper quantity and moderate performance of artificial individual 3 sprd optimization model 3 1 date structure model the purpose of prd is to figure out an optimal route from a start location to an end location in an environment with obstacles under various kinds of constraints in sprd problem the main constraints include jiang et al 2015 avoid obstacles minimize the length of pipe line and the number of elbows arrange pipes orthogonally and along walls if possible consider the convenience of installation and frequent maintenance in sprd problem the search environment can be simplified to a cubic model space in the coordinate system the space is meshed according to pipeline diameters and interval distance and each node corresponds to a spatial coordinate value x y z the data structure is defined as follows and shown in fig 3 path node1 node2 noden node x y z in the cubic model space the pipe route is presented from one node to another nodes that are on the same rout should be different from each other it avoids overlapping of pipe route besides to avoid a basically diagonal path and guarantee a continuous one for any two neighbor nodes one node must lie in another of the spatial six directions of the other node in such a way node x y z on the path should be updated within the following range x 1 y z x 1 y z x y 1 z x y 1 z x y z 1 x y z 1 every node is endowed with two parameters energy value e ito 1999 and state value o which will be used in the formulation of ship pipe routing problem in section 3 4 the e represents the priority of searching path the lower e appears the more appropriate the search path is for instance when the pipe route goes along the wall equipment and pipe supporter the energy value e appears low according to pipe route layout regulations and constraints layout space is divided into advantage area transition area general area and prohibited area energy value e increases from advantage area to general area in addition if the node is within prohibited area then state value o appears to be 1 which means the node determined is within obstacles otherwise state value is 0 denoting that node determined is out of the prohibited area 3 2 obstacle model hierarchical bounding volumes zhu et al 2008 method is applied to simplify obstacles in ship pipe route layout space in this method one or more cuboids are used to include both regular and irregular obstacles these cuboids obtained are defined as prohibited areas 3 3 direction guiding mechanism without direction guidance in prd randomly generated path is time consuming however there is no randomness in all directions and it is difficult to produce good genes that satisfy constraints therefore initial path is built by randomly generated method with direction guidance direction guiding mechanism ensures that the possibility of start point moving to ending point overwhelms that of the reverse case so that initial individual has high possibility of production with good genes 3 4 layout optimization model pipe route optimization design works on searching a path with minimum length from the start location to the ending location meanwhile different kinds of constraint conditions in aspects of physics economy safety and regulations manufacture and installation and operation and maintenance are satisfied for sprd in 3d space main constraints are obstacles divided into two categories shown in fig 4 fig 4 a is obstacle surface with low node energy value e such as wall supporter and pipe routes laid fig 4 b is obstacle surface with high node energy value e including heat sensitive region pipe route is expected to lay closely to the former obstacle surface and keep away from the latter for single pipe routing main task is to find a path with minimum length and elbows besides state value o of all nodes should be 0 and energy value e should be kept as lower as possible so the path is determined around obstacles of the first category a fitness function is defined to demonstrate single pipe optimization design as the following 2 f i t n e s s p 1 exp a l p b b p c e p d o p where l p i 1 n n o d e i n o d e i 1 e p i 1 n e i l p denotes the path length b p denotes the number of elbows on path e p represents the total energy value of path p and e i is the energy value on node i of path p o p is penalty function representing the number of nodes located on the forbidden regions namely obstacles on path p a b c d are their weights respectively according to the fitness function introduced the pipe route is more preferred when fitness value is higher 4 algorithm realization in this section the hcciaco algorithm is presented to solve sprd problem aco algorithm was introduced by colorni et al in 1991 since then aco algorithm theory has been developed substantially with several breakthroughs achieved by worldwide researchers many large scale combinatorial optimization problems were solved with aco algorithm such as tsp traveling salesman problem qap quadratic assignment problem jsp job shop schedule problem and so on aco algorithm shows great superiority in solving combinatorial optimization problem marked by powerful parallel computing ability strong robustness and flexible expansion ability with continuous development and application expansion aco algorithm shows remarkable solving ability in a variety of fields although basic aco algorithm shows some superiority in solving combinatorial optimization problem it has the disadvantages of premature convergence and slow convergence rate aco algorithm is improved according to the characteristics of sprd to overcome the defects in this paper in the hcciaco algorithm the direction guidance mechanism is established to improve the convergence speed the propsosed algorithm conbines the artificial sulotion and algorithm solution in the genetic sense of the improved ant colony optimization iaco algorithm and takes full advantage of designers expertise and experience as well as computers calculation ability meanwhile local search operation interlace operation and heuristic mutation operation are adopted for sprd to enhance the quality of the solution 4 1 population initialization and heuristic information initial path of each ant in ant colony is randomly generated under direction guiding mechanism direction guiding mechanism ensures that when ants move to next node from current node the probability of ants moving towards ending location is much bigger than that of ants moving in reverse in grid space model each node has six adjacent nodes three of them are towards ending location and the other three go in reverse for pipe route relative coordinate positions between start location and ending location amount to eight shown in fig 5 and table 1 fan et al 2007a b probability of different corresponding direction can be determined according to table 2 in fact the probability of corresponding direction equals to heuristic information η i j k in the iaco algorithm and also initial pheromone t 0 i j k 0 of all nodes is set considering the timing of human computer cooperation a proper portion of artificial individuals can be added during population initialization 4 2 determination of direction probability every path that ants move from start location to ending location in grid space model is a solution of algorithm in the process of path searching ants constantly choose an adjacent node for the kth ant on the node x y z the selection probability of next node is determined by the following function 3 3 s k max p i j k j k α t i j k β η i j k i f q q 0 p k i j k o t h e r p k i j k α t i j k β η i j k p i j k j k α t i j k β η i j k i j k i f p i j k j k 0 o t h e r where j k is the set of feasible neighbor nodes of the current node x y z whose maximum neighbor node number is six as previously mentioned q ε 0 1 is a uniform random number q 0 is the proportion of occasions when the greedy selection technique is used t i j k and η i j k are respectively the pheromone intensity and the heuristic information on node i j k α is the weight of the pheromone intensity t i j k and β is the relative importance of the heuristic information η i j k which is stated above other parameters are the same as before 4 3 construction of algorithm individual during population initialization ants choose nodes and searching path according to heuristic information only in the following iteration both heuristic information and pheromone intensity are considered for construction of algorithm individual to avoid node repetition in the process of path searching nodes visited are recorded in dynamically updated table tabu besides based on human computer cooperation theory a certain number of artificial individuals can replace algorithm individuals of same quantity the rules are the following first compare artificial individuals and algorithm individuals in an ergodic mean then exchange path of artificial individuals and algorithm individuals that have the same nodes and if there are multiple identical nodes a node is randomly selected and exchange the exchanged individuals are marked and not available for the rest of the artificial individuals randomly select an algorithm individual available and perform crossover with them by choosing respectively two intermediate nodes from the two paths for ant to generate sub path the process won t stop until all artificial individuals complete crossover process 4 4 local search and heuristic operation because of information feedback algorithm is easy to converge to local optimal solution by performing local search operation in the iaco algorithm searching region is enlarged in an attempt to enhance the quality of the solution converging to global optimal solution in pipe route layout space two methods are proposed to perform local search operation the first way margin is defined as a fixed number of unchanged generation and kmargin is defined as a variable number of unchanged generation if kmargin margin keep iteration otherwise perform mutation operation of local optimal solution converged choose two intermediate nodes from the solution path for ant to generate sub path so that ants get rid of original convergence circle and keep evolving the second way if kmargin margin perform crossover operation on artificial individual and algorithm individual converged in the genetic level crossover operation is introduced in section 4 3 it helps algorithm get rid of local optimal solution range and meanwhile promotes better convergence of artificial individual and algorithm individual in the genetic level moreover designers experience is preserved and utilized in the algorithm interlace operation and heuristic mutation operation is adopted for prd heuristic mutation operations are shown in fig 6 including elbow elimination a obstacle avoidance b and loop elimination c 4 5 pheromone updating rules the quality of pheromone updating is crucial for aco algorithm convergence two updating methods are used for i aco algorithm in sprd the first is local pheromone updating li 2004 update pheromone of nodes that ants have visited it produces discrete solution and improves diversity of solution set the updating rule is defined as follow 4 t t 1 k i j k ρ t t k i j k where t t k i j k t t 1 k i j k is the pheromone intensity of node i j k during t and t 1 iteration of ant k ρ is the pheromone residual parameter the second is global pheromone updating fan et al 2007a b when all of the ants have completed their paths and the local search has been finished the global pheromone updating is employed to all nodes visited this updating process of pheromone is equivalent to offline pheromone trail updating of ant colony system but it is applied to all ants in an iterative mode the rule is described as follows 5 d o t t 1 k i j k ρ t t k i j k ω f t k p w h i l e k m where 6 ω c o n s t 1 i f i j k o p t i m a l p a t h c o n s t 2 i f i j k w o r s t p a t h c o n s t 3 i f o t h e r where ω is a phase constant c o n s t 1 c o n s t 3 c o n s t 2 depends on quality of path f t k p is the fitness value of ant k during t iteration and m is gross of ants 4 6 stopping criterion the optimization algorithm is performed under the condition of human computer cooperation and the two methods can be used as the stopping criterion one is to use the maximum iteration number as the stopping criterion of the algorithm and the other is to use the no evolutionary generations as the stopping criterion take the algorithm which has artificial individuals involved in population initialization for example the flowchart of proposed hcciaco algorithm is shown in fig 7 5 simulation and results two experiments are made in order to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in the first simulation experiment improved ant colony optimization algorithm without artificial solution involved is adopted in the second simulation experiment hcciaco algorithm considering artificial individuals in iaco algorithm to realize human computer cooperation is executed the parameters used are set in table 3 some of the parameters are the traditional parameters of aco fan et al 2007a b the percentage of artificial individuals of the hcciaco algorithm make greater effect on the result of optimization which has been discussed in the section 6 in the simulation experiment sprd search space is cuboid shown in fig 8 diagonal coordinates of the cuboid are 0 0 0 and 50 50 50 in grid space model the cubic cells amount to 50 50 50 six obstacles are within the search space their diagonal coordinates are 6 0 0 and 16 5 50 21 0 0 and 30 5 4 42 10 0 and 50 18 12 42 26 0 and 50 42 12 20 42 0 and 30 50 50 0 15 0 and 9 32 20 14 14 0 and 34 35 21 the start location of ship pipe route is 0 0 0 and the ending location is 50 50 50 each experiment is executed 20 times and the iteration times are 200 compare and analysis of the two algorithm solutions are shown in table 4 because this model is relatively simple its fitness value can be manually determined which is 0 0992 by comparison the solution of hcciaco algorithm is better than pure computer solution of iaco algorithm at avoiding the problem of local optimum and accelerating the convergence rate optimal solution of iaco algorithm without artificial individuals involved is shown in fig 9 the path avoids all obstacles in its process of path searching low energy value region is preferentially chosen pipe route is preferentially set along bulkhead or obstacles surface and no loop occurs in the solution besides 4 elbows are contained in this solution and its fitness value is 0 0978 optimal solution of hcciaco algorithm is shown in fig 10 the artificial individuals added to algorithm individuals during population initialization fitness values range from 0 07 to 0 08 all obstacles are successfully avoided and the number of elbows is 3 which is the theoretical value low energy value region is preferentially chosen meanwhile the fitness value reaches to the theoretical value 0 0992 from above it is easy to see that the proposed hcciaco algorithm has better performance than pure computer algorithm hcciaco algorithm not only improves the convergence speed but also improves the quality of the solution the probability of finding the global optimal solution is greater the solution is to a large extent improved by accelerating algorithm convergence rate and enlarging population convergence proportion with the increasing complexity of space model the superiority of hcciaco algorithm is becoming more evident 6 analysis on addition principles of artificial individuals to fully utilize artificial individual and promote information fusion of artificial individual and algorithm individual addition of artificial individual should follow three principles good timing proper quantity and moderate property of artificial individual in this section these three principles are analyzed respectively from the sprd point of view and space model in fig 8 is adopted the start location is 0 0 0 and the ending location is 50 50 50 6 1 time to join two means for artificial individual addition in hcciaco algorithm are consider the first is to add artificial individuals during population initialization the second is to add artificial individuals when non evolution times reach to fixed generation the percentage of artificial individuals is 20 of total population the fitness values of artificial individuals added range from 0 07 to 0 08 other parameters are listed in table 3 the results are shown in table 5 it is easy to see that the global optimum can be found by the two methods the solution of the first mean has been substantially improved compared to that of pure computer iteration by adding artificial individuals during population initialization while the second means give even better solution by adding artificial individuals when non evolution times reach to fixed generation the reason is that some of good genes of artificial individuals added during population initialization are abandoned by algorithm during the following crossover process the results show that the second mean gives a better solution with high utilization efficiency of artificial individuals 6 2 quantity to join proper quantity of artificial individuals is necessary for too many the algorithm prematurely converges to artificial individual and advantages of algorithm individuals are neglected meanwhile designers share large workload for too few guidance effect of designers is not taken into full play and good genes are easily abandoned during algorithm iteration according to number of artificial individuals the experimental model was used to study the number of artificial individuals accounted for 10 20 30 and 40 respectively from the results shown in fig 11 when artificial individuals account for 20 of total population the algorithm solution reaches to the highest average fitness value 6 3 property to join the property of the adding artificial individual will affect the result of the algorithm in the experiment the number of artificial individuals is 20 and the time of adding is when non evolution times reach to fixed generation the fitness values of the artificial individuals are 0 05 0 06 0 06 0 07 0 07 0 08 and 0 08 0 09 the experimental results are shown in fig 12 for the experimental model the added artificial individuals fitness value is 0 07 0 08 when the added individual performance is too low the degree of improvement of the algorithm is limited when the added individual performance is too high the excellent genes of the algorithm individuals are difficult to be effectively inherited and utilized in the iterative process therefore the performance of the convergence results is closer to the performance of the artificial individuals in addition because this experimental model is relatively simple it is easy to find a good performance of artificial individuals the sprd is very complicated and many factors are considered in the process of arranging the pipeline it is difficult to find the artificial individuals with excellent performance therefore in the process of optimizing the sprd should try to join the high performance of artificial individuals
