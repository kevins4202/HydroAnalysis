13635,since natural apatite has shown a great capacity for phosphorus retention from wastewater a granulated apatite product was developed to control the particle size distribution of the filter material and avoid premature clogging since 2012 twenty full scale granulated apatite filters have been installed in france with the primary aim to remove phosphorus from domestic wastewater measurement campaigns concerning four of these full scale filters were carried out over two years 2017 2018 to assess their performance the maximum retention capacity and phosphorus removal kinetics after several years of operation the filters were selected according to their age and their hydraulic characteristics horizontal flow vertical down flow vertical up flow the maximum phosphorus retention capacity was found to be approximately 7 4 g po4 p kg of granulated apatite the study revealed low kinetic removal rate coefficients it is believed that phosphorus retention occurred by adsorption and precipitation within the porosity of granules since precipitation on the granules surface was not observed by the scanning electron microscopy images therefore under the specific environmental conditions tested the substrate behaves exclusively as an adsorptive like media the increase in ph due to alkalinity release requires the implementation of ph correction for a significant period after the commissioning of the filter 0 5 1 2 years abbreviations bam bohart adams model btc breakthrough curves ca calcium cap calcium phosphate chap carbonated hydroxyapatite cstr

wastewater phosphorus adsorption vertical filter 1 introduction one of the objectives of the european water framework directive 2000 60 ec oj l 327 is to reduce nutrient emissions in order to avoid eutrophication of waterbodies wastewater treatment plants wwtps discharging treated wastewater to ecosystems that are prone to eutrophication must implement specific treatment steps for increased phosphorus p removal in small wwtps conventional phosphorus removal usually requires chemical dosing and advanced technical maintenance the use of a filter especially designed to remove phosphorus may be a more appropriate technology for small wwtps due to the simplicity and low maintenance needs a wide variety of materials have been tested for this purpose 1 2 among which natural apatite has shown a great retention capacity for long term removal 3 like treatment wetlands tws in widespread use in france with over 4000 in operation 4 apatite filters are extensive systems and therefore they can operate combinedly previous studies on the use of natural apatite for phosphorus removal from domestic wastewater reported that a fine particle size distribution may lead to premature clogging of the filter 3 5 consequently a granulated apatite ga product 6 was developed and manufactured using natural apatite and a binder for nearly a decade the granulated apatite was commercialised and used to build 20 full scale filters downstream of existing tw systems in france the operation and retention processes of gaf are based on results obtained in natural apatites on previous works by molle et al 7 and harouiya et al 8 9 phosphorus retention on natural apatite occurs via adsorption and precipitation phenomena the mineral apatite surface acts as a crystal seed catalysing the precipitation of calcium phosphates 3 7 retention kinetics are expected to be high during the commissioning period mostly due to adsorption 3 as reactive adsorption sites deplete precipitation becomes the predominant mechanism which slows down the kinetic rate until a pseudo stabilisation phase is reached 3 in a previous work 10 lab scale experiments on ga using synthetic tap water showed that p was retained by means of adsorption and precipitation on the granules however the removal process changed depending on the calcium concentration and its impact on the supersaturation of the inlet solution with respect to the calcium phosphate phases for low calcium concentration conditions around 70 mg l adsorption and precipitation took place within the granule filling its porosity from a certain depth for higher calcium concentration around 110 mg l precipitation took place at the granules surface where layers of hydroxyapatite hap and carbonated hydroxyapatite chap precipitates superposed onto one another 10 however in real conditions the influence of all the different ions and molecules present in wastewater affect the ionic strength and supersaturation of the solution 11 which may also cause changes in the retention processes taking place this paper presents results from four different tw plants treating p with granulated apatite filters gafs positioned whether as tertiary filter or included in the tw system this study conducted an assessment of mature phosphorus filters particularly in terms of p retention capacity prc performance and kinetics in real conditions intensive measurement campaigns were conducted for two years over four selected apatite filters filters a b and c all commissioned in 2012 were studied to compare performance from different types of filters vertical up flow filter a vertical down flow filter b and horizontal flow filter c a fourth vertical down flow filter filter d was monitored since its commissioning in 2017 to assess the evolution of the effluent s ph due to alkalinity release from the material s binder the study also used historic data from regulatory surveys and self monitoring data main objectives of this work include assessing the current performance of the full scale systems after several years of operation estimating prcs and their kinetic removal rates and assessing the reaction processes taking place in real conditions the study also compares full scale ga filter results with laboratory pilot results presented in delgado gonzález et al 10 2 materials and methods 2 1 characterisation of granulated apatite firstly a physical elemental and mineralogical characterisation of the raw granulated apatite was carried out using technics as the powder x ray diffraction inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy and optical emission spectroscopy as well as by scanning electron microscopy equipped with an electron backscattered diffraction pattern detector a full description of the characterisation techniques applied on the granulated apatite substrate can be found in delgado gonzález et al 10 the specific surface area ssa was determined by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms bet method using an asap 2020 m the porosity was determined using the standard soil science procedure based on estimations of bulk density and particle density 12 and calculated as described in eq 1 the bulk density ρb was measured by the volume of a dry sample occupied by a known mass of material n 3 and the specific density ρ s by the pycnometer method nf en iso 11508 may 2014 n 3 1 p o r o s i t y 1 ρ b ρ s the mineral composition of the granules was found to be 79 1 w w over the crystallized masse total crystallinity 80 carbonated fluorapatite 12 4 calcite 4 8 quartz and 3 1 dolomite elemental content comprises 32 5 ca w w 11 8 p 2 4 si 2 2 f 0 8 s and other metals as na k mg al fe with a content below 0 5 the granulated apatite 2 8 5 d10 d60 has a specific density of 2 9 g cm3 and a specific surface area of 32 m2 g bet method the porosity of the filtering bed is 49 2 2 full scale granulated apatite filters four granulated apatite filters treating wastewaters of small and medium size communities of france 5000 pe were selected to carry out intensive measurement campaigns over two years the gafs are hydraulically saturated to increase the hydraulic residence time hrt and thus to facilitate a close contact between phosphates and the filtration material 3 to avoid clogging by suspended solids and excessive biomass development the filters can be placed downstream of the treatment wetland or within the wetland in a second or third treatment stage selection of the gafs was based on the age of the filter and the hydraulic regime since long term retention occurs via precipitation the three older gafs in operation commissioned in 2012 were selected filters a b and c these three filters are filled with the same ga production batch exact same average composition to avoid the influence of variations of the granules composition in the results this would allow to compare the operation of the filters in terms of performance prc and retention kinetics while each filter implements a different hydraulic regime vertical up flow vertical down flow horizontal flow at the commissioning period ph can be high induced by lime dissolution from the granules binder therefore a new gaf filter d was included in the study in order to assess the ph dynamics during the start up table 1 and fig 1 collect the main characteristics of the selected filters 2 3 measurement campaigns the study used data from regulatory surveys carried out from the commissioning of the treatment systems however since the treatment plants do not have the same capacity the number of regulatory surveys was heterogeneous and not enough to perform a precise estimation of saturation levels and retention kinetics therefore intensive measurement campaigns were required to complete the assessment four day intensive measurement campaigns were conducted twice a year for each filter these campaigns included 24h flow proportional sampling at the inlet and outlet of the gaf in order to evaluate p retention online po4 p measurements at the outlet of the filter were carried out with a trescon wtw analyser to monitor possible dynamics within a day sampling was also conducted out at different locations inside the filter corresponding to different hydraulic retention times hrts in order to estimate p retention kinetics the analyses of the samples included ph measurements with a phmeter mettler toledo conductivity with a conductometer mettler toledo redox potential using a probe sensolyt 700iq xylem tss bod5 and cod according to the norms nf en 872 nf en 1899 1 and nf t 90 101 respectively tp was measured by icp oes and major anions cations ca2 mg2 po4 p by ionic chromatography nf en iso 14911 and en iso 10304 1 and hco3 co3 2 by the titrimetric analytic method nf en iso 9963 1 for filter d the evolution of ph was monitored for several months following the start up with a flowmeter bubble tube isco and an online ph sensor secomam wtw varion at the inlet and outlet of the filter 2 4 hydraulic performance 2 4 1 tracer test to assess hydraulic performance dirac fluorescein tracer tests were carried out with a ggun fl30 fluorometer to precisely determine water retention times and the occurrence of any flow disturbance short circuiting dead volumes etc which would ultimately allow a better evaluation of the kinetic rates the characteristics of the tracer tests for each filter are given in table 2 a tracer test is characterised by a distribution of hydraulic retention times defined by the e t function eq 2 in this study the retention distribution curve e t vs t was evaluated using the tank in series hydraulic model which produces a gamma distribution eq 3 2 e t q t c t 0 q t c t d t 3 e t n t e x p г n n t t e x p n 1 e x p n t t e x p 4 t e x p t 0 t e t d t where q m3 h is the flowrate c g m3 or mg l is the tracer concentration at the outlet of the system n is the number of complete stirred tanks in series ad t h is time texp h is the experimental hydraulic retention time hrt which is the mean retention time of the distribution curve eq 4 and г n h 1 is the gamma function the solver tool in excel is used to determine texp and n while minimizing the difference between observed and estimated values of the retention distribution curve 13 the hydraulic efficiency e is evaluated using the expression in eq 5 values lower than 1 00 indicate the presence of dead volumes the spread of the distribution curve with respect to the mean hrt is the variance σ2 h2 defined in eq 6 the greater the variance the more different velocities of water are present in the filter 5 e v e f f e c t i v e v t o t a l t e x p t n 6 σ 2 t 0 t t e x p 2 e t d t where tn h is the nominal or theoretical hrt 2 4 2 dynamic penetration tests finally dynamic cone penetration tests were carried out panda to measure the resistance to penetration shear strength of the granulated apatite this technique allows the determination of density variations of the media due to disaggregation of the granules or media compaction because of surface precipitation its combination with tracer testing gives a more comprehensive overview of the state of the filtration bed which may eventually identify the occurrence of dead zones and shortcuts 2 5 analytical microscopy grab sampling of the filter material was also performed to assess precipitate formation by scanning electron microscopy sem the aim was to observe if precipitation was able to form or not on the surface of the granules and to compare such observations with those obtained in a previous work with granulated apatite experiments in laboratory columns delgado gonzález et al 10 the study also assess the influence of real wastewater in phosphorus retention sem micrographs of the surface of apatite granules were performed with a sem efg xl30 philips microscope 2 6 evaluation of retention capacity by simple modelling due to the scattered performance data over the long period of operation for each filter precise modelling is not feasible nevertheless simple models can be used to estimate and discuss the retention capacity of the granulated apatite in real conditions compared to more accurate data in column experiments of a previous work 10 therefore two different approaches were explored in this study sorption models and a first order kinetic model 2 6 1 sorption models the first approach considered the evaluation of breakthrough curves btcs through fix bed sorption models a btc represents the evolution of the effluent pollutant concentration with the elapsed time allowing the determination of the maximum sorption capacity of the substrate by using sorption models fixed bed sorption models are based on equilibrium isotherms axial dispersion diffusion resistances and reaction kinetics 14 common models include the thomas model tm the bohart adams model bam the yoon and nelson model ynm the modified dose response model mdrm and the clark model 14 the tm and bam usually characterise well systems where the surface reaction is the rate limiting step of the whole sorption process however together with the ynm the tm and bam are equivalent models from a mathematical point of view 15 16 and their parameters are interconnected thus multiple models are not needed for the analysis of a single data set the sole use of the bam is recommended by lee kim 17 on the other hand the application of the clark model equation requires the use of a parameter from the freundlich isotherm model which was not assessed in this study as a result the selected models for the analyses of the experimental data of full scale gaf in real conditions were the bam and the mdrm table 3 bam 18 this model assumes a proportional relationship between the adsorption rate and both the remaining capacity of the adsorbent and the solute concentration mdrm 19 is an empirical model that reduces the error between the experimental data and the prediction of the thomas model especially for very short or very long operation times the tm combines the langmuir kinetic model with a second order reversible reaction and plug flow hydraulic regime no axial dispersion this study used the linearized and non linearized expressions of the selected models to fit the data the adequacy of the models was evaluated and compared in regards to the sum of square errors sse the coefficient of determination r2 and the chi square coefficient x2 17 20 21 7 s s e i 1 m y e y c i 2 8 r 2 i 1 m y c y e i 2 i 1 m y c y e i 2 i 1 m y c y e i 2 9 x 2 i 1 m y e y c 2 y c i where yc is the predicted data obtained from the model ye is the experimental data and y e is the average of experimental data 2 6 2 the n k c model data was also confronted to the n k c model 13 the model considers n complete stirred tank reactors cstr in series with a first order kinetics the reaction is described by the kv parameter the kinetic rate coefficient k which does not depend on the hydraulic loading rate or the inlet concentration 22 the model also uses the concept of a background or residual concentration c which applied to p retention onto apatites could account for an equilibrium concentration derived from adsorption and precipitation processes thus the evolution of p concentration at the outlet of the system c with the hrt t is obtained by the expression in eq 10 according to the n k c model 10 c c 0 c 1 k v t n n c where c0 is the inlet concentration of phosphorus n is the number of cstr in series kv the volumetric kinetic rate coefficient and c the p equilibrium concentration background concentration the parameters of the model kv and c are estimated from kinetic studies by fitting the evolution of p concentration inside the filter at different hrts the n parameter is determined from tracer tests 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydraulic performance in order to identify flow heterogeneities and dead zones tracer tests were carried out for all the filters data was analysed using a tank in series tis hydraulic model with a gamma distribution of retention times table 4 shows a summary of the tracer test results the associated tracer curves can be found in the supplementary material fig s 1 the filters are in agreement with tis hydraulic model with n going from 4 6 to 6 2 reactors the latter belonging to filter a highest n value for filter b the goodness of the fitting is extremely low because the influent is highly scattered in time several hours and a bell shape distribution curve cannot be obtained this must be taken into account on the following when interpreting the kinetic parameters and the phosphorus retention capacity based on n and the dead zones here determined dispersion values are quite moderate except for the horizontal filter filter c the analysis of the hydraulic performance leads to other observations according to the hydraulic regime 3 1 1 vertical filters the presence of high to moderate dead zones was identified by tracer test regardless of flow direction up flow or down flow since the mass of tracer recovered was lower than 80 for filters a and d the results must be interpreted with care however visual observations corroborated the presence of some hydraulic anomalies and pointed out the importance of the even hydraulic distribution in vertical granulated apatite filters water distribution and recovery systems must be well designed in order to limit dead zones in filter d down flow the lack of a superficial ponding water and insufficient distribution ramps do not allow a good water distribution over the entire surface of the filter water infiltrates close to the distribution pipes and moves vertically to the outlet resulting in an important short circuit in the tracer curve fig s 1 d for filter a up flow vertical filter which has a ponding zone the dead zone can be attributed to heterogeneities in the water flow due to deficiencies in the collector systems filter b showed some heterogeneity in the cross section of the bed during penetrometry tests which may have led to the appearance of dead volumes the material density increased progressively with the depth of the filter as shown in fig 2 b since the filter is by passed and drained during the winter period crystallization phenomena onto the apatite surface can be exacerbated effectively gluing the granules to one another this compaction at some levels of the filtering bed may have led to water flow disruptions and bed heterogeneities 3 1 2 horizontal filter planted with phragmites australis for filter c no dead volume was identified but a short circuit at the beginning of the tracer test was observed see fig s 1 c supplementary material visual observation confirmed surface flow at different locations it is thus possible that hydraulic conductivity decreased with time due to organic matter accumulation development of phragmites or the evolution of the ga density compaction degradation such flow heterogeneity within the media was as well confirmed by internal spot samplings which revealed important differences in p concentrations at locations of the filter with the same theoretical hrt due to the large surface of the filter and the distribution system implemented large central distribution ramps with not enough maintenance flow distribution and flow pathways inside the filter bed are highly heterogeneous leading to high performance variations inside the filter the lack of a homogeneous flow distribution is also caused by heterogeneities in the material density penetrometer measurements together with direct observation revealed compaction solidification and disaggregation of the granules at different locations within the filter those disturbances of the media density at depths in between 10 and 30 cm from surface see fig s 2 supplementary material might be attributed to variably hydraulic saturation conditions that could have dried the more superficial layers and favoured crystallisation indeed despite the filter was supposed to operate hydraulically saturated it was often found to be partially unsaturated during the campaigns 3 2 evolution of ph monitoring of filter d from its commissioning showed a dramatic increase of the effluent ph such ph increase is mostly due to lime dissolution from the cement binder of the granulated apatite in contact with water which releases hydroxyl ions into the effluent as represented in eq 11 2 11 c a o h 2 o c a 2 2 o h the calcite layer above the apatite may also help keeping a basic ph for a longer time fig 3 shows the evolution of ph with the amount of effluent passed per volume of filter ph drops below the upper regulatory threshold of 8 5 ph units after 100 m3 of water per m3 of filter or 420 m3 m3 when dead zones are considered since high ph values in wwtps effluents can endanger aquatic ecosystems a ph correction of the plant s effluent must be implemented during significant periods after the commissioning of the filter from months to around a year according to the design of the filter lime dissolution also affects supersaturation of the solution by increasing the ca2 concentration high ph and supersaturation levels should promote the precipitation of calcium phosphates and calcium carbonates calcium dissolution and ph increase can be also responsible for high kinetic rates in gaf right after the commissioning there may be some counterproductive effects the formation of a carbonated layer on the surface of the ga may prevent cap retention and may accelerate the compaction of the material leading to a decrease of the hydraulic conductivity 3 3 phosphorus retention performances prc phosphorus retention efficiency depends on the cumulated p load retained by a particular filter performance results can be represented in terms of prc to calculate the saturation level data from the historical performance of regulatory surveys and data from measurement campaigns was used since regulatory data often concerned just inlet and outlet concentrations of the wwtp and not from ga filter specifically an estimation of the performance evolution was carried out these estimations were based on several criteria phosphate po4 p concentration at the outlet of the filter is determined from total phosphorus tp measurements by applying an average particulate phosphorus pp to total suspended solids tss ratio obtained during measurement campaigns pp tss 0 01 when the filter is on second stage filter c p concentration at the outlet of the filter is assimilated to the p concentration at the outlet of the wwtp as po4 p since no significant retention of p is expected to occur on the third stage of treatment the mean inlet po4 p concentration of measurement campaigns for a particular filter is used when no data are available finally estimations are carried out considering a constant mean flow rate based on all available data the application of these criteria entails indeed a high level of uncertainty resulting in a high variability of the estimations that must be considered for results interpretation the characteristics of the inflow for the three filters a b and c are presented in table s1 of the supplementary material by representing the evolution of the retained p as a function of the cumulative load received by the filters the maximum retention capacity of ga in real conditions can be discussed fig 4 shows similar initial retention trends for low cumulative p loads in all filters nevertheless the evolution of the performance of the filter with increasing cumulative load can only be seen for filter a a reduction of the filter efficiency is observed at around 3 5 g po4 p retained kg material attaining an asymptotic trend at 4 0 g po4 p kg material when the estimated dead volume dv is considered the maximum prc is attained at 7 4 g po4 p kg material p in a reduced reactor volume fig 4 a several factors may significantly affect prc estimations like the presence of dead zones as well as the uncertainties associated with flow rates and the inlet concentrations for instance to consider the impact of inlet concentration assumptions the standard deviation of the mean inlet concentration can be used as shown in fig 4 b for filter a this highlights the great variability of prc estimations due to the uncertainty associated with the low regulatory surveys frequency the evolution of prc is also compared with the results of the experiment conducted in a laboratory scale filter with synthetic water under controlled conditions column 1 from delgado gonzález et al 10 the drop in p retention yield is observed at prc values higher than those obtained under real conditions the differences may be due to the uncertainties associated with the hypothesis applied for the estimations in full scale systems but also the consequences of the impact of real wastewater characteristics on chemical reaction in this sense two major aspects may negatively affect p retention in full scale systems the biomass development onto the surface of the filter material 9 and the influence of several different ions present in the effluent on the chemical reaction it has been reported that the concentration and type of organic molecules and inorganics salts present in the effluent produce different aqueous solvation environments which may affect differently the precipitation processes and kinetics even when comparing solutions with the same ionic strength 11 it is worth noting that when considering the dead volume and the uncertainty on the input concentration the estimation can bring the saturation curve close to the one obtained in laboratory conditions fig 4 b 3 4 kinetic rates of p retention in full scale systems the calculation of the reaction kinetics can be assessed based on input output concentrations or by internal sampling along the hydraulic retention time the calibration of model parameters for both types of sampling data implies however different issues when defining kv values on average input output data a strong uncertainty in kv is observed for outlet concentrations close to c on the other hand when the outlet concentration is high c cannot be estimated correctly a more precise estimation of the model parameters is possible by monitoring the evolution of p concentration at the bulk of the filter by internal sampling nevertheless heterogeneous flows within the media can induce uncertainties as well consequently the model parameters are here discussed only as an order of magnitude and compared to the experiments done in controlled conditions 10 fig 5 shows kinetic rate coefficients estimated by internal sampling during the intensive campaigns the evolution of kv with the prc obtained in a laboratory column with synthetic water is also plotted for comparison fig 5 provides an example of how the model was fitted to the experimental data to determine the model parameters kv and c the nonlinear grg generalized reduced gradient solver method was used for the calculations the hydraulic efficiency of the filters was taken into consideration for the estimations all filters showed low kinetic rate coefficients in most cases below the ones determined for the laboratory column although it can be assumed that results remain in the same order of magnitude kv from lab column experiments 1 h 1 the differences are likely related with the uncertainties associated to the historical data and the flow heterogeneities in the bulk of the filter that cannot be taken into consideration a mean flowrate is used but the measurements are localized in a specific point of the filter in addition the implementation of the reactions in real conditions wastewater instead of synthetic water can also affect the kinetic rates differently from laboratory experiments with synthetic solutions 3 11 the model parameters evolve with the prc which is not homogeneous in the bulk of the filter the media layers close to the feeding would normally have greater amounts of p retained than those layers close to the outlet of the filter this may result in differences in kv and c values as a function of hrt inside the filter this was indeed the case of filter a up flow during the first campaign where the first 50 cm of the filter were hardly reactive with a kv of approximately 0 09 h 1 the last 50 cm of the filter was still actively retaining p at relatively high kinetic rates kv 1 3 h 1 an average kv value was calculated for the entire filter localised flow heterogeneities inside the filter can also lead to differences in the estimated parameters for instance variations of kv were observed in filters a or d for the same prc on the other hand the extremely low values of filter c are derived from a large hrt since a significant reduction in p concentration is still observed see table s 2 of supplementary material 3 5 adsorption models previous results have showed a relatively rapid loss of performance of the gaf leading to the supposition that the material may behaved more as an adsorptive substrate than a seed to promote precipitation the precipitates filling the internal porosity of the granules may behave as an adsorptive like process where the filling indicates the end of the sorption capacity consequently fixed bed adsorption models were used to assess the evolution of output concentrations with time due to limited data concerning the other filters and their lower prc attained estimations using the adsorption models were only possible for filter a the calculations considered constant flow rate 53 m3 day constant inlet concentration mean value 4 4 mg po4 p l and 45 of dead zones the bohart adams model bam and the modified dose response model msrm were used and compared with experimental data fig 6 in both cases the non linear regressions of the models showed to be in better agreement with experimental data than linear regressions table 5 among the non linear expressions the goodness of the fitting is slightly better for the mdrm despite previous results on the hydraulics performance showed that the system does not behave as a plug flow reactor the mdrm is an empirical model especially adapted for very long experimental times as the case of this study by using fixed bed models one can also predict the maximum phosphorus retention capacity of the system this was 8 0 and 7 0 g po4 p kg ga according to the non linear regressions of the mdrm and bam respectively the predictions are in agreement with results shown in fig 4 b the objective of this analysis was not to give an in depth assessment of sorption mechanisms but to be able to correlate the behaviour of the gaf with those associated with sorption systems in this sense based on the given results it can be assumed that filter a behaved as an adsorptive media under the particular solution conditions of the system 3 6 retention processes in delgado gonzález et al 10 it was found that p retention occurred in two different ways depending on calcium concentration and its impact on the supersaturation of the solution with respect to cap solid phases hydroxyapatite hap as the referent precipitate for low ca concentrations around 70 mg l the ions were able to diffuse through the internal porosity of the granules adsorbing and then precipitating within the pores this would eventually clog their internal porosity from a depth of 100 300 μm from the surface once precipitates reach the surface of the granule the reaction would not occur at a sufficient rate lower specific surface area leading to a decrease of the retention performance for solutions with higher ca concentration around 110 mg l supersaturation allowed heterogeneous precipitation onto the surface of the granules leading to superposed layers of carbonated hap precipitates that can theoretically grow until the porosity of the gaf clogs the supersaturation of a solution with respect to a particular solid phase can be assessed through the saturation index si defined by the expression in eq 12 it depends in temperature the ionic strength of the solution and the concentration of the constitutive elements of the solid phase in solution 12 s i log i a p k s p log i a i v i i a i v i e q where iap is the ionic activity product ksp is the solubility product constant a i is the activity of the ith constitutive element of the solid in solution v i is the stoichiometric number for the ith element and eq indicates chemical equilibrium the supersaturation conditions of full scale gaf were assessed to help identifying the process involved in p retention with real wastewater the saturation indexes si of the influent were calculated using phreeqc 23 see tables s 3 6 of the supplementary material table 6 shows the supersaturation characteristics of the influent in filter a revealing supersaturated conditions with respect to cap phases as tricalcium phosphate tcp octocalcium phosphate ocp and hydroxyapatite hap but also with carbonated compounds as calcite and dolomite the sis in particular for hap are lower but closer to the influent characteristics of column 1 of delgado gonzález et al 10 where the adsorption and precipitation occurred inside the granules such results would explain the low kinetic rates observed in fig 5 in order to assess the similarity of the retention processes in full scale systems with those observed in the laboratory columns scanning electron microscopy sem images were carried out on samples of the filtration bed for filters a b and c the micrographs revealed a porous surface with a morphology close to that of a raw granule in all the cases some traces of crystalline particles were also observed on the surface of the granules but a precipitate layer wrapping the granules was not present as it was observed in delgado gonzález et al 10 the mentioned difference can be understand from the comparison of both images of fig 7 the fig 7 a shows a porous surface with some residues and crystalline particles from a granule in filter b the appearance of the surface of the granules from the other filters was also similar to that of fig 7 a see fig s 4 of supplementary material in fig 7 b a micrograph of a sample taken from the laboratory column fed with a high calcium concentration is shown 10 a completely different morphology of the surface is clearly observed a deposit layer formed onto the granule which was identified as a carbonated hap in delgado gonzález et al 8 therefore concerning samples from the full scale filters there are no elements indicating an effective precipitation of calcium phosphates at the surface of the granules in conclusion it appears that p retention is carried out in a similar way as in the low supersaturated solutions of the laboratory scale filters the retention dynamics could be then assimilated to a sorption process rather than a precipitation process reason why data correlates relatively well with adsorption models the major differences in p retention performance and kinetics with respect to column experiments are 1 the scaling up effect which would account for a reduction in the hydraulic performance 2 the impact of the ion concentration and organic and inorganic molecules on the supersaturation of the solution 3 the reduction of the available surface area due to the adsorption of organic molecules and or the development of biomass on the granules 4 conclusions the assessment of full scale gaf has highlighted some critical issues that should be considered in the design and implementation of these systems in terms of the hydraulic performance the use of several different measures and techniques tracer tests penetrometer measurements and spot samplings has determined the presence of dead volumes in all the four filters in this study since the horizontal configuration led to important heterogeneities in the media and in the water flow a vertical filter with a permanent water ponding appears to be a better configuration ensuring the hydraulic saturation of the filter nevertheless special attention should be paid in the conception and installation of the hydraulic distribution and collection system to avoid the presence of dead zones the maximum prc of a full scale gaf under real conditions was estimated in 7 4 g po4 p kg based on the evolution of the prc of filter a and considering the presence of dead zones depending on the specific characteristics of the filter and the wastewater this translates into an effective filter life of five to six years however the lack of historical data has introduced important uncertainties to the estimations thus maximum prc may vary from 4 6 to 10 7 g po4 p kg of ga the prc determined for full scale apatite filters is consistent with results from laboratory columns prc approximately 10 g po4 p kg the kv values for full scale gaf are generally lower but close to those obtained for the lab scale experiments in delgado gonzález et al 10 the flow heterogeneities and the influence of wastewater can be responsible of such differences the uncertainties associated with the determination of the prc can also play a significant role in the results obtained the simulation of si and the observation of sem micrographs of the surface of the granules has allows to say that p retention takes places by adsorption and precipitation within the porosity of granule any sustainable precipitation does initiate at the surface as a result the behaviour of the system can be estimated with a sorption process finally the monitoring of the ph for filter d has shown a significant increase of the ph of the effluent approximately 420 m3 of water per cubic meter of filter were needed to reduce ph to the regulatory limits when considering dead zones declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

13635,since natural apatite has shown a great capacity for phosphorus retention from wastewater a granulated apatite product was developed to control the particle size distribution of the filter material and avoid premature clogging since 2012 twenty full scale granulated apatite filters have been installed in france with the primary aim to remove phosphorus from domestic wastewater measurement campaigns concerning four of these full scale filters were carried out over two years 2017 2018 to assess their performance the maximum retention capacity and phosphorus removal kinetics after several years of operation the filters were selected according to their age and their hydraulic characteristics horizontal flow vertical down flow vertical up flow the maximum phosphorus retention capacity was found to be approximately 7 4 g po4 p kg of granulated apatite the study revealed low kinetic removal rate coefficients it is believed that phosphorus retention occurred by adsorption and precipitation within the porosity of granules since precipitation on the granules surface was not observed by the scanning electron microscopy images therefore under the specific environmental conditions tested the substrate behaves exclusively as an adsorptive like media the increase in ph due to alkalinity release requires the implementation of ph correction for a

wastewater phosphorus adsorption vertical filter 1 introduction one of the objectives of the european water framework directive 2000 60 ec oj l 327 is to reduce nutrient emissions in order to avoid eutrophication of waterbodies wastewater treatment plants wwtps discharging treated wastewater to ecosystems that are prone to eutrophication must implement specific treatment steps for increased phosphorus p removal in small wwtps conventional phosphorus removal usually requires chemical dosing and advanced technical maintenance the use of a filter especially designed to remove phosphorus may be a more appropriate technology for small wwtps due to the simplicity and low maintenance needs a wide variety of materials have been tested for this purpose 1 2 among which natural apatite has shown a great retention capacity for long term removal 3 like treatment wetlands tws in widespread use in france with over 4000 in operation 4 apatite filters are extensive systems and therefore they can operate combinedly previous studies on the use of natural apatite for phosphorus removal from domestic wastewater reported that a fine particle size distribution may lead to premature clogging of the filter 3 5 consequently a granulated apatite ga product 6 was developed and manufactured using natural apatite and a binder for nearly a decade the granulated apatite was commercialised and used to build 20 full scale filters downstream of existing tw systems in france the operation and retention processes of gaf are based on results obtained in natural apatites on previous works by molle et al 7 and harouiya et al 8 9 phosphorus retention on natural apatite occurs via adsorption and precipitation phenomena the mineral apatite surface acts as a crystal seed catalysing the precipitation of calcium phosphates 3 7 retention kinetics are expected to be high during the commissioning period mostly due to adsorption 3 as reactive adsorption sites deplete precipitation becomes the predominant mechanism which slows down the kinetic rate until a pseudo stabilisation phase is reached 3 in a previous work 10 lab scale experiments on ga using synthetic tap water showed that p was retained by means of adsorption and precipitation on the granules however the removal process changed depending on the calcium concentration and its impact on the supersaturation of the inlet solution with respect to the calcium phosphate phases for low calcium concentration conditions around 70 mg l adsorption and precipitation took place within the granule filling its porosity from a certain depth for higher calcium concentration around 110 mg l precipitation took place at the granules surface where layers of hydroxyapatite hap and carbonated hydroxyapatite chap precipitates superposed onto one another 10 however in real conditions the influence of all the different ions and molecules present in wastewater affect the ionic strength and supersaturation of the solution 11 which may also cause changes in the retention processes taking place this paper presents results from four different tw plants treating p with granulated apatite filters gafs positioned whether as tertiary filter or included in the tw system this study conducted an assessment of mature phosphorus filters particularly in terms of p retention capacity prc performance and kinetics in real conditions intensive measurement campaigns were conducted for two years over four selected apatite filters filters a b and c all commissioned in 2012 were studied to compare performance from different types of filters vertical up flow filter a vertical down flow filter b and horizontal flow filter c a fourth vertical down flow filter filter d was monitored since its commissioning in 2017 to assess the evolution of the effluent s ph due to alkalinity release from the material s binder the study also used historic data from regulatory surveys and self monitoring data main objectives of this work include assessing the current performance of the full scale systems after several years of operation estimating prcs and their kinetic removal rates and assessing the reaction processes taking place in real conditions the study also compares full scale ga filter results with laboratory pilot results presented in delgado gonzález et al 10 2 materials and methods 2 1 characterisation of granulated apatite firstly a physical elemental and mineralogical characterisation of the raw granulated apatite was carried out using technics as the powder x ray diffraction inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy and optical emission spectroscopy as well as by scanning electron microscopy equipped with an electron backscattered diffraction pattern detector a full description of the characterisation techniques applied on the granulated apatite substrate can be found in delgado gonzález et al 10 the specific surface area ssa was determined by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms bet method using an asap 2020 m the porosity was determined using the standard soil science procedure based on estimations of bulk density and particle density 12 and calculated as described in eq 1 the bulk density ρb was measured by the volume of a dry sample occupied by a known mass of material n 3 and the specific density ρ s by the pycnometer method nf en iso 11508 may 2014 n 3 1 p o r o s i t y 1 ρ b ρ s the mineral composition of the granules was found to be 79 1 w w over the crystallized masse total crystallinity 80 carbonated fluorapatite 12 4 calcite 4 8 quartz and 3 1 dolomite elemental content comprises 32

m2 g bet method the porosity of the filtering bed is 49 2 2 full scale granulated apatite filters four granulated apatite filters treating wastewaters of small and medium size communities of france 5000 pe were selected to carry out intensive measurement campaigns over two years the gafs are hydraulically saturated to increase the hydraulic residence time hrt and thus to facilitate a close contact between phosphates and the filtration material 3 to avoid clogging by suspended solids and excessive biomass development the filters can be placed downstream of the treatment wetland or within the wetland in a second or third treatment stage selection of the gafs was based on the age of the filter and the hydraulic regime since long term retention occurs via precipitation the three older gafs in operation commissioned in 2012 were selected filters a b and c these three filters are filled with the same ga production batch exact same average composition to avoid the influence of variations of the granules composition in the results this would allow to compare the operation of the filters in terms of performance prc and retention kinetics while each filter implements a different hydraulic regime vertical up flow vertical down flow horizontal flow at the commissioning period ph can be high induced by lime dissolution from the granules binder therefore a new gaf filter d was included in the study in order to assess the ph dynamics during the start up table 1 and fig 1 collect the main characteristics of the selected filters 2 3 measurement campaigns the study used data from regulatory surveys carried out from the commissioning of the treatment systems however since the treatment plants do not have the same capacity the number of regulatory surveys was heterogeneous and not enough to perform a precise estimation of saturation levels and retention kinetics therefore intensive measurement campaigns were required to complete the assessment four day intensive measurement campaigns were conducted twice a year for each filter these campaigns included 24h flow proportional sampling at the inlet and outlet of the gaf in order to evaluate p retention online po4 p measurements at the outlet of the filter were carried out with a trescon wtw analyser to monitor possible dynamics within a day sampling was also conducted out at different locations inside the filter corresponding to different hydraulic retention times hrts in order to estimate p retention kinetics the analyses of the samples included ph measurements with a phmeter mettler toledo conductivity with a conductometer mettler toledo redox potential using a probe sensolyt 700iq xylem tss bod5 and cod according to the norms nf en 872 nf en 1899 1 and nf t 90 101 respectively tp was measured by icp oes and major anions cations ca2 mg2 po4 p by ionic chromatography nf en iso 14911 and en iso 10304 1 and hco3 co3 2 by the titrimetric analytic method nf en iso 9963 1 for filter d the evolution of ph was monitored for several months following the start up with a flowmeter bubble tube isco and an online ph sensor secomam wtw varion at the inlet and outlet of the filter 2 4 hydraulic performance 2 4 1 tracer test to assess hydraulic performance dirac fluorescein tracer tests were carried out with a ggun fl30 fluorometer to precisely determine water retention times and the occurrence of any flow disturbance short circuiting dead volumes etc which would ultimately allow a better evaluation of the kinetic rates the characteristics of the tracer tests for each filter are given in table 2 a tracer test is characterised by a distribution of hydraulic retention times defined by the e t function eq 2 in this study the retention distribution curve e t vs t was evaluated using the tank in series hydraulic model which produces a gamma distribution eq 3 2 e t q t c t 0 q t c t d t 3 e t n t e x p г n n t t e x p n 1 e x p n t t e x p 4 t e x p t 0 t e t d t where q m3 h is the flowrate c g m3 or mg l is the tracer concentration at the outlet of the system n is the number of complete stirred tanks in series ad t h is time texp h is the experimental hydraulic retention time hrt which is the mean retention time of the distribution curve eq 4 and г n h 1 is the gamma function the solver tool in excel is used to determine texp and n while minimizing the difference between observed and estimated values of the retention distribution curve 13 the hydraulic efficiency e is evaluated using the expression in eq 5 values lower than 1 00 indicate the presence of dead volumes the spread of the distribution curve with respect to the mean hrt is the variance σ2 h2 defined in eq 6 the greater the variance the more different velocities of water are present in the filter 5 e v e f f e c t i v e v t o t a l t e x p t n 6 σ 2 t 0 t t e x p 2 e t d t where tn h is the nominal or theoretical hrt 2 4 2 dynamic penetration tests finally dynamic cone penetration tests were carried out panda to measure the resistance to penetration shear strength of the granulated apatite this technique allows the determination of density variations of the media due to disaggregation of the granules or media compaction because of surface precipitation its combination with tracer testing gives a more comprehensive overview of the state of the filtration bed which may eventually identify the occurrence of dead zones and shortcuts 2 5 analytical microscopy grab sampling of the filter material was also performed to assess precipitate formation by scanning electron microscopy sem the aim was to observe if precipitation was able to form or not on the surface of the granules and to compare such observations with those obtained in a previous work with granulated apatite experiments in laboratory columns delgado gonzález et al 10 the study also assess the influence of real wastewater in phosphorus retention sem micrographs of the surface of apatite granules were performed with a sem efg xl30 philips microscope 2 6 evaluation of retention capacity by simple modelling due to the scattered performance data over the long period of operation for each filter precise modelling is not feasible nevertheless simple models can be used to estimate and discuss the retention capacity of the granulated apatite in real conditions compared to more accurate data in column experiments of a previous work 10 therefore two different approaches were explored in this study sorption models and a first order kinetic model 2 6 1 sorption models the first approach considered the evaluation of breakthrough curves btcs through fix bed sorption models a btc represents the evolution of the effluent pollutant concentration with the elapsed time allowing the determination of the maximum sorption capacity of the substrate by using sorption models fixed bed sorption models are based on equilibrium isotherms axial dispersion diffusion resistances and reaction kinetics 14 common models include the thomas model tm the bohart adams model bam the yoon and nelson model ynm the modified dose response model mdrm and the clark model 14 the tm and bam usually characterise well systems where the surface reaction is the rate limiting step of the whole sorption process however together with the ynm the tm and bam are equivalent models from a mathematical point of view 15 16 and their parameters are interconnected thus multiple models are not needed for the analysis of a single data set the sole use of the bam is recommended by lee kim 17 on the other hand the application of the clark model equation requires the use of a parameter from the freundlich isotherm model which was not assessed in this study as a result the selected models for the analyses of the experimental data of full scale gaf in real conditions were the bam and the mdrm table 3 bam 18 this model assumes a proportional relationship between the adsorption rate and both the remaining capacity of the adsorbent and the solute concentration mdrm 19 is an empirical model that reduces the error between the experimental data and the prediction of the thomas model especially for very short or very long operation times the tm combines the langmuir kinetic model with a second order reversible reaction and plug flow hydraulic regime no axial dispersion this study used the linearized and non linearized expressions of the selected models to fit the data the adequacy of the models was evaluated and compared in regards to the sum of square errors sse the coefficient of determination r2 and the chi square coefficient x2 17 20 21 7 s s e i 1 m y e y c i 2 8 r 2 i 1 m y c y e i 2 i 1 m y c y e i 2 i 1 m y c y e i 2 9 x 2 i 1 m y e y c 2 y c i where yc is the predicted data obtained from the model ye is the experimental data and y e is the average of experimental data 2 6 2 the n k c model data was also confronted to the n k c model 13 the model considers n complete stirred tank reactors cstr in series with a first order kinetics the reaction is described by the kv parameter the kinetic rate coefficient k which does not depend on the hydraulic loading rate or the inlet concentration 22 the model also uses the concept of a background or residual concentration c which applied to p retention onto apatites could account for an equilibrium concentration derived from adsorption and precipitation processes thus the evolution of p concentration at the outlet of the system c with the hrt t is obtained by the expression in eq 10 according to the n k c model 10 c c 0 c 1 k v t n n c where c0 is the inlet concentration of phosphorus n is the number of cstr in series kv the volumetric kinetic rate coefficient and c the p equilibrium concentration background concentration the parameters of the model kv and c are estimated from kinetic studies by fitting the evolution of p concentration inside the filter at different hrts the n parameter is determined from tracer tests 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydraulic performance in order to identify flow heterogeneities and dead zones tracer tests were carried out for all the filters data was analysed using a tank in series tis hydraulic model with a gamma distribution of retention times table 4 shows a summary of the tracer test results the associated tracer curves can be found in the supplementary material fig s 1 the filters are in agreement with tis hydraulic model with n going from 4 6 to 6 2 reactors the latter belonging to filter a highest n value for filter b the goodness of the fitting is extremely low because the influent is highly scattered in time several hours and a bell shape distribution curve cannot be obtained this must be taken into account on the following when interpreting the kinetic parameters and the phosphorus retention capacity based on n and the dead zones here determined dispersion values are quite moderate except for the horizontal filter filter c the analysis of the hydraulic performance leads to other observations according to the hydraulic regime 3 1 1 vertical filters the presence of high to moderate dead zones was identified by tracer test regardless of flow direction up flow or down flow since the mass of tracer recovered was lower than 80 for filters a and d the results must be interpreted with care however visual observations corroborated the presence of some hydraulic anomalies and pointed out the importance of the even hydraulic distribution in vertical granulated apatite filters water distribution and recovery systems must be well designed in order to limit dead zones in filter d down flow the lack of a superficial ponding water and insufficient distribution ramps do not allow a good water distribution over the entire surface of the filter water infiltrates close to the distribution pipes and moves vertically to the outlet resulting in an important short circuit in the tracer curve fig s 1 d for filter a up flow vertical filter which has a ponding zone the dead zone can be attributed to heterogeneities in the water flow due to deficiencies in the collector systems filter b showed some heterogeneity in the cross section of the bed during penetrometry tests which may have led to the appearance of dead volumes the material density increased progressively with the depth of the filter as shown in fig 2 b since the filter is by passed and drained during the winter period crystallization phenomena onto the apatite surface can be exacerbated effectively gluing the granules to one another this compaction at some levels of the filtering bed may have led to water flow disruptions and bed heterogeneities 3 1 2 horizontal filter planted with phragmites australis for filter c no dead volume was identified but a short circuit at the beginning of the tracer test was observed see fig s 1 c supplementary material visual observation confirmed surface flow at different locations it is thus possible that hydraulic conductivity decreased with time due to organic matter accumulation development of phragmites or the evolution of the ga density compaction degradation such flow heterogeneity within the media was as well confirmed by internal spot samplings which revealed important differences in p concentrations at locations of the filter with the same theoretical hrt due to the large surface of the filter and the distribution system implemented large central distribution ramps with not enough maintenance flow distribution and flow pathways inside the filter bed are highly heterogeneous leading to high performance variations inside the filter the lack of a homogeneous flow distribution is also caused by heterogeneities in the material density penetrometer measurements together with direct observation revealed compaction solidification and disaggregation of the granules at different locations within the filter those disturbances of the media density at depths in between 10 and 30 cm from surface see fig s 2 supplementary material might be attributed to variably hydraulic saturation conditions that could have dried the more superficial layers and favoured crystallisation indeed despite the filter was supposed to operate hydraulically saturated it was often found to be partially unsaturated during the campaigns 3 2 evolution of ph monitoring of filter d from its commissioning showed a dramatic increase of the effluent ph such ph increase is mostly due to lime dissolution from the cement binder of the granulated apatite in contact with water which releases hydroxyl ions into the effluent as represented in eq 11 2 11 c a o h 2 o c a 2 2 o h the calcite layer above the apatite may also help keeping a basic ph for a longer time fig 3 shows the evolution of ph with the amount of effluent passed per volume of filter ph drops below the upper regulatory threshold of 8 5 ph units after 100 m3 of water per m3 of filter or 420 m3 m3 when dead zones are considered since high ph values in wwtps effluents can endanger aquatic ecosystems a ph correction of the plant s effluent must be implemented during significant periods after the commissioning of the filter from months to around a year according to the design of the filter lime dissolution also affects supersaturation of the solution by increasing the ca2 concentration high ph and supersaturation levels should promote the precipitation of calcium phosphates and calcium carbonates calcium dissolution and ph increase can be also responsible for high kinetic rates in gaf right after the commissioning there may be some counterproductive effects the formation of a carbonated layer on the surface of the ga may prevent cap retention and may accelerate the compaction of the material leading to a decrease of the hydraulic conductivity 3 3 phosphorus retention performances prc phosphorus retention efficiency depends on the cumulated p load retained by a particular filter performance results can be represented in terms of prc to calculate the saturation level data from the historical performance of regulatory surveys and data from measurement campaigns was used since regulatory data often concerned just inlet and outlet concentrations of the wwtp and not from ga filter specifically an estimation of the performance evolution was carried out these estimations were based on several criteria phosphate po4 p concentration at the outlet of the filter is determined from total phosphorus tp measurements by applying an average particulate phosphorus pp to total suspended solids tss ratio obtained during measurement campaigns pp tss 0 01 when the filter is on second stage filter c p concentration at the outlet of the filter is assimilated to the p concentration at the outlet of the wwtp as po4 p since no significant retention of p is expected to occur on the third stage of treatment the mean inlet po4 p concentration of measurement campaigns for a particular filter is used when no data are available finally estimations are carried out considering a constant mean flow rate based on all available data the application of these criteria entails indeed a high level of uncertainty resulting in a high variability of the estimations that must be considered for results interpretation the characteristics of the inflow for the three filters a b and c are presented in table s1 of the supplementary material by representing the evolution of the retained p as a function of the cumulative load received by the filters the maximum retention capacity of ga in real conditions can be discussed fig 4 shows similar initial retention trends for low cumulative p loads in all filters nevertheless the evolution of the performance of the filter with increasing cumulative load can only be seen for filter a a reduction of the filter efficiency is observed at around 3 5 g po4 p retained kg material attaining an asymptotic trend at 4 0 g po4 p kg material when the estimated dead volume dv is considered the maximum prc is attained at 7 4 g po4 p kg material p in a reduced reactor volume fig 4 a several factors may significantly affect prc estimations like the presence of dead zones as well as the uncertainties associated with flow rates and the inlet concentrations for instance to consider the impact of inlet concentration assumptions the standard deviation of the mean inlet concentration can be used as shown in fig 4 b for filter a this highlights the great variability of prc estimations due to the uncertainty associated with the low regulatory surveys frequency the evolution of prc is also compared with the results of the experiment conducted in a laboratory scale filter with synthetic water under controlled conditions column 1 from delgado gonzález et al 10 the drop in p retention yield is observed at prc values higher than those obtained under real conditions the differences may be due to the uncertainties associated with the hypothesis applied for the estimations in full scale systems but also the consequences of the impact of real wastewater characteristics on chemical reaction in this sense two major aspects may negatively affect p retention in full scale systems the biomass development onto the surface of the filter material 9 and the influence of several different ions present in the effluent on the chemical reaction it has been reported that the concentration and type of organic molecules and inorganics salts present in the effluent produce different aqueous solvation environments which may affect differently the precipitation processes and kinetics even when comparing solutions with the same ionic strength 11 it is worth noting that when considering the dead volume and the uncertainty on the input concentration the estimation can bring the saturation curve close to the one obtained in laboratory conditions fig 4 b 3 4 kinetic rates of p retention in full scale systems the calculation of the reaction kinetics can be assessed based on input output concentrations or by internal sampling along the hydraulic retention time the calibration of model parameters for both types of sampling data implies however different issues when defining kv values on average input output data a strong uncertainty in kv is observed for outlet concentrations close to c on the other hand when the outlet concentration is high c cannot be estimated correctly a more precise estimation of the model parameters is possible by monitoring the evolution of p concentration at the bulk of the filter by internal sampling nevertheless heterogeneous flows within the media can induce uncertainties as well consequently the model parameters are here discussed only as an order of magnitude and compared to the experiments done in controlled conditions 10 fig 5 shows kinetic rate coefficients estimated by internal sampling during the intensive campaigns the evolution of kv with the prc obtained in a laboratory column with synthetic water is also plotted for comparison fig 5 provides an example of how the model was fitted to the experimental data to determine the model parameters kv and c the nonlinear grg generalized reduced gradient solver method was used for the calculations the hydraulic efficiency of the filters was taken into consideration for the estimations all filters showed low kinetic rate coefficients in most cases below the ones determined for the laboratory column although it can be assumed that results remain in the same order of magnitude kv from lab column experiments 1 h 1 the differences are likely related with the uncertainties associated to the historical data and the flow heterogeneities in the bulk of the filter that cannot be taken into consideration a mean flowrate is used but the measurements are localized in a specific point of the filter in addition the implementation of the reactions in real conditions wastewater instead of synthetic water can also affect the kinetic rates differently from laboratory experiments with synthetic solutions 3 11 the model parameters evolve with the prc which is not homogeneous in the bulk of the filter the media layers close to the feeding would normally have greater amounts of p retained than those layers close to the outlet of the filter this may result in differences in kv and c values as a function of hrt inside the filter this was indeed the case of filter a up flow during the first campaign where the first 50 cm of the filter were hardly reactive with a kv of approximately 0 09 h 1 the last 50 cm of the filter was still actively retaining p at relatively high kinetic rates kv 1 3 h 1 an average kv value was calculated for the entire filter localised flow heterogeneities inside the filter can also lead to differences in the estimated parameters for instance variations of kv were observed in filters a or d for the same prc on the other hand the extremely low values of filter c are derived from a large hrt since a significant reduction in p concentration is still observed see table s 2 of supplementary material 3 5 adsorption models previous results have showed a relatively rapid loss of performance of the gaf leading to the supposition that the material may behaved more as an adsorptive substrate than a seed to promote precipitation the precipitates filling the internal porosity of the granules may behave as an adsorptive like process where the filling indicates the end of the sorption capacity consequently fixed bed adsorption models were used to assess the evolution of output concentrations with time due to limited data concerning the other filters and their lower prc attained estimations using the adsorption models were only possible for filter a the calculations considered constant flow rate 53 m3 day constant inlet concentration mean value 4 4 mg po4 p l and 45 of dead zones the bohart adams model bam and the modified dose response model msrm were used and compared with experimental data fig 6 in both cases the non linear regressions of the models showed to be in better agreement with experimental data than linear regressions table 5 among the non linear expressions the goodness of the fitting is slightly better for the mdrm despite previous results on the hydraulics performance showed that the system does not behave as a plug flow reactor the mdrm is an empirical model especially adapted for very long experimental times as the case of this study by using fixed bed models one can also predict the maximum phosphorus retention capacity of the system this was 8 0 and 7 0 g po4 p kg ga according to the non linear regressions of the mdrm and bam respectively the predictions are in agreement with results shown in fig 4 b the objective of this analysis was not to give an in depth assessment of sorption mechanisms but to be able to correlate the behaviour of the gaf with those associated with sorption systems in this sense based on the given results it can be assumed that filter a behaved as an adsorptive media under the particular solution conditions of the system 3 6 retention processes in delgado gonzález et al 10 it was found that p retention occurred in two different ways depending on calcium concentration and its impact on the supersaturation of the solution with respect to cap solid phases hydroxyapatite hap as the referent precipitate for low ca concentrations around 70 mg l the ions were able to diffuse through the internal porosity of the granules adsorbing and then precipitating within the pores this would eventually clog their internal porosity from a depth of 100 300 μm from the surface once precipitates reach the surface of the granule the reaction would not occur at a sufficient rate lower specific surface area leading to a decrease of the retention performance for solutions with higher ca concentration around 110 mg l supersaturation allowed heterogeneous precipitation onto the surface of the granules leading to superposed layers of carbonated hap precipitates that can theoretically grow until the porosity of the gaf clogs the supersaturation of a solution with respect to a particular solid phase can be assessed through the saturation index si defined by the expression in eq 12 it depends in temperature the ionic strength of the solution and the concentration of the constitutive elements of the solid phase in solution 12 s i log i a p k s p log i a i v i i a i v i e q where iap is the ionic activity product ksp is the solubility product constant a i is the activity of the ith constitutive element of the solid in solution v i is the stoichiometric number for the ith element and eq indicates chemical equilibrium the supersaturation conditions of full scale gaf were assessed to help identifying the process involved in p retention with real wastewater the saturation indexes si of the influent were calculated using phreeqc 23 see tables s 3 6 of the supplementary material table 6 shows the supersaturation characteristics of the influent in filter a revealing supersaturated conditions with respect to cap phases as tricalcium phosphate tcp octocalcium phosphate ocp and hydroxyapatite hap but also with carbonated compounds as calcite and dolomite the sis in particular for hap are lower but closer to the influent characteristics of column 1 of delgado gonzález et al 10 where the adsorption and precipitation occurred inside the granules such results would explain the low kinetic rates observed in fig 5 in order to assess the similarity of the retention processes in full scale systems with those observed in the laboratory columns scanning electron microscopy sem images were carried out on samples of the filtration bed for filters a b and c the micrographs revealed a porous surface with a morphology close to that of a raw granule in all the cases some traces of crystalline particles were also observed on the surface of the granules but a precipitate layer wrapping the granules was not present as it was observed in delgado gonzález et al 10 the mentioned difference can be understand from the comparison of both images of fig 7 the fig 7 a shows a porous surface with some residues and crystalline particles from a granule in filter b the appearance of the surface of the granules from the other filters was also similar to that of fig 7 a see fig s 4 of supplementary material in fig 7 b a micrograph of a sample taken from the laboratory column fed with a high calcium concentration is shown 10 a completely different morphology of the surface is clearly observed a deposit layer formed onto the granule which was identified as a carbonated hap in delgado gonzález et al 8 therefore concerning samples from the full scale filters there are no elements indicating an effective precipitation of calcium phosphates at the surface of the granules in conclusion it appears that p retention is carried out in a similar way as in the low supersaturated solutions of the laboratory scale filters the retention dynamics could be then assimilated to a sorption process rather than a precipitation process reason why data correlates relatively well with adsorption models the major differences in p retention performance and kinetics with respect to column experiments are 1 the scaling up effect which would account for a reduction in the hydraulic performance 2 the impact of the ion concentration and organic and inorganic molecules on the supersaturation of the solution 3 the reduction of the available surface area due to the adsorption of organic molecules and or the development of biomass on the granules 4 conclusions the assessment of full scale gaf has highlighted some critical issues that should be considered in the design and implementation of these systems in terms of the hydraulic performance the use of several different measures and techniques tracer tests penetrometer measurements and spot samplings has determined the presence of dead volumes in all the four filters in this study since the horizontal configuration led to important heterogeneities in the media and in the water flow a vertical filter with a permanent water ponding appears to be a better configuration ensuring the hydraulic saturation of the filter nevertheless special attention should be paid in the conception and installation of the hydraulic distribution and collection system to avoid the presence of dead zones the maximum prc of a full scale gaf under real conditions was estimated in 7 4 g po4 p kg based on the evolution of the prc of filter a and considering the presence of dead zones depending on the specific characteristics of the filter and the wastewater this translates into an effective filter life of five to six years however the lack of historical data has introduced important uncertainties to the estimations thus maximum prc may vary from 4 6 to 10 7 g po4 p kg of ga the prc determined for full scale apatite filters is consistent with results from laboratory columns prc approximately 10 g po4 p kg the kv values for full scale gaf are generally lower but close to those obtained for the lab scale experiments in delgado gonzález et al 10 the flow heterogeneities and the influence of wastewater can be responsible of such differences the uncertainties associated with the determination of the prc can also play a significant role in the results obtained the simulation of si and the observation of sem micrographs of the surface of the granules has allows to say that p retention takes places by adsorption and precipitation within the porosity of granule any sustainable precipitation does initiate at the surface as a result the behaviour of the system can be estimated with a sorption process finally the monitoring of the ph for filter d has shown a significant increase of the ph of the effluent approximately 420 m3 of water per cubic meter of filter were needed to reduce ph to the regulatory limits when considering dead zones declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

long time and are difficult to degrade photocatalytic oxidation treatment using nanostructured materials is a promising method due to low energy consumption and no secondary pollution 7 10 this method can effectively remove and degrade organic pollutants and heavy metal ions 11 14 many semiconductor materials such as wo3 15 tio2 16 cds 17 and zno 18 19 are widely studied as photocatalysts because

controlling the formation of cds nanowires on zno and al2o3 substrates which played a major role in enhancing hydrogen production 27 moreover two dimensional semiconductor materials have been

tartrate salt c15h25no3 98 0 was supplied by shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd all the chemicals were of analytical grade 2 2 methods 2 2 1 preparation of tio2 nanocrystals tio2 was synthesized with a hydrothermal method typically 5 5420 g h8f6n2ti and 5 1937 g h3bo3 were dissolved in deionized water at room temperature 20 then 0 3 m hcl 35 v v was added to the mixture to adjust ph 3 0 the mixed solution was moved into a stainless steel autoclave and kept at 90 for 5 h the sample was collected by centrifugation 3500 rpm washed several times with deionized water and dried in an oven 60 then the tio2 nanocrystals were obtained 2 2 2 preparation of wo3 tio2 heterojunction sample wo3 tio2 heterojunction sample was synthesized by combined a hydrothermal and a calcination method specifically 300 mg the prepared tio2 was dissolved in 70 ml deionized water with different amounts of na2wo4 2h2o 22 45 mg 44 90 mg and 89 81 mg at room temperature 20 c then 0 3 m hcl 35 v v was added to the mixture to adjust ph 1 0 the mixed solution was moved into a stainless steel autoclave and kept at 180 for 12 h the sample was collected by centrifugation 3500 rpm washed with deionized water three times and dried in an oven 60 c finally the sample was calcined in flowing air at 500 c for 1 h to attain wo3 tio2 heterojunction wo3 tio2 samples were labeled as 5 10 20 wo3 tio2 where the ratios 5 20 were the mass ratios of w in wo3 to ti in tio2 for the purpose of comparison wo3 was obtained by the same method without adding tio2 detailed experimental methods on sample preparation and characterization are given in the supplementary file 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of wo3 tio2 samples 3 1 1 structural and morphological analysis the xrd patterns of tio2 and wo3 tio2 samples are shown in fig 1 it can be observed that the main diffraction peaks of wo3 tio2 samples were ascribed to the 101 004 200 105 and 204 crystal planes of anatase tio2 which corresponded well to tio2 crystal structure jcpds card no 21 1272 37 all wo3 tio2 samples 5 10 20 wo3 tio2 showed the characteristic peaks of monoclinic wo3 jcpds card no 083 0950 38 the diffraction peaks at 2θ 23 1 23 6 24 4 26 6 and 34 1 were assigned to the 002 020 200 120 and 202 planes of the monoclinic wo3 respectively 38 in general doping w element into the lattice structure may cause the diffraction peak to shift at a lower angle due to the expansion of the lattice spacing d 39 40 the xrd results showed that with the amount of wo3 increased the diffraction peak intensity of wo3 increased in the composite material but the angle of the diffraction peak did not shift in addition no diffraction peaks of other impurities were observed in wo3 tio2 samples indicating that no impurities were present fig 2 shows sem images of the prepared wo3 tio2 tio2 and wo3 samples the results indicated that pure tio2 was constructed from nanoparticles and irregular sheet structures fig 2a and pure wo3 was in the form of regular nanoparticles the length and width were 50 100 nm fig 2b for 5 wo3 tio2 sample it can be observed from fig 2c that the spherical structure composed of nanoparticles was formed which probably was due to the addition of na2wo4 2h2o and 0 3 m hcl to change the morphology of the particles and cause the aggregation among the particles 41 the radius of the sphere structure was about 1 6 μm and the dispersion was low between the sphere structures resulting in agglomeration as the amount of na2wo4 2h2o increased the particles aggregated into a hollow sphere structure in fig 2d therefore it is speculated that the different amount of na2wo4 2h2o caused the aggregation of nanoparticles in different ways which played a major role in the formation of the different structure fig 2f and g show the eds element mapping images of ti and w in 10 wo3 tio2 the results show that tio2 and wo3 nanoparticles were homogeneously distributed in the composite sample when the amount of sodium tungstate continuously increased it can be observed that a burger structure with nanoparticles interposed between the two layers of nanosheets as shown in fig 2e to further investigate the microstructure of pure tio2 and wo3 tio2 composite samples transmission electron microscopy tem images were used numerous nanocrystals 100 200 nm as shown in fig 3 a were clustered together to form a secondary hollow microspheres structure fig 3b this was consistent with sem results in fig 2 the hrtem images in fig 3c and d show very clear crystalline planes with a d spacing of 0 352 nm which closely matched the 101 facets of the anatase tio2 moreover the lattice fringe with a spacing of 0 385 nm in fig 3d could be assigned to the interplanar spacing of the 001 of wo3 the clear lattice fringe indicated a high crystallinity and integrated crystal structure of pure tio2 and 10 wo3 tio2 samples which could be verified by the xrd results the hrtem results further demonstrated that 10 wo3 tio2 composite with hollow microsphere structure was successfully synthesized 3 1 2 xps and uv vis analysis the element composition and valence of wo3 tio2 samples were analyzed by using xps fig 4 a shows the ti 2p spectra of tio2 and 10 wo3 tio2 sample the binding energy of ti 2p in 10 wo3 tio2 sample shifted to a higher energy compared to tio2 it can be seen that the binding energy at 459 3 ev and 464 7 ev was attributed to ti 2p2 3 and ti 2p1 2 energy levels from the curve of 10 wo3 tio2 42 the difference between the two energy levels was about 5 4 ev which suggested that ti element existed in the form of ti4 in tio2 37 fig 4b exhibits the o 1s spectra of wo3 and 10 wo3 tio2 the binding energy at 530 5 ev corresponded to lattice oxygen of wo band in wo3 for 10 wo3 tio2 the binding energy at 530 3 ev corresponded to the lattice oxygen of ti4 o or w6 o indicating that wo and tio shared the orbital o 1s in woti bond the binding energy at 532 2 ev was attributed to the combination of surface hydroxyl and ti or w group 43 it could be observed that the binding energy of o 1s shifted to low energy by 0 2 ev the xps spectrum of the w 4f in wo3 and 10 wo3 tio2 sample can be observed in fig 4c the result showed that w element had been doped into tio2 during the formation of wo3 tio2 heterojunction 44 the binding energies 35 4 ev and 37 8 ev were attributed to w 4f7 2 and w 4f5 2 in 10 wo3 tio2 sample respectively corresponding to the spin orbit splitting of w 4f 45 compared with wo3 the binding energies of w 4f7 2 and w 4f5 2 were shifted to high energy by 0 3 and 0 5 ev respectively the change in the binding energy means that carrier transfer occurred between wo3 and tio2 in 10 wo3 tio2 sample the binding energy of ti 2p shifted to a high energy and the binding energy of o 1s shifted to a low energy confirming the decrease and increase of electron density on the surface of tio2 and wo3 46 respectively this suggested that electron transfer occurred in 10 wo3 tio2 sample 47 the result indicated that the photogenerated carriers h were successfully transferred from wo3 to tio2 in the composite which further proved the formation of wo3 tio2 heterojunction structure the absorption edge depended on the bandgap energy of the photocatalyst determining the spectrum response region of the sample 48 it could be found that the absorption value of 10 wo3 tio2 sample was slightly reduced in the ultraviolet wavelength range while that was significantly increased in the visible light range compared to tio2 in fig 5 a the absorption value of 10 wo3 tio2 sample at a wavelength λ 411 nm was higher than that of pure wo3 in addition with more doping of wo3 the absorption value of the composite sample gradually increased in the range of visible light the absorption value of the composite material increased significantly in the visible light wavelength range indicating that the spectrum response of the sample to visible light was significantly enhanced 49 as shown in fig 5b the bandgap energy of tio2 wo3 and 10 wo3 tio2 sample were 2 9 2 5 and 2 4 ev respectively thus the bandgap energy of 10 wo3 tio2 sample was decreased compared to that of tio2 and wo3 this was because the combination of the two materials could change the original bandgap energy and form a new energy level in the composite material 41 the reduction of the bandgap energy could widen the spectrum response to the visible light range and reduce the recombination of photo generated electrons and holes on the catalyst surface causing a better photodegradation performance in visible light 3 1 3 specific surface aperture analysis bet fig 6 shows the n2 absorption desorption isotherms and the pore size distribution curves of the prepared tio2 and 10 wo3 tio2 sample the isotherms of tio2 and 10 wo3 tio2 sample were all of type iv and there was a sharp rise at the relative pressure of about 0 9 pa it could be observed from the insert that the pore diameters of tio2 and 10 wo3 tio2 composite were mainly between 2 10 nm in addition the pore size around 20 nm for the composite sample was slightly increased the larger pore size was beneficial for pollutant molecules to enter the inner surface of the composite material and fully contact the photocatalyst 50 the bet analysis results suggested that the specific surface area of tio2 and 10 wo3 tio2 sample were 11 4470 and 11 7505 m2 g respectively fig s2a and b exhibit the isotherm adsorption desorption curve and pore size distribution curve of 5 wo3 tio2 and 20 wo3 tio2 samples respectively the isotherms of the composite samples were all of type iv and the bet analysis results indicated that the specific surface areas of 5 wo3 tio2 and 20 wo3 tio2 samples were 8 8682 and 7 5294 m2 g respectively therefore the hollow sphere structure of 10 wo3 tio2 sample has a larger specific surface area than other composite samples which benefits contacting pollutants and improves degradation 3 2 photocatalytic efficiency study the photocatalytic performance of the synthesized tio2 and wo3 tio2 samples was tested based on the photodegradation of mb and met fig s3a and b show the adsorption of mb and met for all the samples the results indicated that the samples reached adsorption equilibrium within 30 min fig 7 a and b exhibit the photodegradation performance of all the samples for mb and met respectively it could be observed that the photodegradation performance of wo3 tio2 samples were significantly enhanced compared with that of pure tio2 and wo3 after 2 h of photoreaction the degradation performance of 10 wo3 tio2 sample was the optimal and the removal rate reached 87 8 while pure tio2 and wo3 could only remove 40 7 and 55 3 mb as for met 10 wo3 tio2 sample could remove 67 1 met while pure tio2 and wo3 could only remove 41 6 and 54 8 met fig s5 shows the photodegradation performances of zno sno2 and 10 wo3 tio2 sample on mb and met under the same condition the results indicated that zno and sno2 could only remove 27 8 and 15 6 mb and 21 0 and 13 6 met respectively and therefore 10 wo3 tio2 sample had a better photodegradation performance than zno and sno2 the main reason for the enhanced photodegradation of 10 wo3 tio2 sample was that its narrower band gap energy could broaden the spectral response range the heterojunction structure could effectively improve the separation efficiency of photo generated carriers and larger specific surface area than other composite samples could benefit contacting pollutants and improves degradation in addition it could be observed that the photodegradation efficiency of 20 wo3 tio2 sample was actually lower than that of 10 wo3 tio2 this was because the addition of more wo3 nanoparticles changed the hollow sphere structure of 10 wo3 tio2 sample and reduced the specific surface area which was confirmed by the bet analysis results also the sem results showed that wo3 and tio2 in 10 wo3 tio2 sample were more fully combined compared to these in 5 and 20 wo3 tio2 samples which promoted the effective separation of photogenerated carriers to explore the influencing factors for the degradation of mb and met the effect of critical parameters on the photodegradation performance of composite samples was acquired fig s4 shows the effect of ph the amount of composite sample and the concentration of pollutants on the photodegradation as shown in fig s4a the photodegradation performance was inhibited under acidic conditions while it was enhanced under alkaline conditions this was because acidic conditions inhibited the existence of oh which caused the reduction of oh radicals fig s4b shows the effect of the amount of composite material on the photodegradation performance it could be observed that as the amount increased the photodegradation efficiency was enhanced when the amount of the composite material was 50 mg the degradation efficiency reached the maximum and larger amount did not significantly change the degradation performance fig s4c presents the effect of different initial concentrations of mb and met on photodegradation performance the results indicated that the optimal initial concentrations of mb and met were 10 and 2 mg l respectively to further investigate the photodegradation performance of composite materials in the real matrix fig 8 shows the performance of 10 wo3 tio2 samples on photodegrading mb and met in municipal wastewater the results indicated that 10 wo3 tio2 sample could still maintained high removal efficiency for mb and met in municipal wastewater after 2 h of photodegradation reaction the removal rates for mb and met were 85 5 and 62 2 respectively therefore 10 wo3 tio2 sample is promising candidate for wastewater treatment in practical applications recycling experiments was carried out to explore the stability of 10 wo3 tio2 sample under visible light 10 wo3 tio2 sample was recovered by centrifugation after each experiment and a recycling test was performed under the same conditions as in photodegradation experiment of mb and met as shown in fig 9 a and b after three cycles of experiments 10 wo3 tio2 samples could still remove 79 8 of mb and 63 2 of met respectively in addition fig 10 exhibits the xrd pattern of 10 wo3 tio2 sample before and after the photoreaction it could be observed that the crystal structure of 10 wo3 tio2 sample did not change after the reaction the above results indicated that 10 wo3 tio2 sample had an excellent stability after photodegradation reaction 3 3 photocatalytic mechanism of wo3 tio2 the photocatalytic species capture experiment was conducted under visible light methanol isopropanol and benzoquinone were selected as scavengers for the holes h hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide radicals o2 in degrading mb and met the photodegradation performance was hardly affected when benzoquinone was added to the mixture which indicated that the effect of o2 radicals on the photodegradation process was negligible as shown in fig 11 however after adding methanol and isopropanol to the mixture especially isopropanol the photodegradation performance was significantly suppressed which showed that h and oh radicals were the main active species in the photodegradation process to further investigate the effective separation of photo generated carriers the pl spectrum test was carried out as shown in fig 12 the peak near 410 nm was the near band emission peak from wo3 and the emission peak near 470 nm was caused by defects such as surface oxygen vacancies 51 the pl spectrum intensity of 10 wo3 tio2 was significantly reduced compared with wo3 which indicated that 10 wo3 tio2 composite sample could effectively reduce the recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs and promote the separation of photogenerated carriers the photocatalytic degradation mechanism of the wo3 tio2 samples was schematically demonstrated in fig 13 when wo3 tio2 heterojunction photocatalyst surface absorbs visible light energy the photo generated electrons in wo3 valence band will be stimulated to the conduction band generating photo generated electrons and holes due to the fact that the bandgap energy of wo3 2 5 ev is lower than the visible photon energy hv 41 however it cannot occur for tio2 because the bandgap energy of tio2 2 9 ev is higher than the visible photon energy hv 41 it was reported in the literature that the valence edge potentials of wo3 and tio2 were 3 34 ev vs nhe 52 and 2 91 ev vs nhe 53 respectively therefore the photo generated holes can be easily shifted to the valence band of tio2 through the interface because of its lower the valence edge potential compared to that of wo3 in the previously reported tio2 wo3 heterojunction photogenerated electrons e will further react with o2 in water to form o2 and then participate in the degradation reaction 36 however in this study the photo generated electrons on wo3 conduction band cannot react with o2 to generate o2 radicals because the conduction edge potential of wo3 0 74 ev vs nhe 52 was higher than the redox potential of o2 to o2 0 33 ev vs nhe 54 thus the radicals of o2 can hardly participate in the photodegradation reaction photo generated holes h will react with oh to product oh radicals which were main active species that oxidize and degrade organic pollutants the above results showed tio2 acted as a photo generated holes acceptor in a heterojunction effectively reducing the recombination of photo generated carriers and enhancing photocatalytic performance 4 conclusion in this study a novel hollow sphere structure wo3 tio2 heterojunction was prepared by combining a hydrothermal and a calcination method the morphology microstructure and optical properties of the obtained wo3 tio2 composite were characterized the results showed 10 wo3 tio2 was a hollow sphere like structure in sem image and the bandgap energy of wo3 tio2 sample was lower than that of tio2 and wo3 bet analysis results show that the hollow spherical structure of 10 wo3 tio2 composite sample was of the largest specific surface area compared with 5 and 20 wo3 tio2 sample which benefited the capture of organic pollutants the pl spectrum results indicated that 10 wo3 tio2 composite sample could effectively reduce the recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs and promote the separation of photogenerated carriers 10 wo3 tio2 sample showed enhanced photocatalytic performance compared with pure tio2 and wo3 in degrading a high concentration dye mb and a micro organic pollutant met under visible light the maximum mb and met removal efficiency were 87 8 and 67 1 for 10 wo3 tio2 sample within 150 min after three cycles of experiments 10 wo3 tio2 samples could still remove 79 8 of mb and 63 2 of met respectively the photodegradation mechanism of wo3 tio2 samples was revealed and discussed tio2 acted as a photo generated holes acceptor in a heterojunction

2d therefore it is speculated that the different amount of na2wo4 2h2o caused the aggregation of nanoparticles in different ways which played a major role in the formation of the different structure fig 2f and g show the eds element mapping images of ti and w in 10 wo3 tio2 the results show that tio2 and wo3 nanoparticles were homogeneously distributed in the composite sample when the amount of sodium tungstate continuously increased it can be observed that a burger structure with nanoparticles interposed between the two layers of nanosheets as shown in fig 2e to further investigate the microstructure of pure tio2 and wo3 tio2 composite samples transmission electron microscopy tem images were used numerous nanocrystals 100 200 nm as shown in fig 3 a were clustered together to form a secondary hollow microspheres structure fig 3b this was consistent with sem results in fig 2 the hrtem images in fig 3c and d show very clear crystalline planes with a d spacing of 0 352 nm which closely matched the 101 facets of the anatase tio2 moreover the lattice fringe with a spacing of 0 385 nm in fig 3d could be assigned to the interplanar spacing of the 001 of wo3 the clear lattice fringe indicated a high crystallinity and integrated crystal structure of pure tio2 and 10 wo3 tio2 samples which could be verified by the xrd results the hrtem results further demonstrated that 10 wo3 tio2 composite with hollow microsphere structure was successfully synthesized 3 1 2 xps and uv vis analysis the element composition and valence of wo3 tio2 samples were analyzed by using xps fig 4 a shows the ti 2p spectra of tio2 and 10 wo3 tio2 sample the binding energy of ti 2p in 10 wo3 tio2 sample shifted to a higher energy compared to tio2 it can be seen that the binding energy at 459 3 ev and 464 7 ev was attributed to ti 2p2 3 and ti 2p1 2 energy levels from the curve of 10 wo3 tio2 42 the difference between the two energy levels was about 5 4 ev which suggested that ti element existed in the form of ti4 in tio2 37 fig 4b exhibits the o 1s spectra of wo3 and 10 wo3 tio2 the binding energy at 530 5 ev corresponded to lattice oxygen of wo band in wo3 for 10 wo3 tio2 the binding energy at 530 3 ev corresponded to the lattice oxygen of ti4 o or w6 o indicating that wo and tio shared the orbital o 1s in woti bond the binding energy at 532 2 ev was attributed to the combination of surface hydroxyl and ti or w group 43 it could be observed that the binding energy of o 1s shifted to low energy by 0 2 ev the xps spectrum of the w 4f in wo3 and 10 wo3 tio2 sample can be observed in fig 4c the result showed that w element had been doped into tio2 during the formation of wo3 tio2 heterojunction 44 the binding energies 35 4 ev and 37 8 ev were attributed to w 4f7 2 and w 4f5 2 in 10 wo3 tio2 sample respectively corresponding to the spin orbit splitting of w 4f 45 compared with wo3 the binding energies of w 4f7 2 and w 4f5 2 were shifted to high energy by 0 3 and 0 5 ev respectively the change in the binding energy means that carrier transfer occurred between wo3 and tio2 in 10 wo3 tio2 sample the binding energy of ti 2p shifted to a high energy and the binding energy of o 1s shifted to a low energy confirming the decrease and increase of electron density on the surface of tio2 and wo3 46 respectively this suggested that electron transfer occurred in 10 wo3 tio2 sample 47 the result indicated that the photogenerated carriers h were successfully transferred from wo3 to tio2 in the composite which further proved the formation of wo3 tio2 heterojunction structure the absorption edge depended on the bandgap energy of the photocatalyst determining the spectrum response region of the sample 48 it could be found that the absorption value of 10 wo3 tio2 sample was slightly reduced in the ultraviolet wavelength range while that was significantly increased in the visible light range compared to tio2 in fig 5 a the absorption value of 10 wo3 tio2 sample at a wavelength λ 411 nm was higher than that of pure wo3 in addition with more doping of wo3 the absorption value of the composite sample gradually increased in the range of visible light the absorption value of the composite material increased significantly in the visible light wavelength range indicating that the spectrum response of the sample to visible light was significantly enhanced 49 as shown in fig 5b the bandgap energy of tio2 wo3 and 10 wo3 tio2 sample were 2 9 2 5 and 2 4 ev respectively thus the bandgap energy of 10 wo3 tio2 sample was decreased compared to that of tio2 and wo3 this was because the combination of the two materials could change the original bandgap energy and form a new energy level in the composite material 41 the reduction of the bandgap energy could widen the spectrum response to the visible light range and reduce the recombination of photo generated electrons and holes on the catalyst surface causing a better photodegradation performance in visible light 3 1 3 specific surface aperture analysis bet fig 6 shows the n2 absorption desorption isotherms and the pore size distribution curves of the prepared tio2 and 10 wo3 tio2 sample the isotherms of tio2 and 10 wo3 tio2 sample were all of type iv and there was a sharp rise at the relative pressure of about 0 9 pa it could be observed from the insert that the pore diameters of tio2 and 10 wo3 tio2 composite were mainly between 2 10 nm in addition the pore size around 20 nm for the composite sample was slightly increased the larger pore size was beneficial for pollutant molecules to enter the inner surface of the composite material and fully contact the photocatalyst 50 the bet analysis results suggested that the specific surface area of tio2 and 10 wo3 tio2 sample were 11 4470 and 11 7505 m2 g respectively fig s2a and b exhibit the isotherm adsorption desorption curve and pore size distribution curve of 5 wo3 tio2 and 20 wo3 tio2 samples respectively the isotherms of the composite samples were all of type iv and the bet analysis results indicated that the specific surface areas of 5 wo3 tio2 and 20 wo3 tio2 samples were 8 8682 and 7 5294 m2 g respectively therefore the hollow sphere structure of 10 wo3 tio2 sample has a larger specific surface area than other composite samples which benefits contacting pollutants and improves degradation 3 2 photocatalytic efficiency study the photocatalytic performance of the synthesized tio2 and wo3 tio2 samples was tested based on the photodegradation of mb and met fig s3a and b show the adsorption of mb and met for all the samples the results indicated that the samples reached adsorption equilibrium within 30 min fig 7 a and b exhibit the photodegradation performance of all the samples for mb and met respectively it could be observed that the photodegradation performance of wo3 tio2 samples were significantly enhanced compared with that of pure tio2 and wo3 after 2 h of photoreaction the degradation performance of 10 wo3 tio2 sample was the optimal and the removal rate reached 87 8 while pure tio2 and wo3 could only remove 40 7 and 55 3 mb as for met 10 wo3 tio2 sample could remove 67 1 met while pure tio2 and wo3 could only remove 41 6 and 54 8 met fig s5 shows the photodegradation performances of zno sno2 and 10 wo3 tio2 sample on mb and met under the same condition the results indicated that zno and sno2 could only remove 27 8 and 15 6 mb and 21 0 and 13 6 met respectively and therefore 10 wo3 tio2 sample had a better photodegradation performance than zno and sno2 the main reason for the enhanced photodegradation of 10 wo3 tio2 sample was that its narrower band gap energy could broaden the spectral response range the heterojunction structure could effectively improve the separation efficiency of photo generated carriers and larger specific surface area than other composite samples could benefit contacting pollutants and improves degradation in addition it could be observed that the photodegradation efficiency of 20 wo3 tio2 sample was actually lower than that of 10 wo3 tio2 this was because the addition of more wo3 nanoparticles changed the hollow sphere structure of 10 wo3 tio2 sample and reduced the specific surface area which was confirmed by the bet analysis results also the sem results showed that wo3 and tio2 in 10 wo3 tio2 sample were more fully combined compared to these in 5 and 20 wo3 tio2 samples which promoted the effective separation of photogenerated carriers to explore the influencing factors for the degradation of mb and met the effect of critical parameters on the photodegradation performance of composite samples was acquired fig s4 shows the effect of ph the amount of composite sample and the concentration of pollutants on the photodegradation as shown in fig s4a the photodegradation performance was inhibited under acidic conditions while it was enhanced under alkaline conditions this was because acidic conditions inhibited the existence of oh which caused the reduction of oh radicals fig s4b shows the effect of the amount of composite material on the photodegradation performance it could be observed that as the amount increased the photodegradation efficiency was enhanced when the amount of the composite material was 50 mg the degradation efficiency reached the maximum and larger amount did not significantly change the degradation performance fig s4c presents the effect of different initial concentrations of mb and met on photodegradation performance the results indicated that the optimal initial concentrations of mb and met were 10 and 2 mg l respectively to further investigate the photodegradation performance of composite materials in the real matrix fig 8 shows the performance of 10 wo3 tio2 samples on photodegrading mb and met in municipal wastewater the results indicated that 10 wo3 tio2 sample could still maintained high removal efficiency for mb and met in municipal wastewater after 2 h of photodegradation reaction the removal rates for mb and met were 85 5 and 62 2 respectively therefore 10 wo3 tio2 sample is promising candidate for wastewater treatment in practical applications recycling experiments was carried out to explore the stability of 10 wo3 tio2 sample under visible light 10 wo3 tio2 sample was recovered by centrifugation after each experiment and a recycling test was performed under the same conditions as in photodegradation experiment of mb and met as shown in fig 9 a and b after three cycles of experiments 10 wo3 tio2 samples could still remove 79 8 of mb and 63 2 of met respectively in addition fig 10 exhibits the xrd pattern of 10 wo3 tio2 sample before and after the photoreaction it could be observed that the crystal structure of 10 wo3 tio2 sample did not change after the reaction the above results indicated that 10 wo3 tio2 sample had an excellent stability after photodegradation reaction 3 3 photocatalytic mechanism of wo3 tio2 the photocatalytic species capture experiment was conducted under visible light methanol isopropanol and benzoquinone were selected as scavengers for the holes h hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide radicals o2 in degrading mb and met the photodegradation performance was hardly affected when benzoquinone was added to the mixture which indicated that the effect of o2 radicals on the photodegradation process was negligible as shown in fig 11 however after adding methanol and isopropanol to the mixture especially isopropanol the photodegradation performance was significantly suppressed which showed that h and oh radicals were the main active species in the photodegradation process to further investigate the effective separation of photo generated carriers the pl spectrum test was carried out as shown in fig 12 the peak near 410 nm was the near band emission peak from wo3 and the emission peak near 470 nm was caused by defects such as surface oxygen vacancies 51 the pl spectrum intensity of 10 wo3 tio2 was significantly reduced compared with wo3 which indicated that 10 wo3 tio2 composite sample could effectively reduce the recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs and promote the separation of photogenerated carriers the photocatalytic degradation mechanism of the wo3 tio2 samples was schematically demonstrated in fig 13 when wo3 tio2 heterojunction photocatalyst surface absorbs visible light energy the photo generated electrons in wo3 valence band will be stimulated to the conduction band generating photo generated electrons and holes due to the fact that the bandgap energy of wo3 2 5 ev is lower than the visible photon energy hv 41 however it cannot occur for tio2 because the bandgap energy of tio2 2 9 ev is higher than the visible photon energy hv 41 it was reported in the literature that the valence edge potentials of wo3 and tio2 were 3 34 ev vs nhe 52 and 2 91 ev vs nhe 53 respectively therefore the photo generated holes can be easily shifted to the valence band of tio2 through the interface because of its lower the valence edge potential compared to that of wo3 in the previously reported tio2 wo3 heterojunction photogenerated electrons e will further react with o2 in water to form o2 and then participate in the degradation reaction 36 however in this study the photo generated electrons on wo3 conduction band cannot react with o2 to generate o2 radicals because the conduction edge potential of wo3 0 74 ev vs nhe 52 was higher than the redox potential of o2 to o2 0 33 ev vs nhe 54 thus the radicals of o2 can hardly participate in the photodegradation reaction photo generated holes h will react with oh to product oh radicals which were main active species that oxidize and degrade organic pollutants the above results showed tio2 acted as a photo generated holes acceptor in a heterojunction effectively reducing the recombination of photo generated carriers and enhancing photocatalytic performance 4 conclusion in this study a novel hollow sphere structure wo3 tio2 heterojunction was prepared by combining a hydrothermal and a calcination method the morphology microstructure and optical properties of the obtained wo3 tio2 composite were characterized the results showed 10 wo3 tio2 was a hollow sphere like structure in sem image and the bandgap energy of wo3 tio2 sample was lower than that of tio2 and wo3 bet analysis results show that the hollow spherical structure of 10 wo3 tio2 composite sample was of the largest specific surface area compared with 5 and 20 wo3 tio2 sample which benefited the capture of organic pollutants the pl spectrum results indicated that 10 wo3 tio2 composite sample could effectively reduce the recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs and promote the separation of photogenerated carriers 10 wo3 tio2 sample showed enhanced photocatalytic performance compared with pure tio2 and wo3 in degrading a high concentration dye mb and a micro organic pollutant met under visible light the maximum mb and met removal efficiency were 87 8 and 67 1 for 10 wo3 tio2 sample within 150 min after three cycles of experiments 10 wo3 tio2 samples could still remove 79 8 of mb and 63 2 of met respectively the photodegradation mechanism of wo3 tio2 samples was revealed and discussed tio2 acted as a photo generated holes acceptor in a heterojunction

13637,in this study the performance of a circular microbial electrolysis cell mec system on removing no3 n no2 n and nh4 n at low c n ratios was investigated with the assistance of active bioelectrode electron transportation and utilization efficiency between electron donor and acceptor was enhanced in mec high rate of nitrogen removal was observed in mec at 0 2 v which was 695 6 and 514 5 g n m3 d respectively under cod n 2 and cod n 1 without carbon source addition the symbiotic activity of anammox and electrochemical autotrophic denitrifiers were verified in mec in which the demand of no2 n for nh4 n removal is calculated to be 1 3 microbial community analysis revealed that the biocathode was enriched with autotrophic and heterotrophic nitrate nitrite reducing bacteria e g 5 09

denitrification and anammox can coexist and collaborate in the mec system the strict nitritation to produce only nitrite toward anammox can be avoided keywords autotrophic denitrification carbon nitrogen ratio microbial electrolysis cell nitrite accumulation partial denitrification 1 introduction the excessive use of nitrogen fertilizer in agriculture and the discharge of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater has led to a large amount of nitrogen entering into water environment worsening the water quality and threatening the human health 1 in the traditional wastewater treatment process nh4 n is converted to n2 via a two step pathway i e nitrification and denitrification nh4 n no2 n no3 n n2 2 3 in the denitrification process carbon to nitrogen ratio c n of 3 5 is necessary to support the metabolism of heterotrophic denitrification 4 when treating wastewater with low c n ratios it is common to add extra carbon source e g acetate methanol and ethanol to overcome the shortage of electron donor which makes this approach expensive and possible secondary pollution 5 thus it is essential to find new approaches to increase the electron exchange and utilization efficiency between electron donor and electron acceptor in recent years a promising approach for wastewater treatment is the application of bio electrochemical systems bes 6 7 in the microbial electrolysis cells mecs nitrification and denitrification can proceed simultaneously 8 9 at the cathode h is reduced to molecular hydrogen h2 through providing external power at a low voltage of 0 25 0 85 v which could be working as the electron donor for autotrophic denitrification 10 11 for the purpose of no3 n reduction the in situ biohydrogen production through bes would be competitive with external hydrogen supply 12 in the biocathode electroactive microorganisms can also direct accept electrons for denitrification and the electron utilization efficiency increased accordingly with the proportion of autotrophic denitrification which can reach nearly 100 13 nevertheless the biomass yield of autotrophic denitrifiers is usually low 11 in fact it is possible to combine heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrifiers within the mec system to increase the overall nitrogen removal rate in the study of zhu et al 14 the anodic oxidation of organics propionate butyrate acetate was promoted leading to a more efficient utilization rate with the limited carbon source in bioelectrochemical denitrification process the electrons could be delivered for nitrite reduction either from exoelectrogens to anode and then to denitrifying bacteria or directly from exoelectrogens to denitrifying bacteria 15 with the assistant of electrodes and electroactive bacteria a part of organic carbons utilized for other heterotrophic bacteria probably shifts to serve as electron donors for denitrification 16 as a result of it the more efficient utilization of the limited carbon sources for denitrification in low c n wastewater is expected nevertheless the removal pathways of nitrogen in mec systems subjected to varied influent substrate are distinct and the related investigation is still regarded in fancy 17 accordingly in this study the feasibility of simultaneous nh4 n and no3 n removal was investigated in a single chamber mec at low applied voltage 0 2 v reactors were initially cultured with no3 n and nh4 n to enrich the denitrification consortia for a comparative analysis the mec and the control with open circuit were constructed with similar design and were simultaneously operated under similar carbon and nitrogen loads the nitrogen removal pathways in the mec reactor were studied via on site biomass activity assessment the microstructure of the biofilm attached to biocathode was identified by using the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing technique 2 materials and methods 2 1 configuration of mec the schematic diagram of single compartment film free mec used in this study is shown in the fig 1 mec reactor is made of plexiglass which inner diameter d and height h are 60 mm and 160 mm respectively the working volume of each mec reactor is 450 ml the anode and cathode are graphite rod ø6 mm l20 mm and carbon felt 5 38 cm beijing sanye carbon co ltd respectively to retain suspended biomass each reactor was added with 15 g of activated carbon ac particles with average size of 0 42 1 00 mm the effective surface area of bioelectrode is 42 m2 m3 the carbon felt is treated with nitric acid and then rolled into a cylinder shape and fixed in the cylinder reactor the inletting port is located on the bottom of cylinder reactor which is connected with a feeding peristaltic pump after feeding the internal recirculation was maintained by using a peristaltic pump bt100 longer china 2 2 experimental design denitrifying mecs were started up by inoculating wasted active sludge collected from sewage plant two groups of experiments were set up simultaneously i e r1 open circuit and r2 closed circuit and an external power of 0 2 v was supplied in r2 with a battery test system bts 3008w 5v5ma 164 neware to facilitate the mec operation during the startup period reactors were fed with synthetic wastewater containing 500 mg l of nano3 electron acceptor and 2000 mg l of glucose carbon source and electron donor other compositions of the synthetic wastewater are listed as follow mg l 500 mg nahco3 50 mg kh2po4 33 mg feso4 7h2o 10 mg edta 4 1 mg mgso4 7h2o 1 mg cacl2 2h2o and 1 0 mg nacl after one month of startup operation the ratios of chemical oxygen demand to nitrogen cod n in synthetic wastewater were in turn adjusted to 2 1 and 0 to explore the influence of cod n ratio on denitrification efficiency in mecs as shown in table 1 the tn loading rate was basically unchanged 900 1000 g m3 d while the cod n and the ratios of no3 n no2 n nh4 n were adjusted in sequence in total five stages of experiment were included and each stage was operated for more than 30 days to realize the stability of reactors 2 3 analytical methods influent and effluent samples were collected to investigated the changes of cod no3 n no2 n and nh4

at cod n 2 stage i as shown in fig 2 a the circular mec was rapidly acclaimed to the denitrification process after 20 days of acclimation the no3 concentration of effluent has decreased to 2 mg l in both reactors r1 and r2 and the adaptability of r2 was comparatively faster than r1 when the system achieved a steady state the profiles of cod no3 no2 and nh4 were monitored as presented in fig 2b d after feeding the initial concentrations of no3 was 450 mg l which quickly decreased to 40 mg l after 3 h the specific denitrification rate was up to 166 g no3 m3 h indicating the high efficiency of denitrification in r1 and r2 during the denitrification process intermediate product no2 was immediately accumulated to 76 7 mg l and 70 5 mg l respectively in r1 and r2 after 1 h nevertheless the subsequent conversion rate of no2 to n2 in r2 was faster than that of r1 similar case was also found by zhan et al 19 about 32 59 mg l of no2 accumulated when mec was operated without applied voltage whereas it was reduced significantly when 0 2 v of voltage was applied it can be concluded that mec can improve the denitrification efficiency by inhibiting the conversion of no3 n to no2 n in the first stage of denitrification it is well known that this is the most important speed limiting factor for conventional biological nitrogen removal 20 21 in addition electrical stimulation may improve the activity of some microbial cells and provide electrons to the reaction system thus improving denitrification efficiency at the same time 22 after 6 h of process nearly all the no3 and intermediate products were completely removed thus the nrrv was calculated to be 1000 g n m3 d under hrt of 12 h actually this value might be further increased to 2000 g n m3 d if the hrt were reduced to 6 h 3 2 removal of no3 n and nh4 n under different cod n ratios at stages ii iii to explore the effect of different c n ratios on denitrification cod n 2 and cod n 1 was adjusted according to the table 1 as seen fig 3 when cod n 2 the denitrification efficiency of r2 and r1 were up to 99 4 and 97 3 meanwhile the removal rate of nh4 n were 19 1 and 22 0 when compared to fig 2 the diminishing rate of no3 n was affected by the introduction of nh4 n the specific denitrification rate was reduced to 71 4 g m3 h when changing the cod n from 2 to 1 the conversion ability of no3 n and nh4 n were both affected comparatively the impact of cod n on the denitrification efficiency in r2 was more obvious than that of r1 i e 78 7 r2 vs 99 9 r1 the overall nrrv values of cod n 2 and cod n 1 in r2 were 695 6 g m3 d and 514 5 g m3 d respectively meanwhile it also observed the different profiles of cod degradation under two cod n ratios as shown in fig 3c cod concentrations decreased with the heterotrophic denitrification and the differences between two reactors are marginal after 7 h of process cod removal efficiency was 87 0 and 83 3 respectively cod concentrations tended to increase slightly by the end of process which might be associated to the cell lysis of inoculum sludge or the extracellular polymers excreted by the high concentration of biomass contained in denitrifying mecs the active enzymes secreted by the bacteria on the biofilm can hydrolyze the organic carbon in the microbial floccule and supply the denitrifying bacteria in the anoxia condition inside the biofilm for biological denitrification 12 when cod n was adjusted to 1 the cod degradation efficiency of r2 was greater than that of r1 after 9 h of reaction cod concentrations decreased to 320 5 mg l and 202 6 mg l in r1 and r2 respectively it is found that the decomposition rate of carbon source glucose was stimulated in r2 with external electric stimulation nevertheless electrons generated from the substrate oxidation can also be utilized by other bacteria coexisted in the mec system some of the electroactive bacteria might be competed with denitrification bacteria or anammox bacteria 23 leading to the declined conversion rate of no3 n furthermore the accumulation of no2 n was also observed when decreasing cod n from 2 to 1 in r1 no2 n concentration was accumulated up to 47 3 mg l meanwhile it was only 20 3 mg l in r2 as stated previously the electric stimulation can promote the conversion rate of no2 n to n2 the previous study also reported that nitrite was easy to accumulate when c n ratio decreased to 2 nevertheless it could be diminished when the c n ratio was increased 20 21 it could be ascribed that the higher c n ratio could promote the growth of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria and then increase the total denitrification rate 3 3 roles of anammox and autotrophic denitrification in mec 3 3 1 removal of nh4 n and no2 n in mec at stage vi as previously reported no2 n could be used as the direct oxidant for anammox 24 to confirm the role of anammox and autotrophic denitrification in mec the substrates were changed to nh4 n and no2 n and no external carbon source was added as shown in fig 4 in the initial several days the removal rate of no2 n was 90 whereas the removal rate of nh4 n was quite limited after that the difference between these two substrates has gradually diminished during the acclimation period when the pseudo state was arrived the ratios of no2 n to nh4 n removed were 1 37 and 2 19 for r1 and r2 respectively fig 5 as presented in the eqs 2 4 the theoretical ratio of no2 n to nh4 n is about 1 0 1 3 in the anammox process 25 correspondingly the nitrogen removal rate of r2 was 148 7 g m3 d which was 69 4 higher than r1 indicating the enhanced activity of anammox in r2 with current stimulation the present study revealed the important roles of anammox in denitrification reactor packed with bioelectrode and the higher utilization rate of no2 n and nh4 n could be obtained in mec with current stimulation as reported by pijuan et al 5 when the mainstream anammox is exposed to cod a partial of anammox activity will be outcompeted and replaced by heterotrophic denitrification but its activity could be recovered when changing back to no cod periods similarly the anammox activity of this study was increased when cod n was reduced to 0 at stage vi 3 3 2 removal of no3 n and nh4 n in mec via autotrophic denitrification at stage v in the transition of stage iv to stage v the no2 n was replaced by no3 n as seen in fig 4 the removal rates of no3 n in r1 and r2 decreased to 16 5 and 25 0 respectively and the removal rates of nh4 n were even lower i e 8 8 and 23 8 respectively meanwhile almost no accumulation of no2 n was observed in both reactors comparing the performance of stage vi and stage v it is found that no3 n was a less effective electron acceptor than no2 n joicy et al 23 also reported that although no3 n can be used as an electron acceptor for the bioelectrochemical ammonia oxidation which rate depends on the varied fractions of no2 n and no3 n the corresponding nrrv of r2 were 49 3 g n m3 d 69 4 higher than that of r1 29 1 g m3 d without carbon source the removal of no3 n was performed via autotrophic denitrification by accepting electrons from cathode in the controlled biocathodic denitrification process no3 n is easier to be reduced in biocathodes compared to no2 n cecconet et al 18 above result indicated the lower activity of autotrophic denitrifying bacteria as compared to anammox bacteria this trend is consistent with previous reports the growth rate and reaction rate of autotrophic denitrifiers are usually quite low 11 nevertheless the application of electric field could improve the autotrophic denitrification thus the demand for external carbon source could be reduced and even under no cod condition 20 21 26 as a result of it the higher nitrogen removal rate was observed in r2 the relative activity of denitrification and anammox can also be revealed by the variations of ph fig 5 when no2 n is present the ph of both systems increased from initial 8 3 to around 9 15 whereas the lower ph range was found in reactors when no2 n was replaced by no3 n according to the eqs 2 1 2 2 and 2 3 with the increase of denitrification rate a large amount of alkalinity will be accumulated in the rector leading to the increase of ph thus the lower ph range indicated the lower reaction rate in r1 as compared to r2 according to eqs 2 4 there should be no change on the ph during the anammox process nevertheless a significant increment of ph was found at stage vi indicating the coexistence of anammox and electroactive denitrification in mec system accepting electrons from biocathode there are two pathways for denitrification in mec i e the heterotrophic denitrification using organic carbon as electron donor or the bioelectrochemical autotrophic denitrification using cathode as electron source 27 according to the calculation method reported by 20 21 the role of autotrophic denitrification was calculated and presented in table 2 the proportion of autotrophic denitrification in this experiment was up to 20 76 which was close to the denitrification efficiency shown in stage v to be concluded the simultaneous nh4 n and no3 n removal in mec is the result of combined heterotrophic denitrification autotrophic denitrification and anammox the mechanism is proposed as follows nh4 n is partially oxidized at the anode where electron can transfer

energy consumption in mec was similar to the references 30 as changing the cod n from 2 stage ii to 1 stage iii both sec n and sec v decreased evidencing the higher resistance on denitrification under

13637,in this study the performance of a circular microbial electrolysis cell mec system on removing no3 n no2 n and nh4 n at low c n ratios was investigated with the assistance of active bioelectrode electron transportation and utilization efficiency between electron donor and acceptor was enhanced in mec high rate of nitrogen removal was observed in mec at 0 2 v which was 695 6 and 514 5 g n m3 d respectively under cod n 2 and cod n 1 without carbon source addition the symbiotic activity of anammox and electrochemical autotrophic denitrifiers were verified in mec in which the demand of no2 n

denitrification and anammox can coexist and collaborate in the mec system the strict nitritation to produce only nitrite toward anammox can be avoided keywords autotrophic denitrification carbon nitrogen ratio microbial electrolysis cell nitrite accumulation partial denitrification 1 introduction the excessive use of nitrogen fertilizer in agriculture and the discharge of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater has led to a large amount of nitrogen entering into water environment worsening the water quality and threatening the human health 1 in the traditional wastewater treatment process nh4 n is converted to n2 via a two step pathway i e nitrification and denitrification nh4 n no2 n no3 n n2 2 3 in the denitrification process carbon to nitrogen ratio c n of 3 5 is necessary to support the metabolism of heterotrophic denitrification 4 when treating wastewater with low c n ratios it is common to add extra carbon source e g acetate methanol and ethanol to overcome the shortage of electron donor which makes this approach expensive and possible secondary pollution 5 thus it is essential to find new approaches to increase the electron exchange and utilization efficiency between electron donor and electron acceptor in recent years a promising approach for wastewater treatment is the application of bio electrochemical systems bes 6 7 in the microbial electrolysis cells mecs nitrification and denitrification can proceed simultaneously 8 9 at the cathode h is reduced to molecular hydrogen h2 through providing external power at a low voltage of 0 25 0 85 v which could be working as the electron donor for autotrophic denitrification 10 11 for the purpose of no3 n reduction the in situ biohydrogen production through bes would be competitive with external hydrogen supply 12 in the biocathode electroactive microorganisms can also direct accept electrons for denitrification and the electron utilization efficiency increased accordingly with the proportion of autotrophic denitrification which can reach nearly 100 13 nevertheless the biomass yield of autotrophic denitrifiers is usually low 11 in fact it is possible to combine heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrifiers within the mec system to increase the overall nitrogen removal rate in the study of zhu et al 14 the anodic oxidation of organics propionate butyrate acetate was promoted leading to a more efficient utilization rate with the limited carbon source in bioelectrochemical denitrification process the electrons could be delivered for nitrite reduction either from exoelectrogens to anode and then to denitrifying bacteria or directly from exoelectrogens to denitrifying bacteria 15 with the assistant of electrodes and electroactive bacteria a part of organic carbons utilized for other heterotrophic bacteria probably shifts to serve as electron donors for denitrification 16 as a result of it the more efficient utilization of the limited carbon sources for denitrification in low c n wastewater is expected nevertheless the removal pathways of nitrogen in mec systems subjected to varied influent substrate are distinct and the related investigation is still regarded in fancy 17 accordingly in this study the feasibility of simultaneous nh4 n and no3 n removal was investigated in a single chamber mec at low applied voltage 0 2 v reactors were initially cultured with no3 n and nh4 n to enrich the denitrification consortia for a comparative analysis the mec and the control with open circuit were constructed with similar design and were simultaneously operated under similar carbon and nitrogen loads the nitrogen removal pathways in the mec reactor were studied via on site biomass activity assessment the microstructure of the biofilm attached to biocathode was identified by using the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing technique 2 materials and methods 2 1 configuration of mec the schematic diagram of single compartment film free

cylinder reactor the inletting port is located on the bottom of cylinder reactor which is connected with a feeding peristaltic pump after feeding the internal recirculation was maintained by using a peristaltic pump bt100 longer china 2 2 experimental design denitrifying mecs were started up by inoculating wasted active sludge collected from sewage plant two groups of experiments were set up simultaneously i e r1 open circuit and r2 closed circuit and an external power of 0 2 v was supplied in r2 with a battery test system bts 3008w 5v5ma 164 neware to facilitate the mec operation during the startup period reactors were fed with synthetic wastewater containing 500 mg l of nano3 electron acceptor and 2000 mg l of glucose carbon source and electron donor other compositions of the synthetic wastewater are listed as follow mg l 500 mg nahco3 50 mg kh2po4 33 mg feso4 7h2o 10 mg edta 4 1 mg mgso4 7h2o 1 mg cacl2 2h2o and 1 0 mg nacl after one month of startup operation the ratios of chemical oxygen demand to nitrogen cod n in synthetic wastewater were in turn adjusted to 2 1 and 0 to explore the influence of cod n ratio on denitrification efficiency in mecs as shown in table 1 the tn loading rate was basically unchanged 900 1000 g m3 d while the cod n and the ratios of no3 n no2 n nh4 n were adjusted in sequence in total five stages of experiment were included and each stage was operated for more than 30 days to realize the stability of reactors 2 3 analytical methods influent and effluent samples were collected to investigated the changes of cod no3 n no2 n and nh4

at cod n 2 stage i as shown in fig 2 a the circular mec was rapidly acclaimed to the denitrification process after 20 days of acclimation the no3 concentration of effluent has decreased to 2 mg l in both reactors r1 and r2 and the adaptability of r2 was comparatively faster than r1 when the system achieved a steady state the profiles of cod no3 no2 and nh4 were monitored as presented in fig 2b d after feeding the initial concentrations of no3 was 450 mg l which quickly decreased to 40 mg l after 3 h the specific denitrification rate was up to 166 g no3 m3 h indicating the high efficiency of denitrification in r1 and r2 during the denitrification process intermediate product no2 was immediately accumulated to 76 7 mg l and 70 5 mg l respectively in r1 and r2 after 1 h nevertheless the subsequent conversion rate of no2 to n2 in r2 was faster than that of r1 similar case was also found by zhan et al 19 about 32 59 mg l of no2 accumulated when mec was operated without applied voltage whereas it was reduced significantly when 0 2 v of voltage was applied it can be concluded that mec can improve the denitrification efficiency by inhibiting the conversion of no3 n to no2 n in the first stage of denitrification it is well known that this is the most important speed limiting factor for conventional biological nitrogen removal 20 21 in addition electrical stimulation may improve the activity of some microbial cells and provide electrons to the reaction system thus improving denitrification efficiency at the same time 22 after 6 h of process nearly all the no3 and intermediate products were completely removed thus the nrrv was calculated to be 1000 g n m3 d under hrt of 12 h actually this value might be further increased to 2000 g n m3 d if the hrt were reduced to 6 h 3 2 removal of no3 n and nh4 n under different cod n ratios at stages ii iii to explore the effect of different c n ratios on denitrification cod n 2 and cod n 1 was adjusted according to the table 1 as seen fig 3 when cod n 2 the denitrification efficiency of r2 and r1 were up to 99 4 and 97 3 meanwhile the removal rate of nh4 n were 19 1 and 22 0 when compared to fig 2 the diminishing rate of no3 n was affected by the introduction of nh4 n the specific denitrification rate was reduced to 71 4 g m3 h when changing the cod n from 2 to 1 the conversion ability of no3 n and nh4 n were both affected comparatively the impact of cod n on the denitrification efficiency in r2 was more obvious than that of r1 i e 78 7 r2 vs 99 9 r1 the overall nrrv values of cod n 2 and cod n 1 in r2 were 695 6 g m3 d and 514 5 g m3 d respectively meanwhile it also observed the different profiles of cod degradation under two cod n ratios as shown in fig 3c cod concentrations decreased with the heterotrophic denitrification and the differences between two reactors are marginal after 7 h of process cod removal efficiency was 87 0 and 83 3 respectively cod concentrations tended to increase slightly by the end of process which might be associated to the cell lysis of inoculum sludge or the extracellular polymers excreted by the high concentration of biomass contained in denitrifying mecs the active enzymes secreted by the bacteria on the biofilm can hydrolyze the organic carbon in the microbial floccule and supply the denitrifying bacteria in the anoxia condition inside the biofilm for biological denitrification 12 when cod n was adjusted to 1 the cod degradation efficiency of r2 was greater than that of r1 after 9 h of reaction cod concentrations decreased to 320 5 mg l and 202 6 mg l in r1 and r2 respectively it is found that the decomposition rate of carbon source glucose was stimulated in r2 with external electric stimulation nevertheless electrons generated from the substrate oxidation can also be utilized by other bacteria coexisted in the mec system some of the electroactive bacteria might be competed with denitrification bacteria or anammox bacteria 23 leading to the declined conversion rate of no3 n furthermore the accumulation of no2 n was also observed when decreasing cod n from 2 to 1 in r1 no2 n concentration was accumulated up to 47 3 mg l meanwhile it was only 20 3 mg l in r2 as stated previously the electric stimulation can promote the conversion rate of no2 n to n2 the previous study also reported that nitrite was easy to accumulate when c n ratio decreased to 2 nevertheless it could be diminished when the c n ratio was increased 20 21 it could be ascribed that the higher c n ratio could promote the growth of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria and then increase the total denitrification rate 3 3 roles of anammox and autotrophic denitrification in mec 3 3 1 removal of nh4 n and no2 n in mec at stage vi as previously reported no2 n could be used as the direct oxidant for anammox 24 to confirm the role of anammox and autotrophic denitrification in mec the substrates were changed to nh4 n and no2 n and no external carbon source was added as shown in fig 4 in the initial several days the removal rate of no2 n was 90 whereas the removal rate of nh4 n was quite limited after that the difference between these two substrates has gradually diminished during the acclimation period when the pseudo state was arrived the ratios of no2 n to nh4 n removed were 1 37 and 2 19 for r1 and r2 respectively fig 5 as presented in the eqs 2 4 the theoretical ratio of no2 n to nh4 n is about 1 0 1 3 in the anammox process 25 correspondingly the nitrogen removal rate of r2 was 148 7 g m3 d which was 69 4 higher than r1 indicating the enhanced activity of anammox in r2 with current stimulation the present study revealed the important roles of anammox in denitrification reactor packed with bioelectrode and the higher utilization rate of no2 n and nh4 n could be obtained in mec with current stimulation as reported by pijuan et al 5 when the mainstream anammox is exposed to cod a partial of anammox activity will be outcompeted and replaced by heterotrophic denitrification but its activity could be recovered when changing back to no cod periods similarly the anammox activity of this study was increased when cod n was reduced to 0 at stage vi 3 3 2 removal of no3 n and nh4 n in mec via autotrophic denitrification at stage v in the transition of stage iv to stage v the no2 n was replaced by no3 n as seen in fig 4 the removal rates of no3 n in r1 and r2 decreased to 16 5 and 25 0 respectively and the removal rates of nh4 n were even lower i e 8 8 and 23 8 respectively meanwhile almost no accumulation of no2 n was observed in both reactors comparing the performance of stage vi and stage v it is found that no3 n was a less effective electron acceptor than no2 n joicy et al 23 also reported that although no3 n can be used as an electron acceptor for the bioelectrochemical ammonia oxidation which rate depends on the varied fractions of no2 n and no3 n the corresponding nrrv of r2 were 49 3 g n m3 d 69 4 higher than that of r1 29 1 g m3 d without carbon source the removal of no3 n was performed via autotrophic denitrification by accepting electrons from cathode in the controlled biocathodic denitrification process no3 n is easier to be reduced in biocathodes compared to no2 n cecconet et al 18 above result indicated the lower activity of autotrophic denitrifying bacteria as compared to anammox bacteria this trend is consistent with previous reports the growth rate and reaction rate of autotrophic denitrifiers are usually quite low 11 nevertheless the application of electric field could improve the autotrophic denitrification thus the demand for external carbon source could be reduced and even under no cod condition 20 21 26 as a result of it the higher nitrogen removal rate was observed in r2 the relative activity of denitrification and anammox can also be revealed by the variations of ph fig 5 when no2 n is present the ph of both systems increased from initial 8 3 to around 9 15 whereas the lower ph range was found in reactors when no2 n was replaced by no3 n according to the eqs 2 1 2 2 and 2 3 with the increase of denitrification rate a large amount of alkalinity will be accumulated in the rector leading to the increase of ph thus the lower ph range indicated the lower reaction rate in r1 as compared to r2 according to eqs 2 4 there should be no change on the ph during the anammox process nevertheless a significant increment of ph was found at stage vi indicating the coexistence of anammox and electroactive denitrification in mec system accepting electrons from biocathode there are two pathways for denitrification in mec i e the heterotrophic denitrification using organic carbon as electron donor or the bioelectrochemical autotrophic denitrification using cathode as electron source 27 according to the calculation method reported by 20 21 the role of autotrophic denitrification was calculated and presented in table 2 the proportion of autotrophic denitrification in this experiment was up to 20 76 which was close to the denitrification efficiency shown in stage v to be concluded the simultaneous nh4 n and no3 n removal in mec is the result of combined heterotrophic denitrification autotrophic denitrification and anammox the mechanism is proposed as follows nh4 n is partially oxidized at the anode where electron can transfer from exoelectrogens to the anode and then to denitrifying bacteria at the cathode via circuit or directly from exoelectrogens to denitrifying bacteria in recent years coupling partial denitrification no3 n no2 n and anammox process has also been received growing interest for nitrogen removal from wastewater in the denitrifying ammonium oxidation process a high nitrogen removal efficiency of 93 6 was obtained with influent no3 n to nh4 n ratio of 1 0 28 nevertheless different environmental conditions are required for the partial denitrification process and anammox process thus these two processes are usually carried out in sequencing batch reactor leading to the limited n loading rate direct interspecies electron transfers between the ammonia oxidizing exoelectrogens and the denitrifying electrotrophs in the bulk solution were found in an anaerobic reactor equipped with bioelectrode polarized at 0 6 v for nitrogen removal and the requirement of no2 n for the removal of ammonium is found to be 0 58 g no2 n g nh4 n 29 in present study the demand of no2 n for the nh4 n removal is calculated to be 1 3 which difference might be associated to the different microbial communities 3 4 electric performance and energy consumption the current densities observed in r2 under different c n ratios stages ⅱ ⅲ and ⅴ are calculated to be 26 3 11 6 and 6 3 ma m2 which are similar to these values e g 20 200 ma reported by cecconet et al 30 in the biocathodic denitrification process the higher current density will appear in the reactor with a higher voltage of power supply or catalyst anode e g pt or pt ir the current density of tested reactor indicates that carbon felt cathode is favorable for the development of electroactive biofilm fig 6 compared energy

energy consumption in mec was similar to the references 30 as changing the cod n from 2 stage ii to 1 stage iii both sec n and sec v decreased evidencing the higher resistance on denitrification under lower cod n and leading to the reduced electron exchange between donor and acceptor the highest current density and volumetric energy consumption rate sec v occurred at stage i which are corresponding to the higher rate of nrr v nevertheless the maximum secn was found at stage ii indicating that a higher proportion of electrons in the denitrification process came from the biocathode 3 5

tmped 24 mg g 1 cr vi sba aptes 51 mg g 1 cr vi sba tmped 55 mg g 1 cr vi sba mptms 55 mg g 1 se vi sba aptes 79 mg g 1 se vi sba tmped 78 mg g 1 se vi sba mptms 31 mg g 1 xps studies proved that adsorption of as v cr vi and se vi onto amine and thiol functionalized sba 15 leads to the reduction of adsorbate and various chemical changes of sorbent functional groups it was shown that the 0 5 mol l 1 chloride solution prevents the adsorption of as v and cr vi onto sba aptes and sba tmped materials and only slightly hinders adsorption of se vi nitrate ions have a lesser influence on the adsorption of as v cr vi and se vi than chloride ions the application of hno3 and hcl of various concentrations do not allow to quantitatively desorb as se and cr from studied sorbents the results suggest that amine and thiol functionalized mesoporous silica could be used as effective adsorbents for the removal of as v cr vi or se vi from aqueous solution keywords adsorption mesoporous silica arsenic selenium chromium removal 1 introduction water pollution with toxic metal ions has become one of the most serious environmental problems the metal ions enter into water through human activities and by natural means 1 besides highly toxic cations such as cd ii pb ii hg ii also oxyanions of as v aso4 3 cr vi cro4 2 cr2o7 2 and se vi seo4 2 can pose a significant risk to human health 2 as v and cr vi ions are known as prominently toxic and carcinogenic se vi is toxic if the permissible dose is exceeded according to the world health organization who recommendations the concentration of as cr and se in drinking water should not be higher than 0 01 mg l 1 0 05 mg l 1 and 0 01 mg l 1 respectively 3 unfortunately in many regions of the world the recommended concentration values have been exceeded which is often the result of the geological structure of the ground 4 numerous techniques including membrane separation electrochemical treatment solvent extraction ion exchange adsorption and precipitation have been developed to ensure the high effectiveness of water purification 5 7 each of these methods has advantages and disadvantages in the case of precipitation the main limitation is slow metal precipitation and the production of a large amount of sludge the application of ion exchange or membrane filtration involves high costs additionally in the case of membrane filtration the purification is prolonged due to the low flow rate the effectiveness of treatment with the use of quite expensive electrochemical methods depends on the ph among wastewater treatment techniques adsorption technology seems to be the most promising one the most important advantages of adsorption are the simplicity of operation and the possibility of using low cost materials 8 numerous adsorbents including functionalized polymers 9 various types of nanomaterials 10 11 iron based nanoparticles 12 biosorbents 13 biochar 14 graphene based materials 15 metal organic frameworks 16 have been used for oxyanions removal among them silica materials deserve special attention 17 sorption can be realized by using amorphous silicas or silicas with mesoporous structure wherein ordered mesoporous silicas usually possess higher surface areas that ensure higher adsorption capacities 18 20 due to high surface area high hydrothermal and mechanical stability tunable pore size and simplicity of both synthesis and surface modification ordered mesoporous sba 15 type silica materials are extremely popular 21 to achieve effective sorption organic ligands are often used for sba 15 surface modification which results in the creation of organic inorganic hybrid material thanks to the right choice of modifying agent it is possible to obtain materials showing an affinity for specific ions or molecules 22 pristine 23 and modified sba 15 has been widely used for removal of single heavy metal cations such as cr iii 24 pb 25 26 cu ii 23 25 26 cd ii 27 hg ii 28 co ii and sr ii 29 ni ii 26 30 generally less attention has been paid to the use of sba 15 for removing toxic anions however numerous publications on removing as iii v 31 34 se iv vi 35 and cr vi 36 37 by metal oxide modified sba 15 are also available there are only a few publications concerning the application of post synthesis amine and thiol functionalized sba 15 for removal of as v 17 38 se vi 35 or cr vi 17 38 41 although the adsorption of toxic anions by post synthesis modified sba 15 is satisfactory the application of sba 15 modified by co condensation seems to be cheaper and more environmentally friendly i have undertaken the adsorption of as v se vi and cr vi onto amine and thiol modified sba 15 obtained by co condensation of silica precursor and functionalizing monomer because the synthesis of these materials does not require any complicated instrumentation or toxic organic solvents used when sba 15 is modified by post grating technique preparation of modified sba 15 by one pot synthesis is easy and most of the waste generated during the synthesis ethyl alcohol block copolymer and unreacted monomers is reusable the aim of this work was to compare the adsorption ability of three organosilica hybrid sba 15 type materials functionalized with 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane aptes n 3 trimethoxysilyl propyl ethylenediamine tmped and 3 mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane mptms towards as v cr vi and se vi ions the effect of ph and agitation time on the adsorption of as v cr vi and se vi ions has been investigated additionally adsorption isotherms selectivity and the mechanism of adsorption have been studied the results presented in this paper will provide an opportunity to evaluate the adsorption properties of one step synthesized modified sba 15 in relation to toxic anions 2 experimental 2 1 reagents the following compounds were used during the research tetraethoxysilane teos 99 abcr germany 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane aptes 98 abcr germany n 3

have been described by us in the past 42 44 in this work the adsorption ability of sba 15 materials synthesized from 18 mmol of teos and 2 mmol of aptes sba aptes tmped sba tmped and mptms sba mptms towards as v cr vi and se vi ions as well as the sorption mechanisms have been evaluated 2 3 instruments x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps technique was used for adsorption mechanisms investigations the measurements of binding energy were performed on multi chamber analytical system prevac poland equipped with monochromatic kα al radiation 1486 6 ev gammadata scienta sweden and an x ray power of 450 w pressure in the analysis chamber was not higher than 8 10 9 pa the carbon c1s peak at 285 ev was considered as a reference survey scans were registered in the energy range of 0 1200 ev high resolution spectra were collected over the 40 50 52 60 100 107 161 170 194 205 281 292 396 411 525 540 and 572 580 ev ranges for as 3d se 3d si 2p s 2p cl 2p c 1s n 1s o 1s and cr 2p regions respectively casaxps was used for data analysis measurements of relatively low arsenic chromium and selenium concentrations in the initial solutions used for the preparation of adsorption systems and in residual equilibrium solutions of studied adsorption systems were carried out using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer gf aas spectr aa 800z varian australia with zeeman background correction system the measurements of high arsenic chromium and selenium concentration in solutions prepared for the adsorption studies and in some residual solutions separated from the adsorption systems were performed using flame atomic absorption spectrometer f aas spectr aa800 varian australia equipped with an air acetylene burner the operating parameters of the gf aas and f aas spectrometer are presented in table se1 ph measurements were realized by using cp 401 ph meter elmetron poland equipped with eps 1 combined glass electrode the point of zero charge of functionalized sba 15 samples was determined by the batch equilibration method 45 using kcl 0 01 and 0 1 mol l 1 as an electrolyte the initial ph values were adjusted by additions of small volumes of hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide solutions the erlenmeyer flasks containing 0 01 g sorbent and 10 ml of kcl solutions of various ph values were stirred mechanically for 24 h 2 4 adsorption studies adsorption studies were carried out in a batch mode adsorption systems consisting of 5 mg of sorbent and 5 ml of solution were stirred at 22 c 0 5 c the initial ph of the solutions was fixed by the addition of various volumes of 0 5 20 naoh or hno3 solutions after reaching the equilibrium state the sorbent was separated from the solution by centrifugation the concentration of as v cr vi and se vi ions in the solutions was measured by using gf aas or f aas the values of adsorption were calculated based on the following equation 1 a c i c v m where c i is the initial concentration of adsorbed ions mg l 1 c is the equilibrium concentration mg l 1 v is the volume of the solution l and m is the mass of the adsorbent g 2 4 1 ph optimization the optimization of ph was achieved by using the solutions of constant adsorbate concentration 10 4 and 20 mg l 1 for as v cr vi and se vi respectively and various initial ph values the initial ph was adjusted in the range between 0 5 and 10 4 after 24 h of the suspension stirring the equilibrium ph value of the liquid phase was measured 2 4 2 kinetic studies adsorption systems used for kinetic studies consisted of 50 mg of sorbent and 50 ml of as v cr vi or se vi ions solution after a strictly defined stirring time 1 ml of suspension was taken and the concentration of the adsorbate in the liquid phase was measured the initial concentrations of as v were equal to 4 mg l 1 in the case of se vi the initial concentration was 40 mg l 1 and 10 mg l 1 for thiol sba mptms and amine functionalized sba aptes sba tmped materials respectively whereas for cr vi these values were 4 and 8 mg l 1 in order to ensure the optimal adsorption conditions the initial ph of the solution was adjusted to 4 2 for as v sba aptes and as v sba tmped 3 5 for cr vi sba aptes and cr vi sba mptms 2 7 for cr vi sba tmped 3 2 for se vi sba aptes and se vi sba tmped 2 2 for se vi sba mptms the initial ph values were established based on the relation presented in fig 1 2 4 3 adsorption isotherms the initial concentrations of as v cr vi and se vi ions used for adsorption isotherm studies were in the range of 2 130 3 600 and 0 2 500 mg l 1 respectively ph values were the same as for kinetic studies the adsorption systems were stirred with an equilibrium time of 10 min 2 4 4 influence of nitrates and chlorides the series of the solutions of the same concentration of as v cr vi or se vi and various concentrations of nitrates or chlorides kno3 and nacl were prepared the initial concentrations of as v cr vi and se vi were equal to 40 6 50 mg l 1 respectively the concentrations of nitrates and chlorides varied in the range of 0 001 1 and 0 001 3 mol l 1 respectively the percentage values of adsorption were calculated by comparing obtained adsorption values with the adsorption obtained for similar suspensions without any addition of kno3 and nacl ph values were the same as for kinetic studies the adsorption systems were stirred with an equilibrium time of 10 min 2 4 5 desorption studies nitric and hydrochloric acids in the concentration ranges of 0 5 14 and 0 5 10 mol l 1 respectively were tested as as cr and se desorptive media 0 4 0 6 mg sorbent containing a well known amount of adsorbed as cr or se was shaken with 1 ml of desorptive agent for 24 h the concentration of as cr or se was measured in the supernatant by aas 3 results 3 1 characterization synthesis and full characterization e g sem ftir tem pores size distribution of the materials have been described previously 42 44 the most important structural parameters of the studied modified sba 15 are presented in table 1 all studied materials have a specific surface area higher than 600 m2 g 1 thus the introduction of aptes tmped and mptms into the sorbent structure does not lead to the drastic decrease of the sba 15 type sorbent surface the similarity between structural parameters of the two amine modified materials can be observed whereas thiol modified material is characterized by lower values of specific surface area pore volume and pore diameter sba mptms was synthesized with higher functionalization efficiency 81 5 compared to sba aptes and sba tmped materials 56 7 and 51 5 respectively the significant efficiency of functionalization indicates the potential possibility of using these materials as adsorbents of metal or metalloid ions which exhibit strong adsorption affinity towards amine or thiol groups 3 2 adsorption results 3 2 1 ph optimization the surface charge of the sorbent and the speciation form of the separated ions strongly depend on the ph of the solution thus ph is a key factor influencing the adsorption to determine the phpzc the salt addition method 45 was applied it was stated that sba aptes sba tmped and sba mptms possess negative charges for equilibrium ph over 4 0 3 8 and 3 2 respectively below these values sorbents are charged positively in order to establish the optimal value of ph which ensures the highest efficiency of as v cr vi and se vi removal the model studies concerning the influence of ph on the adsorption have been undertaken the influence of the equilibrium ph on the adsorption of as v cr vi and se vi onto sba aptes sba tmped and sba mptms is presented in fig 1 as can be seen in fig 1a sba mptms material does not adsorb as v anions at all also amine modified sba 15 materials do not adsorb as v in strongly acidic conditions ph 2 in which the h3aso4 molecule is the dominant form of as v for these materials the highest adsorption is observed in the equilibrium ph range between 3 3 3 7 and 3 3 6 8 for sba aptes and sba tmped respectively in this range as v is present mainly as h2aso4 anions which are electrostatically attracted by protonated amine groups present on the sba aptes and sba tmped 46 xps studies of sba aptes and sba tmped sorbents containing adsorbed arsenic showed that the adsorption process led to the partial reduction of as v to as iii described in detail in section 3 2 5 the reduction was accompanied by the release of free h into the solution reflected in the decrease of the solution ph value after sorption in fig 2 the relation of ph equilibrium vs ph initial is shown the effect of equilibrium ph on cr vi adsorption onto studied materials is shown in fig 1b cr vi ions are adsorbed by both amine and thiol modified sba 15 however for ph lower than 1 3 the adsorption of cr vi occurs only onto sba mptms surface whereas amine modified sba 15 does not adsorb cr vi the adsorption of cr vi ions onto sba aptes and sba tmped materials is observed only for ph exceeding 1 35 for both amine modified sorbents the adsorption increases with increasing ph reaching a plateau in the range of the equilibrium ph of 1 9 3 7 for sba tmped and 3 1 4 0 for sba aptes material in a more basic solution a decrease in adsorption is observed in solutions of ph below 0 7 the only form of cr vi is the h2cro4 molecule in more basic solutions at ph below 6 5 mainly hcro4 are observed wherein at ph over 6 cro4 2 ions appear 47 under the optimal ph value amine groups present on the sorbent surface are protonated by h according to the reaction 2 r n h 2 h r n h 3 and electrostatically attract hcro4 anions for ph over 4 the protonation decreases which results in less attraction of the adsorbed anions taking into account the ph range ensuring the highest adsorption values it was found that the sorbents containing amine groups have the strongest affinity for hcro4 ions 47 contrary to amine modified sba 15 sba mptms adsorbs cr vi even at very low ph values about 1 1 adsorption increases with ph increasing from 1 1 to 4 2 reaches plateau between 4 2 and 6 1 then slightly decreases fig 1b thiol modified sba 15 is likely to reduce cr vi in the presence of h according to the reaction 3 s i o 2 s h 2 h c r o 4 8 h s i o 2 s o 3 h 2 c r 3 5 h 2 o thus the reaction is privileged to proceed in the presence of h 48 in fig 2 b the plot of equilibrium ph versus initial ph obtained for cr vi adsorption is presented for low initial ph values 2 4 the changes in equilibrium ph are negligible in the range of initial ph between 3 5 and 6 1 ph changed to become less acidic which can be a result of the consumption of h ions for reduction of cr vi according to the eq 3 fig 1c presents se vi adsorption at various equilibrium ph values sba aptes and sba tmped materials show the highest adsorption affinity with respect to se vi ions in the equilibrium ph range of 2 7 3 6 both the decrease and the increase of the ph of the adsorption systems containing studied amine modified silica sorbents beyond the above mentioned range is associated with a significant decrease of the adsorption of se vi ions in acidic solutions ph 2 5 three forms of hexavalent selenium coexist simultaneously i e h2seo4 hseo4 and seo4 2 in the ph range of 2 5 4 0 hseo4 and seo4 2 anions can be identified whereas for ph 4 only fully deprotonated seo4 2 is observed 49 therefore it can be concluded that mainly hseo4 ions are adsorbed on the surface of sba 15 modified with monomers containing amine groups adsorption of seo4 2 occurs with less efficiency which may be associated with deprotonation of amine groups at higher ph and decrease of electrostatic attraction between adsorbed anions and sorbent surface the adsorption of se vi on sba aptes and sba tmped from solutions of an initial ph higher than 3 6 is accompanied by the decrease of the equilibrium ph value this effect occurring for all adsorbed ions considered in this study is most likely the result of the binding of h released from protonated amine groups by hydroxyl groups present in the aqueous solutions this process and the exchange of h between the material surface and the solution lead to a decrease in the ph of the aqueous phase sba mptms material compared to sba aptes and sba tmped allows for efficient sorption of se vi ions in a much wider ph range the most efficient adsorption of se vi ions on sba mptms material is obtained in the equilibrium ph range from 1 2 to 4 5 which proves that the considered material has a high affinity for both hseo4 ions and h2seo4 molecule the adsorption of se vi ions in the initial ph range between 3 7 and 6 3 is accompanied by an increase in the equilibrium ph compared to the initial ph value fig 2c it could be explained by the consumption of protons for reduction of se vi to se 0 which is confirmed by xps studies the decrease in the concentration of h for initial ph higher than 6 3 is probably the result of the binding of some h by seo4 2 ions leading to the formation of hseo4 which is efficiently adsorbed by sba mptms material taking into account the influence of ph on the adsorption of as v cr vi and se vi further experiments were performed at initial ph values providing the highest possible adsorption presented in table 2 3 2 2 kinetic studies fig 3 depicts the adsorption kinetics of as v cr vi and se vi onto sba aptes sba tmped and sba mptms fig 3a shows the influence of time on the adsorption of as v ions onto sba aptes sba tmped materials for both systems adsorption equilibrium is achieved after a few minutes of stirring in further studies on as v adsorption the stirring time was 10 min the relationships presented in fig 3b prove that the adsorption of cr vi ions onto all studied sorbents was rapid for all studied systems the equilibrium state was established after 1 min of contact of the adsorbent with the solution for further cr vi adsorption studies the stirring time of the adsorption systems was 10 min regardless of the type of modified sba sorbent similarly short times are required to achieve adsorption equilibrium of se vi onto sba aptes and sba tmped in the case of sba mptms 3 min are needed for equilibrium reaching in order to ensure the equilibrium of the adsorption process further experiments were performed with 10 min of stirring the kinetic experimental data were subjected to an in depth analysis by using kinetic equations i e pseudo first order kinetic equation 50 4 ln a e q a t l n a e q k 1 t the pseudo second order kinetic equation 50 5 t a t 1 k 2 a e q 2 1 a e q t and intraparticle diffusion model equation 6 a e q k 2 t 1 2 c where at mg g 1 is the amount adsorbed at time t aeq is the amount adsorbed at equilibrium state the k1 min 1 k2 g mg 1 min 1 and k3 g mg 1 min 1 are the rate constants of the pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion equations respectively c mg g 1 constant characterizes diffusion through the film of the solution on the sorbent surface pseudo first order pseudo second order kinetic isotherm and intraparticle diffusion plots are shown in fig s1 fig s2 and fig s3 supplementary material respectively the values calculated from fig s1 fig s2 and fig s3 are recorded in table 3 the parameters presented in table 3 and the relation presented in fig s1 indicate that the adsorption mechanism does not fit well with the pseudo first order model the r2 parameters significantly differ from one adsorption values calculated on the basis of the pseudo first order equation also are not close to experimental values thus it can be concluded that adsorption of as v cr vi and se vi is not caused by physical interactions 51 the adsorption also can not be described by the intraparticle diffusion model as evidenced by the values of the r2 parameter significantly different from unity the adsorption results fit well with the pseudo second order kinetic model which proves the physicochemical nature of the process the r2 parameters are equal to 1 additionally the calculated adsorption values are almost identical to the experimental results 3 2 3 adsorption isotherms in fig 4 adsorption isotherms of as v cr vi and se vi onto sba aptes sba tmped and sba mptms are presented in the case of as v adsorption is observed only for amine modified sorbents the maximum static adsorption capacities obtained for sba aptes and sba tmped are equal to 36 and 24 mg g 1 respectively in the range of low initial concentrations 10 mg l 1 about 85 90 of as v removal efficiency is obtained as presented in fig 4b the adsorption capacity of sba aptes sba tmped and sba mptms exhibited with respect to cr vi ions is about 53 mg g 1 regardless of the kind of sorbent the shape of all three adsorption isotherms of cr vi is practically the same unfortunately for low values of initial concentrations complete removal of chromium from the solution is not observed se vi adsorption isotherms obtained for the material modified with thiol groups and for materials modified with amine groups are characterized by a completely different course sorbents modified with amine groups do not allow the complete removal of se vi from the aqueous phase however nearly quantitative separation of se vi from solutions of its low concentrations 20 mg l 1 is provided for adsorption systems containing sba mptms sorbent maximum static adsorption capacities of se vi obtained for sba aptes sba tmped and sba mptms are equal to 81 79 and 31 mg g 1 respectively the experimental adsorption isotherms data were fitted to langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich d r and temkin model according to the equations 7 c e q a 1 k l a m c e q a m 8 ln a ln k f 1 n ln c e q 9 l n a l n a d r k d r ε 2 ε r t l n 1 1 c e q 10 a r t b t l

adsorbent surface sorption capacity k l is the langmuir constant k f n k d r k t are empirical constants a d r theoretical d r isotherm saturation capacity r 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 is the gas constant t k is the absolute temperature bt is the temkin isotherm constant related to the heat of sorption 52 the numerical parameters obtained from langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich and temkin equations are summarized in table 4 whereas fig s4 fig s5 fig s6 and fig s7 shows langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich and temkin fitting curves for isothermal adsorption respectively based on the r2 values presented in table 4 it can be concluded that as v adsorption is well described by the monolayer langmuir model the experimentally obtained as v adsorption values are in good agreement with the monolayer adsorption capacity calculated according to the linear langmuir equation monolayer chemisorption is also responsible for the removal of cr vi ions by sba aptes and sba tmped as well as se vi ions by sba mptms the better fit of the freundlich model to the experimental data is observed in the case of adsorption of cr vi onto sba mptms and se vi onto sba aptes and sba tmped surfaces good matching of the experimental data to the freundlich model proves the surface energetic heterogeneity in relation to the adsorbed ions none of the tested systems is correctly described by the dubinin radushkevich or temkin model 3 2 4 influence of nitrates and chlorides to evaluate the influence of coexisting anions nitrates and chlorides on the adsorption of as v cr vi and se vi onto sba aptes sba tmped and sba mptms model studies have been carried out the results of the experiments are shown in fig 5 the presence of 0 1 mol l 1 no3 decrease the adsorption of as v onto sba aptes and sba tmped at about 70 and 55 the negative influence of chlorides is even stronger in the presence of 1 mol l 1 cl adsorption of as v onto sba aptes practically does not occur whereas onto sba tmped decreases at about 80 compared to that obtained for the chlorides free solution in the case of cr vi the presence of 0 1 1 mol l 1 nitrates decreases adsorption at about 40 60 regardless of the kind of sorbent the presence of 0 5 mol l 1 chlorides leads to a complete stop of cr vi adsorption onto amine modified sba 15 cr vi adsorption onto sba mptms is only slightly 35 decrease limited by chlorides the influence of chlorides and nitrates on the adsorption of se vi is the weakest compared to cr vi and as v the adsorption of se vi onto amine modified sorbents decreases by about 40 and 25 in the presence of 0 1 mol l 1 nitrates and chlorides respectively in the case of sba mptms adsorption of se vi decreases only at about 10 under the influence of chlorides nitrates do not cause a decrease of se vi adsorption onto thiol modified material the decrease of as v cr vi and se vi in the presence of anions such as chlorides or nitrates is probably caused by competitive adsorption of coexisting anions the number of adsorption centers on the sorbent surface is limited in the presence of an excess of anions with high affinity for the sorbent the adsorption centers can be completely saturated with competing ions which is observed in the case of adsorption of as v and cr vi from the solutions containing over 0 5 mol l 1 chlorides when the adsorption affinity for the coexisting ion is stronger the lower ion concentration causes a decrease in adsorbate uptake 3 2 5 xps studies the mechanism of adsorption has been investigated by comparison of xps spectra of as synthesized sba aptes sba tmped and sba mptms sorbents with xps spectra of as cr or se species loaded materials 3 2 5 1 xps of pristine sorbents in fig s8 the overview spectrum of sba aptes sba tmped and sba mptms materials is shown the presence of amine and thiol groups on the sorbent surfaces is reflected by their characteristic peaks marked in fig s8 peaks representing the chemical states of oxygen o 1s 528 536 ev and o 2s 24 26 ev nitrogen n 1s 396 406 ev carbon c 1s 281 291 ev chlorine cl 2p 195 205 ev and silicon si 2p 100 107 ev are observed on the xps spectra of sba aptes and sba tmped materials on the spectrum registered for sba mptms material no peaks are representing the electron binding energy in nitrogen atoms however besides the peaks assigned to carbon chlorine oxygen and silicon there are peaks characteristic of sulfur s 2p 160 173 ev in fig 6 detailed spectra of n 1s regions of sba aptes and sba tmped are presented in the case of sba aptes three forms of nitrogen represented by n 1s peaks with maximum at 400 1 401 7 and 402 7 ev are observed similar peaks with maximum at 399 9 401 4 and 402 7 ev are registered for sba tmped for both amine modified materials the peaks of lowest energies are assigned to unprotonated amine groups the protonated amine groups are represented by the peaks of medium binding energy whereas the peaks with maxima at 402 7 ev are assigned to protonated imine groups 53 54 in the case of sba mptms besides peaks characteristic for oxygen carbon chlorine and silicon the peaks derived from sulfur at 163 5 s 2p 3 2 and 164 7 s 2p ½ ev are observed and attributed to sulfur in the form of thiol groups 55 3 2 5 2 xps of ion loaded sorbents in order to define the chemical form in which as v was adsorbed onto sba aptes and sba tmped surfaces xps studies of as loaded materials were performed fig 7 shows as 3d region of sba aptes and sba tmped materials containing 36 and 31 mg g 1 as respectively the presence of an intensive 3d 5 2 peak at 45 1 ev indicates as v presence as iii was also identified on the surface of both studied materials the binding energy for the 3d 5 2 level is 42 7 43 2 ev however its percentage is only about 11 of the total adsorbed amount 56 thus it can be concluded that 11 of as v was reduced to as iii as a result of adsorption the analysis of n 1s region of as loaded materials which is presented in fig 7 shows that both in the case of sba aptes and sba tmped material the nitrogen present on their surface occurs in 4 states they correspond to the presence of cyanide groups 398 9 398 6 ev amine groups 399 8 399 9 ev protonated amine groups 400 9 401 5 ev and protonated imine groups 402 2 403 1 ev based on cr 2p region of cr loaded sba aptes fig 8 a and cr loaded sba tmped fig 8b spectra it can be concluded that cr vi is reduced to cr iii as a result of adsorption onto amine modified silica the presence of cr iii is indicated by cr 2p 3 2 peaks with maxima at 577 8 ev and 578 1 ev for cr loaded sba aptes fig 8a and cr loaded sba tmped fig 8b respectively 57 there are no peaks proving the presence of hexavalent chromium in the case of cr vi adsorption onto sba aptes there are no significant changes in the xps spectrum of n1 s region after sorption unprotonated amine groups 400 1 ev protonated amine groups 401 6 ev and protonated imine groups 402 7 ev are identified fig 8d the same groups are identified onto cr loaded sba tmped however in this case also no2 species reflected by n 1s peak at 407 9 ev fig 8e are present 58 xps spectra of cr 2p region presented in fig 8 c shows two 2p 3 2 peaks at 577 5 ev 57 and 579 8 ev 47 the first of the peaks corresponds to chromium at the third state of oxidation whereas the second is attributed to the hexavalent chromium cr iii is predominant form of metal it makes up 85 of the total amount of metal whereas cr vi only 15 the reduction of cr vi to cr iii is accompanied with partial oxidation of sh groups as evidenced by the presence of oxidized sulfur onto cr loaded sba mptms surface the confirmation of the presence of oxidized sulfur is 2p 3 2 peak at 167 9 ev in s 2p region of cr loaded sba mptms fig 8f 55 unchanged thiol groups are attributed to 2p 3 2 peak at 163 2 ev by comparing the intensity of the peaks it can be concluded that 90 of the sulfur is present as thiol groups and only 10 is bonded with oxygen as can be seen in fig 9 d and e adsorption of se vi onto amine functionalized sba 15 does not cause significant changes in the nitrogen chemical states however one can see that the intensity of peaks at about 400 ev increases as a result of se vi adsorption which indicates the increase of the ratio of unprotonated amine groups the intensity of peaks at about 401 5 and 402 5 ev decreases at the same time selenium adsorption onto sba aptes and sba tmped is accompanied by its partial reduction to se 0 and se iv se 0 is reflected by the 3d 5 2 peak at 56 ev in the case of both amine modified materials in the xps spectrum of se region of se loaded sba aptes and sba tmped 3d 5 2 peaks attributed to se iv and se vi are also identified at about 59 2 and 60 3 ev respectively however the intensity of these peaks is significantly lower compared to the intensity obtained for se 0 thus se 0 is the predominant form of selenium onto sba aptes and sba tmped surfaces the reduction of se vi to se 0 is also observed when sba mptms is used for adsorption onto thiol functionalized surface only se 0 represented by 3d 5 2 peak at 55 9 ev is present adsorption of se vi onto sba mptms leads to the partial oxidation and simultaneous reduction of sulfur originally present as thiol groups the presence of sulfides thiols and sulfites is proved by s 2p 3 2 peaks at 162 2 163 4 and 168 ev respectively 59 the mass percent ratio of sulfides thiol sulfites onto se loaded sba mptms surface equals 17 75 8 55 3 2 6 desorption studies in fig 10 the influence of various concentrations of nitric and hydrochloric acid on the desorption of as cr and se species from studied sorbents is shown the highest adsorption efficiency is obtained in the case of as it reaches 92 with 10 mol l 1 hcl and 80 with 14 mol l 1 hno3 desorption of cr species from amine functionalized does not exceed 57 for sba mptms is lower than for amine functionalized materials furthermore se is not desorbed quantitatively the highest achieved value of se desorption was equal to 61 for the system containing 14 mol l 1 and se loaded sba mptms desorption of as cr and se species in acidic conditions is caused due to the increasing concentration of h a significant increase in the concentration of h results in the formation of a positive charge on the sorbent surface the positive surface charge may cause anion repulsion and desorption of anionic species additionally the decrease of ph being the result of the addition of inorganic acids influence the speciation of adsorbed species which also may be the reason of desorption for example the presence of concentrated nitric acid may result in the oxidation of as iii and cr iii present on the sorbent surface to as v and cr vi respectively moreover as mentioned in section 3 2 1 ph is the key factor determining the protonation of arsenates chromates and selenates the increase of as cr and se concentration in the liquid phase can be also caused by partial leaching of the silica framework 60 the desorption mechanism is therefore complex 4 conclusion amine and thiol functionalized mesoporous silica could be used as effective sorbents for the removal of as v cr vi and se vi ions the materials ensure an extremely short time required for adsorption equilibrium reaching the adsorption affinity for all adsorbents has been found to be affected by ph for most materials effective adsorption is observed in the equilibrium ph range between 2 and 5 which corresponds to an even wider range of initial ph under optimal ph values the maximum static adsorption capacities were as follows as v sba aptes 36 mg g 1 as v sba tmped 24 mg g 1 cr vi sba aptes 51 mg g 1 cr vi sba tmped 55 mg g 1 cr vi sba mptms 55 mg g 1 se vi sba aptes 79 mg g 1 se vi sba tmped 78 mg g 1 se vi sba mptms 31 mg g 1 xps studies proved that adsorption of as v cr vi and se vi onto amine and thiol functionalized leads to the reduction of adsorbate and various chemical changes of sorbent functional groups it was shown that the 0 5 mol l 1 chloride solution prevents the adsorption of as v and cr vi onto sba aptes and sba tmped materials and only slightly hinders adsorption of se vi nitrate ions have a lesser influence on the adsorption of as v cr vi and se vi than chloride ions the application of hno3 and hcl of various concentrations do not allow to quantitatively desorb as se and cr from the studied sorbents declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest appendix a supplementary data supplementary material related to this article can

13638,sba 15 type materials functionalized with 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane aptes n 3 trimethoxysilyl propyl ethylenediamine tmped and 3 mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane mptms have been compared for their ability to adsorb arsenic v chromium vi and selenium vi oxyanions from an aqueous solution the effects of ph and contact time on the adsorption of as v cr vi and se vi were studied adsorption was very fast a maximum of 3 min was required to reach adsorption equilibrium under the optimal ph values the maximum static adsorption capacities were as follows as v sba aptes 36 mg g 1 as v sba

adsorption of as v cr vi and se vi onto amine and thiol functionalized sba 15 leads to the reduction of adsorbate and various chemical changes of sorbent functional groups it was shown that the 0 5 mol l 1 chloride solution prevents the adsorption of as v and cr vi onto sba aptes and sba tmped materials and only slightly hinders adsorption of se vi nitrate ions have a lesser influence on the adsorption of as v cr vi and se vi than chloride ions the application of hno3 and hcl of various concentrations do not allow to quantitatively desorb as se and cr from studied sorbents the results suggest that amine and thiol functionalized mesoporous silica could be used as effective adsorbents for the removal of as v cr vi or se vi from aqueous solution keywords adsorption mesoporous silica arsenic selenium chromium removal 1 introduction water pollution with toxic metal ions has become one of the most serious environmental problems the metal ions enter into water through human activities and by natural means 1 besides highly toxic cations such as cd ii pb ii hg ii also oxyanions of as v aso4 3 cr vi cro4 2 cr2o7 2 and se vi seo4 2 can pose a significant risk to human health 2 as v and cr vi ions are known as prominently toxic and carcinogenic se vi is toxic if the permissible dose is exceeded according to the world health organization who recommendations the concentration of as cr and se in drinking water should not be higher than 0 01 mg l 1 0 05 mg l 1 and 0 01 mg l 1 respectively 3 unfortunately in many regions of the world the recommended concentration values have been exceeded which is often the result of the geological structure of the ground 4 numerous techniques including membrane separation electrochemical treatment solvent extraction ion exchange adsorption and precipitation have been developed to ensure the high effectiveness of water purification 5 7 each of these methods has advantages and disadvantages in the case of precipitation the main limitation is slow metal precipitation and the production of a large amount of sludge the application of ion exchange or membrane filtration involves high costs additionally in the case of membrane filtration the purification is prolonged due to the low flow rate the effectiveness of treatment with the use of quite expensive electrochemical methods depends on the ph among wastewater treatment techniques adsorption technology seems to be the most promising one the most important advantages of adsorption are the simplicity of operation and the possibility of using low cost materials 8 numerous adsorbents including functionalized polymers 9 various types of nanomaterials 10 11 iron based nanoparticles 12 biosorbents 13 biochar 14 graphene based materials 15 metal organic frameworks 16 have been used for oxyanions removal among them silica materials deserve special attention 17 sorption can be realized by using amorphous silicas or silicas with mesoporous structure wherein ordered mesoporous silicas usually possess higher surface areas that ensure higher adsorption capacities 18 20 due to high surface area high hydrothermal and mechanical stability tunable pore size and simplicity of both synthesis and surface modification ordered mesoporous sba 15 type silica materials are extremely popular 21 to achieve effective sorption organic ligands are often used for sba 15 surface modification which results in the creation of organic inorganic hybrid material thanks to the right choice of modifying agent it is possible to obtain materials showing an affinity for specific ions or molecules 22 pristine 23 and modified sba 15 has been widely used for removal of single heavy metal cations such as cr iii 24 pb 25 26 cu ii 23 25 26 cd ii 27 hg ii 28 co ii and sr ii 29 ni ii 26 30 generally less attention has been paid to the use of sba 15 for removing toxic anions however numerous publications on removing as iii v 31 34 se iv vi 35 and cr vi 36 37 by metal oxide modified sba 15 are also available there are only a few publications concerning the application of post synthesis amine and thiol functionalized sba 15 for removal of as v 17 38 se vi 35 or cr vi 17 38 41 although the adsorption of toxic anions by post synthesis modified sba 15 is satisfactory the application of sba 15 modified by co condensation seems to be cheaper and more environmentally friendly i have undertaken the adsorption of as v se vi and cr vi onto amine and thiol modified sba 15 obtained by co condensation of silica precursor and functionalizing monomer because the synthesis of these materials does not require any complicated instrumentation or toxic organic solvents used when sba 15 is modified by post grating technique preparation of modified sba 15 by one pot synthesis is easy and most of the waste generated during the synthesis ethyl alcohol block copolymer and unreacted monomers is reusable the aim of this work was to compare the adsorption ability of three organosilica hybrid sba 15 type materials functionalized with 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane aptes n 3 trimethoxysilyl propyl ethylenediamine tmped and 3 mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane mptms towards as v cr vi and se vi ions the effect of ph and agitation time on the adsorption of as v cr vi and se vi ions has been investigated additionally adsorption isotherms selectivity and the mechanism of adsorption have been studied the results presented in this paper will provide an opportunity to evaluate the adsorption properties of one step synthesized modified sba 15 in relation to toxic anions 2 experimental 2 1 reagents the following compounds were used during the research tetraethoxysilane teos 99 abcr germany 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane aptes 98 abcr germany n 3

towards as v cr vi and se vi ions as well as the sorption mechanisms have been evaluated 2 3 instruments x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps technique was used for adsorption mechanisms investigations the measurements of binding energy were performed on multi chamber analytical system prevac poland equipped with monochromatic kα al radiation 1486 6 ev gammadata scienta sweden and an x ray power of 450 w pressure in the analysis chamber was not higher than 8 10 9 pa the carbon c1s peak at 285 ev was considered as a reference survey scans were registered in the energy range of 0 1200 ev high resolution spectra were collected over the 40 50 52 60 100 107 161 170 194 205 281 292 396 411 525 540 and 572 580 ev ranges for as 3d se 3d si 2p s 2p cl 2p c 1s n 1s o 1s and cr 2p regions respectively casaxps was used for data analysis measurements of relatively low arsenic chromium and selenium concentrations in the initial solutions used for the preparation of adsorption systems and in residual equilibrium solutions of studied adsorption systems were carried out using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer gf aas spectr aa 800z varian australia with zeeman background correction system the measurements of high arsenic chromium and selenium concentration in solutions prepared for the adsorption studies and in some residual solutions separated from the adsorption systems were performed using flame atomic absorption spectrometer f aas spectr aa800 varian australia equipped with an air acetylene burner the operating parameters of the gf aas and f aas spectrometer are presented in table se1 ph measurements were realized by using cp 401 ph meter elmetron poland equipped with eps 1 combined glass electrode the point of zero charge of functionalized sba 15 samples was determined by the batch equilibration method 45 using kcl 0 01 and 0 1 mol l 1 as an electrolyte the initial ph values were adjusted by additions of small volumes of hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide solutions the erlenmeyer flasks containing 0 01 g sorbent and 10 ml of kcl solutions of various ph values were stirred mechanically for 24 h 2 4 adsorption studies adsorption studies were carried out in a batch mode adsorption systems consisting of 5 mg of sorbent and 5 ml of solution were stirred at 22 c 0 5 c the initial ph of the solutions was fixed by the addition of various volumes of 0 5 20 naoh or hno3 solutions after reaching the equilibrium state the sorbent was separated from the solution by centrifugation the concentration of as v cr vi and se vi ions in the solutions was measured by using gf aas or f aas the values of adsorption were calculated based on the following equation 1 a c i c v m where c i is the initial concentration of adsorbed ions mg l 1 c is the equilibrium concentration mg l 1 v is the volume of the solution l and m is the mass of the adsorbent g 2 4 1 ph optimization the optimization of ph was achieved by using the solutions of constant adsorbate concentration 10 4 and 20 mg l 1 for as v cr vi and se vi respectively and various initial ph values the initial ph was adjusted in the range between 0 5 and 10 4 after 24 h of the suspension stirring the equilibrium ph value of the liquid phase was measured 2 4 2 kinetic studies adsorption systems used for kinetic studies consisted of 50 mg of sorbent and 50 ml of as v cr vi or se vi ions solution after a strictly defined stirring time 1 ml of suspension was taken and the concentration of the adsorbate in the liquid phase was measured the initial concentrations of as v were equal to 4 mg l 1 in the case of se vi the initial concentration was 40 mg l 1 and 10 mg l 1 for thiol sba mptms and amine functionalized sba aptes sba tmped materials respectively whereas for cr vi these values were 4 and 8 mg l 1 in order to ensure the optimal adsorption conditions the initial ph of the solution was adjusted to 4 2 for as v sba aptes and as v sba tmped 3 5 for cr vi sba aptes and cr vi sba mptms 2 7 for cr vi sba tmped 3 2 for se vi sba aptes and se vi sba tmped 2 2 for se vi sba mptms the initial ph values were established based on the relation presented in fig 1 2 4 3 adsorption isotherms the initial concentrations of as v cr vi and se vi ions used for adsorption isotherm studies were in the range of 2 130 3 600 and 0 2 500 mg l 1 respectively ph values were the same as for kinetic studies the adsorption systems were stirred with an equilibrium time of 10 min 2 4 4 influence of nitrates and chlorides the series of the solutions of the same concentration of as v cr vi or se vi and various concentrations of nitrates or chlorides kno3 and nacl were prepared the initial concentrations of as v cr vi and se vi were equal to 40 6 50 mg l 1 respectively the concentrations of nitrates and chlorides varied in the range of 0 001 1 and 0 001 3 mol l 1 respectively the percentage values of adsorption were calculated by comparing obtained adsorption values with the adsorption obtained for similar suspensions without any addition of kno3 and nacl ph values were the same as for kinetic studies the adsorption systems were stirred with an equilibrium time of 10 min 2 4 5 desorption studies nitric and hydrochloric acids in the concentration ranges of 0 5 14 and 0 5 10 mol l 1 respectively were tested as as cr and se desorptive media 0 4 0 6 mg sorbent containing a well known amount of adsorbed as cr or se was shaken with 1 ml of desorptive agent for 24 h the concentration of as cr or se was measured in the supernatant by aas 3 results 3 1 characterization synthesis and full characterization e g sem ftir tem pores size distribution of the materials have been described previously 42 44 the most important structural parameters of the studied modified sba 15 are presented in table 1 all studied materials have a specific surface area higher than 600 m2 g 1 thus the introduction of aptes tmped and mptms into the sorbent structure does not lead to the drastic decrease of the sba 15 type sorbent surface the similarity between structural parameters of the two amine modified materials can be observed whereas thiol modified material is characterized by lower values of specific surface area pore volume and pore diameter sba mptms was synthesized with higher functionalization efficiency 81 5 compared to sba aptes and sba tmped materials 56 7 and 51 5 respectively the significant efficiency of functionalization indicates the potential possibility of using these materials as adsorbents of metal or metalloid ions which exhibit strong adsorption affinity towards amine or thiol groups 3 2 adsorption results 3 2 1 ph optimization the surface charge of the sorbent and the speciation form of the separated ions strongly depend on the ph of the solution thus ph is a key factor influencing the adsorption to determine the phpzc the salt addition method 45 was applied it was stated that sba aptes sba tmped and sba mptms possess negative charges for equilibrium ph over 4 0 3 8 and 3 2 respectively below these values sorbents are charged positively in order to establish the optimal value of ph which ensures the highest efficiency of as v cr vi and se vi removal the model studies concerning the influence of ph on the adsorption have been undertaken the influence of the equilibrium ph on the adsorption of as v cr vi and se vi onto sba aptes sba tmped and sba mptms is presented in fig 1 as can be seen in fig 1a sba mptms material does not adsorb as v anions at all also amine modified sba 15 materials do not adsorb as v in strongly acidic conditions ph 2 in which the h3aso4 molecule is the dominant form of as v for these materials the highest adsorption is observed in the equilibrium ph range between 3 3 3 7 and 3 3 6 8 for sba aptes and sba tmped respectively in this range as v is present mainly as h2aso4 anions which are electrostatically attracted by protonated amine groups present on the sba aptes and sba tmped 46 xps studies of sba aptes and sba tmped sorbents containing adsorbed arsenic showed that the adsorption process led to the partial reduction of as v to as iii described in detail in section 3 2 5 the reduction was accompanied by the release of free h into the solution reflected in the decrease of the solution ph value after sorption in fig 2 the relation of ph equilibrium vs ph initial is shown the effect of equilibrium ph on cr vi adsorption onto studied materials is shown in fig 1b cr vi ions are adsorbed by both amine and thiol modified sba 15 however for ph lower than 1 3 the adsorption of cr vi occurs only onto sba mptms surface whereas amine modified sba 15 does not adsorb cr vi the adsorption of cr vi ions onto sba aptes and sba tmped materials is observed only for ph exceeding 1 35 for both amine modified sorbents the adsorption increases with increasing ph reaching a plateau in the range of the equilibrium ph of 1 9 3 7 for sba tmped and 3 1 4 0 for sba aptes material in a more basic solution a decrease in adsorption is observed in solutions of ph below 0 7 the only form of cr vi is the h2cro4 molecule in more basic solutions at ph below 6 5 mainly hcro4 are observed wherein at ph over 6 cro4 2 ions appear 47 under the optimal ph value amine groups present on the sorbent surface are protonated by h according to the reaction 2 r n h 2 h r n h 3 and electrostatically attract hcro4 anions for ph over 4 the protonation decreases which results in less attraction of the adsorbed anions taking into account the ph range ensuring the highest adsorption values it was found that the sorbents containing amine groups have the strongest affinity for hcro4 ions 47 contrary to amine modified sba 15 sba mptms adsorbs cr vi even at very low ph values about 1 1 adsorption increases with ph increasing from 1 1 to 4 2 reaches plateau between 4 2 and 6 1 then slightly decreases fig 1b thiol modified sba 15 is likely to reduce cr vi in the presence of h according to the reaction 3 s i o 2 s h 2 h c r o 4 8 h s i o 2 s o 3 h 2 c r 3 5 h 2 o thus the reaction is privileged to proceed in the presence of h 48 in fig 2 b the plot of equilibrium ph versus initial ph obtained for cr vi adsorption is presented for low initial ph values 2 4 the changes in equilibrium ph are negligible in the range of initial ph between 3 5 and 6 1 ph changed to become less acidic which can be a result of the consumption of h ions for reduction of cr vi according to the eq 3 fig 1c presents se vi adsorption at various equilibrium ph values sba aptes and sba tmped materials show the highest adsorption affinity with respect to se vi ions in the equilibrium ph range of 2 7 3 6 both the decrease and the increase of the ph of the adsorption systems containing studied amine modified silica sorbents beyond the above mentioned range is associated with a significant decrease of the adsorption of se vi ions in acidic solutions ph 2 5 three forms of hexavalent selenium coexist simultaneously i e h2seo4 hseo4 and seo4 2 in the ph range of 2 5 4 0 hseo4 and seo4 2 anions can be identified whereas for ph 4 only fully deprotonated seo4 2 is observed 49 therefore it can be concluded that mainly hseo4 ions are adsorbed on the surface of sba 15 modified with monomers containing amine groups adsorption of seo4 2 occurs with less efficiency which may be associated with deprotonation of amine groups at higher ph and decrease of electrostatic attraction between adsorbed anions and sorbent surface the adsorption of se vi on sba aptes and sba tmped from solutions of an initial ph higher than 3 6 is accompanied by the decrease of the equilibrium ph value this effect occurring for all adsorbed ions considered in this study is most likely the result of the binding of h released from protonated amine groups by hydroxyl groups present in the aqueous solutions this process and the exchange of h between the material surface and the solution lead to a decrease in the ph of the aqueous phase sba mptms material compared to sba aptes and sba tmped allows for efficient sorption of se vi ions in a much wider ph range the most efficient adsorption of se vi ions on sba mptms material is obtained in the equilibrium ph range from 1 2 to 4 5 which proves that the considered material has a high affinity for both hseo4 ions and h2seo4 molecule the adsorption of se vi ions in the initial ph range between 3 7 and 6 3 is accompanied by an increase in the equilibrium ph compared to the initial ph value fig 2c it could be explained by the consumption of protons for reduction of se vi to se 0 which is confirmed by xps studies the decrease in the concentration of h for initial ph higher than 6 3 is probably the result of the binding of some h by seo4 2 ions leading to the formation of hseo4 which is efficiently adsorbed by sba mptms material taking into account the influence of ph on the adsorption of as v cr vi and se vi further experiments were performed at initial ph values providing the highest possible adsorption presented in table 2 3 2 2 kinetic studies fig 3 depicts the adsorption kinetics of as v cr vi and se vi onto sba aptes sba tmped and sba mptms fig 3a shows the influence of time on the adsorption of as v ions onto sba aptes sba tmped materials for both systems adsorption equilibrium is achieved after a few minutes of stirring in further studies on as v adsorption the stirring time was 10 min the relationships presented in fig 3b prove that the adsorption of cr vi ions onto all studied sorbents was rapid for all studied systems the equilibrium state was established after 1 min of contact of the adsorbent with the solution for further cr vi adsorption studies the stirring time of the adsorption systems was 10 min regardless of the type of modified sba sorbent similarly short times are required to achieve adsorption equilibrium of se vi onto sba aptes and sba tmped in the case of sba mptms 3 min are needed for equilibrium reaching in order to ensure the equilibrium of the adsorption process further experiments were performed with 10 min of stirring the kinetic experimental data were subjected to an in depth analysis by using kinetic equations i e pseudo first order kinetic equation 50 4 ln a e q a t l n a e q k 1 t the pseudo second order kinetic equation 50 5 t a t 1 k 2 a e q 2 1 a e q t and intraparticle diffusion model equation 6 a e q k 2 t 1 2 c where at mg g 1 is the amount adsorbed at time t aeq is the amount adsorbed at equilibrium state the k1 min 1 k2 g mg 1 min 1 and k3 g mg 1 min 1 are the rate constants of the pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion equations respectively c mg g 1 constant characterizes diffusion through the film of the solution on the sorbent surface pseudo first order pseudo second order kinetic isotherm and intraparticle diffusion plots are shown in fig s1 fig s2 and fig s3 supplementary material respectively the values calculated from fig s1 fig s2 and fig s3 are recorded in table 3 the parameters presented in table 3 and the relation presented in fig s1 indicate that the adsorption mechanism does not fit well with the pseudo first order model the r2 parameters significantly differ from one adsorption values calculated on the basis of the pseudo first order equation also are not close to experimental values thus it can be concluded that adsorption of as v cr vi and se vi is not caused by physical interactions 51 the adsorption also can not be described by the intraparticle diffusion model as evidenced by the values of the r2 parameter significantly different from unity the adsorption results fit well with the pseudo second order kinetic model which proves the physicochemical nature of the process the r2 parameters are equal to 1 additionally the calculated adsorption values are almost identical to the experimental results 3 2 3 adsorption isotherms in fig 4 adsorption isotherms of as v cr vi and se vi onto sba aptes sba tmped and sba mptms are presented in the case of as v adsorption is observed only for amine modified sorbents the maximum static adsorption capacities obtained for sba aptes and sba tmped are equal to 36 and 24 mg g 1 respectively in the range of low initial concentrations 10 mg l 1 about 85 90 of as v removal efficiency is obtained as presented in fig 4b the adsorption capacity of sba aptes sba tmped and sba mptms exhibited with respect to cr vi ions is about 53 mg g 1 regardless of the kind of sorbent the shape of all three adsorption isotherms of cr vi is practically the same unfortunately for low values of initial concentrations complete removal of chromium from the solution is not observed se vi adsorption isotherms obtained for the material modified with thiol groups and for materials modified with amine groups are characterized by a completely different course sorbents modified with amine groups do not allow the complete removal of se vi from the aqueous phase however nearly quantitative separation of se vi from solutions of its low concentrations 20 mg l 1 is provided for adsorption systems containing sba mptms sorbent maximum static adsorption capacities of se vi obtained for sba aptes sba tmped and sba mptms are equal to 81 79 and 31 mg g 1 respectively the experimental adsorption isotherms data were fitted to langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich d r and temkin model according to the equations 7 c e q a 1 k l a m c e q a m 8 ln a ln k f 1 n ln c e q 9 l n a l n a d r k d r ε 2 ε r t l n 1 1 c e q 10 a r t b t l

are summarized in table 4 whereas fig s4 fig s5 fig s6 and fig s7 shows langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich and temkin fitting curves for isothermal adsorption respectively based on the r2 values presented in table 4 it can be concluded that as v adsorption is well described by the monolayer langmuir model the experimentally obtained as v adsorption values are in good agreement with the monolayer adsorption capacity calculated according to the linear langmuir equation monolayer chemisorption is also responsible for the removal of cr vi ions by sba aptes and sba tmped as well as se vi ions by sba mptms the better fit of the freundlich model to the experimental data is observed in the case of adsorption of cr vi onto sba mptms and se vi onto sba aptes and sba tmped surfaces good matching of the experimental data to the freundlich model proves the surface energetic heterogeneity in relation to the adsorbed ions none of the tested systems is correctly described by the dubinin radushkevich or temkin model 3 2 4 influence of nitrates and chlorides to evaluate the influence of coexisting anions nitrates and chlorides on the adsorption of as v cr vi and se vi onto sba aptes sba tmped and sba mptms model studies have been carried out the results of the experiments are shown in fig 5 the presence of 0 1 mol l 1 no3 decrease the adsorption of as v onto sba aptes and sba tmped at about 70 and 55 the negative influence of chlorides is even stronger in the presence of 1 mol l 1 cl adsorption of as v onto sba aptes practically does not occur whereas onto sba tmped decreases at about 80 compared to that obtained for the chlorides free solution in the case of cr vi the presence of 0 1 1 mol l 1 nitrates decreases adsorption at about 40 60 regardless of the kind of sorbent the presence of 0 5 mol l 1 chlorides leads to a complete stop of cr vi adsorption onto amine modified sba 15 cr vi adsorption onto sba mptms is only slightly 35 decrease limited by chlorides the influence of chlorides and nitrates on the adsorption of se vi is the weakest compared to cr vi and as v the adsorption of se vi onto amine modified sorbents decreases by about 40 and 25 in the presence of 0 1 mol l 1 nitrates and chlorides respectively in the case of sba mptms adsorption of se vi decreases only at about 10 under the influence of chlorides nitrates do not cause a decrease of se vi adsorption onto thiol modified material the decrease of as v cr vi and se vi in the presence of anions such as chlorides or nitrates is probably caused by competitive adsorption of coexisting anions the number of adsorption centers on the sorbent surface is limited in the presence of an excess of anions with high affinity for the sorbent the adsorption centers can be completely saturated with competing ions which is observed in the case of adsorption of as v and cr vi from the solutions containing over 0 5 mol l 1 chlorides when the adsorption affinity for the coexisting ion is stronger the lower ion concentration causes a decrease in adsorbate uptake 3 2 5 xps studies the mechanism of adsorption has been investigated by comparison of xps spectra of as synthesized sba aptes sba tmped and sba mptms sorbents with xps spectra of as cr or se species loaded materials 3 2 5 1 xps of pristine sorbents in fig s8 the overview spectrum of sba aptes sba tmped and sba mptms materials is shown the presence of amine and thiol groups on the sorbent surfaces is reflected by their characteristic peaks marked in fig s8 peaks representing the chemical states of oxygen o 1s 528 536 ev and o 2s 24 26 ev nitrogen n 1s 396 406 ev carbon c 1s 281 291 ev chlorine cl 2p 195 205 ev and silicon si 2p 100 107 ev are observed on the xps spectra of sba aptes and sba tmped materials on the spectrum registered for sba mptms material no peaks are representing the electron binding energy in nitrogen atoms however besides the peaks assigned to carbon chlorine oxygen and silicon there are peaks characteristic of sulfur s 2p 160 173 ev in fig 6 detailed spectra of n 1s regions of sba aptes and sba tmped are presented in the case of sba aptes three forms of nitrogen represented by n 1s peaks with maximum at 400 1 401 7 and 402 7 ev are observed similar peaks with maximum at 399 9 401 4 and 402 7 ev are registered for sba tmped for both amine modified materials the peaks of lowest energies are assigned to unprotonated amine groups the protonated amine groups are represented by the peaks of medium binding energy whereas the peaks with maxima at 402 7 ev are assigned to protonated imine groups 53 54 in the case of sba mptms besides peaks characteristic for oxygen carbon chlorine and silicon the peaks derived from sulfur at 163 5 s 2p 3 2 and 164 7 s 2p ½ ev are observed and attributed to sulfur in the form of thiol groups 55 3 2 5 2 xps of ion loaded sorbents in order to define the chemical form in which as v was adsorbed onto sba aptes and sba tmped surfaces xps studies of as loaded materials were performed fig 7 shows as 3d region of sba aptes and sba tmped materials containing 36 and 31 mg g 1 as respectively the presence of an intensive 3d 5 2 peak at 45 1 ev indicates as v presence as iii was also identified on the surface of both studied materials the binding energy for the 3d 5 2 level is 42 7 43 2 ev however its percentage is only about 11 of the total adsorbed amount 56 thus it can be concluded that 11 of as v was reduced to as iii as a result of adsorption the analysis of n 1s region of as loaded materials which is presented in fig 7 shows that both in the case of sba aptes and sba tmped material the nitrogen present on their surface occurs in 4 states they correspond to the presence of cyanide groups 398 9 398 6 ev amine groups 399 8 399 9 ev protonated amine groups 400 9 401 5 ev and protonated imine groups 402 2 403 1 ev based on cr 2p region of cr loaded sba aptes fig 8 a and cr loaded sba tmped fig 8b spectra it can be concluded that cr vi is reduced to cr iii as a result of adsorption onto amine modified silica the presence of cr iii is indicated by cr 2p 3 2 peaks with maxima at 577 8 ev and 578 1 ev for cr loaded sba aptes fig 8a and cr loaded sba tmped fig 8b respectively 57 there are no peaks proving the presence of hexavalent chromium in the case of cr vi adsorption onto sba aptes there are no significant changes in the xps spectrum of n1 s region after sorption unprotonated amine groups 400 1 ev protonated amine groups 401 6 ev and protonated imine groups 402 7 ev are identified fig 8d the same groups are identified onto cr loaded sba tmped however in this case also no2 species reflected by n 1s peak at 407 9 ev fig 8e are present 58 xps spectra of cr 2p region presented in fig 8 c shows two 2p 3 2 peaks at 577 5 ev 57 and 579 8 ev 47 the first of the peaks corresponds to chromium at the third state of oxidation whereas the second is attributed to the hexavalent chromium cr iii is predominant form of metal it makes up 85 of the total amount of metal whereas cr vi only 15 the reduction of cr vi to cr iii is accompanied with partial oxidation of sh groups as evidenced by the presence of oxidized sulfur onto cr loaded sba mptms surface the confirmation of the presence of oxidized sulfur is 2p 3 2 peak at 167 9 ev in s 2p region of cr loaded sba mptms fig 8f 55 unchanged thiol groups are attributed to 2p 3 2 peak at 163 2 ev by comparing the intensity of the peaks it can be concluded that 90 of the sulfur is present as thiol groups and only 10 is bonded with oxygen as can be seen in fig 9 d and e adsorption of se vi onto amine functionalized sba 15 does not cause significant changes in the nitrogen chemical states however one can see that the intensity of peaks at about 400 ev increases as a result of se vi adsorption which indicates the increase of the ratio of unprotonated amine groups the intensity of peaks at about 401 5 and 402 5 ev decreases at the same time selenium adsorption onto sba aptes and sba tmped is accompanied by its partial reduction to se 0 and se iv se 0 is reflected by the 3d 5 2 peak at 56 ev in the case of both amine modified materials in the xps spectrum of se region of se loaded sba aptes and sba tmped 3d 5 2 peaks attributed to se iv and se vi are also identified at about 59 2 and 60 3 ev respectively however the intensity of these peaks is significantly lower compared to the intensity obtained for se 0 thus se 0 is the predominant form of selenium onto sba aptes and sba tmped surfaces the reduction of se vi to se 0 is also observed when sba mptms is used for adsorption onto thiol functionalized surface only se 0 represented by 3d 5 2 peak at 55 9 ev is present adsorption of se vi onto sba mptms leads to the partial oxidation and simultaneous reduction of sulfur originally present as thiol groups the presence of sulfides thiols and sulfites is proved by s 2p 3 2 peaks at 162 2 163 4 and 168 ev respectively 59 the mass percent ratio of sulfides thiol sulfites onto se loaded sba mptms surface equals 17 75 8 55 3 2 6 desorption studies in fig 10 the influence of various concentrations of nitric and hydrochloric acid on the desorption of as cr and se species from studied sorbents is shown the highest adsorption efficiency is obtained in the case of as it reaches 92 with 10 mol l 1 hcl and 80 with 14 mol l 1 hno3 desorption of cr species from amine functionalized does not exceed 57 for sba mptms is lower than for amine functionalized materials furthermore se is not desorbed quantitatively the highest achieved value of se desorption was equal to 61 for the system containing 14 mol l 1 and se loaded sba mptms desorption of as cr and se species in acidic conditions is caused due to the increasing concentration of h a significant increase in the concentration of h results in the formation of a positive charge on the sorbent surface the positive surface charge may cause anion repulsion and desorption of anionic species additionally the decrease of ph being the result of the addition of inorganic acids influence the speciation of adsorbed species which also may be the reason of desorption for example the presence of concentrated nitric acid may result in the oxidation of as iii and cr iii present on the sorbent surface to as v and cr vi respectively moreover as mentioned in section 3 2 1 ph is the key factor determining the protonation of arsenates chromates and selenates the increase of as cr and se concentration in the liquid phase can be also caused by partial leaching of the silica framework 60 the desorption mechanism is therefore complex 4 conclusion amine and thiol functionalized mesoporous silica could be used as effective sorbents for the removal of as v cr vi and se vi ions the materials ensure an extremely short time required for adsorption equilibrium reaching the adsorption affinity for all adsorbents has been found to be affected by ph for most materials effective adsorption is observed in the equilibrium ph range between 2 and 5 which corresponds to an even wider range of initial ph under optimal ph values the maximum static adsorption capacities were as follows as v sba aptes 36 mg g 1 as v sba tmped 24 mg g 1 cr vi sba aptes 51 mg g 1 cr vi sba tmped 55 mg g 1 cr vi sba mptms 55 mg g 1 se vi sba aptes 79 mg g 1 se vi sba tmped 78 mg g 1 se vi sba mptms 31 mg g 1 xps studies proved that adsorption of as v cr vi and se vi onto amine and thiol functionalized leads to the reduction of adsorbate and various chemical changes of sorbent functional groups it was shown that the 0 5 mol l 1 chloride solution prevents the adsorption of as v and cr vi onto sba aptes and sba tmped materials and only slightly hinders adsorption of se vi nitrate ions have a lesser influence on the adsorption of as v cr vi and se vi than chloride ions the application of hno3 and hcl of various concentrations do not allow to quantitatively desorb as se and cr from the studied sorbents declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest appendix a supplementary data supplementary material related to this article can

13639,severe organic pollution in surface water worldwide has put forward higher requirements for new water treatment technologies due to the characteristics of large specific surface areas and strong adsorption of organic matters granular activated carbon has been widely used in water treatment currently little research has been carried out on comprehensive evaluation models for the adsorption and hardness of activated carbon coursing in a lack of a scientific and comprehensive selection process twenty one kinds of activated carbon briquetted carbon cylindrical carbon cylindrical broken carbon and broken carbon produced by seven companies were selected in this study a comprehensive evaluation model of activated carbon water purification performance was developed this study not only contained static and dynamic adsorption tests but also included hardness characteristic analysis and the analytic hierarchy process ahp was used to determine the weight of each factor the results indicated that briquetted carbon performed best in terms of comprehensive performance of activated carbon to be followed by cylindrical carbon cylindrical broken carbon and broken carbon consecutively owing to the highest total pore volume 0 581 m3 g 1 and the highest content of oxygen containing functional groups the best performance of briquetted carbon was corroborated by the analysis of physicochemical properties and the model was reasonable the research provides a theoretical basis that has important implications for the optimization selection of activated carbon keywords activated carbon optimization advanced water treatment process static adsorption dynamic adsorption 1 introduction more and more surface water sources have been polluted by industrial livestock and agricultural wastewater discharge increases in organic inorganic and microbial contamination in source water bring in concern of water quality 1 including color taste odor biological instability as well as disinfection byproducts dbps 2 7 thus drinking water safety has become a priority for environmental communities worldwide the water treatment process plays an essential role in reducing serious illnesses associated with waterborne diseases although traditional water treatment processes are excellent for the removal of some contaminants such as suspended solids colloidal substances and bacteria from water they are still unable to satisfy the requirements of progressively higher drinking water quality standards especially with regard to the removal of organic and emerging contaminants 8 10 due to the high specific surface area and hydrophobic interactions as compared to conventional materials activated carbon shows high potential for controlling heavy metals organic pollutants and microorganism removal in drinking water 11 13 and effectively improve water quality 14 the ozone activated carbon has been widely used in water purification processes 15 the granular activated carbon gac has been listed as the most effective technique to deal with 51 organic pollutants in the united states environmental protection agency usepa drinking water standard 16 the selection of granular activated carbon and its operation and maintenance has become the research hotspots in the ozone activated carbon process 17 the basis of its selection and parameter optimization is crucial at present most researchers consider the evaluation of a single type of activated carbon mainly based on the physical properties specific surface area pore volume particle size and strength ash content water content loading density etc and the indicators of adsorption capacity iodine value methylene blue 18 19 carbon tetrachloride adsorption capacity etc 20 21 however there are many different types of activated carbon the evaluation methods of the characteristics and removal performance of activated carbon have not been comprehensively investigated leading to the lack of scientific and overall selection of carbon species based on static and dynamic adsorption assays combined with the hardness characteristics analyses we conducted a bench experiment to select excellent activated carbon in this paper it developed a comprehensive evaluation method of the performance of activated carbon for water purification 2 experimental methods and materials 2 1 experimental materials twenty one kinds of activated carbon including briquetted carbon cylindrical carbon cylindrical broken carbon and broken carbon produced by seven companies were selected as shown in table 1 they were numbered in accordance with the manufacturers and their categories to carry out a test of blind selection the corresponding manufacturing information was shown in table s1 2 2 the static adsorption assay static adsorption includes iodine adsorption value and methylene blue adsorption value the iodine adsorption value was determined following the test method for granular activated carbon from coal determination of iodine adsorption gb t 7702 7 2008 22 and the determination of the methylene blue adsorption value was determined following test method for granular activated carbon from coal determination of methylene blue adsorption gb t 7702 6 2008 23 24 2 3 the dynamic adsorption assay the device for the activated carbon dynamic adsorption consisted of a regulating water tank a peristaltic pump river yz15 and an activated carbon column as shown in fig 1 the activated carbon column has an inner diameter of 15 mm and a length of 600 mm from bottom to top 10 20 mm gravel particle size 6 8 mm and 300 mm optional granular activated carbon were sequentially packed stone and optional granular activated carbon were washed with distilled water before filling the wet packing method was specified for filling the tap water was used as feedwater and sodium thiosulfate was added to the tap water 1 2 1 to neutralize the remaining chlorine in this paper the water flowed past the activated carbon column from top to bottom as shown in fig 1 the flow rate was 9 m h water quality parameters including turbidity uv254 and doc were tested from the inlet and outlet water 2 4 the hardness assay the hardness of activated carbon was carried out according to the test method for granular activated carbon from coal determination of hardness gb t 7702 3 2008 25 the activated carbon sample was put into a unique instrument equipped with a certain number of stainless steel balls rotated and regularly beat the sample s mass retained on the assay sieve after the assay accounts for the percentage of the sample s total mass as the hardness of the activated carbon 2 5 detection of pore size and surface area of activated carbon activated carbon pore size and surface area parameters were detected by the constant temperature gas adsorption method according to bet brunauer emmett teller and t plot curves the specific surface area micropore specific surface area and pore volume of activated carbon were obtained the specific surface area and pore analysis of activated carbon adopt micromeritics with the model asap 2020 v4 03 2 6 infrared spectroscopy detection of functional groups on the activated carbon surface a fourier transform infrared spectrometry analyzer nicolet 5700 thermo scientific was used for the qualitative detection of functional group types on the surface of activated carbon the scanning range was 400 4000 cm 1 and the resolution was 1 cm 1 2 7 boehm titration of functional group content on the activated carbon surface the most important functional groups on the surface of activated carbon include carboxyl lactone carbonyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups which are acidic in water and can be quantified by alkaline liquid titration with different intensities according to the boehm titration method 26 28 nahco3 can neutralize carboxyl groups na2co3 can neutralize carboxyl and lactone groups and naoh can neutralize carboxyl lactone and phenolic hydroxyl groups so the content of carboxyl lactone and phenolic hydroxyl groups can be calculated by titration with nahco3 na2co3 and naoh solutions respectively the operation of the boehm titration method in this study was modified based on the previous assay 2 8 the analytic hierarchy process ahp ahp is a systematic and hierarchical analysis method that combines qualitative and quantitative approaches it is a systematic and hierarchical approach to analyse a system that consists of many factors that are inter related and inter constrained and lack of quantitative data the ahp analysis we used which was divided into four steps 1 establishing a recursive hierarchy 2 constructing a judgment matrix in each level 3 single ranking and consistency check and 4 total ranking and consistency check in this study the decision objective of the hierarchy is the optimal activated carbon selection scheme g we determined that the criterion layer a contains static adsorption index a1 dynamic adsorption index a2 and hardness index a3 the judgment matrix constructed by comparing the strong and weak relationships between factors on the influence of the decision problem and the consistency of the test results of the matrix judged by the consistency ratio cr and the consistency quantification index ci 2 9 other analytical measurements a total organic carbon analyzer toc lcph was used to measure the doc of water samples a uv vis spectrophotometer thermo evolution 201 was used to measure the uv254 ibm spss statistics 25 conducted with microsoft excel software package microsoft corporation usa was used to compare the statistical difference between two sets of data linear regression was performed using originpro 2018 software packages originlab usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 the static adsorption assay iodine adsorption values of 21 kinds of activated carbon were shown in fig 2 a the iodine adsorption value ranged from 583 944 mg g and the average value was 817 mg g methylene blue adsorption values of 21 kinds of activated carbon were shown in fig 2b the values of methylene blue adsorption of 21 kinds of activated carbon ranged from 145 to 227 mg g and the average value was 177 mg g the iodine value is closely related to the ability of activated carbon to adsorb small molecules it can be used to estimate the specific surface area of the activated carbon and to relatively characterize the pore structure of the activated carbon as shown in fig 2c the order was briquetted carbon cylindrical broken carbon cylindrical carbon broken carbon the methylene blue value of liquid phase adsorption of activated carbon mainly reflects the decoloring ability of the activated carbon with a higher value indicating better adsorption performance methylene blue adsorption values of the four types of activated carbon were equivalent p 0 05 the order was briquetted carbon cylindrical broken carbon cylindrical carbon broken carbon as shown in fig 2d the adsorption performance index values of briquetted carbon were higher than those of the other three types of activated carbon reached or approached the national standard of superior activated carbon the results showed a large number of micropores mesopores and macropodids and a highly developed pore structure the iodine value of broken carbon was only 788 mg g which obviously could not reach the requirement of qualified products and its value of methylene blue 161 mg g was the lowest among the four types of activated carbon even though it slightly exceeded the qualified line it indicated that compared with the other three types of activated carbon the activation degree of broken carbon was lower and the pore structure was less developed 3 2 the dynamic adsorption assay the example of four activated carbon types from production companies b and c was shown in fig 3 during the 30 days continuous operation of the dynamic adsorption equipment similarly the uv254 and doc removal efficiencies of the different types of activated carbon columns were high at the beginning of the operation and then gradually decreased i e the values of ce c0 gradually increased ce represents the value of effluent uv254 and the concentration of effluent doc c0 represents the value of influent uv254 and the concentration of influent doc in particular cylindrical carbon and cylindrical broken carbon showed the most significant reduction in removal rates in contrast the removal of briquetted carbon was relatively excellent after 14 days of operation the values of ce c0 reached a relatively stable stage it showed that the stabilization values of ce c0 for briquetted carbon b1 1 b1 2 and c1 were all lower than those of the other three types of activated carbon uv254 and doc values of which are all below 0 5 and 0 9 respectively briquetted carbon had a shorter time to reach stabilization values approximately ten days which were an obvious advantage there were slight fluctuations in the uv254 and doc removal rates of all four types of activated carbon mainly due to fluctuations in the quality of the raw water during the assay period the average removal efficiency of uv254 for 21 kinds of activated carbon was 16 90 77 35 as shown in fig 4 a briquetted carbon b1 1 attained a higher uv254 removal efficiency 77 35 the dynamic adsorption assay was designed to compare the adsorption effect of different activated carbons on organic matter therefore an experimental bench plant was set up in parallel and operated continuously for 30 days without backwashing so the average removal efficiency of doc was very low the average removal rate of doc for different activated carbon ranged from 0 21 to 44 04 and the briquetted carbon b1 1 achieved higher doc removal efficiency 44 04 as shown in fig 4b there is a significant difference in the removal effect of doc on different activated carbons p 0 05 as shown in fig 4c and d the analysis was based on the average removal effect of the four types of activated carbon we selected for doc and uv254 there is an apparent difference in the average removal efficiency of uv254 and doc between the four types of activated carbon p 0 05 the order was briquetted carbon cylindrical broken carbon broken carbon cylindrical carbon the briquetted carbon had a significant advantage shown by the higher removal efficiency compared with the other three types of carbon p 0 05 at the same time the discrepancy between cylindrical broken carbon and broken carbon was minuscule p 0 05 3 3 hardness the hardness range of 21 kinds of activated carbon was 85 98 and the average value was 94 as shown in fig 5 a the hardness of different activated carbon was equivalent whose difference was slight p 0 05 as the damage of activated carbon during transportation backwashing and regeneration are considered in the practical application of activated carbon hardness and coefficient of friction are the primary control indicators in the selection of activated carbon and it is important to select activated carbon with the hardness and coefficient of friction as high as possible if the hardness is low the structure of the carbon is loosened and it will cause the carbon particles to fall off during backwashing which will lead to biosecurity issues in the water supply because of the ability of microorganisms to adhere to the surface of the carbon particles refer to gb and awwa standards hardness values of 90 four types of activated carbon were shown in fig 5 briquetted carbon with a hardness range from 90 to 96 and the average value was 93 cylindrical broken carbon with a hardness range of 91 97 with an average value of 94 broken carbon with a hardness range of 85 96 with an average value of 91 and cylindrical carbon with a hardness range of 92 98 with an average value of 96 there is little difference in the hardness of the four kinds of activated carbon and they all met the requirements for application very well p 0 05 3 4 comprehensive evaluation of activated carbon water purification performance 3 4 1 comprehensive evaluation model for the performance of activated carbon in water purification based on the static dynamic adsorption assay and the hardness characteristics of 21 kinds of activated carbon we used the ahp to confirm the weighting coefficient of each factor a comprehensive evaluation model of the water purification performance of activated carbon had been developed to select the most suitable type of activated carbon 1 i i w 1 j 1 2 a ij w 2 k 1 2 b ik w 3 c i i i a comprehensive score of

2 21 represents the hardness of activated carbon i 3 i 1 3 w i 1 i 1 2 3 the static adsorption performance includes iodine adsorption and methylene blue adsorption these two parameters may be related to the biomass of microorganisms attached to the activated carbon to some extent 29 the iodine adsorption and methylene blue adsorption values do not directly characterize the adsorption capacity of activated carbon for natural organics because the iodine and methylene blue values characterize the developed pores with diameters of 1 0 5 0 nm and 2 10 1 nm respectively 30 and the molecules of natural organics are larger than these pores therefore the adsorption of natural organics by activated carbon mainly occurs in transition pores with larger pore sizes 29 31 however it was found that activated carbon with a larger pore size of 3 10 nm was more effective against removing organic macromolecules and the biomass attached to activated carbon was closely related to the pore size less than 5 nm r 0 97 32 which may be related to the mechanism of biofilm metabolic substrates attached to activated carbon the substrates were first adsorbed on the pores on the outer surface of activated carbon 33 and it was partially degraded by the biofilm and then diffused into the micropores inside the activated carbon 34 although the bacteria attached to the activated carbon could not enter the micropores the extracellular enzymes secret by the activated carbon could easily diffuse into the micropores 35 under the action of external enzymes and micropores these substrates partially degraded by the biofilm are further degraded and modified 36 and then desorbed under the movement of the concentration gradient and diffused back to the biofilm to obtain further or complete degradation 37 38 therefore the weight value of activated carbon s static adsorption performance of iodine and methylene blue is relatively large with respect to the typical organic metrics doc and uv254 were chosen as our characterization parameters where doc reflects the total amount of soluble organic matter in water 39 and uv254 represents the content of humus macromolecular organic matter in water 40 and aromatic compounds containing cc double bonds and co double bonds in the dynamic adsorption assay the detection of doc and uv254 in the influent and effluent water of each activated carbon column provides an insight into the removal power of activated carbon for dissolved organic matter and hydrophobicity because the dynamic adsorption assay simulates the daily production of a water purification plant it is more convincing and its weight value accounts for the largest proportion in hardness characteristics analysis the activated carbon was rubbed and activated carbon with low strength was prone to cracking during the backwashing process the pollutants adsorbed by the activated carbon were released into the water resulting in water quality degradation therefore the hardness of the activated carbon i e the friction resistance of the activated carbon should also be given sufficient attention however since the hardness values of the 21 types of activated carbon in this study were not much different the weight value of the specific gravity is smaller than that of static adsorption and dynamic adsorption we have ranked the weights of the three index factors dynamic adsorption performance static adsorption performance hardness characteristics and through the analytic hierarchy process 41 44 the following table was obtained static adsorption performance dynamic adsorption performance hardness characteristics static adsorption performance 1 1 2 3 dynamic adsorption performance 2 1 3 hardness characteristics 1 3 1 3 1 the eigenvectors maximum eigenvalues ci values etc were analyzed and calculated the final weight distribution result was obtained as fig 6 shown 3 4 2 comprehensive evaluation results according to the granular activated carbon optimization model the total score of 21 kinds of activated carbon was calculated as showed in table 2 the total score range of 21 kinds of activated carbon was 0 159 1 561 and the average value was 0 654 briquette carbon b1 1 had the highest normalized score in this category because of its good dynamic adsorption performance which played an integral part in the model with a weighting of 53 in contrast the performance of cylindrical carbon f2 was particularly unsatisfactory as it ranked last in both static and dynamic adsorption performance even though it had the best hardness properties the average comprehensive score of the four types of activated carbon was shown in fig 7 the order was briquetted carbon cylindrical broken carbon broken carbon cylindrical carbon a visual comparison of the performance advantages and disadvantages of the four types of activated carbon we selected is shown in table 3 3 5 validation of the comprehensive evaluation model for activated carbon water purification performance based on the results of the comprehensive evaluation ranking the sample of activated carbon with the highest overall rating in each category b1 1 e3 c4 a2 which belong to briquetted carbon cylindrical broken carbon broken carbon and cylindrical carbon respective and the one at the bottom of the ranking of 21 activated carbons f2 which were selected for physical and chemical property analysis 3 5 1 pore size and surface area parameters the bet surface area and pore size distribution of five kinds of activated carbon numbered b1 1 e3 c4 a2 and f2 were tested and the results were shown in table 4 the average pore diameter of five kinds of activated carbon was between 1 8 2 3 nm as it ranked first in the total score the average pore diameter of b1 1 briquetted carbon was higher than other activated carbon data statistics showed that the average pore size of activated carbon was related to the total score p 0 01 the larger the average pore size the higher the comprehensive score ranking the bet surface area of the five activated carbon types was comparable with the largest surface area being a2 cylindrical carbon at 1104 m2 g and the smallest being f2 cylindrical carbon at 1007 m2 g the ranking order of the surface area was a2 cylindrical carbon c4 broken carbon e3 cylindrical broken carbon b1 1 briquetted carbon f2 cylindrical carbon the differences in total pore volume were noticeable the largest total pore volume was 0 581 m3 g for briquetted carbon b1 1 briquetted carbon and the smallest was 0 454 m3 g for f2 cylindrical carbon the order of total pore volume was b1 1 briquetted carbon e3 cylindrical broken carbon c4 broken carbon a2 cylindrical carbon f2 cylindrical carbon the five kinds of activated carbon mentioned above had well developed micropores but there is a wide variation among the activated carbon types b1 1 briquetted carbon had the largest micropore surface area of 804 m2 g and e3 cylindrical broken carbon had the smallest micropore volume of 510 m2 g b1 1 briquetted carbon had the largest micropore volume of 0 319 m3 g and e3 column broken carbon had the smallest micropore volume of 0 212 m3 g the largest mesopore specific surface area was a2 cylindrical carbon with 527 m2 g and the smallest was b1 1 briquetted carbon with 275 m2 g the largest mesopore volume was e3 cylindrical broken carbon with 0 212 m3 g and the smallest was f2 cylindrical carbon with 0 094 m3 g 3 5 2 the surface functional group of activated carbon the fourier transform infrared spectrometry was used to analyze the surface functional groups of activated carbon qualitatively as shown in fig 8 it demonstrated that the infrared spectra of a2 b1 1 c4 and e3 were similar with absorption peaks near 1600 cm 1 and 3250 3600 cm 1 the absorption peak at 1600 cm 1 might be caused by co of non conjugated ketones carboxyl groups or lactone groups the absorption peak near 3250 3600 cm 1 was dense and obvious the absorption peak near 3250 cm 1 might be caused by crystallization water the absorption peak at 3400 cm 1 mainly resulted from the stretching vibration of oh which might be a carboxyl group and phenolic hydroxyl group the absorption peak at 3640 cm 1 was primarily driven by structured water in addition to the absorption peak the f2 spectrum also had an absorption peak near 2000 cm 1 which arose from cc according to the boehn titration method 26 28 the content of surface functional groups in five activated carbon materials was shown in table 5 it indicated that the content of acidic oxygen containing functional groups in descending order was b1 1 briquetted carbon e3 cylindrical broken carbon c4 broken carbon a2 cylindrical carbon f2 cylindrical carbon the content of acidic oxygen containing functional groups of activated carbon correlated with the total score the contents of the carboxyl group lactone group and phenolic hydroxyl group between different activated carbons were quite different the carboxyl group content was sorted as c4 broken charcoal e3 cylindrical broken carbon b1 1 briquetted carbon a2 cylindrical carbon f2 cylindrical carbon and the lactone group content was in the order of c4 broken carbon e3 cylindrical broken carbon f2 cylindrical carbon b1 1 briquetted carbon a2 cylindrical carbon the phenolic hydroxyl group content in descending order was b1 1 briquetted carbon a2 cylindrical carbon e3 cylindrical broken carbon f2 cylindrical carbon c4 broken carbon in summary according to the analysis of the physical and chemical properties of activated carbon there is no obvious difference in the specific surface area and the types of surface functional groups among the five types of activated carbon the overall score of activated carbon based on the evaluation model

13639,severe organic pollution in surface water worldwide has put forward higher requirements for new water treatment technologies due to the characteristics of large specific surface areas and strong adsorption of organic matters granular activated carbon has been widely used in water treatment currently little research has been carried out on comprehensive evaluation models for the adsorption and hardness of activated carbon coursing in a lack of a scientific and comprehensive selection process twenty one kinds of activated carbon briquetted carbon cylindrical carbon cylindrical broken carbon and broken carbon produced by seven companies were selected in this study a comprehensive evaluation model of activated carbon water purification performance was developed this study not only contained static and dynamic adsorption tests but also included hardness characteristic analysis and the analytic hierarchy process ahp was used to determine the weight of each factor the results indicated that briquetted carbon performed best in terms of comprehensive performance of activated carbon to be followed by cylindrical carbon cylindrical broken carbon and broken carbon consecutively owing to the highest total pore volume 0 581 m3 g 1 and the highest content of oxygen containing functional groups the best performance of briquetted carbon was corroborated by the analysis of physicochemical properties and the model was reasonable the research provides a theoretical basis that has important implications for the optimization selection of activated carbon keywords activated carbon optimization advanced water treatment process static adsorption dynamic adsorption 1 introduction more and more surface water sources have been polluted by industrial livestock and agricultural wastewater discharge increases in organic inorganic and microbial contamination in source water bring in concern of water quality 1 including color taste odor biological instability as well as disinfection byproducts dbps 2 7 thus drinking water safety has become a priority for environmental communities worldwide the water treatment process plays an essential role in reducing serious illnesses associated with waterborne diseases although traditional water treatment processes are excellent for the removal of some contaminants such as suspended solids colloidal substances and bacteria from water they are still unable to satisfy the requirements of progressively higher drinking water quality standards especially with regard to the removal of organic and emerging contaminants 8 10 due to the high specific surface area and hydrophobic interactions as compared to conventional materials activated carbon shows high potential for controlling heavy metals organic pollutants and microorganism removal in drinking water 11 13 and effectively improve water quality 14 the ozone activated carbon has been widely used in water purification processes 15 the granular activated carbon gac has been listed as the most effective technique to deal with 51 organic pollutants in the united states environmental protection agency usepa drinking water standard 16 the selection of granular activated carbon and its operation and maintenance has become the research hotspots in the ozone activated carbon process 17 the basis of its selection and parameter optimization is crucial at present most researchers consider the evaluation of a single type of activated carbon mainly based on the physical properties specific surface area pore volume particle size and strength ash content water content loading density etc and the indicators of adsorption capacity iodine value methylene blue 18 19 carbon tetrachloride adsorption capacity etc 20 21 however there are many different types of activated carbon the evaluation methods of the characteristics and removal performance of activated carbon have not been comprehensively investigated leading to the lack of scientific and overall selection of carbon species based on static and dynamic adsorption assays combined with the hardness characteristics analyses we conducted a bench experiment to select excellent activated carbon in this paper it developed a comprehensive evaluation method of the performance of activated carbon for water purification 2 experimental methods and materials 2 1 experimental materials twenty one kinds of activated carbon including briquetted carbon cylindrical carbon cylindrical broken carbon and broken carbon produced by seven companies were selected as shown in table 1 they were numbered in accordance with the manufacturers and their categories to carry out a test of blind selection the corresponding manufacturing information was shown in table s1 2 2 the static adsorption assay static adsorption includes iodine adsorption value and methylene blue adsorption value the iodine adsorption value was determined following the test method for granular activated carbon from coal determination of iodine adsorption gb t 7702 7 2008 22 and the determination of the methylene blue adsorption value was determined following test method for granular activated carbon from coal determination of methylene blue adsorption gb t 7702 6 2008 23 24 2 3 the dynamic adsorption assay the device for the activated carbon dynamic adsorption consisted of a regulating water tank a peristaltic pump river yz15 and an activated carbon column as shown in fig 1 the activated carbon column has an inner diameter of 15 mm and a length of 600 mm from bottom to top 10 20 mm gravel particle size 6 8 mm and 300 mm optional granular activated carbon were sequentially packed stone and optional granular activated carbon were washed with distilled water before filling the wet packing method was specified for filling the tap water was used as feedwater and sodium thiosulfate was added to the tap water 1 2 1 to neutralize the remaining chlorine in this paper the water flowed past the activated carbon column from top to bottom as shown in fig 1 the flow rate was 9 m h water quality parameters including turbidity uv254 and doc were tested from the inlet and outlet water 2 4 the hardness assay the hardness of activated carbon was carried out according to the test method for granular activated carbon from coal determination of hardness gb t 7702 3 2008 25 the activated carbon sample was put into a unique instrument equipped with a certain number of stainless steel balls rotated and regularly beat the sample s mass retained on the assay sieve after the assay accounts for the percentage of the sample s total mass as the hardness of the activated carbon 2 5 detection of pore size and surface area of activated carbon activated carbon pore size and surface area parameters were detected by the constant temperature gas adsorption method according to bet brunauer emmett teller and t plot curves the specific surface area micropore specific surface area and pore volume of activated carbon were obtained the specific surface area and pore analysis of activated carbon adopt micromeritics with the model asap 2020 v4 03 2 6 infrared spectroscopy detection of functional groups on the activated carbon surface a fourier transform infrared spectrometry analyzer nicolet 5700 thermo scientific was used for the qualitative detection of functional group types on the surface of activated carbon the scanning range was 400 4000 cm 1 and the resolution was 1 cm 1 2 7 boehm titration of functional group content on the activated carbon surface the most important functional groups on the surface of activated carbon include carboxyl lactone carbonyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups which are acidic in water and can be quantified by alkaline liquid titration with different intensities according to the boehm titration method 26 28 nahco3 can neutralize carboxyl groups na2co3 can neutralize carboxyl and lactone groups and naoh can neutralize carboxyl lactone and phenolic hydroxyl groups so the content of carboxyl lactone and phenolic hydroxyl groups can be calculated by titration with nahco3 na2co3 and naoh solutions respectively the operation of the boehm titration method in this study was modified based on the previous assay 2 8 the analytic hierarchy process ahp ahp is a systematic and hierarchical analysis method that combines qualitative and quantitative approaches it is a systematic and hierarchical approach to analyse a system that consists of many factors that are inter related and inter constrained and lack of quantitative data the ahp analysis we used which was divided into four steps 1 establishing a recursive hierarchy 2 constructing a judgment matrix in each level 3 single ranking and consistency check and 4 total ranking and consistency check in this study the decision objective of the hierarchy is the optimal activated carbon selection scheme g we determined that the criterion layer a contains static adsorption index a1 dynamic adsorption index a2 and hardness index a3 the judgment matrix constructed by comparing the strong and weak relationships between factors on the influence of the decision problem and the consistency of the test results of the matrix judged by the consistency ratio cr and the consistency quantification index ci 2 9 other analytical measurements a total organic carbon analyzer toc lcph was used to measure the doc of water samples a uv vis spectrophotometer thermo evolution 201 was used to measure the uv254 ibm spss statistics 25 conducted with microsoft excel software package microsoft corporation usa was used to compare the statistical difference between two sets of data linear regression was performed using originpro 2018 software packages originlab usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 the static adsorption assay iodine adsorption values of 21 kinds of activated carbon were shown in fig 2 a the iodine adsorption value ranged from 583 944 mg g and the average value was 817 mg g methylene blue adsorption values of 21 kinds of activated carbon were shown in fig 2b the values of methylene blue adsorption of 21 kinds of activated carbon ranged from 145 to 227 mg g and the average value was 177 mg g the iodine value is closely related to the ability of activated carbon to adsorb small molecules it can be used to estimate the specific surface area of the activated carbon and to relatively characterize the pore structure of the activated carbon as shown in fig 2c the order was briquetted carbon cylindrical broken carbon cylindrical carbon broken carbon the methylene blue value of liquid phase adsorption of activated carbon mainly reflects the decoloring ability of the activated carbon with a higher value indicating better adsorption performance methylene blue adsorption values of the four types of activated carbon were equivalent p 0 05 the order was briquetted carbon cylindrical broken carbon cylindrical carbon broken carbon as shown in fig 2d the adsorption performance index values of briquetted carbon were higher than those of the other three types of activated carbon reached or approached the national standard of superior activated carbon the results showed a large number of micropores mesopores and macropodids and a highly developed pore structure the iodine value of broken carbon was only 788 mg g which obviously could not reach the requirement of qualified products and its value of methylene blue 161 mg g was the lowest among the four types of activated carbon even though it slightly exceeded the qualified line it indicated that compared with the other three types of activated carbon the activation degree of broken carbon was lower and the pore structure was less developed 3 2 the dynamic adsorption assay the example of four activated carbon types from production companies b and c was shown in fig 3 during the 30 days continuous operation of the dynamic adsorption equipment similarly the uv254 and doc removal efficiencies of the different types of activated carbon columns were high at the beginning of the operation and then gradually decreased i e the values of ce c0 gradually increased ce represents the value of effluent uv254 and the concentration of effluent doc c0 represents the value of influent uv254 and the concentration of influent doc in particular cylindrical carbon and cylindrical broken carbon showed the most significant reduction in removal rates in contrast the removal of briquetted carbon was relatively excellent after 14 days of operation the values of ce c0 reached a relatively stable stage it showed that the stabilization values of ce c0 for briquetted carbon b1 1 b1 2 and c1 were all lower than those of the other three types of activated carbon uv254 and doc values of which are all below 0 5 and 0 9 respectively briquetted carbon had a shorter time to reach stabilization values approximately ten days which were an obvious advantage there were slight fluctuations in the uv254 and doc removal rates of all four types of activated carbon mainly due to fluctuations in the quality of the raw water during the assay period the average removal efficiency of uv254 for 21 kinds of activated carbon was 16 90 77 35 as shown in fig 4 a briquetted carbon b1 1 attained a higher uv254 removal efficiency 77 35 the dynamic adsorption assay was designed to compare the adsorption effect of different activated carbons on organic matter therefore an experimental bench plant was set up in parallel and operated continuously for 30 days without backwashing so the average removal efficiency of doc was very low the average removal rate of doc for different activated carbon ranged from 0 21 to 44 04 and the briquetted carbon b1 1 achieved higher doc removal efficiency 44 04 as shown in fig 4b there is a significant difference in the removal effect of doc on different activated carbons p 0 05 as shown in fig 4c and d the analysis was based on the average removal effect of the four types of activated carbon we selected for doc and uv254 there is an apparent difference in the average removal efficiency of uv254 and doc between the four types of activated carbon p 0 05 the order was briquetted carbon cylindrical broken carbon broken carbon cylindrical carbon the briquetted carbon had a significant advantage shown by the higher removal efficiency compared with the other three types of carbon p 0 05 at the same time the discrepancy between cylindrical broken carbon and broken carbon was minuscule p 0 05 3 3 hardness the hardness range of 21 kinds of activated carbon was 85 98 and the average value was 94 as shown in fig 5 a the hardness of different activated carbon was equivalent whose difference was slight p 0 05 as the damage of activated carbon during transportation backwashing and regeneration are considered in the practical application of activated carbon hardness and coefficient of friction are the primary control indicators in the selection of activated carbon and it is important to select activated carbon with the hardness and coefficient of friction as high as possible if the hardness is low the structure of the carbon is loosened and it will cause the carbon particles to fall off during backwashing which will lead to biosecurity issues in the water supply because of the ability of microorganisms to adhere to the surface of the carbon particles refer to gb and awwa standards hardness values of 90 four types of activated carbon were shown in fig 5 briquetted carbon with a hardness range from 90 to 96 and the average value was 93 cylindrical broken carbon with a hardness range of 91 97 with an average value of 94 broken carbon with a hardness range of 85 96 with an average value of 91 and cylindrical carbon with a hardness range of 92 98 with an average value of 96 there is little difference in the hardness of the four kinds of activated carbon and they all met the requirements for application very well p 0 05 3 4 comprehensive evaluation of activated carbon water purification performance 3 4 1 comprehensive evaluation model for the performance of activated carbon in water purification based on the static dynamic adsorption assay and the hardness characteristics of 21 kinds of activated carbon we used the ahp to confirm the weighting coefficient of each factor a comprehensive evaluation model of the water purification performance of activated carbon had been developed to select the most suitable type of activated carbon 1 i i w 1 j 1 2 a ij w 2 k 1 2 b ik w 3 c i i i a comprehensive score of

2 21 represents the hardness of activated carbon i 3 i 1 3 w i 1 i 1 2 3 the static adsorption performance includes iodine adsorption and methylene blue adsorption these two parameters may be related to the biomass of microorganisms attached to the activated carbon to some extent 29 the iodine adsorption and methylene blue adsorption values do not directly characterize the adsorption capacity of activated carbon for natural organics because the iodine and methylene blue values characterize the developed pores with diameters of 1 0 5 0 nm and 2 10 1 nm respectively 30 and the molecules of natural organics are larger than these pores therefore the adsorption of natural organics by activated carbon mainly occurs in transition pores with larger pore sizes 29 31 however it was found that activated carbon with a larger pore size of 3 10 nm was more effective against removing organic macromolecules and the biomass attached to activated carbon was closely related to the pore size less than 5 nm r 0 97 32 which may be related to the mechanism of biofilm metabolic substrates attached to activated carbon the substrates were first adsorbed on the pores on the outer surface of activated carbon 33 and it was partially degraded by the biofilm and then diffused into the micropores inside the activated carbon 34 although the bacteria attached to the activated carbon could not enter the micropores the extracellular enzymes secret by the activated carbon could easily diffuse into the micropores 35 under the action of external enzymes and micropores these substrates partially degraded by the biofilm are further degraded and modified 36 and then desorbed under the movement of the concentration gradient and diffused back to the biofilm to obtain further or complete degradation 37 38 therefore the weight value of activated carbon s static adsorption performance of iodine and methylene blue is relatively large with respect to the typical organic metrics doc and uv254 were chosen as our characterization parameters where doc reflects the total amount of soluble organic matter in water 39 and uv254 represents the content of humus macromolecular organic matter in water 40 and aromatic compounds containing cc double bonds and co double bonds in the dynamic adsorption assay the detection of doc and uv254 in the influent and effluent water of each activated carbon column provides an insight into the removal power of activated carbon for dissolved organic matter and hydrophobicity because the dynamic adsorption assay simulates the daily production of a water purification plant it is more convincing and its weight value accounts for the largest proportion in hardness characteristics analysis the activated carbon was rubbed and activated carbon with low strength was prone to cracking during the backwashing process the pollutants adsorbed by the activated carbon were released into the water resulting in water quality degradation therefore the hardness of the activated carbon i e the friction resistance of the activated carbon should also be given sufficient attention however since the hardness values of the 21 types of activated carbon in this study were not much different the weight value of the specific gravity is smaller than that of static adsorption and dynamic adsorption we have ranked the weights of the three index factors dynamic adsorption performance static adsorption performance hardness characteristics and through the analytic hierarchy process 41 44 the following table was obtained static adsorption performance dynamic adsorption performance hardness characteristics static adsorption performance 1 1 2 3 dynamic adsorption performance 2 1 3 hardness characteristics 1 3 1 3 1 the eigenvectors maximum eigenvalues ci values etc were analyzed and calculated the final weight distribution result was obtained as fig 6 shown 3 4 2 comprehensive evaluation results according to the granular activated carbon optimization model the total score of 21 kinds of activated carbon was calculated as showed in table 2 the total score range of 21 kinds of activated carbon was 0 159 1 561 and the average value was 0 654 briquette carbon b1 1 had the highest normalized score in this category because of its good dynamic adsorption performance which played an integral part in the model with a weighting of 53 in contrast the performance of cylindrical carbon f2 was particularly unsatisfactory as it ranked last in both static and dynamic adsorption performance even though it had the best hardness properties the average comprehensive score of the four types of activated carbon was shown in fig 7 the order was briquetted carbon cylindrical broken carbon broken carbon cylindrical carbon a visual comparison of the performance advantages and disadvantages of the four types of activated carbon we selected is shown in table 3 3 5 validation of the comprehensive evaluation model for activated carbon water purification performance based on the results of the comprehensive evaluation ranking the sample of activated carbon with the highest overall rating in each category b1 1 e3 c4 a2 which belong to briquetted carbon cylindrical broken carbon broken carbon and cylindrical carbon respective and the one at the bottom of the ranking of 21 activated carbons f2 which were selected for physical and chemical property analysis 3 5 1 pore size and surface area parameters the bet surface area and pore size distribution of five kinds of activated carbon numbered b1 1 e3 c4 a2 and f2 were tested and the results were shown in table 4 the average pore diameter of five kinds of activated carbon was between 1 8 2 3 nm as it ranked first in the total score the average pore diameter of b1 1 briquetted carbon was higher than other activated carbon data statistics showed that the average pore size of activated carbon was related to the total score p 0 01 the larger the average pore size the higher the comprehensive score ranking the bet surface area of the five activated carbon types was comparable with the largest surface area being a2 cylindrical carbon at 1104 m2 g and the smallest being f2 cylindrical carbon at 1007 m2 g the ranking order of the surface area was a2 cylindrical carbon c4 broken carbon e3 cylindrical broken carbon b1 1 briquetted carbon f2 cylindrical carbon the differences in total pore volume were noticeable the largest total pore volume was 0 581 m3 g for briquetted carbon b1 1 briquetted carbon and the smallest was 0 454 m3 g for f2 cylindrical carbon the order of total pore volume was b1 1 briquetted carbon e3 cylindrical broken carbon c4 broken carbon a2 cylindrical carbon f2 cylindrical carbon the five kinds of activated carbon mentioned above had well developed micropores but there is a wide variation among the activated carbon types b1 1 briquetted carbon had the largest micropore surface area of 804 m2 g and e3 cylindrical broken carbon had the smallest micropore volume of 510 m2 g b1 1 briquetted carbon had the largest micropore volume of 0 319 m3 g and e3 column broken carbon had the smallest micropore volume of 0 212 m3 g the largest mesopore specific surface area was a2 cylindrical carbon with 527 m2 g and the smallest was b1 1 briquetted carbon with 275 m2 g the largest mesopore volume was e3 cylindrical broken carbon with 0 212 m3 g and the smallest was f2 cylindrical carbon with 0 094 m3 g 3 5 2 the surface functional group of activated carbon the fourier transform infrared spectrometry was used to analyze the surface functional groups of activated carbon qualitatively as shown in fig 8 it demonstrated that the infrared spectra of a2 b1 1 c4 and e3 were similar with absorption peaks near 1600 cm 1 and 3250 3600 cm 1 the absorption peak at 1600 cm 1 might be caused by co of non conjugated ketones carboxyl groups or lactone groups the absorption peak near 3250 3600 cm 1 was dense and obvious the absorption peak near 3250 cm 1 might be caused by crystallization water the absorption peak at 3400 cm 1 mainly resulted from the stretching vibration of oh which might be a carboxyl group and phenolic hydroxyl group the absorption peak at 3640 cm 1 was primarily driven by structured water in addition to the absorption peak the f2 spectrum also had an absorption peak near 2000 cm 1 which arose from cc according to the boehn titration method 26 28 the content of surface functional groups in five activated carbon materials was shown in table 5 it indicated that the content of acidic oxygen containing functional groups in descending order was b1 1 briquetted carbon e3 cylindrical broken carbon c4 broken carbon a2 cylindrical carbon f2 cylindrical carbon the content of acidic oxygen containing functional groups of activated carbon correlated with the total score the contents of the carboxyl group lactone group and phenolic hydroxyl group between different activated carbons were quite different the carboxyl group content was sorted as c4 broken charcoal e3 cylindrical broken carbon b1 1 briquetted carbon a2 cylindrical carbon f2 cylindrical carbon and the lactone group content was in the order of c4 broken carbon e3 cylindrical broken carbon f2 cylindrical carbon b1 1 briquetted carbon a2 cylindrical carbon the phenolic hydroxyl group content in descending order was b1 1 briquetted carbon a2 cylindrical carbon e3 cylindrical broken carbon f2 cylindrical carbon c4 broken carbon in summary according to the analysis of the physical and chemical properties of activated carbon there is no obvious difference in the specific surface area and the types of surface functional groups among the five types of activated carbon the overall score of activated carbon based on the evaluation model
