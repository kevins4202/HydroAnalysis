6730,floodplains may alternate between discharge zones for regional groundwater and areas of recharge from river water during high flow events understanding the mechanisms and timescales of recharge on floodplains is important for their management and for the protection of fragile ecosystems the floodplains of the river murray host important ecosystems particularly remnant eucalypt forests that are vulnerable to changes in inundation rising regional water tables and salt accumulation this study addresses floodplain recharge and groundwater mixing on the pike and katarapko floodplains of south australia at pike 3h activities of groundwater in the low hydraulic conductivity coonambidgal formation that crops out on the floodplain are 0 25 tu 3h activities of groundwater in the underlying higher hydraulic conductivity monoman formation decrease from 1 tu near the contact with the coonambidgal formation to 0 02 tu at 15 m depth groundwater 14c activities are between 40 and 95 pmc but are less well correlated with depth the 3h or 14c activities do not vary systematically with distance from the surface water channels on the floodplains these observations imply that groundwater recharge at pike is dominantly through the floodplain rather than through the channel banks in contrast to the regional groundwater where total dissolved solids tds concentrations are commonly 35 000 mg l the tds of groundwater on the floodplain is locally 500 mg l a correlation between 3h activities and tds and the presence of groundwater with relatively low 14c activities but above detection 3h activities implies that recently recharged waters have mixed with regional groundwater in the floodplain sediments the 3h activities in these mixed waters implies that mixing occurs over a few years by contrast at katarapko the highest 3h activities in the monoman formation groundwater up to 2 35 tu are closer to the murray river implying that recharge through the bank may occur these contrasting patterns of recharge probably reflect local topographic controls understanding the recharge discharge relationships are vital for managing proposed floodplain inundation programs aimed at improving ecosystem health keywords groundwater geochemistry recharge residence times riverine environments floodplain ecosystems 1 introduction floodplains are dynamic zones of groundwater surface water interaction that commonly sustain distinct and fragile ecosystems ward et al 1999 kingsford 2000 woessner 2000 holland et al 2006 2009 jolly et al 2008 as such they have high intrinsic values and are commonly the focus of preservation or rehabilitation efforts e g murray darling basin authority 2017 globally streamflows of many arid and semi arid rivers have been substantially modified due to the diversion of water for agriculture industry or domestic use puckridge et al 2000 northcott et al 2007 ellis et al 2017 stone et al 2017 additionally to protect infrastructure developed on floodplains the magnitude and frequency of floods is commonly reduced by regulating flows these modifications may have major impacts on floodplain hydrogeology and ecology floodplains represent the interface between regional groundwater systems and rivers and may be groundwater discharge or recharge zones e g lamontagne et al 2005 cartwright et al 2010 2011 cend√≥n et al 2010 in some cases groundwater discharge and recharge occur in alternating river reaches telfer et al 2005 bekesi et al 2014 or in the same locations at different river stages jolly et al 1994 where the regional groundwater is saline lenses of relatively young lower salinity groundwater also commonly referred to as freshwater lenses laattoe et al 2017 may form by recharge of the floodplain aquifers by river water lamontagne et al 2005 holland et al 2009 cartwright et al 2010 werner and laattoe 2016 laattoe et al 2017 these lower salinity lenses are locally important in sustaining riverine ecosystems such as forests on the floodplain in rivers that alternate between gaining and losing the lower salinity lenses also form a buffer against saline regional groundwater discharging into the river at low streamflows cartwright et al 2011 telfer et al 2012 documenting the patterns and timescales of groundwater recharge and mixing on floodplains is critical to the management of lower salinity lenses in particular it is important to document whether recharge through the floodplains rather than flow through riverbanks is required to recharge the groundwater in the lower salinity lens where the lenses are formed by recharge through the floodplain periodic floodplain inundation is required to maintain the low salinity groundwater by contrast if the lenses are replenished via recharge through the riverbanks they may be maintained by high river stages without floodplain inundation 1 1 estimating timescales of recharge and mixing tritium 3h with a half life of 12 32 years is commonly used to estimate groundwater residence times and recharge rates where these are less than 100 years cartwright and morgenstern 2012 morgenstern and daughney 2012 clark 2015 cartwright et al 2017a 3h is part of the water molecule and thus geochemical or biogeochemical reactions in the soils or aquifers do not affect its abundance rainfall 3h activities peaked in the 1950s 1960s due to the production of 3h in atmospheric thermonuclear tests the bomb pulse e g tadros et al 2014 clark 2015 due to the distribution of the atmospheric nuclear tests bomb pulse 3h activities in the southern hemisphere were much lower than in the northern hemisphere and the remnant bomb pulse 3h has now largely decayed below the activities of modern rainfall this situation permits residence times to be more readily calculated from 3h activities morgenstern et al 2010 radioisotopes are also valuable in understanding mixing within aquifer systems because 14c and 3h have significantly different half lives 12 32 and 5730 years respectively much of the 3h in groundwater will have decayed before substantial 14c decay occurs this results in groundwater from flow systems that do not exhibit mixing having low to moderate 14c activities and below detection 3h activities by contrast mixing of young groundwater with high 14c and 3h activities with older groundwater that is 3h free and has lower 14c activities results in groundwater with low to moderate 14c activities but above background 3h le gal la salle et al 2001 cartwright et al 2007 2010 2013 2017a the use of 3h and 14c to detect groundwater mixing is relatively unaffected by the assumed geometries of the flow system cartwright et al 2013 2017a however other processes that reduce groundwater 14c activities e g calcite dissolution and methanogenesis complicate the quantification of mixing 1 2 river murray floodplains the murray darling river system drains 106 km2 of eastern australia and is australia s largest river system hart 2015 the lower reaches of the darling river and the entirety of the river murray are contained within the murray basin the total dissolved solids tds concentrations of murray basin groundwater varies widely with tds concentrations up to 200 000 mg l and commonly 35 000 mg l in much of the central basin herczeg et al 2001 cartwright et al 2008 2017b lower salinity lenses containing groundwater with tds concentrations of 10 000 mg l are locally developed along the murray and darling rivers and their tributaries lamontagne et al 2005 cartwright et al 2010 werner and laattoe 2016 laattoe et al 2017 in the downstream reaches of the river murray groundwater from these lower salinity lenses is vital for sustaining the riverine ecosystems notably the remnant eucalyptus forests of river red gum black box and ironbark jolly et al 1994 kingsford 2000 lamontagne et al 2005 holland et al 2006 2009 doody et al 2009 large scale irrigation using river murray water began in the 1880s and the flows of the river murray have been highly regulated since the 1920s e g hart 2015 murray darling basin authority 2017 some 42 of the murray darling basin river water is currently diverted largely for agriculture and flow is further moderated by a series of storages hart 2015 murray darling basin authority 2017 whereas under natural conditions the floodplains would have been inundated every few years inundation now occurs far less frequently and is less extensive montazeri and mccullough 2015a b additionally land clearing and irrigation on the higher land adjacent to the rivers has resulted in additional recharge that has caused the regional water table to rise this has led to the development of saline discharge areas on the floodplain degradation of the lower salinity lenses increased discharge of saline water to the river murray and salinization of floodplain wetlands and soils these changes to the hydrogeology have damaged floodplain ecosystems in recent years there have been efforts to redress these changes by increasing river levels through a suite of management actions commonly termed environmental watering kingsford 2000 holland et al 2009 environmental watering includes floodplain inundation that replenishes surface water bodies promote seedling recruitment and increases soil moisture it also induces recharge on the floodplain and lowers the salinity of the shallow groundwater underlying the floodplain between 2013 and 2016 there were over 750 inundation events in the lower and middle reaches of the river murray murray darling basin authority 2017 however assessing the likely efficacy of these measures requires that the floodplain hydrogeology at the individual sites is well understood previous studies of groundwater geochemistry radioactive isotopes groundwater elevations and the stable isotope ratios and moisture contents of soils and trees have concluded locally that the groundwater of the river murray floodplains in victoria and south australia are recharged both through inundation and via the riverbanks jolly et al 1994 bramley et al 2003 holland et al 2006 2009 lamontagne et al 2005 cartwright et al 2010 if recharge of the floodplains occurs dominantly via the banks of the main river or its anabranches the inundation events may require lower volumes of water to protect or re establish lower salinity lenses compared with sites where floodplain recharge occurs in addition inundation may raise the water table adjacent to the inundated area and adversely affect adjacent lower salinity lenses purczel et al 2016 1 3 objectives the aim of this study is to understand groundwater recharge on two contrasting saline floodplains of the river murray in south australia where major engineering works are under construction to allow inundation firstly we aim to determine whether active recharge currently occurs on these floodplains or whether the low salinity groundwater is a relic of previous hydrogeological regimes further we address whether recharge occurred through the floodplain or via the banks of the anabranches finally we examines the timescales of mixing of saline regional groundwater with water recharged on the floodplains resolution of these objectives informs the management of the river murray floodplains in particular the inundation program while the study is based on specific sites the results have implications for understanding and managing floodplain processes in other semi arid areas 1 4 study area this study is based on the pike and katarapko floodplains of the river murray near renmark south australia fig 1 the area is semi arid with a mean annual rainfall of 260 mm that dominantly falls within the austral winter and an annual potential evapotranspiration rate of 1100 mm bureau of meteorology 2017 the floodplains retain remnant native vegetation with river red gums close to the river murray and black box and ironbark forests elsewhere on the floodplain jolly et al 1994 harrington et al 2005 holland et al 2006 2009 doody et al 2009 most of the upland areas away from the river have been cleared for agriculture including irrigated and dryland wheat horticulture including citrus vegetables grapes and nuts and grazing the geology and hydrogeology of this part of the murray basin is described by harrington et al 2005 holland et al 2006 doody et al 2009 and purczel et al 2016 fig 2 the upland areas away from the river murray comprise the miocene to pliocene loxton sands which is a partially confined regional aquifer consisting of medium to coarse grained sands with local finer grained layers the loxton sands is locally overlain by the early pleistocene blanchetown clay which forms a regional aquitard and the unconsolidated sands silts and clays of the holocene woorinen formation the clay rich low hydraulic conductivity lower loxton clay and bookpurnong formation restrict flow between the loxton sands and deeper units such as the limestones of the murray group the river murray floodplains contain sediments belonging to the pleistocene to holocene monoman and coonambidgal formations fig 2 the monoman formation comprises fine to coarse grained fluviatile sands with minor clay and silt layers this formation is typically 10 20 m thick harrington et al 2005 and generally overlies the lower parts of the loxton sands or the lower loxton clay and bookpurnong formation aquitard the coonambidgal formation is the shallowest floodplain unit and consists of up to 10 m of low hydraulic conductivity silts and clays deposited by flood events purczel et al 2016 the coonambidgal formation may be locally absent or overlain by dune sands the main channel of the river murray and some of its anabranches are incised through the coonambidgal formation into the monoman formation while other anabranches lie entirely within the coonambidgal formation in common with much of the central murray basin herczeg et al 2001 cartwright et al 2008 2017b harrington et al 2005 groundwater in the loxton sands commonly has tds concentrations of 30 000 mg l locally up to 100 000 mg l the tds of groundwater from the monoman formation on the floodplain varies from 500 mg l to 90 000 mg l harrington et al 2005 purczel et al 2016 some of the low salinity groundwater is associated with recharge from the river murray where the river level has been artificially raised behind storages locally referred to as locks groundwater heads in the shallow aquifers at pike decrease towards the river murray and the heads in the deeper aquifers below the bookpurnong formation are higher than those in the shallower units harrington et al 2005 purczel et al 2016 consequently the pike floodplain is a discharge area and groundwater discharge sites marked by saline water and gypsum deposits occur on the floodplain upward head gradients and in river nano tem surveys indicate that the murray river and the anabranches in the pike area are predominantly gaining purczel et al 2016 the water table at katarapko is deeper than at pike while local groundwater discharge sites occur at katarapko the deeper groundwater and distribution of heads suggests the river murray in this area may be locally losing at both sites inundation of the floodplain probably reverses upward head gradients allowing recharge through the floodplain to occur the difference in recharge discharge behaviour between the two sites is reflected in the groundwater salinity and ecosystem health katarapko has more extensive regions of lower salinity groundwater than pike fig 1 vegetation surveys show that healthy trees exist at both sites but that there is a higher prevalence of dead trees at pike michelle denny dew pers comm 8 may 2018 both katarapko and pike floodplains have been targeted for improved environmental management by the south australian riverland floodplain integrated infrastructure program sarfiip purczel et al 2016 this involves engineering works including the construction of regulators on anabranches and blocking banks which enable extensive flooding of the floodplains or contain floodwaters to specific floodplain areas 2 sampling and analytical techniques 2 1 sampling groundwater was sampled from monitoring bores in the coonambidgal and monoman formations distributed throughout the pike and katarapko floodplains fig 1 table s1 using an impeller pump set in the screened interval sampling commenced once field parameters had stabilised at pike the shallow monoman samples are from 1 to 2 m below the contact with the coonambidgal formation while the deeper monoman samples are several metres below the contact surface water samples at pike were collected from pools in anabranches on the floodplain that were not flowing at the time of sampling 2 2 analytical techniques geochemical data is presented in the supplement table s1 electrical conductivity ec was measured with a calibrated tps meter and probe hco3 concentrations were determined using a hach digital titrator and reagents with a precision of 5 major ion concentrations and stable isotope ratios were analysed at monash university anion concentrations were determined using a thermo fisher ion chromatograph on filtered unacidified samples cation concentrations were determined using a thermo fisher icp oes on samples that had been filtered through 0 45 ¬µm cellulose nitrate filters and acidified to ph 2 using double distilled 16 m hno3 the precision of anion and cation analyses based on replicate analyses is 2 and the accuracy based on analysis of certified water standards is 5 charge balance errors range from 5 6 to 5 4 median 1 8 tds concentrations are the sum of the dissolved major ions stable isotope ratios were determined using a thermo finnigan deltaplus mass spectrometer Œ¥18o analysis was by equilibration of h2o with he co2 at 32 c for 24 48 h in a thermo finnigan gas bench Œ¥2h analysis utilised reduction of h2o with cr at 850 c in an automated finnigan mat h device co2 from dissolved inorganic carbon dic was liberated by acidification using h3po4 in a he atmosphere in a thermo finnigan gas bench stable isotope ratios were normalised using a range of international and internal standards following coplen 1988 and are expressed in per mil notation relative to v smow Œ¥18o Œ¥2h or v pdb Œ¥13c precision œÉ based on replicate analysis is 0 15 for Œ¥18o 0 2 for Œ¥13c and 1 for Œ¥18h 14c activities were measured by accelerator mass spectrometer at gns new zealand using methods summarised by stewart et al 2016 dic was converted to co2 through acidification using orthophosphoric acid in sealed glass vessels the co2 was collected and purified cryogenically under vacuum and converted to graphite which formed the target for the accelerator mass spectrometer measurement 14c activities are expressed as percent modern carbon pmc where the 14c activity of modern carbon is 95 of the 14c activity of the nbs oxalic acid standard in 1950 uncertainties range from 0 07 at close to 0 pmc to 0 8 pmc at 100 pmc 3h activities were determined at gns new zealand using liquid scintillation in quantulus ultra low level counters on samples that had been vacuum distilled and electrolytically enriched morgenstern and taylor 2009 3h activities are expressed in tritium units tu where 1 tu represents a 3h 1h ratio of 1 10 18 tritium enrichment is by a factor of 95 which yields a detection limit of 0 02 tu and the relative precision 1œÉ at a 3h activity of 1 tu is 2 table s1 2 3 mean residence times the relatively small dataset and the possibility that mixing has occurred precludes a detailed analysis of groundwater residence times approximate mean residence times were estimated from the 3h activities using lumped parameter models maloszewski 2000 as implemented in the tracerlpm excel workbook jurgens et al 2012 using a similar approach to cartwright and morgenstern 2015 2016 and cartwright et al 2018 the 3h activity in water sampled from a bore at time t co t is related to the input of 3h ci over time via the convolution integral 1 c o t 0 c i t œÑ g œÑ e Œª œÑ d œÑ in eq 1 œÑ is the residence time t œÑ is the time of recharge Œªis the decay constant 0 0563 yr 1 for 3h and g œÑ is the response function that describes the distribution of flow paths and tracer concentrations in the aquifer the 3h input function is based on the annual average 3h activities of rainfall in adelaide tadros et al 2014 international atomic energy agency 2017 3h activities of rainfall in adelaide peaked at approximately 50 tu in 1965 and then declined exponentially to present day values of 2 4 2 8 tu a present day 3h activity of 2 6 tu which is within that range and similar to the 3h activity of surface water on the pike floodplain table s1 was adopted a 3h activity of 2 6 tu was also used for rainfall from the years before the atmospheric nuclear tests because recharge is likely to occur near vertically the dispersion model that is derived from the one dimensional advection dispersion transport equation was used to calculate mean residence times this model requires a dispersion parameter dp which defines the importance of dispersion relative to advection to be defined dp values of 0 1 0 5 which are appropriate for metre scale flow systems maloszewski 2000 were adopted however because the form of the flow path is not explicitly known mean residence times were also calculated using the exponential and exponential piston flow models the exponential flow model applies to unconfined aquifers with an exponential distribution of flow paths the exponential piston flow model may be applied to flow systems with vertical recharge and exponential flow below the water table for the exponential piston flow model the epm ratio specifies the relative importance of piston flow and exponential flow in this study epm ratios of 0 33 which represents 25 piston flow and 75 exponential flow and 0 5 50 piston flow and 50 exponential flow were used lumped parameter models with similar parameters dp or epm ratios commonly reproduce the predicted variation in 3h activities over time in shallow groundwater or water discharging into streams in other catchments e g maloszewski 2000 morgenstern and daughney 2012 morgenstern et al 2015 the range of parameters used in the models allows sensitivity to the assumed model geometry to be assessed 2 4 mixing the predicted covariance of 3h and 14c activities was also calculated using the dispersion exponential and exponential piston flow lumped parameter models via tracerlpm the 14c input function especially for the period following the atmospheric nuclear tests is more difficult to define than the 3h input function the 14c activities of atmospheric co2 e g reimer et al 2013 clark 2015 are commonly used in these calculations the peak atmospheric 14c activities recorded during the 1950s and 1960s was 190 pmc clark 2015 however much of the dic in groundwater is derived from dissolution of co2 in the soil zone during recharge clark 2015 because the cycling of carbon through the biosphere takes years to decades the 14c activities of soil co2 are lower and lag behind those of the atmosphere as specific estimates of the 14c activities of soil co2 for this region are not available an input function based on the 14c activities of soil co2 elsewhere jenkinson et al 1992 kuc et al 2004 tipping et al 2010 was used those studies suggest that the 14c activity of soil zone co2 increased from 95 pmc prior to the bomb pulse to 115 130 pmc in the early 1990s and declined to 110 115 pmc in the mid late 2000s the pre bomb pulse 14c activities are from reimer et al 2013 the water recharging these aquifers is partially derived from river water inundating the floodplain and calcite in the floodplain sediments is terrestrial thus the Œ¥13c values of both the dic and the calcite are thus difficult to constrain and likely variable cartwright and morgenstern 2012 meredith et al 2016 while quantification of calcite dissolution by isotope mass balance is not feasible the degree of calcite dissolution in siliceous aquifers such as these is likely to be 15 clark 2015 3 results 3 1 major ion geochemistry the tds concentrations of groundwater from the monoman formation at pike ranged from 22 300 to 46 400 mg l there is no correlation of tds with depth in the monoman formation or with proximity to the anabranches by contrast the tds concentrations of monoman formation groundwater at katarapko range from 470 to 44 500 mg l and the lowest salinity water is from within 50 m of the river murray the tds concentrations of groundwater from the coonambidgal formation at pike range from 47 500 to 55 900 mg l and are not correlated with the salinity of the underlying monoman formation groundwater the surface water at pike collected from the anabranch pools has tds concentrations of 264 315 mg l as is almost invariably the case in the murray basin herczeg et al 2001 harrington et al 2005 cartwright et al 2008 2017b na is the dominant cation in the groundwater 72 93 of total cations on a molar basis and cl is the dominant anion 62 96 of total anions with the relative percentage of cl increasing with increasing tds figs 3 and 4 molar na cl ratios of the groundwater are 0 73 1 43 fig 4b which are broadly similar to those of rainfall in the murray basin blackburn and mcleod 1983 molar na cl ratios of the surface water are 2 7 molar cl br ratios of the groundwater are 730 960 fig 4a which are similar to those of saline groundwater elsewhere in the murray basin cartwright et al 2006 2008 2010 and slightly higher than those of ocean water 650 davis et al 1998 or the expected cl br ratio of local rainfall 650 cartwright et al 2006 cl br ratios of the surface water are broadly similar to those of the groundwater 570 840 3 2 stable isotopes the Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values of both groundwater and surface water lie to the right of the global meteoric water line the surface water from the anabranches at pike has Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values of 2 7 to 2 5 and 23 to 21 respectively these are similar to the Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values of irrigation water which represents evaporated river murray water from loxton harrington et al 2005 groundwater from pike and katarapko has Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values of 3 7 to 2 4 and 34 to 22 respectively fig 5 that overlap those of regional groundwater in this area harrington et al 2005 the lower salinity tds 6000 mg l groundwater from katarapko has similar Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values to the surface water from the pike anabranches the river murray at renmark has recorded Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values of 6 0 to 1 7 and 40 to 15 respectively simpson and herczeg 1991 the higher Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values characterise periods of low flow and reflect the influence of evaporation in the storages and the river during high streamflows the river murray as a whole has relatively low Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values reflecting the large input of water from the headwater regions coupled with less in river evaporation simpson and herczeg 1991 cartwright et al 2010 2011 3 3 14c and 3h activities surface water at pike has 3h activities of 2 51 2 63 tu and 14c activities of 97 105 pmc fig 1 table s1 the 3h activities are within the range of those expected for recent rainfall in this region 2 4 2 8 tu tadros et al 2014 and similar to those recorded in river systems elsewhere in southeast australia cartwright and morgenstern 2015 2016 cartwright et al 2018 the 14c activities are characteristic of modern waters that have some component of bomb pulse 14c e g clark 2015 the groundwater from pike and katarapko has 3h activities between 0 02 and 2 32 tu and 14c activities between 40 and 105 pmc fig 1 table s1 groundwater 3h activities are negatively correlated with tds concentrations r2 0 85 fig 6 a 14c activities and tds concentrations have a weaker negative correlation r2 0 30 fig 6b however the lowest salinity groundwater tds 6000 mg l has the highest 14c activities 104 105 pmc groundwater 3h activities at pike are not correlated with distance to the anabranches fig 1d however there is a general decrease in 3h activities with depth in the monoman formation fig 7 b with one exception bore 7029 2852 the 3h activities at individual sites are lower in the deeper monoman groundwater and 3h activities 0 2 tu only occur at depths of 10 m the coonambidgal formation groundwater has 3h activities of 0 23 0 25 tu that are lower than those of the shallow monoman groundwater at the same locations 0 41 0 84 tu fig 1d there is less systematic variation in the 14c activities with depth at pike although groundwater with 14c activities 80 pmc mainly occurs at 15 m depth and groundwater at 15 m depth has 14c activities 70 pmc fig 7a as with the 3h activities there is no systematic variation of 14c activities with position on the floodplain fig 1d the low salinity groundwater from bores 7029 1596 7029 1600 and 7029 1602 at katarapko has high 14c 104 105 pmc and 1 51 2 35 tu 3h activities these bores sample shallow 6 m generally low salinity groundwater adjacent to the main river murray channel fig 1c deeper 6 20 m higher salinity groundwater on the floodplain at katarapko has lower 14c 76 pmc and 3h 0 13 tu activities deep regional groundwater from this part of the murray basin commonly has 14c activities that are below detection harrington et al 2005 monoman formation groundwater from loxton has 14c activities of 51 93 pmc n 3 which are within the range of the 14c activities of groundwater from pike and katarapko groundwater from the loxton sands at loxton has 14c activities of 32 96 pmc n 10 harrington et al 2005 4 discussion the combined geochemical data allows the processes that have affected the groundwater and the patterns of recharge and mixing on the floodplains to be understood 4 1 geochemical processes the following observations indicate that in common with groundwater throughout the murray basin e g herczeg et al 2001 cartwright et al 2008 evapotranspiration is the dominant process that controls the salinity of the groundwater and surface water other processes such as mineral dissolution or precipitation and ion exchange have minor impacts firstly the molar cl br ratios of the groundwater are well below those expected if significant halite dissolution had occurred generally 10 000 15 000 davis et al 1998 cartwright et al 2006 and do not vary with increasing tds fig 4 inland rainfall is expected to have similar or lower cl br ratios than the oceans 650 davis et al 1998 the observation that the cl br ratios of most groundwater in this region are slightly higher than those of rainfall up to 940 imply that minor dissolution of halite possibly from windblown dust has occurred but that evapotranspiration is the dominant process herczeg and edmunds 2000 herczeg et al 2001 cartwright et al 2006 2010 secondly the molar na cl ratios of most of the groundwater are also similar to those of local rainfall fig 4 only the lower salinity groundwater from katarapko tds 470 mg l has higher na cl ratios up to 1 5 while na cl ratios in the surface water are up to 2 8 fig 4 these higher na cl rations may be produced by minor weathering of albitic feldspar e g herczeg and edmunds 2000 which is common in the clastic sediments in the murray basin a decrease in na cl ratios in the most saline groundwater may be due to cation exchange e g herczeg et al 2001 cartwright et al 2008 the reduction in the relative proportion of hco3 in the most saline groundwater figs 3 and 4 is likely due to the precipitation of calcite during evapotranspiration herczeg et al 2001 the observation that the Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values of groundwater and surface water in this part of the murray basin lie to the right of the global meteoric water line is also consistent with evaporation occurring clark 2015 the highest Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values are consistent with evaporation of water with the stable isotope ratios of the river murray at high flows fig 5 4 2 recharge and mixing on the floodplain the 3h activities of groundwater from the pike and katarapko floodplains are above the detection limit implying that there has been some recharge within the last 100 years related to periods of high river levels and inundation i e the floodplains are still active recharge areas and the low salinity groundwater is not a relic of previous hydrological regimes fig 8 shows the predicted trends for 3h and 14c activities for the situation where the recharging groundwater does not mix with older water in the aquifer the overall trends in 3h and 14c activities calculated using the different lumped parameter models are similar additionally the covariance of 3h and 14c activities calculated using the estimated soil zone 14c activities are similar to those calculated using the atmospheric 14c activities albeit without the predicted high 14c activities which represent the relic bomb pulse 14c at moderate 3h activities although there are no limestones or calcite rich sediments on the floodplain dissolution of 14c free pedogenic or vein calcite may reduce 14c activities pedogenic and vein carbonates potentially have a wide range of Œ¥13c values and dic in the infiltrating water derived from the river also has variable Œ¥13c values cartwright et al 2013 clark 2015 meredith et al 2016 hence it is not possible to use the Œ¥13c values of dic to estimate the proportion of calcite dissolution however assuming that calcite dissolution in siliceous aquifers contributes 15 of the dic clark 2015 there is little difference to the predicted trends in 3h and 14c activities the floodplain at pike is normally a zone of regional groundwater discharge fig 9 the groundwater in the coonambidgal formation is geochemically similar to that in the monoman formation which suggests that during periods where the floodplains are not inundated groundwater discharge may also occur through this formation at pike the observation that the groundwater 3h activities decrease with depth in the monoman formation but are not correlated with proximity to the anabranches implies that recharge is through the floodplain during the episodic periods of inundation rather than by lateral flow from the anabranches fig 9 because the 3h activities in groundwater from the overlying coonambidgal formation are locally lower than those in the monoman formation recharge must be through preferential pathways in the coonambidgal the coonambidgal clays crack when dry which may provide pathways of preferential infiltration alternatively connected zones of higher hydraulic conductivity coarser grained sediments may exist within the coonambidgal formation the low salinity groundwater at pike close to the river murray fig 1 that was not sampled in this study may represent local bank recharge limited 50 m width bank recharge in areas where the floodplain receives discharge has been observed elsewhere in the murray basin cartwright et al 2010 at pike the 3h and 14c activities of much of the groundwater imply that mixing between older and younger water has occurred this is most obvious in the monoman formation groundwater that has moderate 14c activities but 3h activities that are well above background fig 8 given the conceptualisation of recharge at pike discussed above the mixing is most likely to be between younger water derived from the river murray when it inundates the floodplains and deeper regional groundwater this scenario is consistent with the Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values of groundwater from the floodplains that lie between those expected for evaporated river water and the regional groundwater fig 5 additionally the 3h activities vs tds concentrations fig 6a imply mixing between surface water low tds and high 3h and regional groundwater high tds and 3h free while the 14c activities and tds concentrations of groundwater from the floodplains are also intermediate between those of surface water and regional groundwater the trend is less regular fig 6b this may be due to the regional groundwater having a range of 14c activities e g harrington et al 2005 reports 14c activities in the loxton formation of between 0 and 96 pmc additionally the 14c activity of the mixed water is a function of both the 14c activities and dic concentrations of the endmembers which also may be variable the patterns of groundwater recharge at katarapko are harder to discern due to the sparse dataset the locally high 3h and 14c activities adjacent to the main river murray channel suggests that some recharge occurs through the banks which is similar to the floodplains at nyah colignan victoria and chowilla jolly et al 1994 lamontagne et al 2005 holland et al 2009 cartwright et al 2010 fig 9 however there are insufficient data to determine whether direct recharge on the floodplain also occurs based on the 3h and 14c activities there is less evidence of mixing in the groundwater at katarapko which may relate to the pattern of recharge recharge through the riverbank and net flow away from the river may inhibit mixing with the regional groundwater the higher salinity groundwater that has higher 14c activities than the regional groundwater but 3h activities close to background may represent mixing at the distal edge of the lower salinity lens between water that has a residence time of several decades and the much older regional groundwater a geochemical transition zone at the distal edge of the lower salinity lens at nyah colignan is also produced in this way cartwright et al 2010 4 3 residence times while mixing complicates the estimation of groundwater residence times some general estimates of how long ago recharge happened may be made the variation of 3h activities and tds concentrations fig 6a suggests that decay of 3h has occurred in addition to mixing while there is some uncertainty in the mixing line the low salinity end member probably has a 3h activity of between 1 8 and 2 2 tu which is lower than the 3h activity of 2 6 tu of local rainfall and the water in the anabranches using a 3h activity of 2 0 tu for the low salinity endmember the mean residence time estimated using the dispersion lumped parameter model is 7 0 dp 0 1 to 8 4 dp 0 5 years as has been noted in other studies cartwright and morgenstern 2015 2016 residence times in samples with high 3h activities are relatively insensitive to the model parameters and the other lumped parameter models yield comparable mean residence times for example the exponential piston flow model yields a mean residence time of 7 1 epm 0 5 to 7 5 epm 0 33 years while the exponential model yields a mean residence time of 9 2 years aside from the variations resulting from the use of different lumped parameter models the calculated mean residence times are subject to a number of other uncertainties allowing the 3h activity of modern rainfall to vary between 2 4 and 2 8 tu based on the range for individual localities from tadros et al 2014 results in mean transit times estimated from the dispersion model of between 7 and 10 years uncertainties in the bomb pulse 3h activities have little impact as the fraction of water recharged at that time in the samples is small propagation of the analytical uncertainty of 2 results in an uncertainty of 1 year evapotranspiration increases the tds concentrations in the water and decreases the estimated 3h activity of the low salinity end member fig 6a which in turn increases the estimated residence time however unless the recharging water has a cl concentration that is much greater than that in the anabranches this has a minor effect slightly higher or lower 3h activities of the low salinity end member would result in shorter or longer residence times regardless recharge of low salinity water most likely occurred a few years prior to this study major inundation of the river murray floodplain occurred during 2010 and 2011 murray darling basin association 2017 and while it is not possible to unambiguously link recharge to specific events significant floodplain recharge would be expected to have occurred at that time 5 conclusions the river murray floodplains are dynamic environments that locally receive both regional groundwater discharge and active recharge the contrasting patterns of recharge on river murray floodplains documented by this study and jolly et al 1994 lamontagne et al 2005 holland et al 2006 2009 and cartwright et al 2010 are probably due to a combination of factors parts of the floodplain such as pike occur in regional groundwater discharge areas where the river murray is likely to be gaining at these sites the surface water levels required to achieve widespread recharge of the floodplain may be higher than can be achieved at bank full conditions necessitating inundation the anabranches at pike have fine grained sediments on their bed and banks which also may inhibit flow into the surrounding aquifers from these channels recharge through the low hydraulic conductivity coonambidgal formation is probably via preferential recharge pathways either interconnected sandy layers or cracks that open up during dry periods by contrast other parts of the floodplain such as katarapko have deeper water tables and recharge may be possible through the banks of the river murray at high river stages but without inundation the flows of the river murray are highly manipulated and water diversion schemes exist on many floodplains in this region thus periods of inundation may be readily achieved that would allow recharge at sites such as pike the high 3h activities of the shallow groundwater at pike confirm that appropriate conditions for recharge occurred in the last few years since mixing between discharging regional groundwater and recently infiltrated water occurs on those floodplains prolonged periods without inundation would result in persistent discharge onto the floodplain and an increase in salinity of the groundwater and soil water due to evapotranspiration additionally increases in the head gradients caused by land clearing and or irrigation on the higher areas adjacent to the floodplains may result in the head gradients not reversing during inundation which would also cause the lenses to degrade lenses of fresh or at least lower salinity groundwater exist in many catchments globally and in semi arid areas they are a vital source of water for ecosystems laattoe et al 2017 geochemical tracers especially radioisotopes are important for confirming that recharge still occurs and that the low salinity waters are not palaeowaters and for determining the patterns of recharge and mixing on the floodplain where recharge is episodic it may also be possible to use radioisotopes to link recharge events to specific episodes of inundation this information is particularly important for lenses formed in groundwater discharge areas where recharge requires local reversals of the head gradients and is thus more sensitive to specific conditions declaration of interests none acknowledgements adrian costar daniel wohling and tariq laattoe

6730,floodplains may alternate between discharge zones for regional groundwater and areas of recharge from river water during high flow events understanding the mechanisms and timescales of recharge on floodplains is important for their management and for the protection of fragile ecosystems the floodplains of the river murray host important ecosystems particularly remnant eucalypt forests that are vulnerable to changes in inundation rising regional water tables and salt accumulation this study addresses floodplain recharge and groundwater mixing on the pike and katarapko floodplains of south australia at pike 3h activities of groundwater in the low hydraulic conductivity coonambidgal formation that crops out on the floodplain are 0 25 tu 3h activities of groundwater in the underlying higher hydraulic conductivity monoman formation decrease from 1 tu near the contact with the coonambidgal formation to 0 02 tu at 15 m depth groundwater 14c activities are between 40 and 95 pmc but are less well correlated with depth the 3h or 14c activities do not vary systematically with distance from the surface water channels on the floodplains these observations imply that groundwater recharge at pike is dominantly through the floodplain rather than through the channel banks in contrast to the regional groundwater where total dissolved solids tds concentrations are commonly 35 000 mg l the tds of groundwater on the floodplain is locally 500 mg l a correlation between 3h activities and tds and the presence of groundwater with relatively low 14c activities but above detection 3h activities implies that recently recharged waters have mixed with regional groundwater in the floodplain sediments the 3h activities in these mixed waters implies that mixing occurs over a few years by contrast at katarapko the highest 3h activities in the monoman formation groundwater up to 2 35 tu are closer to the murray river implying that recharge through the bank may occur these contrasting patterns of recharge probably reflect local topographic controls understanding the recharge discharge relationships are vital for managing proposed floodplain inundation programs

modified due to the diversion of water for agriculture industry or domestic use puckridge et al 2000 northcott et al 2007 ellis et al 2017 stone et al 2017 additionally to protect infrastructure developed on floodplains the magnitude and frequency of floods is commonly reduced by regulating flows these modifications may have major impacts on floodplain hydrogeology and ecology floodplains represent the interface between regional groundwater systems and rivers and may be groundwater discharge or recharge zones e g lamontagne et al 2005 cartwright et al 2010 2011 cend√≥n et al 2010 in some cases groundwater discharge and recharge occur in alternating river reaches telfer et al 2005 bekesi et al 2014 or in the same locations at different river stages jolly et al 1994 where the regional groundwater is saline lenses of relatively young lower salinity groundwater also commonly referred to as freshwater lenses laattoe et al 2017 may form by recharge of the floodplain aquifers by river water lamontagne et al 2005 holland et al 2009 cartwright et al 2010 werner and laattoe 2016 laattoe et al 2017 these lower salinity lenses are locally important in sustaining riverine ecosystems such as forests on the floodplain in rivers that alternate between gaining and losing the lower salinity lenses also form a buffer against saline regional groundwater discharging into the river at low streamflows cartwright et al 2011 telfer et al 2012 documenting the patterns and timescales of groundwater recharge and mixing on floodplains is critical to the management of lower salinity lenses in particular it is important to document whether recharge through the floodplains rather than flow through riverbanks is required to recharge the groundwater in the lower salinity lens where the lenses are formed by recharge through the floodplain periodic floodplain inundation is required to maintain the low salinity groundwater by contrast if the lenses are replenished via recharge through the riverbanks they may be maintained by high river stages without floodplain inundation 1 1 estimating timescales of recharge and mixing tritium 3h with a half life of 12 32 years is commonly used to estimate groundwater residence times and recharge rates where these are less than 100 years cartwright and morgenstern 2012 morgenstern and daughney 2012 clark 2015 cartwright et al 2017a 3h is part of the water molecule and thus geochemical or biogeochemical reactions in the soils or aquifers do not affect its abundance rainfall 3h activities peaked in the 1950s 1960s due to the production of 3h in atmospheric thermonuclear tests the bomb pulse e g tadros et al 2014 clark 2015 due to the distribution of the atmospheric nuclear tests bomb pulse 3h activities in the southern hemisphere were much lower than in the northern hemisphere and the remnant bomb pulse 3h has now largely decayed below the activities of modern rainfall this situation permits residence times to be more readily calculated from 3h activities morgenstern et al 2010 radioisotopes are also valuable in understanding mixing within aquifer systems because 14c and 3h have significantly different half lives 12 32 and 5730 years respectively much of the 3h in groundwater will have decayed before substantial 14c decay occurs this results in groundwater from flow systems that do not exhibit mixing having low to moderate 14c activities and below detection 3h activities by contrast mixing of young groundwater with high 14c and 3h activities with older groundwater that is 3h free and has lower 14c activities results in groundwater with low to moderate 14c activities but above background 3h le gal la salle et al 2001 cartwright et al 2007 2010 2013 2017a the use of 3h and 14c to detect groundwater mixing is relatively unaffected by the assumed geometries of the flow system cartwright et al 2013 2017a however other processes that reduce groundwater 14c activities e g calcite dissolution and methanogenesis complicate the quantification of mixing 1 2 river murray floodplains the murray darling river system drains 106 km2 of eastern australia and is australia s largest river system hart 2015 the lower reaches of the darling river and the entirety of the river murray are contained within the murray basin the total dissolved solids tds concentrations of murray basin groundwater varies widely with tds concentrations up to 200 000 mg l and commonly 35 000 mg l in much of the central basin herczeg et al 2001 cartwright et al 2008 2017b lower salinity lenses containing groundwater with tds concentrations of 10 000 mg l are locally developed along the murray and darling rivers and their tributaries lamontagne et al 2005 cartwright et al 2010 werner and laattoe 2016 laattoe et al 2017 in the downstream reaches of the river murray groundwater from these lower salinity lenses is vital for sustaining the riverine ecosystems notably the remnant eucalyptus forests of river red gum black box and ironbark jolly et al 1994 kingsford 2000 lamontagne et al 2005 holland et al 2006 2009 doody et al 2009 large scale irrigation using river murray water began in the 1880s and the flows of the river murray have been highly regulated since the 1920s e g hart 2015 murray darling basin authority 2017 some 42 of the murray darling basin river water is currently diverted largely for agriculture and flow is further moderated by a series of storages hart 2015 murray darling basin authority 2017 whereas under natural conditions the floodplains would have been inundated every few years inundation now occurs far less frequently and is less extensive montazeri and mccullough 2015a b additionally land clearing and irrigation on the higher land adjacent to the rivers has resulted in additional recharge that has caused the regional water table to rise this has led to the development of saline discharge areas on the floodplain degradation of the lower salinity lenses increased discharge of saline water to the river murray and salinization of floodplain wetlands and soils these changes to the hydrogeology have damaged floodplain ecosystems in recent years there have been efforts to redress these changes by increasing river levels through a suite of management actions commonly termed environmental watering kingsford 2000 holland et al 2009 environmental watering includes floodplain inundation that replenishes surface water bodies promote seedling recruitment and increases soil moisture it also induces recharge on the floodplain and lowers the salinity of the shallow groundwater underlying the floodplain between 2013 and 2016 there were over 750 inundation events in the lower and middle reaches of the river murray murray darling basin authority 2017 however assessing the likely efficacy of these measures requires that the floodplain hydrogeology at the individual sites is well understood previous studies of groundwater geochemistry radioactive isotopes groundwater elevations and the stable isotope ratios and moisture contents of soils and trees have concluded locally that the groundwater of the river murray floodplains in victoria and south australia are recharged both through inundation and via the riverbanks jolly et al 1994 bramley et al 2003 holland et al 2006 2009 lamontagne et al 2005 cartwright et al 2010 if recharge of the floodplains occurs dominantly via the banks of the main river or its anabranches the inundation events may require lower volumes of water to protect or re establish lower salinity lenses compared with sites where floodplain recharge occurs in addition inundation may raise the water table adjacent to the inundated area and adversely affect adjacent lower salinity lenses purczel et al 2016 1 3 objectives the aim of this study is to understand groundwater recharge on two contrasting saline floodplains of the river murray in south australia where major engineering works are under construction to allow inundation firstly we aim to determine whether active recharge currently occurs on these floodplains or whether the low salinity groundwater is a relic of previous hydrogeological regimes further we address whether recharge occurred through the floodplain or via the banks of the anabranches finally we examines the timescales of mixing of saline regional groundwater with water recharged on the floodplains resolution of these objectives informs the management of the river murray floodplains in particular the inundation program while the study is based on specific sites the results have implications for understanding and managing floodplain processes in other semi arid areas 1 4 study area this study is based on the pike and katarapko floodplains of the river murray near renmark south australia fig 1 the area is semi arid with a mean annual rainfall of 260 mm that dominantly falls within the austral winter and an annual potential evapotranspiration rate of 1100 mm bureau of meteorology 2017 the floodplains retain remnant native vegetation with river red gums close to the river murray and black box and ironbark forests elsewhere on the floodplain jolly et al 1994 harrington et al 2005 holland et al 2006 2009 doody et al 2009 most of the upland areas away from the river have been cleared for agriculture including irrigated and dryland wheat horticulture including citrus vegetables grapes and nuts and grazing the geology and hydrogeology of this part of the murray basin is described by harrington et al 2005 holland et al 2006 doody et al 2009 and purczel et al 2016 fig 2 the upland areas away from the river murray comprise the miocene to pliocene loxton sands which is a partially confined regional aquifer consisting of medium to coarse grained sands with local finer grained layers the loxton sands is locally overlain by the early pleistocene blanchetown clay which forms a regional aquitard and the unconsolidated sands silts and clays of the holocene woorinen formation the clay rich low hydraulic conductivity lower loxton clay and bookpurnong formation restrict flow between the loxton sands and deeper units such as the limestones of the murray group the river murray floodplains contain sediments belonging to the pleistocene to holocene monoman and coonambidgal formations fig 2 the monoman formation comprises fine to coarse grained fluviatile sands with minor clay and silt layers this formation is typically 10 20 m thick harrington et al 2005 and generally overlies the lower parts of the loxton sands or the lower loxton clay and bookpurnong formation aquitard the coonambidgal formation is the shallowest floodplain unit and consists of up to 10 m of low hydraulic conductivity silts and clays deposited by flood events purczel et al 2016 the coonambidgal formation may be locally absent or overlain by dune sands the main channel of the river murray and some of its anabranches are incised through the coonambidgal formation into the monoman formation while other anabranches lie entirely within the coonambidgal formation in common with much of the central murray basin herczeg et al 2001 cartwright et al 2008 2017b harrington et al 2005 groundwater in the loxton sands commonly has tds concentrations of 30 000 mg l locally up to 100 000 mg l the tds of groundwater from the monoman formation on the floodplain varies from 500 mg l to 90 000 mg l harrington et al 2005 purczel et al 2016 some of the low salinity groundwater is associated with recharge from the river murray where the river level has been artificially raised behind storages locally referred to as locks groundwater heads in the shallow aquifers at pike decrease towards the river murray and the heads in the deeper aquifers below the bookpurnong formation are higher than those in the shallower units harrington et al 2005 purczel et al 2016 consequently the pike floodplain is a discharge area and groundwater discharge sites marked by saline water and gypsum deposits occur on the floodplain upward head gradients and in river nano tem surveys indicate that the murray river and the anabranches in the pike area are predominantly gaining purczel et al 2016 the water table at katarapko is deeper than at pike while local groundwater discharge sites occur at katarapko the deeper groundwater and distribution of heads suggests the river murray in this area may be locally losing at both sites inundation of the floodplain probably reverses upward head gradients allowing recharge through the floodplain to occur the difference in recharge discharge behaviour between the two sites is reflected in the groundwater salinity and ecosystem health katarapko has more extensive regions of lower salinity groundwater than pike fig 1 vegetation surveys show that healthy trees exist at both sites but that there is a higher prevalence of dead trees at pike michelle denny dew pers comm 8 may 2018 both katarapko and pike floodplains have been targeted for improved environmental management by the south australian riverland floodplain integrated infrastructure program sarfiip purczel et al 2016 this involves engineering works including the construction of regulators on anabranches and blocking banks which enable extensive flooding of the floodplains or contain floodwaters to specific floodplain areas 2 sampling and analytical techniques 2 1 sampling groundwater was sampled from monitoring bores in the coonambidgal and monoman formations distributed throughout the pike and katarapko floodplains fig 1 table s1 using an impeller pump set in the screened interval sampling commenced once field parameters had stabilised at pike the shallow monoman samples are from 1 to 2 m below the contact with the coonambidgal formation while the deeper monoman samples are several metres below the contact surface water samples at pike were collected from pools in anabranches on the floodplain that were not flowing at the time of sampling 2 2 analytical techniques geochemical data is presented in the supplement table s1 electrical conductivity ec was measured with a calibrated tps meter and probe hco3 concentrations were determined using a hach digital titrator and reagents with a precision of 5 major ion concentrations and stable isotope ratios were analysed at monash university anion concentrations were determined using a thermo fisher ion chromatograph on filtered unacidified samples cation concentrations were determined using a thermo fisher icp oes on samples that had been filtered through 0 45 ¬µm cellulose nitrate filters and acidified to ph 2 using double distilled 16 m hno3 the precision of anion and cation analyses based on replicate analyses is 2 and the accuracy based on analysis of certified water standards is 5 charge balance errors range from 5 6 to 5 4 median 1 8 tds concentrations are the sum of the dissolved major ions stable isotope ratios were determined using a thermo finnigan deltaplus mass spectrometer Œ¥18o analysis was by equilibration of h2o with he co2 at 32 c for 24 48 h in a thermo finnigan gas bench Œ¥2h analysis utilised reduction of h2o with cr at 850 c in an automated finnigan mat h device co2 from dissolved inorganic carbon dic was liberated by acidification using h3po4 in a he atmosphere in a thermo finnigan gas bench stable isotope ratios were normalised using a range of international and internal standards following coplen 1988 and are expressed in per mil notation relative to v smow Œ¥18o Œ¥2h or v pdb Œ¥13c precision œÉ based on replicate analysis is 0 15 for Œ¥18o 0 2 for Œ¥13c and 1 for Œ¥18h 14c activities were measured by accelerator mass spectrometer at gns new zealand using methods summarised by stewart et al 2016 dic was converted to co2 through acidification using orthophosphoric acid in sealed glass vessels the co2 was collected and purified cryogenically under vacuum and converted to graphite which formed the target for the accelerator mass spectrometer measurement 14c activities are expressed as percent modern carbon pmc where the 14c activity of modern carbon is 95 of the 14c activity of the nbs oxalic acid standard in 1950 uncertainties range from 0 07 at close to 0 pmc to 0 8 pmc at 100 pmc 3h activities were determined at gns new zealand using liquid scintillation in quantulus ultra low level counters on samples that had been vacuum distilled and electrolytically enriched morgenstern and taylor 2009 3h activities are expressed in tritium units tu where 1 tu represents a 3h 1h ratio of 1 10 18 tritium enrichment is by a factor of 95 which yields a detection limit of 0 02 tu and the relative precision 1œÉ at a 3h activity of 1 tu is 2 table s1 2 3 mean residence times the relatively small dataset and the possibility that mixing has occurred precludes a detailed analysis of groundwater residence times approximate mean residence times were estimated from the 3h activities using lumped parameter models maloszewski 2000 as implemented in the tracerlpm excel workbook jurgens et al 2012 using a similar approach to cartwright and morgenstern 2015 2016 and cartwright et al 2018 the 3h activity in water sampled from a bore at time t co t is related to the input of 3h ci over time via the convolution integral 1 c o t 0 c i t œÑ g œÑ e Œª œÑ d œÑ in eq 1 œÑ is the residence time t œÑ is the time of recharge Œªis the decay constant 0 0563 yr 1 for 3h and g œÑ is the response function that describes the distribution of flow paths and tracer concentrations in the aquifer the 3h input function is based on the annual average 3h activities of rainfall in adelaide tadros et al 2014 international atomic energy agency 2017 3h activities of rainfall in adelaide peaked at approximately 50 tu in 1965 and then declined exponentially to present day values of 2 4 2 8 tu a present day 3h activity of 2 6 tu which is within that range and similar to the 3h activity of surface water on the pike floodplain table s1 was adopted a 3h activity of 2 6 tu was also used for rainfall from the years before the atmospheric nuclear tests because recharge is likely to occur near vertically the dispersion model that is derived from the one dimensional advection dispersion transport equation was used to calculate mean residence times this model requires a dispersion parameter dp which defines the importance of dispersion relative to advection to be defined dp values of 0 1 0 5 which are appropriate for metre scale flow systems maloszewski 2000 were adopted however because the form of the flow path is not explicitly known mean residence times were also calculated using the exponential and exponential piston flow models the exponential flow model applies to unconfined aquifers with an exponential distribution of flow paths the exponential piston flow model may be applied to flow systems with vertical recharge and exponential flow below the water table for the exponential piston flow model the epm ratio specifies the relative importance of piston flow and exponential flow in this study epm ratios of 0 33 which represents 25 piston flow and 75 exponential flow and 0 5 50 piston flow and 50 exponential flow were used lumped parameter models with similar parameters dp or epm ratios commonly reproduce the predicted variation in 3h activities over time in shallow groundwater or water discharging into streams in other catchments e g maloszewski 2000 morgenstern and daughney 2012 morgenstern et al 2015 the range of parameters used in the models allows sensitivity to the assumed model geometry to be assessed 2 4 mixing the predicted covariance of 3h and 14c activities was also calculated using the dispersion exponential and exponential piston flow lumped parameter models via tracerlpm the 14c input function especially for the period following the atmospheric nuclear tests is more difficult to define than the 3h input function the 14c activities of atmospheric co2 e g reimer et al 2013 clark 2015 are commonly used in these calculations the peak atmospheric 14c activities recorded during the 1950s and 1960s was 190 pmc clark 2015 however much of the dic in groundwater is derived from dissolution of co2 in the soil zone during recharge clark 2015 because the cycling of carbon through the biosphere takes years to decades the 14c activities of soil co2 are lower and lag behind those of the atmosphere as specific estimates of the 14c activities of soil co2 for this region are not available an input function based on the 14c activities of soil co2 elsewhere jenkinson et al 1992 kuc et al 2004 tipping et al 2010 was used those studies suggest that the 14c activity of soil zone co2 increased from 95 pmc prior to the bomb pulse to 115 130 pmc in the early 1990s and declined to 110 115 pmc in the mid late 2000s the pre bomb pulse 14c activities are from reimer et al 2013 the water recharging these aquifers is partially derived from river water inundating the floodplain and calcite in the floodplain sediments is terrestrial thus the Œ¥13c values of both the dic and the calcite are thus difficult to constrain and likely variable cartwright and morgenstern 2012 meredith et al 2016 while quantification of calcite dissolution by isotope mass balance is not feasible the degree of calcite dissolution in siliceous aquifers such as these is likely to be 15 clark 2015 3 results 3 1 major ion geochemistry the tds concentrations of groundwater from the monoman formation at pike ranged from 22 300 to 46 400 mg l there is no correlation of tds with depth in the monoman formation or with proximity to the anabranches by contrast the tds concentrations of monoman formation groundwater at katarapko range from 470 to 44 500 mg l and the lowest salinity water is from within 50 m of the river murray the tds concentrations of groundwater from the coonambidgal formation at pike range from 47 500 to 55 900 mg l and are not correlated with the salinity of the underlying monoman formation groundwater the surface water at pike collected from the anabranch pools has tds concentrations of 264 315 mg l as is almost invariably the case in the murray basin herczeg et al 2001 harrington et al 2005 cartwright et al 2008 2017b na is the dominant cation in the groundwater 72 93 of total cations on a molar basis and cl is the dominant anion 62 96 of total anions with the relative percentage of cl increasing with increasing tds figs 3 and 4 molar na cl ratios of the groundwater are 0 73 1 43 fig 4b which are broadly similar to those of rainfall in the murray basin blackburn and mcleod 1983 molar na cl ratios of the surface water are 2 7 molar cl br ratios of the groundwater are 730 960 fig 4a which are similar to those of saline groundwater elsewhere in the murray basin cartwright et al 2006 2008 2010 and slightly higher than those of ocean water 650 davis et al 1998 or the expected cl br ratio of local rainfall 650 cartwright et al 2006 cl br ratios of the surface water are broadly similar to those of the groundwater 570 840 3 2 stable isotopes the Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values of both groundwater and surface water lie to the right of the global meteoric water line the surface water from the anabranches at pike has Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values of 2 7 to 2 5 and 23 to 21 respectively these are similar to the Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values of irrigation water which represents evaporated river murray water from loxton harrington et al 2005 groundwater from pike and katarapko has Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values of 3 7 to 2 4 and 34 to 22 respectively fig 5 that overlap those of regional groundwater in this area harrington et al 2005 the lower salinity tds 6000 mg l groundwater from katarapko has similar Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values to the surface water from the pike anabranches the river murray at renmark has recorded Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values of 6 0 to 1 7 and 40 to 15 respectively simpson and herczeg 1991 the higher Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values characterise periods of low flow and reflect the influence of evaporation in the storages and the river during high streamflows the river murray as a whole has relatively low Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values reflecting the large input of water from the headwater regions coupled with less in river evaporation simpson and herczeg 1991 cartwright et al 2010 2011 3 3 14c and 3h activities surface water at pike has 3h activities of 2 51 2 63 tu and 14c activities of 97 105 pmc fig 1 table s1 the 3h activities are within the range of those expected for recent rainfall in this region 2 4 2 8 tu tadros et al 2014 and similar to those recorded in river systems elsewhere in southeast australia cartwright and morgenstern 2015 2016 cartwright et al 2018 the 14c activities are characteristic of modern waters that have some component of bomb pulse 14c e g clark 2015 the groundwater from pike and katarapko has 3h activities between 0 02 and 2 32 tu and 14c activities between 40 and 105 pmc fig 1 table s1 groundwater 3h activities are negatively correlated with tds concentrations r2 0 85 fig 6 a 14c activities and tds concentrations have a weaker negative correlation r2 0 30 fig 6b however the lowest salinity groundwater tds 6000 mg l has the highest 14c activities 104 105 pmc groundwater 3h activities at pike are not correlated with distance to the anabranches fig 1d however there is a general decrease in 3h activities with depth in the monoman formation fig 7 b with one exception bore 7029 2852 the 3h activities at individual sites are lower in the deeper monoman groundwater and 3h activities 0 2 tu only occur at depths of 10 m the coonambidgal formation groundwater has 3h activities of 0 23 0 25 tu that are lower than those of the shallow monoman groundwater at the same locations 0 41 0 84 tu fig 1d there is less systematic variation in the 14c activities with depth at pike although groundwater with 14c activities 80 pmc mainly occurs at 15 m depth and groundwater at 15 m depth has 14c activities 70 pmc fig 7a as with the 3h activities there is no systematic variation of 14c activities with position on the floodplain fig 1d the low salinity groundwater from bores 7029 1596 7029 1600 and 7029 1602 at katarapko has high 14c 104 105 pmc and 1 51 2 35 tu 3h activities these bores sample shallow 6 m generally low salinity groundwater adjacent to the main river murray channel fig 1c deeper 6 20 m higher salinity groundwater on the floodplain at katarapko has lower 14c 76 pmc and 3h 0 13 tu activities deep regional groundwater from this part of the murray basin commonly has 14c activities that are below detection harrington et al 2005 monoman formation groundwater from loxton has 14c activities of 51 93 pmc n 3 which are within the range of the 14c activities of groundwater from pike and katarapko groundwater from the loxton sands at loxton has 14c activities of 32 96 pmc n 10 harrington et al 2005 4 discussion the combined geochemical data allows the processes that have affected the groundwater and the patterns of recharge and mixing on the floodplains to be understood 4 1 geochemical processes the following observations indicate that in common with groundwater throughout the murray basin e g herczeg et al 2001 cartwright et al 2008 evapotranspiration is the dominant process that controls the salinity of the groundwater and surface water other processes such as mineral dissolution or precipitation and ion exchange have minor impacts firstly the molar cl br ratios of the groundwater are well below those expected if significant halite dissolution had occurred generally 10 000 15 000 davis et al 1998 cartwright et al 2006 and do not vary with increasing tds fig 4 inland rainfall is expected to have similar or lower cl br ratios than the oceans 650 davis et al 1998 the observation that the cl br ratios of most groundwater in this region are slightly higher than those of rainfall up to 940 imply that minor dissolution of halite possibly from windblown dust has occurred but that evapotranspiration is the dominant process herczeg and edmunds 2000 herczeg et al 2001 cartwright et al 2006 2010 secondly the molar na cl ratios of most of the groundwater are also similar to those of local rainfall fig 4 only the lower salinity groundwater from katarapko tds 470 mg l has higher na cl ratios up to 1 5 while na cl ratios in the surface water are up to 2 8 fig 4 these higher na cl rations may be produced by minor weathering of albitic feldspar e g herczeg and edmunds 2000 which is common in the clastic sediments in the murray basin a decrease in na cl ratios in the most saline groundwater may be due to cation exchange e g herczeg et al 2001 cartwright et al 2008 the reduction in the relative proportion of hco3 in the most saline groundwater figs 3 and 4 is likely due to the precipitation of calcite during evapotranspiration herczeg et al 2001 the observation that the Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values of groundwater and surface water in this part of the murray basin lie to the right of the global meteoric water line is also consistent with evaporation occurring clark 2015 the highest Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values are consistent with evaporation of water with the stable isotope ratios of the river murray at high flows fig 5 4 2 recharge and mixing on the floodplain the 3h activities of groundwater from the pike and katarapko floodplains are above the detection limit implying that there has been some recharge within the last 100 years related to periods of high river levels and inundation i e the floodplains are still active recharge areas and the low salinity groundwater is not a relic of previous hydrological regimes fig 8 shows the predicted trends for 3h and 14c activities for the situation where the recharging groundwater does not mix with older water in the aquifer the overall trends in 3h and 14c activities calculated using the different lumped parameter models are similar additionally the covariance of 3h and 14c activities calculated using the estimated soil zone 14c activities are similar to those calculated using the atmospheric 14c activities albeit without the predicted high 14c activities which represent the relic bomb pulse 14c at moderate 3h activities although there are no limestones or calcite rich sediments on the floodplain dissolution of 14c free pedogenic or vein calcite may reduce 14c activities pedogenic and vein carbonates potentially have a wide range of Œ¥13c values and dic in the infiltrating water derived from the river also has variable Œ¥13c values cartwright et al 2013 clark 2015 meredith et al 2016 hence it is not possible to use the Œ¥13c values of dic to estimate the proportion of calcite dissolution however assuming that calcite dissolution in siliceous aquifers contributes 15 of the dic clark 2015 there is little difference to the predicted trends in 3h and 14c activities the floodplain at pike is normally a zone of regional groundwater discharge fig 9 the groundwater in the coonambidgal formation is geochemically similar to that in the monoman formation which suggests that during periods where the floodplains are not inundated groundwater discharge may also occur through this formation at pike the observation that the groundwater 3h activities decrease with depth in the monoman formation but are not correlated with proximity to the anabranches implies that recharge is through the floodplain during the episodic periods of inundation rather than by lateral flow from the anabranches fig 9 because the 3h activities in groundwater from the overlying coonambidgal formation are locally lower than those in the monoman formation recharge must be through preferential pathways in the coonambidgal the coonambidgal clays crack when dry which may provide pathways of preferential infiltration alternatively connected zones of higher hydraulic conductivity coarser grained sediments may exist within the coonambidgal formation the low salinity groundwater at pike close to the river murray fig 1 that was not sampled in this study may represent local bank recharge limited 50 m width bank recharge in areas where the floodplain receives discharge has been observed elsewhere in the murray basin cartwright et al 2010 at pike the 3h and 14c activities of much of the groundwater imply that mixing between older and younger water has occurred this is most obvious in the monoman formation groundwater that has moderate 14c activities but 3h activities that are well above background fig 8 given the conceptualisation of recharge at pike discussed above the mixing is most likely to be between younger water derived from the river murray when it inundates the floodplains and deeper regional groundwater this scenario is consistent with the Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values of groundwater from the floodplains that lie between those expected for evaporated river water and the regional groundwater fig 5 additionally the 3h activities vs tds concentrations fig 6a imply mixing between surface water low tds and high 3h and regional groundwater high tds and 3h free while the 14c activities and tds concentrations of groundwater from the floodplains are also intermediate between those of surface water and regional groundwater the trend is less regular fig 6b this may be due to the regional groundwater having a range of 14c activities e g harrington et al 2005 reports 14c activities in the loxton formation of between 0 and 96 pmc additionally the 14c activity of the mixed water is a function of both the 14c activities and dic concentrations of the endmembers which also may be variable the patterns of groundwater recharge at katarapko are harder to discern due to the sparse dataset the locally high 3h and 14c activities adjacent to the main river murray channel suggests that some recharge occurs through the banks which is similar to the floodplains at nyah colignan victoria and chowilla jolly et al 1994 lamontagne et al 2005 holland et al 2009 cartwright et al 2010 fig 9 however there are insufficient data to determine whether direct recharge on the floodplain also occurs based on the 3h and 14c activities there is less evidence of mixing in the groundwater at katarapko which may relate to the pattern of recharge recharge through the riverbank and net flow away from the river may inhibit mixing with the regional groundwater the higher salinity groundwater that has higher 14c activities than the regional groundwater but 3h activities close to background may represent mixing at the distal edge of the lower salinity lens between water that has a residence time of several decades and the much older regional groundwater a geochemical transition zone at the distal edge of the lower salinity lens at nyah colignan is also produced in this way cartwright et al 2010 4 3 residence times while mixing complicates the estimation of groundwater residence times some general estimates of how long ago recharge happened may be made the variation of 3h activities and tds concentrations fig 6a suggests that decay of 3h has occurred in addition to mixing while there is some uncertainty in the mixing line the low salinity end member probably has a 3h activity of between 1 8 and 2 2 tu which is lower than the 3h activity of 2 6 tu of local rainfall and the water in the anabranches using a 3h activity of 2 0 tu for the low salinity endmember the mean residence time estimated using the dispersion lumped parameter model is 7 0 dp 0 1 to 8 4 dp 0 5 years as has been noted in other studies cartwright and morgenstern 2015 2016 residence times in samples with high 3h activities are relatively insensitive to the model parameters and the other lumped parameter models yield comparable mean residence times for example the exponential piston flow model yields a mean residence time of 7 1 epm 0 5 to 7 5 epm 0 33 years while the exponential model yields a mean residence time of 9 2 years aside from the variations resulting from the use of different lumped parameter models the calculated mean residence times are subject to a number of other uncertainties allowing the 3h activity of modern rainfall to vary between 2 4 and 2 8 tu based on the range for individual localities from tadros et al 2014 results in mean transit times estimated from the dispersion model of between 7 and 10 years uncertainties in the bomb pulse 3h activities have little impact as the fraction of water recharged at that time in the samples is small propagation of the analytical uncertainty of 2 results in an uncertainty of 1 year evapotranspiration increases the tds concentrations in the water and decreases the estimated 3h activity of the low salinity end member fig 6a which in turn increases the estimated residence time however unless the recharging water has a cl concentration that is much greater than that in the anabranches this has a minor effect slightly higher or lower 3h activities of the low salinity end member would result in shorter or longer residence times regardless recharge of low salinity water most likely occurred a few years prior to this study major inundation of the river murray floodplain occurred during 2010 and 2011 murray darling basin association 2017 and while it is not possible to unambiguously link recharge to specific events significant floodplain recharge would be expected to have occurred at that time 5 conclusions the river murray floodplains are dynamic environments that locally receive both regional groundwater discharge and active recharge the contrasting patterns of recharge on river murray floodplains documented by this study and jolly et al 1994 lamontagne et al 2005 holland et al 2006 2009 and cartwright et al 2010 are probably due to a combination of factors parts of the floodplain such as pike occur in regional groundwater discharge areas where the river murray is likely to be gaining at these sites the surface water levels required to achieve widespread recharge of the floodplain may be higher than can be achieved at bank full conditions necessitating inundation the anabranches at pike have fine grained sediments on their bed and banks which also may inhibit flow into the surrounding aquifers from these channels recharge through the low hydraulic conductivity coonambidgal formation is probably via preferential recharge pathways either interconnected sandy layers or cracks that open up during dry periods by contrast other parts of the floodplain such as katarapko have deeper water tables and recharge may be possible through the banks of the river murray at high river stages but without inundation the flows of the river murray are highly manipulated and water diversion schemes exist on many floodplains in this region thus periods of inundation may be readily achieved that would allow recharge at sites such as pike the high 3h activities of the shallow groundwater at pike confirm that appropriate conditions for recharge occurred in the last few years since mixing between discharging regional groundwater and recently infiltrated water occurs on those floodplains prolonged periods without inundation would result in persistent discharge onto the floodplain and an increase in salinity of the groundwater and soil water due to evapotranspiration additionally increases in the head gradients caused by land clearing and or irrigation on the higher areas adjacent to the floodplains may result in the head gradients not reversing during inundation which would also cause the lenses to degrade lenses of fresh or at least lower salinity groundwater exist in many catchments globally and in semi arid areas they are a vital source of water for ecosystems laattoe et al 2017 geochemical tracers especially radioisotopes are important for confirming that recharge still occurs and that the low salinity waters are not palaeowaters and for determining the patterns of recharge and mixing on the floodplain where recharge is episodic it may also be possible to use radioisotopes to link recharge events to specific episodes of inundation this information is particularly important for lenses formed in groundwater discharge areas where recharge requires local reversals of the head gradients and is thus more sensitive to specific conditions declaration of interests none acknowledgements adrian costar daniel wohling and tariq laattoe

6731,in this research a hybrid game theory and mathematical programming model hgt mpm is proposed for solving trans boundary water conflicts in guanting reservoir basin grb between two cities i e zhangjiakou and beijing in north china a water allocation model which considers both water quality and quantity is developed for optimizing water use and pollutant discharge in the two cities maximizing the net aggregate benefits from these activities and reducing the costs for water supply and pollution removal the initial rights of water use and pollutant discharge are allocated to the cities of beijing and zhangjiakou as two players based on the incorporation of a negotiation method for ill defined water rights within the watershed at this stage equal treatment of every player s benefit claim can be addressed the strategy spaces of the two players are delineated through solving the proposed hgt mpm with mutual benefit claim constraints the rubinstein bargaining solution method is employed to identify the equilibrium of bargaining to achieve maximal benefits for the two players starting from allocating the results of the second step the concepts of core and nash solutions of cooperative games are used to generate stable basin wide cooperative solutions both players find it beneficial to cooperate with side payment from the downstream to upstream at this stage the principle of maximum economic benefits is mainly considered the results indicate that unclear initial water rights and pollutant discharge rights can be fairly defined through bilateral negotiations between upstream and downstream without side payment the initial water rights and pollutant discharge allocation will be the final outcome which is suboptimal although it is better than the status quo in term of both total and individual benefits full cooperation with side payment leads to the greatest total net benefits and the greatest benefits to each individual city the results not only provide a basis to allocate trans jurisdictional water rights and pollutant discharge rights in an equal and efficient way but also provide certain inspirations for management policy improvement such as establishing a water right trading system keywords trans boundary water conflict water quantity and quality game theory mathematical programming guanting reservoir basin grb china 1 introduction along with population growth and industrial expansion intensive conflicts over limited water resources are occurring in many countries across the world cai et al 2011 dong et al 2014 decision makers in these countries are facing multiple pressures such as promoting economic development conserving water resources and protecting the environment the induced water conflicts are associated with a variety of socioeconomic political and environmental issues forcing decision makers to contemplate comprehensive strategies among multiple water users yang et al 2008 zeng et al 2017 these water conflicts may be further multiplied by worsening water quality and unclear initial water rights that are associated with jurisdictions within specific basins thus efficient water management requires collaborations among authorities and stakeholders to utilize the limited water resources in a sustainable manner sandoval solis et al 2013 therefore effective tools that can support decision making under conflicts for allocations of water rights and pollutant discharge quotas within river basins are needed in the past decades to deal with trans boundary water conflicts at the basin scale many studies were conducted through the adoption of multiobjective programming mop methods to identify the corresponding water allocating schemes among multiple stakeholders cohon 1978 xevi and khan 2005 roozbahani et al 2014 cai et al 2009a b tan et al 2011 these studies can be generally categorized into two groups haimes and hall 1974 cohon 1978 cai et al 2004 including a methods that can generate noninferior solution sets kucukmehmetoglu and guldmann 2010 roozbahani et al 2014 and b methods that can incorporate multiobjective trade off preferences to identify desired decision alternatives han et al 2011 an important issue of using multiobjective analyses in identifying solutions for solving water conflicts is to represent competing objectives clearly and unambiguously thus they can be understandable and acceptable to the involved parties cai et al 2004 zeng et al 2017 comparatively game theory was used for coordinating trans boundary water conflicts during the settlement of competitive situations induced by the degradation of any shared water resources parrachino et al 2005 madani 2010 bhagabati et al 2014 degefu et al 2016 the concepts of game theory such as noncooperative ones which could consider strategic interactions among stakeholders and any determined agreements disagreements through the maximization of stakeholders payoffs were used to deal with trans boundary water conflict management due to its advantages of self enforcement stability and social acceptability rogers 1969 carraro et al 2007 li et al 2016 madani and hipel 2011 additionally a number of studies regarding cooperative game theory concluded that basin wide cooperation is able to produce higher benefits than individual actions rogers 1993 beeker and easter 1995 1997 wang et al 2003 wang et al 2008a b wu and whittington 2006 teasley and mckinney 2011 liao and hannam 2013 bhagabati et al 2017 islam and susskind 2018 cooperative solutions which mainly focused on having a binding agreement among the players and thus could be used for equitably allocating cooperative benefits were well developed dinar and hogarth 2015 lee 2012 cooperative solutions have been used more frequently than noncooperative game theory because the former can achieve pareto optimal outcomes peters 2008 madani 2010 more recently many mop and mathematical programming models were integrated into a general game theory framework to effectively illustrate and tackle trade offs among relevant stakeholders fallah mehdipour et al 2011 kucukmehmetoglu 2012 degefu et al 2017 kyriazi et al 2017 fu et al 2018a b however the proposed methods did not consider water quality issues when optimizing water allocations among relevant stakeholders due to the many environmental factors inherited in trans boundary water conflicts integrated water quality and quantity allocation methods kerachian and karamouz 2007 bazargan lari et al 2009 mahjouri and ardestani 2010 wei et al 2010 wang et al 2013 were developed to deal with such complexities another problem in cooperative game theory applications was the tendency to use a status quo as a starting point for the realization of benefits from cooperation dombrowsky 2010 poorsepahy samian et al 2012 here a status quo point means each player s independent payoffs if no agreement is achieved and is usually expressed as the net benefits of each player under the current situations of his her water uses and pollutant discharges moreover unclear initial property rights may make the affected stakeholders insist on an equitable distribution of property rights although great efforts have been made in applying multidisciplinary methods to deal with multiple conflicting issues in water management trans jurisdictional water conflicts in specific basins need an integrated framework that can be customized for each individual issue when using cooperative games solutions are described in terms of outcomes for coalitions then each one of the coalitions has its own characteristic function which defines the maximum value of each coalition becker and easter 1997 usually the characteristic function of a subcoalition of one player can be calculated through maximizing an individual value in turns from upstream to downstream which is called the starting point in this paper however such a calculation may cause disputes for those downstream who believe it is favoring the upstream too much especially in an ill defined water rights system instead the downstream may propose an alternative that is different from the staring point leading to different starting points and distribution results how to deal with the influence of unclear initial water rights on the allocations which will result in a starting point that is different from the status quo point is worth researching a trans jurisdictional water conflict combining water quantity and quality issues in the context of unclear initial water rights is now occurring in the guanting reservoir basin grb of north china the preliminary evaluation results of a water environmental protection plan for the grb from 2001 to 2014 li et al 2018 showed that the planning target has not yet been achieved the water quality of the guanting reservoir is inferior to the water environmental function requirements no exact evidence showed that the point source pollutant discharge has been effectively controlled li et al 2018 the previous research allocated economic benefits from cooperation that was mainly based on accepting the status quo as the starting point namely the upstream was free to use water due to the good hydrological conditions but the downstream economic social and ecological water use could not be considered yang et al 2008 however the previous allocation method may be invalid when a player rejected the status quo as his her starting point or each player would insist on his her favorable claims due to unclear water rights as a starting point to cooperation additionally they neglected the solutions if players failed in achieving cooperation with side payments to overcome these deficiencies a hybrid game theory and mathematical programming model hgt mpm will be proposed for solving trans boundary water conflicts in the guanting reservoir basin grb between the cities of zhangjiakou and beijing in north china this model will maximize the aggregate net benefits of the two cities including the net benefits from water uses in agriculture industry and the municipality the different benefit claims of each player on the distribution of the initial property rights will be integrated into the model to generate noninferior solutions then the rubinstein bargaining solution will be selected to allocate the initial water rights and pollutant discharge rights for each player these solutions can be regarded as the payoffs of each player if no full basin cooperative agreement can be achieved based on the rubinstein bargaining solution as an alternative status quo point cooperative game theory concepts core and nash solutions will be used to identify stable water allocations under which both of the cities can find it beneficial to cooperate it is expected to resolve trans boundary water conflicts in a fair and efficient way through the proposed allocations methods the organization of the paper is as follows in the next section the grb is introduced the methodology of models is presented in section 3 the proposed model s implementation results are given in section 4 followed by the conclusion in section 5 2 overview of the guanting reservoir basin the guanting reservoir is located between beijing and hebei province which is approximately 80 km northwest of downtown beijing as shown in fig 1 it was constructed in 1954 and was originally operated as a major reservoir to supply drinking water in the region its total storage capacity is 4 16 billion m3 the guanting reservoir basin grb contains three tributaries including the sanggan river yang river and guishui river the first two rivers flow from west to east and then converge at the bahaoqiao river node and go into guanting reservoir these subbasins of the two rivers belong to zhangjiakou city of hebei province which includes 9 counties i e wanquan huaian zhangjiakou xuanhua chongli weixian yangyuan zhulu and huailai covering an area of 1 91 104 km2 water conflicts have been mainly occurring between zhangjiakou and beijing due to their independent jurisdictions and the share over a certain amount of water resources thus studying the basin of this research is confined to these two subbasins the study basin has a semiarid continental climate the annual average temperature is 10 1 c the average annual evaporation is approximately 1200 to 1400 mm zjkwrd 2015 the precipitation is approximately 350 to 500 mm averaging 406 mm year which is subject to uneven distribution normally 70 to 80 of the precipitation concentrates in two periods from march to april and july to september the annual runoff depth is 40 to 70 mm and the annual runoff coefficient is from 0 10 to 0 17 the monthly runoff distributions are similar to that of precipitation during the period of the 1950s to the 2000s the annual water inflow from zhangjiakou to the guanting reservoir had declined rapidly with a continuously increasing water demand mainly due to upstream agricultural water usages under climate change at the basin scale liu et al 2013 sun and han 2013 the water inflow from zhangjiakou in the 2000 s average 130 mm3 yr was approximately 1 15 of that in the 1950s average 2020 mm3 yr a public allocation system in which water is defined as public property with the state as the owner of the water and where the water rights are administratively allocated to users through water permits from local governments has been used for water resources management in the grb wang et al 2007 however water right agreements never exist among jurisdictions at trans boundary nodes which may cause trans boundary water conflicts the only constraint to the upstream is the minimum environmental flow guaranteed for the downstream in recent years and is a new management philosophy without enforcement in practice the water qualities at river nodes are regulated by china s state environmental protection agency sepa according to the regulation the planning target of the guanting reservoir is the class iii water quality standard of the chinese surface water standard i e gb3838 2002 that of the yang river and sanggan river are actually regulated as class iv chinese surface water standard i e gb3838 2002 therefore the water quality in the trans boundary node of bahaoqiao a monitoring station for grb is also class iv then the incompatible water quality standard shows that the determination of the upstream water quality does not consider the use purpose of the downstream a management policy i e measures for the protection and management of water resources in the guanting water system jointly issued by beijing and hebei provinces in 1984 has developed basic principles for the protection however it is out of date and has not been revised yet therefore it is not suitable to realize water resource protection and pollution control of the entire river basin for example it justly regulated the local government s rights for supervision and implementation of the measures but there are no other laws and institutions to restrain the local government s water use and pollutant discharge behaviors at the trans boundary node hence the existing policy and institutional framework lacks legal effectiveness which leads to the limited binding force on trans boundary water environment protection and water resources utilization from 2010 to 2015 the average water inflow from the upstream continuously decreased to 98 mm3 yr zjkwrd 2015 however beijing demands that the average water flow received from zhangjiakou should be no less than 300 mm3 yr including the minimum environmental flows of 126 mm3 yr which is calculated by the tennant method tennant 1976 at the same time the average amount of available surface water resources in the upstream is merely 666 mm3 yr but the average water demands by the upstream agriculture are at least 567 mm3 yr indicating that there is not sufficient water to simultaneously satisfy both the upstream and downstream water demands even if environmental flows are not considered moreover water conflicts have been occurring due to the declining available water resources and the deterioration of the water quality in the study area since the 1980s the water supply has become the primary task of the reservoir especially for domestic water supply to the western part of beijing because of with its poor water quality which is continually polluted by inflows from zhangjiakou the guanting reservoir has not been employed as a domestic water supply option since 1997 in addition as a result of sewage irrigation the unit output of agricultural in the upstream can be reduced by 50 at most hence the deteriorated water quality has a negative impact not only on the water supply to beijing but also on the water supply to zhangjiakou in 2015 the average total loads of chemical oxygen demands codcr to the tributary rivers was 6 70 104 tons yr causing the concentration of codcr at bahaoqiao to increase to an average of 68 mg l which is significantly worse than the required water quality standard of any use as 20 0 mg l is the concentration limit of codcr for domestic water use purposes and 40 0 mg l for agricultural water use purposes according to the chinese surface water standard i e gb3838 2002 at the same time water quality recovery goals are different for the two cities because of different water use purposes beijing prefers the upstream restored water quality to be 30 0 mg l at bahaoqiao as regulated by sepa for attempting to reuse water for domestic purposes comparatively zhangjiakou would prefer to recover water quality to 40 0 mg l for agricultural consumption because of their development rights and the very low costs of breaking the rules several reasons besides reduced precipitation caused by climate change could partially explain the increasing water conflicts in the studied area liu et al 2013 including the following a a lack of integrated water resources management iwrm abilities at the river basin scale i e the institution of the guanting reservoir basin management does not have the authority to coordinate the conflicts of the different targets and the profits between zhangjiakou and beijing b water quantity and quality are separately managed by two different administrative institutions in china specifically the ministry of water resources mwr and its local branches are responsible for water allocation flood control and construction and management of water conservancy projects water quality and pollutant control are the major responsibilities of china s state environmental protection agency sepa and its local branches until now there have been no institutional frameworks or mechanisms to reach consensus among these two management authorities these independent policies and their implementation activities could destroy the integrity of the ecosystems and the socio economy in the river basin c water rights and pollutant discharge rights are not clearly defined among these two jurisdictions although some laws policies and research have stipulated some principles of water use and sewage disposal there are no clear control indexes at the trans boundary nodes basically each player chooses the favorable principles for distribution which aggravates the unclear initial property rights gains from the status quo point are well accepted by zhangjiakou for their advantageous hydrogeography and will be regarded as the bottom line for further negotiation it is strongly rejected by beijing for the reasons of polluters should pay and maintaining the minimum environmental flows according to the new management philosophy beijing would prefer an alternative to maintain the minimum environmental flow and the recovered water quality to be lower than class iv chinese surface water standard i e gb3838 2002 cod 30 mg l as the starting point to begin cooperation and d a great economic and social development gap between the two players causes the principle of polluter should pay to not work properly for example the gross domestic product gdp per capita of zhangjiakou was 18 948 cny yr in 2010 the exchange rate of cny against the u s dollar was approximately 0 158 contrastingly that value of beijing was 68 788 cny yr in addition to the economic difference another major reason stems from beijing being the capital of china it would impair beijing s reputation if it treated the upstream unfairly 3 methodology 3 1 a general framework a general framework is illustrated in fig 2 the methodology consists of three main steps as follows constructing mathematic programming model of the grb grbm allocating initial water rights and pollutant discharge rights based on rubinstein sequential bargaining theory rsbt and reallocating water rights and pollutant discharge rights based on the cooperative game theory in the first step a water and pollutant discharge allocation optimization model of the grb is developed representing in the network form the system made of two rivers and 9 aquifers with their various consumptions i e agriculture urban center ecology this model belongs to a nonlinear programming nlp model it is designed to maximize the aggregate net benefits of the entire basin including the gross benefits form water uses in agriculture and urban functions minus the costs of water supply and pollutant treatments subject to constraints of water balance and water qualities at a number of river nodes the environmental water supply and the bounds of water consumption at the nodes the model is helpful to analyze the water use and discharge behaviors of the players and their net benefits under different scenarios in the second step the initial water rights and pollutant discharge rights of the players are determined by negotiation the players have different reasonable claims for allocations because of unclear water rights the principle of equity which can be defined as making a certain degree of agreement or compromises on allocation based on individual net benefits claims is mainly considered during the negotiation process this negotiation process can be viewed as a rubinstein bargaining game with the rubinstein bargaining game rules integrated into the grbm the initial water rights are allocated to the two players at this stage i a noninferior solution set is generated between the two players to show all possible bargaining results through using Œµ constraint methods this set needs to change one of the objectives to a constraint and the model is repeatedly solved by the variable constraint value miettinen 1999 and ii the rubinstein bargaining solution i e to select a compromise point in a noninferior solution set can be seen as a sequential bargaining process with a strategic approach rubinstein 1982 in the third step the possible cooperative coalitions among players are formed and cooperative net benefits or the characteristic functions for each coalition are calculated through optimal reallocation of each player s water use and pollutant discharge rights based on cooperative solution concepts the water use and discharge rights of players are reallocated as final allocations at this stage the principle of economic efficiency is mainly considered during the process of optimal allocation the main contents are as follows i generating a core solution set i e a core solution should meet the three conditions of feasibility pareto optimality and individual rationality becker and easter 1997 ii using the nash solution to obtain cooperative schemes nash 1950 1953 raquel et al 2007 i e generally three alternative solutions such as the nucleolus shapley value and nash solution may be used to achieve an agreement from a set of core solutions all of these methods except the nash solution are based on a set of characteristic functions representing partial and grand coalitions which are suitable for analyzing the impacts of partial coalitions to the distribution of the grand coalition though partial coalition scenarios between 2 players have been proposed by bhagabati et al 2017 they are neglected with the players either fully cooperating or not cooperating at all in this paper therefore the nash solution is used to equitably allocate utility gains to each player in this study of which cooperative benefit allocations depend on the distance in utility for each player from its disagreement position 3 2 spatial structure of the grb model grbm the grbm includes demand and supply nodes fig 3 there are two types of demand nodes surface water demand and groundwater demand and two types of supply nodes surface water supply and groundwater supply the urban water demands within the gbr including domestic water use and industrial water use are mainly supplied by groundwater except in beijing the agricultural water usage within the gbr mainly comes from surface water hence every county besides beijing has two demand nodes one for agricultural water demand and the other for urban water demand and two supply nodes one for surface water supply and the other for groundwater supply out of the 18 grbm supply nodes zhangjiakou city has 17 supply nodes including 8 surface water supply nodes in which wanquan and huaian county share a node and 9 groundwater supply nodes bahaoqiao as neither a supply node nor a demand node represents the trans boundary controlsection where water inflows enter into the guanting reservoir and it is assumed that all inflows from it can be used for beijing beijing city has only one surface water supply node j 9 guanting reservoir among the 19 demand nodes 10 are for urban uses and 9 are for agricultural uses zhangjiakou has 18 demand nodes including 9 surface water demand nodes and 9 groundwater demand nodes and beijing has only one surface water demand node i 10 3 3 development of a mathematical programming model a number of simplifications of hydrological systems are undertaken before modeling including the following 1 though the guanting reservoir has the ability to adjust the annual runoff the optimal operation of the reservoir to meet multiple water demands in beijing is beyond the scope of this paper within any trans jurisdictional water conflicts beijing mainly cares about the water quantity and quality from zhangjiakou at the bahaoqiao node hence all inflows at bahaoqiao are supposed to be used as domestic water by beijing other reservoirs in this area are small ones without the abilities to adjust annual runoffs their functions are similar to simple nodes 2 the length and number of time steps for solving the model are set as 12 months and 12 time steps respectively the average monthly runoff at the river nodes and the average groundwater resources of the relevant aquifers are used as hydrological data inputs monthly fluctuations of water uses and pollutant discharges are considered in the models for the statistics of water demands of the counties based on a monthly time step though extreme conditions such as droughts or floods are not considered in the model the kernels of the method and solution are not changed thus the proposed method can be operated through imputing new data nevertheless these limitations in the model need to be improved in the further research with the above simplifications the net benefits of the grbm the objective function can be defined as follows 1 neb t 1 t agr v a l a g wt i j a g r a g r s c w j i agr

1 e x p Œ≤ i 2 Œ∑ i a g r p g w t i here an exponential function is supposed to be the relationship between the costs and the amount of pollutant removal wang and wang 2013 then the total pollutant

total value of the water at i is v a l u r wt i and the total value of the water to all urban nodes is urb v a l u r wt i then the water supply cost of obtaining water at node i is urbsc w j i and the total water supply cost to all urban nodes is j u r b u r b s c w j i if urbpg is the pollutants generated by unit urban water consumption Œ∑ i is the pollutant removal rates then the amount of

the total pollutant removal costs to all urban nodes is urb Œ≤ i 3 e x p Œ≤ i 4 Œ∑ i u b r p g w t i hence the net benefit of water usage to urban is as follows 11 urb v a l u r wt i j u r b u r b s c

upstream withdrawals rfr i j wt i and the water from the upstream nodes l to j l uq l j the total input at node j is as follows 12 i rfr i j wt i tf j l uq l j on the other hand water leaving node j is allocated to reservoir evaporation rel j water withdrawal for agricultural uses w j i transformation of surface water into groundwater at node j stg j and water released to downstream node dq j then the total amount of water leaving the node is as follows 13 i w j i dq j rel j stg j combining eqs 12 13 leads to the water balance constraint at node j j s u r eq 3 in eq 4 the water supply from node j to urban demand node i w j i j g r o cannot exceed the available groundwater resources at node j gw j in eq 5 dq j is the total water flowing out of node j j s u r towards the downstream node which should exceed the minimum environmental flow to sustain the river ecological system the parameter size i is a measure of the size of the demand node either urban or agriculture and minagr m a x a g r m i n u r b m a x u r b represent the minimum usage rates to sustain agricultural and urban activities and the maximum usage rates to prevent excessive withdrawal hence the upper and lower limits of total water consumption at node i wt i are constrained by eq 6 generally the cost of pollutant removal increases exponentially with the increase of the removal rate especially the last percentages wang and wang 2013 equation 7 means that the pollutant removal rate cannot increase unrestrainedly for ensuring economic efficiency according to the one dimensional water quality model at river nodes wang et al 2013 we can calculate the concentration value of a pollutant at node j as follows 14 c j dq l c l a g r p c wt i 1 Œ∑ i u r b p c wt k 1 Œ∑ k dq j e x p k j x l j u l j l j s u

j c j dq j e x p k j x l j u l j c l dq l if agrpc wt i 1 Œ∑ i is the amount of agricultural nonpoint pollutant discharged into the river after treatments of best management practices and urbpc wt k 1 Œ∑ k is the amount of urban point pollutant discharged into the river after the treatments of centralized treatment plants then the total pollutant discharged into node j j s u r is as follows 16 agrpc wt i 1 Œ∑ i u r b p c wt k 1 Œ∑ k the concentration of pollutant at node j j s u r is as follows 17 rc j a g r p c wt i 1 Œ∑ i u r b p c wt k 1 Œ∑ k hence combining eqs 14 17 leads to eq 8 any concentration of pollutant at node j determined by eq 8 should lower than the target value set by the player which leads to eq 9 the procedures for estimating the model input parameters are fully described in the appendix all parameter values used by the model are presented in table 2 of the appendix materials the real coded genetic algorithm based optimization tool of matlabr2014b was used for solving the developed nonlinear optimization model whereas eqs 1 and 8 are nonlinear functions the genetic algorithm is a method for solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems that are based on natural selection the process that drives biological evolution it can be applied to solve an optimization problem in which the objective functions and constraints are highly nonlinear dandy and engelhardt 2001 liu et al 2010 sadati et al 2014 many operating parameters for the genetic algorithm should be set before running such as the fitness function the number of variables initial population and stopping conditions for the algorithm when using the genetic algorithm the population type can be set as double vectors i e real coded ga and the population size can be set as 200 the crossover fraction and mutation rate are set as 0 8 and 0 01 respectively the default value 10 6 in the genetic algorithm solver was used in the function tolerance as a stopping criterion which can satisfy the solution precision of optimization in this paper the running time of one calculation is approximately 75 s the maximum number of iterations that the genetic algorithm performs is 10 800 3 4 initial allocation we assume that the allocation of initial water rights is carried out by negotiation where the players discuss their strategies but without side payments and under the threat of independent payoffs if no agreement is achieved equality is the primary consideration that is each player s benefit claims need to be equitably considered and a distribution result is obtained by compromise and negotiation among the players the established grbm is appropriately adjusted to reflect the benefit outputs of the different strategies adopted by the players the derived benefits are defined as follows neb z n is the net economic benefit of zhangjiakou city under strategy n n e b b n is the net economic benefit of beijing city under strategy n the lower bound of the adopted strategy by zhangjiakou is the actual water use and pollutant discharges at the status quo year and the derived net benefits neb z m i n can be directly calculated according to eq 1 due to unclear water use and pollutant discharge rights between the players debates over whether all allocations of status quo should be chosen as a start point of the cooperative game is a problem it is preferred by zhangjiakou but not by beijing beijing may argue that zhangjiakou should release more outflows than that of the status quo by additionally considering the minimum environmental flows and recovery from the status quo water quality to regulated water quality at the bahaoqiao node with beijing s alternative beijing s minimum accepted net benefits can be presented as neb b m i n and can be acquired through calculating eq 1 with the constraints of preferred water quantity and quality indexes at the bahaoqiao node after neb z m i n and neb b m i n have been calculated we begin to identify the upper bound of the strategies for both players neb z m a x and neb b m a x the neb z m a x can be achieved through solving eqs 1 9 and 18 an adding constraint of beijing s strategy no less than neb b m i n which can be presented as follows j constraint of beijing s strategy 18 neb b neb b m i n similarly neb b m a x can be achieved to solve eqs 1 9 and 19 an added constraint of zhangjiakou s strategy no less than neb z m i n which can be presented as follows k constraint of zhangjiakou s strategy 19 neb z neb z m i n therefore the strategic spaces for zhangjiakou are str z neb z m i n neb z m a x additionally for the player of beijing the strategic spaces are str b neb b m i n neb b m a x once the strategy ranges of the two players are determined we can repeatedly solve eqs 1 9 by using the Œµ constraint method to generate noninferior solution sets between zhangjiakou and beijing whereas the net economic benefit of beijing is changed as a constraint and its value is repeatedly changed from neb b m i n to neb b m a x with an interval i e Œ¥ 1 0 10 8 cny yr this noninferior solution set illustrates how the players net benefits change with the selected strategies of each other and reflects the conflict of interest of the two involved players along with the noninferior solution set the two players are bargaining regarding which alternative should be adopted as a compromise solution it is usually difficult to choose an alternative from a set of alternatives if they are nondominated in this paper for selecting a compromise solution among the set of noninferior solutions we utilized the method of the two player rubinstein bargaining game which could simulate a somewhat realistic negotiation process sutton 1986 myerson 1991 kerachian et al 2010 the main process of the rubinstein bargaining game can be illustrated through a simple example assume that two players set out to divide one unit of money between them the players take turns making proposals at first player one proposes his share player two can either accept or reject the proposed share when player two accepts the proposal the game ends and the money is allocated according to the proposed share however if player two rejects player one s proposal he would be able to suggest a new share similarly the game ends if player one accepts the sharing rule if he rejects the proposal he could again suggest a new share the rubinstein bargaining solution could consider a discounting effect of the money which means that the present value of the money will decrease with increased bargaining rounds this provides a motive for the players to reach a quick agreement such a bargaining process was analyzed by rubinstein 1982 and binmore et al 1986 consider the alternating offers bargaining game with m stages as described before the game would end when the involved players accept a division neb z m neb b m in period m or obtain the outcome neb z m i n neb b m i n over the events of a breakdown of the bargaining process which means the status quo i e no loss no gain positions of the two players the preferences of the players can be defined as follows binmore et al 1986 20 œÄ z neb z m Œ¥ z m u z neb z m a n d œÄ b neb b m Œ¥ b m u b neb b m where œÄ k and Œ¥ k m are player k s preference and discount factors at m stage respectively the discount factor Œ¥ k m 0 1 can be considered as the patience of player k while u k presents the utility function of player k we assume that the utility functions of the players can be replaced by his her corresponding net benefits as follows 21 u k neb k m neb k m k z h a n g j i a k o u o r b e i j i n g additionally binmore et al 1986 proved that the optimal point neb z m neb b m of the mentioned bilateral bargaining can be achieved by maximizing the following nonlinear optimization problem 22 max z neb z m neb z m i n Œ± neb b m neb b m i n Œ≤ subject to 23 l n e b z m neb b m n e b where neb is the total net benefits of the grbm Œ± ln Œ¥ b m ln Œ¥ z m l n Œ¥ b m and Œ≤ 1 Œ± here Œ¥ b m is supposed to be equal to Œ¥ z m then eq 22 is presented as follows 24 max z neb z m neb z m i n 0 5 neb b m neb b m i n 0 5 the above equations can be solved according to the karush kuhn tucker kkt conditions kuhn and tucker 1951 3 5 reallocation by cooperative games a cooperative game cg indicates that stakeholders would prefer to form coalitions to utilize the resources available within their territories jointly and optimally for obtaining increased benefits coalitions can be classified as a subcoalition of one player a subcoalition and a grand coalition in this case study there are 2 players to form 3 coalitions which are two subcoalitions of one player and the grand coalition of the two players in the characteristic functions of a cooperative game the worth of each member can be regarded as neb z m i n and neb b m i n the net benefits of grand coalition neb tot equaling to neb will be achieved by solving equations 1 9 two solution conceptions of the cooperative game are discussed as follows 1 core solution in terms of mathematical programming the core is said to exist if both neb z and neb b can be maximized subject to equations 23 and 26 the core does not always exist that is there may be no distribution of gains that are satisfying the group rationality if the core is empty then a benefit subsidy from outside should be added to obtain a sustainable allocation if the core is not empty and is made of an infinite number of feasible allocations then all allocations within the core set can be achieved by solving the linear program lp consisting of eqs 23 and 25 26 as follows 25 max neb tot neb z neb b ‚Ö∞ feasibility and pareto optimality presented by equation 23 ‚Ö± group rationality neb z neb z m i n and neb b neb b m i n 26 2 nash solution the nash solution can be expressed as follows 27 max t n e b neb z neb z m i n neb b neb b m i n i subject to feasibility and pareto optimality eq 23 equations 23 and 27 can be solved by kkt conditions that are similar to solving the rubinstein bargaining model 4 results and discussions 4 1 optimization results of grbm application table 1 presents the total optimization benefits total water use and total pollutant discharge for zhangjiakou and beijing and the water quantity quality at the trans boundary node under the status quo initial allocation and reallocation scenarios under the status quo scenario the total net benefits of the entire basin would merely be 6 11 10 8 cny yr the net benefits of beijing are negative because of the high costs of sewage treatment zhangjiakou obtains 10 70 10 8 cny yr net benefits deriving most of its benefits 72 6 from urban water usages zhangjiakou s total water withdrawals and total codcr discharges make up almost 89 4 and 100 of the whole basin respectively whereas the pollutant discharges of beijing account for zero because of leaving the system neb of agriculture 2 93 10 8 c n y y r constitutes 27 4 of the overall gains of zhangjiakou but make up almost 68 7 of the total water use and approximately 31 3 of the total cod discharges the water released to the beijing is merely 98 1 m m 3 y r which is less than the minimum environmental inflows 126 3 m m 3 y r at the trans boundary node and the water quality is 68 mg l for codcr which is less than class v according to the chinese surface water standard i e gb3838 2002 the net benefits of the total basin of the initial allocation are improved to 17 53 10 8 cny yr contrasting to that of the status quo where nebb and nebz have been increased by 237 9 and 4 7 respectively therefore it can be inferred that the initial allocation may be easily accepted by both players because the net benefits of both players are better than the gains from the status quo the net benefits of agricultural water use in zhangjiakou are increased by 6 37 10 8 c n y y r f or the optimization of water use efficiencies however those of urban water use are decreased by 4 83 10 8 cny yr for the increased pollution reduction cost the total water usages of zhangjiakou would slightly decrease from 826 4 m m 3 y r to 796 3 m m 3 y r the amount of pollutant discharges are limited to 30 653 3 t o n y r and water quality in the trans boundary node is improved to 35 mg l the total net benefit of reallocation is 23 21 10 8 c n y y r which is much better than those of the initial allocation or status quo illustrating that the total net benefits of the basin will be greatly increased with certain cooperation the net benefits of zhangjiakou and beijing after side payments are 14 42 108 8 79 108 cny yr respectively in contrast to the initial allocation the upstream and downstream have been increased by 28 7 and 38 9 respectively however as shown in table 1 under the grand coalition the net benefit of zhangjiakou would decrease to 7 39 108 cny yr before side payment which is less than the initial allocation i e 11 20 108 cny yr it can be inferred that the reallocations cannot be automatically occurring for violating the individual rationality to realize a cooperative solution it is necessary to provide upstream side payments by the downstream or the outsider this actually happened in this case from 2010 the central government provided the upstream 5 0 108 cny yr to remove pollutants and to develop water saving agriculture under the reallocation scenario the total water usage of zhangjiakou is decreased by 601 4 m m 3 y r which is a decrease by 27 2 of water use under the initial allocations comparatively that of beijing has been increased by 316 7 m m 3 y r satisfying the city s average demands the allowed pollutant discharge of zhangjiakou city is limited to 16 926 2 t o n y r which is decreased by 44 8 in contrast to that of the initial allocation and consequently water quality can be improved to 20 mg l from the above discussion we observe that a being evaluated from the perspective of maximizing the net economic benefit reallocation is the best scheme followed by the initial distribution and the status quo is the worst and b if no side payment occurs the initial allocation would be the final outcome otherwise reallocation is supposed to be the final outcome and c the initial allocation is more stable than reallocation because of its compatible incentive 4 2 no inferior sets vs core sets and rubinstein bargaining vs nash solution fig 4 presents solution concepts of initial allocations and reallocations no inferior sets and rubinstein bargaining belong to the solutions of initial allocations comparatively core sets and the nash solution belong to solutions of reallocation as shown in fig 4 the noninferior solutions of net benefit allocations among the two players under the initial allocation scenario are the segmented curve bz the feasible strategies of beijing start from point b and end in point z along the curve with their values being changed from 4 24 108 to 8 41 108 cny yr and the feasible strategies of zhangjiakou begin at z and finish at b and their values change from 10 69 108 to 11 30 108 cny yr the main advantage of the noninferior solution curve is that each player can better understand how the strategies chosen would affect his her or other people s gains or losses and vice versa theoretically every point in bz is a feasible outcome of the initial allocations however zhangjiakou prefers the outcome of b or close to b while beijing prefers the outcome of z or close to z the final allocations depend on the bargaining power of the two players which are related to multiple factors such as outside alternatives when they fail to come to an agreement the discount rate and the patience of the players the two players will begin a series of rounds of bargaining and concession for example during the first bargaining round zhangjiakou provides his her first offer very close to his her maximum net benefits i e 11 30 108 cny yr and the corresponding value of beijing is very close to 4 24 108 cny yr as being expected beijing would not be satisfied with the results consequently he she will propose an alternative offer very close to his her maximum net benefits 8 41 108 cny yr and similarly it is rejected by zhangjiakou hence neither player would be satisfied with the results after the second round of negotiations a series of concessions and bargaining would be conducted to find a convergence the total process begins at points b and z and then as the bargaining process continues their proposed offers gradually move to point o as shown by the lines in fig 4 hence the point o is called as rubinstein bargaining solution the net benefit values of point o are 6 34 108 and 11 30 108 cny yr for beijing and zhangjiakou respectively which are also the results of the initial allocation the core solutions with the side payment under the reallocation scenario can be presented as the segmental line from point c1 to c2 in fig 4 the net benefit ranges of beijing and zhangjiakou within the core set are 4 24 108 12 52 108 cny yr and 10 69 108 18 97 108 cny yr respectively which illustrate that the core solutions weakly dominate the corresponding noninferior solutions therefore it can be inferred that the net benefits of the whole basin under reallocation can be improved relative to that of the initial allocations the net benefits of beijing and zhangjiakou in the nash solution would be 8 79 10 8 14 44 10 8 cny yr as point p showed in fig 4 and these benefits are better than the rubinstein bargaining solution point o for both players 4 3 influence of unclear initial water rights on allocations as shown in fig 4 the net benefits of the status quo point s are 4 59 108 and 10 70 108 cny yr for beijing and zhangjiakou respectively the status quo is usually treated as a starting point to begin cooperation or as a starting point to allocate incremental benefits however this status quo point usually benefits the upstream due to its favorable geographical position of hydrology the net benefits achieved from the status quo are not acceptable for beijing in this case according to beijing s views of initial water rights any net benefits assigned to him her less than 4 24 108 cny yr would be rejected by beijing these above two different views of water rights result in a new virtual starting point e 4 24 108 cny yr for beijing and 10 69 108 cny yr for zhangjiakou in fig 4 and thus form the strategy space bz or zb on the basis of it in contrast to the status quo unclear initial water rights result in narrowing strategy choices of the players during negotiation as any offer should simultaneously satisfy both players minimum net benefits determined by point e the narrowness of the strategy range may help the players feel more comfortable in making a difficult decision hence it could help the players quickly reach an agreement it should be pointed out that there not always exist overlaps of the strategies of the players do not always exist for example when the minimum objective value of zhangjiakou changed from points z to b and that of beijing changed from points b to z there would be no overlapping strategy space but the rubinstein bargaining solution is still effective 4 4 distribution of optimization results within a year figs 5a 5b present the monthly water usages of zhangjiakou and beijing under the initial allocation and reallocation scenarios among them fig 5a illustrates the monthly water usage of zhangjiakou it is easily found that the water consumptions of upstream both have two water use peaks under the two scenarios mainly occurring from april to august and from december to january which are the peak periods of agricultural water consumption and would account for approximately 84 5 and 87 7 of the annual total water use respectively the main difference between these two scenarios is that the water usages in reallocation during these months have been significantly reduced for being transferred to downstream water usages compared to that of initial allocations in fig 5b the monthly water consumptions of beijing are present the monthly water consumption values of beijing under the two scenarios are both relatively stable fig 6 presents the allowed pollutant discharges under the two scenarios initial allocation and reallocation the allowed pollutant discharges are small from november to february and may for low flows during the dry seasons and this trend is similar to the distribution of monthly water inflows under the initial allocation the allowed pollutant discharges from agriculture are much larger than that from urban use that means that municipal sewage is treated first when the pollution reduction rate is low as the urban pollutants reduction rate is high agricultural pollutant began to be treated to further improve the water quality under the reallocation scenario in fig 7 the monthly water inflows at the trans boundary node bahaoqiao are presented water inflows from december to january and from april to august under the reallocation scenario have been greatly increased relative to that of the initial allocations the cause of this phenomenon is the conversion of the upstream agricultural water to the downstream urban water use monthly concentrations of codcr at the trans boundary node are uniformly distributed and stable with 35 and 20 mg l under the initial allocation and reallocation respectively because they are constraints of the grbm 4 5 policy implication to deal with the increasingly serious water crisis in the river basin the chinese government has introduced some new water management systems in recent years such as the strictest water resources management system swrms that was proposed in 2009 sc 2012 and river chief system rcs in 2016 gocpccc and gosc 2016 swrms is symbolically dubbed three red lines representing a policy of 1 control of development and utilization of water resources 2 control of water use efficiency and 3 restriction of pollutants in water function areas sc 2012 rcs is a national river management policy that will cover every river and lake in the country by the end of 2018 it is classified into the four following levels provincial municipal county and township level additionally the corresponding head of the local governments at each level act as the river chief who take responsibility for managing and protecting the rivers and lakes major tasks will include water resource protection management and protection of riverbanks and lakeshores water pollution prevention and control ecological restoration and law enforcement supervision gocpccc and gosc 2016 in practice swrms and rcs are integrated into a whole system their performances will be evaluated based on the assessment system of swrms which includes quotas of total water use water efficiency and the rate of reaching the water standard of water function areas mwr and mep 2016 the advantages of swrms and rcs include the following 1 policy implementation has been strengthened with quantitative assessment of the performances of the chief executive of all levels of government 2 the power to manage water is highly concentrated alleviating the phenomenon of departmental conflicts caused by the fragmented management of water resources to a certain extent within the jurisdiction of administrative regions zuo et al 2014 wang et al 2017 however there are still gaps in the management of river basins across administrative regions it is mainly embodied at the two following aspects first there is no scientific method for determining the total water use quota and pollution discharge quota of each jurisdiction the used quotas come from water resource and water pollution controlling plans from the national to county level and these plans are unscientific unsystematic and impacted by many subjective factors of the decision makers zuo and li 2013 this mandatory order obedience and a top down method may ignore the benefit claims of stakeholders the rewards and costs of abiding by the orders are too low to constrain stakeholder behavior and an incentive compatibility mechanism has not yet been formed wang and cai 2011 ren 2015 the actual implementation often lacks the support of legal and policy tools at trans boundary river sections thus it is difficult to coordinate the benefit conflict between upstream and downstream and trans boundary water conflicts in the river basins of china are still problems since the conflicts of interest between the trans jurisdictions have not been fully discussed in swrms and rcs the analytic approach used in this article may assist the governments of trans boundary watersheds to communicate with each other understand the consequences of each other s strategy choices and develop schemes to allocate water use and pollutant discharge in an equal and efficient way to be specific in step 1 of the proposed methodology the main players should participate in the establishment of a water resources distribution model in the river basin sharing the data and knowledge and fostering a cooperative atmosphere in step 2 the method can be used as a negotiation support tool to determine the quotas of each jurisdiction within a trans boundary river basin in which the interests of each jurisdiction are fairly considered in step 3 the method and results can be used to facilitate water right trading and pollutant emissions trading among players and this facilitation is the future direction of swrms and rcs upgrading 5 conclusions to overcome the limitations of using conventional game theory methods in solving complicated trans jurisdiction water conflicts a hybrid game theory and mathematical programming model hgt mpm was advanced for solving trans boundary water conflicts at the watershed scale cooperative games with and without side payment were proposed and optimization was performed although cooperation with side payment is the ideal allocating results in that it promises the highest total net benefit it is difficult to achieve such cooperation in the studied river basin because few players especially downstream are willing to provide side payment because of unclear water rights it is more realistic that stakeholders define the initial water rights by cooperation without side payment at the first stage then the initial water rights can be upgraded to reallocation of water rights by cooperation with side payment at the second stage which is also called water right trading this method represented improvements upon the previous studies in a pursuing fair and efficient water resources and pollution discharge allocation among competing users at the basin scale taking into account unclear initial water rights and water quality issues b and proposing initial water and pollution discharge permit allocation based on the rubinstein bargaining theory and subsequent water and pollution discharge permits and net benefits reallocation based on cooperative game theory the developed model was then applied to solve trans boundary water conflicts in the guanting reservoir basin of north china in the case study the proposed model was successfully used to solve the water quantity and quality conflicts among jurisdictions under the context of unclear initial water rights the proposed hybrid method has explored water resources pollution discharge permits and benefits allocation among players under both a cooperative game with and without side payment providing the two following solutions rubinstein bargaining solution and nash solution the results of the case study show that extra economic benefits could be achieved through optimizing the combination demands of water quantity and quality for the two involved jurisdictions it is indicated that unclear initial water rights and pollution discharge permit rights would result in narrowing the strategy choice of players along no inferior sets during negotiation rubinstein bargaining solutions were recommended as the starting point to cooperation rather than those of the status quo in contrast to the gains under the status quo the net benefits of all players can be improved even if no side payment occurs especially for beijing though the benefits of all players can be improved from the status quo without side payment cooperative strategies with side payment from downstream or the central government to upstream provide the players with the maximum benefits without side payment the equilibrium results of the games of the studied basin would be performed as a rubinstein bargaining game the analytic approach and results are benefits for policy makers to share understand cooperate and develop schemes for conflict resolution the rubinstein bargaining solution can be applied as initial water right and pollutant discharge right allocation among zhangjiakou and beijing it is convenient to meet the needs of decision makers and their views on the initial allocation of water right by adding or reducing constraints in the water allocating model it is a useful complement of swrms as control indicators of the trans boundary river section the method and results of the nash solution can be used to facilitate water rights trading and pollutant emissions trading among the players and this facilitation is the future direction of swrs and rcs upgrading however the proposed methods were confined to two person games in the studied area the continuing research could be extended to multiperson games in this paper the nash solution as an approximation to the equilibria of rubinstein s alternating offers bargaining model proposed by binmore et al 1986 has been employed to solve the model although the relationship between cooperative and noncooperative approaches to bargaining are well understood for the case of two players it is a much more difficult problem for the two person nash solution to the n person as an extension of n person bargaining where the subgame perfect equilibrium spe outcome would be complicated and might not be unique depending on the negotiation protocol and the discount factor rate okazaki 1993 okada 1996 suh and wen 2006 torstensson 2009 fortunately britz et al 2010 proposed that in the limit as the exogenous risk of breakdown goes to zero stationary subgame perfect equilibrium payoffs converge to the weighted nash bargaining solution with the stationary distribution of the markov process as the weight vector of which the solution can be achieved by the traditional optimization algorithms or intelligent optimization algorithms for more details about the n person bargaining game and its application to water conflict resolution please see the related literatures chae yang 1994 kerachian et al 2010 attanasi et al 2015 ghodsi et al 2016 as the two person cooperative game was extended to n person more concepts of solutions besides the n person nash solution can be select to discuss and compare the equality and stability of the solution results mehrparvar et al 2016 shi et al 2016 additionally coalition analysis is another key point to solve complicated conflicts with more players detailed theoretical and case studies of n person cooperative game applications can be seen in kucukmehmetoglu and guldmann 2004 kucukmehmetoglu et al 2010 in addition certain simplifications and limits of the models included the scarce consideration of hydrological changes and reservoir operations these limits need further research to improve the modeling accuracy and to reflect the effectiveness of real water systems acknowledgments this work was supported by the national key research program of

6731,in this research a hybrid game theory and mathematical programming model hgt mpm is proposed for solving trans boundary water conflicts in guanting reservoir basin grb between two cities i e zhangjiakou and beijing in north china a water allocation model which considers both water quality and quantity is developed for optimizing water use and pollutant discharge in the two cities maximizing the net aggregate benefits from these activities and reducing the costs for water supply and pollution removal the initial rights of water use and pollutant discharge are allocated to the cities of beijing and zhangjiakou as two players based on the incorporation of a negotiation method for ill defined water rights within the watershed at this stage equal treatment of every player s benefit claim can be addressed the strategy spaces of the two players are delineated through solving the proposed hgt mpm with mutual benefit claim constraints the rubinstein bargaining solution method is employed to identify the equilibrium of bargaining to achieve maximal benefits for the two players starting from allocating the results of the second step the concepts of core and nash solutions of cooperative games are used to generate stable basin wide cooperative solutions both players find it beneficial to cooperate with side payment from the downstream to upstream at this stage the principle of maximum economic benefits is mainly considered the results indicate that unclear initial water rights and pollutant discharge rights can be fairly defined through bilateral negotiations between upstream and downstream without side payment the initial water rights and pollutant discharge allocation will be the final outcome which is suboptimal although it is better than the status quo in term of both total and individual benefits full cooperation with side payment leads to the greatest total net benefits and the greatest benefits to each individual city the results not only provide a basis to allocate trans jurisdictional water rights and pollutant discharge rights in an equal and efficient way but also provide certain inspirations for management policy improvement such as establishing a water right trading system keywords trans boundary water conflict water quantity and quality game theory mathematical programming guanting reservoir basin grb china 1 introduction along with population growth and industrial expansion intensive conflicts over limited water resources are occurring in many countries across the world cai et al 2011 dong et al 2014 decision makers in these countries are facing multiple pressures such as promoting economic development conserving water resources and protecting the environment the induced water conflicts are associated with a variety of socioeconomic political and environmental issues forcing decision makers to contemplate comprehensive strategies among multiple water users yang et al 2008 zeng et al 2017 these water conflicts may be further multiplied by worsening water quality and unclear initial water rights that are associated with jurisdictions within specific basins thus efficient water management requires collaborations among authorities and stakeholders to utilize the limited water resources in a sustainable manner sandoval solis et al 2013 therefore effective tools that can support decision making under conflicts for allocations of water rights and pollutant discharge quotas within river basins are needed in the past decades to deal with trans boundary water conflicts at the basin scale many studies were conducted through the adoption of multiobjective programming mop methods to identify the corresponding water allocating schemes among multiple stakeholders cohon 1978 xevi and khan 2005 roozbahani et al 2014 cai et al 2009a b tan et al 2011 these studies can be generally categorized into two groups haimes and hall 1974 cohon 1978 cai et al 2004 including a methods that can generate noninferior solution sets kucukmehmetoglu and guldmann 2010 roozbahani et al 2014 and b methods that can incorporate multiobjective trade off preferences to identify desired decision alternatives han et al 2011 an important issue of using multiobjective analyses in identifying solutions for solving water conflicts is to represent competing objectives clearly and unambiguously thus they can be understandable and acceptable to the involved parties cai et al 2004 zeng et al 2017 comparatively game theory was used for coordinating trans boundary water conflicts during the settlement of competitive situations induced by the degradation of any shared water resources parrachino et al 2005 madani 2010 bhagabati et al 2014 degefu et al 2016 the concepts of game theory such as noncooperative ones which could consider strategic interactions among stakeholders and any determined agreements disagreements through the maximization of stakeholders payoffs were used to deal with trans boundary water conflict management due to its advantages of self enforcement stability and social acceptability rogers 1969 carraro et al 2007 li et al 2016 madani and hipel 2011 additionally a number of studies regarding cooperative game theory concluded that basin wide cooperation is able to produce higher benefits than individual actions rogers 1993 beeker and easter 1995 1997 wang et al 2003 wang et al 2008a b wu and whittington 2006 teasley and mckinney 2011 liao and hannam 2013 bhagabati et al 2017 islam and susskind 2018 cooperative solutions which mainly focused on having a binding agreement among the players and thus could be used for equitably allocating cooperative benefits were well developed dinar and hogarth 2015 lee 2012 cooperative solutions have been used more frequently than noncooperative game theory because the former can achieve pareto optimal outcomes peters 2008 madani 2010 more recently many mop and mathematical programming models were integrated into a general game theory framework to effectively illustrate and tackle trade offs among relevant stakeholders fallah mehdipour et al 2011 kucukmehmetoglu 2012 degefu et al 2017 kyriazi et al 2017 fu et al 2018a b however the proposed methods did not consider water quality issues when optimizing water allocations among relevant stakeholders due to the many environmental factors inherited in trans boundary water conflicts integrated water quality and quantity allocation methods kerachian and karamouz 2007 bazargan lari et al 2009 mahjouri and ardestani 2010 wei et al 2010 wang et al 2013 were developed to deal with such complexities another problem in cooperative game theory applications was the tendency to use a status quo as a starting point for the realization of benefits from cooperation dombrowsky 2010 poorsepahy samian et al 2012 here a status quo point means each player s independent payoffs if no agreement is achieved and is usually expressed as the net benefits of each player under the current situations of his her water uses and pollutant discharges moreover unclear initial property rights may make the affected stakeholders insist on an equitable distribution of property rights although great efforts have been made in applying multidisciplinary methods to deal with multiple conflicting issues in water management trans jurisdictional water conflicts in specific basins need an integrated framework that can be customized for each individual issue when using cooperative games solutions are described in terms of outcomes for coalitions then each one of the coalitions has its own characteristic function which defines the maximum value of each coalition becker and easter 1997 usually the characteristic function of a subcoalition of one player can be calculated through maximizing an individual value in turns from upstream to downstream which is called the starting point in this paper however such a calculation may cause disputes for those downstream who believe it is favoring the upstream too much especially in an ill defined water rights system instead the downstream may propose an alternative that is different from the staring point leading to different starting points and distribution results how to deal with the influence of unclear initial water rights on the allocations which will result in a starting point that is different from the status quo point is worth researching a trans jurisdictional water conflict combining water quantity and quality issues in the context of unclear initial water rights is now occurring in the guanting reservoir basin grb of north china the preliminary evaluation results of a water environmental protection plan for the grb from 2001 to 2014 li et al 2018 showed that the planning target has not yet been achieved the water quality of the guanting reservoir is inferior to the water environmental function requirements no exact evidence showed that the point source pollutant discharge has been effectively controlled li et al 2018 the previous research allocated economic benefits from cooperation that was mainly based on accepting the status quo as the starting point namely the upstream was free to use water due to the good hydrological conditions but the downstream economic social and ecological water use could not be considered yang et al 2008 however the previous allocation method may be invalid when a player rejected the status quo as his her starting point or each player would insist on his her favorable claims due to unclear water rights as a starting point to cooperation additionally they neglected the solutions if players failed in achieving cooperation with side payments to overcome these deficiencies a hybrid game theory and mathematical programming model hgt mpm will be proposed for solving trans boundary water conflicts in the guanting reservoir basin grb between the cities of zhangjiakou and beijing in north china this model will maximize the aggregate net benefits of the two cities including the net benefits from water uses in agriculture industry and the municipality the different benefit claims of each player on the distribution of the initial property rights will be integrated into the model to generate noninferior solutions then the rubinstein bargaining solution will be selected to allocate the initial water rights and pollutant discharge rights for each player these solutions can be regarded as the payoffs of each player if no full basin cooperative agreement can be achieved based on the rubinstein bargaining solution as an alternative status quo point cooperative game theory concepts core and nash solutions will be used to identify stable water allocations under which both of the cities can find it beneficial to cooperate it is expected to resolve trans boundary water conflicts in a fair and efficient way through the proposed allocations methods the organization of the paper is as follows in the next section the grb is introduced the methodology of models is presented in section 3 the proposed model s implementation results are given in section 4 followed by the conclusion in section 5 2 overview of the guanting reservoir basin the guanting reservoir is located between beijing and hebei province which is approximately 80 km northwest of downtown beijing as shown in fig 1 it was constructed in 1954 and was originally operated as a major reservoir to supply drinking water in the region its total storage capacity is 4 16 billion m3 the guanting reservoir basin grb contains three tributaries including the sanggan river yang river and guishui river the first two rivers flow from west to east and then converge at the bahaoqiao river node and go into guanting reservoir these subbasins of the two rivers belong to zhangjiakou city of hebei province which includes 9 counties i e wanquan huaian zhangjiakou xuanhua chongli weixian yangyuan zhulu and huailai covering an area of 1 91 104 km2 water conflicts have been mainly occurring between zhangjiakou and beijing due to their independent jurisdictions and the share over a certain amount of water resources thus studying the basin of this research is confined to these two subbasins the study basin has a semiarid continental climate the annual average temperature is 10 1 c the average annual evaporation is approximately 1200 to 1400 mm zjkwrd 2015 the precipitation is approximately 350 to 500 mm averaging 406 mm year which is subject to uneven distribution normally 70 to 80 of the precipitation concentrates in two periods from march to april and july to september the annual runoff depth is 40 to 70 mm and the annual runoff coefficient is from 0 10 to 0 17 the monthly runoff distributions are similar to that of precipitation during the period of the 1950s to the 2000s the annual water inflow from zhangjiakou to the guanting reservoir had declined rapidly with a continuously increasing water demand mainly due to upstream agricultural water usages under climate change at the basin scale liu et al 2013 sun and han 2013 the water inflow from zhangjiakou in the 2000 s average 130 mm3 yr was approximately 1 15 of that in the 1950s average 2020 mm3 yr a public allocation system in which water is defined as public property with the state as the owner of the water and where the water rights are administratively allocated to users through water permits from local governments has been used for water resources management in the grb wang et al 2007 however water right agreements never exist among jurisdictions at trans boundary nodes which may cause trans boundary water conflicts the only constraint to the upstream is the minimum environmental flow guaranteed for the downstream in recent years and is a new management philosophy without enforcement in practice the water qualities at river nodes are regulated by china s state environmental protection agency sepa according to the regulation the planning target of the guanting reservoir is the class iii water quality standard of the chinese surface water standard i e gb3838 2002 that of the yang river and sanggan river are actually regulated as class iv chinese surface water standard i e gb3838 2002 therefore the water quality in the trans boundary node of bahaoqiao a monitoring station for grb is also class iv then the incompatible water quality standard shows that the determination of the upstream water quality does not consider the use purpose of the downstream a management policy i e measures for the protection and management of water resources in the guanting water system jointly issued by beijing and hebei provinces in 1984 has developed basic principles for the protection however it is out of date and has not been revised yet therefore it is not suitable to realize water resource protection and pollution control of the entire river basin for example it justly regulated the local government s rights for supervision and implementation of the measures but there are no other laws and institutions to restrain the local government s water use and pollutant discharge behaviors at the trans boundary node hence the existing policy and institutional framework lacks legal effectiveness which leads to the limited binding force on trans boundary water environment protection and water resources utilization from 2010 to 2015 the average water inflow from the upstream continuously decreased to 98 mm3 yr zjkwrd 2015 however beijing demands that the average water flow received from zhangjiakou should be no less than 300 mm3 yr including the minimum environmental flows of 126 mm3 yr which is calculated by the tennant method tennant 1976 at the same time the average amount of available surface water resources in the upstream is merely 666 mm3 yr but the average water demands by the upstream agriculture are at least 567 mm3 yr indicating that there is not sufficient water to simultaneously satisfy both the upstream and downstream water demands even if environmental flows are not considered moreover water conflicts have been occurring due to the declining available water resources and the deterioration of the water quality in the study area since the 1980s the water supply has become the primary task of the reservoir especially for domestic water supply to the western part of beijing because of with its poor water quality which is continually polluted by inflows from zhangjiakou the guanting reservoir has not been employed as a domestic water supply option since 1997 in addition as a result of sewage irrigation the unit output of agricultural in the upstream can be reduced by 50 at most hence the deteriorated water quality has a negative impact not only on the water supply to beijing but also on the water supply to zhangjiakou in 2015 the average total loads of chemical oxygen demands codcr to the tributary rivers was 6 70 104 tons yr causing the concentration of codcr at bahaoqiao to increase to an average of 68 mg l which is significantly worse than the required water quality standard of any use as 20 0 mg l is the concentration limit of codcr for domestic water use purposes and 40 0 mg l for agricultural water use purposes according to the chinese surface water standard i e gb3838 2002 at the same time water quality recovery goals are different for the two cities because of different water use purposes beijing prefers the upstream restored water quality to be 30 0 mg l at bahaoqiao as regulated by sepa for attempting to reuse water for domestic purposes comparatively zhangjiakou would prefer to recover water quality to 40 0 mg l for agricultural consumption because of their development rights and the very low costs of breaking the rules several reasons besides reduced precipitation caused by climate change could partially explain the increasing water conflicts in the studied area liu et al 2013 including the following a a lack of integrated water resources management iwrm abilities at the river basin scale i e the institution of the guanting reservoir basin management does not have the authority to coordinate the conflicts of the different targets and the profits between zhangjiakou and beijing b water quantity and quality are separately managed by two different administrative institutions in china specifically the ministry of water resources mwr and its local branches are responsible for water allocation flood control and construction and management of water conservancy projects water quality and pollutant control are the major responsibilities of china s state environmental protection agency sepa and its local branches until now there have been no institutional frameworks or mechanisms to reach consensus among these two management authorities these independent policies and their implementation activities could destroy the integrity of the ecosystems and the socio economy in the river basin c water rights and pollutant discharge rights are not clearly defined among these two jurisdictions although some laws policies and research have stipulated some principles of water use and sewage disposal there are no clear control indexes at the trans boundary nodes basically each player chooses the favorable principles for distribution which aggravates the unclear initial property rights gains from the status quo point are well accepted by zhangjiakou for their advantageous hydrogeography and will be regarded as the bottom line for further negotiation it is strongly rejected by beijing for the reasons of polluters should pay and maintaining the minimum environmental flows according to the new management philosophy beijing would prefer an alternative to maintain the minimum environmental flow and the recovered water quality to be lower than class iv chinese surface water standard i e gb3838 2002 cod 30 mg l as the starting point to begin cooperation and d a great economic and social development gap between the two players causes the principle of polluter should pay to not work properly for example the gross domestic product gdp per capita of zhangjiakou was 18 948 cny yr in 2010 the exchange rate of cny against the u s dollar was approximately 0 158 contrastingly that value of beijing was 68 788 cny yr in addition to the economic difference another major reason stems from beijing being the capital of china it would impair beijing s reputation if it treated the upstream unfairly 3 methodology 3 1 a general framework a general framework is illustrated in fig 2 the methodology consists of three main steps as follows constructing mathematic programming model of the grb grbm allocating initial water rights and pollutant discharge rights based on rubinstein sequential bargaining theory rsbt and reallocating water rights and pollutant discharge rights based on the cooperative game theory in the first step a water and pollutant discharge allocation optimization model of the grb is developed representing in the network form the system made of two rivers and 9 aquifers with their various consumptions i e agriculture urban center ecology this model belongs to a nonlinear programming nlp model it is designed to maximize the aggregate net benefits of the entire basin including the gross benefits form water uses in agriculture and urban functions minus the costs of water supply and pollutant treatments subject to constraints of water balance and water qualities at a number of river nodes the environmental water supply and the bounds of water consumption at the nodes the model is helpful to analyze the water use and discharge behaviors of the players and their net benefits under different scenarios in the second step the initial water rights and pollutant discharge rights of the players are determined by negotiation the players have different reasonable claims for allocations because of unclear water rights the principle of equity which can be defined as making a certain degree of agreement or compromises on allocation based on individual net benefits claims is mainly considered during the negotiation process this negotiation process can be viewed as a rubinstein bargaining game with the rubinstein bargaining game rules integrated into the grbm the initial water rights are allocated to the two players at this stage i a noninferior solution set is generated between the two players to show all possible bargaining results through using Œµ constraint methods this set needs to change one of the objectives to a constraint and the model is repeatedly solved by the variable constraint value miettinen 1999 and ii the rubinstein bargaining solution i e to select a compromise point in a noninferior solution set can be seen as a sequential bargaining process with a strategic approach rubinstein 1982 in the third step the possible cooperative coalitions among players are formed and cooperative net benefits or the characteristic functions for each coalition are calculated through optimal reallocation of each player s water use and pollutant discharge rights based on cooperative solution concepts the water use and discharge rights of players are reallocated as final allocations at this stage the principle of economic efficiency is mainly considered during the process of optimal allocation the main contents are as follows i generating a core solution set i e a core solution should meet the three conditions of feasibility pareto optimality and individual rationality becker and easter 1997 ii using the nash solution to obtain cooperative schemes nash 1950 1953 raquel et al 2007 i e generally three alternative solutions such as the nucleolus shapley value and nash solution may be used to achieve an agreement from a set of core solutions all of these methods except the nash solution are based on a set of characteristic functions representing partial and grand coalitions which are suitable for analyzing the impacts of partial coalitions to the distribution of the grand coalition though partial coalition scenarios between 2 players have been proposed by bhagabati et al 2017 they are neglected with the players either fully cooperating or not cooperating at all in this paper therefore the nash solution is used to equitably allocate utility gains to each player in this study of which cooperative benefit allocations depend on the distance in utility for each player from its disagreement position 3 2 spatial structure of the grb model grbm the grbm includes demand and supply nodes fig 3 there are two types of demand nodes surface water demand and groundwater demand and two types of supply nodes surface water supply and groundwater supply the urban water demands within the gbr including domestic water use and industrial water use are mainly supplied by groundwater except in beijing the agricultural water usage within the gbr mainly comes from surface water hence every county besides beijing has two demand nodes one for agricultural water demand and the other for urban water demand and two supply nodes one for surface water supply and the other for groundwater supply out of the 18 grbm supply nodes zhangjiakou city has 17 supply nodes including 8 surface water supply nodes in which wanquan and huaian county share a node and 9 groundwater supply nodes bahaoqiao as neither a supply node nor a demand node represents the trans boundary controlsection where water inflows enter into the guanting reservoir and it is assumed that all inflows from it can be used for beijing beijing city has only one surface water supply node j 9 guanting reservoir among the 19 demand nodes 10 are for urban uses and 9 are for agricultural uses zhangjiakou has 18 demand nodes including 9 surface water demand nodes and 9 groundwater demand nodes and beijing has only one surface water demand node i 10 3 3 development of a mathematical programming model a number of simplifications of hydrological systems are undertaken before modeling including the following 1 though the guanting reservoir has the ability to adjust the annual runoff the optimal operation of the reservoir to meet multiple water demands in beijing is beyond the scope of this paper within any trans jurisdictional water conflicts beijing mainly cares about the water quantity and quality from zhangjiakou at the bahaoqiao node hence all inflows at bahaoqiao are supposed to be used as domestic water by beijing other reservoirs in this area are small ones without the abilities to adjust annual runoffs their functions are similar to simple nodes 2 the length and number of time steps for solving the model are set as 12 months and 12 time steps respectively the average monthly runoff at the river nodes and the average groundwater resources of the relevant aquifers are used as hydrological data inputs monthly fluctuations of water uses and pollutant discharges are considered in the models for the statistics of water demands of the counties based on a monthly time step though extreme conditions such as droughts or floods are not considered in the model the kernels of the method and solution are not changed thus the proposed method can be operated through imputing new data nevertheless these limitations in the model need to be improved in the further research with the above simplifications the net benefits of the grbm the objective function can be defined as follows 1 neb t 1 t agr v a l a g wt i j a g r a g r s c w j i agr

total water supply cost to all urban nodes is j u r b u r b s c w j i if urbpg is the pollutants generated by unit urban water consumption Œ∑ i is the pollutant removal rates then the amount of

the total pollutant removal costs to all urban nodes is urb Œ≤ i 3 e x p Œ≤ i 4 Œ∑ i u b r p g w t i hence the net benefit of water usage to urban is as follows 11 urb v a l u r wt i j u r b u r b s c

then the total amount of water leaving the node is as follows 13 i w j i dq j rel j stg j combining eqs 12 13 leads to the water balance constraint at node j j s u r eq 3 in eq 4 the water supply from node j to urban demand node i w j i j g r o cannot exceed the available groundwater resources at node j gw j in eq 5 dq j is the total water flowing out of node j j s u r towards the downstream node which should exceed the minimum environmental flow to sustain the river ecological system the parameter size i is a measure of the size of the demand node either urban or agriculture and minagr m a x a g r m i n u r b m a x u r b represent the minimum usage rates to sustain agricultural and urban activities and the maximum usage rates to prevent excessive withdrawal hence the upper and lower limits of total water consumption at node i wt i are constrained by eq 6 generally the cost of pollutant removal increases exponentially with the increase of the removal rate especially the last percentages wang and wang 2013 equation 7 means that the pollutant removal rate cannot increase unrestrainedly for ensuring economic efficiency according to the one dimensional water quality model at river nodes wang et al 2013 we can calculate the concentration value of a pollutant at node j as follows 14 c j dq l c l a g r p c wt i 1 Œ∑ i u r b p c wt k 1 Œ∑ k dq j e x p k j x l j u l j l j s u

j c j dq j e x p k j x l j u l j c l dq l if agrpc wt i 1 Œ∑ i is the amount of agricultural nonpoint pollutant discharged into the river after treatments of best management practices and urbpc wt k 1 Œ∑ k is the amount of urban point pollutant discharged into the river after the treatments of centralized treatment plants then the total pollutant discharged into node j j s u r is as follows 16 agrpc wt i 1 Œ∑ i u r b p c wt k 1 Œ∑ k the concentration of pollutant at node j j s u r is as follows 17 rc j a g r p c wt i 1 Œ∑ i u r b p c wt k 1 Œ∑ k hence combining eqs 14 17 leads to eq 8 any concentration of pollutant at node j determined by eq 8 should lower than the target value set by the player which leads to eq 9 the procedures for estimating the model input parameters are fully described in the appendix all parameter values used by the model are presented in table 2 of the appendix materials the real coded genetic algorithm based optimization tool of matlabr2014b was used for solving the developed nonlinear optimization model whereas eqs 1 and 8 are nonlinear functions the genetic algorithm is a method for solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems that are based on natural selection the process that drives biological evolution it can be applied to solve an optimization problem in which the objective functions and constraints are highly nonlinear dandy and engelhardt 2001 liu et al 2010 sadati et al 2014 many operating parameters for the genetic algorithm should be set before running such as the fitness function the number of variables initial population and stopping conditions for the algorithm when using the genetic algorithm the population type can be set as double vectors i e real coded ga and the population size can be set as 200 the crossover fraction and mutation rate are set as 0 8 and 0 01 respectively the default value 10 6 in the genetic algorithm solver was used in the function tolerance as a stopping criterion which can satisfy the solution precision of optimization in this paper the running time of one calculation is approximately 75 s the maximum number of iterations that the genetic algorithm performs is 10 800 3 4 initial allocation we assume that the allocation of initial water rights is carried out by negotiation where the players discuss their strategies but without side payments and under the threat of independent payoffs if no agreement is achieved equality is the primary consideration that is each player s benefit claims need to be equitably considered and a distribution result is obtained by compromise and negotiation among the players the established grbm is appropriately adjusted to reflect the benefit outputs of the different strategies adopted by the players the derived benefits are defined as follows neb z n is the net economic benefit of zhangjiakou city under strategy n n e b b n is the net economic benefit of beijing city under strategy n the lower bound of the adopted strategy by zhangjiakou is the actual water use and pollutant discharges at the status quo year and the derived net benefits neb z m i n can be directly calculated according to eq 1 due to unclear water use and pollutant discharge rights between the players debates over whether all allocations of status quo should be chosen as a start point of the cooperative game is a problem it is preferred by zhangjiakou but not by beijing beijing may argue that zhangjiakou should release more outflows than that of the status quo by additionally considering the minimum environmental flows and recovery from the status quo water quality to regulated water quality at the bahaoqiao node with beijing s alternative beijing s minimum accepted net benefits can be presented as neb b m i n and can be acquired through calculating eq 1 with the constraints of preferred water quantity and quality indexes at the bahaoqiao node after neb z m i n and neb b m i n have been calculated we begin to identify the upper bound of the strategies for both players neb z m a x and neb b m a x the neb z m a x can be achieved through solving eqs 1 9 and 18 an adding constraint of beijing s strategy no less than neb b m i n which can be presented as follows j constraint of beijing s strategy 18 neb b neb b m i n similarly neb b m a x can be achieved to solve eqs 1 9 and 19 an added constraint of zhangjiakou s strategy no less than neb z m i n which can be presented as follows k constraint of zhangjiakou s strategy 19 neb z neb z m i n therefore the strategic spaces for zhangjiakou are str z neb z m i n neb z m a x additionally for the player of beijing the strategic spaces are str b neb b m i n neb b m a x once the strategy ranges of the two players are determined we can repeatedly solve eqs 1 9 by using the Œµ constraint method to generate noninferior solution sets between zhangjiakou and beijing whereas the net economic benefit of beijing is changed as a constraint and its value is repeatedly changed from neb b m i n to neb b m a x with an interval i e Œ¥ 1 0 10 8 cny yr this noninferior solution set illustrates how the players net benefits change with the selected strategies of each other and reflects the conflict of interest of the two involved players along with the noninferior solution set the two players are bargaining regarding which alternative should be adopted as a compromise solution it is usually difficult to choose an alternative from a set of alternatives if they are nondominated in this paper for selecting a compromise solution among the set of noninferior solutions we utilized the method of the two player rubinstein bargaining game which could simulate a somewhat realistic negotiation process sutton 1986 myerson 1991 kerachian et al 2010 the main process of the rubinstein bargaining game can be illustrated through a simple example assume that two players set out to divide one unit of money between them the players take turns making proposals at first player one proposes his share player two can either accept or reject the proposed share when player two accepts the proposal the game ends and the money is allocated according to the proposed share however if player two rejects player one s proposal he would be able to suggest a new share similarly the game ends if player one accepts the sharing rule if he rejects the proposal he could again suggest a new share the rubinstein bargaining solution could consider a discounting effect of the money which means that the present value of the money will decrease with increased bargaining rounds this provides a motive for the players to reach a quick agreement such a bargaining process was analyzed by rubinstein 1982 and binmore et al 1986 consider the alternating offers bargaining game with m stages as described before the game would end when the involved players accept a division neb z m neb b m in period m or obtain the outcome neb z m i n neb b m i n over the events of a breakdown of the bargaining process which means the status quo i e no loss no gain positions of the two players the preferences of the players can be defined as follows binmore et al 1986 20 œÄ z neb z m Œ¥ z m u z neb z m a n d œÄ b neb b m Œ¥ b m u b neb b m where œÄ k and Œ¥ k m are player k s preference and discount factors at m stage respectively the discount factor Œ¥ k m 0 1 can be considered as the patience of player k while u k presents the utility function of player k we assume that the utility functions of the players can be replaced by his her corresponding net benefits as follows 21 u k neb k m neb k m k z h a n g j i a k o u o r b e i j i n g additionally binmore et al 1986 proved that the optimal point neb z m neb b m of the mentioned bilateral bargaining can be achieved by maximizing the following nonlinear optimization problem 22 max z neb z m neb z m i n Œ± neb b m neb b m i n Œ≤ subject to 23 l n e b z m neb b m n e b where neb is the total net benefits of the grbm Œ± ln Œ¥ b m ln Œ¥ z m l n Œ¥ b m and Œ≤ 1 Œ± here Œ¥ b m is supposed to be equal to Œ¥ z m then eq 22 is presented as follows 24 max z neb z m neb z m i n 0 5 neb b m neb b m i n 0 5 the above equations can be solved according to the karush kuhn tucker kkt conditions kuhn and tucker 1951 3 5 reallocation by cooperative games a cooperative game cg indicates that stakeholders would prefer to form coalitions to utilize the resources available within their territories jointly and optimally for obtaining increased benefits coalitions can be classified as a subcoalition of one player a subcoalition and a grand coalition in this case study there are 2 players to form 3 coalitions which are two subcoalitions of one player and the grand coalition of the two players in the characteristic functions of a cooperative game the worth of each member can be regarded as neb z m i n and neb b m i n the net benefits of grand coalition neb tot equaling to neb will be achieved by solving equations 1 9 two solution conceptions of the cooperative game are discussed as follows 1 core solution in terms of mathematical programming the core is said to exist if both neb z and neb b can be maximized subject to equations 23 and 26 the core does not always exist that is there may be no distribution of gains that are satisfying the group rationality if the core is empty then a benefit subsidy from outside should be added to obtain a sustainable allocation if the core is not empty and is made of an infinite number of feasible allocations then all allocations within the core set can be achieved by solving the linear program lp consisting of eqs 23 and 25 26 as follows 25 max neb tot neb z neb b ‚Ö∞ feasibility and pareto optimality presented by equation 23 ‚Ö± group rationality neb z neb z m i n and neb b neb b m i n 26 2 nash solution the nash solution can be expressed as follows 27 max t n e b neb z neb z m i n neb b neb b m i n i subject to feasibility and pareto optimality eq 23 equations 23 and 27 can be solved by kkt conditions that are similar to solving the rubinstein bargaining model 4 results and discussions 4 1 optimization results of grbm application table 1 presents the total optimization benefits total water use and total pollutant discharge for zhangjiakou and beijing and the water quantity quality at the trans boundary node under the status quo initial allocation and reallocation scenarios under the status quo scenario the total net benefits of the entire basin would merely be 6 11 10 8 cny yr the net benefits of beijing are negative because of the high costs of sewage treatment zhangjiakou obtains 10 70 10 8 cny yr net benefits deriving most of its benefits 72 6 from urban water usages zhangjiakou s total water withdrawals and total codcr discharges make up almost 89 4 and 100 of the whole basin respectively whereas the pollutant discharges of beijing account for zero because of leaving the system neb of agriculture 2 93 10 8 c n y y r constitutes 27 4 of the overall gains of zhangjiakou but make up almost 68 7 of the total water use and approximately 31 3 of the total cod discharges the water released to the beijing is merely 98 1 m m 3 y r which is less than the minimum environmental inflows 126 3 m m 3 y r at the trans boundary node and the water quality is 68 mg l for codcr which is less than class v according to the chinese surface water standard i e gb3838 2002 the net benefits of the total basin of the initial allocation are improved to 17 53 10 8 cny yr contrasting to that of the status quo where nebb and nebz have been increased by 237 9 and 4 7 respectively therefore it can be inferred that the initial allocation may be easily accepted by both players because the net benefits of both players are better than the gains from the status quo the net benefits of agricultural water use in zhangjiakou are increased by 6 37 10 8 c n y y r f or the optimization of water use efficiencies however those of urban water use are decreased by 4 83 10 8 cny yr for the increased pollution reduction cost the total water usages of zhangjiakou would slightly decrease from 826 4 m m 3 y r to 796 3 m m 3 y r the amount of pollutant discharges are limited to 30 653 3 t o n y r and water quality in the trans boundary node is improved to 35 mg l the total net benefit of reallocation is 23 21 10 8 c n y y r which is much better than those of the initial allocation or status quo illustrating that the total net benefits of the basin will be greatly increased with certain cooperation the net benefits of zhangjiakou and beijing after side payments are 14 42 108 8 79 108 cny yr respectively in contrast to the initial allocation the upstream and downstream have been increased by 28 7 and 38 9 respectively however as shown in table 1 under the grand coalition the net benefit of zhangjiakou would decrease to 7 39 108 cny yr before side payment which is less than the initial allocation i e 11 20 108 cny yr it can be inferred that the reallocations cannot be automatically occurring for violating the individual rationality to realize a cooperative solution it is necessary to provide upstream side payments by the downstream or the outsider this actually happened in this case from 2010 the central government provided the upstream 5 0 108 cny yr to remove pollutants and to develop water saving agriculture under the reallocation scenario the total water usage of zhangjiakou is decreased by 601 4 m m 3 y r which is a decrease by 27 2 of water use under the initial allocations comparatively that of beijing has been increased by 316 7 m m 3 y r satisfying the city s average demands the allowed pollutant discharge of zhangjiakou city is limited to 16 926 2 t o n y r which is decreased by 44 8 in contrast to that of the initial allocation and consequently water quality can be improved to 20 mg l from the above discussion we observe that a being evaluated from the perspective of maximizing the net economic benefit reallocation is the best scheme followed by the initial distribution and the status quo is the worst and b if no side payment occurs the initial allocation would be the final outcome otherwise reallocation is supposed to be the final outcome and c the initial allocation is more stable than reallocation because of its compatible incentive 4 2 no inferior sets vs core sets and rubinstein bargaining vs nash solution fig 4 presents solution concepts of initial allocations and reallocations no inferior sets and rubinstein bargaining belong to the solutions of initial allocations comparatively core sets and the nash solution belong to solutions of reallocation as shown in fig 4 the noninferior solutions of net benefit allocations among the two players under the initial allocation scenario are the segmented curve bz the feasible strategies of beijing start from point b and end in point z along the curve with their values being changed from 4 24 108 to 8 41 108 cny yr and the feasible strategies of zhangjiakou begin at z and finish at b and their values change from 10 69 108 to 11 30 108 cny yr the main advantage of the noninferior solution curve is that each player can better understand how the strategies chosen would affect his her or other people s gains or losses and vice versa theoretically every point in bz is a feasible outcome of the initial allocations however zhangjiakou prefers the outcome of b or close to b while beijing prefers the outcome of z or close to z the final allocations depend on the bargaining power of the two players which are related to multiple factors such as outside alternatives when they fail to come to an agreement the discount rate and the patience of the players the two players will begin a series of rounds of bargaining and concession for example during the first bargaining round zhangjiakou provides his her first offer very close to his her maximum net benefits i e 11 30 108 cny yr and the corresponding value of beijing is very close to 4 24 108 cny yr as being expected beijing would not be satisfied with the results consequently he she will propose an alternative offer very close to his her maximum net benefits 8 41 108 cny yr and similarly it is rejected by zhangjiakou hence neither player would be satisfied with the results after the second round of negotiations a series of concessions and bargaining would be conducted to find a convergence the total process begins at points b and z and then as the bargaining process continues their proposed offers gradually move to point o as shown by the lines in fig 4 hence the point o is called as rubinstein bargaining solution the net benefit values of point o are 6 34 108 and 11 30 108 cny yr for beijing and zhangjiakou respectively which are also the results of the initial allocation the core solutions with the side payment under the reallocation scenario can be presented as the segmental line from point c1 to c2 in fig 4 the net benefit ranges of beijing and zhangjiakou within the core set are 4 24 108 12 52 108 cny yr and 10 69 108 18 97 108 cny yr respectively which illustrate that the core solutions weakly dominate the corresponding noninferior solutions therefore it can be inferred that the net benefits of the whole basin under reallocation can be improved relative to that of the initial allocations the net benefits of beijing and zhangjiakou in the nash solution would be 8 79 10 8 14 44 10 8 cny yr as point p showed in fig 4 and these benefits are better than the rubinstein bargaining solution point o for both players 4 3 influence of unclear initial water rights on allocations as shown in fig 4 the net benefits of the status quo point s are 4 59 108 and 10 70 108 cny yr for beijing and zhangjiakou respectively the status quo is usually treated as a starting point to begin cooperation or as a starting point to allocate incremental benefits however this status quo point usually benefits the upstream due to its favorable geographical position of hydrology the net benefits achieved from the status quo are not acceptable for beijing in this case according to beijing s views of initial water rights any net benefits assigned to him her less than 4 24 108 cny yr would be rejected by beijing these above two different views of water rights result in a new virtual starting point e 4 24 108 cny yr for beijing and 10 69 108 cny yr for zhangjiakou in fig 4 and thus form the strategy space bz or zb on the basis of it in contrast to the status quo unclear initial water rights result in narrowing strategy choices of the players during negotiation as any offer should simultaneously satisfy both players minimum net benefits determined by point e the narrowness of the strategy range may help the players feel more comfortable in making a difficult decision hence it could help the players quickly reach an agreement it should be pointed out that there not always exist overlaps of the strategies of the players do not always exist for example when the minimum objective value of zhangjiakou changed from points z to b and that of beijing changed from points b to z there would be no overlapping strategy space but the rubinstein bargaining solution is still effective 4 4 distribution of optimization results within a year figs 5a 5b present the monthly water usages of zhangjiakou and beijing under the initial allocation and reallocation scenarios among them fig 5a illustrates the monthly water usage of zhangjiakou it is easily found that the water consumptions of upstream both have two water use peaks under the two scenarios mainly occurring from april to august and from december to january which are the peak periods of agricultural water consumption and would account for approximately 84 5 and 87 7 of the annual total water use respectively the main difference between these two scenarios is that the water usages in reallocation during these months have been significantly reduced for being transferred to downstream water usages compared to that of initial allocations in fig 5b the monthly water consumptions of beijing are present the monthly water consumption values of beijing under the two scenarios are both relatively stable fig 6 presents the allowed pollutant discharges under the two scenarios initial allocation and reallocation the allowed pollutant discharges are small from november to february and may for low flows during the dry seasons and this trend is similar to the distribution of monthly water inflows under the initial allocation the allowed pollutant discharges from agriculture are much larger than that from urban use that means that municipal sewage is treated first when the pollution reduction rate is low as the urban pollutants reduction rate is high agricultural pollutant began to be treated to further improve the water quality under the reallocation scenario in fig 7 the monthly water inflows at the trans boundary node bahaoqiao are presented water inflows from december to january and from april to august under the reallocation scenario have been greatly increased relative to that of the initial allocations the cause of this phenomenon is the conversion of the upstream agricultural water to the downstream urban water use monthly concentrations of codcr at the trans boundary node are uniformly distributed and stable with 35 and 20 mg l under the initial allocation and reallocation respectively because they are constraints of the grbm 4 5 policy implication to deal with the increasingly serious water crisis in the river basin the chinese government has introduced some new water management systems in recent years such as the strictest water resources management system swrms that was proposed in 2009 sc 2012 and river chief system rcs in 2016 gocpccc and gosc 2016 swrms is symbolically dubbed three red lines representing a policy of 1 control of development and utilization of water resources 2 control of water use efficiency and 3 restriction of pollutants in water function areas sc 2012 rcs is a national river management policy that will cover every river and lake in the country by the end of 2018 it is classified into the four following levels provincial municipal county and township level additionally the corresponding head of the local governments at each level act as the river chief who take responsibility for managing and protecting the rivers and lakes major tasks will include water resource protection management and protection of riverbanks and lakeshores water pollution prevention and control ecological restoration and law enforcement supervision gocpccc and gosc 2016 in practice swrms and rcs are integrated into a whole system their performances will be evaluated based on the assessment system of swrms which includes quotas of total water use water efficiency and the rate of reaching the water standard of water function areas mwr and mep 2016 the advantages of swrms and rcs include the following 1 policy implementation has been strengthened with quantitative assessment of the performances of the chief executive of all levels of government 2 the power to manage water is highly concentrated alleviating the phenomenon of departmental conflicts caused by the fragmented management of water resources to a certain extent within the jurisdiction of administrative regions zuo et al 2014 wang et al 2017 however there are still gaps in the management of river basins across administrative regions it is mainly embodied at the two following aspects first there is no scientific method for determining the total water use quota and pollution discharge quota of each jurisdiction the used quotas come from water resource and water pollution controlling plans from the national to county level and these plans are unscientific unsystematic and impacted by many subjective factors of the decision makers zuo and li 2013 this mandatory order obedience and a top down method may ignore the benefit claims of stakeholders the rewards and costs of abiding by the orders are too low to constrain stakeholder behavior and an incentive compatibility mechanism has not yet been formed wang and cai 2011 ren 2015 the actual implementation often lacks the support of legal and policy tools at trans boundary river sections thus it is difficult to coordinate the benefit conflict between upstream and downstream and trans boundary water conflicts in the river basins of china are still problems since the conflicts of interest between the trans jurisdictions have not been fully discussed in swrms and rcs the analytic approach used in this article may assist the governments of trans boundary watersheds to communicate with each other understand the consequences of each other s strategy choices and develop schemes to allocate water use and pollutant discharge in an equal and efficient way to be specific in step 1 of the proposed methodology the main players should participate in the establishment of a water resources distribution model in the river basin sharing the data and knowledge and fostering a cooperative atmosphere in step 2 the method can be used as a negotiation support tool to determine the quotas of each jurisdiction within a trans boundary river basin in which the interests of each jurisdiction are fairly considered in step 3 the method and results can be used to facilitate water right trading and pollutant emissions trading among players and this facilitation is the future direction of swrms and rcs upgrading 5 conclusions to overcome the limitations of using conventional game theory methods in solving complicated trans jurisdiction water conflicts a hybrid game theory and mathematical programming model hgt mpm was advanced for solving trans boundary water conflicts at the watershed scale cooperative games with and without side payment were proposed and optimization was performed although cooperation with side payment is the ideal allocating results in that it promises the highest total net benefit it is difficult to achieve such cooperation in the studied river basin because few players especially downstream are willing to provide side payment because of unclear water rights it is more realistic that stakeholders define the initial water rights by cooperation without side payment at the first stage then the initial water rights can be upgraded to reallocation of water rights by cooperation with side payment at the second stage which is also called water right trading this method represented improvements upon the previous studies in a pursuing fair and efficient water resources and pollution discharge allocation among competing users at the basin scale taking into account unclear initial water rights and water quality issues b and proposing initial water and pollution discharge permit allocation based on the rubinstein bargaining theory and subsequent water and pollution discharge permits and net benefits reallocation based on cooperative game theory the developed model was then applied to solve trans boundary water conflicts in the guanting reservoir basin of north china in the case study the proposed model was successfully used to solve the water quantity and quality conflicts among jurisdictions under the context of unclear initial water rights the proposed hybrid method has explored water resources pollution discharge permits and benefits allocation among players under both a cooperative game with and without side payment providing the two following solutions rubinstein bargaining solution and nash solution the results of the case study show that extra economic benefits could be achieved through optimizing the combination demands of water quantity and quality for the two involved jurisdictions it is indicated that unclear initial water rights and pollution discharge permit rights would result in narrowing the strategy choice of players along no inferior sets during negotiation rubinstein bargaining solutions were recommended as the starting point to cooperation rather than those of the status quo in contrast to the gains under the status quo the net benefits of all players can be improved even if no side payment occurs especially for beijing though the benefits of all players can be improved from the status quo without side payment cooperative strategies with side payment from downstream or the central government to upstream provide the players with the maximum benefits without side payment the equilibrium results of the games of the studied basin would be performed as a rubinstein bargaining game the analytic approach and results are benefits for policy makers to share understand cooperate and develop schemes for conflict resolution the rubinstein bargaining solution can be applied as initial water right and pollutant discharge right allocation among zhangjiakou and beijing it is convenient to meet the needs of decision makers and their views on the initial allocation of water right by adding or reducing constraints in the water allocating model it is a useful complement of swrms as control indicators of the trans boundary river section the method and results of the nash solution can be used to facilitate water rights trading and pollutant emissions trading among the players and this facilitation is the future direction of swrs and rcs upgrading however the proposed methods were confined to two person games in the studied area the continuing research could be extended to multiperson games in this paper the nash solution as an approximation to the equilibria of rubinstein s alternating offers bargaining model proposed by binmore et al 1986 has been employed to solve the model although the relationship between cooperative and noncooperative approaches to bargaining are well understood for the case of two players it is a much more difficult problem for the two person nash solution to the n person as an extension of n person bargaining where the subgame perfect equilibrium spe outcome would be complicated and might not be unique depending on the negotiation protocol and the discount factor rate okazaki 1993 okada 1996 suh and wen 2006 torstensson 2009 fortunately britz et al 2010 proposed that in the limit as the exogenous risk of breakdown goes to zero stationary subgame perfect equilibrium payoffs converge to the weighted nash bargaining solution with the stationary distribution of the markov process as the weight vector of which the solution can be achieved by the traditional optimization algorithms or intelligent optimization algorithms for more details about the n person bargaining game and its application to water conflict resolution please see the related literatures chae yang 1994 kerachian et al 2010 attanasi et al 2015 ghodsi et al 2016 as the two person cooperative game was extended to n person more concepts of solutions besides the n person nash solution can be select to discuss and compare the equality and stability of the solution results mehrparvar et al 2016 shi et al 2016 additionally coalition analysis is another key point to solve complicated conflicts with more players detailed theoretical and case studies of n person cooperative game applications can be seen in kucukmehmetoglu and guldmann 2004 kucukmehmetoglu et al 2010 in addition certain simplifications and limits of the models included the scarce consideration of hydrological changes and reservoir operations these limits need further research to improve the modeling accuracy and to reflect the effectiveness of real water systems acknowledgments this work was supported by the national key research program of

6732,cyclic injection and production by a single well is a technique used in applications such as natural gas storage compressed air energy storage and periodic pumping tests the induced flow and saturation distribution can sometimes be modeled assuming two immiscible and incompressible fluids an analytical solution is derived for such one dimensional cyclic flow using the method of characteristics the solution usually exhibits a front or discontinuity in which case the contour integral method is applied in the derivation saturation s is expressed as a function of time distance from well mobility ratio and production to injection time ratio t prod t inj derivation is carried out for both linear s x and radial s r flow dependence of the solution on these parameters is explored and various cases are analyzed a simple model for viscosity reduction of the reservoir fluid is presented accounting for changes in mobility ratio e g following cyclic injection for enhanced oil recovery it is found that generally for t prod t inj 1 the solution converges to a periodic steady state however for t prod t inj 1 or when accounting for viscosity reduction such a state is not reached and the injected phase penetrates deeper with each cycle keywords cyclic injection two phase flow periodic flow analytical solution gas storage energy storage in aquifers 1 introduction the displacement of one phase by another in an immiscible process is a fundamental flow mechanism in reservoir modeling it is often used to model various scenarios such as waterflooding of oil bearing formations reservoir gas injection co2 storage in aquifers and various types of coreflooding experiments perhaps the most widely known model for two phase immiscible flow allowing an exact solution is that of buckley and leverett 1942 bl the original bl solution has been extended to accommodate different initial conditions cardwell 1959 mohsen 1985 heterogeneous reservoirs wu et al 1993 gravity effects bedrikovetsky 2013 and capillary pressure effects bedrikovetsky et al 1996 hussain et al 2012 deng and king 2015 however a detailed analytical investigation of cyclic bl flow for instance when injection and production are carried out consecutively from a single well has not been conducted this work derives an analytical solution for one dimensional cyclic and immiscible displacement of one incompressible phase by another cyclic injection into a reservoir usually consists of a single well performing subsequent periods of injection and extraction it is related to a number of applications some dating back to the early 1960 s the first is natural gas storage in water bearing formations katz and tek 1981 kanevskaya et al 1983 here the cyclic process is due to injection of natural gas into an aquifer during summer for storage and extraction in winter for heating the solution derived here can be used to estimate the volume of stored gas and it s distribution in the aquifer another relevant application is compressed air energy storage in aquifers allen et al 1984 kushnir et al 2010 oldenburg and pan 2013 a new technology proposed for storing renewable energy renewable sources such as wind and solar energy are intermittent and grid scale energy must be stored at times when there is more supply than demand for use when the renewable source is not available compressed air energy storage plants are currently in operation using underground caverns however these are limited in storage space and aquifers are being considered as an alternative cyclic injection into an aquifer can be conducted for example by injecting during the day when excess solar energy is available and producing at night to generate electricity cyclic injection is also conducted in periodic pumping tests black and kipp 1981 rabinovich et al 2015 a method for characterizing reservoirs these tests consist of repeated extraction and re injection of reservoir fluid so that a time periodic pressure signal is generated the method is usually applied to aquifers considering only single phase flow for estimation of the permeability however the method could be extended to two phase flow as proposed by fokker and verga 2011 the idea is to carry out a pumping test in which water is injected in a cyclic manner into an oil reservoir then by monitoring the produced fluids oil and water one can history matching to the solution presented here in order to estimate the two phase flow properties an application related to enhanced oil recovery is co2 cyclic injection also known as huff n puf patton et al 1982 ma et al 2016 this production method generally consists of three stages a period of co2 injection supercritical fluid or gas into the reservoir a soaking period in which no flow is induced to allow co2 to mix with oil and an extraction period to produce the oil these stages are repeated multiple times and thus the process is cyclic the method is based on a single well and therefore is particularly attractive for low permeability reservoirs in which well to well connections are difficult to establish the main advantages of co2 flooding are reduction of oil viscosity and interfacial tension which enhance production a variety of previous models for co2 cyclic injection have been considered e g black oil patton et al 1982 towler and wagle 1992 compositional hsu and brugman 1986 denoyelle and lemonnier 1987 and single phase fully miscible abedini and torabi 2014 colmenares and m√©ndez 2015 the immiscible model presented here has some major limitations first it does not take into consideration dissolution of co2 in oil and water leading to oil viscosity reduction and associated increased production second huff n puff is currently being considered mostly for production in unconventional rocks in which injection can only be carried out into fractures and not the low permeability matrix rock as would be modeled here however the current solution could still offer some insight on physics related to the co2 distribution and sharp front propagation for huff n puff in conventional rocks e g sandstones under certain conditions e g low injection pressure and supercritical co2 and for idealized studies e g coreflooding experiments this could also be a first step towards more accurate models which can be applied to realistic cases previous literature related to cyclic immiscible two phase flow is hard to find one relevant work that should be noted is by kanevskaya et al 1983 in which an analytical solution is presented however formulation of the front location which is at the heart of this solution is not carried out in fact kanevskaya et al 1983 assume that front velocity is equal to the velocity of the characteristic behind the front at each moment which is shown here not to be the case and calculated analytically in appendix a furthermore there is no detailed discussion of the solution for a wide range of parameters no comparison to a numerical solution and focus is only on gas storage applications another relevant work by johns 1993 derives analytical solutions to multiple slug injection in a partial miscible displacement while the method of tracking characteristics is similar to our approach the solution is different as we consider injection and production from the same well this work presents an analytical solution for two phase cyclic flow of immiscible and incompressible fluids saturation distribution and front location are derived using the method of characteristics a simple formula is presented allowing to calculate the solution as a function of time distance from well mobility ratio and cycle period dependence of the solution on these parameters is explored and solutions incorporating changes in mobility ratio are also analyzed the current solution allows for rapid computationally cheap calculations and provides physical insight with todays computational power and simulation software numerical solutions are by far the most common nevertheless analytical solutions have a number of advantages 1 physical insight obtained directly from the formulas 2 capability of benchmarking numerical codes and 3 extremely rapid computations allowing for scanning parametric space solving a large number of realizations or for decision making under very short time constraints 2 statement of the problem we consider immiscible two phase flow with incompressible fluids and rock homogeneous and isotropic permeability and constant porosity assuming one dimensional flow and negligible capillary pressure the governing equations are given by 1 s nw t u œï f nw s x 0 where 2 f nw 1 1 k rw Œº nw k rnw Œº w is the fractional flow of the nonwetting phase s nw is saturation of the nonwetting phase t is time x is the coordinate in the direction of displacement u is the injection velocity œï is porosity k rj s nw is the relative permeability to phase j j nw for nonwetting phase j w for wetting phase and Œº j the viscosity of phase j eq 1 is the well known bl equation buckley and leverett 1942 and given a constant injection velocity u the general solution is easily obtained boundary and initial conditions are necessary to complete the problem formulation we assume a drainage process to model injection of a nonwetting phase into a wetting phase saturated rock e g co2 injection into oil or natural gas into water thus u nw f nw u u at the injection boundary leading to 3 s nw x 0 t 1 s wr where s wr is the residual wetting phase saturation considering that the reservoir is fully saturated with the wetting phase before injection the initial condition is given by 4 s nw x t 0 0 the above formulation and can be easily adjusted to apply to imbibition e g waterflooding of oil bearing rocks by changing f nw to wetting phase fractional flow f w and s nw to wetting phase saturation s w the problem considered here is of cyclic injection i e subsequent periods of injection and production as depicted in fig 1 during an injection stage fig 1a nonwetting phase enters the system at x 0 with a given velocity u for a duration of t inj and the wetting phase is displaced further into the reservoir a front is formed at x x f so that for x x f only the wetting phase exists or a constant irreducible saturation during a production stage fig 1b both nonwetting and wetting phases exit the system at x 0 with given total velocity u for a duration of t prod during this stage the displaced wetting phase will flow back to fill the pore space that has been liberated by the production fig 1b blue arrows therefore an alternative way to describe the production stage is by considering injection of the wetting phase with velocity u at the location x x f kanevskaya et al 1983 the injection velocity is depicted in fig 2 shown to be a square wave function alternating between u for injection and u during production the figure shows that injection and production times are not necessarily equal however total cycle time is constant the formulation above can be extended to incorporate mutual miscibility of the two phases following derivations such as those in johns 1993 johns and orr 1996 and bedrikovetsky 2013 however we leave this to a separate work in which additional considerations such as solubility and sorption can be addressed and analyzed in detail 3 solution we begin by non dimensionalizing the problem described above we use a time scale t inj a length scale u t inj and a normalized saturation s s nw s i 1 s i s wr where s i is the irreducible nonwetting phase saturation and s wr is the residual wetting phase saturation this results in the following non dimensional variables x 1 s i s wr œï x ut inj t t t inj u 1 t inj 1 and t prod t prod t inj eqs 1 3 and 4 are then given by 5 s t f nw s x 0 s x 0 t 1 s x t 0 0 and the parameters controlling the solution s are t x t prod k rw k rnw and Œº w Œº nw these dimensionless groups are somewhat different than the typical groups in a bl problem which usually involve a characteristic length pertaining to the well to well distance however in single well cyclic injection this distance is not relevant while a new parameter i e the injection time t inj becomes important this explains our choice of dimensionless groups eq 5 is solved using the method of characteristics following derivations in bedrikovetsky 2013 we solve the problem for each stage separately beginning with the first injection stage in this case the problem is self similar and this so called buckley leverett solution contains a shock and rarefaction wave the characteristic curves given by d x d t df nw ds f nw are drawn in fig 3 a for an example case the figure shows that characteristics originating from t 0 x 0 are all perpendicular to the x axis since f nw s 0 0 this is typical for fractional flow functions the f nw function is assumed to have a structure widely used in the literature pertaining to drainage relative permeability of the following form 6a k rw 1 s n 6b k rnw s n where the same power n is taken for both curves for simplicity characteristics originating from t 0 x 0 centered wave have varying slopes depending on f nw s intersecting characteristic curves suggest a discontinuity representing the saturation front and drawn in fig 3a red curve its slope is given by the rankine hugoniot condition 7 d f nw s f nw s s s where s is saturation just before the front and s is the saturation after the front which is zero in this case substituting s 0 and f nw s 0 in eq 7 results in d f nw s s on the other hand d f nw s as seen in fig 3a combining the two relationships gives the following equation 8 s f f nw s f f nw s f allowing to find the front saturation s f s and location x f having expressed the characteristic curves and the front location for the first injection the full solution can be formulated as follows 9 x s t f nw s t s s f f nw s f t s s f s f is calculated by substituting eqs 2 and 6a b in eq 8 and taking n 2 which results in s f 1 1 Œº w Œº nw the saturation profile given by eq 9 corresponding to the characteristics of fig 3a is plotted in fig 4 a a numerical solution is plotted for reference showing a match with analytical results the problem of eq 5 for the next stage i e first production 1 t 1 t prod is not self similar and it contains simple waves that are the result of interaction between shock and rarefaction waves the problem of interaction between these waves is solved by the method of characteristics thus reducing the problem to an ordinary differential equation application of the method of contour integration proposed in bedrikovetsky 2013 yields the first integral of the problem allowing for an exact solution characteristics for the first production stage are depicted in fig 3b these are best described by considering the equivalent problem of wetting phase injection from the right side conducted at the final front location x max x max 2 16 in figs 3b and 4b this pseudo injection is in the x direction and has an initial saturation profile x i s given by eq 9 at t 1 therefore the characteristics originating from t 0 x 0 have a slope of f nw s i where s i is determined by the intersection of the characteristics with the x axis this occurs at the points t 0 x x i s i f nw s i characteristics originating from t 0 x x max centered wave also have a slope of f nw s for any given s the intersecting characteristic curves in fig 3b suggest a discontinuity in the solution the saturation profile can be expressed by x s t x i s f nw s t 1 s s t x max f nw s t 1 s s t 10 f nw s 2 t s s t f nw s f f nw s t 1 s s t where s and s are now the saturations after and before the discontinuity respectively notice that the solution at t 1 is in agreement with the injection profile given by eq 9 where the front is at f nw s f x max the first production solution as expressed by eq 10 may present negative values of x as the front returns to the well this is of course not physical and we regard only values of x 0 as the solution due to the initial condition in the production stage the problem is not self similar and the discontinuity drawn in fig 3b is not necessarily linear the discontinuity saturations s and s are not constant over this line and can be considered a function of t we use the contour integration method bedrikovetsky 2013 section 1 7 to obtain s t s t and the discontinuity line x f t the solution is presented in appendix a as a set of three algebraic equations the final solution for first production is depicted in fig 4b where the two saturation profiles separated by a discontinuity and corresponding to eq 10 are seen analytical saturation profiles and numerical solutions are shown to match the discontinuity arrives back at the production well earlier than t 2 as seen also in fig 3b however the injected fluid does not completely exit the system as a small nonwetting phase saturation remains tending to zero only for t prod the solution described above repeats itself for any number of cycles n we assume production time is long enough that the discontinuity always reaches the production well this is the case in co2 cyclic injection when production is usually carried out for a much longer duration than injection however short production times can be easily incorporated the final solution for any cycle n is given by 11 x n s t f nw s t n t cycle s s n t x i n 1 s f nw s t n t cycle s s n t for injection i e n t cycle t n t cycle 1 and 12 x n s t x i n s f nw s t n t cycle 1 s s n t x max n f nw s t n t cycle 1 s s n t for production i e n t cycle 1 t n 1 t cycle variables x n s t and s n s n are the solution and front saturations for the n th cycle total cycle time is t cycle 1 t prod the term x i n s in eq 12 is given by eq 11 at end of injection i e x i n s x n s n t cycle 1 x max n is the maximum extent of the nonwetting phase at end of injection given by x max n f nw s n the term x i n 1 s in eq 11 is the solution at end of production for cycle n 1 given by eq 12 the discontinuity at end of production reaches x 0 we assume t prod 1 and therefore x i n 1 s is continuous see next section and appendix for further illustration of the solution at end of production 3 1 solution in radial coordinates the formulation and derivations so far are presented in cartesian coordinates and the solution is obtained for a linear system in many cases a radial system is more appropriate particularly considering injection and production from a well the 1d radial solution is now detailed following derivations presented in johns 1993 and ling 2016 eq 1 in radial coordinates is given by 13 s nw t q 2 œÄ rh œï f nw s nw r 0 where r is the radius from the well q 2 œÄ r w hu is the volumetric flow rate and r w is the well radius applying the nondimensional coordinate transformation Œ∂ 1 s i s wr r 2 œÄ h œï qt inj t t t inj and s s nw s i 1 s i s wr we arrive at 14 s t f nw s Œ∂ 0 which has the same structure as eq 5 the solution to eq 14 for Œ∂ s t is then obtained as described in section 3 using eqs 11 and 12 the final solution for nondimensional radial coordinate is then given by r s t Œ∂ s t in the following we present solutions in radial coordinates to consider applications pertaining to 1d flow from a well 4 analysis the solution derived in the previous sections is now applied to investigate multiple cycles of injection and production considering a range of parameters fig 5 a depicts the saturation profiles at the end of injection t 1 5 9 19 and production t 2 8 20 for the case of equal injection and production durations i e t prod 1 a viscosity ratio of Œº w Œº nw 10 and a relative permeability power of n 2 are considered as in fig 4 in fact the solution for t 1 2 are identical to those in fig 4b the parameters used here will continue to be used throughout this work and referred to as the base case parameters fig 5a shows that the saturation after injection always has a similar structure of a sharp front interface and this is due to the discontinuity passing the front location of previous injections i e the penetration depth of the nonwetting phase slightly increases with each cycle this maximum penetration depth denoted x max n in eq 12 converges to a value of near 3 in the example as shown in the figure similarly the saturation profile at end of production also has a repeating structure showing no discontinuity this is due to the fact that the front always returns to the production well before the next injection stage begins the end of production solution is also shown to converge to a given saturation profile after a sufficient number of cycles overall we conclude from fig 5a that the saturation solution after 10 cycles will remain approximately the same for each cycle this converged solution is regarded as a periodic steady state a similar finding was presented in johns 1993 for interfering shocks of multiple slugs which converge to a long term solution in which shocks no longer interact fig 5b presents the same case as fig 5a but for radial flow a number of differences are apparent first the shape of saturation profiles in radial flow are slightly more concave than linear flow second the penetration depth is substantially larger for linear flow in comparison to radial flow and saturations are generally lower however this is not necessarily true for the dimensional coordinates since r x r x 2 1 s i s wr œï r w ut inj finally figs 5a b show that the radial solution converges to a periodic steady state earlier than the linear flow solution after 5 cycles compared to 10 we continue to consider equal injection and production times and assume a sufficient number of cycles so that the solution is converged fig 6 presents the saturation profiles at end of injection and production stages of the 10 th cycle for a varying viscosity ratio Œº w Œº nw and b varying power n in the relative permeability functions eqs 6a b in fig 6a it is apparent that for large viscosity ratios e g Œº w Œº nw 50 blue curve the nonwetting phase at end of injection t 19 penetrates deeper into the reservoir yet leaves behind much of the wetting phase this is consistent with a low viscosity phase displacing a highly viscous phase as viscosity ratio is lowered the injected phase is more efficient in removing the wetting phase however penetration distance is reduced the saturation profile at end of production t 20 shows lower nonwetting phase saturations for large viscosity ratios e g Œº w Œº nw 50 blue dashed curve but spread over a larger part of the reservoir the lower saturations are consistent with a high viscosity phase pseudo injection of wetting phase at the right side displacing a low viscosity phase fig 6b shows the variation in the converged saturation profiles for varying relative permeability functions the saturation profile after final production t 20 shows a monotonic increase with n this is similar to the saturation after final injection t 19 for r 0 5 where as the power n is increased the nonwetting phase saturation also increases however the front location penetration depth does not change monotonically with n increasing for n 2 but decreasing for n 2 this can be explained by observing the changes in penetration depth with each cycle until convergence for the first injection a larger n results in a smaller penetration depth however with each cycle the front penetrates deeper into the reservoir more rapidly for large n so that the converged profile may eventually have a deeper penetration than for lower n as is the case for n 2 in fig 6b next we consider longer production durations compared to injection fig 7 presents saturation profiles for t prod 1 up to 10 the results are for the 10 th cycle however for longer production times convergence to a steady time periodic solution occurs more rapidly and only 3 4 cycles are necessary to arrive at a converged solution in most cases the figure shows that for larger t prod the saturation after production t 20 decreases and tends to zero i e when approximately all nonwetting phase is removed at each production stage cycles in which more nonwetting phase is removed result in final injection stages that are smaller in penetration depth as seen in the figure it is therefore concluded that for sufficiently large t prod and t i e t prod 10 t 20 in fig 7 s r will converge to a periodic steady state solution in which approximately all of the injected phase is removed at each production stage this is of course not the case when considering the effects of hysteresis during imbibition carlson 1981 plohr et al 2001 schaerer et al 2006 however it is outside the scope of this work it is also not the case for shorter production durations t prod 1 which can also be modeled with the solution derived here fig 8 presents results for t prod 0 5 where it is apparent that the saturation at the end of each production stage is much larger than in previous cases figs 5 7 due to the shorter production time as a result each injection stage increases the nonwetting phase in the reservoir and penetration depth increases with every cycle fig 8 shows what appears to be a reduction of the added saturation with every cycle i e a larger increase between t 1 5 than between t 5 9 however this is only an artifact of the larger volumes of saturation already present at larger times and in fact the depth of the saturation front continues to increase indefinitely 4 1 modeling viscosity reduction one of the main processes related to co2 enhanced oil recovery is viscosity reduction of the oil which in turn allows increased oil production this can be incorporated into the cyclic two phase immiscible flow model by considering a different injection and production viscosity ratio thus we assign Œº w Œº nw inj r inj to represent initial injection viscosity ratio and a smaller ratio Œº w Œº nw prod r prod to represent reduced oil viscosity during production subsequent injection periods will also be assigned the ratio r inj assuming the high viscosity oil has filled the pore space near the well during production of the mobile oil this is a major simplification as the actual physical process is complex involving co2 dissolution in the oil followed by oil swelling viscosity and interfacial tension reduction and mineral precipitation however the current solution may provide some physical insight fig 9 presents the saturation solution for various times during the first production 1 t 2 considering oil viscosity reduced to a third of the initial viscosity r inj r prod 3 the previous solution for constant viscosity r inj r prod 1 is also plotted for comparison dashed lines it is evident that for reduced oil viscosity the solution is continuous without the advancing front seen for constant viscosity this is because the less viscous oil entering at the right tends to smear the discontinuity so that the co2 saturation increases gradually from x max towards the well mathematically this means s n s n in eq 12 furthermore the reduced viscosity oil is displaced more easily so that more oil is produced in comparison to the case of r inj r prod 1 and much of the co2 remains in the reservoir fig 10 shows multiple cycles considering reduced viscosity oil during production r inj r prod 3 only profiles at end of injection and production are shown it is apparent that with each injection period the co2 penetration is substantially increased this will continue indefinitely and thus no convergence takes place each production stage shows a smoothing of the saturation front and a large amount of co2 left in place as seen in the previous figure for a single cycle this suggests increased production of oil the impact of various degrees of oil viscosity reduction is seen in fig 11 the 5 th cycle is chosen rather arbitrarily as there is no convergence to a final saturation profile as production oil viscosity decreases i e larger r inj r prod the co2 reaches deeper into the reservoir and the production profiles resemble the injection profiles for the most part the largest viscosity reduction r inj r prod 50 for example shows that co2 saturation hardly changes during production except for a region near the inlet 0 r 1 in such cases much of the produced phase is comprised of oil and the co2 will penetrate the reservoir most efficiently for increasing values of production oil viscosity i e smaller r inj r prod co2 saturation decrease during production is more pronounced and the profiles reach the base case for r inj r prod 1 black lines 5 summary and conclusions we derived here an analytical solution to cyclic immiscible flow of two phases the saturation as a function of time and distance from injection is expressed and shown to be dependent on three non dimensional parameters relative permeability viscosity ratio and production time the solution is shown to have an advancing front during injection that recedes during production until returning back to the well at end of production some saturation of the injected phase remains in the reservoir and therefore the next injection stage can penetrate deeper it is shown that when production time is equal to or longer than injection t prod 1 after a number of injection and production cycles the solution converges to a periodic steady state on the other hand when production time is shorter than injection t prod 1 the saturation continues to increase and the front moves farther into the domain with each cycle investigation of the derived solution reveals the behavior with changing parameters thus a larger viscosity ratio Œº w Œº nw is associated with a deeper penetration of the injected nonwetting phase and a less efficient sweep however for the production stage a larger ratio results in a more efficient sweep i e less remaining nonwetting phase in the reservoir the impact of increasing production time in comparison to injection time t prod 1 shows faster convergence to a steady periodic state for sufficiently large t after convergence to a periodic steady state the nonwetting phase will almost completely leave the reservoir at the end of each production stage and therefore have a similar profile at the end of each injection stage we further analyze a solution in which viscosity ratio is increased during production times to model oil viscosity reduction associated with co2 huff n puff eor it is shown that incorporating reduced oil viscosity in the model leads to more co2 remaining in the reservoir at end of production indicating an increase in oil produced furthermore the injected co2 penetrates deeper into the reservoir with each cycle and the solution in this case does not converge the solution presented in this work is intended for use in a number of applications e g gas storage periodic pumping tests compressed air energy storage in aquifers and co2 cyclic injection it allows for rapid calculations which can give initial estimates of saturation profiles and sharp front locations it can also be used to validate numerical codes and for qualitative analysis of cyclic processes this work is a first step towards exact solutions of more complex cyclic processes which include for example dissolution appendix a we now detail the methods used here to obtain the location of saturation discontinuity and the saturations immediately before and after first we derive equations describing the solution discontinuity during the first production stage fig 12 depicts the front on a t vs x plot red curve for a given time t f the characteristics intersecting at the front are drawn the characteristics after and before the front have constant saturations s and s respectively the front is moving from x x max to x 0 we seek the front location x f and saturations s s the contour integral method suggests that integration of f nw d t sd x over the closed contour x max 1 x i 1 x f t f x max 1 is zero this results in the equation 15 x max x i s i d x x i x f s d x 1 t f f nw s d t x f x max s d x t f 1 f nw s d t 0 and after considering the constant saturations along the characteristics and the pseudo injection at x x max we arrive at 16 x max x i s i d x t f 1 1 f nw s s x f x max 1 t f 1 f nw s s x i x f 0 two additional equations are obtained by simple geometry as follows 17 f nw s x i x f t f 1 f nw s x max x f t f 1 and solving the system of eqs 16 and 17 gives x f s and s a second method for locating the saturation discontinuity was implemented in calculations of multiple cycles i e figs 5 11 this method is based on a graphical material balance fig 13 shows the solution for injection during a second cycle at two different times the curves for upper and lower solutions dashed and dotted lines correspond to the functions in eq 11 for s s upper and s s lower it is well known that the discontinuity connecting the upper and lower solutions divides the curves into two regions of equal areas cardwell 1959 thus the front in the full solutions solid lines is determined such that s 1 s 2 and s 3 s 4 this method was validated against the contour integral described above for the first and second cycles and shown to be equivalent it is noted that for the production stage once the discontinuity has reached x 0 the methods above will yield a non physical front location of x f 0 in this case the solution is given by the lower function in eq 12 s s beginning at x x max s 0 and increasing until x 0 
6732,cyclic injection and production by a single well is a technique used in applications such as natural gas storage compressed air energy storage and periodic pumping tests the induced flow and saturation distribution can sometimes be modeled assuming two immiscible and incompressible fluids an analytical solution is derived for such one dimensional cyclic flow using the method of characteristics the solution usually exhibits a front or discontinuity in which case the contour integral method is applied in the derivation saturation s is expressed as a function of time distance from well mobility ratio and production to injection time ratio t prod t inj derivation is carried out for both linear s x and radial s r flow dependence of the solution on these parameters is explored and various cases are analyzed a simple model for viscosity reduction of the reservoir fluid is presented accounting for changes in mobility ratio e g following cyclic injection for enhanced oil recovery it is found that generally for t prod t inj 1 the solution converges to a periodic steady state however for t prod t inj 1 or when accounting for viscosity reduction such a state is not reached and the injected phase penetrates deeper with each cycle keywords cyclic injection two phase flow periodic flow analytical solution gas storage energy storage in aquifers 1 introduction the displacement of one phase by another in an immiscible process is a fundamental flow mechanism in reservoir modeling it is often used to model various scenarios such as waterflooding of oil bearing formations reservoir gas injection co2 storage in aquifers and various types of coreflooding experiments perhaps the most widely known model for two phase immiscible flow allowing an exact solution is that of buckley and leverett 1942 bl the original bl solution has been extended to accommodate different initial conditions cardwell 1959 mohsen 1985 heterogeneous reservoirs wu et al 1993 gravity effects bedrikovetsky 2013 and capillary pressure effects bedrikovetsky et al 1996 hussain et al 2012 deng and king 2015 however a detailed analytical investigation of cyclic bl flow for instance when injection and production are carried out consecutively from a single well has not been conducted this work derives an analytical solution for one dimensional cyclic and immiscible displacement of one incompressible phase by another cyclic injection into a reservoir usually consists of a single well performing subsequent periods of injection and extraction it is related to a number of applications some dating back to the early 1960 s the first is natural gas storage in water bearing formations katz and tek 1981 kanevskaya et al 1983 here the cyclic process is due to injection of natural gas into an aquifer during summer for storage and extraction in winter for heating the solution derived here can be used to estimate the volume of stored gas and it s distribution in the aquifer another relevant application is compressed air energy storage in aquifers allen et al 1984 kushnir et al 2010 oldenburg and pan 2013 a new technology proposed for storing renewable energy renewable sources such as wind and solar energy are intermittent and grid scale energy must be stored at times when there is more supply than demand for use when the renewable source is not available compressed air energy storage plants are currently in operation using underground caverns however these are limited in storage space and aquifers are being considered as an alternative cyclic injection into an aquifer can be conducted for example by injecting during the day when excess solar energy is available and producing at night to generate electricity cyclic injection is also conducted in periodic pumping tests black and kipp 1981 rabinovich et al 2015 a method for characterizing reservoirs these tests consist of repeated extraction and re injection of reservoir fluid so that a time periodic pressure signal is generated the method is usually applied to aquifers considering only single phase flow for estimation of the permeability however the method could be extended to two phase flow as proposed by fokker and verga 2011 the idea is to carry out a pumping test in which water is injected in a cyclic manner into an oil reservoir then by monitoring the produced fluids oil and water one can history matching to the solution presented here in order to estimate the two phase flow properties an application related to enhanced oil recovery is co2 cyclic injection also known as huff n puf patton et al 1982 ma et al 2016 this production method generally consists of three stages a period of co2 injection supercritical fluid or gas into the reservoir a soaking period in which no flow is induced to allow co2 to mix with oil and an extraction period to produce the oil these stages are repeated multiple times and thus the process is cyclic the method is based on a single well and therefore is particularly attractive for low permeability reservoirs in which well to well connections are difficult to establish the main advantages of co2 flooding are reduction of oil viscosity and interfacial tension which enhance production a variety of previous models for co2 cyclic injection have been considered e g black oil patton et al 1982 towler and wagle 1992 compositional hsu and brugman 1986 denoyelle and lemonnier 1987 and single phase fully miscible abedini and torabi 2014 colmenares and m√©ndez 2015 the immiscible model presented here has some major limitations first it does not take into consideration dissolution of co2 in oil and water leading to oil viscosity reduction and associated increased production second huff n puff is currently being considered mostly for production in unconventional rocks in which injection can only be carried out into fractures and not the low permeability matrix rock as would be modeled here however the current solution could still offer some insight on physics related to the co2 distribution and sharp front propagation for huff n puff in conventional rocks e g sandstones under certain conditions e g low injection pressure and supercritical co2 and for idealized studies e g coreflooding experiments this could also be a first step towards more accurate models which can be applied to realistic cases previous literature related to cyclic immiscible two phase flow is hard to find one relevant work that should be noted is by kanevskaya et al 1983 in which an analytical solution is presented however formulation of the front location which is at the heart of this solution is not carried out in fact kanevskaya et al 1983 assume that front velocity is equal to the velocity of the characteristic behind the front at each moment which is shown here not to be the case and calculated analytically in appendix a furthermore there is no detailed discussion of the solution for a wide range of parameters no comparison to a numerical solution and focus is only on gas storage applications another relevant work by johns 1993 derives analytical solutions to multiple slug injection in a partial miscible displacement while the method of tracking characteristics is similar to our approach the solution is different as we consider injection and production from the same well this work presents an analytical solution for two phase cyclic flow of immiscible and incompressible fluids saturation distribution and front location are derived using the method of characteristics a simple formula is presented allowing to calculate the solution as a function of time distance from well mobility ratio and cycle period dependence of the solution on these parameters is explored and solutions incorporating changes in mobility ratio are also analyzed the current solution allows for rapid computationally cheap calculations and provides physical insight with todays computational power and simulation software numerical solutions are by far the most common nevertheless analytical solutions have a number of advantages 1 physical insight obtained directly from the formulas 2 capability of benchmarking numerical codes and 3 extremely rapid computations allowing for scanning parametric space solving a large number of realizations or for decision making under very short time constraints 2 statement of the problem we consider immiscible two phase flow with incompressible fluids and rock homogeneous and isotropic permeability and constant porosity assuming one dimensional flow and negligible capillary pressure the governing equations are given by 1 s nw t u œï f nw s x 0 where 2 f nw 1 1 k rw Œº nw k rnw Œº w is the fractional flow of the nonwetting phase s nw is saturation of the nonwetting phase t is time x is the coordinate in the direction of displacement u is the injection velocity œï is porosity k rj s nw is the relative permeability to phase j j nw for nonwetting phase j w for wetting phase and Œº j the viscosity of phase j eq 1 is the well known bl equation buckley and leverett 1942 and given a constant injection velocity u the general solution is easily obtained boundary and initial conditions are necessary to complete the problem formulation we assume a drainage process to model injection of a nonwetting phase into a wetting phase saturated rock e g co2 injection into oil or natural gas into water thus u nw f nw u u at the injection boundary leading to 3 s nw x 0 t 1 s wr where s wr is the residual wetting phase saturation considering that the reservoir is fully saturated with the wetting phase before injection the initial condition is given by 4 s nw x t 0 0 the above formulation and can be easily adjusted to apply to imbibition e g waterflooding of oil bearing rocks by changing f nw to wetting phase fractional flow f w and s nw to wetting phase saturation s w the problem considered here is of cyclic injection i e subsequent periods of injection and production as depicted in fig 1 during an injection stage fig 1a nonwetting phase enters the system at x 0 with a given velocity u for a duration of t inj and the wetting phase is displaced further into the reservoir a front is formed at x x f so that for x x f only the wetting phase exists or a constant irreducible saturation during a production stage fig 1b both nonwetting and wetting phases exit the system at x 0 with given total velocity u for a duration of t prod during this stage the displaced wetting phase will flow back to fill the pore space that has been liberated by the production fig 1b blue arrows therefore an alternative way to describe the production stage is by considering injection of the wetting phase with velocity u at the location x x f kanevskaya et al 1983 the injection velocity is depicted in fig 2 shown to be a square wave function alternating between u for injection and u during production the figure shows that injection and production times are not necessarily equal however total cycle time is constant the formulation above can be extended to incorporate mutual miscibility of the two phases following derivations such as those in johns 1993 johns and orr 1996 and bedrikovetsky 2013 however we leave this to a separate work in which additional considerations such as solubility and sorption can be addressed and analyzed in detail 3 solution we begin by non dimensionalizing the problem described above we use a time scale t inj a length scale u t inj and a normalized saturation s s nw s i 1 s i s wr where s i is the irreducible nonwetting phase saturation and s wr is the residual wetting phase saturation this results in the following non dimensional variables x 1 s i s wr œï x ut inj t t t inj u 1 t inj 1 and t prod t prod t inj eqs 1 3 and 4 are then given by 5 s t f nw s x 0 s x 0 t 1 s x t 0 0 and the parameters controlling the solution s are t x t prod k rw k rnw and Œº w Œº nw these dimensionless groups are somewhat different than the typical groups in a bl problem which usually involve a characteristic length pertaining to the well to well distance however in single well cyclic injection this distance is not relevant while a new parameter i e the injection time t inj becomes important this explains our choice of dimensionless groups eq 5 is solved using the method of characteristics following derivations in bedrikovetsky 2013 we solve the problem for each stage separately beginning with the first injection stage in this case the problem is self similar and this so called buckley leverett solution contains a shock and rarefaction wave the characteristic curves given by d x d t df nw ds f nw are drawn in fig 3 a for an example case the figure shows that characteristics originating from t 0 x 0 are all perpendicular to the x axis since f nw s 0 0 this is typical for fractional flow functions the f nw function is assumed to have a structure widely used in the literature pertaining to drainage relative permeability of the following form 6a k rw 1 s n 6b k rnw s n where the same power n is taken for both curves for simplicity characteristics originating from t 0 x 0 centered wave have varying slopes depending on f nw s intersecting characteristic curves suggest a discontinuity representing the saturation front and drawn in fig 3a red curve its slope is given by the rankine hugoniot condition 7 d f nw s f nw s s s where s is saturation just before the front and s is the saturation after the front which is zero in this case substituting s 0 and f nw s 0 in eq 7 results in d f nw s s on the other hand d f nw s as seen in fig 3a combining the two relationships gives the following equation 8 s f f nw s f f nw s f allowing to find the front saturation s f s and location x f having expressed the characteristic curves and the front location for the first injection the full solution can be formulated as follows 9 x s t f nw s t s s f f nw s f t s s f s f is calculated by substituting eqs 2 and 6a b in eq 8 and taking n 2 which results in s f 1 1 Œº w Œº nw the saturation profile given by eq 9 corresponding to the characteristics of fig 3a is plotted in fig 4 a a numerical solution is plotted for reference showing a match with analytical results the problem of eq 5 for the next stage i e first production 1 t 1 t prod is not self similar and it contains simple waves that are the result of interaction between shock and rarefaction waves the problem of interaction between these waves is solved by the method of characteristics thus reducing the problem to an ordinary differential equation application of the method of contour integration proposed in bedrikovetsky 2013 yields the first integral of the problem allowing for an exact solution characteristics for the first production stage are depicted in fig 3b these are best described by considering the equivalent problem of wetting phase injection from the right side conducted at the final front location x max x max 2 16 in figs 3b and 4b this pseudo injection is in the x direction and has an initial saturation profile x i s given by eq 9 at t 1 therefore the characteristics originating from t 0 x 0 have a slope of f nw s i where s i is determined by the intersection of the characteristics with the x axis this occurs at the points t 0 x x i s i f nw s i characteristics originating from t 0 x x max centered wave also have a slope of f nw s for any given s the intersecting characteristic curves in fig 3b suggest a discontinuity in the solution the saturation profile can be expressed by x s t x i s f nw s t 1 s s t x max f nw s t 1 s s t 10 f nw s 2 t s s t f nw s f f nw s t 1 s s t where s and s are now the saturations after and before the discontinuity respectively notice that the solution at t 1 is in agreement with the injection profile given by eq 9 where the front is at f nw s f x max the first production solution as expressed by eq 10 may present negative values of x as the front returns to the well this is of course not physical and we regard only values of x 0 as the solution due to the initial condition in the production stage the problem is not self similar and the discontinuity drawn in fig 3b is not necessarily linear the discontinuity saturations s and s are not constant over this line and can be considered a function of t we use the contour integration method bedrikovetsky 2013 section 1 7 to obtain s t s t and the discontinuity line x f t the solution is presented in appendix a as a set of three algebraic equations the final solution for first production is depicted in fig 4b where the two saturation profiles separated by a discontinuity and corresponding to eq 10 are seen analytical saturation profiles and numerical solutions are shown to match the discontinuity arrives back at the production well earlier than t 2 as seen also in fig 3b however the injected fluid does not completely exit the system as a small nonwetting phase saturation remains tending to zero only for t prod the solution described above repeats itself for any number of cycles n we assume production time is long enough that the discontinuity always reaches the production well this is the case in co2 cyclic injection when production is usually carried out for a much longer duration than injection however short production times can be easily incorporated the final solution for any cycle n is given by 11 x n s t f nw s t n t cycle s s n t x i n 1 s f nw s t n t cycle s s n t for injection i e n t cycle t n t cycle 1 and 12 x n s t x i n s f nw s t n t cycle 1 s s n t x max n f nw s t n t cycle 1 s s n t for production i e n t cycle 1 t n 1 t cycle variables x n s t and s n s n are the solution and front saturations for the n th cycle total cycle time is t cycle 1 t prod the term x i n s in eq 12 is given by eq 11 at end of injection i e x i n s x n s n t cycle 1 x max n is the maximum extent of the nonwetting phase at end of injection given by x max n f nw s n the term x i n 1 s in eq 11 is the solution at end of production for cycle n 1 given by eq 12 the discontinuity at end of production reaches x 0 we assume t prod 1 and therefore x i n 1 s is continuous see next section and appendix for further illustration of the solution at end of production 3 1 solution in radial coordinates the formulation and derivations so far are presented in cartesian coordinates and the solution is obtained for a linear system in many cases a radial system is more appropriate particularly considering injection and production from a well the 1d radial solution is now detailed following derivations presented in johns 1993 and ling 2016 eq 1 in radial coordinates is given by 13 s nw t q 2 œÄ rh œï f nw s nw r 0 where r is the radius from the well q 2 œÄ r w hu is the volumetric flow rate and r w is the well radius applying the nondimensional coordinate transformation Œ∂ 1 s i s wr r 2 œÄ h œï qt inj t t t inj and s s nw s i 1 s i s wr we arrive at 14 s t f nw s Œ∂ 0 which has the same structure as eq 5 the solution to eq 14 for Œ∂ s t is then obtained as described in section 3 using eqs 11 and 12 the final solution for nondimensional radial coordinate is then given by r s t Œ∂ s t in the following we present solutions in radial coordinates to consider applications pertaining to 1d flow from a well 4 analysis the solution derived in the previous sections is now applied to investigate multiple cycles of injection and production considering a range of parameters fig 5 a depicts the saturation profiles at the end of injection t 1 5 9 19 and production t 2 8 20 for the case of equal injection and production durations i e t prod 1 a viscosity ratio of Œº w Œº nw 10 and a relative permeability power of n 2 are considered as in fig 4 in fact the solution for t 1 2 are identical to those in fig 4b the parameters used here will continue to be used throughout this work and referred to as the base case parameters fig 5a shows that the saturation after injection always has a similar structure of a sharp front interface and this is due to the discontinuity passing the front location of previous injections i e the penetration depth of the nonwetting phase slightly increases with each cycle this maximum penetration depth denoted x max n in eq 12 converges to a value of near 3 in the example as shown in the figure similarly the saturation profile at end of production also has a repeating structure showing no discontinuity this is due to the fact that the front always returns to the production well before the next injection stage begins the end of production solution is also shown to converge to a given saturation profile after a sufficient number of cycles overall we conclude from fig 5a that the saturation solution after 10 cycles will remain approximately the same for each cycle this converged solution is regarded as a periodic steady state a similar finding was presented in johns 1993 for interfering shocks of multiple slugs which converge to a long term solution in which shocks no longer interact fig 5b presents the same case as fig 5a but for radial flow a number of differences are apparent first the shape of saturation profiles in radial flow are slightly more concave than linear flow second the penetration depth is substantially larger for linear flow in comparison to radial flow and saturations are generally lower however this is not necessarily true for the dimensional coordinates since r x r x 2 1 s i s wr œï r w ut inj finally figs 5a b show that the radial solution converges to a periodic steady state earlier than the linear flow solution after 5 cycles compared to 10 we continue to consider equal injection and production times and assume a sufficient number of cycles so that the solution is converged fig 6 presents the saturation profiles at end of injection and production stages of the 10 th cycle for a varying viscosity ratio Œº w Œº nw and b varying power n in the relative permeability functions eqs 6a b in fig 6a it is apparent that for large viscosity ratios e g Œº w Œº nw 50 blue curve the nonwetting phase at end of injection t 19 penetrates deeper into the reservoir yet leaves behind much of the wetting phase this is consistent with a low viscosity phase displacing a highly viscous phase as viscosity ratio is lowered the injected phase is more efficient in removing the wetting phase however penetration distance is reduced the saturation profile at end of production t 20 shows lower nonwetting phase saturations for large viscosity ratios e g Œº w Œº nw 50 blue dashed curve but spread over a larger part of the reservoir the lower saturations are consistent with a high viscosity phase pseudo injection of wetting phase at the right side displacing a low viscosity phase fig 6b shows the variation in the converged saturation profiles for varying relative permeability functions the saturation profile after final production t 20 shows a monotonic increase with n this is similar to the saturation after final injection t 19 for r 0 5 where as the power n is increased the nonwetting phase saturation also increases however the front location penetration depth does not change monotonically with n increasing for n 2 but decreasing for n 2 this can be explained by observing the changes in penetration depth with each cycle until convergence for the first injection a larger n results in a smaller penetration depth however with each cycle the front penetrates deeper into the reservoir more rapidly for large n so that the converged profile may eventually have a deeper penetration than for lower n as is the case for n 2 in fig 6b next we consider longer production durations compared to injection fig 7 presents saturation profiles for t prod 1 up to 10 the results are for the 10 th cycle however for longer production times convergence to a steady time periodic solution occurs more rapidly and only 3 4 cycles are necessary to arrive at a converged solution in most cases the figure shows that for larger t prod the saturation after production t 20 decreases and tends to zero i e when approximately all nonwetting phase is removed at each production stage cycles in which more nonwetting phase is removed result in final injection stages that are smaller in penetration depth as seen in the figure it is therefore concluded that for sufficiently large t prod and t i e t prod 10 t 20 in fig 7 s r will converge to a periodic steady state solution in which approximately all of the injected phase is removed at each production stage this is of course not the case when considering the effects of hysteresis during imbibition carlson 1981 plohr et al 2001 schaerer et al 2006 however it is outside the scope of this work it is also not the case for shorter production durations t prod 1 which can also be modeled with the solution derived here fig 8 presents results for t prod 0 5 where it is apparent that the saturation at the end of each production stage is much larger than in previous cases figs 5 7 due to the shorter production time as a result each injection stage increases the nonwetting phase in the reservoir and penetration depth increases with every cycle fig 8 shows what appears to be a reduction of the added saturation with every cycle i e a larger increase between t 1 5 than between t 5 9 however this is only an artifact of the larger volumes of saturation already present at larger times and in fact the depth of the saturation front continues to increase indefinitely 4 1 modeling viscosity reduction one of the main processes related to co2 enhanced oil recovery is viscosity reduction of the oil which in turn allows increased oil production this can be incorporated into the cyclic two phase immiscible flow model by considering a different injection and production viscosity ratio thus we assign Œº w Œº nw inj r inj to represent initial injection viscosity ratio and a smaller ratio Œº w Œº nw prod r prod to represent reduced oil viscosity during production subsequent injection periods will also be assigned the ratio r inj assuming the high viscosity oil has filled the pore space near the well during production of the mobile oil this is a major simplification as the actual physical process is complex involving co2 dissolution in the oil followed by oil swelling viscosity and interfacial tension reduction and mineral precipitation however the current solution may provide some physical insight fig 9 presents the saturation solution for various times during the first production 1 t 2 considering oil viscosity reduced to a third of the initial viscosity r inj r prod 3 the previous solution for constant viscosity r inj r prod 1 is also plotted for comparison dashed lines it is evident that for reduced oil viscosity the solution is continuous without the advancing front seen for constant viscosity this is because the less viscous oil entering at the right tends to smear the discontinuity so that the co2 saturation increases gradually from x max towards the well mathematically this means s n s n in eq 12 furthermore the reduced viscosity oil is displaced more easily so that more oil is produced in comparison to the case of r inj r prod 1 and much of the co2 remains in the reservoir fig 10 shows multiple cycles considering reduced viscosity oil during production r inj r prod 3 only profiles at end of injection and production are shown it is apparent that with each injection period the co2 penetration is substantially increased this will continue indefinitely and thus no convergence takes place each production stage shows a smoothing of the saturation front and a large amount of co2 left in place as seen in the previous figure for a single cycle this suggests increased production of oil the impact of various degrees of oil viscosity reduction is seen in fig 11 the 5 th cycle is chosen rather arbitrarily as there is no convergence to a final saturation profile as production oil viscosity decreases i e larger r inj r prod the co2 reaches deeper into the reservoir and the production profiles resemble the injection profiles for the most part the largest viscosity reduction r inj r prod 50 for example shows that co2 saturation hardly changes during production except for a region near the inlet 0 r 1 in such cases much of the produced phase is comprised of oil and the co2 will penetrate the reservoir most efficiently for increasing values of production oil viscosity i e smaller r inj r prod co2 saturation decrease during production is more pronounced and the profiles reach the base case for r inj r prod 1 black lines 5 summary and conclusions we derived here an analytical solution to cyclic immiscible flow of two phases the saturation as a function of time and distance from injection is expressed and shown to be dependent on three non dimensional parameters relative permeability viscosity ratio and production time the solution is shown to have an advancing front during injection that recedes during production until returning back to the well at end of production some saturation of the injected phase remains in the reservoir and therefore the next injection stage can penetrate deeper it is shown that when production time is equal to or longer than injection t prod 1 after a number of injection and production cycles the solution converges to a periodic steady state on the other hand when production time is shorter than injection t prod 1 the saturation continues to increase and the front moves farther into the domain with each cycle investigation of the derived solution reveals the behavior with changing parameters thus a larger viscosity ratio Œº w Œº nw is associated with a deeper penetration of the injected nonwetting phase and a less efficient sweep however for the production stage a larger ratio results in a more efficient sweep i e less remaining nonwetting phase in the reservoir the impact of increasing production time in comparison to injection time t prod 1 shows faster convergence to a steady periodic state for sufficiently large t after convergence to a periodic steady state the nonwetting phase will almost completely leave the reservoir at the end of each production stage and therefore have a similar profile at the end of each injection stage we further analyze a solution in which viscosity ratio is increased during production times to model oil viscosity reduction associated with co2 huff n puff eor it is shown that incorporating reduced oil viscosity in the model leads to more co2 remaining in the reservoir at end of production indicating an increase in oil produced furthermore the injected co2 penetrates deeper into the reservoir with each cycle and the solution in this case does not converge the solution presented in this work is intended for use in a number of applications e g gas storage periodic pumping tests compressed air energy storage in aquifers and co2 cyclic injection it allows for rapid calculations which can give initial estimates of saturation profiles and sharp front locations it can also be used to validate numerical codes and for qualitative analysis of cyclic processes this work is a first step towards exact solutions of more complex cyclic processes which include for example dissolution appendix a we now detail the methods used here to obtain the location of saturation discontinuity and the saturations immediately before and after first we derive equations describing the solution discontinuity during the first production stage fig 12 depicts the front on a t vs x plot red curve for a given time t f the characteristics intersecting at the front are drawn the characteristics after and before the front have constant saturations s and s respectively the front is moving from x x max to x 0 we seek the front location x f and saturations s s the contour integral method suggests that integration of f nw d t sd x over the closed contour x max 1 x i 1 x f t f x max 1 is zero this results in the equation 15 x max x i s i d x x i x f s d x 1 t f f nw s d t x f x max s d x t f 1 f nw s d t 0 and after considering the constant saturations along the characteristics and the pseudo injection at x x max we arrive at 16 x max x i s i d x t f 1 1 f nw s s x f x max 1 t f 1 f nw s s x i x f 0 two additional equations are obtained by simple geometry as follows 17 f nw s x i x f t f 1 f nw s x max x f t f 1 and solving the system of eqs 16 and 17 gives x f s and s a second method for locating the saturation discontinuity was implemented in calculations of multiple cycles i e figs 5 11 this method is based on a graphical material balance fig 13 shows the solution for injection during a second cycle at two different times the curves for upper and lower solutions dashed and dotted lines correspond to the functions in eq 11 for s s upper and s s lower it is well known that the discontinuity connecting the upper and lower solutions divides the curves into two regions of equal areas cardwell 1959 thus the front in the full solutions solid lines is determined such that s 1 s 2 and s 3 s 4 this method was validated against the contour integral described above for the first and second cycles and shown to be equivalent it is noted that for the production stage once the discontinuity has reached x 0 the methods above will yield a non physical front location of x f 0 in this case the solution is given by the lower function in eq 12 s s beginning at x x max s 0 and increasing until x 0

streamflow response at the seasonal and the rainfall runoff event time scale varies with increasing spatial scale and ii identify the main factors controlling the temporal variability of streamflow response in three mountain catchments in the italian dolomites we used precipitation and streamflow data from june to september of 13 consecutive years 2005 2017 available for all three catchments and computed runoff coefficients stormflow volumes streamflow peaks and lag times between the rainfall centroid and the streamflow peak for 203 rainfall runoff events occurred during the study period results show that overall specific streamflow and runoff coefficients decreased with the increasing spatial scale however this pattern was disrupted at the end of spring beginning of summer due to the relevant snowmelt contribution to streamflow in the intermediate catchment characterized by the largest fraction of high elevation areas where deep snowpack accumulated during the winter the probability distribution of runoff coefficients was very well represented by a beta distribution for all three catchments suggesting that analogous factors controlled the variability of runoff coefficients this was confirmed by multiple regression analysis that revealed that event rainfall amount storm duration and 3 12 days antecedent precipitation assumed as a proxy for antecedent wetness conditions explained up to 0 81 of the variability of streamflow response with a minor role of rainfall intensity further research is needed to assess whether detailed measurements of hydrological variables collected at the small catchment scale 1 km2 could be deemed as representative for the hydrological response of larger catchments keywords streamflow response mountain catchments multiple spatial scales runoff coefficient streamflow peak antecedent precipitation 1 introduction streamflow response within and among catchments is highly variable through time and space zimmer and gannon 2018 land use and land cover modifications are among the main relevant drivers of streamflow dynamics woldesenbet et al 2018 these changes interact with hydroclimatic forcing such as antecedent conditions and rainfall characteristics and other physical variables such as soil properties and topography and contribute to large spatio temporal variabilities in streamflow generation rodr√≠guez blanco et al 2012 nippgen et al 2016 investigating these spatio temporal variabilities and their controlling factors is essential to better understand the hydrological functioning of catchments ares et al 2018 and to obtain a deeper knowledge of water availability for people and ecosystems this is particularly critical in mountain catchments as they provide freshwater for many people living in downstream areas and habitats for a high number of animal and plant species schmeller et al 2018 streamflow response in mountain catchments is more difficult to understand compared to lowland areas as runoff flow pathways are influenced by bedrock permeability highly variable topography and soil depth zhang et al 2018 zuecco et al 2018 due to the large spatial heterogeneity in landscape characteristics of mountain regions process oriented studies are often conducted in small typically 10 km2 headwater catchments where hydroclimatic forcing and bio geophysical characteristics are less heterogeneous zimmer and gannon 2018 detailed measurements of hydrological processes especially in mountain areas are thus usually obtained in small experimental headwater or low order catchments mcglynn et al 2013 gregoretti et al 2016 llorens et al 2018 van meerveld et al 2018 zuecco et al 2018 however water resource planning and management are most often carried out in mesoscale catchments 100 km2 e g soulsby et al 2003 2004 melland et al 2018 therefore a better understanding on how streamflow response varies from small to large spatial scales in mountain settings is pivotal to support land and water management decisions however linking similarities between water fluxes across small and mesoscale catchments is difficult because spatial heterogeneity in landscape characteristics increases with catchment size hampering the distinction of complex relationships and feedbacks between runoff controls troch et al 2015 zimmer and gannon 2018 moreover because dominant flow pathways may vary among nearby tributaries different runoff responses can alter the presence absence or detection of scaling effects sidle et al 2017 thus upscaling process understanding achieved in small experimental catchments to larger scales is still challenging shaman et al 2004 soulsby et al 2006 sidle 2006 sidle et al 2017 a few studies have analysed the streamflow response at increasing spatial scales from small to mesoscale catchments in mountain regions for instance soulsby et al 2003 used tracer based hydrograph separation techniques to investigate changes in runoff processes with landscape characteristics in different subcatchments of the feugh catchment scotland ranging in size from 1 to 233 km2 they found that overland flow and shallow subsurface stormflow were the dominant contributors to storm runoff with groundwater contribution to annual runoff ranging between 30 and 60 in the smallest and larger catchments respectively soulsby et al 2003 in a follow up study in the same area soulsby et al 2004 used a combination of hydrometric and hydrochemical data collected over a hydrological year to assess the usefulness of tracers in upscaling flow path understanding they related the observed degree of variation in streamflow to geology land cover and soil properties the applied tracers indicated the rate of groundwater recharge the geochemistry of groundwater storages and the influence of peat acidic soils in storm runoff generation and catchment recession soulsby et al 2004 didszun and uhlenbrook 2008 analysed low flow stream chemistry and rainfall event response in nested catchments ranging in size from 0 015 to 258 km2 in the black forest mountains germany to assess how the fundamental runoff generation mechanisms changed with spatial scale they found that small catchments less than 1 2 km2 were non representative for runoff generation in larger catchments due to the topographic structure and a reduced number of runoff components they also saw that in catchments larger than 40 km2 surface runoff from urban areas became increasingly important moreover small differences in the tracer signature in catchments between 1 and 40 km2 were found suggesting that tracers can provide detailed information into the scaling of the main runoff mechanisms didszun and uhlenbrook 2008 zillgens et al 2007 examined 201 rainfall runoff events in three nested catchments of the austrian alps of 0 07 15 and 150 km2 to comprehend how hydrological processes were related across different spatial scales their results showed that two types of runoff events existed at the three scales viz a unimodal event type with a quick rising and falling hydrograph and a bimodal event type with a double peak hydrograph they observed that in all cases where a bimodal event occurred at the microscale the hydrographs at the larger scales showed damped recessions and that the bimodal events were characterized by much higher runoff volumes than the unimodal events at all scales they found that the occurrence of the two event types was consistent over three orders of catchment size and concluded that the runoff behaviour of the headwater may be used as an indicator of the runoff behaviour of much larger areas zillgens et al 2007 richardson et al 2012 investigated the daily streamflow dynamics in six catchments in a peatland complex in ontario canada ranging in size from 8 to 200 km2 they found that during high flow periods runoff production increased with catchment area up to 50 km2 and then declined with further increases in catchment size up to 200 km2 but that during low flow periods runoff production did not change consistently across scales in the end they argued that the observed differences in runoff generation were controlled by differences in the size and geomorphologic properties of wet prone near streams zones richardson et al 2012 finally recent findings by wilkinson and bathurst 2018 investigated the relationship between rainfall spatial variability and runoff response over spatial scales from 1 1 to 2286 km2 in the eden catchment uk they observed that peak specific streamflow for winter events remained fairly constant with area of up to 20 30 km2 corresponding to the main upland headwater catchments thereafter decreasing with the increasing size the runoff response to convective storms depended on the rainfall position and peak discharge varied significantly from the winter storms moreover they derived an average scaling law for peak discharge for large synoptic storms revealing the non linear nature of the cross scale variations wilkinson and bathurst 2018 as these examples demonstrate there is a certain amount of research on comparing streamflow dynamics across different spatial scales particularly some studies were carried out following the nested catchment approach that can provide valuable information into hydrological functioning at different scales sidle et al 2017 because it shows how catchment scale processes and their distribution reflect changes in water fluxes and propagate downstream ebel and mirus 2014 penna et al 2017b however to the best of our knowledge no study has been performed in high elevation dolomitic regions where snowmelt is an important water input in addition to rainfall events and where karst features may hide water and release it with different timing compared to catchments lying on a less fractured substratum in this study we analysed streamflow response at the monthly and rainfall runoff event timescale during the summer months in a gauged dolomitic nested catchment in the italian alps ranging in size from less than 1 km2 to more than 100 km2 our working hypothesis is that specific streamflow decreases in magnitude with the increasing spatial scale but that streamflow dynamics and hydrological processes observed in the first order catchment are representative for processes observed in the mesoscale catchment particularly our study aims to answer the following research questions i how does the catchment streamflow response during the summer months and the rainfall runoff event timescale vary with the increase in spatial scale ii what are the main controls on the temporal variability of streamflow response at different spatial scales in nested alpine catchments 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the upper cordevole river basin italian dolomites eastern alps fig 1 and includes three nested catchments bridge creek catchment bcc 0 14 km2 cordevole catchment at la vizza 7 3 km2 and cordevole catchment at saviner 109 km2 the main land cover consists of alpine grassland and its fraction area decreases as a function of elevation and with increasing catchment area table 1 subvertical dolomitic rock cliffs dolomia principale formation can be found in the upper part of la vizza and saviner catchments dolomia cassiana dolomite and san cassiano formations carbonate and terrigenous sandstones and claystones constitute the lithology of bcc and the main lithologies of la vizza penna et al 2017b zuecco et al 2018 downstream in the cordevole catchment lithology changes to formations of clastic deposits mainly conglomerates and sandstones upper middle triassic alternated with limestones sometimes with evaporitic rocks lower triassic soils presenting silicatic siltic parent material are moderately deep with acid reaction and a good drainage capacity soil type distribution is quite similar across the three catchments slopes are characterised by the presence of leptsols in the steeper areas and cambisols where slopes are gentler while the valley bottom shows also the presence of luvisols with a higher differentiation between soil layers the hypsometric curves of la vizza and saviner have similar shapes while the hypsometric curve of bcc is more regular spanning a smaller range of elevations compared to the two other catchments table 1 and fig 2 particularly la vizza has the highest mean elevation and about 25 of its area is above 2500 m a s l and more than 90 is above 2000 m a s l fig 2 the high elevations table 1 and the geographical location in the internal portion of the southern alps determine that approximately half of the mean annual precipitation on average 1220 mm per year at bcc and la vizza falls as snow while average monthly temperatures have a minimum of 5 7 c in january and a maximum of 14 1 c in july bcc and la vizza snowfalls generally occur from late october to april and rarely in may june and september snowmelt starts in march and lasts few weeks in bcc due to the homogeneous aspect of the catchment south east oriented table 1 while at la vizza and saviner snowmelt can last until july because of the high elevations and the more heterogeneous aspect of the hillslopes from june to september most precipitation falls as rain table 2 maximum average rainfall depth occurs in august due to frequent storms while the minimum is in september 2 2 hydrometeorological data the study period includes data from june to september the period with negligible or the lowest snow cover of 13 successive years 2005 2017 precipitation and air temperature were measured all year round by heated tipping buckets and temperature sensors located at different elevations fig 1 and operated by the agency for environmental protection of veneto region arpav for bcc we interpolated precipitation data from the arabba 1645 m a s l and pordoi pass 2155 m a s l stations using the inverse distance weighted method penna et al 2017b for la vizza catchment we used precipitation data from the pordoi pass station for saviner catchment we used thiessen polygons to interpolate precipitation measured at five stations with elevations ranging from 1007 to 2155 m a s l continuous streamflow measurements at the outlet are available for all catchments table 3 except for bcc data are provided by arpav in bcc water stage is measured by a pressure transducer behind a v notch weir and it is converted to streamflow based on the weir equation at la vizza outlet water stage is measured by a transducer installed behind a v notch weir while an ultrasonic gauging system is used at saviner outlet water stages in la vizza and saviner are converted to streamflow by rating curves developed and checked by arpav in addition soil moisture was measured continuously at a 15 min interval during june october 2010 2013 at six different locations at 5 20 and 40 cm depth in a riparian hillslope transect in bcc penna et al 2016 zuecco et al 2018 in this study we used hillslope averaged antecedent soil moisture at 5 and 30 cm average between 20 and 40 cm considered representative for the soil moisture conditions of bcc hillslopes penna et al 2011 to assess whether antecedent wetness conditions controlled the streamflow response during the rainfall runoff events depth to water table was measured continuously at a 15 min interval in piezometers located in the riparian zone and the hillslopes in bcc penna et al 2015a zuecco et al 2019b due to the damage caused by avalanches during the snowmelt period the network of piezometers changed throughout the years zuecco et al 2018 therefore in this study we considered only depth to water table measured in a piezometer in the riparian zone p17 and one in the mid hillslope m12 in the period june september 2011 2013 installation depths were 0 60 and 1 60 m from the soil surface for p17 and m12 respectively 2 3 data analysis rainfall runoff event characteristics were used to compare the streamflow response in the three study catchments rainfall runoff events that were included in the analysis occurred in the period june september from 2005 to 2017 and they were selected according to the following conditions a a total event precipitation equal or larger than 5 mm b two events were separated by at least 6 h with no precipitation penna et al 2011 zuecco et al 2019b c a minimum difference of 0 01 mm h between peak and pre event specific streamflow at the three outlets d a rainfall onset within three hours in all the three catchments for each rainfall runoff event we computed several predictors of the event streamflow response i e total event rainfall mean and maximum rainfall intensity storm duration normalized antecedent precipitation index up to 12 days hillslope averaged antecedent soil moisture at 5 and 30 cm depth in bcc and antecedent water table at the two piezometers in bcc table 4 and four event streamflow metrics i e runoff coefficient stormflow volume peak streamflow lag time between the rainfall centroid and the streamflow peak table 5 stormflow volumes were determined using the constant k method of blume et al 2007 specific streamflow i e streamflow per catchment area is reported throughout the paper for catchment comparison purposes in this work we quantified antecedent precipitation computing the normalized antecedent precipitation index napi proposed by heggen 2001 this index includes antecedent precipitation for the very day of a given event and considers a normalization to the rain gauge mean and to the antecedent series length napi is defined as 1 napi t 0 i p t k t p t 1 i k t where i is the series length days p t is the precipitation at the day t and p is the average daily precipitation decay coefficient k is a catchment and seasonal parameter that generally ranges between 0 80 and 0 98 viessman and lewis 1996 here we adopted the midrange value of 0 90 as suggested by heggen 2001 the lag time between rainfall input and streamflow output is an important indicator of the catchment hydrological properties and provides useful insights to understand streamflow generation processes haga et al 2005 asano and uchida 2018 here we computed the lag time centroid lag to peak dingman 2002 as the time difference in hours between the streamflow peak and the rainfall centroid for each event the temporal variability in runoff coefficients was analysed fitting beta distributions to the cumulative distribution functions of runoff coefficients of each catchment individually merz et al 2006 the beta cumulative distribution function is given by 2 f x Œ± Œ≤ 1 b Œ± Œ≤ 0 1 x Œ± 1 1 x Œ≤ 1 d x where x is the event runoff coefficient b Œ± Œ≤ is the beta function and Œ± and Œ≤ are the shape parameters of the beta distribution the cumulative distribution function of the beta distribution was fitted by minimising the root mean squared differences rmse between the empirical and the fitted cumulative distribution functions 95 confidence intervals of the Œ± and Œ≤ parameters were also computed in order to determine the most important predictors of the four metrics of streamflow response in the three study catchments we used a forward stepwise multiple linear regression e g mcintyre et al 2007 l√≥pez taraz√≥n et al 2010 taguas et al 2017 lacombe et al 2018 rodr√≠guez blanco et al 2019 we included all predictors variables in the models that were significant with p 0 05 for each multiple linear regression model we show the different steps with the selected predictors and their significance p values the adjusted r2 and the mean squared errors mse fig 11 and fig s2 the multiple regression analysis was carried out for the 203 selected rainfall runoff events and on a subset of 42 rainfall runoff events for which soil moisture and depth to water table data were available fig 11 and fig s2 to determine whether snowmelt affected runoff generation during late spring early summer we quantified the snow cover area sca in the three catchments over the years 2005 2017 we computed monthly average values of sca based on the modis aqua sensor we preferred not to use sca data at higher temporal resolution due to the documented possible lower resolution in forested areas e g parajka et al 2012 gascoin et al 2015 compared to forest free terrain values of sca were obtained from myd10a1 006 aqua snow cover daily global 500 m hall and riggs

quality are 0 best 1 good 2 ok 3 poor not currently in use images with an average data quality value over 0 5 on a per catchment basiswere excluded from the analysis 3 results 3 1 seasonal variability in streamflow and precipitation the three study catchments did not have a statistically different monthly mean precipitation depth in the june september period over the study years table 2 kruskal wallis one way analysis of variance p 0 05 june and july had almost the same precipitation depth while august was the month with the highest precipitation depth due to the frequent summer storms the lowest precipitation depth was observed in september a month also characterized by rare snowfall producing a thin snowpack that immediately melts the time averaged hydrograph 2005 2017 for the june september period shows overall consistent temporal patterns of the precipitation runoff relation in the three catchments with a good visual agreement in the streamflow response to precipitation inputs fig 3 however la vizza in june was characterized by much higher flows compared to bcc and saviner fig 3 and table 3 and bcc in august and especially in september showed higher flows compared to the two other catchments fig 3 higher flows in la vizza compared to bcc were also evident in the range of 0 04 0 3 of exceedance probability whereas the highest streamflow values with very low exceedance probability were recorded for bcc and likely related to intense rainfall events fig 4 mean and median specific streamflow decreased with the increasing catchment area except during the high flow period in june for la vizza table 3 and fig 3 we relate these late spring early summer high flows in la vizza to snowmelt still occurring in high elevation areas which are proportionally larger in la vizza compared to the two other catchments fig 2 by early mid july specific streamflow in la vizza and saviner markedly decreased indicating a depleting snowmelt source fig 3 and from that time onward streamflow in bcc remained constantly higher than in the two other catchments indeed the modis based analysis of monthly change in sca reveals an important reduction in sca between may and june that was particularly marked for la vizza catchment fig 5 this indicates that the snow areal depletion in la vizza was highest leading to larger snowmelt inputs in this catchment compared to bcc and saviner as a result of these dynamics the interannual variability in streamflow shaded bands in fig 3 the monthly streamflow range maximum minimum and the streamflow variability expressed by the coefficient of variation were larger in la vizza and bcc than in saviner and overall for the three sites coefficients of variations were higher in july and august table 3 fig 6 shows examples of june september hydrographs in years characterized by different snow accumulation during winter all the three catchments exhibited a marked interannual variability in streamflow especially in june reflecting the variability in meteorological forcing low streamflow values were observed in june 2015 due to a scarce snow accumulation during the 2014 2015 winter and the following spring while moderately high streamflow was evident in june 2016 due to a moderate snow accumulation during the winter see caption of fig 6 for sca values higher streamflow values were recorded in june 2011 when the catchments were characterized by similar sca with respect to june 2016 because of important precipitation inputs and thus the occurrence of rain on snow events high streamflow at la vizza and saviner were also observed during june 2014 a period characterized by very low precipitation but following high snow accumulation during winter 2013 2014 and spring 2014 conversely low baseflow was found in bcc in june 2014 due to a scarcity of rainfall events compared to 2015 2016 and 2011 fig 6 the double mass curves built for the entire observation period fig s1 clearly show a decrease in specific streamflow with increasing spatial scale more interesting the shape of the monthly double mass curves grouped per month fig 7 reflects the averaged hydrographs fig 3 in june cumulative streamflow in la vizza was higher than the precipitation input fig 6 slope 1 as a result of the notable snowmelt inputs in the following months the slope of the double mass curve of la vizza decreased and it was between the double mass curves of bcc and saviner saviner had the double mass curve with the lowest slope except in june when late snowmelt determined a slope of the curve very similar to the one obtained for bcc the double mass curves of bcc had the largest slope except in june compared to la vizza and saviner remarkably in september the cumulative streamflow in bcc exceeded the cumulative precipitation fig 7 slope 1 indicating that streamflow was sustained by other water sources in addition to precipitation 3 2 seasonal variability at the rainfall runoff event scale the 203 selected rainfall runoff events had similar characteristics in the three catchments in terms of total event rainfall storm duration napi and lag time kruskal wallis one way analysis of variance p 0 05 table 4 and table 5 conversely there were significant differences in mean and maximum rainfall intensity with larger intensities in la vizza than in bcc and saviner and in three hydrological response metrics i e peak streamflow stormflow and runoff coefficient kruskal wallis one way analysis of variance p 0 05 in bcc and la vizza peak streamflow stormflow and runoff coefficients were similar but significantly larger than in saviner dunn multiple comparison test p 0 05 table 5 the temporal variability in runoff coefficients decreased with the increasing spatial scale fig 8 runoff coefficients were particularly variable in time in bcc in june and august while they had small variations in saviner especially in july at the monthly scale runoff coefficients in saviner were significantly different and smaller than in bcc and la vizza dunn multiple comparison test p 0 05 in la vizza runoff coefficients were less variable in time and generally smaller compared to bcc except in july but there was not a significant difference at the monthly scale between runoff coefficients in the two catchments dunn multiple comparison test p 0 05 the scatterplots between runoff coefficients in different catchments confirmed that rainfall runoff events in la vizza had runoff coefficients always larger than in saviner except for few events occurring mostly in june and july fig 9 overall there was not a clear distinction of runoff coefficients based on the months although bcc had some runoff coefficients smaller than la vizza and saviner concentrated in july and august the relation between runoff coefficients in bcc and la vizza had a slope close to 1 but it was less clear for very low runoff coefficients approximately 0 1 probably because of large differences in total event rainfall or stormflow measured in the two catchments 3 3 statistical analysis of streamflow response 3 3 1 beta distribution beta distributions fitted very well the empirical cumulative distributions of the runoff coefficients in the three catchments visual inspection of fig 10 as also indicated by the very low values of rmse 0 002 0 0002 and 0 005 for bcc la vizza and saviner respectively the Œ± parameters of the fitted beta distributions were 1 03 95 confidence interval 0 82 1 29 2 12 95 confidence interval 1 76 2 54 and 1 99 95 confidence interval 1 56 2 54 for bcc la vizza and saviner respectively the Œ≤ parameters were 9 1 95 confidence interval 7 3 11 3 25 5 95 confidence interval 21 1 30 7 and 42 7 95 confidence interval 35 1 51 9 for bcc la vizza and saviner respectively while the Œ± parameters were quite similar in la vizza and saviner and larger than the Œ± parameter obtained for bcc the Œ≤ parameters increased with the increasing area of the catchments and generally were one order of magnitude larger than the Œ± parameters furthermore a seasonal pattern in the empirical cumulative distributions of the runoff coefficients was not identified in the three catchments because rainfall runoff events with small and large runoff coefficients were almost equally distributed in the four study months inset of fig 10 3 3 2 multiple regression analysis the multiple linear regression analysis for the 203 and the 42 rainfall runoff events shows that all the statistical models used to predict the four metrics of streamflow response in the three study catchments were highly significant fig 11 and fig s2 however the amount of variation in the response metric explained by the predictors varied when considering the different statistical models and the catchments for instance the regressions explaining the variability in stormflow for the 203 events had the largest adjusted determination coefficients 0 81 0 75 and 0 80 for bcc la vizza and saviner respectively fig 11 left column while the lowest efficiency was found for the models explaining the lag time adjusted r2 was 0 52 0 14 and 0 40 for bcc la vizza and saviner respectively fig s2 left panel overall the statistical models performed better for bcc than the larger spatial scales la vizza and saviner the best multiple linear models were identified with a minimum of two steps and predictors for lag time in la vizza and saviner fig s2 left panel and a maximum of six steps and predictors for peak streamflow in la vizza fig 11 left column total event rainfall was the only predictor present in all multiple linear regression models for all three catchments it entered the models usually during step 1 had a high significance p 0 001 and explained most of the variability fig 11 left column storm duration was the second most important predictor entering the models during step 1 to explain runoff coefficient in bcc and saviner and in step 2 to predict stormflow and lag time in bcc and saviner fig 11 left column however storm duration was a less important independent variable in the models predicting the response metrics in la vizza e g storm duration was not significant p 0 05 in the models explaining stormflow and lag time napis and maximum and mean rainfall intensity were also identified as significant predictors but they were usually less significant and important than total event rainfall and storm duration napi3 and 9 were the napis occurring more often in the statistical models while napi10 12 were not significant in any of the multiple linear regressions fig 11 left column the application of the stepwise multiple linear regression to a subset of 42 rainfall runoff events for which antecedent soil moisture and depth to water table data were available at bcc confirmed the relevant role of total event rainfall in explaining all metrics of streamflow response in the three catchments it entered the models during step 1 or 2 explaining most of the adjusted r2 fig 11 right column and fig s2 right panel conversely storm duration was a less important predictor compared to the regressions determined using all the 203 rainfall runoff events antecedent soil moisture and depth to water table were not able to capture the same or more variability in the metrics of streamflow response compared to napi1 12 fig 11 right column and fig s2 right panel indeed hillslope averaged antecedent soil moisture at 5 cm depth was a significant predictor of runoff coefficient in bcc p 0 005 and saviner p 0 05 and stormflow in bcc p 0 01 hillslope averaged antecedent soil moisture at 30 cm depth was a significant predictor only of peak streamflow in saviner p 0 05 while the antecedent depth to water table at piezometer p17 was a significant predictor only of lag time in bcc p 0 05 for this subset of 42 rainfall runoff events the most significant napis were found for a number of days larger than 8 showing therefore important differences in the napi predictors compared to the regression models obtained using the larger dataset fig 11 4 discussion 4 1 variability of streamflow response with increasing spatial scales streamflow response at different catchment scales especially in mountain catchments is typically characterized by a marked variability controlled by various drivers often combined the results of this study for three alpine catchments in the italian dolomites confirm this behaviour our analysis clearly indicates that specific streamflow decreased with the increasing catchment size during the summer months not affected by snowmelt figs 3 and 4 the same was observed for peak streamflow stormflow and runoff coefficients for the selected rainfall runoff events table 5 and fig 8 this reactive behaviour is consistent with what was observed in other multi scale studies soulsby et al 2003 zillgens et al 2007 richardson et al 2012 wilkinson and bathurst 2018 and appears not to be specifically related to dolomitic catchments as small headwater catchments incorporate proportionally larger areas of high runoff production with respect to less runoff productive lowland areas wilkinson and bathurst 2018 independently from the geological setting this is mainly due to the high slope table 1 and shallow soils in bcc that lead to rapid formation of lateral subsurface flow greatly contributing to stream runoff penna et al 2015a 2016 zuecco et al 2019b in addition the damped streamflow response of saviner could be attributed to the assumed larger storage typically varying with catchment size richardson et al 2012 creutzfeldt et al 2014 pfister et al 2017 and the higher buffer capability of large riparian areas with deeper soils found in larger catchments however we did not compute the storage for the three study catchments because hydrological data for bcc were available only for four months of the year moreover the different streamflow responses could be related to the increasingly important role of evapotranspiration at la vizza and saviner over bcc due to their proportionally larger areas covered with shrubs and forests table 1 however evapotranspiration data are currently not available for the study areas further analyses are advisable to test the role of storage and evapotranspiration fluxes on the decreasing hydrological response with increasing spatial scale in the upper cordevole river basin lag times generally increase with increasing catchment size and decreasing topographic gradient since the distance to the catchment outlet and therefore the travel time increase montgomery and dietrich 2002 wilkinson and bathurst 2018 moreover lag times are controlled by runoff processes on hillslopes and by channel routing as the topography of first order catchments is composed mostly of steep hillslopes and channel networks asano and uchida 2018 additional controls on catchment response times were identified in the main flow path length channel slope channel roughness relative relief catchment concavity and shape howard 1990 gericke and smithers 2014 and references therein as a result of these different and often combined effects large variabilities in catchment response time were documented for instance wilkinson and bathurst 2018 found marked temporal shifts in the streamflow response at larger scales up to roughly 16 h although their study catchments in uk were overall larger than those investigated here in our case we did not find any relation between lag times and catchment scale lag times for the 203 analysed events were slightly shorter for la vizza the intermediate catchment but there was no statistically significant difference among the three catchments table 5 these results are in agreement with the findings by didszun and uhlenbrook 2008 who showed small and similar lag times for 13 german catchments with a size comparable to that of the catchments reported in our study we have no strong evidence to support a plausible explanation of similar lag times in the three study catchments in addition to possible topographic controls we hypothesize that this behaviour might be related to the inclusion in the computation of mean lag times of rainfall events characterized by possible influence of snowmelt only in the upper catchments and of short convective rainfall events and long autumn like precipitation events these latter two potentially characterized by much different lag times however further specific analyses should be carried out to better investigate the causes of this behaviour an evident difference in mean specific streamflow was observed in late spring early summer when la vizza showed higher flows compared to the two other catchments fig 3 the lack of difference in precipitation depth for the three catchments table 2 the much larger fractions of areas at high elevation above 2600 m a s l for la vizza fig 2 and the more marked difference in specific streamflow between la vizza and the other catchments in years with moderate to high snow accumulation e g 2014 and 2016 see fig 6 clearly indicate the significant role of snowmelt on the hydrological response of this catchment this confirms the importance of snow derived meltwater in alpine catchments e g kobierska et al 2013 engel et al 2016 schmieder et al 2016 penna et al 2017a zuecco et al 2019a especially in karst areas of the alps finger et al 2013 generally from mid july onward e g at the end of the melting season streamflow at bcc was consistently higher than at la vizza and saviner figs 3 and 4 and interestingly in september the cumulative streamflow in bcc exceeded the cumulative precipitation slope 1 in fig 7 this observation indicates that another water source in addition to rainfall and snowmelt must exist in bcc to feed the stream also during baseflow conditions we attribute this behaviour to the contribution of shallow subsurface flow in agreement with previous field observations on the presence of perennial springs at bcc one of which discharges relatively high flows to the bridge creek and tracer based quantification of pre event water and on the role of hillslope shallow groundwater to stream runoff camporese et al 2014 penna et al 2015a 2016 zuecco et al 2019b the role of the perennial spring in sustaining streamflow during baseflow conditions is consistent with the results about the importance of springs in controlling the extent of flow in other mountain catchments guida et al 2016 lovill et al 2018 especially in karst regions hu et al 2015 4 2 main controls on the temporal variability of streamflow response 4 2 1 distribution of runoff coefficients the event runoff coefficient is a key concept in catchment hydrology and can be used as a diagnostic metric to describe streamflow generation in catchments merz et al 2006 our results showed that the empirical distribution of runoff coefficients in the three study alpine catchments was very well fitted by a beta distribution fig 10 with rmses even smaller than the low ones reported by merz et al 2006 for 337 austrian catchments this excellent fit also agrees with the findings by gottschalk and weingartner 1998 for a group of alpine catchments in switzerland but in their case runoff coefficients were generally smaller 0 2 compared to our study sites due to the relatively small part of the high elevation catchments that was active in quick runoff generation the large differences observed between the Œ± and Œ≤ parameters of the fitted beta distributions for the three study catchments indicate that the distributions of the runoff coefficients were highly skewed to the right merz et al 2006 due to the large frequencies of small runoff coefficients the increase of the Œ≤ parameter from bcc to la vizza to saviner reflects the increase in catchment size and the decrease of runoff coefficients figs 8 10 with differences in the runoff coefficients among the three sites particularly marked above the frequency of 0 6 fig 10 despite these differences the shapes of the cumulative distribution functions and of the fitted beta distributions were very similar for all three catchments fig 10 this is interesting considering the proportional greater role of snowmelt in la vizza compared to the two other catchments section 4 1 suggesting that snowmelt might affect the amount of streamflow hence the size of runoff coefficients but not their overall probability distribution 4 2 2 main factors influencing the hydrological response the multiple regression models confirmed that the same factors among those we considered although with different statistical relevance controlled streamflow generation during rainfall runoff events at the different spatial scales total event rainfall proved to be the most important predictor of all four considered metrics of streamflow response in the three study catchments fig 11 this behaviour is not surprising given the well documented role of rainfall depth in explaining the variability of streamflow response in mountain catchments not necessarily located in dolomitic regions e g inamdar and mitchell 2007 lana renault et al 2007 l√≥pez taraz√≥n et al 2010 rodr√≠guez blanco et al 2012 2019 penna et al 2015b nadal romero et al 2018 the role of rainfall was mainly assessed in terms of runoff coefficients in alpine catchments both as total event rainfall merz et al 2006 tarasova et al 2018 and of mean annual precipitation norbiato et al 2009 storm duration proved to be another strong indicator of the streamflow response for all three catchments as typically related to total event rainfall depth l√≥pez taraz√≥n et al 2010 nadal romero et al 2018 antecedent precipitation considered as a proxy of catchment antecedent wetness conditions contributed to explain the variability of runoff coefficients stormflow and peak streamflow but not lag times for all three catchments particularly in the range of 3 9 days fig 11 interestingly napi1 and napi10 to napi12 were not predictors of streamflow response in any of the three catchments when all the 203 events were considered this suggests that rainfall that has fallen the day before a given rainfall runoff event may exert a limited influence on the runoff production possibly due to the reduced time to reach deeper subsurface storages and contribute to subsurface flow but also to the possible lack of precipitation the day before a given event analogously rainfall fallen later than 10 days before a given rainfall runoff event seems to play a negligible impact on streamflow response however these results should be taken with caution because napi greater than 10 days explained part of the variability of streamflow response when only 42 events and so in a less robust way were considered fig 11 right column antecedent precipitation appears to explain part of the variability of streamflow generation with similar relevance for all the three catchments except stormflow at saviner multiple regression analysis for the 42 events for which antecedent soil moisture and depth to water table measurements at bcc were available confirmed the dominant role of rainfall depth on all metrics of streamflow response for all catchments but the influence of wetness conditions was generally better represented by napis than the actual soil moisture data moreover antecedent depth to water table was a significant predictor only on one occasion lag time at bcc fig s2 right panel the limited role of antecedent soil moisture to explain the variability in the metrics of streamflow response is partly in contrast with the crucial role of antecedent moisture conditions on runoff generation in mountain catchments observed in many studies e g brocca et al 2009 james and roulet 2009 tramblay et al 2010 zehe et al 2010 penna et al 2011 tayfur et al 2014 massari et al 2014 in some cases with a higher degree of importance compared to event rainfall e g merz and bl√∂schl 2009 uber et al 2018 nonetheless less experimental work has been carried out on the variation of the influence of antecedent soil moisture on runoff at increasing spatial scales for instance james and roulet 2009 found different magnitudes of streamflow response with dry or wet antecedent conditions in eight small nested catchments ranging in size from 7 to 147 ha but found no scaling in the percent of new water delivery with catchment area under either wet or dry antecedent conditions graeff et al 2012 focused on the prediction of event based runoff coefficients in nested catchments up to an area of 50 km2 and found that the predictive performance of the applied soil moisture based generalized linear model decreased with increasing catchment size however their analysis did not show any significantly distinct role of antecedent wetness conditions on streamflow response as a function of increasing spatial scales analogously our analysis revealed comparable importance of antecedent precipitation after total rainfall and storm duration on runoff coefficients and peak streamflow and partly stormflow among the three considered spatial scales with no evident differences in its statistical significance among the three catchments napi always much lower than 0 01 fig 11 in addition the multiple regression analysis on 42 events revealed that local antecedent soil moisture and water table data collected in bcc cannot be assumed as representative for subsurface processes occurring at the large spatial scales probably due to the less homogeneous soils and land cover in la vizza and saviner table 1 finally rainfall intensity played a minor role on the variability of the hydrological response of the three study catchments although statistically significant maximum rainfall intensity entered the multiple regression model in later steps compared to other predictors such as rainfall depth storm duration and napi and not for all metrics of streamflow response more often for stormflow and lag times and all catchments fig 11 and fig s2 previous studies in other mountain catchments characterized by different geological settings showed a relevant role of rainfall intensity on runoff generation e g blume et al 2007 graeff et al 2012 tarasova et al 2018 but other research reported weak direct relation between runoff coefficient and maximum rainfall intensity rodr√≠guez blanco et al 2012 or even inverse relations merz and bl√∂schl 2009 indicating a role of rainfall intensity depending on site specific conditions 5 conclusions the current context of climate change and the widespread concern about water supply calls for a better understanding of streamflow generation in mesoscale catchments which typically represent the management scale and of how streamflow of mesoscale catchments compares to that of small catchments which are easier to equip and to monitor in detail in this perspective our multi year analysis in three nested catchments in the italian dolomites contributed to highlight the complex interactions of the drivers of streamflow variability at different spatial scales in mountain settings the higher specific streamflow stormflow volumes runoff coefficients and peak streamflow values observed at the smaller scale with respect to the damped response at the larger scales reflected the steep topography and the shallow soil of the first order catchment however we did not test the possible effect of different vegetation cover and land use and the runoff buffer effect related to deeper soils and larger storage in the larger catchment curiously there was not a distinct pattern in lag times with increasing spatial scales suggesting that other factors drove the response time in the study catchments similar probability distributions of runoff coefficients at all scales and multiple regression analysis indicate that the same main factors namely total rainfall event storm duration and antecedent conditions controlled the variability of runoff coefficients stormflow volumes and streamflow peaks irrespectively of the catchment size this is promising for prediction purposes because suggests the possible application of scaling factors to relate hydrological response at different scales however local conditions e g snowmelt subsurface flow and other drivers e g rainfall intensity were important for one or few metrics of streamflow response only e g lag time and for a single catchment indicating that other factors must contribute to the total observed temporal variability of streamflow in the study catchments particularly the snowmelt contribution on streamflow during late spring and early summer was important for the intermediate size catchment featuring the largest proportion of high elevation areas this observation stresses the vulnerability of cryogenic derived water resources in the context of projected lower snow accumulation in high elevation mountain regions moreover hydrological variables measured in the first order catchment were not always significant indicators of streamflow responses at the larger scales further research that can build on these findings is necessary to investigate under which conditions streamflow generates in first order and small catchments and can provide reliable indications on the hydrological response of larger catchments in dolomitic environments conflict of interest none

6733,understanding how catchment streamflow response varies in time and at different spatial scales is critical to assess runoff production and water availability in mountain areas very little work on comparing runoff generation processes in catchments of increasing size has been done in dolomitic areas in this research we adopted a nested catchment 0 14 109 km2 approach to i assess whether and how streamflow response at the seasonal and the rainfall runoff event time scale varies with increasing spatial scale and ii identify the main factors controlling the temporal variability of streamflow response in three mountain catchments in the italian dolomites we used precipitation and streamflow data from june to september of 13 consecutive years 2005 2017 available for all three catchments and computed runoff coefficients stormflow volumes streamflow peaks and lag times between the rainfall centroid and the streamflow peak for 203 rainfall runoff events occurred during the study period results show that overall specific streamflow and runoff coefficients decreased with the increasing spatial scale however this pattern was disrupted at the end of spring beginning of summer due to the relevant snowmelt contribution to streamflow in the intermediate catchment characterized by the largest fraction of high elevation areas where deep snowpack accumulated during the winter the probability distribution of runoff coefficients was very well represented by a beta distribution for all three catchments suggesting that analogous factors controlled the variability of runoff coefficients this was confirmed by multiple regression analysis that revealed that event rainfall amount storm duration and 3 12 days antecedent precipitation assumed as a proxy for antecedent wetness conditions explained up to 0 81 of the variability of streamflow response with a minor role of rainfall intensity further research is needed to assess whether detailed measurements of hydrological variables collected at the small catchment scale 1 km2 could be deemed as representative for the hydrological response of larger catchments keywords streamflow response mountain catchments multiple spatial scales runoff coefficient streamflow peak antecedent precipitation 1 introduction streamflow response within and among catchments is highly variable through time and space zimmer and gannon 2018 land use and land cover modifications are among the main relevant drivers of streamflow dynamics woldesenbet et al 2018 these changes interact with hydroclimatic forcing such as antecedent conditions and rainfall characteristics and other physical variables such as soil properties and topography and contribute to large spatio temporal variabilities in streamflow generation rodr√≠guez blanco et al 2012 nippgen et al 2016 investigating these spatio temporal variabilities and their controlling factors is essential to better understand the hydrological functioning of catchments ares et al 2018 and to obtain a deeper knowledge of water availability for people and ecosystems this is particularly critical in mountain catchments as they provide freshwater for many people living in downstream areas and habitats for a high number of animal and plant species schmeller et al 2018 streamflow response in mountain catchments is more difficult to understand compared to lowland areas as runoff flow pathways are influenced by bedrock permeability highly variable topography and soil depth zhang et al 2018 zuecco et al 2018 due to the large spatial heterogeneity in landscape characteristics of mountain regions process oriented studies are often conducted in small typically 10 km2 headwater catchments where hydroclimatic forcing and bio geophysical characteristics are less heterogeneous zimmer and gannon 2018 detailed measurements of hydrological processes especially in mountain areas are thus usually obtained in small experimental headwater or low order catchments mcglynn et al 2013 gregoretti et al 2016 llorens et al 2018 van meerveld et al 2018 zuecco et al 2018 however water resource planning and management are most often carried out in mesoscale catchments 100 km2 e g soulsby et al 2003 2004 melland et al 2018 therefore a better understanding on how streamflow response varies from small to large spatial scales in mountain settings is pivotal to support land and water management decisions however linking similarities between water fluxes across small and mesoscale catchments is difficult because spatial heterogeneity in landscape characteristics increases with catchment size hampering the distinction of complex relationships and feedbacks between runoff controls troch et al 2015 zimmer and gannon 2018 moreover because dominant flow pathways may vary among nearby tributaries different runoff responses can alter the presence absence or detection of scaling effects sidle et al 2017 thus upscaling process understanding achieved in small experimental catchments to larger scales is still challenging shaman et al 2004 soulsby et al 2006 sidle 2006 sidle et al 2017 a few studies have analysed the streamflow response at increasing spatial scales from small to mesoscale catchments in mountain regions for instance soulsby et al 2003 used tracer based hydrograph separation techniques to investigate changes in runoff processes with landscape characteristics in different subcatchments of the feugh catchment scotland ranging in size from 1 to 233 km2 they found that overland flow and shallow subsurface stormflow were the dominant contributors to storm runoff with groundwater contribution to annual runoff ranging between 30 and 60 in the smallest and larger catchments respectively soulsby et al 2003 in a follow up study in the same area soulsby et al 2004 used a combination of hydrometric and hydrochemical data collected over a hydrological year to assess the usefulness of tracers in upscaling flow path understanding they related the observed degree of variation in streamflow to geology land cover and soil properties the applied tracers indicated the rate of groundwater recharge the geochemistry of groundwater storages and the influence of peat acidic soils in storm runoff generation and catchment recession soulsby et al 2004 didszun and uhlenbrook 2008 analysed low flow stream chemistry and rainfall event response in nested catchments ranging in size from 0 015 to 258 km2 in the black forest mountains germany to assess how the fundamental runoff generation mechanisms changed with spatial scale they found that small catchments less than 1 2 km2 were non representative for runoff generation in larger catchments due to the topographic structure and a reduced number of runoff components they also saw that in catchments larger than 40 km2 surface runoff from urban areas became increasingly important moreover small differences in the tracer signature in catchments between 1 and 40 km2 were found suggesting that tracers can provide detailed information into the scaling of the main runoff mechanisms didszun and uhlenbrook 2008 zillgens et al 2007 examined 201 rainfall runoff events in three nested catchments of the austrian alps of 0 07 15 and 150 km2 to comprehend how hydrological processes were related across different spatial scales their results showed that two types of runoff events existed at the three scales viz a unimodal event type with a quick rising and falling hydrograph and a bimodal event type with a double peak hydrograph they observed that in all cases where a bimodal event occurred at the microscale the hydrographs at the larger scales showed damped recessions and that the bimodal events were characterized by much higher runoff volumes than the unimodal events at all scales they found that the occurrence of the two event types was consistent over three orders of catchment size and concluded that the runoff behaviour of the headwater may be used as an indicator of the runoff behaviour of much larger areas zillgens et al 2007 richardson et al 2012 investigated the daily streamflow dynamics in six catchments in a peatland complex in ontario canada ranging in size from 8 to 200 km2 they found that during high flow periods runoff production increased with catchment area up to 50 km2 and then declined with further increases in catchment size up to 200 km2 but that during low flow periods runoff production did not change consistently across scales in the end they argued that the observed differences in runoff generation were controlled by differences in the size and geomorphologic properties of wet prone near streams zones richardson et al 2012 finally recent findings by wilkinson and bathurst 2018 investigated the relationship between rainfall spatial variability and runoff response over spatial scales from 1 1 to 2286 km2 in the eden catchment uk they observed that peak specific streamflow for winter events remained fairly constant with area of up to 20 30 km2 corresponding to the main upland headwater catchments thereafter decreasing with the increasing size the runoff response to convective storms depended on the rainfall position and peak discharge varied significantly from the winter storms moreover they derived an average scaling law for peak discharge for large synoptic storms revealing the non linear nature of the cross scale variations wilkinson and bathurst 2018 as these examples demonstrate there is a certain amount of research on comparing streamflow dynamics across different spatial scales particularly some studies were carried out following the nested catchment approach that can provide valuable information into hydrological functioning at different scales sidle et al 2017 because it shows how catchment scale processes and their distribution reflect changes in water fluxes and propagate downstream ebel and mirus 2014 penna et al 2017b however to the best of our knowledge no study has been performed in high elevation dolomitic regions where snowmelt is an important water input in addition to rainfall events and where karst features may hide water and release it with different timing compared to catchments lying on a less fractured substratum in this study we analysed streamflow response at the monthly and rainfall runoff event timescale during the summer months in a gauged dolomitic nested catchment in the italian alps ranging in size from less than 1 km2 to more than 100 km2 our working hypothesis is that specific streamflow decreases in magnitude with the increasing spatial scale but that streamflow dynamics and hydrological processes observed in the first order catchment are representative for processes observed in the mesoscale catchment particularly our study aims to answer the following research questions i how does the catchment streamflow response during the summer months and the rainfall runoff event timescale vary with the increase in spatial scale ii what are the main controls on the temporal variability of streamflow response at different spatial scales in nested alpine catchments 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the upper cordevole river basin italian dolomites eastern alps fig 1 and includes three nested catchments bridge creek catchment bcc 0 14 km2 cordevole catchment at la vizza 7 3 km2 and cordevole catchment at saviner 109 km2 the main land cover consists of alpine grassland and its fraction area decreases as a function of elevation and with increasing catchment area table 1 subvertical dolomitic rock cliffs dolomia principale formation can be found in the upper part of la vizza and saviner catchments dolomia cassiana dolomite and san cassiano formations carbonate and terrigenous sandstones and claystones constitute the lithology of bcc and the main lithologies of la vizza penna et al 2017b zuecco et al 2018 downstream in the cordevole catchment lithology changes to formations of clastic deposits mainly conglomerates and sandstones upper middle triassic alternated with limestones sometimes with evaporitic rocks lower triassic soils presenting silicatic siltic parent material are moderately deep with acid reaction and a good drainage capacity soil type distribution is quite similar across the three catchments slopes are characterised by the presence of leptsols in the steeper areas and cambisols where slopes are gentler while the valley bottom shows also the presence of luvisols with a higher differentiation between soil layers the hypsometric curves of la vizza and saviner have similar shapes while the hypsometric curve of bcc is more regular spanning a smaller range of elevations compared to the two other catchments table 1 and fig 2 particularly la vizza has the highest mean elevation and about 25 of its area is above 2500 m a s l and more than 90 is above 2000 m a s l fig 2 the high elevations table 1 and the geographical location in the internal portion of the southern alps determine that approximately half of the mean annual precipitation on average 1220 mm per year at bcc and la vizza falls as snow while average monthly temperatures have a minimum of 5 7 c in january and a maximum of 14 1 c in july bcc and la vizza snowfalls generally occur from late october to april and rarely in may june and september snowmelt starts in march and lasts few weeks in bcc due to the homogeneous aspect of the catchment south east oriented table 1 while at la vizza and saviner snowmelt can last until july because of the high elevations and the more heterogeneous aspect of the hillslopes from june to september most precipitation falls as rain table 2 maximum average rainfall depth occurs in august due to frequent storms while the minimum is in september 2 2 hydrometeorological data the study period includes data from june to september the period with negligible or the lowest snow cover of 13 successive years 2005 2017 precipitation and air temperature were measured all year round by heated tipping buckets and temperature sensors located at different elevations fig 1 and operated by the agency for environmental protection of veneto region arpav for bcc we interpolated precipitation data from the arabba 1645 m a s l and pordoi pass 2155 m a s l stations using the inverse distance weighted method penna et al 2017b for la vizza catchment we used precipitation data from the pordoi pass station for saviner catchment we used thiessen polygons to interpolate precipitation measured at five stations with elevations ranging from 1007 to 2155 m a s l continuous streamflow measurements at the outlet are available for all catchments table 3 except for bcc data are provided by arpav in bcc water stage is measured by a pressure transducer behind a v notch weir and it is converted to streamflow based on the weir equation at la vizza outlet water stage is measured by a transducer installed behind a v notch weir while an ultrasonic gauging system is used at saviner outlet water stages in la vizza and saviner are converted to streamflow by rating curves developed and checked by arpav in addition soil moisture was measured continuously at a 15 min interval during june october 2010 2013 at six different locations at 5 20 and 40 cm depth in a riparian hillslope transect in bcc penna et al 2016 zuecco et al 2018 in this study we used hillslope averaged antecedent soil moisture at 5 and 30 cm average between 20 and 40 cm considered representative for the soil moisture conditions of bcc hillslopes penna et al 2011 to assess whether antecedent wetness conditions controlled the streamflow response during the rainfall runoff events depth to water table was measured continuously at a 15 min interval in piezometers located in the riparian zone and the hillslopes in bcc penna et al 2015a zuecco et al 2019b due to the damage caused by avalanches during the snowmelt period the network of piezometers changed throughout the years zuecco et al 2018 therefore in this study we considered only depth to water table measured in a piezometer in the riparian zone p17 and one in the mid hillslope m12 in the period june september 2011 2013 installation depths were 0 60 and 1 60 m from the soil surface for p17 and m12 respectively 2 3 data analysis rainfall runoff event characteristics were used to compare the streamflow response in the three study catchments rainfall runoff events that were included in the analysis occurred in the period june september from 2005 to 2017 and they were selected according to the following conditions a a total event precipitation equal or larger than 5 mm b two events were separated by at least 6 h with no precipitation penna et al 2011 zuecco et al 2019b c a minimum difference of 0 01 mm h between peak and pre event specific streamflow at the three outlets d a rainfall onset within three hours in all the three catchments for each rainfall runoff event we computed several predictors of the event streamflow response i e total event rainfall mean and maximum rainfall intensity storm duration normalized antecedent precipitation index up to 12 days hillslope averaged antecedent soil moisture at 5 and 30 cm depth in bcc and antecedent water table at the two piezometers in bcc table 4 and four event streamflow metrics i e runoff coefficient stormflow volume peak streamflow lag time between the rainfall centroid and the streamflow peak table 5 stormflow volumes were determined using the constant k method of blume et al 2007 specific streamflow i e streamflow per catchment area is reported throughout the paper for catchment comparison purposes in this work we quantified antecedent precipitation computing the normalized antecedent precipitation index napi proposed by heggen 2001 this index includes antecedent precipitation for the very day of a given event and considers a normalization to the rain gauge mean and to the antecedent series length napi is defined as 1 napi t 0 i p t k t p t 1 i k t where i is the series length days p t is the precipitation at the day t and p is the average daily precipitation decay coefficient k is a catchment and seasonal parameter that generally ranges between 0 80 and 0 98 viessman and lewis 1996 here we adopted the midrange value of 0 90 as suggested by heggen 2001 the lag time between rainfall input and streamflow output is an important indicator of the catchment hydrological properties and provides useful insights to understand streamflow generation processes haga et al 2005 asano and uchida 2018 here we computed the lag time centroid lag to peak dingman 2002 as the time difference in hours between the streamflow peak and the rainfall centroid for each event the temporal variability in runoff coefficients was analysed fitting beta distributions to the cumulative distribution functions of runoff coefficients of each catchment individually merz et al 2006 the beta cumulative distribution function is given by 2 f x Œ± Œ≤ 1 b Œ± Œ≤ 0 1 x Œ± 1 1 x Œ≤ 1 d x where x is the event runoff coefficient b Œ± Œ≤ is the beta function and Œ± and Œ≤ are the shape parameters of the beta distribution the cumulative distribution function of the beta distribution was fitted by minimising the root mean squared differences rmse between the empirical and the fitted cumulative distribution functions 95 confidence intervals of the Œ± and Œ≤ parameters were also computed in order to determine the most important predictors of the four metrics of streamflow response in the three study catchments we used a forward stepwise multiple linear regression e g mcintyre et al 2007 l√≥pez taraz√≥n et al 2010 taguas et al 2017 lacombe et al 2018 rodr√≠guez blanco et al 2019 we included all predictors variables in the models that were significant with p 0 05 for each multiple linear regression model we show the different steps with the selected predictors and their significance p values the adjusted r2 and the mean squared errors mse fig 11 and fig s2 the multiple regression analysis was carried out for the 203 selected rainfall runoff events and on a subset of 42 rainfall runoff events for which soil moisture and depth to water table data were available fig 11 and fig s2 to determine whether snowmelt affected runoff generation during late spring early summer we quantified the snow cover area sca in the three catchments over the years 2005 2017 we computed monthly average values of sca based on the modis aqua sensor we preferred not to use sca data at higher temporal resolution due to the documented possible lower resolution in forested areas e g parajka et al 2012 gascoin et al 2015 compared to forest free terrain values of sca were obtained from myd10a1 006 aqua snow cover daily global 500 m hall and riggs

quality are 0 best 1 good 2 ok 3 poor not currently in use images with an average data quality value over 0 5 on a per catchment basiswere excluded from the analysis 3 results 3 1 seasonal variability in streamflow and precipitation the three study catchments did not have a statistically different monthly mean precipitation depth in the june september period over the study years table 2 kruskal wallis one way analysis of variance p 0 05 june and july had almost the same precipitation depth while august was the month with the highest precipitation depth due to the frequent summer storms the lowest precipitation depth was observed in september a month also characterized by rare snowfall producing a thin snowpack that immediately melts the time averaged hydrograph 2005 2017 for the june september period shows overall consistent temporal patterns of the precipitation runoff relation in the three catchments with a good visual agreement in the streamflow response to precipitation inputs fig 3 however la vizza in june was characterized by much higher flows compared to bcc and saviner fig 3 and table 3 and bcc in august and especially in september showed higher flows compared to the two other catchments fig 3 higher flows in la vizza compared to bcc were also evident in the range of 0 04 0 3 of exceedance probability whereas the highest streamflow values with very low exceedance probability were recorded for bcc and likely related to intense rainfall events fig 4 mean and median specific streamflow decreased with the increasing catchment area except during the high flow period in june for la vizza table 3 and fig 3 we relate these late spring early summer high flows in la vizza to snowmelt still occurring in high elevation areas which are proportionally larger in la vizza compared to the two other catchments fig 2 by early mid july specific streamflow in la vizza and saviner markedly decreased indicating a depleting snowmelt source fig 3 and from that time onward streamflow in bcc remained constantly higher than in the two other catchments indeed the modis based analysis of monthly change in sca reveals an important reduction in sca between may and june that was particularly marked for la vizza catchment fig 5 this indicates that the snow areal depletion in la vizza was highest leading to larger snowmelt inputs in this catchment compared to bcc and saviner as a result of these dynamics the interannual variability in streamflow shaded bands in fig 3 the monthly streamflow range maximum minimum and the streamflow variability expressed by the coefficient of variation were larger in la vizza and bcc than in saviner and overall for the three sites coefficients of variations were higher in july and august table 3 fig 6 shows examples of june september hydrographs in years characterized by different snow accumulation during winter all the three catchments exhibited a marked interannual variability in streamflow especially in june reflecting the variability in meteorological forcing low streamflow values were observed in june 2015 due to a scarce snow accumulation during the 2014 2015 winter and the following spring while moderately high streamflow was evident in june 2016 due to a moderate snow accumulation during the winter see caption of fig 6 for sca values higher streamflow values were recorded in june 2011 when the catchments were characterized by similar sca with respect to june 2016 because of important precipitation inputs and thus the occurrence of rain on snow events high streamflow at la vizza and saviner were also observed during june 2014 a period characterized by very low precipitation but following high snow accumulation during winter 2013 2014 and spring 2014 conversely low baseflow was found in bcc in june 2014 due to a scarcity of rainfall events compared to 2015 2016 and 2011 fig 6 the double mass curves built for the entire observation period fig s1 clearly show a decrease in specific streamflow with increasing spatial scale more interesting the shape of the monthly double mass curves grouped per month fig 7 reflects the averaged hydrographs fig 3 in june cumulative streamflow in la vizza was higher than the precipitation input fig 6 slope 1 as a result of the notable snowmelt inputs in the following months the slope of the double mass curve of la vizza decreased and it was between the double mass curves of bcc and saviner saviner had the double mass curve with the lowest slope except in june when late snowmelt determined a slope of the curve very similar to the one obtained for bcc the double mass curves of bcc had the largest slope except in june compared to la vizza and saviner remarkably in september the cumulative streamflow in bcc exceeded the cumulative precipitation fig 7 slope 1 indicating that streamflow was sustained by other water sources in addition to precipitation 3 2 seasonal variability at the rainfall runoff event scale the 203 selected rainfall runoff events had similar characteristics in the three catchments in terms of total event rainfall storm duration napi and lag time kruskal wallis one way analysis of variance p 0 05 table 4 and table 5 conversely there were significant differences in mean and maximum rainfall intensity with larger intensities in la vizza than in bcc and saviner and in three hydrological response metrics i e peak streamflow stormflow and runoff coefficient kruskal wallis one way analysis of variance p 0 05 in bcc and la vizza peak streamflow stormflow and runoff coefficients were similar but significantly larger than in saviner dunn multiple comparison test p 0 05 table 5 the temporal variability in runoff coefficients decreased with the increasing spatial scale fig 8 runoff coefficients were particularly variable in time in bcc in june and august while they had small variations in saviner especially in july at the monthly scale runoff coefficients in saviner were significantly different and smaller than in bcc and la vizza dunn multiple comparison test p 0 05 in la vizza runoff coefficients were less variable in time and generally smaller compared to bcc except in july but there was not a significant difference at the monthly scale between runoff coefficients in the two catchments dunn multiple comparison test p 0 05 the scatterplots between runoff coefficients in different catchments confirmed that rainfall runoff events in la vizza had runoff coefficients always larger than in saviner except for few events occurring mostly in june and july fig 9 overall there was not a clear distinction of runoff coefficients based on the months although bcc had some runoff coefficients smaller than la vizza and saviner concentrated in july and august the relation between runoff coefficients in bcc and la vizza had a slope close to 1 but it was less clear for very low runoff coefficients approximately 0 1 probably because of large differences in total event rainfall or stormflow measured in the two catchments 3 3 statistical analysis of streamflow response 3 3 1 beta distribution beta distributions fitted very well the empirical cumulative distributions of the runoff coefficients in the three catchments visual inspection of fig 10 as also indicated by the very low values of rmse 0 002 0 0002 and 0 005 for bcc la vizza and saviner respectively the Œ± parameters of the fitted beta distributions were 1 03 95 confidence interval 0 82 1 29 2 12 95 confidence interval 1 76 2 54 and 1 99 95 confidence interval 1 56 2 54 for bcc la vizza and saviner respectively the Œ≤ parameters were 9 1 95 confidence interval 7 3 11 3 25 5 95 confidence interval 21 1 30 7 and 42 7 95 confidence interval 35 1 51 9 for bcc la vizza and saviner respectively while the Œ± parameters were quite similar in la vizza and saviner and larger than the Œ± parameter obtained for bcc the Œ≤ parameters increased with the increasing area of the catchments and generally were one order of magnitude larger than the Œ± parameters furthermore a seasonal pattern in the empirical cumulative distributions of the runoff coefficients was not identified in the three catchments because rainfall runoff events with small and large runoff coefficients were almost equally distributed in the four study months inset of fig 10 3 3 2 multiple regression analysis the multiple linear regression analysis for the 203 and the 42 rainfall runoff events shows that all the statistical models used to predict the four metrics of streamflow response in the three study catchments were highly significant fig 11 and fig s2 however the amount of variation in the response metric explained by the predictors varied when considering the different statistical models and the catchments for instance the regressions explaining the variability in stormflow for the 203 events had the largest adjusted determination coefficients 0 81 0 75 and 0 80 for bcc la vizza and saviner respectively fig 11 left column while the lowest efficiency was found for the models explaining the lag time adjusted r2 was 0 52 0 14 and 0 40 for bcc la vizza and saviner respectively fig s2 left panel overall the statistical models performed better for bcc than the larger spatial scales la vizza and saviner the best multiple linear models were identified with a minimum of two steps and predictors for lag time in la vizza and saviner fig s2 left panel and a maximum of six steps and predictors for peak streamflow in la vizza fig 11 left column total event rainfall was the only predictor present in all multiple linear regression models for all three catchments it entered the models usually during step 1 had a high significance p 0 001 and explained most of the variability fig 11 left column storm duration was the second most important predictor entering the models during step 1 to explain runoff coefficient in bcc and saviner and in step 2 to predict stormflow and lag time in bcc and saviner fig 11 left column however storm duration was a less important independent variable in the models predicting the response metrics in la vizza e g storm duration was not significant p 0 05 in the models explaining stormflow and lag time napis and maximum and mean rainfall intensity were also identified as significant predictors but they were usually less significant and important than total event rainfall and storm duration napi3 and 9 were the napis occurring more often in the statistical models while napi10 12 were not significant in any of the multiple linear regressions fig 11 left column the application of the stepwise multiple linear regression to a subset of 42 rainfall runoff events for which antecedent soil moisture and depth to water table data were available at bcc confirmed the relevant role of total event rainfall in explaining all metrics of streamflow response in the three catchments it entered the models during step 1 or 2 explaining most of the adjusted r2 fig 11 right column and fig s2 right panel conversely storm duration was a less important predictor compared to the regressions determined using all the 203 rainfall runoff events antecedent soil moisture and depth to water table were not able to capture the same or more variability in the metrics of streamflow response compared to napi1 12 fig 11 right column and fig s2 right panel indeed hillslope averaged antecedent soil moisture at 5 cm depth was a significant predictor of runoff coefficient in bcc p 0 005 and saviner p 0 05 and stormflow in bcc p 0 01 hillslope averaged antecedent soil moisture at 30 cm depth was a significant predictor only of peak streamflow in saviner p 0 05 while the antecedent depth to water table at piezometer p17 was a significant predictor only of lag time in bcc p 0 05 for this subset of 42 rainfall runoff events the most significant napis were found for a number of days larger than 8 showing therefore important differences in the napi predictors compared to the regression models obtained using the larger dataset fig 11 4 discussion 4 1 variability of streamflow response with increasing spatial scales streamflow response at different catchment scales especially in mountain catchments is typically characterized by a marked variability controlled by various drivers often combined the results of this study for three alpine catchments in the italian dolomites confirm this behaviour our analysis clearly indicates that specific streamflow decreased with the increasing catchment size during the summer months not affected by snowmelt figs 3 and 4 the same was observed for peak streamflow stormflow and runoff coefficients for the selected rainfall runoff events table 5 and fig 8 this reactive behaviour is consistent with what was observed in other multi scale studies soulsby et al 2003 zillgens et al 2007 richardson et al 2012 wilkinson and bathurst 2018 and appears not to be specifically related to dolomitic catchments as small headwater catchments incorporate proportionally larger areas of high runoff production with respect to less runoff productive lowland areas wilkinson and bathurst 2018 independently from the geological setting this is mainly due to the high slope table 1 and shallow soils in bcc that lead to rapid formation of lateral subsurface flow greatly contributing to stream runoff penna et al 2015a 2016 zuecco et al 2019b in addition the damped streamflow response of saviner could be attributed to the assumed larger storage typically varying with catchment size richardson et al 2012 creutzfeldt et al 2014 pfister et al 2017 and the higher buffer capability of large riparian areas with deeper soils found in larger catchments however we did not compute the storage for the three study catchments because hydrological data for bcc were available only for four months of the year moreover the different streamflow responses could be related to the increasingly important role of evapotranspiration at la vizza and saviner over bcc due to their proportionally larger areas covered with shrubs and forests table 1 however evapotranspiration data are currently not available for the study areas further analyses are advisable to test the role of storage and evapotranspiration fluxes on the decreasing hydrological response with increasing spatial scale in the upper cordevole river basin lag times generally increase with increasing catchment size and decreasing topographic gradient since the distance to the catchment outlet and therefore the travel time increase montgomery and dietrich 2002 wilkinson and bathurst 2018 moreover lag times are controlled by runoff processes on hillslopes and by channel routing as the topography of first order catchments is composed mostly of steep hillslopes and channel networks asano and uchida 2018 additional controls on catchment response times were identified in the main flow path length channel slope channel roughness relative relief catchment concavity and shape howard 1990 gericke and smithers 2014 and references therein as a result of these different and often combined effects large variabilities in catchment response time were documented for instance wilkinson and bathurst 2018 found marked temporal shifts in the streamflow response at larger scales up to roughly 16 h although their study catchments in uk were overall larger than those investigated here in our case we did not find any relation between lag times and catchment scale lag times for the 203 analysed events were slightly shorter for la vizza the intermediate catchment but there was no statistically significant difference among the three catchments table 5 these results are in agreement with the findings by didszun and uhlenbrook 2008 who showed small and similar lag times for 13 german catchments with a size comparable to that of the catchments reported in our study we have no strong evidence to support a plausible explanation of similar lag times in the three study catchments in addition to possible topographic controls we hypothesize that this behaviour might be related to the inclusion in the computation of mean lag times of rainfall events characterized by possible influence of snowmelt only in the upper catchments and of short convective rainfall events and long autumn like precipitation events these latter two potentially characterized by much different lag times however further specific analyses should be carried out to better investigate the causes of this behaviour an evident difference in mean specific streamflow was observed in late spring early summer when la vizza showed higher flows compared to the two other catchments fig 3 the lack of difference in precipitation depth for the three catchments table 2 the much larger fractions of areas at high elevation above 2600 m a s l for la vizza fig 2 and the more marked difference in specific streamflow between la vizza and the other catchments in years with moderate to high snow accumulation e g 2014 and 2016 see fig 6 clearly indicate the significant role of snowmelt on the hydrological response of this catchment this confirms the importance of snow derived meltwater in alpine catchments e g kobierska et al 2013 engel et al 2016 schmieder et al 2016 penna et al 2017a zuecco et al 2019a especially in karst areas of the alps finger et al 2013 generally from mid july onward e g at the end of the melting season streamflow at bcc was consistently higher than at la vizza and saviner figs 3 and 4 and interestingly in september the cumulative streamflow in bcc exceeded the cumulative precipitation slope 1 in fig 7 this observation indicates that another water source in addition to rainfall and snowmelt must exist in bcc to feed the stream also during baseflow conditions we attribute this behaviour to the contribution of shallow subsurface flow in agreement with previous field observations on the presence of perennial springs at bcc one of which discharges relatively high flows to the bridge creek and tracer based quantification of pre event water and on the role of hillslope shallow groundwater to stream runoff camporese et al 2014 penna et al 2015a 2016 zuecco et al 2019b the role of the perennial spring in sustaining streamflow during baseflow conditions is consistent with the results about the importance of springs in controlling the extent of flow in other mountain catchments guida et al 2016 lovill et al 2018 especially in karst regions hu et al 2015 4 2 main controls on the temporal variability of streamflow response 4 2 1 distribution of runoff coefficients the event runoff coefficient is a key concept in catchment hydrology and can be used as a diagnostic metric to describe streamflow generation in catchments merz et al 2006 our results showed that the empirical distribution of runoff coefficients in the three study alpine catchments was very well fitted by a beta distribution fig 10 with rmses even smaller than the low ones reported by merz et al 2006 for 337 austrian catchments this excellent fit also agrees with the findings by gottschalk and weingartner 1998 for a group of alpine catchments in switzerland but in their case runoff coefficients were generally smaller 0 2 compared to our study sites due to the relatively small part of the high elevation catchments that was active in quick runoff generation the large differences observed between the Œ± and Œ≤ parameters of the fitted beta distributions for the three study catchments indicate that the distributions of the runoff coefficients were highly skewed to the right merz et al 2006 due to the large frequencies of small runoff coefficients the increase of the Œ≤ parameter from bcc to la vizza to saviner reflects the increase in catchment size and the decrease of runoff coefficients figs 8 10 with differences in the runoff coefficients among the three sites particularly marked above the frequency of 0 6 fig 10 despite these differences the shapes of the cumulative distribution functions and of the fitted beta distributions were very similar for all three catchments fig 10 this is interesting considering the proportional greater role of snowmelt in la vizza compared to the two other catchments section 4 1 suggesting that snowmelt might affect the amount of streamflow hence the size of runoff coefficients but not their overall probability distribution 4 2 2 main factors influencing the hydrological response the multiple regression models confirmed that the same factors among those we considered although with different statistical relevance controlled streamflow generation during rainfall runoff events at the different spatial scales total event rainfall proved to be the most important predictor of all four considered metrics of streamflow response in the three study catchments fig 11 this behaviour is not surprising given the well documented role of rainfall depth in explaining the variability of streamflow response in mountain catchments not necessarily located in dolomitic regions e g inamdar and mitchell 2007 lana renault et al 2007 l√≥pez taraz√≥n et al 2010 rodr√≠guez blanco et al 2012 2019 penna et al 2015b nadal romero et al 2018 the role of rainfall was mainly assessed in terms of runoff coefficients in alpine catchments both as total event rainfall merz et al 2006 tarasova et al 2018 and of mean annual precipitation norbiato et al 2009 storm duration proved to be another strong indicator of the streamflow response for all three catchments as typically related to total event rainfall depth l√≥pez taraz√≥n et al 2010 nadal romero et al 2018 antecedent precipitation considered as a proxy of catchment antecedent wetness conditions contributed to explain the variability of runoff coefficients stormflow and peak streamflow but not lag times for all three catchments particularly in the range of 3 9 days fig 11 interestingly napi1 and napi10 to napi12 were not predictors of streamflow response in any of the three catchments when all the 203 events were considered this suggests that rainfall that has fallen the day before a given rainfall runoff event may exert a limited influence on the runoff production possibly due to the reduced time to reach deeper subsurface storages and contribute to subsurface flow but also to the possible lack of precipitation the day before a given event analogously rainfall fallen later than 10 days before a given rainfall runoff event seems to play a negligible impact on streamflow response however these results should be taken with caution because napi greater than 10 days explained part of the variability of streamflow response when only 42 events and so in a less robust way were considered fig 11 right column antecedent precipitation appears to explain part of the variability of streamflow generation with similar relevance for all the three catchments except stormflow at saviner multiple regression analysis for the 42 events for which antecedent soil moisture and depth to water table measurements at bcc were available confirmed the dominant role of rainfall depth on all metrics of streamflow response for all catchments but the influence of wetness conditions was generally better represented by napis than the actual soil moisture data moreover antecedent depth to water table was a significant predictor only on one occasion lag time at bcc fig s2 right panel the limited role of antecedent soil moisture to explain the variability in the metrics of streamflow response is partly in contrast with the crucial role of antecedent moisture conditions on runoff generation in mountain catchments observed in many studies e g brocca et al 2009 james and roulet 2009 tramblay et al 2010 zehe et al 2010 penna et al 2011 tayfur et al 2014 massari et al 2014 in some cases with a higher degree of importance compared to event rainfall e g merz and bl√∂schl 2009 uber et al 2018 nonetheless less experimental work has been carried out on the variation of the influence of antecedent soil moisture on runoff at increasing spatial scales for instance james and roulet 2009 found different magnitudes of streamflow response with dry or wet antecedent conditions in eight small nested catchments ranging in size from 7 to 147 ha but found no scaling in the percent of new water delivery with catchment area under either wet or dry antecedent conditions graeff et al 2012 focused on the prediction of event based runoff coefficients in nested catchments up to an area of 50 km2 and found that the predictive performance of the applied soil moisture based generalized linear model decreased with increasing catchment size however their analysis did not show any significantly distinct role of antecedent wetness conditions on streamflow response as a function of increasing spatial scales analogously our analysis revealed comparable importance of antecedent precipitation after total rainfall and storm duration on runoff coefficients and peak streamflow and partly stormflow among the three considered spatial scales with no evident differences in its statistical significance among the three catchments napi always much lower than 0 01 fig 11 in addition the multiple regression analysis on 42 events revealed that local antecedent soil moisture and water table data collected in bcc cannot be assumed as representative for subsurface processes occurring at the large spatial scales probably due to the less homogeneous soils and land cover in la vizza and saviner table 1 finally rainfall intensity played a minor role on the variability of the hydrological response of the three study catchments although statistically significant maximum rainfall intensity entered the multiple regression model in later steps compared to other predictors such as rainfall depth storm duration and napi and not for all metrics of streamflow response more often for stormflow and lag times and all catchments fig 11 and fig s2 previous studies in other mountain catchments characterized by different geological settings showed a relevant role of rainfall intensity on runoff generation e g blume et al 2007 graeff et al 2012 tarasova et al 2018 but other research reported weak direct relation between runoff coefficient and maximum rainfall intensity rodr√≠guez blanco et al 2012 or even inverse relations merz and bl√∂schl 2009 indicating a role of rainfall intensity depending on site specific conditions 5 conclusions the current context of climate change and the widespread concern about water supply calls for a better understanding of streamflow generation in mesoscale catchments which typically represent the management scale and of how streamflow of mesoscale catchments compares to that of small catchments which are easier to equip and to monitor in detail in this perspective our multi year analysis in three nested catchments in the italian dolomites contributed to highlight the complex interactions of the drivers of streamflow variability at different spatial scales in mountain settings the higher specific streamflow stormflow volumes runoff coefficients and peak streamflow values observed at the smaller scale with respect to the damped response at the larger scales reflected the steep topography and the shallow soil of the first order catchment however we did not test the possible effect of different vegetation cover and land use and the runoff buffer effect related to deeper soils and larger storage in the larger catchment curiously there was not a distinct pattern in lag times with increasing spatial scales suggesting that other factors drove the response time in the study catchments similar probability distributions of runoff coefficients at all scales and multiple regression analysis indicate that the same main factors namely total rainfall event storm duration and antecedent conditions controlled the variability of runoff coefficients stormflow volumes and streamflow peaks irrespectively of the catchment size this is promising for prediction purposes because suggests the possible application of scaling factors to relate hydrological response at different scales however local conditions e g snowmelt subsurface flow and other drivers e g rainfall intensity were important for one or few metrics of streamflow response only e g lag time and for a single catchment indicating that other factors must contribute to the total observed temporal variability of streamflow in the study catchments particularly the snowmelt contribution on streamflow during late spring and early summer was important for the intermediate size catchment featuring the largest proportion of high elevation areas this observation stresses the vulnerability of cryogenic derived water resources in the context of projected lower snow accumulation in high elevation mountain regions moreover hydrological variables measured in the first order catchment were not always significant indicators of streamflow responses at the larger scales further research that can build on these findings is necessary to investigate under which conditions streamflow generates in first order and small catchments and can provide reliable indications on the hydrological response of larger catchments in dolomitic environments conflict of interest none

6734,rigorous validation of the first order detachment transport coupling concept using different sediment sizes is nonexistent in the literature we hypothesized that particle sizes in a sediment laden flow can affect soil detachment the objectives of this study were to investigate the relationship between detachment rates by rill flows and hydraulic parameters under low flow discharges and to quantify the responses of soil detachment rates to sediment loads and median sizes a concentrated flow flume test was conducted under three low flow discharges 0 00033 0 00067 and 0 00100 m2 s 1 and three sediment concentrations 50 100 and 200 kg m 3 with five median sizes 0 233 0 204 0 169 0 115 and 0 078 mm the results showed that the relationship between soil detachment capacity and shear stress fits the water erosion prediction project wepp model well r 2 0 89 stream power compared with shear stress is a better hydraulic parameter in simulating soil detachment rates under different sediment concentrations the soil detachment rates by sediment laden rill flows were negatively related to both sediment loads and sediment median sizes validating the first order sediment feedback relationships used in the wepp model the overall responses of soil detachment rates to sediment loads and sediment median sizes followed multivariate linear relationships further demonstrating the negative feedbacks of sediment load and size on soil detachment by rill flow keywords sediment load sediment median sizes rill detachment stream power shear stress low flow discharges 1 introduction concentrated flow is capable of detaching and transporting sediments from the soil mass soil detachment defined as the dislodgement of soil particles from the soil mass needs to be quantified in process based erosion models foster and meyer 1972 theoretically a given discharge of clear water on a certain slope can detach a maximum amount of soil defined as the detachment capacity d c the actual rate of detachment d r of a sediment laden flow will normally be lower than the detachment capacity as the maximum detachment can only occur with clear water that contains no sediments foster and meyer 1972 thus it is important to quantify the relationship between detachment rate and sediment load foster and meyer 1972 proposed a first order detachment transport coupling equation assuming that soil detachment only occurs when the sediment load g is less than transport capacity t c this equation is used as the governing equation in water erosion predict project wepp model as 1 d r d c 1 g t c where d r is the rill detachment rate kg m 2 s 1 g is the sediment load in rill flow kg m 1 s 1 t c is the sediment transport capacity kg m 1 s 1 i e the maximum sediment load that a rill flow can carry and d c is the detachment capacity kg m 2 s 1 expressed as 2 d c k r œÑ œÑ c where k r is the rill erodibility s m 1 œÑ is the flow shear stress acting on the soil pa and œÑ c is the critical shear stress of the soil pa rill detachment is considered to be zero when flow shear stress is less than the critical shear stress of the soil eq 1 reflects the sediment feedback for soil detachment in rills and can be rearranged as 3 d r d c d c t c g where d c and d c t c are constant for a given hydraulic sediment and soil condition there s a linear negative relationship between sediment load and soil detachment the rill detachment rate is known to decrease as sediment loads increase as the energy expended on transport sediments increases thus reducing the energy available to detach soil particles nearing et al 1991 cochrane and flanagan 1997 studied the effect of incoming sediment concentration on the detachment rate using a simulated rill hydraulic flume and their results showed that all the experiments were qualitatively compatible with the sediment feedback term 1 g t c merten et al 2001 concluded that detachment rate decreased as sediment load increased as a first order function through a variable flume test a linear relationship between detachment rate and sediment load was also reported by lei et al 2002 zhang et al 2005 validated the detachment transport coupling concept in wepp using spatially distributed rill erosion data measured with sediment tracers of rare earth elements zhang et al 2009 and shen et al 2016 both indicated that the feedback relationship between sediment load and detachment rate could be adequately represented by the first order coupling equation in wepp and could be used to simulate soil erosion processes in rills on both gentle and steep slopes however huang et al 1996 conducted a field experiment to examine the validity of the coupled detachment and transport concept and reported rill detachment rate was independent of sediment load no significant interaction between sediment load and soil detachment was observed by bennett et al 2000 either gimenez and govers 2002 compared detachment rates by concentrated flow between small samples with smooth surfaces and natural rills with rough irregular surfaces and reported that the relationship between soil detachment and sediment transport could not be linked through a constant and might be more complex than the simple first order coupling lei et al 2006 also found that the feedback relationship between sediment load and soil detachment was complex depending on the slope the above review indicates that there exists a strong effect of sediment load on soil detachment in some experiments while only a minor effect in others moreover it is still unsure whether a first order coupling model is indeed the best possible formulation of representing the interactions govers et al 2007 to date the published validation results for the first order coupling concept proposed by foster and meyer 1972 are still inconsistent an understanding of how soil detachment rate responds to actual sediment laden flow still needs to be improved the hydrodynamic characteristics shear stress stream power and so forth of a flow are important predictors for soil detachment numerous investigations were conducted at high flow discharges indicating that rill detachment could be very well predicted using shear stress or stream power however little data was obtained at low flow discharges wang et al 2016 investigated the relationship of soil detachment by rill flow and various hydrodynamic parameters at low flow discharges 0 00067 m2 s 1 the results showed that predictions of detachment based on shear stress were poorer than those based on stream power the responses of soil detachment rate to hydrodynamics need to be further studied 0 00100 m2 s 1 used in this study at low flow rates turbulence is a critical component for soil detachment to occur in rills nearing et al 1991 detachment by flow seldom occur without turbulence nearing and parker 1994 soil detachment occurs only when the burst force localized events of high intensity turbulence is greater than the resistance or coherence of soil particles which can produce large fluctuations in stresses on the soil surface with enough energy to dislodge particles from the soil mass nearing 1991 merten et al 2001 it has been empirically shown that there is a considerable effect of sediment load on the flow turbulence structure for sediment laden flows detachment rates were increasingly limited with the reduction in turbulence associated with increasing sediment in the flow polyakov and nearing 2003 the reason for detachment reduction with increased sediment load was dues to the reduced turbulent intensities imparted to the soil bed when sediment was in the flow merten et al 2001 this phenomenon largely resulted from changes in viscosity and density of the sediment laden flow and interaction between water molecules and sediment particles zhang et al 2010 that said it would be reasonable to hypothesize that the particle sizes in sediment laden flow could affect the turbulence and detachability wang and larsen 1994 demonstrated that fine sediments could reduce the intensity of the turbulence and the turbulence intensity was greater in flows with coarser sand loads due to decreased viscosity with coarser particles merten et al 2001 introduced two sizes of uniform glass beads equivalent to coarse silt 0 039 mm and coarse sand 0 510 mm to rill flow the results showed that the coarse beads treatment did have significantly less total detachment than did the fine beads treatment under high sediment input rates to date most studies are focused on the effect of sediment sizes on transportability but less on the potential effect of sediment sizes in flows on detachment rates the objectives of this study were 1 to establish the relationship between detachment rate by rill flow and hydrodynamic parameters under low flow discharges 2 to quantify the response of soil detachment rate to sediment load 3 determine the influence of sediment median sizes introduced into rill flow on soil detachment 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil sample properties experiments were conducted in the geography laboratory of the shaanxi normal university china a malvern mastersizer 2000 laser diffraction device malvern instruments ltd uk was used to analyze the particle size distributions the soil tested for detachment was from the ansai county in the heartland of the loess plateau a typically hilly and gully region the soil was a silt loam usda collected from 0 to 25 cm depth of the tillage layer with 13 7 clay 49 5 silt and 36 8 sand and d50 is 0 039 mm two soils that were introduced as the sediment sources to flow were from the shenmu county a rich and coarse sediment area located upstream of ansai one is a sandy loam having 4 7 clay 21 6 silt and 73 6 sand with a d50 of 0 078 mm and another is a sand having 1 1 clay 1 1 silt and 97 8 sand with a d50 of 0 233 mm all soil samples were air dried and passed through a 5 mm sieve to remove

discussions 3 1 hydrodynamic index of soil detachment rate under clear water and sediment laden flow detachment capacity was the measured detachment rate when the sediment load was zero clear water detachment capacity increased as shear stress increased in a linear relationship fig 2 according to the formulation of the wepp model eq 2 if a linear function exists between detachment capacity and flow shear stress the slope of the regression line is the rill erodibility parameter k r and the intercept on the x axis is the critical shear stress œÑ c nearing et al 1989 soil detachment occurs when shear stress exceeds a critical value the results showed a value of 0 0188 s m 1 for soil erodibility and 1 48 pa for critical shear stress which are relatively close to 0 0164 s m 1 and 2 08 pa reported by zhang et al 2008 in their study the same soil from ansai was tested but the soil was intact in contrast the soil was sieved thru a 5 mm sieve and compacted artificially in this study the packed soil compared with the intact soil lost the original soil structure and had lower resistance to detachment resulting in a higher rill erodibility and a lower critical shear stress actual detachment rate by a sediment laden flow is less than detachment capacity and is strongly influenced by the hydraulics of the flow such as shear stress or stream power detachment rates increased as shear stress increased table 1 for sediment laden flows analyses indicated that detachment rates could be represented by linear functions of shear stress r 2 0 54 although the shapes of the equations were same the coefficients of shear stress were different for different sediment loads however the coefficients were quite similar for a constant sediment concentration varying from 0 0156 to 0 0283 0 0080 to 0 1130 and 0 0061 to 0 0081 for 50 100 and 200 kg m 3 respectively in this study the relationships between detachment and shear stress at low flow discharges could be described by linear functions consistent with the previous study at higher flow discharges laflen et al 1991 zhang et al 2002 however the relationship differed from the power relationships obtained at similar low flow discharges wang et al 2016 a few studies reported that flow stream power compared with shear stress was a better hydraulic predictor for soil detachment zhang et al 2002 wang et al 2016 the relationships between detachment rate and stream power were also included in table 1 the results revealed that soil detachment rates were generally better simulated by stream power r 2 0 85 the better linear regressions for stream power than for shear stress agreed with the conclusion by wang et al 2016 for low flow discharges stream power denotes the rate of energy consumption of runoff water on the soil surface per unit bed area soil detachment can happen only when stream power exceeds the critical value which may be estimated from the linear equations compared with power equations for stream power zhang et al 2002 linear relationship possesses more physical meanings in the erosion process the ranges of the coefficients of stream power in the equations also differed among three sediment concentrations generally decreasing with the sediment concentrations because the same soil was used for all tests the differences in the coefficients among three sediment concentrations might have reflected the differences in detachment according to the feedback effect of the inflow sediment indicating the effect of sediment load on soil detachment the higher the sediment concentrations the greater the feedback effect and thus the smaller the coefficients moreover for a constant sediment concentration different sediment sizes also yielded different coefficients suggesting sediment sizes had an effect on detachment as well the coefficients seemed to increase with a decrease sediment size at low concentrations while the opposite happened at high concentrations this indicates a complex interactive effect of the sediment loads and particle sizes on soil detachment 3 2 response of detachment rate on sediment load to quantify sediment feedback for soil detachment detachment rates with different sediment loads for three flow discharges under five sediment median sizes are presented in fig 3 detachment rates decreased as sediment loads increased which was in qualitative agreement with eq 3 regression analysis indicated that exponential functions fitted the relationship between detachment rate and sediment load slightly better than linear functions for most cases table 2 some exponential regressions were also obtained by zhang et al 2009 who attributed the nonlinearity to measurement errors for consistency with eq 3 the linear regressions are only presented in table 2 and discussed here in depth the negative relationships between detachment rates and sediment loads existed for all flows and sediment sizes although exponential functions fitted slightly better than linear ones the determination coefficients of the linear equations were generally satisfactory varying from 0 82 to 0 99 indicating that the linear approximation of the sediment feedback effect is acceptable the results were consistent with the first order model of eq 3 suggested by foster and meyer 1972 demonstrating the basic validity of the detachment rate function of the wepp model eq 3 as was also shown by lei et al 2002 and shen et al 2016 in general the linear equations described the coupling relationship between detachment rate and sediment load reasonably well according to eq 3 the coefficient of sediment load was the ratio of detachment capacity over transport capacity and the constant was detachment capacity in other word the vertical intercepts of these equations reflected the detachment capacities when sediment load was nil and the horizontal intercepts represented transport capacities when detachment approached zero sediment transport capacities for each flow and sediment size were not directly measured in this study and thus the horizontal intercepts could not be compared for each flow and sediment size group i e each line in fig 3 d c and t c should be constant and therefore each line should follow a linear downward trend according to eq 3 to further examine the coupling concept of eq 3 the estimated detachment capacity i e the vertical intercept the linear regression equations in table 2 was compared with the measured data the results indicated that the estimated detachment capacity matched the measured detachment capacity very well r 2 0 99 nse 0 95 the relative error varied from 1 7 to 14 5 with a mean are being 6 8 there are three reasons for explaining the feedback relationship between sediment load and detachment rate in the literature zhang et al 2009 shen et al 2016 in our study a non erodible flume bed and a fixed slope gradient were used for a certain flow discharge the energy of the flow was finite and constant when the energy used for sediment transport increased as sediment load increased less energy was available for soil detachment moore and burch 1986 resulting in a decreased detachment the second reason was the effect of flow turbulence on soil detachment soil detachment occurs only when the transient shear stress caused by turbulence is greater than the cohesive force of soil particles reduction of turbulence induced by increased sediment load would reduce the probability of the detachment occurrence nearing 1991 polyakov and nearing 2003 the third explanation largely refers to the shielding effect of the soil surface by sediment particles on the flow bed which prevent flow from further detaching soil polyakov and nearing 2003 hairsine and rose 1992 those authors also hypothesized that less energy was required to maintain the movement of the sediment in flow than that required to detach new soil 3 3 effect of sediment median size on soil detachment rate as mentioned above for a certain flow discharge detachment capacity of the flow for a given soil was constant while sediment transport capacity varied with sediment particle sizes for example a greater t c is expected for a smaller sediment size thus the inclination of the plots in fig 3 should vary with sediment sizes even for the same flow discharge according to eq 3 due to changes in t c the changes in inclination with sediment sizes was confirmed in this study under the same flow discharge there were changes in the plot inclination between five sediment size groups fig 3 such changes largely resulted from the differences in particle sizes as indicated by the coefficients of sediment load in table 2 the results showed that the inclines decreased with decreasing sediment median size for a given flow discharge due to increased t c and this decrement weakened as flow discharges increased table 2 fig 3 this could be because t c became less sensitive to sediment sizes at greater flow discharges the results also indicated that the linearity increased as flow discharges increased from low to intermediate to high rates taken together for a given flow discharge the larger the sediment median size the steeper the incline and thus the lesser detachment for a given sediment load to further examine this effect the variation of detachment rate with sediment median size under different flow discharges and sediment concentrations is presented in fig 4 under each combination of flow discharge and sediment concentration the sediment median size had a pronounced negative impact on the detachment rates the greater the median sediment sizes the less the soil detachment in addition the effects of sediment load on soil detachment were clearly demonstrated for each flow rate in fig 4 multivariate regression showed that the overall responsive relationship of soil detachment rate to sediment load and sediment median size for all combinations could be well described by the multivariate linear equations for each flow rate table 3 soil detachment rate by sediment laden rill flow was negatively related to both sediment load and sediment median size the determination coefficients r 2 were 0 77 and the average relative errors are were 14 these highly statistically significant equations clearly demonstrated the effects of sediment load and size on soil detachment and elucidated the detailed soil detachment processes in rill erosion as affected by sediment load and size the froude and reynold s numbers observed in this study were within the range reported for rills by nearing et al 1997 the reynold s number ranged between 315 and 1020 and froude number varied from 1 46 to 3 48 a majority of the data represented supercritical turbulent hydraulic regime and the results of this study were reflective of the turbulent nature of rill flows the differences in size groups in this study are mainly the differences in proportions of fine and coarse particles a greater median size simply means more coarse particles in sediment the effect of sediment median size on soil detachment rate could be interpreted by three possible reasons first the flow energy that is consumed by maintaining the motion of sediments is not available for detachment more energy expenditure on transporting coarser particles led to the lesser energy available for detaching the soil second sediment sizes affect the modes of particle transport in flow coarser particles tend to be transported near the bottom of the flow as bed load because of greater gravity which may form a moving layer of dense sediment the moving layer could shield the soil surface from flow detachment and reduce the bottom shear stress acting on undetached soil chanson and qiao 1994 lower shear stresses acting on the soil surfaces result in less soil detachment third it is related to turbulence ali et al 2012 reported that the mean flow velocities were progressively lower with the increase in sediment grain size and the highest values of flow velocities were observed for the finest sediment detachment rates were increasingly limited by the turbulence reduction associated with the increasing sediment sizes it was expected that little effect of sediment size might be exhibited if flow turbulence was far greater than the turbulence variation induced by sediment sizes changes such as in case of high flow discharge with low sediment concentration it should be pointed out that the sediments used for the study were the mixtures of two soils with a range of particle size distributions rather than a uniform size in each class the results of this study would be somewhat different from those if a uniform size of each class had been used however we believed that the general conclusions and the nature of the relationships between sediment load and soil detachment for different size classes would be similar and that the results using mixed sizes would be closer to the reality than using a single uniform size 4 conclusions the impact of sediment load and sediment median size on soil detachment rate by sediment laden rill flow was investigated through a flume test under low flow discharges the relationship between soil detachment capacity and shear stress fits the wepp model well stream power than shear stress is a better hydraulic parameter in simulating soil detachment rate under different sediment concentrations the differences in the coefficients of stream power under different sediment concentrations and sizes could be explained by the effect of sediment feedback and particle sizes the soil detachment rate by sediment laden rill flow was negatively related to both sediment load and sediment median size the results clearly demonstrated that a significant sediment coupling relationship between rill detachment and sediment transport existed for different sediment sizes and the first order sediment feedback in the wepp model was approximately valid the detachment capacity estimated by the coupling concept agreed with the measured detachment capacity very well r 2 0 99 nse 0 95 detachment rates decreased as sediment median sizes increased

6734,rigorous validation of the first order detachment transport coupling concept using different sediment sizes is nonexistent in the literature we hypothesized that particle sizes in a sediment

concentrated flow is capable of detaching and transporting sediments from the soil mass soil detachment defined as the dislodgement of soil particles from the soil mass needs to be quantified in process based erosion models foster and meyer 1972 theoretically a given discharge of clear water on a certain slope can detach a maximum amount of soil defined as the detachment capacity d c the actual rate of detachment d r of a sediment laden flow will normally be lower than the detachment capacity as the maximum detachment can only occur with clear water that contains no sediments foster and meyer 1972 thus it is important to quantify the relationship between detachment rate and sediment load foster and meyer 1972 proposed a first order detachment transport coupling equation assuming that soil detachment only occurs when the sediment load g is less than transport capacity t c this equation is used as the governing equation in water erosion predict project wepp model as 1 d r d c 1 g t c where d r is the rill detachment rate kg m 2 s 1 g is the sediment load in rill flow kg m 1 s 1 t c is the sediment transport capacity kg m 1 s 1 i e the maximum sediment load that a rill flow can carry and d c is the detachment capacity kg m 2 s 1 expressed as 2 d c k r œÑ œÑ c where k r is the rill erodibility s m 1 œÑ is the flow shear stress acting on the soil pa and œÑ c is the critical shear stress of the soil pa rill detachment is considered to be zero when flow shear stress is less than the critical shear stress of the soil eq 1 reflects the sediment feedback for soil detachment in rills and can be rearranged as 3 d r d c d c t c g where d c and d c t c are constant for a given hydraulic sediment and soil condition there s a linear negative relationship between sediment load and soil detachment the rill detachment rate is known to decrease as sediment loads increase as the energy expended on transport sediments increases thus reducing the energy available to detach soil particles nearing et al 1991 cochrane and flanagan 1997 studied the effect of incoming sediment concentration on the detachment rate using a simulated rill hydraulic flume and their results showed that all the experiments were qualitatively compatible with the sediment feedback term 1 g t c merten et al 2001 concluded that detachment rate decreased as sediment load increased as a first order function through a variable flume test a linear relationship between detachment rate and sediment load was also reported by lei et al 2002 zhang et al 2005 validated the detachment transport coupling concept in wepp using spatially distributed rill erosion data measured with sediment tracers of rare earth elements zhang et al 2009 and shen et al 2016 both indicated that the feedback relationship between sediment load and detachment rate could be adequately represented by the first order coupling equation in wepp and could be used to simulate soil erosion processes in rills on both gentle and steep slopes however huang et al 1996 conducted a field experiment to examine the validity of the coupled detachment and transport concept and reported rill detachment rate was independent of sediment load no significant interaction between sediment load and soil detachment was observed by bennett et al 2000 either gimenez and govers 2002 compared detachment rates by concentrated flow between small samples with smooth surfaces and natural rills with rough irregular surfaces and reported that the relationship between soil detachment and sediment transport could not be linked through a constant and might be more complex than the simple first order coupling lei et al 2006 also found that the feedback relationship between sediment load and soil detachment was complex depending on the slope the above review indicates that there exists a strong effect of sediment load on soil detachment in some experiments while only a minor effect in others moreover it is still unsure whether a first order coupling model is indeed the best possible formulation of representing the interactions govers et al 2007 to date the published validation results for the first order coupling concept proposed by foster and meyer 1972 are still inconsistent an understanding of how soil detachment rate responds to actual sediment laden flow still needs to be improved the hydrodynamic characteristics shear stress stream power and so forth of a flow are important predictors for soil detachment numerous investigations were conducted at high flow discharges indicating that rill detachment could be very well predicted using shear stress or stream power however little data was obtained at low flow discharges wang et al 2016 investigated the relationship of soil detachment by rill flow and various hydrodynamic parameters at low flow discharges 0 00067 m2 s 1 the results showed that predictions of detachment based on shear stress were poorer than those based on stream power the responses of soil detachment rate to hydrodynamics need to be further studied 0 00100 m2 s 1 used in this study at low flow rates turbulence is a critical component for soil detachment to occur in rills nearing et al 1991 detachment by flow seldom occur without turbulence nearing and parker 1994 soil detachment occurs only when the burst force localized events of high intensity turbulence is greater than the resistance or coherence of soil particles which can produce large fluctuations in stresses on the soil surface with enough energy to dislodge particles from the soil mass nearing 1991 merten et al 2001 it has been empirically shown that there is a considerable effect of sediment load on the flow turbulence structure for sediment laden flows detachment rates were increasingly limited with the reduction in turbulence associated with increasing sediment in the flow polyakov and nearing 2003 the reason for detachment reduction with increased sediment load was dues to the reduced turbulent intensities imparted to the soil bed when sediment was in the flow merten et al 2001 this phenomenon largely resulted from changes in viscosity and density of the sediment laden flow and interaction between water molecules and sediment particles zhang et al 2010 that said it would be reasonable to hypothesize that the particle sizes in sediment laden flow could affect the turbulence and detachability wang and larsen 1994 demonstrated that fine sediments could reduce the intensity of the turbulence and the turbulence intensity was greater in flows with coarser sand loads due to decreased viscosity with coarser particles merten et al 2001 introduced two sizes of uniform glass beads equivalent to coarse silt 0 039 mm and coarse sand 0 510 mm to rill flow the results showed that the coarse beads treatment did have significantly less total detachment than did the fine beads treatment under high sediment input rates to date most studies are focused on the effect of sediment sizes on transportability but less on the potential effect of sediment sizes in flows on detachment rates the objectives of this study were 1 to establish the relationship between detachment rate by rill flow and hydrodynamic parameters under low flow discharges 2 to quantify the response of soil detachment rate to sediment load 3 determine the influence of sediment median sizes introduced into rill flow on soil detachment 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil sample properties experiments were conducted in the geography laboratory of the shaanxi normal university

table 2 and discussed here in depth the negative relationships between detachment rates and sediment loads existed for all flows and sediment sizes although exponential functions fitted slightly better than linear ones the determination coefficients of the linear equations were generally satisfactory varying from 0 82 to 0 99 indicating that the linear approximation of the sediment feedback effect is acceptable the results were consistent with the first order model of eq 3 suggested by foster and meyer 1972 demonstrating the basic validity of the detachment rate function of the wepp model eq 3 as was also shown by lei et al 2002 and shen et al 2016 in general the linear equations described the coupling relationship between detachment rate and sediment load reasonably well according to eq 3 the coefficient of sediment load was the ratio of detachment capacity over transport capacity and the constant was detachment capacity in other word the vertical intercepts of these equations reflected the detachment capacities when sediment load was nil and the horizontal intercepts represented transport capacities when detachment approached zero sediment transport capacities for each flow and sediment size were not directly measured in this study and thus the horizontal intercepts could not be compared for each flow and sediment size group i e each line in fig 3 d c and t c should be constant and therefore each line should follow a linear downward trend according to eq 3 to further examine the coupling concept of eq 3 the estimated detachment capacity i e the vertical intercept the linear regression equations in table 2 was compared with the measured data the results indicated that the estimated detachment capacity matched the measured detachment capacity very well r 2 0 99 nse 0 95 the relative error varied from 1 7 to 14 5 with a mean are being 6 8 there are three reasons for explaining the feedback relationship between sediment load and detachment rate in the literature zhang et al 2009 shen et al 2016 in our study a non erodible flume bed and a fixed slope gradient were used for a certain flow discharge the energy of the flow was finite and constant when the energy used for sediment transport increased as sediment load increased less energy was available for soil detachment moore and burch 1986 resulting in a decreased detachment the second reason was the effect of flow turbulence on soil detachment soil detachment occurs only when the transient shear stress caused by turbulence is greater than the cohesive force of soil particles reduction of turbulence induced by increased sediment load would reduce the probability of the detachment occurrence nearing 1991 polyakov and nearing 2003 the third explanation largely refers to the shielding effect of the soil surface by sediment particles on the flow bed which prevent flow from further detaching soil polyakov and nearing 2003 hairsine and rose 1992 those authors also hypothesized that less energy was required to maintain the movement of the sediment in flow than that required to detach new soil 3 3 effect of sediment median size on soil detachment rate as mentioned above for a certain flow discharge detachment capacity of the flow for a given soil was constant while sediment transport capacity varied with sediment particle sizes for example a greater t c is expected for a smaller sediment size thus the inclination of the plots in fig 3 should vary with sediment sizes even for the same flow discharge according to eq 3 due to changes in t c the changes in inclination with sediment sizes was confirmed in this study under the same flow discharge there were changes in the plot inclination between five sediment size groups fig 3 such changes largely resulted from the differences in particle sizes as indicated by the coefficients of sediment load in table 2 the results showed that the inclines decreased with decreasing sediment median size for a given flow discharge due to increased t c and this decrement weakened as flow discharges increased table 2 fig 3 this could be because t c became less sensitive to sediment sizes at greater flow discharges the results also indicated that the linearity increased as flow discharges increased from low to intermediate to high rates taken together for a given flow discharge the larger the sediment median size the steeper the incline and thus the lesser detachment for a given sediment load to further examine this effect the variation of detachment rate with sediment median size under different flow discharges and sediment concentrations is presented in fig 4 under each combination of flow discharge and sediment concentration the sediment median size had a pronounced negative impact on the detachment rates the greater the median sediment sizes the less the soil detachment in addition the effects of sediment load on soil detachment were clearly demonstrated for each flow rate in fig 4 multivariate regression showed that the overall responsive relationship of soil detachment rate to sediment load and sediment median size for all combinations could be well described by the multivariate linear equations for each flow rate table 3 soil detachment rate by sediment laden rill flow was negatively related to both sediment load and sediment median size the determination coefficients r 2 were 0 77 and the average relative errors are were 14 these highly statistically significant equations clearly demonstrated the effects of sediment load and size on soil detachment and elucidated the detailed soil detachment processes in rill erosion as affected by sediment load and size the froude and reynold s numbers observed in this study were within the range reported for rills by nearing et al 1997 the reynold s number ranged between 315 and 1020 and froude number varied from 1 46 to 3 48 a majority of the data represented supercritical turbulent hydraulic regime and the results of this study were reflective of the turbulent nature of rill flows the differences in size groups in this study are mainly the differences in proportions of fine and coarse particles a greater median size simply means more coarse particles in sediment the effect of sediment median size on soil detachment rate could be interpreted by three possible reasons first the flow energy that is consumed by maintaining the motion of sediments is not available for detachment more energy expenditure on transporting coarser particles led to the lesser energy available for detaching the soil second sediment sizes affect the modes of particle transport in flow coarser particles tend to be transported near the bottom of the flow as bed load because of greater gravity which may form a moving layer of dense sediment the moving layer could shield the soil surface from flow detachment and reduce the bottom shear stress acting on undetached soil chanson and qiao 1994 lower shear stresses acting on the soil surfaces result in less soil detachment third it is related to turbulence ali et al 2012 reported that the mean flow velocities were progressively lower with the increase in sediment grain size and the highest values of flow velocities were observed for the finest sediment detachment rates were increasingly limited by the turbulence reduction associated with the increasing sediment sizes it was expected that little effect of sediment size might be exhibited if flow turbulence was far greater than the turbulence variation induced by sediment sizes changes such as in case of high flow discharge with low sediment concentration it should be pointed out that the sediments used for the study were the mixtures of two soils with a range of particle size distributions rather than a uniform size in each class the results of this study would be somewhat different from those if a uniform size of each class had been used however we believed that the general conclusions and the nature of the relationships between sediment load and soil detachment for different size classes would be similar and that the results using mixed sizes would be closer to the reality than using a single uniform size 4 conclusions the impact of sediment load and sediment median size on soil detachment rate by sediment laden rill flow was investigated through a flume test under low flow discharges the relationship between soil detachment capacity and shear stress fits the wepp model well stream power than shear stress is a better hydraulic parameter in simulating soil detachment rate under different sediment concentrations the differences in the coefficients of stream power under different sediment concentrations and sizes could be explained by the effect of sediment feedback and particle sizes the soil detachment rate by sediment laden rill flow was negatively related to both sediment load and sediment median size the results clearly demonstrated that a significant sediment coupling relationship between rill detachment and sediment transport existed for different sediment sizes and the first order sediment feedback in the wepp model was approximately valid the detachment capacity estimated by the coupling concept agreed with the measured detachment capacity very well r 2 0 99 nse 0 95 detachment rates decreased as sediment median sizes increased the overall responses of soil detachment rate to sediment load and sediment median size followed multivariate linear relationships and the determination coefficients r 2 were 0 77 further
