1885,we used the distributed hydrologic model gssha to simulate overland runoff from impervious and semi pervious low vegetation land covers in a 0 3 km2 urban catchment the model is hypothetical which allowed us to test alternative land use configurations and better understand the effects of urban heterogeneity to track the arrival of water to a stormwater basin inlet from distinct parts of the catchment we applied a conservative solute tracer to portions of the gridded model area a new application for gssha s contaminant transport module we rearranged the positions of pervious and impervious land uses over the catchment during four storm events and found that the portion of total runoff volume from impervious areas varied from 50 to 75 while the relative proportion of impervious cover remained constant at 54 we also applied solute to equal sized zones with different slopes and land uses and found that percent imperviousness did not predict solute mobilization furthermore variation in total runoff volume and peak discharge for different land use arrangements and storm sizes showed that percent imperviousness could not be used to estimate a runoff rainfall ratio fluctuating solute proportions over time suggested that grab samples might not be adequate for capturing average overland runoff chemistry we quantified factors contributing to non linearity in rainfall runoff responses from an urban watershed with stormwater infrastructure and determined that using models to find hotspots for stormwater infiltration and to explore resilience to future storm events can improve design and function of stormwater control measures keywords gssha urban runoff impervious surfaces distributed parameter model rainfallrunoff analysis event mean concentrations stormwater management 1 introduction imperviousness has been related to high peak flows and pollutant loads in urban runoff arnold gibbons 1996 schueler et al 2009 to mitigate these threats to stream health stormwater control measures scms are introduced estimating pollutant concentrations is important for designers of scms to evaluate or predict the effectiveness of their basins park et al 2009 mcnett et al 2011 but contaminant concentrations in urban runoff are difficult to determine due to heterogeneity in sources and land use complex connectivity in flow paths and uncertain rainfall runoff relationships in the urban environment brezonik and stadelmann 2002 shuster et al 2007 the effects scms seek to mitigate can be summarized by the urban stream syndrome flashy hydrographs contamination and low biodiversity walsh et al 2005 but imperviousness alone or the reduction in imperviousness produced by scms does not directly predict stream health lee heaney 2003 walsh et al 2022 hopkins et al 2015 furthermore pollutant loads are often estimated with event mean concentrations emcs which are based on the percentages of land uses in the catchment overall and emcs are used with varying success for scm planning and monitoring melcher horsburgh 2017 one aim of stormwater control measures is to reduce the amount of directly connected impervious area dcia in catchments dcia has been proposed as a metric for predicting runoff quantity and is potentially more effective than overall land use or imperviousness lee heaney 2003 because it focuses on impervious areas that are hydrologically connected to the catchment outlet i e not separated by any pervious land however the dcia concept assumes that runoff infiltrates in the vegetated zones between disconnected impervious areas which due to compaction and or saturation may not always be the case lim 2016 ebrahimian et al 2016 walsh et al 2022 found connected imperviousness to be a moderately good predictor of reactive phosphorus and stream biotic index whereas hopkins et al 2015 found that road density was the best metric for predicting hydrologic responses in urban watersheds both walsh et al and hopkins et al note that topography and soil permeability had impacts that caused heterogeneity in stream responses even in watersheds with similar road densities or dcia in contrast bell et al 2016 found that total imperviousness is a better predictor of overland runoff than the extent of imperviousness disconnecting with scms especially as scm effectiveness appears to vary depending on its placement on a landscape voter and loheide 2018 found that soil compaction drives the effectiveness of various scm types and that microtopography on a residential lot scale can lengthen runoff pathways they determined that the effectiveness of soil amendments for overland runoff reduction depends on their locations with amendments near impervious surfaces and on sloped yards being most effective voter and loheide 2020 variable source area vsa which describes areas which periodically generate saturation excess non hortonian overland flow was conceptualized as one explanation for non linear rainfall runoff responses lee delluer 1976 reasons for vsas developing include the presence of shallow subsurface restrictive layers e g stewart et al 2019 shallow water tables and steep hillslopes vsas were initially described for humid forested watersheds hewlett hibbert 1967 while in urban areas imperviousness and landscape alteration make the size and location of vsas more difficult to predict easton et al 2007 some urban areas do show variable source behavior such as extended hydrographs valeo et al 2001 which is attributed to the same saturation excess flow or quick interflow processes as are described in natural catchments however in urban areas with stormwater infrastructure additional non hortonian processes like fast flow through subsurface pipes also contribute to a non linear relationship between rainfall and runoff miles and band 2015 lim 2016 one tool used to predict the likelihood of vsas developing on hillslopes prone to saturation excess runoff betson 1964 hewlett hibbert 1967 is the topographic wetness index twi twi is calculated from the slope and upstream contributing area at a given point beven kirby 1978 burt butcher 1985 anderson et al 2015 who studied twi to identify saturation prone areas where denitrification might occur found periodically saturated areas vsas denitrification rates and twi were all closely related however twi correlates to not only saturation but also to observed soil moisture patterns especially when high resolution digital elevation data are used buchanan et al 2014 in urban catchments of baltimore and new york city studied by kelleher mcphillips 2019 the average twi at areas with reported flooding was higher than the average twi across the watersheds with imperviousness or dcia as inconsistent predictors of runoff quantity examining land use hydrologic connectivity vsa and rainfall events in combination may be necessary to understand urban runoff specifically tracking changes in soil moisture and runoff generation can help determine likely areas for saturation excess overland flow or areas that might contribute runoff inconsistently whether via the subsurface or not whether catchment connectivity is influenced by soil moisture and rainfall or whether soil moisture dynamics are influenced by connectivity and rainfall is difficult to untangle zhang shuster 2014 sytsma et al 2020 in short it is important to understand all of the processes that lead to variability in the runoff rainfall ratio and how they work in combination mcdonnell 2003 and how they change over time nippgen et al 2015 surface water models can be used to track the flow of runoff and contaminants across a landscape and to pinpoint the location of high soil moisture vsas or the ideal placements of scms easton et al 2008 smith et al 2015 an 11 4 ha catchment in finland was modeled using the us epa s swmm and contaminant washoff was simulated to determine which areas of the watershed contributed the most to nonpoint source pollution tuomela et al 2019 it was found that land use sources could be pinpointed for individual contaminants but the location of specific source areas could not be distinguished because swmm assigns parameters to regions not individual model cells unlike swmm the us army corps of engineers gridded surface subsurface hydrological analysis gssha model is fully distributed and so can be used to model the spatial heterogeneity of overland runoff and the extent and location of ponded water downer et al 2002 downer ogden 2004 gssha is also process based using governing equations to determine water fluxes process based models are preferred for applications which require an understanding of spatial and temporal variability fatichi et al 2016 since its inception gssha has been applied to urban watersheds because its spatially distributed parameters make it a good choice for modeling urban heterogeneity niedzialek ogden 2003 al areeq et al 2021 a severe flood in a 55 km2 texas watershed was modeled with gssha by sharif et al 2010 although the model was only minimally calibrated when rainfall was distributed accurately discharge from the 2004 storm event was reproduced correctly which is attributed to the model being both distributed and process based with fine resolution elevation and land characteristic data smaller watersheds like the 14 km2 dead run watershed near baltimore md can be simulated ogden et al 2011 modeling in dead run revealed that increases in imperviousness and drainage density caused increases in flood peaks but that peak flow is less affected in extreme events two urban watersheds in roanoke va were modeled with both swmm and gssha and the model was calibrated with 9 events gssha was found to be more effective at predicting the extent of flooding brendel et al 2021 beyond simulating flooding and streamflow in urban watersheds gssha can be used to investigate hypothetical scenarios for example smith et al 2015 modeled the same dead run watershed as described above ogden et al 2011 but focused on hypothetical changes in discharge when detention basins were removed or when compacted urban soils were replaced with natural soils with higher infiltration capacity notably it was found that the location of drainage basins altered their efficiency paudel et al 2011 determined that gssha was better suited for investigating future land use change in a synthetic watershed than lumped models however hypothetical applications of models in urban watersheds are not limited to gssha lee et al 2018 used lumped parameters of artificial hydrologic response elements to find the most effective placement of impervious and pervious areas for reducing peak flows and wang et al 2021 used swmm to test scenarios with different amounts of imperviousness we expand upon previous work investigating land use position and green infrastructure placement ogden et al 2011 paudel et al 2011 by altering the patterns of land use in a hypothetical catchment and identifying the areas responsible for generating runoff and mobilizing solutes in this study we focused on a well drained catchment with a deep 10 12 m water table and a network of subsurface drainage pipes we assumed that no saturation excess overland flow would be generated but nevertheless took inspiration from the vsa concept and examined how the locations that generate runoff might change during and between storms our goal for this study was to use a discrete parameter model of runoff generating areas to provide an understanding of heterogeneity in overland runoff we investigated four aspects of heterogeneity first we tested the assumption that percent imperviousness is directly related to runoff quantity and quality and proposed additional solutions for understanding land use in catchments second we questioned how disconnecting impervious areas would affect the amount of overland runoff and whether distancing thereby disconnecting impervious areas from the model outlet would reduce modeled discharge additionally as described by ogden et al 2011 we suspected that higher flows would reduce variability between land use scenarios so we used the model for storms of various sizes our fourth question related to the role of low vegetation areas such as fields and yards in urban catchments and we explored how their importance varied over the course of a hydrograph and for different land use distributions we set out to explain how variability in urban runoff is affected by factors beyond percent impervious cover and how variability in source areas for different storms and land use configurations contributes to non linear rainfall runoff relationships 2 methods 2 1 hypothetical catchment although the land use solute transport and storm events simulated in this study were hypothetical the size and shape of the watershed was based on a 0 30 km2 catchment in suburban philadelphia where a constructed stormwater retention basin drains runoff from the upper moreland middle school its athletic fields and a nearby neighborhood fig 1 we input elevation from a digital elevation model dem with 1 m resolution delaware valley regional planning commission 2016 and used surveyed land use classifications for our initial model runs university of vermont spatial analysis laboratory 2016 land use in the watershed was classified as tree canopy 13 barren 2 low vegetation defined as plants less than 2 m in height in this case mainly lawns 44 or impervious cover 41 soil was classified primarily as urban land pavement and areas with fill material and disturbed udorthents soil survey staff soil survey staff natural resources conservation service 2019 because natural resources conservation service soil maps show that soil type does not differ appreciably over the small catchment parameter variation was governed by land use we defined two test zones with distinct slopes in the catchment using the open source software qgis to calculate a metric of slope and catchment area the saga wetness index swi the swi like the more common twi is calculated from the specific catchment area sca or upstream area of a point in the dem and the slope to that point eq 1 the swi differs from the twi only in its calculation of sca and is thought to be more accurate for less steep catchments böhner selige 2006 this catchment ranges in elevation from 77 4 to 91 5 m above sea level and has a gentle slope mean 2 2 1 swi ln sca t a n s l o p e we observed patterns in the swi of the catchment and chose two equally sized zones which were the same approximate distance from the channel to test our hypotheses about the effects of slope and upstream capture area on runoff generation fig 2 in the east center of the catchment a high swi zone mean 6 53 was outlined and a zone of the same size and shape was outlined in the lower swi area in the northern part of the catchment mean 4 99 both zones cover an area of 0 021 km2 and the outline shape was determined by tracking runoff that did not reach the scm inlet from the low slope area si fig 1 compared to an overall average swi of 5 68 in the catchment these zones are notable for being more runoff receiving high swi and more runoff generating low swi respectively than the rest of the catchment these zones were used as source areas for flow paths but were not incorporated into the model for soil moisture calculations 2 2 gssha the us army corps of engineers aquavevo watershed modeling system wms was used for visualization and analysis and gssha was used to model overland flow channel flow and flow through a subsurface storm drainage network in gssha a watershed is divided into uniform grid cells and the path of water through each cell is calculated we simulated precipitation green ampt infiltration with soil moisture redistribution ogden and saghafian 1997 overland flow via 2d routing flow through channels with a diffusive wave equation flow through storm infrastructure solute transport and evapotranspiration with the penman method although infiltration was calculated no groundwater inputs or groundwater recharge was considered gssha can be used for 3 d models but because the scm inlet pipe the model s outlet is above the water table groundwater was left out so that we could focus on storm flow the 0 30 km2 catchment was divided into 5 m by 5 m grid cells with its outlet set at the location of a 1 1 m diameter storm pipe flowing into the stormwater retention basin at this location runoff volume and solute mass were output at 5 minute intervals as this model is hypothetical the storm drainage network was simplified and represented by a single drainage pipe with multiple inlets modeled with the superlink function in gssha which uses the conservation of mass to solve for pipe discharge ogden et al 2012 at the point where the storm drainage system joins the main road in the model where overland flow accumulation was found to be highest via wms topaz d8 flow routing a simplified trapezoidal channel feature 1 m deep with a minimum width of 2 m was used to model combined flow in the road and from the storm pipe system other roadways in the neighborhood section of the catchment do not have storm drainage and so are modeled as impervious surfaces where 2 dimensional overland flow is possible parameters were determined from literature sources and varied by land use type gssha 2016 aboufoul garcia 2017 papaioannou et al 2018 more detailed parameters are given in si table 1 but notably porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity were found to have a significant effect on peak discharge and were adjusted to better fit measured responses in the real catchment before hypothetical simulations began si fig 2 water which enters the model as rainfall is partitioned into infiltration or overland flow which can also be routed to storm pipes during a rain event evapotranspiration does not occur in gssha although direct evaporation of ponded water during dry periods is possible in our scenarios it accounted for less than 0 04 total water volume overland runoff depth and solute mass was recorded at each grid cell every 15 min once generated overland runoff can enter subsurface pipes superlink or flow directly to the channel water in the subsurface pipes is also routed to the channel where channel flow is calculated in one dimension via the explicit diffusive wave method with manning s roughness set to 0 07 downer ogden 2004 channel flow arrives at the model s output analogous to the inlet pipe of the scm where it becomes discharge to measure the arrival time of water from distinct portions of the watersheds we employed gssha s contaminant transport function with a conservative non reactive solute with this tool a chemograph showing mass of the applied solute at the watershed s outlet over time is produced travel times and runoff amounts from specified surface areas of interest e g impervious grid cells or a subsection of the catchment where slope is very low can be compared by applying solute to each area gssha allows solute to be placed on the land surface and taken up by water which is running off of or infiltrating into the land at a rate dependent on its solubility for consistency an initial value of 25 kg m3 solute on the surface was set with the solute s solubility set to 36000 mg l so that it would be readily dissolved this tracer mass allowed visualization of flow paths and does not represent any specific contaminants solute arrival and mass amount was used to approximate overland runoff arrival and amount to compare and standardize solute transport when solute was distributed over non uniform areas solute masses µg are reported normalized over the initial mass present in the model kg when solute was applied to the high slope and low slope zones an equal number of cells received solute so normalization was not necessary 2 3 rainfall events we simulated four storm events with precipitation totals ranging from 10 mm to 84 mm first a real storm with hourly precipitation data from a weather underground personal weather station kpawillo10 https www wunderground com was recorded and water level data were collected from the stormwater inlet pipe in the scm that storm real event had a duration of 9 h and a total accumulation of 37 mm additionally three hypothetical storms were created with the timeseries editor in wms the largest was a 24 hour design storm with a 2 year recurrence interval noaa 2017 with 10 min rainfall data following a nrcs type ii distribution a storm with 2 rainfall peaks was created to illustrate the effects of antecedent moisture using hourly rainfall data because most storms in southeastern pa are small pennsylvania department of environmental protection 2016 we also created a 10 mm low intensity storm event fig 3 si table 2 with rainfall distributed in 6 minute intervals due to the small size of the catchment a single gage was used to input rainfall into gssha the personal weather station is limited in accuracy and resolution producing hourly rainfall totals but for the 2 year and 10 mm storms we used a finer rainfall interval given that the timing of response was not the focus of this model the different resolutions of the rainfall data should not affect interpretations 2 4 land use variation land use raster files university of vermont spatial analysis laboratory 2016 were imported into arcgis for manipulation we observed three main areas of the original land use map the upper moreland middle school school with its parking lots buildings and sidewalks the athletic fields field associated with it and the neighborhood to the north these three land use blocks school field and neighborhood were extracted in arcgis and their positions on the landscape were swapped to ensure that low vegetation and impervious land covers remained in the same proportion in each case an adjustment of the real map was made to include more impervious cover in the school section and remove some impervious cover in the field section but the proportions were similar for modeled and observed land use in the model impervious cover is 49 compared to 41 in reality for our hypothetical land use scenarios we used a scenario similar to the real map neighborhood in the north field in the middle and school in the south or nfs a sfn school in the north neighborhood in the south scenario nsf neighborhood in the north field in the south and fns field in the north school in the south scenario fig 4 for each scenario land use portions were kept approximately constant with 49 impervious cover 41 low vegetation semi pervious 9 tree canopy and the remaining 1 barren ground si table 3 in contrast land use in the low and high slope 0 021 km2 zones varies significantly between land use scenarios for example low vegetation percentages in these zones range from 11 to 100 si table 3 although a total of 6 possible land use scenarios the four listed above and additionally fsn and snf were identified for ease of comparison and because land use in the s and n sections had similar imperviousness we limited our study to these 4 scenarios nfs sfn nsf and fns which cover each section s placement in each position 3 results 3 1 comparing peak flow and runoff volume between land use scenarios for each storm event and land use simulation the input from precipitation and output from infiltration evaporation and overland outflow were recorded and a mass balance of water in the model was validated the water mass balance error was 0 in all rainfall and land use scenarios and less than 1 6 of rainfall volume remained on the surface at the end of each model run mean 0 4 direct evaporation during storm events accounted for less than 0 5 of all output water and less than 0 04 of water traveled through the superlink storm drain network before entering the channel in each modeled run in each of the 16 modeled scenarios between 31 and 69 water infiltrated while 30 68 exited the model as discharge via the channel to the outlet si table 6 peak discharge m3 s and total runoff volume m3 increased with increasing rainfall accumulation and maximum rainfall intensity was also correlated with peak discharge m3 s and total runoff volume m3 si fig 3 however the storms with the highest rainfall accumulation also had the highest rainfall intensity so whether accumulation intensity or both drove the correlation is unclear si fig 3 the relationship between rainfall amount and intensity and runoff volume and peak magnitude was consistent among land use scenarios although the greatest variation between scenarios was observed for peak discharge at the highest precipitation amount in all four rain events the fns land use scenario had the lowest total runoff volume producing between 1 and 4 lower volume than other scenarios produced fig 5 even though the nsf land use scenario had a field with relatively high infiltration which disconnected impervious areas from the model outlet nsf produced the most total runoff volume and peak discharge during the largest storm 2 year event in 2 of the 3 other events the nfs scenario produced the most total discharge the largest discharge was produced when an impervious land use school or neighborhood occupied the most distal northernmost portion of the model regardless of the land uses in the middle or southern parts of the model a paired one tailed t test on discharge produced by the fns scenarios compared to the average discharge produced by the other 3 scenarios with an impervious area in the north suggested that there was a significant difference between the two groups p 0 052 3 2 solute arrival from impervious and low vegetation areas in every storm event and land use scenario more solute from impervious surfaces arrived at the model outlet than solute from low vegetation areas figs 6 and 7 si fig 4 and 5 si table 4 and 5 the first arrival time of each solute at the model outlet and the solute peak time provide additional travel time indicators during storms in the nfs fns and sfn scenarios the impervious solute usually began arriving before the low vegetation solute but peak times between the two solutes only differ by 5 15 min the impervious chemograph also had a rising limb that is typically steeper suggests that solute is mobilized more readily from impervious areas the gap between impervious and low vegetation peak times and arrival times is illustrated in the chemographs for each solute from the 2 peak event fig 7 in the sfn scenario where there is a low vegetation field near the model outlet the low vegetation solute began arriving at the model outlet first but it did not peak before the impervious solute during the event with the highest rainfall amount and intensity the 2 year storm impervious solute and low vegetation solute peaked around the same time 12 1 h after rainfall began but the maximum of the low vegetation peak was higher in the 2 year storm the average low vegetation peak magnitude among all land use scenarios was between 7 and 17 higher than the impervious solute peak although the total amount of impervious solute mobilized was still higher by between 36 and 73 si table 4 due to the high amount of rainfall and the storm s long duration some overbank flow occurred in the channel and a small secondary peak can be observed fig 6 in contrast during the smallest 10 mm storm the amount of impervious solute mobilized was higher both cumulatively and at the peak for all land use scenarios si fig 4 and si table 4 show that impervious mass is more than 100 higher than low vegetation mass in the 2 peak event we compared the heights of the low vegetation and impervious solutes earliest and later hydrograph peaks we found that the difference in peak magnitude between impervious and low vegetation was larger for the first peak than for the second during the 2 peak storm fig 7 si table 4 for example for the nfs scenario during the first peak of the 2 peak storm the impervious solute peak was 151 higher than the low vegetation but only 35 higher during the second larger peak which we attributed to saturation in the low vegetation areas this trend was not observed for the 2 year design event 83 mm storm where the first peak arrived after 12 h of rainfall and generally had similar within 6 23 higher or lower amounts of impervious and low vegetation solutes fig 6 si table 4 we also found that in the 2 peak storm the second peak mobilized more solute overall even though less rain 10 mm instead of 20 mm fell immediately preceding that peak we investigated contributing areas among different land use configurations for each storm event and found that solute from low vegetation made up from 25 to 50 of total solute mobilized fig 8 this range contrasts with the model area which had 46 low vegetation when normalized to just two land use types where solute was applied the smallest storm had the most difference between impervious and low vegetation with low vegetation solute making up 30 of total solute mass and it follows 30 total runoff generated and impervious solute making up a significant majority at 70 fig 8 the amount of solute from impervious and low vegetation areas became more comparable with increasing storm size with 48 from low vegetation and 52 from impervious during the 37 mm real event storm however the trend of increasing low vegetation contributions with increasing precipitation is not true for the largest storm event possibly because of the hours of low intensity precipitation preceding the storm peak fig 6 the smallest storms also had the most variation 8 9 compared to only 5 variation for bigger storms between the amounts of solute generated by low vegetation cells in various land use scenarios our distributed parameter model supports the hypothesis that variation caused by land use is most significant during small storm events although additional uncertainty is introduced by the variety of rainfall time steps used in the modeled storm events 6 min 1 h the dominant land use contributing to overland runoff also shifted from impervious to low vegetation over the course of rain events as indicated by the percent of the total solute mass at a given timestep made up by low vegetation or impervious solute fig 9 during the rising limb of every storm the percentage of impervious solute was higher than the percentage of low vegetation solute for example in the hours preceding the peak of the 37 mm real event storm between 50 76 solute on average 62 originated in impervious areas fig 9 following the peak the percent of solute from low vegetation areas increased and during the falling limb of most hydrographs low vegetation solute made up more than 50 of total solute mass except in the smallest 10 mm storm for the 10 mm storm impervious solute was always a majority although the proportion of low vegetation solute did increase after the rising limb consistent with other storms in addition to consistency through storm events the trend of high contributions from impervious areas at the beginning of storms and increasing contributions from low vegetation areas later on was true for all land use scenarios 3 3 solute arrival times from zones with different slope and land use the 0 021 km2 test zones tracked tracer from contrasting slope and land uses and showed that impervious land cover generated more runoff more quickly regardless of slope fig 10 and 11 si fig 6 7 during the 10 mm storm fig 10 an order of magnitude less solute was mobilized from any of the zones located on the field land use 0 impervious than was mobilized from zones on the school 72 73 impervious this missing runoff phenomenon only occurs in the two smaller less intense storm events the 10 mm storm fig 10 and the 2 peak storm si fig 6 which suggests that the pervious area was able to infiltrate the rainfall from smaller events but not the entirety of rainfall from larger events we compared solute mobilized from impervious school zones as well and found that higher slope led to a higher peak and steeper rising limb fig 10 while this result is expected the solute tracer tool demonstrates a method to quantify differences we did not use the neighborhood for zone comparisons as it had variable percent imperviousness during the larger real storm event solute mass arrived at the model outlet over a period of 3 h fig 11 we compared solute arrival time and peak mass from the high slope and low slope zones in the school and in the field in contrast to the smaller storm fig 10 solute mobilized from the field was observed to increase with higher slope although the peak was delayed compared to solute from the more proximal low slope zone fig 11 with more overall rainfall and runoff the difference between solute mobilized in the 72 73 impervious school zone when it was on the high slope versus the low slope zone was less significant fig 11 in all four storm events fig 10 and 11 si fig 6 7 the highest solute mass was mobilized when the high slope zone was collocated with the high percent impervious school sfn scenario 4 discussion we examined four questions with our distributed parameter overland runoff model whether percent imperviousness is directly related to overland runoff quantity and quality whether disconnecting impervious surfaces causes a decrease in modeled discharge whether smaller storm events enable more variability between source areas and whether and when low vegetation areas are important to overall overland runoff generation these questions center on explaining non linear rainfall runoff responses in urban watersheds and we used the model to quantify our assumptions about variability in runoff generation from impervious catchments the variation in overland runoff and solute amount from zones with different land use was not predicted by percent imperviousness and variability was more significant among low slope zones the relationship between imperviousness and solute mass to estimate runoff was not linear fig 12 for example the zones with school land use had very similar percent imperviousness 72 73 but varied in the amount of solute mass they generated with the high slope area producing 10 to 38 more than the low slope area furthermore the neighborhood generated between 10 and 53 lower solute than the school despite having only 10 lower impervious cover differing runoff responses from zones with the same slope and similar percent impervious cover suggest that in addition to slope the configuration of impervious areas impacts runoff generation however as expected the field zones always generated the least solute and had the lowest impervious area creating the appearance of a linear relationship thus a positive correlation can be generalized between imperviousness and solute mobilization overland runoff generation when low imperviousness is included which fits with literature by schueler et al 2009 kim et al 2016 li et al 2019 however as described in studies by jacobson et al 2011 and saadi et al 2020 there is significant variation in the amount of runoff generated by zones with similar percent impervious cover some variations we find can be explained by swi in that low slope zones for infiltration and more variation with rainfall types than high slope zones circles versus triangles in fig 12 these examples show why percent imperviousness should not be used as the sole predictor for runoff estimations despite assumptions that disconnecting all impervious areas from the model s outlet would reduce overall runoff the nsf scenario had the second highest runoff amount even though the field was closest to the outlet fig 5 in contrast in every rainfall event the fns scenario produced the least runoff even while it had the most impervious areas near the model outlet as discussed above the northern part of the catchment was the steepest and the most consistently runoff generating portion of the model so capturing runoff there with a pervious field likely decreased overall discharge the ability of a distal infiltration zone to decrease runoff at the model outlet emphasizes the need for careful placement of scms as their location can be optimized by putting them in the areas most likely to consistently generate runoff previous studies using gssha highlight the variability of scm performance with location smith et al 2015 fry maxwell 2017 and we expand on this finding by determining that slope may be an additional tool for evaluating scm success even for small variations in slope median slope in the catchment was just 2 2 variability in the amount of overland runoff from impervious surfaces for different storms and land use configurations fig 8 poses issues for determining overall pollutant concentrations with event mean concentrations emcs which assume an entire catchment contributes evenly to overland runoff pollutant concentration at the catchment outlet is estimated by multiplying emcs of a pollutant for each land cover by the percent of that land cover in the catchment although there is variability in reported emc values from site to site lin 2004 we used values from the pennsylvania department of environmental protection stormwater manual which provides emcs for specific land uses observed in the model area pennsylvania department of environmental protection 2016 we used padep emcs for parking lots and for athletic fields simplifying by using only the two largest land use areas in the model to calculate the overall pollutant concentration at the outlet for each storm and each land use configuration si table 7 however the percent of runoff generated by the two predominant land use types impervious and low vegetation in each storm is not equal to the percent of that land cover in the catchment fig 8 we recalculated each storm s mean concentration based on the percent solute from the model output si table 8 instead of the mapped land cover in the model area these were calculated for total suspended solids total phosphorous and nitrate plus nitrite we found between 5 and 13 difference in recalculated pollutant concentration between the different land use configurations and between 15 and 32 difference due to storm event type fig 13 si fig 8 we compared these values to the overall pollutant concentrations calculated with the catchment land cover 54 pervious and 46 impervious normalized to just two land use types and found the estimates based on runoff modeling could be lower 76 or higher 105 for tss as well as for tp and no3 no2 fig 13 si fig 8 the 37 mm storm was closest to the values based on the catchment land cover although some values were higher and the 10 mm storm had the largest difference from predicted based on catchment land cover the nfs configuration had the highest pollutant concentrations and was closest to the catchment land cover value except for the 37 mm storm which overestimated pollutant concentrations relative to the catchment areas these differences showed that not all storms are alike and that the land use configuration influences pollutant estimates in runoff thus solute tracking in gssha can be used to quantify variable runoff generating areas and approximate fluctuating pollutant concentrations over the course of a storm the composition of solute in overland runoff changed from predominantly 71 to 99 impervious to more low vegetation 33 to 78 during the falling limb the relative importance of overland runoff from each area cannot be predicted by overall land use fig 9 however the overall mass of solute mobilized by impervious land uses was higher than total low vegetation solute mobilized so we can conclude that as we predicted impervious areas generate more runoff than low vegetation areas the relative importance of low vegetation areas increased not only through the duration of a storm but also as storms increased in size fig 8 however there is an exception to the positive correlation between storm size and contribution from low vegetation areas the 2 year storm for the majority of this event rain intensity was very low median intensity was 1 mm hr thus the relationship may be better described as higher intensity rain events causing more overland runoff from low vegetation areas although impervious areas were the largest contributors to overland runoff generation in our stormwater catchment model low vegetation areas were always significant and sometimes contributed nearly half of total overland runoff neglecting urban green spaces in favor of only controlling overland storm runoff from impervious surfaces is likely to be inadequate especially with climate trends which suggest that large storms in the northeastern us will increase in frequency and intensity huang et al 2017 5 conclusions the novel use of a solute tracer with the distributed parameter model gssha revealed sources of non linearity in the relationship between imperviousness and runoff volume and in the urban rainfall runoff ratio our model demonstrates the importance of land cover position rather than just land cover percent most notably because runoff was reduced more by moving the pervious field to the steeper north portion of the catchment than by using it to disconnect the impervious areas from the model outlet the variation in solute from percent impervious areas from 50 to 75 despite 54 catchment imperviousness contradicts the assumption that impervious cover can predict runoff amount we found that overall model discharge as well as runoff from specific locations and land uses varies as a result of slope land use configuration and storm type understanding the variation in contributing areas determines how water reaches storm pipes and also provides the initiating step in determining the likelihood of saturation excess flow both of which contribute to non linear storm responses additional modeling could be undertaken to investigate the most impactful areas to add pervious landcover especially before decisions about locating stormwater control measures are made the solute tracer can be tracked into the subsurface as well to further explore non hortonian flow not only does land use position and slope complicate the relationship between land cover percentages and overland runoff generation but it also poses problems for the use of emcs or grab samples for stormwater monitoring the ratio of overland runoff from impervious and low vegetation areas did not match the percentage of those areas in the catchment and consequently the calculated outlet concentrations based on modeled emc in overland runoff differed for changes in land use configuration and from storm to storm these differences raise concerns for predicting stormwater basin runoff capture based on emcs calculated from observed land use areas furthermore since the ratio of overland runoff from impervious and low vegetation areas varies over time individual grab samples are unlikely to be representative of overland runoff concentrations we recommend developing distributed parameter models and source tracking using gssha s solute transport function to better understand the movement of runoff and contaminants to stormwater control measures we found that with limited calibration gssha performed well and was able to closely match runoff volume and peak timing for a real storm additionally with gis it is possible to swap the positions of land uses throughout the catchment which we used to quantify the changes to runoff amount attributable to land use model simulations allowed for significant insight into the timing and variation of overland runoff in a heterogeneous urban catchment credit authorship contribution statement ashleigh n kirker

1885,we used the distributed hydrologic model gssha to simulate overland runoff from impervious and semi pervious low vegetation land covers in a 0 3 km2 urban catchment the model is hypothetical which allowed us to test alternative land use configurations and better understand the effects of urban heterogeneity to track the arrival of water to a stormwater basin inlet from distinct parts of the catchment we applied a conservative solute tracer to portions of the gridded model area a new application for gssha s contaminant transport module we rearranged the positions of pervious and impervious land uses over the catchment during four storm events and found that the portion of total runoff volume from impervious areas varied from 50 to 75 while the relative proportion of impervious cover remained constant at 54 we also applied solute to equal sized zones with different slopes and land uses and found that percent imperviousness did not predict solute mobilization furthermore variation in total runoff volume and peak discharge for different land use arrangements and storm sizes showed that percent imperviousness could not be used to estimate a runoff rainfall ratio fluctuating solute proportions over time suggested that grab samples might not be adequate for capturing average overland runoff chemistry we quantified factors contributing to non linearity in rainfall runoff responses from an urban watershed with stormwater infrastructure and determined that using models to find hotspots for stormwater infiltration and to explore resilience to future storm events can improve design and function of stormwater control measures keywords gssha urban runoff impervious surfaces distributed parameter model rainfallrunoff analysis event mean concentrations stormwater management 1 introduction imperviousness has been related to high peak flows and pollutant loads in urban runoff arnold gibbons 1996 schueler et al 2009 to mitigate these threats to stream health stormwater control measures scms are introduced estimating pollutant concentrations is important for designers of scms to evaluate or predict the effectiveness of their basins park et al 2009 mcnett et al 2011 but contaminant concentrations in urban runoff are difficult to determine due to heterogeneity in sources and land use complex connectivity in flow paths and uncertain rainfall runoff relationships in the urban environment brezonik and stadelmann 2002 shuster et al 2007 the effects scms seek to mitigate can be summarized by the urban stream syndrome flashy hydrographs contamination and low biodiversity walsh et al 2005 but imperviousness alone or the reduction in imperviousness produced by scms does not directly predict stream health lee heaney 2003 walsh et al 2022 hopkins et al 2015 furthermore pollutant loads are often estimated with event mean concentrations emcs which are based on the percentages of land uses in the catchment overall and emcs are used with varying success for scm planning and monitoring melcher horsburgh 2017 one aim of stormwater control measures is to reduce the amount of directly connected impervious area dcia in catchments dcia has been proposed as a metric for predicting runoff quantity and is potentially more effective than overall land use or imperviousness lee heaney 2003 because it focuses on impervious areas that are hydrologically connected to the catchment outlet i e not separated by any pervious land however the dcia concept assumes that runoff infiltrates in the vegetated zones between disconnected impervious areas which due to compaction and or saturation may not always be the case lim 2016 ebrahimian et al 2016 walsh et al 2022 found connected imperviousness to be a moderately good predictor of reactive phosphorus and stream biotic index whereas hopkins et al 2015 found that road density was the best metric for predicting hydrologic responses in urban watersheds both walsh et al and hopkins et al note that topography and soil permeability had impacts that caused heterogeneity in stream responses even in watersheds with similar road densities or dcia in contrast bell et al 2016 found that total imperviousness is a better predictor of overland runoff than the extent of imperviousness disconnecting with scms especially as scm effectiveness appears to vary depending on its placement on a landscape voter and loheide 2018 found that soil compaction drives the effectiveness of various scm types and that microtopography on a residential lot scale can lengthen runoff pathways they determined that the effectiveness of soil amendments for overland runoff reduction depends on their locations with amendments near impervious surfaces and on sloped yards being most effective voter and loheide 2020 variable source area vsa which describes areas which periodically generate saturation excess non hortonian overland flow was conceptualized as one explanation for non linear rainfall runoff responses lee delluer 1976 reasons for vsas developing include the presence of shallow subsurface restrictive layers e g stewart et al 2019 shallow water tables and steep hillslopes vsas were initially described for humid forested watersheds hewlett hibbert 1967 while in urban areas imperviousness and landscape alteration make the size and location of vsas more difficult to predict easton et al 2007 some urban areas do show variable source behavior such as extended hydrographs valeo et al 2001 which is attributed to the same saturation excess flow or quick interflow processes as are described in natural catchments however in urban areas with stormwater infrastructure additional non hortonian processes like fast flow through subsurface pipes also contribute to a non linear relationship between rainfall and runoff miles and band 2015 lim 2016 one tool used to predict the likelihood of vsas developing on hillslopes prone to saturation excess runoff betson 1964 hewlett hibbert 1967 is the topographic wetness index twi twi is calculated from the slope and upstream contributing area at a given point beven kirby 1978 burt butcher 1985 anderson et al 2015 who studied twi to identify saturation prone areas where denitrification might occur found periodically saturated areas vsas denitrification rates and twi were all closely related however twi correlates to not only saturation but also to observed soil moisture patterns especially when high resolution digital elevation data are used buchanan et al 2014 in urban catchments of baltimore and new york city studied by kelleher mcphillips 2019 the average twi at areas with reported flooding was higher than the average twi across the watersheds with imperviousness or dcia as inconsistent predictors of runoff quantity examining land use hydrologic connectivity vsa and rainfall events in combination may be necessary to understand urban runoff specifically tracking changes in soil moisture and runoff generation can help determine likely areas for saturation excess overland flow or areas that might contribute runoff inconsistently whether via the subsurface or not whether catchment connectivity is influenced by soil moisture and rainfall or whether soil moisture dynamics are influenced by connectivity and rainfall is difficult to untangle zhang shuster 2014 sytsma et al 2020 in short it is important to understand all of the processes that lead to variability in the runoff rainfall ratio and how they work in combination mcdonnell 2003 and how they change over time nippgen et al 2015 surface water models can be used to track the flow of runoff and contaminants across a landscape and to pinpoint the location of high soil moisture vsas or the ideal placements of scms easton et al 2008 smith et al 2015 an 11 4 ha catchment in finland was modeled using the us epa s swmm and contaminant washoff was simulated to determine which areas of the watershed contributed the most to nonpoint source pollution tuomela et al 2019 it was found that land use sources could be pinpointed for individual contaminants but the location of specific source areas could not be distinguished because swmm assigns parameters to regions not individual model cells unlike swmm the us army corps of engineers gridded surface subsurface hydrological analysis gssha model is fully distributed and so can be used to model the spatial heterogeneity of overland runoff and the extent and location of ponded water downer et al 2002 downer ogden 2004 gssha is also process based using governing equations to determine water fluxes process based models are preferred for applications which require an understanding of spatial and temporal variability fatichi et al 2016 since its inception gssha has been applied to urban watersheds because its spatially distributed parameters make it a good choice for modeling urban heterogeneity niedzialek ogden 2003 al areeq et al 2021 a severe flood in a 55 km2 texas watershed was modeled with gssha by sharif et al 2010 although the model was only minimally calibrated when rainfall was distributed accurately discharge from the 2004 storm event was reproduced correctly which is attributed to the model being both distributed and process based with fine resolution elevation and land characteristic data smaller watersheds like the 14 km2 dead run watershed near baltimore md can be simulated ogden et al 2011 modeling in dead run revealed that increases in imperviousness and drainage density caused increases in flood peaks but that peak flow is less affected in extreme events two urban watersheds in roanoke va were modeled with both swmm and gssha and the model was calibrated with 9 events gssha was found to be more effective at predicting the extent of flooding brendel et al 2021 beyond simulating flooding and streamflow in urban watersheds gssha can be used to investigate hypothetical scenarios for example smith et al 2015 modeled the same dead run watershed as described above ogden et al 2011 but focused on hypothetical changes in discharge when detention basins were removed or when compacted urban soils were replaced with natural soils with higher infiltration capacity notably it was found that the location of drainage basins altered their efficiency paudel et al 2011 determined that gssha was better suited for investigating future land use change in a synthetic watershed than lumped models however hypothetical applications of models in urban watersheds are not limited to gssha lee et al 2018 used lumped parameters of artificial hydrologic response elements to find the most effective placement of impervious and pervious areas for reducing peak flows and wang et al 2021 used swmm to test scenarios with different amounts of imperviousness we expand upon previous work investigating land use position and green infrastructure placement ogden et al 2011 paudel et al 2011 by altering the patterns of land use in a hypothetical catchment and identifying the areas responsible for generating runoff and mobilizing solutes in this study we focused on a well drained catchment with a deep 10 12 m water table and a network of subsurface drainage pipes we assumed that no saturation excess overland flow would be generated but nevertheless took inspiration from the vsa concept and examined how the locations that generate runoff might change during and between storms our goal for this study was to use a discrete parameter model of runoff generating areas to provide an understanding of heterogeneity in overland runoff we investigated four aspects of heterogeneity first we tested the assumption that percent imperviousness is directly related to runoff quantity and quality and proposed additional solutions for understanding land use in catchments second we questioned how disconnecting impervious areas would affect the amount of overland runoff and whether distancing thereby disconnecting impervious areas from the model outlet would reduce modeled discharge additionally as described by ogden et al 2011 we suspected that higher flows would reduce variability between land use scenarios so we used the model for storms of various sizes our fourth question related to the role of low vegetation areas such as fields and yards in urban catchments and we explored how their importance varied over the course of a hydrograph and for different land use distributions we set out to explain how variability in urban runoff is affected by factors beyond percent impervious cover and how variability in source areas for different storms and land use configurations contributes to non linear rainfall runoff relationships 2 methods 2 1 hypothetical catchment although the land use solute transport and storm events simulated in this study were hypothetical the size and shape of the watershed was based on a 0 30 km2 catchment in suburban philadelphia where a constructed stormwater retention basin drains runoff from the upper moreland middle school its athletic fields and a nearby neighborhood fig 1 we input elevation from a digital elevation model dem with 1 m resolution delaware valley regional planning commission 2016 and used surveyed land use classifications for our initial model runs university of vermont spatial analysis laboratory 2016 land use in the watershed was classified as tree canopy 13 barren 2 low vegetation defined as plants less than 2 m in height in this case mainly lawns 44 or impervious cover 41 soil was classified primarily as urban land pavement and areas with fill material and disturbed udorthents soil survey staff soil survey staff natural resources conservation service 2019 because natural resources conservation service soil maps show that soil type does not differ appreciably over the small catchment parameter variation was governed by land use we defined two test zones with distinct slopes in the catchment using the open source software qgis to calculate a metric of slope and catchment area the saga wetness index swi the swi like the more common twi is calculated from the specific catchment area sca or upstream area of a point in the dem and the slope to that point eq 1 the swi differs from the twi only in its calculation of sca and is thought to be more accurate for less steep catchments böhner selige 2006 this catchment ranges in elevation from 77 4 to 91 5 m above sea level and has a gentle slope mean 2 2 1 swi ln sca t a n s l o p e we observed patterns in the swi of the catchment and chose two equally sized zones which were the same approximate distance from the channel to test our hypotheses about the effects of slope and upstream capture area on runoff generation fig 2 in the east center of the catchment a high swi zone mean 6 53 was outlined and a zone of the same size and shape was outlined in the lower swi area in the northern part of the catchment mean 4 99 both zones cover an area of 0 021 km2 and the outline shape was determined by tracking runoff that did not reach the scm inlet from the low slope area si fig 1 compared to an overall average swi of 5 68 in the catchment these zones are notable for being more runoff receiving high swi and more runoff generating low swi respectively than the rest of the catchment these zones were used as source areas for flow paths but were not incorporated into the model for soil moisture calculations 2 2 gssha the us army corps of engineers aquavevo watershed modeling system wms was used for visualization and analysis and gssha was used to model overland flow channel flow and flow through a subsurface storm drainage network in gssha a watershed is divided into uniform grid cells and the path of water through each cell is calculated we simulated precipitation green ampt infiltration with soil moisture redistribution ogden and saghafian 1997 overland flow via 2d routing flow through channels with a diffusive wave equation flow through storm infrastructure solute transport and evapotranspiration with the penman method although infiltration was calculated no groundwater inputs or groundwater recharge was considered gssha can be used for 3 d models but because the scm inlet pipe the model s outlet is above the water table groundwater was left out so that we could focus on storm flow the 0 30 km2 catchment was divided into 5 m by 5 m grid cells with its outlet set at the location of a 1 1 m diameter storm pipe flowing into the stormwater retention basin at this location runoff volume and solute mass were output at 5 minute intervals as this model is hypothetical the storm drainage network was simplified and represented by a single drainage pipe with multiple inlets modeled with the superlink function in gssha which uses the conservation of mass to solve for pipe discharge ogden et al 2012 at the point where the storm drainage system joins the main road in the model where overland flow accumulation was found to be highest via wms topaz d8 flow routing a simplified trapezoidal channel feature 1 m deep with a minimum width of 2 m was used to model combined flow in the road and from the storm pipe system other roadways in the neighborhood section of the catchment do not have storm drainage and so are modeled as impervious surfaces where 2 dimensional overland flow is possible parameters were determined from literature sources and varied by land use type gssha 2016 aboufoul garcia 2017 papaioannou et al 2018 more detailed parameters are given in si table 1 but notably porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity were found to have a significant effect on peak discharge and were adjusted to better fit measured responses in the real catchment before hypothetical simulations began si fig 2 water which enters the model as rainfall is partitioned into infiltration or overland flow which can also be routed to storm pipes during a rain event evapotranspiration does not occur in gssha although direct evaporation of ponded water during dry periods is possible in our scenarios it accounted for less than 0 04 total water volume overland runoff depth and solute mass was recorded at each grid cell every 15 min once generated overland runoff can enter subsurface pipes superlink or flow directly to the channel water in the subsurface pipes is also routed to the channel where channel flow is calculated in one dimension via the explicit diffusive wave method with manning s roughness set to 0 07 downer ogden 2004 channel flow arrives at the model s output analogous to the inlet pipe of the scm where it becomes discharge to measure the arrival time of water from distinct portions of the watersheds we employed gssha s contaminant transport function with a conservative non reactive solute with this tool a chemograph showing mass of the applied solute at the watershed s outlet over time is produced travel times and runoff amounts from specified surface areas of interest e g impervious grid cells or a subsection of the catchment where slope is very low can be compared by applying solute to each area gssha allows solute to be placed on the land surface and taken up by water which is running off of or infiltrating into the land at a rate dependent on its solubility for consistency an initial value of 25 kg m3 solute on the surface was set with the solute s solubility set to 36000 mg l so that it would be readily dissolved this tracer mass allowed visualization of flow paths and does not represent any specific contaminants solute arrival and mass amount was used to approximate overland runoff arrival and amount to compare and standardize solute transport when solute was distributed over non uniform areas solute masses µg are reported normalized over the initial mass present in the model kg when solute was applied to the high slope and low slope zones an equal number of cells received solute so normalization was not necessary 2 3 rainfall events we simulated four storm events with precipitation totals ranging from 10 mm to 84 mm first a real storm with hourly precipitation data from a weather underground personal weather station kpawillo10 https www wunderground com was recorded and water level data were collected from the stormwater inlet pipe in the scm that storm real event had a duration of 9 h and a total accumulation of 37 mm additionally three hypothetical storms were created with the timeseries editor in wms the largest was a 24 hour design storm with a 2 year recurrence interval noaa 2017 with 10 min rainfall data following a nrcs type ii distribution a storm with 2 rainfall peaks was created to illustrate the effects of antecedent moisture using hourly rainfall data because most storms in southeastern pa are small pennsylvania department of environmental protection 2016 we also created a 10 mm low intensity storm event fig 3 si table 2 with rainfall distributed in 6 minute intervals due to the small size of the catchment a single gage was used to input rainfall into gssha the personal weather station is limited in accuracy and resolution producing hourly rainfall totals but for the 2 year and 10 mm storms we used a finer rainfall interval given that the timing of response was not the focus of this model the different resolutions of the rainfall data should not affect interpretations 2 4 land use variation land use raster files university of vermont spatial analysis laboratory 2016 were imported into arcgis for manipulation we observed three main areas of the original land use map the upper moreland middle school school with its parking lots buildings and sidewalks the athletic fields field associated with it and the neighborhood to the north these three land use blocks school field and neighborhood were extracted in arcgis and their positions on the landscape were swapped to ensure that low vegetation and impervious land covers remained in the same proportion in each case an adjustment of the real map was made to include more impervious cover in the school section and remove some impervious cover in the field section but the proportions were similar for modeled and observed land use in the model impervious cover is 49 compared to 41 in reality for our hypothetical land use scenarios we used a scenario similar to the real map neighborhood in the north field in the middle and school in the south or nfs a sfn school in the north neighborhood in the south scenario nsf neighborhood in the north field in the south and fns field in the north school in the south scenario fig 4 for each scenario land use portions were kept approximately constant with 49 impervious cover 41 low vegetation semi pervious 9 tree canopy and the remaining 1 barren ground si table 3 in contrast land use in the low and high slope 0 021 km2 zones varies significantly between land use scenarios for example low vegetation percentages in these zones range from 11 to 100 si table 3 although a total of 6 possible land use scenarios the four listed above and additionally fsn and snf were identified for ease of comparison and because land use in the s and n sections had similar imperviousness we limited our study to these 4 scenarios nfs sfn nsf and fns which cover each section s placement in each position 3 results 3 1 comparing peak flow and runoff volume between land use scenarios for each storm event and land use simulation the input from precipitation and output from infiltration evaporation and overland outflow were recorded and a mass balance of water in the model was validated the water mass balance error was 0 in all rainfall and land use scenarios and less than 1 6 of rainfall volume remained on the surface at the end of each model run mean 0 4 direct evaporation during storm events accounted for less than 0 5 of all output water and less than 0 04 of water traveled through the superlink storm drain network before entering the channel in each modeled run in each of the 16 modeled scenarios between 31 and 69 water infiltrated while 30 68 exited the model as discharge via the channel to the outlet si table 6 peak discharge m3 s and total runoff volume m3 increased with increasing rainfall accumulation and maximum rainfall intensity was also correlated with peak discharge m3 s and total runoff volume m3 si fig 3 however the storms with the highest rainfall accumulation also had the highest rainfall intensity so whether accumulation intensity or both drove the correlation is unclear si fig 3 the relationship between rainfall amount and intensity and runoff volume and peak magnitude was consistent among land use scenarios although the greatest variation between scenarios was observed for peak discharge at the highest precipitation amount in all four rain events the fns land use scenario had the lowest total runoff volume producing between 1 and 4 lower volume than other scenarios produced fig 5 even though the nsf land use scenario had a field with relatively high infiltration which disconnected impervious areas from the model outlet nsf produced the most total runoff volume and peak discharge during the largest storm 2 year event in 2 of the 3 other events the nfs scenario produced the most total discharge the largest discharge was produced when an impervious land use school or neighborhood occupied the most distal northernmost portion of the model regardless of the land uses in the middle or southern parts of the model a paired one tailed t test on discharge produced by the fns scenarios compared to the average discharge produced by the other 3 scenarios with an impervious area in the north suggested that there was a significant difference between the two groups p 0 052 3 2 solute arrival from impervious and low vegetation areas in every storm event and land use scenario more solute from impervious surfaces arrived at the model outlet than solute from low vegetation areas figs 6 and 7 si fig 4 and 5 si table 4 and 5 the first arrival time of each solute at the model outlet and the solute peak time provide additional travel time indicators during storms in the nfs fns and sfn scenarios the impervious solute usually began arriving before the low vegetation solute but peak times between the two solutes only differ by 5 15 min the impervious chemograph also had a rising limb that is typically steeper suggests that solute is mobilized more readily from impervious areas the gap between impervious and low vegetation peak times and arrival times is illustrated in the chemographs for each solute from the 2 peak event fig 7 in the sfn scenario where there is a low vegetation field near the model outlet the low vegetation solute began arriving at the model outlet first but it did not peak before the impervious solute during the event with the highest rainfall amount and intensity the 2 year storm impervious solute and low vegetation solute peaked around the same time 12 1 h after rainfall began but the maximum of the low vegetation peak was higher in the 2 year storm the average low vegetation peak magnitude among all land use scenarios was between 7 and 17 higher than the impervious solute peak although the total amount of impervious solute mobilized was still higher by between 36 and 73 si table 4 due to the high amount of rainfall and the storm s long duration some overbank flow occurred in the channel and a small secondary peak can be observed fig 6 in contrast during the smallest 10 mm storm the amount of impervious solute mobilized was higher both cumulatively and at the peak for all land use scenarios si fig 4 and si table 4 show that impervious mass is more than 100 higher than low vegetation mass in the 2 peak event we compared the heights of the low vegetation and impervious solutes earliest and later hydrograph peaks we found that the difference in peak magnitude between impervious and low vegetation was larger for the first peak than for the second during the 2 peak storm fig 7 si table 4 for example for the nfs scenario during the first peak of the 2 peak storm the impervious solute peak was 151 higher than the low vegetation but only 35 higher during the second larger peak which we attributed to saturation in the low vegetation areas this trend was not observed for the 2 year design event 83 mm storm where the first peak arrived after 12 h of rainfall and generally had similar within 6 23 higher or lower amounts of impervious and low vegetation solutes fig 6 si table 4 we also found that in the 2 peak storm the second peak mobilized more solute overall even though less rain 10 mm instead of 20 mm fell immediately preceding that peak we investigated contributing areas among different land use configurations for each storm event and found that solute from low vegetation made up from 25 to 50 of total solute mobilized fig 8 this range contrasts with the model area which had 46 low vegetation when normalized to just two land use types where solute was applied the smallest storm had the most difference between impervious and low vegetation with low vegetation solute making up 30 of total solute mass and it follows 30 total runoff generated and impervious solute making up a significant majority at 70 fig 8 the amount of solute from impervious and low vegetation areas became more comparable with increasing storm size with 48 from low vegetation and 52 from impervious during the 37 mm real event storm however the trend of increasing low vegetation contributions with increasing precipitation is not true for the largest storm event possibly because of the hours of low intensity precipitation preceding the storm peak fig 6 the smallest storms also had the most variation 8 9 compared to only 5 variation for bigger storms between the amounts of solute generated by low vegetation cells in various land use scenarios our distributed parameter model supports the hypothesis that variation caused by land use is most significant during small storm events although additional uncertainty is introduced by the variety of rainfall time steps used in the modeled storm events 6 min 1 h the dominant land use contributing to overland runoff also shifted from impervious to low vegetation over the course of rain events as indicated by the percent of the total solute mass at a given timestep made up by low vegetation or impervious solute fig 9 during the rising limb of every storm the percentage of impervious solute was higher than the percentage of low vegetation solute for example in the hours preceding the peak of the 37 mm real event storm between 50 76 solute on average 62 originated in impervious areas fig 9 following the peak the percent of solute from low vegetation areas increased and during the falling limb of most hydrographs low vegetation solute made up more than 50 of total solute mass except in the smallest 10 mm storm for the 10 mm storm impervious solute was always a majority although the proportion of low vegetation solute did increase after the rising limb consistent with other storms in addition to consistency through storm events the trend of high contributions from impervious areas at the beginning of storms and increasing contributions from low vegetation areas later on was true for all land use scenarios 3 3 solute arrival times from zones with different slope and land use the 0 021 km2 test zones tracked tracer from contrasting slope and land uses and showed that impervious land cover generated more runoff more quickly regardless of slope fig 10 and 11 si fig 6 7 during the 10 mm storm fig 10 an order of magnitude less solute was mobilized from any of the zones located on the field land use 0 impervious than was mobilized from zones on the school 72 73 impervious this missing runoff phenomenon only occurs in the two smaller less intense storm events the 10 mm storm fig 10 and the 2 peak storm si fig 6 which suggests that the pervious area was able to infiltrate the rainfall from smaller events but not the entirety of rainfall from larger events we compared solute mobilized from impervious school zones as well and found that higher slope led to a higher peak and steeper rising limb fig 10 while this result is expected the solute tracer tool demonstrates a method to quantify differences we did not use the neighborhood for zone comparisons as it had variable percent imperviousness during the larger real storm event solute mass arrived at the model outlet over a period of 3 h fig 11 we compared solute arrival time and peak mass from the high slope and low slope zones in the school and in the field in contrast to the smaller storm fig 10 solute mobilized from the field was observed to increase with higher slope although the peak was delayed compared to solute from the more proximal low slope zone fig 11 with more overall rainfall and runoff the difference between solute mobilized in the 72 73 impervious school zone when it was on the high slope versus the low slope zone was less significant fig 11 in all four storm events fig 10 and 11 si fig 6 7 the highest solute mass was mobilized when the high slope zone was collocated with the high percent impervious school sfn scenario 4 discussion we examined four questions with our distributed parameter overland runoff model whether percent imperviousness is directly related to overland runoff quantity and quality whether disconnecting impervious surfaces causes a decrease in modeled discharge whether smaller storm events enable more variability between source areas and whether and when low vegetation areas are important to overall overland runoff generation these questions center on explaining non linear rainfall runoff responses in urban watersheds and we used the model to quantify our assumptions about variability in runoff generation from impervious catchments the variation in overland runoff and solute amount from zones with different land use was not predicted by percent imperviousness and variability was more significant among low slope zones the relationship between imperviousness and solute mass to estimate runoff was not linear fig 12 for example the zones with school land use had very similar percent imperviousness 72 73 but varied in the amount of solute mass they generated with the high slope area producing 10 to 38 more than the low slope area furthermore the neighborhood generated between 10 and 53 lower solute than the school despite having only 10 lower impervious cover differing runoff responses from zones with the same slope and similar percent impervious cover suggest that in addition to slope the configuration of impervious areas impacts runoff generation however as expected the field zones always generated the least solute and had the lowest impervious area creating the appearance of a linear relationship thus a positive correlation can be generalized between imperviousness and solute mobilization overland runoff generation when low imperviousness is included which fits with literature by schueler et al 2009 kim et al 2016 li et al 2019 however as described in studies by jacobson et al 2011 and saadi et al 2020 there is significant variation in the amount of runoff generated by zones with similar percent impervious cover some variations we find can be explained by swi in that low slope zones for infiltration and more variation with rainfall types than high slope zones circles versus triangles in fig 12 these examples show why percent imperviousness should not be used as the sole predictor for runoff estimations despite assumptions that disconnecting all impervious areas from the model s outlet would reduce overall runoff the nsf scenario had the second highest runoff amount even though the field was closest to the outlet fig 5 in contrast in every rainfall event the fns scenario produced the least runoff even while it had the most impervious areas near the model outlet as discussed above the northern part of the catchment was the steepest and the most consistently runoff generating portion of the model so capturing runoff there with a pervious field likely decreased overall discharge the ability of a distal infiltration zone to decrease runoff at the model outlet emphasizes the need for careful placement of scms as their location can be optimized by putting them in the areas most likely to consistently generate runoff previous studies using gssha highlight the variability of scm performance with location smith et al 2015 fry maxwell 2017 and we expand on this finding by determining that slope may be an additional tool for evaluating scm success even for small variations in slope median slope in the catchment was just 2 2 variability in the amount of overland runoff from impervious surfaces for different storms and land use configurations fig 8 poses issues for determining overall pollutant concentrations with event mean concentrations emcs which assume an entire catchment contributes evenly to overland runoff pollutant concentration at the catchment outlet is estimated by multiplying emcs of a pollutant for each land cover by the percent of that land cover in the catchment although there is variability in reported emc values from site to site lin 2004 we used values from the pennsylvania department of environmental protection stormwater manual which provides emcs for specific land uses observed in the model area pennsylvania department of environmental protection 2016 we used padep emcs for parking lots and for athletic fields simplifying by using only the two largest land use areas in the model to calculate the overall pollutant concentration at the outlet for each storm and each land use configuration si table 7 however the percent of runoff generated by the two predominant land use types impervious and low vegetation in each storm is not equal to the percent of that land cover in the catchment fig 8 we recalculated each storm s mean concentration based on the percent solute from the model output si table 8 instead of the mapped land cover in the model area these were calculated for total suspended solids total phosphorous and nitrate plus nitrite we found between 5 and 13 difference in recalculated pollutant concentration between the different land use configurations and between 15 and 32 difference due to storm event type fig 13 si fig 8 we compared these values to the overall pollutant concentrations calculated with the catchment land cover 54 pervious and 46 impervious normalized to just two land use types and found the estimates based on runoff modeling could be lower 76 or higher 105 for tss as well as for tp and no3 no2 fig 13 si fig 8 the 37 mm storm was closest to the values based on the catchment land cover although some values were higher and the 10 mm storm had the largest difference from predicted based on catchment land cover the nfs configuration had the highest pollutant concentrations and was closest to the catchment land cover value except for the 37 mm storm which overestimated pollutant concentrations relative to the catchment areas these differences showed that not all storms are alike and that the land use configuration influences pollutant estimates in runoff thus solute tracking in gssha can be used to quantify variable runoff generating areas and approximate fluctuating pollutant concentrations over the course of a storm the composition of solute in overland runoff changed from predominantly 71 to 99 impervious to more low vegetation 33 to 78 during the falling limb the relative importance of overland runoff from each area cannot be predicted by overall land use fig 9 however the overall mass of solute mobilized by impervious land uses was higher than total low vegetation solute mobilized so we can conclude that as we predicted impervious areas generate more runoff than low vegetation areas the relative importance of low vegetation areas increased not only through the duration of a storm but also as storms increased in size fig 8 however there is an exception to the positive correlation between storm size and contribution from low vegetation areas the 2 year storm for the majority of this event rain intensity was very low median intensity was 1 mm hr thus the relationship may be better described as higher intensity rain events causing more overland runoff from low vegetation areas although impervious areas were the largest contributors to overland runoff generation in our stormwater catchment model low vegetation areas were always significant and sometimes contributed nearly half of total overland runoff neglecting urban green spaces in favor of only controlling overland storm runoff from impervious surfaces is likely to be inadequate especially with climate trends which suggest that large storms in the northeastern us will increase in frequency and intensity huang et al 2017 5 conclusions the novel use of a solute tracer with the distributed parameter model gssha revealed sources of non linearity in the relationship between imperviousness and runoff volume and in the urban rainfall runoff ratio our model demonstrates the importance of land cover position rather than just land cover percent most notably because runoff was reduced more by moving the pervious field to the steeper north portion of the catchment than by using it to disconnect the impervious areas from the model outlet the variation in solute from percent impervious areas from 50 to 75 despite 54 catchment imperviousness contradicts the assumption that impervious cover can predict runoff amount we found that overall model discharge as well as runoff from specific locations and land uses varies as a result of slope land use configuration and storm type understanding the variation in contributing areas determines how water reaches storm pipes and also provides the initiating step in determining the likelihood of saturation excess flow both of which contribute to non linear storm responses additional modeling could be undertaken to investigate the most impactful areas to add pervious landcover especially before decisions about locating stormwater control measures are made the solute tracer can be tracked into the subsurface as well to further explore non hortonian flow not only does land use position and slope complicate the relationship between land cover percentages and overland runoff generation but it also poses problems for the use of emcs or grab samples for stormwater monitoring the ratio of overland runoff from impervious and low vegetation areas did not match the percentage of those areas in the catchment and consequently the calculated outlet concentrations based on modeled emc in overland runoff differed for changes in land use configuration and from storm to storm these differences raise concerns for predicting stormwater basin runoff capture based on emcs calculated from observed land use areas furthermore since the ratio of overland runoff from impervious and low vegetation areas varies over time individual grab samples are unlikely to be representative of overland runoff concentrations we recommend developing distributed parameter models and source tracking using gssha s solute transport function to better understand the movement of runoff and contaminants to stormwater control measures we found that with limited calibration gssha performed well and was able to closely match runoff volume and peak timing for a real storm additionally with gis it is possible to swap the positions of land uses throughout the catchment which we used to quantify the changes to runoff amount attributable to land use model simulations allowed for significant insight into the timing and variation of overland runoff in a heterogeneous urban catchment credit authorship contribution statement ashleigh n kirker

1886,the drastic spatial and temporal variations of water resources are one of the causes of the fragile ecological environment in the bayin river basin while the temporal variation is less predictable a detailed spatial distribution of hydrological parameters of the basin is invaluable for developing guidance for allocating and utilizing water resources in the bayin river basin this study estimates the two dimensional spatial distribution of hydraulic diffusivity d of the bayin river basin through the relationship between river flow and groundwater using limited available river stages data along the river it first conducted a wavelet analysis to illustrate strong correlations between river flow and groundwater during the flood season in the basin subsequently it used a simple linear model to estimate temporal and spatial variations of the river stage along the river due to flood then the study applied a recently developed river stage tomography rst to the alluvial fan to estimate the spatial distribution of the d values the rst treats the flood river stage as a signal pressure transmitter and the groundwater fluctuation recorded in the observation wells as the images of the aquifer heterogeneity between the river and observation wells the rst then synthesizes these images to characterize the heterogeneous distribution of d in the alluvial fan in the bayin river basin the results show that the northeast area of the alluvial fan has a relatively high d while the d is relatively low in the tail and the southwest area of the fan these findings are consistent with the general concept of alluvial fan evolution moreover the predicted groundwater levels during the flood event in 2019 based on the rst estimated d is more accurate than the preliminary stratigraphic survey confirming that capturing groundwater responses at various parts of a basin caused by some disturbances could reveal hydraulic connectivity which the prior geologic information cannot this result is essential to advancing aquifer characterization technologies and affirming the contribution of rst and the view toward the future subsurface sciences advocated by yeh et al 2008 keywords river stage tomography hydraulic diffusivity aquifer characterize wavelet analysis data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the bayin river originates from the lianshan water system in the northern part of the qaidam basin in china yang et al 2021 bayin river basin is fragile in the eco environment and has unevenly distributed water resources in time and space hang et al 2019 the river flood has frequently been a hazard for surrounding residents while recharging the groundwater this situation mandates effectively managing water resources and preventing flood disasters which demand comprehensive hydrogeological surveys in the bayin river basin traditional hydrological tests to characterize aquifers such as pumping tests assume that the aquifers tested are homogeneous this assumption is inconsistent with the actual situation where aquifers are heterogeneous at various scales james et al 1993 moreover the test uses groundwater responses at one well i e a point in a heterogeneous aquifer to infer the property of the entire aquifer wu et al 2005 claimed that the tests compare apples and oranges yielding biased and unrealistic aquifer properties to solve these problems yeh and liu 2000 developed a geostatistical based hydraulic tomography ht which can yield the heterogeneous distribution of hydraulic conductivity and specific storage values and their uncertainty cost effectively in effect ht evolves from our common sense examining an object from different perspectives like the medical cat scan and geophysical imaging technologies ht injects or extracts water from aquifers at one well to create excitation and uses monitoring wells to capture the excitation as they travel through aquifer heterogeneity between the pumping and monitoring wells repeating this operation at different pumping and monitoring wells ht collects the aquifer heterogeneity information from different perspectives many e g bohling et al 2007 cardiff et al 2013 fienen et al 2008 liu and kitanidis 2011 brauchler et al 2003 yeh and liu 2000 luo et al 2022 had developed ht interpretation methods the successive linear estimator sle algorithm xiang 2007 yeh et al 1995 yeh et al 1996 yeh et al 2002 zhu and yeh 2005 has been widely and successfully applied to many numerical laboratory and field experiments sle is an iterative geostatistical estimation method evolving from kriging and cokriging estimator unlike these linear estimators sle successively updates the estimate and its covariance function to include the nonlinear relationship between hydraulic characteristics and observation information since the last century many have applied the hydraulic tomography theory to characterize the hydraulic conductivity field and storativity field of heterogeneous aquifers examples include numerical simulation studies sun et al 2013 xiang et al 2009 zha et al 2018 zhu and yeh 2005 laboratory sandboxes and fractured rocks experiments illman et al 2012 2007 2010 jiang et al 2020 and field studies berg and illman 2011 bohling et al 2007 cardiff et al 2013 huang et al 2011 illman et al 2009 wen et al 2019 zha et al 2017 zhao and illman 2018 all these studies confirmed that ht with sle can effectively characterize the spatial distribution of hydraulic parameters in aquifers more recently daranond et al 2020 and liu et al 2020 demonstrated that ht can detect groundwater basin shape and boundary conditions in numerical and field examples kuhlman et al 2008 demonstrated the feasibility of conducting a series of ht tests in a basin scale aquifer using a numerical experiment exploiting pump and treat remediation systems as an ht zha et al 2019 characterized a basin scale aquifer in tucson arizona liu et al 2020 took advantage of regional reduction of groundwater withdrawal programs to identify the heterogeneity and boundary conditions in a basin in china using artificial stimuli to create basin scale ht excitations is difficult yeh et al 2008 proposed using recurrent natural events precipitation flood earthquake and lightning for basin scale tomographic surveys to characterize groundwater basins subsequently yeh et al 2009 developed the rst exploring the migration of flood waves as a stimulus for ht and demonstrated its feasibility wang et al 2017 applied the rst to an alluvial fan in taiwan using numerical experiments wang et al 2021 showed that a migrating single flood wave is more effective than the periodic river stage fluctuations for characterizing the aquifer heterogeneity the concept of rst is relatively new and its applications to real world scenarios are limited more applications validating and promoting this new technology are relevant to improve new technologies and better managing our precious water resources for this reason this article applied the rst to the bayin river basin in china to further test this new technology first we use wavelet analysis to analyze the time series of the bayin river flow and groundwater the river flows and groundwater levels during periods with high cross correlation between them were selected as the inversion dataset in addition the cross correlation analysis between the groundwater head and the river flow was used to make a preliminary inference on the hydraulic diffusivity d field afterward we constructed a large scale groundwater flow model for rst to estimate the d field and tested the estimates by predicting the groundwater flow field during different flood events 2 site description the china geological survey conducted a massive field reconnaissance in bayin river basin for groundwater head monitoring twenty four observation wells of different depths were implemented in the basin fig 1 these monitoring wells are mainly in the middle reaches of the bayin river basin and the rest are scattered around delingha uplift and gahai lake the depths of these monitoring wells are about 10 m 180 m depending on the groundwater depth since the installation of these monitoring wells in 2016 groundwater head and temperature data in the wells have been collected hourly among these monitoring wells we selected 14 wells with minimal disturbance for this study marked with a yellow background in fig 1 the two inverted red triangles represent the river flow monitoring stations that collect daily bayin river flow data besides remote sensing surveys pumping tests borehole sampling and other work provide references for this research therefore the bayin river basin has sufficient information for the river stage tomography 2 1 topography the altitude of the terrain from north to south is from 2808 to 5030 m mountains to the north hills to the south and the delingha uplift in the middle divide the alluvial plain into two parts han et al 2020 the water stored in the north of the basin is ampler than that in the south the terrain of the basin controls the meander of the groundwater movement the bayin river recharges groundwater along the way and eventually flows into crook lake through the river and underground flow 2 2 geology the xi an geological survey center of china geological survey conducted a detailed investigation of the hydrogeology of the bayin river basin in the past years cheng et al 2019 wen et al 2018 han et al 2020 yang et al 2021 the geological survey reveals that the bayin river basin piedmont plain comprises an alluvial proluvial plain and an alluvial lacustrine plain the groundwater is distributed horizontally along the morphological facies zones which is consistent with the distribution characteristics of groundwater in the arid inland basin alluvial fan yang et al 2021 the alluvial proluvial plain dominated by phreatic aquifers is a crucial groundwater reservoir in the bayin river basin the phreatic aquifers originated north and developed to the south in a fan shaped distribution with 80 m in depth the stratum is loose with large pores high hydraulic conductivity high water abundance and high hydraulic connection the distribution of sediments follows sand gravel argillaceous sand gravel and sandy mudstone from the apex to the tail of the alluvial proluvial plains the alluvial lacustrine plain distributed south of the alluvial proluvial plain with banded distribution comprises confined aquifers with a depth of 20 180 m owing to sedimentary conditions at the junction with the alluvial fan the upper aquifer is sand gravel and the lower part is a silty fine sand layer geological processes such as uplift denudation and sedimentation thin out the aquifer at the tail of the alluvial lacustrine plain 3 theory and method theoretically the rst requires a relationship between the river and groundwater head however the noise such as human activities e g irrigation drainage etc and natural influences e g rainfall evaporation etc could corrupt data misleading our estimation of the distribution of d diffusivity in aquifers as such we used the wavelet coherence wtc analysis to select the period with a high correlation between the river flow and the groundwater field to eliminate the data noise caused by unwanted factors baddoo et al 2015 grinsted et al 2004 yin et al 2011 the wtc code is provided by grinsted et al 2004 for wavelet analysis a morlet wavelet is defined as the mother wavelet 1 ψ 0 n π 1 4 e i ω 0 η e 1 2 η 2 where ω0 is dimensionless frequency and η is dimensionless time generally the morlet wavelet with ω0 6 has a good balance between the time and the frequency localization and can effectively carry out continuous wavelet transform cwt grinsted et al 2004 also presented a wavelet coherent calculation fourier squared coherency analysis that identifies the frequency bands within which time series are co varying baddoo et al 2015 specifically wtc finds the period where the time series correlate well in the time frequency space yu et al 2007 yao et al 2018 following the wtc analysis a stochastic parameter estimator i e successive linear estimator sle utilizes the river stage groundwater data and governing groundwater flow equation to estimate the spatial distribution of hydraulic properties over the groundwater basin sle is an inversion algorithm based on a geostatistical concept available at https tian hwr arizona edu downloads or contact stochasticfusion gmail com sle decomposes a nonlinear estimation problem into a linear one and iteratively utilizes the linear spatial autocorrelation between parameters and the cross correlation between parameters and observations with updated autocorrelation and cross correlation yeh et al 1996 provided a detailed discussion of sle the following is a brief presentation of the sle the governing equation of groundwater flow in saturated porous media is 2 k h s s h t subject to boundary and initial conditions 3 h γ h 1 and h t 0 h 0 where k is hydraulic conductivity ss is specific storage h is the total head h1 is the prescribed total head at head boundary γ and h0 represents the initial total head eq 2 can also be written as the groundwater diffusion equation 4 d h h t where d is hydraulic diffusivity in this study the spatial distribution of d will be characterized by the variation of h in response to the riverstage change the calculation formula for the estimated d of spatial variation is 5 u c r 1 u c r ω r t d d r where u c r is an n 1 vector representing perturbations of lnd to be estimated at n locations the superscript r is the iteration index when r 0 the value of u c 0 represents the guessed prior or initial lnd field based on geological exploration information d is a m 1vector representing m observed heads at observation wells d r represents the simulated heads at the observation wells based on the lnd estimated from the previous iteration the estimated u is adjusted by the difference between d and d r in each iteration step and the weight coefficient matrix ω is determined by solving the following equation 6 ε dd λ diag ε dd ω ε du where ε dd and ε du are the covariance matrix of d and the covariance matrix between d and u respectively λ is the dynamic multiplier of the levenberg marquardt algorithm and diag operator represents the diagonal matrix the covariance and cross covariance are obtained by first order analysis using the sensitivity calculated by the adjoint equation 7 ε dd r j du r ε u u r j du r t 8 ε du r j du r ε uu r where j du r is the sensitivity matrix of the d to the changes of u the parameter covariance matrix ε uu r is given by the prior geological information when r 0 and is gradually updated in each iteration according to the following formula to derive the residual covariance 9 ε uu r 1 ε uu r ω r t ε du r the mean square error l2 is used to estimate the error between the observed and simulated values 10 l 2 1 m i 1 m d i d i r 2 4 result and analysis 4 1 wavelet analysis the time series and wavelet amplitude spectrograms between the river flow and the groundwater fluctuation at all available observation wells from may 2017 to december 2018 were analyzed in particular wells d11 and b48 were selected to investigate the relationship between groundwater fluctuation and river flow d11 is on a wasteland 3 5 km from the bayin river far away from cities and agricultural areas with minimal disturbance from human activities well b48 is 13 0 km from the bayin river and close to the delingha uplift with scattered farmland and villages the time series and the wtc map of the groundwater fluctuation and the river flow are illustrated in fig 2 a and 2 b respectively groundwater fluctuation at d11 increases monotonically with minor perturbations with a lag behind the changes in the river flow the groundwater variation is smoother than the river flow variation because the geological media between the river and the groundwater filters the high frequency signal of the river fluctuation wang et al 2017 the black arrows in fig 2 b quantify the lag of the groundwater fluctuation taking the arrow in the red box fig 2 b as an example the angle between the arrow and the right side is 180 clockwise indicating a lag of 1 2 period 180 360 the ordinate of the arrow indicates that the period is 16 days so a delay of 1 2 period thus means that the groundwater lags behind the river by eight days the warm colors contour in the figures indicate a high correlation between two time series and the cool colors indicate a low correlation the thick contour covers the region of the red noise standard spectrum test at the significance level α 0 05 the maximum time scale calculated by wtc is 256 days and the minimum time scale is one day according to the map there is no significant correlation between groundwater fluctuation and river flow in the high frequency period which means that the daily and weekly river fluctuations decay rapidly and have a limited impact on the groundwater near the observation well at the medium frequency period 16 day 40 day the river flow and groundwater fluctuation strongly correlate especially during the flood season july september the arrow pointing left in well b48 indicates the half cycle 8 day 20 day phase lag between the groundwater fluctuation and the river flow which is consistent with the results of yang et al 2021 nevertheless the outlying well b48 shows a downward arrow indicating that b48 only has a phase lag of around 0 25 cycles 5 day 10 day some unknown factors i e recharge water from the delingha uplift likely lead to b48 groundwater fluctuation periods in 2017 where groundwater fluctuation and river flow had a significant correlation are marked with bold lines in fig 2 e wtc analysis showed that in the second half of the year especially the wet season groundwater fluctuations were highly correlated with the bayin river the concentrated distribution of high correlation periods shows that the bayin river in the wet period dominates the flow field of the aquifer in the watershed finally the daily monitoring data of 14 wells within 55 days july 20 september 11 bounded by the two vertical red lines were selected as the inversion data set 4 2 aquifer based on the hydrogeological map provided by xi an geological survey center we establish a horizontal domain for numerical simulation fig 3 the water bearing group which mainly includes the alluvial proluvial plains in the north and some alluvial lacustrine plains in the south was selected to demonstrate the inversion model for its hydraulic connection between groundwater and rivers the inverse model contains 4 452 nodes and 4 189 elements the size of each element is 500 m 500 m according to the preliminary geological survey the aquifer was divided into three zones from north to south fig 4 the zone in the north is affected by urban construction and has a poor hydraulic connection with aquifers the middle zone comprises alluvial proluvial sediments and the zone in the south is mainly composed of alluvial lacustrine sediments the hydraulic conductivity coefficients of the zones from north to south are 20 m d 100 m d and 30 m d respectively likewise the specific storage coefficients are 0 08 m 1 0 08 m 1 and 0 05 m 1 respectively d values are 250 m2 d 1250 m2 d and 600 m2 d respectively since d distribution in each zone is not available we assume that d is uniform in each zone fig 4 bayin river basin is a typical sag basin surrounded by mountains or hills in the north west and east which isolate the hydraulic connection with the external hydrological units therefore the model assigned the zongwulong mountain delingha uplift and buht mountain as no flow boundaries although mountains do not block the northeast and northwest boundaries of the model domain we still consider the unblocked area as no flow boundaries since they are far from the bayin river and have limited influence on groundwater fluctuations in rst the river flow was treated as the variable head boundary driving groundwater fluctuations in the basin however the bayin river only monitors the flux at two gaging stations fig 3 the water level along the river i e the river stage data is absent and the river characteristics are unavailable therefore we developed a linear estimation approach to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of the river stage using the collected daily flow data at the two gaging stations of course a rigorous channel routing model would be most appropriate to represent the spatiotemporal river stage variation along the river however the scale of the problem examined here is enormous we believe that errors in the estimated river stages could be filtered out and have minor influences on the result of this study fig 5 shows the flow data measured by the upstream gaging station and downstream station as the solid and dashed lines respectively as shown the flux collected in the downstream gaging station is smaller than the flow in the upstream station since the observation data between the two stations is unavailable the temporal and spatial variations in the water supply and drainage of the bayin river are ambiguous statistically a stochastic process consisting of infinite possible distributions ensemble may be a credible generalization of the river flow fluctuations between two stations furthermore the actual flow distribution of the bayin river between two flow stations can be regarded as a realization of the ensemble yeh et al 2015 pointed out that the average behavior represents the most likely realization of the stochastic process in the statistical category although they are not necessarily unbiased as discussed we assume that bayin river flow decreases linearly from upstream to downstream based on this assumption we estimate the river stage of the bayin river as follows we discretize the simulation domain with 500 m 500 m elements the bayin river in the domain is characterized by 102 computing nodes fig 3 the solid and dashed lines in fig 5 represent the river flow between july 20 and september 12 at the first node and the last node of the bayin river respectively for example on september 12 the flow of the first node of bayin river was 43 1 m3 s the flow of the last node was 23 4 m3 s and the difference was 19 7 m3 s since we assume that the flow decreases linearly along the river implying that in the remaining 100 nodes of bayin river each node in turn reduces the flow by 0 197 m3 s following this approximation the river flow at 102 nodes of the bayin river on september 12 was calculated furthermore a 102 node 55 time matrix can be calculated to describe the spatiotemporal variation of the bayin river flow the 102 nodes divide the bayin river into 101 sections in each section the river flow should satisfy the open channel flow formula 11 q x y b h x y n b h x y b 2 h x y 2 3 i 1 2 where q x y represents the river flow h x y represents the river depth x represents the 55 days in the period fig 5 and y represents the 102 nodes in the model fig 3 b represents the river width 50 200 m n represents the manning coefficient and i represents the river gradient 0 01 0 005 assuming b n and i are constants q is then linearly proportional to h yang et al 2021 reported that the groundwater head in the bayin river fluctuates between 0 and 15 m therefore we can estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of water fluctuation from the bayin river flow it is worth noting that the upstream flow monitoring station is still a small distance from the study area about 1 5 of the river in the model therefore we estimate that the groundwater level fluctuation caused by the river in the model is only 0 12 m further h x y can be estimated by the normalized q x y with a new interval of 0 12 m at last adding the initial head 30 m to h x y yielded the variable head boundary h x y fig 5 c the calculated spatiotemporal distribution of q x y and h x y is shown in fig 5 b and c each line in the figure covers the period from july 20 to september 11 55 time nodes and the points of the line represent the values at different river nodes 102 nodes the abscissas in fig 5 b and c are the distance from the starting point of the bayin river both q and h decrease linearly with distance in fig 5 b the left and right endpoints of the line are the upstream and downstream monitoring flows in fig 5 a and the slope of the line is proportional to the difference between the two stations the length of the corresponding color line in fig 5 a further han et al 2020 pointed out that part of the river bed in the bayin river is concrete lined the dashed line in fig 3 and has no hydraulic connection with the aquifer therefore the infiltration is assumed to be zero in this section on the other hand the shallow rivers in the west and southeast of the model and gahai lake are considered fixed head boundaries the spatial distribution of d was subsequently estimated through re integrated stimulus response data with boundary conditions and prior information the correlation scales for the related materials are 10 km for the x direction and 7 5 km for the y direction about 1 3 of the model 4 3 application of the riverstage tomography fig 6 a b and c illustrate the rst estimated d field the uncertainty of estimated d the cross correlation between river flow and groundwater fluctuation and the standard calibration scatterplot with l2 normal respectively using fig 4 as the prior information the heterogeneous distribution of d in the study area was then obtained by rst the high d zone distribution in fig 6 a is similar to the distribution of the high correlation region in fig 6 c since sle algorithm use cross correlation between the groundwater fluctuation and hydraulic parameters during the inversion on the other hand the propagation of groundwater in the high d area is less hindered and disturbed and the signal characteristics are well conserved the signal received in the high d area is more likely to have a higher cross correlation fig 6 a illustrates that high d values distribute in the middle reaches of the bayin river and gradually decrease from east to west in general our knowledge of the deposition of alluvial fans should indicate a higher d value at the alluvial fan s apex somewhat contradicting our simulation results such a contradiction may reflect the urbanization in the upper part of the alluvial fan which led to the hardened river bed and the clogged porous medium ma and li 2006 these facts support the estimated d values of the rst fig 6 b shows the distribution of estimated uncertainty uncertainty decreases as the density of the well decreases that is to say we have more confidence in the estimated d in the middle of the alluvial fan overall the rst estimated d differs from the traditional geological survey fig 4 rst has a more detailed characterization of the d distribution 5 discussion a forward model was used to verify that the rst estimated d is consistent with the actual distribution of the bayin river basin specifically based on fig 6 a d estimated by rst and fig 4 d estimated by geological survey we used the 2019 river flow data to simulate the groundwater fluctuation in the basin with the river flow data from may 2018 to the end of 2019 fig 7 a as a stimulus and the 2018 groundwater data as the initial groundwater condition we then compared the results of these two cases to the observed groundwater variation fig 7 b shows the simulated groundwater fluctuations at wells d1 d5 d8 d11 d13 d15 d35 b48 and d79 based on the d estimated by the geological survey we observe that the simulated groundwater fluctuations are highly dependent on the river flow signal in frequency and highly inversely proportional to the distance between the monitoring well and the river in magnitude which has a significant deviation from the observed groundwater fluctuations fig 7 d in fact due to the inherent heterogeneity and unsaturated aquifer which is not considered in the model the impact of the river signal on the groundwater will be buffered with the high frequency signal filtered fig 7 c shows the simulated groundwater fluctuation under rst estimated d since the estimated d implies aquifer heterogeneity its prediction of the 2019 groundwater fluctuations is more in line with the observed value according to fig 7 a the wet season from the 160th day significantly increased river flow fig 7 e and f represent q and h of bayin river respectively in the dry season represented by t 10 the slopes and initial values of q and h are minimal and in the wet season represented by t 172 and t 190 q and h vary significantly the groundwater fluctuation of d8 d14 d5 d1 and d11 in fig 7 c is highly sensitive to river flow these wells are within the high d zone in fig 6 a indicating that a high d value leads to good hydraulic connectivity on the other hand the groundwater fluctuations in low d areas such as d35 and d79 are almost inverted to the river fluctuations after the 210th day the bayin river flow decreases gradually attenuating the observed and simulated groundwater fluctuations however after 240th days the simulated heads deviated from the observed heads this deviation is likely because the river flow in august 2019 was significantly smaller than in 2018 with less weighting of river flow fluctuations to groundwater fluctuations furthermore forward modeling based on rst estimated parameters cannot solve groundwater fluctuations caused by rainfall evaporation irrigation etc therefore the error of forward modeling is significant when the bayin river does not dominate the groundwater fluctuations in the first 160 days both the simulated and observed values reflect the decline in groundwater fluctuation the rate of the decline and groundwater level simulated with the estimates from rst are close to the observed the above discussion shows that the inversion results are more sensitive to groundwater fluctuations than the prior information based on geologic zones we plot the observed vs simulated head between the 164th and 214th of the flood season from the ten wells fig 8 two different labels the hollow box and the solid circle represent the groundwater fluctuation calculated by the rst estimated d fig 6 a and the prior parameters fig 4 respectively most of these plots reveal that groundwater fluctuation calculated by the rts estimated d captures the general trends of the observed heads at wells in particular the monitoring wells d8 d14 d5 d1 and d11 with high correlation coefficients r2 and slope of the regression line dashed line close to 1 the groundwater fluctuation calculated by geological survey estimated d shows large deviations and bias these plots further reveal that the rts estimated d led to a more detailed characterization of the aquifer than the geological d nonetheless we also found that the plots at some monitoring wells have high r2 values but slope values deviating significantly from 1 such as d5 d13 b48 indicative of bias the outlines a few squares in the plot of monitoring well d5 may be due to unknown factors omitted in the simulation likewise some plots have very low r2 corresponding to monitoring wells located southeast of the study area where d is low the low d means that the bayin river has a limited influence on these monitoring wells thus estimating the d values using the groundwater fluctuations induced by river flow fluctuations is difficult it is worth mentioning that the significant bias could result from many factors first the leakage from the river to the aquifer was unknown compelling the estimation of d only using time varying head boundary at the river nodes another possibility is the errors introduced from the interpolated flow at river reaches where flow observations were unavailable further due to the absence of unsaturated parameters the influence of unsaturated flow processes such as the nonlinear dependence of permeability coefficient on water content pressure head is not considered in the inversion process there is also a hysteresis in the response of the groundwater to the river flow due to repeated imbibition and drainage of the pore media lastly the number of observed wells is limited and other unknown factors remain to be explored however this bias problem may be resolved if the river stages at many river locations were measured and more monitoring groundwater wells were available in addition using 3 d variably saturated governing equations yeh et al 2015 as the forward equation can better estimate the distribution of d in the bayin river basin even though it will significantly increase the difficulty of rst inversion further new data processing and analysis strategies could minimize the uncertainty of initial conditions luo et al 2022 using migrating flood waves in a stream as a new stimulus source wang et al 2021 would improve the resolution of the estimates mapping anomalous zones from large scale ht surveys may identify the hydraulic boundaries liu and kitanidis 2011 lastly fusing additional hydrologic information such as rainfall and irrigation hao et al 2008 zha et al 2017 can further improve our estimate of the d distribution since rainfall irrigation evaporation and unsaturated infiltration processes are ignored in the inversion process the estimated parameters are only related to the river stage errors between the estimated and actual values exist nevertheless the rst still captures the heterogeneous characteristics of the bayin river basin which are consistent with the geological situation for example the application of the rst reveals that urbanization has decreased the hydraulic connection between rivers and underground in the northern region reflected by a lower d value further the high d zone is relatively near buht mountain while the delingha uplift and the tail of the alluvial fan have lower d values this distribution agrees with the general principle of alluvial fan deposition that is the particle size of the sediment progressively becomes fine from upstream to downstream zhao et al 2014 specifically in historical times the bayin river ran from northeast to southwest in the study area transporting sand pebble and gravel the physics intuition tells us that pebbles and gravels are mainly deposited in the river s upper reaches namely black rock mountain and its north smaller gravels require less energy and are carried downstream fine textured sands are deposited further downstream forming regions of relatively low d regions finally the contributions of this study are followings first few studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using river and groundwater fluctuations to map basin scale heterogeneity under a real world scenario in particular we demonstrate that the rst with sle algorithm and stochastic modeling groundwater hydrology is a viable approach to delineating hydraulic properties over a basin scale aquifer a practical and valuable approach secondly although the river flows at different parts of the river were unavailable our simple linear interpretation of the river stage could help characterize the groundwater basin pragmatically after all while the study is an application it underscores applications of the newly developed theories to a real world scenario to explore unresolved issues for a newly developed theory 6 conclusion based on the river data collected by the river flow monitoring station this paper infers that the river flow and the groundwater strongly correlate in the flood season through wavelet analysis furthermore based on the stimulus response dataset of river flow and groundwater fluctuation from july to september 2017 rst estimated the heterogeneous distribution of d in the bayin river basin this study shows that the areas with high d values are distributed near buht mountain and the areas with low d values are located in the delingha uplift and the tail of the alluvial fan this result is consistent with the sedimentation principle of the bayin river basin we conclude that human activities and urbanization cause the absence of high d values in the apex we found that the cross correlation analysis of the groundwater fluctuation and the river flow over the years reveals the high correlation zone and the high d zone this finding affirms the feasibility of using sle for river stage tomography since it is based on cross correlation xiang et al 2009 numerous assumptions were made in this study and the effects of rainfall irrigation and unsaturated infiltration on the groundwater were ignored nevertheless when the rst estimated d and the geological survey estimated d were verified using the dataset in 2019 it was found that the rst estimated d could better characterize the groundwater fluctuation during the flood season in 2019 this finding reveals that capturing groundwater responses at various parts of a basin caused by some disturbances could reveal hydraulic connectivity which is not evident in the prior geologic information this finding is essential to advance our aquifer characterization technologies for small or large scale geological media it further affirms the contribution of rst in characterizing aquifers heterogeneity and promotes the view toward the future subsurface sciences advocated by yeh et al 2008 although the simulation results capture the general heterogeneous distribution of hydraulic parameters in the bayin river basin and reflect groundwater fluctuation in the flood season rst still needs improvements in identifying large scale heterogeneity of hydrological parameters i e reducing the uncertainty of prior parameters optimizing stimulus sources and fusing extra monitoring data these improvements should enhance the accuracy and ability of rst for basin scale aquifer characterization luo et al 2022 wang et al 2021 liu and kitanidis 2011 hao et al 2008 zha et al 2017 credit authorship contribution statement rifeng xia

1886,the drastic spatial and temporal variations of water resources are one of the causes of the fragile ecological environment in the bayin river basin while the temporal variation is less predictable a detailed spatial distribution of hydrological parameters of the basin is invaluable for developing guidance for allocating and utilizing water resources in the bayin river basin this study estimates the two dimensional spatial distribution of hydraulic diffusivity d of the bayin river basin through the relationship between river flow and groundwater using limited available river stages data along the river it first conducted a wavelet analysis to illustrate strong correlations between river flow and groundwater during the flood season in the basin subsequently it used a simple linear model to estimate temporal and spatial variations of the river stage along the river due to flood then the study applied a recently developed river stage tomography rst to the alluvial fan to estimate the spatial distribution of the d values the rst treats the flood river stage as a signal pressure transmitter and the groundwater fluctuation recorded in the observation wells as the images of the aquifer heterogeneity between the river and observation wells the rst then synthesizes these images to characterize the heterogeneous distribution of d in the alluvial fan in the bayin river basin the results show that the northeast area of the alluvial fan has a relatively high d while the d is relatively low in the tail and the southwest area of the fan these findings are consistent with the general concept of alluvial fan evolution moreover the predicted groundwater levels during the flood event in 2019 based on the rst estimated d is more accurate than the preliminary stratigraphic survey confirming that capturing groundwater responses at various parts of a basin caused by some disturbances could reveal hydraulic connectivity which the prior geologic information cannot this result is essential to advancing aquifer characterization technologies and affirming the contribution of rst and the view toward the future subsurface sciences advocated by yeh et al 2008 keywords river stage tomography hydraulic diffusivity aquifer characterize wavelet analysis data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the bayin river originates from the lianshan water system in the northern part of the qaidam basin in china yang et al 2021 bayin river basin is fragile in the eco environment and has unevenly distributed water resources in time and space hang et al 2019 the river flood has frequently been a hazard for surrounding residents while recharging the groundwater this situation mandates effectively managing water resources and preventing flood disasters which demand comprehensive hydrogeological surveys in the bayin river basin traditional hydrological tests to characterize aquifers such as pumping tests assume that the aquifers tested are homogeneous this assumption is inconsistent with the actual situation where aquifers are heterogeneous at various scales james et al 1993 moreover the test uses groundwater responses at one well i e a point in a heterogeneous aquifer to infer the property of the entire aquifer wu et al 2005 claimed that the tests compare apples and oranges yielding biased and unrealistic aquifer properties to solve these problems yeh and liu 2000 developed a geostatistical based hydraulic tomography ht which can yield the heterogeneous distribution of hydraulic conductivity and specific storage values and their uncertainty cost effectively in effect ht evolves from our common sense examining an object from different perspectives like the medical cat scan and geophysical imaging technologies ht injects or extracts water from aquifers at one well to create excitation and uses monitoring wells to capture the excitation as they travel through aquifer heterogeneity between the pumping and monitoring wells repeating this operation at different pumping and monitoring wells ht collects the aquifer heterogeneity information from different perspectives many e g bohling et al 2007 cardiff et al 2013 fienen et al 2008 liu and kitanidis 2011 brauchler et al 2003 yeh and liu 2000 luo et al 2022 had developed ht interpretation methods the successive linear estimator sle algorithm xiang 2007 yeh et al 1995 yeh et al 1996 yeh et al 2002 zhu and yeh 2005 has been widely and successfully applied to many numerical laboratory and field experiments sle is an iterative geostatistical estimation method evolving from kriging and cokriging estimator unlike these linear estimators sle successively updates the estimate and its covariance function to include the nonlinear relationship between hydraulic characteristics and observation information since the last century many have applied the hydraulic tomography theory to characterize the hydraulic conductivity field and storativity field of heterogeneous aquifers examples include numerical simulation studies sun et al 2013 xiang et al 2009 zha et al 2018 zhu and yeh 2005 laboratory sandboxes and fractured rocks experiments illman et al 2012 2007 2010 jiang et al 2020 and field studies berg and illman 2011 bohling et al 2007 cardiff et al 2013 huang et al 2011 illman et al 2009 wen et al 2019 zha et al 2017 zhao and illman 2018 all these studies confirmed that ht with sle can effectively characterize the spatial distribution of hydraulic parameters in aquifers more recently daranond et al 2020 and liu et al 2020 demonstrated that ht can detect groundwater basin shape and boundary conditions in numerical and field examples kuhlman et al 2008 demonstrated the feasibility of conducting a series of ht tests in a basin scale aquifer using a numerical experiment exploiting pump and treat remediation systems as an ht zha et al 2019 characterized a basin scale aquifer in tucson arizona liu et al 2020 took advantage of regional reduction of groundwater withdrawal programs to identify the heterogeneity and boundary conditions in a basin in china using artificial stimuli to create basin scale ht excitations is difficult yeh et al 2008 proposed using recurrent natural events precipitation flood earthquake and lightning for basin scale tomographic surveys to characterize groundwater basins subsequently yeh et al 2009 developed the rst exploring the migration of flood waves as a stimulus for ht and demonstrated its feasibility wang et al 2017 applied the rst to an alluvial fan in taiwan using numerical experiments wang et al 2021 showed that a migrating single flood wave is more effective than the periodic river stage fluctuations for characterizing the aquifer heterogeneity the concept of rst is relatively new and its applications to real world scenarios are limited more applications validating and promoting this new technology are relevant to improve new technologies and better managing our precious water resources for this reason this article applied the rst to the bayin river basin in china to further test this new technology first we use wavelet analysis to analyze the time series of the bayin river flow and groundwater the river flows and groundwater levels during periods with high cross correlation between them were selected as the inversion dataset in addition the cross correlation analysis between the groundwater head and the river flow was used to make a preliminary inference on the hydraulic diffusivity d field afterward we constructed a large scale groundwater flow model for rst to estimate the d field and tested the estimates by predicting the groundwater flow field during different flood events 2 site description the china geological survey conducted a massive field reconnaissance in bayin river basin for groundwater head monitoring twenty four observation wells of different depths were implemented in the basin fig 1 these monitoring wells are mainly in the middle reaches of the bayin river basin and the rest are scattered around delingha uplift and gahai lake the depths of these monitoring wells are about 10 m 180 m depending on the groundwater depth since the installation of these monitoring wells in 2016 groundwater head and temperature data in the wells have been collected hourly among these monitoring wells we selected 14 wells with minimal disturbance for this study marked with a yellow background in fig 1 the two inverted red triangles represent the river flow monitoring stations that collect daily bayin river flow data besides remote sensing surveys pumping tests borehole sampling and other work provide references for this research therefore the bayin river basin has sufficient information for the river stage tomography 2 1 topography the altitude of the terrain from north to south is from 2808 to 5030 m mountains to the north hills to the south and the delingha uplift in the middle divide the alluvial plain into two parts han et al 2020 the water stored in the north of the basin is ampler than that in the south the terrain of the basin controls the meander of the groundwater movement the bayin river recharges groundwater along the way and eventually flows into crook lake through the river and underground flow 2 2 geology the xi an geological survey center of china geological survey conducted a detailed investigation of the hydrogeology of the bayin river basin in the past years cheng et al 2019 wen et al 2018 han et al 2020 yang et al 2021 the geological survey reveals that the bayin river basin piedmont plain comprises an alluvial proluvial plain and an alluvial lacustrine plain the groundwater is distributed horizontally along the morphological facies zones which is consistent with the distribution characteristics of groundwater in the arid inland basin alluvial fan yang et al 2021 the alluvial proluvial plain dominated by phreatic aquifers is a crucial groundwater reservoir in the bayin river basin the phreatic aquifers originated north and developed to the south in a fan shaped distribution with 80 m in depth the stratum is loose with large pores high hydraulic conductivity high water abundance and high hydraulic connection the distribution of sediments follows sand gravel argillaceous sand gravel and sandy mudstone from the apex to the tail of the alluvial proluvial plains the alluvial lacustrine plain distributed south of the alluvial proluvial plain with banded distribution comprises confined aquifers with a depth of 20 180 m owing to sedimentary conditions at the junction with the alluvial fan the upper aquifer is sand gravel and the lower part is a silty fine sand layer geological processes such as uplift denudation and sedimentation thin out the aquifer at the tail of the alluvial lacustrine plain 3 theory and method theoretically the rst requires a relationship between the river and groundwater head however the noise such as human activities e g irrigation drainage etc and natural influences e g rainfall evaporation etc could corrupt data misleading our estimation of the distribution of d diffusivity in aquifers as such we used the wavelet coherence wtc analysis to select the period with a high correlation between the river flow and the groundwater field to eliminate the data noise caused by unwanted factors baddoo et al 2015 grinsted et al 2004 yin et al 2011 the wtc code is provided by grinsted et al 2004 for wavelet analysis a morlet wavelet is defined as the mother wavelet 1 ψ 0 n π 1 4 e i ω 0 η e 1 2 η 2 where ω0 is dimensionless frequency and η is dimensionless time generally the morlet wavelet with ω0 6 has a good balance between the time and the frequency localization and can effectively carry out continuous wavelet transform cwt grinsted et al 2004 also presented a wavelet coherent calculation fourier squared coherency analysis that identifies the frequency bands within which time series are co varying baddoo et al 2015 specifically wtc finds the period where the time series correlate well in the time frequency space yu et al 2007 yao et al 2018 following the wtc analysis a stochastic parameter estimator i e successive linear estimator sle utilizes the river stage groundwater data and governing groundwater flow equation to estimate the spatial distribution of hydraulic properties over the groundwater basin sle is an inversion algorithm based on a geostatistical concept available at https tian hwr arizona edu downloads or contact stochasticfusion gmail com sle decomposes a nonlinear estimation problem into a linear one and iteratively utilizes the linear spatial autocorrelation between parameters and the cross correlation between parameters and observations with updated autocorrelation and cross correlation yeh et al 1996 provided a detailed discussion of sle the following is a brief presentation of the sle the governing equation of groundwater flow in saturated porous media is 2 k h s s h t subject to boundary and initial conditions 3 h γ h 1 and h t 0 h 0 where k is hydraulic conductivity ss is specific storage h is the total head h1 is the prescribed total head at head boundary γ and h0 represents the initial total head eq 2 can also be written as the groundwater diffusion equation 4 d h h t where d is hydraulic diffusivity in this study the spatial distribution of d will be characterized by the variation of h in response to the riverstage change the calculation formula for the estimated d of spatial variation is 5 u c r 1 u c r ω r t d d r where u c r is an n 1 vector representing perturbations of lnd to be estimated at n locations the superscript r is the iteration index when r 0 the value of u c 0 represents the guessed prior or initial lnd field based on geological exploration information d is a m 1vector representing m observed heads at observation wells d r represents the simulated heads at the observation wells based on the lnd estimated from the previous iteration the estimated u is adjusted by the difference between d and d r in each iteration step and the weight coefficient matrix ω is determined by solving the following equation 6 ε dd λ diag ε dd ω ε du where ε dd and ε du are the covariance matrix of d and the covariance matrix between d and u respectively λ is the dynamic multiplier of the levenberg marquardt algorithm and diag operator represents the diagonal matrix the covariance and cross covariance are obtained by first order analysis using the sensitivity calculated by the adjoint equation 7 ε dd r j du r ε u u r j du r t 8 ε du r j du r ε uu r where j du r is the sensitivity matrix of the d to the changes of u the parameter covariance matrix ε uu r is given by the prior geological information when r 0 and is gradually updated in each iteration according to the following formula to derive the residual covariance 9 ε uu r 1 ε uu r ω r t ε du r the mean square error l2 is used to estimate the error between the observed and simulated values 10 l 2 1 m i 1 m d i d i r 2 4 result and analysis 4 1 wavelet analysis the time series and wavelet amplitude spectrograms between the river flow and the groundwater fluctuation at all available observation wells from may 2017 to december 2018 were analyzed in particular wells d11 and b48 were selected to investigate the relationship between groundwater fluctuation and river flow d11 is on a wasteland 3 5 km from the bayin river far away from cities and agricultural areas with minimal disturbance from human activities well b48 is 13 0 km from the bayin river and close to the delingha uplift with scattered farmland and villages the time series and the wtc map of the groundwater fluctuation and the river flow are illustrated in fig 2 a and 2 b respectively groundwater fluctuation at d11 increases monotonically with minor perturbations with a lag behind the changes in the river flow the groundwater variation is smoother than the river flow variation because the geological media between the river and the groundwater filters the high frequency signal of the river fluctuation wang et al 2017 the black arrows in fig 2 b quantify the lag of the groundwater fluctuation taking the arrow in the red box fig 2 b as an example the angle between the arrow and the right side is 180 clockwise indicating a lag of 1 2 period 180 360 the ordinate of the arrow indicates that the period is 16 days so a delay of 1 2 period thus means that the groundwater lags behind the river by eight days the warm colors contour in the figures indicate a high correlation between two time series and the cool colors indicate a low correlation the thick contour covers the region of the red noise standard spectrum test at the significance level α 0 05 the maximum time scale calculated by wtc is 256 days and the minimum time scale is one day according to the map there is no significant correlation between groundwater fluctuation and river flow in the high frequency period which means that the daily and weekly river fluctuations decay rapidly and have a limited impact on the groundwater near the observation well at the medium frequency period 16 day 40 day the river flow and groundwater fluctuation strongly correlate especially during the flood season july september the arrow pointing left in well b48 indicates the half cycle 8 day 20 day phase lag between the groundwater fluctuation and the river flow which is consistent with the results of yang et al 2021 nevertheless the outlying well b48 shows a downward arrow indicating that b48 only has a phase lag of around 0 25 cycles 5 day 10 day some unknown factors i e recharge water from the delingha uplift likely lead to b48 groundwater fluctuation periods in 2017 where groundwater fluctuation and river flow had a significant correlation are marked with bold lines in fig 2 e wtc analysis showed that in the second half of the year especially the wet season groundwater fluctuations were highly correlated with the bayin river the concentrated distribution of high correlation periods shows that the bayin river in the wet period dominates the flow field of the aquifer in the watershed finally the daily monitoring data of 14 wells within 55 days july 20 september 11 bounded by the two vertical red lines were selected as the inversion data set 4 2 aquifer based on the hydrogeological map provided by xi an geological survey center we establish a horizontal domain for numerical simulation fig 3 the water bearing group which mainly includes the alluvial proluvial plains in the north and some alluvial lacustrine plains in the south was selected to demonstrate the inversion model for its hydraulic connection between groundwater and rivers the inverse model contains 4 452 nodes and 4 189 elements the size of each element is 500 m 500 m according to the preliminary geological survey the aquifer was divided into three zones from north to south fig 4 the zone in the north is affected by urban construction and has a poor hydraulic connection with aquifers the middle zone comprises alluvial proluvial sediments and the zone in the south is mainly composed of alluvial lacustrine sediments the hydraulic conductivity coefficients of the zones from north to south are 20 m d 100 m d and 30 m d respectively likewise the specific storage coefficients are 0 08 m 1 0 08 m 1 and 0 05 m 1 respectively d values are 250 m2 d 1250 m2 d and 600 m2 d respectively since d distribution in each zone is not available we assume that d is uniform in each zone fig 4 bayin river basin is a typical sag basin surrounded by mountains or hills in the north west and east which isolate the hydraulic connection with the external hydrological units therefore the model assigned the zongwulong mountain delingha uplift and buht mountain as no flow boundaries although mountains do not block the northeast and northwest boundaries of the model domain we still consider the unblocked area as no flow boundaries since they are far from the bayin river and have limited influence on groundwater fluctuations in rst the river flow was treated as the variable head boundary driving groundwater fluctuations in the basin however the bayin river only monitors the flux at two gaging stations fig 3 the water level along the river i e the river stage data is absent and the river characteristics are unavailable therefore we developed a linear estimation approach to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of the river stage using the collected daily flow data at the two gaging stations of course a rigorous channel routing model would be most appropriate to represent the spatiotemporal river stage variation along the river however the scale of the problem examined here is enormous we believe that errors in the estimated river stages could be filtered out and have minor influences on the result of this study fig 5 shows the flow data measured by the upstream gaging station and downstream station as the solid and dashed lines respectively as shown the flux collected in the downstream gaging station is smaller than the flow in the upstream station since the observation data between the two stations is unavailable the temporal and spatial variations in the water supply and drainage of the bayin river are ambiguous statistically a stochastic process consisting of infinite possible distributions ensemble may be a credible generalization of the river flow fluctuations between two stations furthermore the actual flow distribution of the bayin river between two flow stations can be regarded as a realization of the ensemble yeh et al 2015 pointed out that the average behavior represents the most likely realization of the stochastic process in the statistical category although they are not necessarily unbiased as discussed we assume that bayin river flow decreases linearly from upstream to downstream based on this assumption we estimate the river stage of the bayin river as follows we discretize the simulation domain with 500 m 500 m elements the bayin river in the domain is characterized by 102 computing nodes fig 3 the solid and dashed lines in fig 5 represent the river flow between july 20 and september 12 at the first node and the last node of the bayin river respectively for example on september 12 the flow of the first node of bayin river was 43 1 m3 s the flow of the last node was 23 4 m3 s and the difference was 19 7 m3 s since we assume that the flow decreases linearly along the river implying that in the remaining 100 nodes of bayin river each node in turn reduces the flow by 0 197 m3 s following this approximation the river flow at 102 nodes of the bayin river on september 12 was calculated furthermore a 102 node 55 time matrix can be calculated to describe the spatiotemporal variation of the bayin river flow the 102 nodes divide the bayin river into 101 sections in each section the river flow should satisfy the open channel flow formula 11 q x y b h x y n b h x y b 2 h x y 2 3 i 1 2 where q x y represents the river flow h x y represents the river depth x represents the 55 days in the period fig 5 and y represents the 102 nodes in the model fig 3 b represents the river width 50 200 m n represents the manning coefficient and i represents the river gradient 0 01 0 005 assuming b n and i are constants q is then linearly proportional to h yang et al 2021 reported that the groundwater head in the bayin river fluctuates between 0 and 15 m therefore we can estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of water fluctuation from the bayin river flow it is worth noting that the upstream flow monitoring station is still a small distance from the study area about 1 5 of the river in the model therefore we estimate that the groundwater level fluctuation caused by the river in the model is only 0 12 m further h x y can be estimated by the normalized q x y with a new interval of 0 12 m at last adding the initial head 30 m to h x y yielded the variable head boundary h x y fig 5 c the calculated spatiotemporal distribution of q x y and h x y is shown in fig 5 b and c each line in the figure covers the period from july 20 to september 11 55 time nodes and the points of the line represent the values at different river nodes 102 nodes the abscissas in fig 5 b and c are the distance from the starting point of the bayin river both q and h decrease linearly with distance in fig 5 b the left and right endpoints of the line are the upstream and downstream monitoring flows in fig 5 a and the slope of the line is proportional to the difference between the two stations the length of the corresponding color line in fig 5 a further han et al 2020 pointed out that part of the river bed in the bayin river is concrete lined the dashed line in fig 3 and has no hydraulic connection with the aquifer therefore the infiltration is assumed to be zero in this section on the other hand the shallow rivers in the west and southeast of the model and gahai lake are considered fixed head boundaries the spatial distribution of d was subsequently estimated through re integrated stimulus response data with boundary conditions and prior information the correlation scales for the related materials are 10 km for the x direction and 7 5 km for the y direction about 1 3 of the model 4 3 application of the riverstage tomography fig 6 a b and c illustrate the rst estimated d field the uncertainty of estimated d the cross correlation between river flow and groundwater fluctuation and the standard calibration scatterplot with l2 normal respectively using fig 4 as the prior information the heterogeneous distribution of d in the study area was then obtained by rst the high d zone distribution in fig 6 a is similar to the distribution of the high correlation region in fig 6 c since sle algorithm use cross correlation between the groundwater fluctuation and hydraulic parameters during the inversion on the other hand the propagation of groundwater in the high d area is less hindered and disturbed and the signal characteristics are well conserved the signal received in the high d area is more likely to have a higher cross correlation fig 6 a illustrates that high d values distribute in the middle reaches of the bayin river and gradually decrease from east to west in general our knowledge of the deposition of alluvial fans should indicate a higher d value at the alluvial fan s apex somewhat contradicting our simulation results such a contradiction may reflect the urbanization in the upper part of the alluvial fan which led to the hardened river bed and the clogged porous medium ma and li 2006 these facts support the estimated d values of the rst fig 6 b shows the distribution of estimated uncertainty uncertainty decreases as the density of the well decreases that is to say we have more confidence in the estimated d in the middle of the alluvial fan overall the rst estimated d differs from the traditional geological survey fig 4 rst has a more detailed characterization of the d distribution 5 discussion a forward model was used to verify that the rst estimated d is consistent with the actual distribution of the bayin river basin specifically based on fig 6 a d estimated by rst and fig 4 d estimated by geological survey we used the 2019 river flow data to simulate the groundwater fluctuation in the basin with the river flow data from may 2018 to the end of 2019 fig 7 a as a stimulus and the 2018 groundwater data as the initial groundwater condition we then compared the results of these two cases to the observed groundwater variation fig 7 b shows the simulated groundwater fluctuations at wells d1 d5 d8 d11 d13 d15 d35 b48 and d79 based on the d estimated by the geological survey we observe that the simulated groundwater fluctuations are highly dependent on the river flow signal in frequency and highly inversely proportional to the distance between the monitoring well and the river in magnitude which has a significant deviation from the observed groundwater fluctuations fig 7 d in fact due to the inherent heterogeneity and unsaturated aquifer which is not considered in the model the impact of the river signal on the groundwater will be buffered with the high frequency signal filtered fig 7 c shows the simulated groundwater fluctuation under rst estimated d since the estimated d implies aquifer heterogeneity its prediction of the 2019 groundwater fluctuations is more in line with the observed value according to fig 7 a the wet season from the 160th day significantly increased river flow fig 7 e and f represent q and h of bayin river respectively in the dry season represented by t 10 the slopes and initial values of q and h are minimal and in the wet season represented by t 172 and t 190 q and h vary significantly the groundwater fluctuation of d8 d14 d5 d1 and d11 in fig 7 c is highly sensitive to river flow these wells are within the high d zone in fig 6 a indicating that a high d value leads to good hydraulic connectivity on the other hand the groundwater fluctuations in low d areas such as d35 and d79 are almost inverted to the river fluctuations after the 210th day the bayin river flow decreases gradually attenuating the observed and simulated groundwater fluctuations however after 240th days the simulated heads deviated from the observed heads this deviation is likely because the river flow in august 2019 was significantly smaller than in 2018 with less weighting of river flow fluctuations to groundwater fluctuations furthermore forward modeling based on rst estimated parameters cannot solve groundwater fluctuations caused by rainfall evaporation irrigation etc therefore the error of forward modeling is significant when the bayin river does not dominate the groundwater fluctuations in the first 160 days both the simulated and observed values reflect the decline in groundwater fluctuation the rate of the decline and groundwater level simulated with the estimates from rst are close to the observed the above discussion shows that the inversion results are more sensitive to groundwater fluctuations than the prior information based on geologic zones we plot the observed vs simulated head between the 164th and 214th of the flood season from the ten wells fig 8 two different labels the hollow box and the solid circle represent the groundwater fluctuation calculated by the rst estimated d fig 6 a and the prior parameters fig 4 respectively most of these plots reveal that groundwater fluctuation calculated by the rts estimated d captures the general trends of the observed heads at wells in particular the monitoring wells d8 d14 d5 d1 and d11 with high correlation coefficients r2 and slope of the regression line dashed line close to 1 the groundwater fluctuation calculated by geological survey estimated d shows large deviations and bias these plots further reveal that the rts estimated d led to a more detailed characterization of the aquifer than the geological d nonetheless we also found that the plots at some monitoring wells have high r2 values but slope values deviating significantly from 1 such as d5 d13 b48 indicative of bias the outlines a few squares in the plot of monitoring well d5 may be due to unknown factors omitted in the simulation likewise some plots have very low r2 corresponding to monitoring wells located southeast of the study area where d is low the low d means that the bayin river has a limited influence on these monitoring wells thus estimating the d values using the groundwater fluctuations induced by river flow fluctuations is difficult it is worth mentioning that the significant bias could result from many factors first the leakage from the river to the aquifer was unknown compelling the estimation of d only using time varying head boundary at the river nodes another possibility is the errors introduced from the interpolated flow at river reaches where flow observations were unavailable further due to the absence of unsaturated parameters the influence of unsaturated flow processes such as the nonlinear dependence of permeability coefficient on water content pressure head is not considered in the inversion process there is also a hysteresis in the response of the groundwater to the river flow due to repeated imbibition and drainage of the pore media lastly the number of observed wells is limited and other unknown factors remain to be explored however this bias problem may be resolved if the river stages at many river locations were measured and more monitoring groundwater wells were available in addition using 3 d variably saturated governing equations yeh et al 2015 as the forward equation can better estimate the distribution of d in the bayin river basin even though it will significantly increase the difficulty of rst inversion further new data processing and analysis strategies could minimize the uncertainty of initial conditions luo et al 2022 using migrating flood waves in a stream as a new stimulus source wang et al 2021 would improve the resolution of the estimates mapping anomalous zones from large scale ht surveys may identify the hydraulic boundaries liu and kitanidis 2011 lastly fusing additional hydrologic information such as rainfall and irrigation hao et al 2008 zha et al 2017 can further improve our estimate of the d distribution since rainfall irrigation evaporation and unsaturated infiltration processes are ignored in the inversion process the estimated parameters are only related to the river stage errors between the estimated and actual values exist nevertheless the rst still captures the heterogeneous characteristics of the bayin river basin which are consistent with the geological situation for example the application of the rst reveals that urbanization has decreased the hydraulic connection between rivers and underground in the northern region reflected by a lower d value further the high d zone is relatively near buht mountain while the delingha uplift and the tail of the alluvial fan have lower d values this distribution agrees with the general principle of alluvial fan deposition that is the particle size of the sediment progressively becomes fine from upstream to downstream zhao et al 2014 specifically in historical times the bayin river ran from northeast to southwest in the study area transporting sand pebble and gravel the physics intuition tells us that pebbles and gravels are mainly deposited in the river s upper reaches namely black rock mountain and its north smaller gravels require less energy and are carried downstream fine textured sands are deposited further downstream forming regions of relatively low d regions finally the contributions of this study are followings first few studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using river and groundwater fluctuations to map basin scale heterogeneity under a real world scenario in particular we demonstrate that the rst with sle algorithm and stochastic modeling groundwater hydrology is a viable approach to delineating hydraulic properties over a basin scale aquifer a practical and valuable approach secondly although the river flows at different parts of the river were unavailable our simple linear interpretation of the river stage could help characterize the groundwater basin pragmatically after all while the study is an application it underscores applications of the newly developed theories to a real world scenario to explore unresolved issues for a newly developed theory 6 conclusion based on the river data collected by the river flow monitoring station this paper infers that the river flow and the groundwater strongly correlate in the flood season through wavelet analysis furthermore based on the stimulus response dataset of river flow and groundwater fluctuation from july to september 2017 rst estimated the heterogeneous distribution of d in the bayin river basin this study shows that the areas with high d values are distributed near buht mountain and the areas with low d values are located in the delingha uplift and the tail of the alluvial fan this result is consistent with the sedimentation principle of the bayin river basin we conclude that human activities and urbanization cause the absence of high d values in the apex we found that the cross correlation analysis of the groundwater fluctuation and the river flow over the years reveals the high correlation zone and the high d zone this finding affirms the feasibility of using sle for river stage tomography since it is based on cross correlation xiang et al 2009 numerous assumptions were made in this study and the effects of rainfall irrigation and unsaturated infiltration on the groundwater were ignored nevertheless when the rst estimated d and the geological survey estimated d were verified using the dataset in 2019 it was found that the rst estimated d could better characterize the groundwater fluctuation during the flood season in 2019 this finding reveals that capturing groundwater responses at various parts of a basin caused by some disturbances could reveal hydraulic connectivity which is not evident in the prior geologic information this finding is essential to advance our aquifer characterization technologies for small or large scale geological media it further affirms the contribution of rst in characterizing aquifers heterogeneity and promotes the view toward the future subsurface sciences advocated by yeh et al 2008 although the simulation results capture the general heterogeneous distribution of hydraulic parameters in the bayin river basin and reflect groundwater fluctuation in the flood season rst still needs improvements in identifying large scale heterogeneity of hydrological parameters i e reducing the uncertainty of prior parameters optimizing stimulus sources and fusing extra monitoring data these improvements should enhance the accuracy and ability of rst for basin scale aquifer characterization luo et al 2022 wang et al 2021 liu and kitanidis 2011 hao et al 2008 zha et al 2017 credit authorship contribution statement rifeng xia

their impact on humans and the wider environment karst aquifers are globally widespread providing critical water supplies and sustaining rivers and ecosystems and are particularly susceptible to pollution however eoc distributions in karst remain quite poorly understood this study looks at the occurrence of eocs in the croatian karst which is an example of the classical karst a highly developed type of karst that occurs throughout the dinaric region of europe samples were collected from 17 karst springs and one karst lake used for water supply in croatia during two sampling campaigns from a screen of 740 compounds a total of 65 compounds were detected eoc compounds from the pharmaceutical n 26 and agrochemical groups n 26 were the most frequently detected while industrials and artificial sweeteners had the highest concentrations range 8 440 ng l the number of detected compounds and the frequency of detection demonstrate the vulnerability of karst to eoc pollution concentrations of 5 compounds acesulfame sucralose perfluorobutane sulfonate emamectin b1b and triphenyl phosphate exceeded eu standards and occurred at concentrations that are likely to be harmful to ecosystems overall most detections were at low concentrations 50 1 ng l this may be due to high dilution within the exceptionally large springs of the classical karst or due to relatively few pollution sources within the catchments nevertheless eoc fluxes are considerable 10 to 106 ng s due to the high discharge of the springs temporal differences were observed but without a clear pattern reflecting the highly variable nature of karst springs that occurs over both seasonal and short term timescales this research is one of a handful of regional eoc investigations in karst groundwater and the first regional study in the dinaric karst it demonstrates the need for more frequent and extensive sampling of eocs in karst to protect human health and the environment keywords emerging organic contaminants karst aquifers dinaric karst groundwater drinking water resources data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction emerging organic contaminants eocs are anthropogenic micropollutants that are typically difficult to identify in aquatic environments due to their low concentrations in the last decade technological advances have made detection of a wide range of eocs in water possible with increasing numbers of studies muter and bartkevics 2020 richardson and kimura 2020 schmidt 2018 growing evidence for their presence in surface and groundwater systems has raised lots of new questions about their impact on the environment related ecosystems human health and issues related to monitoring and control of such a large number of diverse compounds e g bradley et al 2021 kolpin et al 2004 lapworth et al 2019 liu et al 1997 masoner et al 2019 padilla and vesper 2018 karst covers around 15 2 of the global continental land surface and it is estimated that between 16 5 of the world s population lives on karst areas goldscheider et al 2020 about 9 2 of the global population uses freshwater abstracted from karst aquifers stevanovic 2019 karst aquifers are a vital resource for drinking water in many parts of the world hartmann et al 2014 due to their natural characteristics they are highly vulnerable to contamination goldscheider 2005 karst aquifers are often characterized by the contrast of very low matrix porosity and high fracture and conduit porosity which results in rapid groundwater flow and low pollution attenuation ford and williams 2007 goldscheider and drew 2007 the croatian karst is part of the dinaric karst with an extremely high degree of karstification that results in large scale karst landforms high discharge springs with average discharges around ten m3 s and well developed conduit networks made up of large cave systems due to its high degree of karstification and long history of study the dinaric karst is commonly referred to as classical karst moreover these karst rocks often extend continuously over large areas uninterrupted by non karst rocks that would form fixed geological boundaries of underground watersheds determining recharge zones and managing and protecting water resources in such karstified aquifers is difficult and is made even more challenging in the dinaric region due to the transboundary nature of some catchments there are few studies of eocs in highly karstified aquifers lukač reberski et al 2022 and eoc contamination of very high discharge karst springs is not well characterised this study aims to provide some new insights into the impact of eocs on these types of large springs and on karst aquifers more generally it is the first regional assessment of the croatian dinaric karst with samples from 17 of the most significant karstic springs in the region and one lake partially fed by karst springs and lake vruljas all the sample sites are used for water supply and are geographically distributed across the karst region of croatia each site was sampled during both the spring and autumn seasons the specific objectives are to i determine which eocs are present and at what concentrations ii investigate the broad spatial distribution of eocs in the croatian karst iii determine whether there is a difference in the number and concentrations of eocs from samples taken in autumn and spring and iv explore links between eoc detections and land use in karst spring catchments results are also compared to eoc data from other karst studies reviewed by lukač reberski et al 2022 and other data from groundwater reviewed by lapworth et al 2012 2 study area the dinaric karst deposited during the middle triassic to the middle eocene period is famous as the type locality for karstic dissolutional landforms ford 2007 in croatia this karst covers nearly half of the land area chen et al 2017 fig 1 a and predominantly comprises limestones and dolomites that are very thick in some parts more than 8000 m vlahović et al 2005 the high solubility of these carbonate rocks and the intense tectonics in the geological past resulted in extensive karstification and well developed karst aquifers with high levels of heterogeneity unpredictability and complexity groundwater velocities based on results of 199 tracer tests conducted in the croatian karst range from 0 01 to 32 1 cm s or 0 009 to 27 7 km day with a median velocity of 2 3 cm s or 2 km day kuhta and brkić 2008 regarding relief and climate the croatian karst can be divided into two major areas inland hilly and mountainous areas with a moderately warm humid climate and a coastal belt with a mediterranean climate annual rainfall and average temperature range from 700 mm 17 c on the adriatic coast and islands to 3500 mm 5 c in the highest mountain locations despite the high precipitation due to the rapid vertical infiltration through the epikarst zone surface rivers networks are generally absent because of this and the rough terrain the continental karst area is the least populated in croatia with few urban areas and very little industrial activity most of the population lives along the coast downstream of the spring catchment zones which has positive affects on groundwater quality because there are relatively few pollutant sources in the spring catchments our working hypothesis is that the karst springs in croatia might be less impacted by eocs than other areas with a high level of karstification where there is more intense agricultural land use and larger urban and industrial areas within groundwater catchments such as the united kingdom france germany and usa lapworth et al 2015 lukač reberski et al 2022 mahler and musgrove 2019 3 material and methods 3 1 sampling and monitoring croatian karst groundwater was sampled at 18 locations 16 discharging springs one intermittent spring that emerges from the cave but on the days that sampling was undertaken the groundwater level was below the surface and the spring was not flowing therefore the sample was taken from the cave and one karst lake partially fed by springs and lake vruljas of the surrounding karst aquifer which is the only sampling point for the water supply of the islands of cres and lošinj fig 1a sampling sites were chosen based on two criteria 1 ensuring wide coverage of croatia s karst area and 2 selecting sites that are used for water supply sampling was undertaken in two separate campaigns spring 19 to 28 march 2019 and autumn 16 to 21 october 2019 to compare eocs at different times of the year in generally high and low rainfall periods discharge conditions were different on the two sampling occasions although due to the highly responsive nature of karst springs sampling did not capture discharge extremes samples were collected in pre cleaned 1 l glass bottles 1 bottle per sampling location provided by the national laboratory services uk nls uk where eocs were analysed blank and duplicate samples were taken in each campaign to verify the authenticity of the data data presented here were first blank corrected to remove compounds detected below concentrations found in the blank samples and to remove compounds introduced through the sample processing steps bottles were immediately stored at a cool place and shipped within one week samples were taken from as near to the spring sources as safely possible care was taken to minimise the risk of contamination e g bottles were submerged in the spring to minimise local surface contamination the sampler stood downstream and bottles were rinsed thoroughly with sample water which was discarded downstream before taking the sample 3 2 analytical methods the sample analysis was done at nls uk with agilent 6540 ultra high definition uhd accurate mass quadrupole time of flight q tof liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms of agilent technologies inc santa clara ca usa a detailed description of the analytical methods can be found in white et al 2019 the limit of detection lod for each analyte that was detected is available in supplementary table s1 this analytical method lc ms ms target and non target screen returns results for 740 different compounds the majority of compounds detected are considered to be newly emerging organic contaminants eocs i e they are not routinely globally regulated or monitored for hence we have used the term eocs throughout the manuscript however some of the compounds reported i e some pesticides and some industrial compounds are monitored and regulated in some countries but this varies considerably from one region to another 3 3 land cover and hydrological data to investigate the impact of land use on groundwater quality corine land cover clc 2018 spatial data sets were used the first level of the clc classification system was applied which comprise three categories 1 urban this category includes developed inhabited industrial areas with many potential sources of eocs including both domestic and industrial wastewater which may provide sources of pharmaceuticals as well as industrial contaminants 2 agricultural crops or livestock this category is likely to be the main source of pesticides but also a source of pharmaceuticals 3 natural this comprises forest and upland karst areas which are semi natural and likely to have few sources of eocs long term discharge and water level data were collected from the croatian meteorological and hydrological service 4 results 4 1 eoc compounds in croatian karst water of the 740 compounds analysed sixty five different compounds were identified in the croatian karst groundwater with a total of 277 detections see supplementary information table s2 for all results per location eocs were detected at all sites and in 34 of the 35 samples the only sample with no eocs detected was the sample from the novljanska žrnovnica spring in october 2019 pharmaceutical and agricultural compounds were detected most frequently fig 2 a and b and the highest concentrations were from the industrial and personal care product and lifestyle compound pcp ls groups fig 2a and c the maximum concentrations of eocs in the croatian karst were compared to those detected in other studies of karst groundwater from around the world compiled from 32 studies and reported in lukač reberski et al 2022 which include a wide range of karst aquifers with different hydrogeological characteristics global karst groundwater in fig 3 a a comparison was also made to maximum concentrations of eocs found in groundwater more generally including non karst aquifers using data from 46 studies compiled by lapworth et al 2012 all types groundwater in fig 3a there have been many studies of eocs in groundwater since 2012 which are not included here as compiling these data is beyond the scope of the current field study but the data from lapworth et al 2012 provide a good preliminary comparison overall maximum eoc concentrations in the croatian karst are relatively low almost half of the detected substances had maximum concentrations below one ng l which is two or more orders of magnitude lower than most of the maximum concentrations from studies of other karst aquifers the number of industrial pharmaceutical and pcp lsc compounds detected was much higher in other studies of karst groundwaters than in the croatian karst although the number of agricultural compounds detected was slightly higher in the croatian karst fig 3b however for those compounds that were detected in both croatian groundwater and in other studies they were detected more frequently in croatian karst groundwater fig 3c the detection limits of the analytical methods vary between studies and this could influence the comparisons at each site the total number of detected compounds in both sampling campaigns was compared to the total concentration the sum of the concentrations of all the pollutants detected at the site from both samples the objective was to provide insights into how the number of pollutants present compares to the total pollutant load in these waters whilst as expected the relationship is positive it is non linear fig 4 three clusters of springs can be identified sites with low numbers of detected compounds and low total concentration sites with moderate numbers of compounds and relatively high concentrations of detected eocs and sites with high numbers of compounds and high concentrations 4 2 spatial and temporal patterns in eocs in croatian karst springs 4 2 1 spatial distribution there is no clear spatial pattern in eocs in the croatian karst there is no apparent difference in total concentrations or the number of detected eoc compounds at individual sampling locations between the coastal and continental areas fig 5 a and b personal care products and lifestyle compounds generally had the highest concentrations 14 out of 18 sites fig 5a pharmaceuticals are the most commonly detected compounds at most sites 11 out of 18 sites followed by agricultural compounds fig 5b the catchments range from 24 to 1747 km2 and cover roughly 30 of the croatian karst region this part of croatia is sparsely populated and industrial activity is poorly developed as seen by the low proportion of urban areas fig 5c in most cases urban areas cover less than 1 of the catchment except for two coastal springs zvir 11 and golubinka 10 natural land cover dominates the catchments of all the investigated springs ranging from 57 to 93 of the catchment areas as shown in fig 5c agricultural land covers between 7 and 41 of the catchment areas mean 20 indicating considerable agricultural activities in the catchments 4 2 2 spring flows and comparison of sampling campaigns in march and october the sampled springs generally have very high discharges with mean discharge ranging from one to a few tens of m3 s and some maximum discharges exceeding one hundred m3 s fig 6 although hydrological extremes were not captured the discharge did differ between the two campaigns in the march sampling campaign discharges ranged from 0 to 12 3 m3 s and in the october from 0 to 34 8 m3 s although at all but one spring the discharge was higher in march than in october most springs in the dinaric karst have a rapid response to rainfall and therefore discharge can vary substantially in short timescales at all times of the year bonacci 2015 however typically discharges are expected to be significantly higher in march than in october https hidro dhz hr the hydrological year 2018 2019 was not typical with very low precipitation during the autumn and winter months and at most sites discharges in march were below average at 16 out of 17 locations despite the differences in season and spring discharge the type and number of detected eoc compounds as well as the concentrations were similar in both campaigns at most sampling sites fig 7 a for example the four springs with the highest number of detected compounds and highest total concentrations golubinka prud rakonek and kupica had the highest concentrations and number of detected compounds in both campaigns with generally similar types of eocs present on both occasions fig 5b 6 and 7a it is also the case that at 11 sample sites the difference in the total number of compounds between the two campaigns was less than 2 fig 7a and the difference in total concentrations at 14 sites was less than 50 ng l the biggest difference in the total number of detected compounds between the two campaigns was at zagorska mrežnica where more compounds were detected in october at four sampling locations differences in the total number of detected compounds between the two sampling campaigns were more than 50 zagorska mrežnica opačac tonković and miljacka fig 7a see supplementary material table s3 a general comparison of the two sampling campaigns is provided in table 1 eleven springs had a higher total number of detected eocs in march while total concentrations were higher at half of the springs in march and at the other half in october considering the type of eoc pharmaceutical compounds were detected substantially more in march than in october although concentrations were higher in october see supplementary material table s3 other types of eoc compounds were detected in similar numbers during both campaigns despite the broad similarities between the type number and concentrations observed in the two sampling campaigns the individual compounds detected were different during the two campaigns less than half of the total detected compounds were found in both campaigns although in these cases their concentrations in both campaigns were of the same order of magnitude see supplementary material table s3 to estimate eoc environmental loads mass fluxes were calculated for both sampling campaigns for each sampling location mass fluxes were obtained by multiplying the total eoc concentrations measured at each sampling site by the spring discharge at the sampling time mass fluxes have a very big range from 10 to 106 ng s at the sampled springs with differences between the two campaigns at most sites fig 7b however there is no consistent pattern in these differences with mass fluxes higher in october at five sampling locations and higher in march at eight fig 7b 4 3 relationship of eocs with land use and hydrochemical indicators to analyse the strength and direction of the relationship between individual land cover categories and the type number or concentration of eocs cross plots fig 8 a f were created these plots do not indicate strong relationships between the land cover categories and the eocs observed at the springs there appears to be a very weak negative correlation r2 0 2 between the proportion of natural land cover where pollution sources would be expected to be low and the amount of eoc contamination with those sites with a more natural land cover having lower total concentrations and lower numbers of eoc compounds detected fig 8a b fig 8c and d show the relationships between the proportion of catchments with agricultural land cover and the total concentration of agricultural compounds detected at the sampling sites and the total number of agricultural compounds detected due to the seasonal nature of agricultural activities separate analyses for both campaigns are shown although there are positive correlations in these plots the relationships are weak r2 ranges from 0 08 to 0 25 and are not statistically significant at the p 0 05 level cross plots of individual eoc groups and the proportion of land use type were also made since most pharmaceuticals detected in croatian karst groundwater are for both human and veterinary use a relationship between the proportion of agricultural land and pharmaceuticals was analysed fig 8e and the results showed a very weak positive correlation r2 0 02 which is statistically significant stronger positive correlations r2 0 28 were found for the relationship between the number of detected pharmaceuticals and the proportion of urban land fig 8f a comparison of the proportion of urban land and the pcp ls compounds showed a moderate r2 0 34 but statistically significant positive correlation but there was no correlation between urban land cover and industrial compounds fig 8f given that only artificial sweeteners which can be used in animal nutrition were detected in the group of pcp ls compounds the relationship between pcp ls compounds and the proportion of agricultural land was analysed fig 8e they showed weak relationships and the correlations were not statistically significant 5 discussion out of the 65 detected compounds in the croatian karst springs nine were among both the most frequently detected and the compounds with the highest concentration suggesting that these are potentially the most widespread and significant eocs in croatia out of the 740 compounds included in this analysis these are acesulfame sucralose perfluorobutanesulfonic acid pfbs carbamazepine lamotrigine desethylatrazine hydrochlorothiazide cotinine and bentazone fig 2a and c carbamazepine is the most frequently detected eoc in both croatian karst and in other studies of karst groundwater reviewed by lukač reberski et al 2022 in contrast paracetamol which is among the top 20 compounds in terms of both concentration and detection frequency in other karst groundwater studies does not currently appear to be an important contaminant in the croatian karst with just a single detection in the croatian karst several substances were detected above or near the concentration of 100 ng l the current eu drinking water limit for any individual pesticide substance eu directive 2020 2184 these are acesulfame sucralose pfbs emamectin b1b and triphenyl phosphate tppa these substances except tppa are very persistent in the aquatic environment belton et al 2020 benson et al 2017 echa 2019 saeger et al 1979 yang et al 2021 tppa a widely used flame retardant and plasticiser stapleton et al 2009 was detected at two springs situated in the continental part of the croatian karst tonković and kupica it was only detected in the march sample at these sites but it was present in substantially higher concentrations compared to most other industrial compounds that were detected at other sampling locations tppa is indicative of rapid conduit flow from the pollutant source to the karst spring because it is subject to biodegradation in the aquatic environment with a half life of 2 4 days pubchem 2022 and because groundwater is less likely to contain phosphate esters due to their potential to adsorb to soils and sediments atsdr 2012 thus its presence is a helpful indicator of short groundwater residence times since karst environments provide a diversity of habitats for many different species gibert et al 1994 goldscheider 2019 we evaluated the impact of detected eocs on ecosystems the highest concentrations of chemicals detected in the croatian karst groundwater were compared with the corresponding pnec predicted no effect concentration values walker et al 2012 a chemical s pnec value is the concentration below which there are no observable harmful impacts on an ecosystem from exposure increased levels of emamectin b1b and tppa in the environment may be some of the first to cause negative effects due to their low predicted pnec values of 0 13 µg l and 0 74 µg l respectively the pnec value for pfbs is 4 08 µg l while artificial sweeteners have somewhat higher values of 72 40 µg l for acesulfame and 29 7 µg l for sucralose in the croatian karst springs acesulfame sucralose and pfbs have environmental concentrations 482 68 and 58 times greater than their pnec values respectively whilst ttpa and emamectin b1b have environmental concentrations that are 8 and 1 2 times higher thus the results from this study suggest that these contaminants may pose an imminent threat to ecosystem health in croatian karst groundwater a key observation from the eoc data for the croatian karst springs is that concentrations of most of the detected compounds are much lower compared to those found in other karst groundwaters lukač reberski et al 2022 fig 3a it is most likely that the lower concentrations reflect the high dilution of contaminants in the croatian karst springs as most of the sampled springs have very high discharge rates and the land use data indicate that much of the catchments comprise natural land use fig 5c and hence may enable recharge with very low contaminant mass to dilute any contaminated groundwater however despite the low concentrations of eocs in the croatian karst the mass contaminant fluxes are often high fig 7b although higher discharges may lead to higher dilution and consequently lower concentration of compounds the overall mass flux can be high in springs with large discharges as a result it s crucial to consider mass fluxes in addition to concentrations particularly in the case of high discharge springs where low concentrations may still reflect an overall high contaminant load having a more significant impact on dependent ecosystems than would be predicted based solely on concentrations very variable and at times high mass fluxes observed in this study are consistent with the investigation of a karst aquifer with similar characteristics reported by doummar and aoun 2018 the number and detection frequency of contaminants in the croatian karst are considerable fig 3b especially given the area s sparse population and low levels of industrial activity the detection limits of analytical methods vary between studies and this could influence the comparisons it also reflects the highly karstic nature of the classical karst aquifer with fast groundwater flow and lower attenuation capabilities and is also an indication that pollutant sources are widespread in croatia despite the relatively low levels of development and urbanisation in the catchments of the investigated karst springs the lack of a spatial pattern in total concentration total number of detected compounds or types of compounds fig 5a and b also reflects the highly heterogeneous nature of karst with local variations in hydrogeological characteristics as well as variable anthropogenic influences different land use pollutant sources and management practices in the catchment areas a cross plot of the total number of detected compounds and concentrations shows three distinct clusters fig 4 but a more in depth analysis failed to establish a link between the sampling sites within individual clusters which have no geographical pattern there were also no systematic differences between springs that are located in the coastal areas and those that are in the inland mountainous areas suggesting that local variations in karst are more important than geographical patterns the highly karstic nature of the aquifer is also reflected in the significant differences in the number of detected compounds and their concentrations between the two sampling campaigns at some locations with no apparent relationship with discharge or season fig 7a and b supplementary materials s2 and s3 table 1 observed variations are likely to reflect a combination of the change in discharge different land use practices during different seasons and the highly variable and localised nature of individual karst spring response to recharge where even small changes in discharges can lead to significant differences in groundwater flow paths thus activating different parts of the aquifer system land use is likely to have a significant impact on the type and concentration of eocs but the challenges in determining the catchment boundaries in highly karstified areas and the complexities of the karst systems make this relationship unclear fig 8 the extremely high discharge of many croatian karst springs and hence the large catchment areas means that identifying specific sources of eocs is especially difficult although the three springs with the highest total concentrations and number of detected eoc compounds prud 5 golubinka 10 and rakonek 13 have the highest proportion of urban and or agricultural land cover in their catchments relationships between land use and contaminant presence and concentration are generally weak or absent a slightly better correlation r2 0 25 was found between agricultural land use and the number of agricultural compounds detected in the october campaign fig 8d which could be explained by the timing of the ending of the agricultural season when plant protection products are extensively used the fact that the agricultural land use category also includes pastures clc 2018 and that animal density is typically low throughout the croatian karst might be one of the causes of the overall weak correlation between eocs and the proportion of the catchment with agricultural land use another challenge is airborne transport of pesticides e g clifford et al 2016 unsworth et al 1999 which could result in pesticides in areas with other land uses pcp ls and pharmaceutical compounds can originate from either agricultural or urban sources the correlation results might suggest that the primary sources in croatian karst are urban areas i e wastewater fig 8e and f this is in line with previous findings in a highly karstified aquifer doummar and aoun 2018 zemann et al 2015 however it remains unclear why paracetamol which is mainly intended for human use savides et al 1984 and proven to be a good wastewater indicator godfrey et al 2007 was only detected once in the croatian karst the low detection frequency for paracetamol and the fact that most of the pharmaceuticals detected in this study are intended for both human and veterinary use e g carbamazepine point to the origin of pharmaceuticals in croatian karst groundwater being mainly from agricultural sources the dominance of agricultural land use in study catchments also supports this hypothesis 6 conclusion and future outlook 1 a total of 65 different contaminants were present with 277 detections from 35 samples five compounds were found at concentrations close to or exceeding eu standards and concentrations of some eocs exceeded pnec values indicating that they are likely to be impacting aquatic ecosystems agricultural industrial pharmaceutical and pcp ls compounds were all detected at most sites pharmaceutical and agricultural compounds were detected most frequently whilst the highest concentrations were in industrial and personal care product and lifestyle compound groups of 35 samples only one had no detected eocs 2 eoc compounds were detected frequently and often with high mass fluxes further indicating the vulnerability of the croatian karst tppa with a half life of 3 4 days was present at two sites and could be useful in vulnerability assessments as an indicator of rapid groundwater flow 3 the lower concentrations found in this study compared with other karst groundwater studies may reflect pollutant dillution due to the exceptionally high discharge of the classical karst springs it could also reflect the relatively large proportion of natural land cover present in the studied catchments however due to the high spring discharges the mass fluxes of eoc pollutants were considerable 10 to 106 ng s 4 agriculture appears to be a major source of eoc contamination in the croatian karst with high proportions of agricultural land use and many of the eocs detected are likely to have an agricultural source however the percentage of agricultural land use in the catchment generally had no or only a very weak correlation with the number of detected compounds concentrations this is likely to reflect the large size of the studied catchments the complexity of karst pollution transport and the potential for long range atmospheric transport of pesticides further work at the individual catchment scale is needed to understand the relationship between land use and eocs in the croatian karst which would also provide valuable insights into the transport and attenuation of eocs in karst more generally 5 data from two sampling campaigns show the high variability of eoc contamination in karst springs such changes would be expected in karst where spring discharges and karst conduit flow paths vary substantially on both seasonal and sometimes hourly daily timescales these results highlight the need for

uk nls starcross lab staplake mount starcross exeter ex6 8fd uk corresponding author graphical abstract emerging organic contaminants eocs have become of increasing interest due to concerns about their impact on humans and the wider environment karst aquifers are globally widespread providing critical water supplies and sustaining rivers and ecosystems and are particularly susceptible to pollution however eoc distributions in karst remain quite poorly understood this study looks at the occurrence of eocs in the croatian karst which is an example of the classical karst a highly developed type of karst that occurs throughout the dinaric region of europe samples were collected from 17 karst springs and one karst lake used for water supply in croatia during two sampling campaigns from a screen of 740 compounds a total of 65 compounds were detected eoc compounds from the pharmaceutical n 26 and agrochemical groups n 26 were the most frequently detected while industrials and artificial sweeteners had the highest concentrations range 8 440 ng l the number of detected compounds and the frequency of detection demonstrate the vulnerability of karst to eoc pollution concentrations of 5 compounds acesulfame sucralose perfluorobutane sulfonate emamectin b1b and triphenyl phosphate exceeded eu standards and occurred at concentrations that are likely to be harmful to ecosystems overall most detections were at low concentrations 50 1 ng l this may be due to high dilution within the exceptionally large springs of the classical karst or due to relatively few pollution sources within the catchments nevertheless eoc fluxes are considerable 10 to 106 ng s due to the high discharge of the springs temporal differences were observed but without a clear pattern reflecting the highly variable nature of karst springs that occurs over both seasonal and short term timescales this research is one of a handful of regional eoc investigations in karst groundwater and the first regional study in the dinaric karst it demonstrates the need for more frequent and extensive sampling of eocs in karst to protect human health and the environment keywords emerging organic contaminants karst aquifers dinaric karst groundwater drinking water resources data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction emerging organic contaminants eocs are anthropogenic micropollutants that are typically difficult to identify in aquatic environments due to their low concentrations in the last decade technological advances have made detection of a wide range of eocs in water possible with increasing numbers of studies muter and bartkevics 2020 richardson and kimura 2020 schmidt 2018 growing evidence for their presence in surface and groundwater systems has raised lots of new questions about their impact on the environment related ecosystems human health and issues related to monitoring and control of such a large number of diverse compounds e g bradley et al 2021 kolpin et al 2004 lapworth et al 2019 liu et al 1997 masoner et al 2019 padilla and vesper 2018 karst covers around 15 2 of the global continental land surface and it is estimated that between 16 5 of the world s population lives on karst areas goldscheider et al 2020 about 9 2 of the global population uses freshwater abstracted from karst aquifers stevanovic 2019 karst aquifers are a vital resource for drinking water in many parts of the world hartmann et al 2014 due to their natural characteristics they are highly vulnerable to contamination goldscheider 2005 karst aquifers are often characterized by the contrast of very low matrix porosity and high fracture and conduit porosity which results in rapid groundwater flow and low pollution attenuation ford and williams 2007 goldscheider and drew 2007 the croatian karst is part of the dinaric karst with an extremely high degree of karstification that results in large scale karst landforms high discharge springs with average discharges around ten m3 s and well developed conduit networks made up of large cave systems due to its high degree of karstification and long history of study the dinaric karst is commonly referred to as classical karst moreover these karst rocks often extend continuously over large areas uninterrupted by non karst rocks that would form fixed geological boundaries of underground watersheds determining recharge zones and managing and protecting water resources in such karstified aquifers is difficult and is made even more challenging in the dinaric region due to the transboundary nature of some catchments there are few studies of eocs in highly karstified aquifers lukač reberski et al 2022 and eoc contamination of very high discharge karst springs is not well characterised this study aims to provide some new insights into the impact of eocs on these types of large springs and on karst aquifers more generally it is the first regional assessment of the croatian dinaric karst with samples from 17 of the most significant karstic springs in the region and one lake partially fed by karst springs and lake vruljas all the sample sites are used for water supply and are geographically distributed across the karst region of croatia each site was sampled during both the spring and autumn seasons the specific objectives are to i determine which eocs are present and at what concentrations ii investigate the broad spatial distribution of eocs in the croatian karst iii determine whether there is a difference in the number and concentrations of eocs from samples taken in autumn and spring and iv explore links between eoc detections and land use in karst spring catchments results are also compared to eoc data from other karst studies reviewed by lukač reberski et al 2022 and other data from groundwater reviewed by lapworth et al 2012 2 study area the dinaric karst deposited during the middle triassic to the middle eocene period is famous as the type locality for karstic dissolutional landforms ford 2007 in croatia this karst covers nearly half of the land area chen et al 2017 fig 1 a and predominantly comprises limestones and dolomites that are very thick in some parts more than 8000 m vlahović et al 2005 the high solubility of these carbonate rocks and the intense tectonics in the geological past resulted in extensive karstification and well developed karst aquifers with high levels of heterogeneity unpredictability and complexity groundwater velocities based on results of 199 tracer tests conducted in the croatian karst range from 0 01 to 32 1 cm s or 0 009 to 27 7 km day with a median velocity of 2 3 cm s or 2 km day kuhta and brkić 2008 regarding relief and climate the croatian karst can be divided into two major areas inland hilly and mountainous areas with a moderately warm humid climate and a coastal belt with a mediterranean climate annual rainfall and average temperature range from 700 mm 17 c on the adriatic coast and islands to 3500 mm 5 c in the highest mountain locations despite the high precipitation due to the rapid vertical infiltration through the epikarst zone surface rivers networks are generally absent because of this and the rough terrain the continental karst area is the least populated in croatia with few urban areas and very little industrial activity most of the population lives along the coast downstream of the spring catchment zones which has positive affects on groundwater quality because there are relatively few pollutant sources in the spring catchments our working hypothesis is that the karst springs in croatia might be less impacted by eocs than other areas with a high level of karstification where there is more intense agricultural land use and larger urban and industrial areas within groundwater catchments such as the united kingdom france germany and usa lapworth et al 2015 lukač reberski et al 2022 mahler and musgrove 2019 3 material and methods 3 1 sampling and monitoring croatian karst groundwater was sampled at 18 locations 16 discharging springs one intermittent spring that emerges from the cave but on the days that sampling was undertaken the groundwater level was below the surface and the spring was not flowing therefore the sample was taken from the cave and one karst lake partially fed by springs and lake vruljas of the surrounding karst aquifer which is the only sampling point for the water supply of the islands of cres and lošinj fig 1a sampling sites were chosen based on two criteria 1 ensuring wide coverage of croatia s karst area and 2 selecting sites that are used for water supply sampling was undertaken in two separate campaigns spring 19 to 28 march 2019 and autumn 16 to 21 october 2019 to compare eocs at different times of the year in generally high and low rainfall periods discharge conditions were different on the two sampling occasions although due to the highly responsive nature of karst springs sampling did not capture discharge extremes samples were collected in pre cleaned 1 l glass bottles 1 bottle per sampling location provided by the national laboratory services uk nls uk where eocs were analysed blank and duplicate samples were taken in each campaign to verify the authenticity of the data data presented here were first blank corrected to remove compounds detected below concentrations found in the blank samples and to remove compounds introduced through the sample processing steps bottles were immediately stored at a cool place and shipped within one week samples were taken from as near to the spring sources as safely possible care was taken to minimise the risk of contamination e g bottles were submerged in the spring to minimise local surface contamination the sampler stood downstream and bottles were rinsed thoroughly with sample water which was discarded downstream before taking the sample 3 2 analytical methods the sample analysis was done at nls uk with agilent 6540 ultra high definition uhd accurate mass quadrupole time of flight q tof liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms of agilent technologies inc santa clara ca usa a detailed description of the analytical methods can be found in white et al 2019 the limit of detection lod for each analyte that was detected is available in supplementary table s1 this analytical method lc ms ms target and non target screen returns results for 740 different compounds the majority of compounds detected are considered to be newly emerging organic contaminants eocs i e they are not routinely globally regulated or monitored for hence we have used the term eocs throughout the manuscript however some of the compounds reported i e some pesticides and some industrial compounds are monitored and regulated in some countries but this varies considerably from one region to another 3 3 land cover and hydrological data to investigate the impact of land use on groundwater quality corine land cover clc 2018 spatial data sets were used the first level of the clc classification system was applied which comprise three categories 1 urban this category includes developed inhabited industrial areas with many potential sources of eocs including both domestic and industrial wastewater which may provide sources of pharmaceuticals as well as industrial contaminants 2 agricultural crops or livestock this category is likely to be the main source of pesticides but also a source of pharmaceuticals 3 natural this comprises forest and upland karst areas which are semi natural and likely to have few sources of eocs long term discharge and water level data were collected from the croatian meteorological and hydrological service 4 results 4 1 eoc compounds in croatian karst water of the 740 compounds analysed sixty five different compounds were identified in the croatian karst groundwater with a total of 277 detections see supplementary information table s2 for all results per location eocs were detected at all sites and in 34 of the 35 samples the only sample with no eocs detected was the sample from the novljanska žrnovnica spring in october 2019 pharmaceutical and agricultural compounds were detected most frequently fig 2 a and b and the highest concentrations were from the industrial and personal care product and lifestyle compound pcp ls groups fig 2a and c the maximum concentrations of eocs in the croatian karst were compared to those detected in other studies of karst groundwater from around the world compiled from 32 studies and reported in lukač reberski et al 2022 which include a wide range of karst aquifers with different hydrogeological characteristics global karst groundwater in fig 3 a a comparison was also made to maximum concentrations of eocs found in groundwater more generally including non karst aquifers using data from 46 studies compiled by lapworth et al 2012 all types groundwater in fig 3a there have been many studies of eocs in groundwater since 2012 which are not included here as compiling these data is beyond the scope of the current field study but the data from lapworth et al 2012 provide a good preliminary comparison overall maximum eoc concentrations in the croatian karst are relatively low almost half of the detected substances had maximum concentrations below one ng l which is two or more orders of magnitude lower than most of the maximum concentrations from studies of other karst aquifers the number of industrial pharmaceutical and pcp lsc compounds detected was much higher in other studies of karst groundwaters than in the croatian karst although the number of agricultural compounds detected was slightly higher in the croatian karst fig 3b however for those compounds that were detected in both croatian groundwater and in other studies they were detected more frequently in croatian karst groundwater fig 3c the detection limits of the analytical methods vary between studies and this could influence the comparisons at each site the total number of detected compounds in both sampling campaigns was compared to the total concentration the sum of the concentrations of all the pollutants detected at the site from both samples the objective was to provide insights into how the number of pollutants present compares to the total pollutant load in these waters whilst as expected the relationship is positive it is non linear fig 4 three clusters of springs can be identified sites with low numbers of detected compounds and low total concentration sites with moderate numbers of compounds and relatively high concentrations of detected eocs and sites with high numbers of compounds and high concentrations 4 2 spatial and temporal patterns in eocs in croatian karst springs 4 2 1 spatial distribution there is no clear spatial pattern in eocs in the croatian karst there is no apparent difference in total concentrations or the number of detected eoc compounds at individual sampling locations between the coastal and continental areas fig 5 a and b personal care products and lifestyle compounds generally had the highest concentrations 14 out of 18 sites fig 5a pharmaceuticals are the most commonly detected compounds at most sites 11 out of 18 sites followed by agricultural compounds fig 5b the catchments range from 24 to 1747 km2 and cover roughly 30 of the croatian karst region this part of croatia is sparsely populated and industrial activity is poorly developed as seen by the low proportion of urban areas fig 5c in most cases urban areas cover less than 1 of the catchment except for two coastal springs zvir 11 and golubinka 10 natural land cover dominates the catchments of all the investigated springs ranging from 57 to 93 of the catchment areas as shown in fig 5c agricultural land covers between 7 and 41 of the catchment areas mean 20 indicating considerable agricultural activities in the catchments 4 2 2 spring flows and comparison of sampling campaigns in march and october the sampled springs generally have very high discharges with mean discharge ranging from one to a few tens of m3 s and some maximum discharges exceeding one hundred m3 s fig 6 although hydrological extremes were not captured the discharge did differ between the two campaigns in the march sampling campaign discharges ranged from 0 to 12 3 m3 s and in the october from 0 to 34 8 m3 s although at all but one spring the discharge was higher in march than in october most springs in the dinaric karst have a rapid response to rainfall and therefore discharge can vary substantially in short timescales at all times of the year bonacci 2015 however typically discharges are expected to be significantly higher in march than in october https hidro dhz hr the hydrological year 2018 2019 was not typical with very low precipitation during the autumn and winter months and at most sites discharges in march were below average at 16 out of 17 locations despite the differences in season and spring discharge the type and number of detected eoc compounds as well as the concentrations were similar in both campaigns at most sampling sites fig 7 a for example the four springs with the highest number of detected compounds and highest total concentrations golubinka prud rakonek and kupica had the highest concentrations and number of detected compounds in both campaigns with generally similar types of eocs present on both occasions fig 5b 6 and 7a it is also the case that at 11 sample sites the difference in the total number of compounds between the two campaigns was less than 2 fig 7a and the difference in total concentrations at 14 sites was less than 50 ng l the biggest difference in the total number of detected compounds between the two campaigns was at zagorska mrežnica where more compounds were detected in october at four sampling locations differences in the total number of detected compounds between the two sampling campaigns were more than 50 zagorska mrežnica opačac tonković and miljacka fig 7a see supplementary material table s3 a general comparison of the two sampling campaigns is provided in table 1 eleven springs had a higher total number of detected eocs in march while total concentrations were higher at half of the springs in march and at the other half in october considering the type of eoc pharmaceutical compounds were detected substantially more in march than in october although concentrations were higher in october see supplementary material table s3 other types of eoc compounds were detected in similar numbers during both campaigns despite the broad similarities between the type number and concentrations observed in the two sampling campaigns the individual compounds detected were different during the two campaigns less than half of the total detected compounds were found in both campaigns although in these cases their concentrations in both campaigns were of the same order of magnitude see supplementary material table s3 to estimate eoc environmental loads mass fluxes were calculated for both sampling campaigns for each sampling location mass fluxes were obtained by multiplying the total eoc concentrations measured at each sampling site by the spring discharge at the sampling time mass fluxes have a very big range from 10 to 106 ng s at the sampled springs with differences between the two campaigns at most sites fig 7b however there is no consistent pattern in these differences with mass fluxes higher in october at five sampling locations and higher in march at eight fig 7b 4 3 relationship of eocs with land use and hydrochemical indicators to analyse the strength and direction of the relationship between individual land cover categories and the type number or concentration of eocs cross plots fig 8 a f were created these plots do not indicate strong relationships between the land cover categories and the eocs observed at the springs there appears to be a very weak negative correlation r2 0 2 between the proportion of natural land cover where pollution sources would be expected to be low and the amount of eoc contamination with those sites with a more natural land cover having lower total concentrations and lower numbers of eoc compounds detected fig 8a b fig 8c and d show the relationships between the proportion of catchments with agricultural land cover and the total concentration of agricultural compounds detected at the sampling sites and the total number of agricultural compounds detected due to the seasonal nature of agricultural activities separate analyses for both campaigns are shown although there are positive correlations in these plots the relationships are weak r2 ranges from 0 08 to 0 25 and are not statistically significant at the p 0 05 level cross plots of individual eoc groups and the proportion of land use type were also made since most pharmaceuticals detected in croatian karst groundwater are for both human and veterinary use a relationship between the proportion of agricultural land and pharmaceuticals was analysed fig 8e and the results showed a very weak positive correlation r2 0 02 which is statistically significant stronger positive correlations r2 0 28 were found for the relationship between the number of detected pharmaceuticals and the proportion of urban land fig 8f a comparison of the proportion of urban land and the pcp ls compounds showed a moderate r2 0 34 but statistically significant positive correlation but there was no correlation between urban land cover and industrial compounds fig 8f given that only artificial sweeteners which can be used in animal nutrition were detected in the group of pcp ls compounds the relationship between pcp ls compounds and the proportion of agricultural land was analysed fig 8e they showed weak relationships and the correlations were not statistically significant 5 discussion out of the 65 detected compounds in the croatian karst springs nine were among both the most frequently detected and the compounds with the highest concentration suggesting that these are potentially the most widespread and significant eocs in croatia out of the 740 compounds included in this analysis these are acesulfame sucralose perfluorobutanesulfonic acid pfbs carbamazepine lamotrigine desethylatrazine hydrochlorothiazide cotinine and bentazone fig 2a and c carbamazepine is the most frequently detected eoc in both croatian karst and in other studies of karst groundwater reviewed by lukač reberski et al 2022 in contrast paracetamol which is among the top 20 compounds in terms of both concentration and detection frequency in other karst groundwater studies does not currently appear to be an important contaminant in the croatian karst with just a single detection in the croatian karst several substances were detected above or near the concentration of 100 ng l the current eu drinking water limit for any individual pesticide substance eu directive 2020 2184 these are acesulfame sucralose pfbs emamectin b1b and triphenyl phosphate tppa these substances except tppa are very persistent in the aquatic environment belton et al 2020 benson et al 2017 echa 2019 saeger et al 1979 yang et al 2021 tppa a widely used flame retardant and plasticiser stapleton et al 2009 was detected at two springs situated in the continental part of the croatian karst tonković and kupica it was only detected in the march sample at these sites but it was present in substantially higher concentrations compared to most other industrial compounds that were detected at other sampling locations tppa is indicative of rapid conduit flow from the pollutant source to the karst spring because it is subject to biodegradation in the aquatic environment with a half life of 2 4 days pubchem 2022 and because groundwater is less likely to contain phosphate esters due to their potential to adsorb to soils and sediments atsdr 2012 thus its presence is a helpful indicator of short groundwater residence times since karst environments provide a diversity of habitats for many different species gibert et al 1994 goldscheider 2019 we evaluated the impact of detected eocs on ecosystems the highest concentrations of chemicals detected in the croatian karst groundwater were compared with the corresponding pnec predicted no effect concentration values walker et al 2012 a chemical s pnec value is the concentration below which there are no observable harmful impacts on an ecosystem from exposure increased levels of emamectin b1b and tppa in the environment may be some of the first to cause negative effects due to their low predicted pnec values of 0 13 µg l and 0 74 µg l respectively the pnec value for pfbs is 4 08 µg l while artificial sweeteners have somewhat higher values of 72 40 µg l for acesulfame and 29 7 µg l for sucralose in the croatian karst springs acesulfame sucralose and pfbs have environmental concentrations 482 68 and 58 times greater than their pnec values respectively whilst ttpa and emamectin b1b have environmental concentrations that are 8 and 1 2 times higher thus the results from this study suggest that these contaminants may pose an imminent threat to ecosystem health in croatian karst groundwater a key observation from the eoc data for the croatian karst springs is that concentrations of most of the detected compounds are much lower compared to those found in other karst groundwaters lukač reberski et al 2022 fig 3a it is most likely that the lower concentrations reflect the high dilution of contaminants in the croatian karst springs as most of the sampled springs have very high discharge rates and the land use data indicate that much of the catchments comprise natural land use fig 5c and hence may enable recharge with very low contaminant mass to dilute any contaminated groundwater however despite the low concentrations of eocs in the croatian karst the mass contaminant fluxes are often high fig 7b although higher discharges may lead to higher dilution and consequently lower concentration of compounds the overall mass flux can be high in springs with large discharges as a result it s crucial to consider mass fluxes in addition to concentrations particularly in the case of high discharge springs where low concentrations may still reflect an overall high contaminant load having a more significant impact on dependent ecosystems than would be predicted based solely on concentrations very variable and at times high mass fluxes observed in this study are consistent with the investigation of a karst aquifer with similar characteristics reported by doummar and aoun 2018 the number and detection frequency of contaminants in the croatian karst are considerable fig 3b especially given the area s sparse population and low levels of industrial activity the detection limits of analytical methods vary between studies and this could influence the comparisons it also reflects the highly karstic nature of the classical karst aquifer with fast groundwater flow and lower attenuation capabilities and is also an indication that pollutant sources are widespread in croatia despite the relatively low levels of development and urbanisation in the catchments of the investigated karst springs the lack of a spatial pattern in total concentration total number of detected compounds or types of compounds fig 5a and b also reflects the highly heterogeneous nature of karst with local variations in hydrogeological characteristics as well as variable anthropogenic influences different land use pollutant sources and management practices in the catchment areas a cross plot of the total number of detected compounds and concentrations shows three distinct clusters fig 4 but a more in depth analysis failed to establish a link between the sampling sites within individual clusters which have no geographical pattern there were also no systematic differences between springs that are located in the coastal areas and those that are in the inland mountainous areas suggesting that local variations in karst are more important than geographical patterns the highly karstic nature of the aquifer is also reflected in the significant differences in the number of detected compounds and their concentrations between the two sampling campaigns at some locations with no apparent relationship with discharge or season fig 7a and b supplementary materials s2 and s3 table 1 observed variations are likely to reflect a combination of the change in discharge different land use practices during different seasons and the highly variable and localised nature of individual karst spring response to recharge where even small changes in discharges can lead to significant differences in groundwater flow paths thus activating different parts of the aquifer system land use is likely to have a significant impact on the type and concentration of eocs but the challenges in determining the catchment boundaries in highly karstified areas and the complexities of the karst systems make this relationship unclear fig 8 the extremely high discharge of many croatian karst springs and hence the large catchment areas means that identifying specific sources of eocs is especially difficult although the three springs with the highest total concentrations and number of detected eoc compounds prud 5 golubinka 10 and rakonek 13 have the highest proportion of urban and or agricultural land cover in their catchments relationships between land use and contaminant presence and concentration are generally weak or absent a slightly better correlation r2 0 25 was found between agricultural land use and the number of agricultural compounds detected in the october campaign fig 8d which could be explained by the timing of the ending of the agricultural season when plant protection products are extensively used the fact that the agricultural land use category also includes pastures clc 2018 and that animal density is typically low throughout the croatian karst might be one of the causes of the overall weak correlation between eocs and the proportion of the catchment with agricultural land use another challenge is airborne transport of pesticides e g clifford et al 2016 unsworth et al 1999 which could result in pesticides in areas with other land uses pcp ls and pharmaceutical compounds can originate from either agricultural or urban sources the correlation results might suggest that the primary sources in croatian karst are urban areas i e wastewater fig 8e and f this is in line with previous findings in a highly karstified aquifer doummar and aoun 2018 zemann et al 2015 however it remains unclear why paracetamol which is mainly intended for human use savides et al 1984 and proven to be a good wastewater indicator godfrey et al 2007 was only detected once in the croatian karst the low detection frequency for paracetamol and the fact that most of the pharmaceuticals detected in this study are intended for both human and veterinary use e g carbamazepine point to the origin of pharmaceuticals in croatian karst groundwater being mainly from agricultural sources the dominance of agricultural land use in study catchments also supports this hypothesis 6 conclusion and future outlook 1 a total of 65 different contaminants were present with 277 detections from 35 samples five compounds were found at concentrations close to or exceeding eu standards and concentrations of some eocs exceeded pnec values indicating that they are likely to be impacting aquatic ecosystems agricultural industrial pharmaceutical and pcp ls compounds were all detected at most sites pharmaceutical and agricultural compounds were detected most frequently whilst the highest concentrations were in industrial and personal care product and lifestyle compound groups of 35 samples only one had no detected eocs 2 eoc compounds were detected frequently and often with high mass fluxes further indicating the vulnerability of the croatian karst tppa with a half life of 3 4 days was present at two sites and could be useful in vulnerability assessments as an indicator of rapid groundwater flow 3 the lower concentrations found in this study compared with other karst groundwater studies may reflect pollutant dillution due to the exceptionally high discharge of the classical karst springs it could also reflect the relatively large proportion of natural land cover present in the studied catchments however due to the high spring discharges the mass fluxes of eoc pollutants were considerable 10 to 106 ng s 4 agriculture appears to be a major source of eoc contamination in the croatian karst with high proportions of agricultural land use and many of the eocs detected are likely to have an agricultural source however the percentage of agricultural land use in the catchment generally had no or only a very weak correlation with the number of detected compounds concentrations this is likely to reflect the large size of the studied catchments the complexity of karst pollution transport and the potential for long range atmospheric transport of pesticides further work at the individual catchment scale is needed to understand the relationship between land use and eocs in the croatian karst which would also provide valuable insights into the transport and attenuation of eocs in karst more generally 5 data from two sampling campaigns show the high variability of eoc contamination in karst springs such changes would be expected in karst where spring discharges and karst conduit flow paths vary substantially on both seasonal and sometimes hourly daily timescales these results highlight the need for future studies focussed on temporal variations in eocs in karst credit authorship contribution statement jasmina lukač reberski conceptualization investigation visualization writing original draft

1888,china has abundant wetland resources however wetland ecosystems are experiencing critical challenges owing to continuous anthropogenic activities and climate change therefore rapid and accurate mapping of wetlands and analysis of the drivers of spatiotemporal changes in wetlands are of great importance for wetland resource conservation in this study we proposed a comprehensive method for wetland mapping in china based on landsat images in which inland wetlands were identified by the object oriented and hierarchical classification method and coastal wetlands were extracted by visual interpretation based on sea boundaries and sea level nodes additionally partial least squares structural equation modelling was utilized to exploit the mechanisms of spatiotemporal variability in wetlands during 2000 2015 the application of the comprehensive method to landsat tm oli resulted in wetland maps of china with overall classification accuracies above 85 the national wetland maps demonstrated that the wetland areas of china in 2000 and 2015 were 476 305 68 and 456 262 01 km2 respectively and swamps accounted for the largest proportion of the total wetland area in china over 38 statistics show that wetlands are mainly located in the northern inland areas such as tibet inner mongolia and xinjiang autonomous region as well as the qinghai and heilongjiang provinces wetland changes were concentrated in the tibetan plateau loess plateau song liao plain and middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river human activities and climate change were the primary contributors to wetland changes in china these two factors can not only directly influence wetland changes but also can be indirectly influenced by other factors such as soil and topography the results of this study are intended to provide basic data for monitoring and conserving wetland resources in china keywords wetland mapping landsat object oriented and hierarchical classification method spatiotemporal change china data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wetlands are one of the most productive ecosystems on earth play an important role in water conservation climate regulation and biodiversity maintenance and are known as the kidneys of the earth bansal et al 2017 cai et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 kovács et al 2022 zhang and lin 2022 reclamation and infrastructure have taken up a large amount of high quality wetland resources and overfishing and invasive alien species have seriously damaged the biodiversity of wetlands in china niu et al 2012 mao et al 2018 long et al 2021 therefore increasing the total amount of wetland resources improving the quality of wetland resources and enhancing their ecological functions are important strategic tasks for the ecological sustainable development and civilization construction in china in the current context of the coexistence of wetland resources and restoration and the continuous promotion of globalized urbanization it is of great importance to develop methods that can rapidly identify extract analyze and evaluate wetland resources in china owing to its large coverage low labor cost and high spatiotemporal resolution remote sensing has become the preferred method for large scale wetland resource monitoring and assessment at large scales mahdavi et al 2018 mahdianpari et al 2018 deventer et al 2019 alonso et al 2020 mao et al 2021a zhang et al 2022a zhou et al 2022 despite these advantages the lack of long time series remote sensing data and the discrepancy between remote sensing inversion results of key hydrological parameters as well as field monitoring have been bottlenecks limiting the existing wetland monitoring analysis at the national or global scale based on remote sensing as a result a number of researchers have tried to incorporate multi year remote sensing data or methods such as sample migration to achieve accurate monitoring of wetlands in china niu et al 2009 employed landsat etm remote sensing images accumulated from 1999 to 2002 as data sources and carried out preliminary wetlands such as water surfaces and marshes nationwide using a manual visual interpretation method gong et al 2010 collected landsat tm and etm images from 1987 to 1992 and from 1999 to 2002 as basic data sources and used visual interpretation to obtain wetland mapping for the base years of 1990 and 2000 in china mao et al 2020 utilized landsat 8 oli remote sensing imagery from 2014 to 2016 and obtained a wetland map of china for 2015 based on an object oriented hierarchical classification method the above studies have identified multiple categories of wetlands in china both primary coastal inland and artificial wetlands and secondary coastal marshes rivers lakes reservoirs and rice paddies in addition numerous studies have been specifically conducted for singular species wetland mapping such as mangroves tidal flats coastal wetlands and water bodies in china based on remote sensing images jia et al 2021 employed sentinel 2 imagery and the otsu algorithm based on the google earth engine gee to map tidal flats in china zhang et al 2022 mapped mangroves in china during 2016 2020 using sentinel 2 images by integrating the obia and otsu algorithms based on gee wang et al 2022 identified coastal aquaculture ponds in china using non iterative clustering with a hierarchical decision tree method based on sentinel 2 data compared to singular wetland mapping it is much more difficult to classify wetland categories owing to the non zonal distribution and complex and variable ecological environments of wetlands nevertheless wetland maps with detailed categories appear to be more important when performing spatiotemporal changes in wetlands and their effects on carbon stocks greenhouse gas emissions and ecological service values mao et al 2021b comprehensive consideration of data history accessibility coverage and spatial resolution makes landsat data the optimal source for long term time series and large scale wetland mapping and its change analysis gong et al 2010 jin et al 2017 chen et al 2022 regarding wetland classification methods wetlands have non zonal distribution characteristics and the derivation of wetland information in the target area requires layers of refinement the hierarchical classification method avoids hidden operations reduces uncertainty and provides more flexibility in the application of wetland information extraction for large regions dronova et al 2012 zhang et al 2022b additionally determining the boundaries of coastal wetlands has been a challenge owing to tidal influence yang et al 2022 because of the large spatial differences in natural endowments and socioeconomic development in china their impacts on wetland changes are also characterized by substantial spatial and temporal differences gong et al 2016 mao et al 2018 the spatiotemporal dynamic evolution characteristics and patterns of wetland distribution can be analyzed using quantitative indicators to better protect wetland resources currently chinese scholars have attempted to analyze the spatiotemporal changes in wetlands in china and their driving mechanisms unfortunately the predominant sources of wetland datasets include early wetland field survey data national scale wetland data obtained based on remote sensing visual interpretation and global or national land use data these datasets are either old or not up to date or the wetland types are rough and singular for example niu et al 2012 gong et al 2016 and mao et al 2018 used wetland distribution data from china before 2010 land cover data from the chinese academy of sciences and ministry of ecology and environment have only marshes lakes reservoirs and rivers xu et al 2019 and the globeland 30 and clcd datasets have wetlands and water chen et al 2014 jia et al 2019 ren et al 2019 and chen et al 2020 studied the spatiotemporal variation of singular wetlands such as mangrove forests coastal aquaculture ponds and spartina alterniflora in china respectively obviously these datasets are not adequate for studying the spatiotemporal evolution of wetlands and their influencing factors for the analysis of national scale wetland change driving mechanisms most studies have mainly utilized qualitative analysis and lack quantitative calculations of driving factors gong et al 2010 niu et al 2012 xu et al 2019 additionally few studies have explored the drivers of wetland change in china using methods such as geographically weighted regression gong et al 2016 however the causes of wetland change are not only the driving factors but also the correlations between different factors that can affect wetland change therefore there is an urgent need to construct more applicable models for analysis of the drivers of large scale wetland changes consequently the primary objective of this study was to generate wetland maps with detailed categories based on landsat imagery at a national scale for the analysis of the spatial and temporal evolution of wetlands in china the novelty and main gaps addressed in this paper are 1 facing the possible problems in national scale wetland classification using medium resolution images this study proposes an accurate and comprehensive wetland classification method considering image spectral texture shape and spatial information as well as sea level nodes and 2 the spatiotemporal changes of wetlands in china from 2000 to 2015 and the driving regimes were thoroughly characterized this study provides social support for wetland mapping and updating wetland data in china while providing a scientific foundation for wetland resource management and conservation 2 data and preprocessing 2 1 date for wetland classification in china landsat tm 2000 and oli 2015 images were downloaded from the united states geological survey https www usgs gov and geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn in this study remote sensing images of the abundant water period june july and august were selected as the main data source for wetland interpretation and images of the same period in the neighboring years were selected instead of missing or high cloudiness images finally a total of 204 scenes of tm images in 2000 covering the land area of china were available supplemented by other 391 scenes of images in 1999 2001 and 2002 a total of 525 scenes of oli images in 2015 were selected and additional 101 scenes of data 2013 2014 and 2016 2017 are

and the instrumented bands are 1 7 bands all with a spatial resolution of 30 m envi 5 3 and arcgis 10 2 image processing software were used to perform pre processing work such as radiometric calibration atmospheric correction projection conversion stitching and cropping all landsat images were uniformly converted to albers projection and wgs84 coordinate systems other associated auxiliary

indicators of the volume of change in temperature precipitation evapotranspiration sediment clay organic carbon oc ph elevation slope gross domestic product gdp population and cropland in china were selected as manifest variables in this study table 1 and climate change temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration soil change sediment clay oc and ph topography change elevation and slope and human activity change gdp population and cropland as latent variables soil properties have been less frequently introduced in previous studies of wetland evolutionary driving mechanisms however in this study the soil factor was employed wetland soils are an important component of wetland ecosystems act as the initial site of chemical acquisition and mediator of biogeochemical cycles in wetlands moreover they are important drivers of wetland ecosystem evolution wang et al 2022 climate partial soil 1995 and human activity data gdp and population were downloaded from the resource and environmental science and data center of the chinese academy of sciences https www resdc cn soil data in 2010 were downloaded from hamonized world soil database the dem data were downloaded from united states geological survey https www usgs gov the cropland classification results based on landsat in this study were used as cropland data the administrative regions of china were divided into 20 km 20 km grids and the average value of each grid for the variables was considered as the sample set 3 methods 3 1 classification of wetlands in china using a comprehensive method 3 1 1 establishment of the wetland classification system according to the national wetland resources survey and monitoring technical regulations trial and the second national wetland resources data the national wetland ecosystem in this study was divided into natural and artificial wetlands table 2 mainly including five wetland types coastal wetland rivers lakes swamps and artificial wetland excluding paddy fields 3 1 2 object oriented and hierarchical classification of inland wetlands in china 1 image segmentation the multi scale segmentation algorithm in the ecognition developer 9 2 platform was applied to segment the prepared landsat dataset including spectral bands spectral indices and dem the multiscale segmentation algorithm segments an image by setting the band weight segmentation scale shape factor and tightness to obtain a number of objects composed of the same feature elements shen et al 2019 the size of the segmentation scale value should be determined by the complexity of the landscape with a larger scale value for areas of homogeneity and a smaller scale value for areas of high heterogeneity owing to the widely varying landscapes in china no precise method is available for determining the optimal segmentation scale for images therefore we combined experience with practical trials to select an appropriate optimal segmentation scale under different landscape conditions according to the topography characteristics of china the shape factor and tightness were set to 0 25 and 0 5 respectively the spectral difference segmentation algorithm in the ecognition developer 9 2 platform was also applied to merge fragmented spots with similar spectral features to maintain the integrity of the target features and the maximum spectral difference was set to vary from 30 to 80 when combining both segmentation algorithms the features maintain better integrity and exclude the interfering nature of rivers with shapes similar to reservoirs and lakes fig 2 2 feature selection and classification rule construction once image segmentation was completed the spectral shape texture and spatial features of the data were calculated and classification rules were established according to the classification and regression tree cart method owing to the large regional scale and different wetland categories the image feature variables for classification were repeatedly tested on an empirical basis to obtain the optimal feature variables therefore spectral bands and indices and landscape and texture features were included in the design of the classification rules table 3 in this study by calculating the separability of feature variables among training samples it was demonstrated that the separability between land classes was the greatest when using the modified normalized water index mndwi normalized difference vegetation index ndvi shape index area rectangular fit length width gray level co occurrence matrix glcm homogeneity and relations to neighboring objects finally a decision tree model for wetland classification was constructed fig 3 to verify the accuracy of the object oriented cart decision tree method the random forest full convolutional neural network u net and object oriented nearest neighbor methods were simultaneously used to classify the images the results indicated that the object oriented cart decision tree had the best classification performance with few missed scores and a more complete river extraction fig 4 the hierarchical classification method extracts target features in a detailed and step by step manner according to the non zonal distribution characteristics of wetlands which can reduce misclassifications and mix ups 3 sample dataset for wetland classification and validation a stratified sampling method was used to randomly generate samples in arcgis software the shp files of the manual visual interpretation results were separately exported as constraint boundaries for different feature types to assist google earth images in generating samples and the sample points falling on the mixed image pixels were adjusted in addition we verified the accuracy of the samples through field surveys fig 5 given the small proportion of each wetland type in the overall land use types disproportionate sampling in the stratified sampling method was used to appropriately increase the proportion of the sample number of each wetland type in the total sample to reflect the characteristics of each wetland type in the sample database ultimately a sample database of approximately 26 800 evenly distributed and representative samples was selected approximately 70 of them were used for training and 30 for validation accuracy assessment was performed by generating confusion matrices and the evaluation metrics included the producer accuracy pa user accuracy ua overall accuracy and kappa coefficient 3 1 3 visual interpretation of coastal wetlands in china coastal wetlands mainly contain offshore and shoreline wetlands the coastal wetland types are difficult to be solely withdrawn by using remote sensing technology because of problems such as limitation of technical means and shortage of open basic information such as historical tide and tide level information and dem in each coastal city therefore in this study coastal wetlands were separately identified by visual interpretation fig 6 b and low tide lines were buffered by referring to the sea boundaries and sea level nodes fig 6a published by the administrative divisions of provinces and municipalities and marine administrations of china 3 2 pls sem model for wetland change driving mechanisms partial least square structural equation modeling pls sem was applied to discuss the drivers of wetland change in china in this study because the advantage of pls sem is to fully exploit the information of the data to minimize the error term moreover it does not require a large sample size model identification problem or distribution state of the data thus it can effectively deal with the covariance problem between variables wang et al 2022 the pls sem model consists of two main components a measurement model that describes the relationship between latent and manifest variables and a structural model that describes the relationship between latent and latent variables the parameter estimation method of the model was divided into two steps 1 the estimates of the latent variables were obtained through iterations and 2 linear regression using partial least squares was performed to obtain the parameter estimates of the structural and measurement models if there are k latent variables there are k groups of manifest variables each group contains m variables and each group of manifest variables can be expressed as 1 x i x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 x im i 1 2 3 k it is assumed that the latent variables are all linearly combined with the latent variables and the latent variables with the manifest variables each manifest variable is associated with a unique latent variable and the equation of the measurement model is 2 x ij λ ij ξ i σ ij i 1 2 3 k j 1 2 3 m i the equation of the structural model is 3 ξ i i j β ij ξ j ε i where ξi is the standardized latent variable λij is the factor loading βij is the path coefficient σij and εi are the error correction terms with a mean value of 0 and are uncorrelated with the predictor 4 results and analysis 4 1 wetland maps of china in 2000 and 2015 4 1 1 wetland classification accuracy the overall accuracies of the wetland classification results in 2000 and 2015 were 85 67 and 87 83 respectively table 4 as the quality of tm images e g radiometric resolution is inferior to that of oli images the accuracy of the chinese wetland classification results in 2000 was somewhat lower than that in 2015 the ua and pa of artificial wetlands rivers and coastal wetlands were relatively stable all of which exceeded 85 however the uas of river wetlands were relatively modest in 2000 and 2015 at 76 73 and 77 42 respectively in some regions especially in arid northwest china images were missing or of poor quality during periods of abundant water and it was difficult to obtain rivers in addition in areas with high urbanization rates and obvious human activities fine rivers were easily confused with buildings roads and the construction of various bridges over water made it difficult to withdraw the river in its entirety the ua and pa of the swamps were below 85 the spectral characteristics of the mixed image elements of the swampy wetland and vegetation adjacent to each other were similar and several misclassifications and omissions were present 4 1 2 area and distribution of wetlands in china the results of wetland classification mapping in china for the base years of 2000 and 2015 are shown in fig 7 a and b the total wetland areas for both years were 476 305 68 and 456 262 01 km2 respectively excluding hong kong macau and taiwan in 2000 the area of artificial wetland rivers lakes swamps and coastal wetland were 54 179 05 97 761 80 84 066 82 184 144 66 and 56 153 36 km2 respectively fig 7c the areas of the above five wetland types in 2015 were 45 814 96 90 901 68 85 311 80 178 052 21 and 56 181 36 km2 respectively fig 7d the results indicate that swamps accounted for the largest proportion of the total wetland area in china 38 66 and 39 02 in 2000 and 2015 respectively in contrast artificial wetlands accounted for the smallest proportion of total wetland area 11 37 and 10 04 in 2000 and 2015 respectively the rivers were unevenly distributed across the regions mostly in the eastern and southern outflow regions the lakes were widely dispersed mostly in the qinghai tibet plateau the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and the yellow river in china as influenced by the natural environment geographical location climate and other factors marsh wetlands were characterized by their extensive and uneven nature coastal wetlands were mainly distributed along the chinese coastline and were affected by anthropogenic factors such as human reclamation and urban expansion whereas natural factors such as tides seawater and waves maintained their distinct dynamic behavior to further investigate the spatial distribution of wetlands in china wetland areas were calculated by partitioning the provinces watersheds precipitation and elevation statistics showed that the wetlands in china are mainly located in the northern inland areas such as tibet inner mongolia and the xinjiang autonomous region as well as the qinghai and heilongjiang provinces the wetlands in these five areas accounted for 50 of the entire wetland area in china fig 8 a artificial wetlands were mainly distributed in guangdong shandong and hubei provinces the contributing wetland types included a large number of aquaculture farms irrigation ditches reservoirs and ponds the distribution of rivers lakes and marshes was moderately similar to that of the total wetland area mainly concentrated in the provinces of qinghai heilongjiang inner mongolia tibet and qinghai coastal wetlands were mainly discovered in jiangsu province followed by zhejiang guangdong and liaoning provinces watersheds are important scales for describing wetland research because they cover the scope of a river and its tributaries the comparison demonstrated that the inland river areas song liao basin and yangtze river basin were the main zones of wetland distribution in china accounting for approximately 70 of the total wetland area the main wetland types in the three regions were swamps lakes and rivers fig 8b climate is an important factor in the existence of wetlands because it determines temperature and precipitation chinese wetlands were mainly distributed in the temperate monsoon climate zone highland climate zone and subtropical monsoon climate zone accounting for 35 32 and 22 of the total wetland area respectively fig 8c elevation has a substantial influence on wetland distribution as shown in fig 8d chinese wetlands are primarily located in regions below 500 m 47 and the main types of wetlands are coastal wetlands swamps and rivers conversely the proportion of wetlands distributed in the elevation range of 500 1000 m is the lowest accounting for less than 10 of the total wetland area in china no artificial wetlands were detected in regions with altitudes above 3000 m owing to altitude and climate these zones are not suitable for human habitation 4 2 spatial and temporal changes in wetlands from 2000 to 2015 wetland expansion was concentrated in the tibetan plateau loess plateau middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and pearl river basin fig 9 the total area converted from other ecosystems to wetlands between 2000 and 2015 was 93 756 32 km2 the percentages of conversion to wetland types were as follows 34 94 for rivers 34 89 for swamps 16 59 for artificial wetland 9 11 for lakes and 4 44 for coastal wetlands the main land types for wetland expansion were croplands 34 6 grasslands 25 8 and forests 8 9 fig 10 the shrinkage of wetlands was mainly in the song liao plain qinghai tibet plateau and middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river a total of 105 962 03 km2 of wetlands were converted to other ecosystems with 48 5 to cropland 14 8 to grassland and 14 2 to buildings of the lost wetlands 38 26 were from swamps 31 49 from rivers 20 8 from artificial wetlands and 9 1 from lakes 4 3 driving mechanisms of wetland change in china the relationships between latent and manifest variables on wetland change from 2000 to 2015 by pls sem model are shown in fig 11 the results demonstrated that human activity climate terrain and soil changes all had negative effects on wetland change with path coefficients of 0 358 0 267 0 107 and 0 113 respectively additionally human activity change and climate change had indirect and negative effects on wetland change through their effect on terrain change in general changes in human activity and climate are the primary factors leading to changes in wetlands in china the main factors driving wetland changes obtained in this study were comparable to the results of other wetland studies gong et al 2016 mao et al 2018 the direct impact of human activities on wetlands occurs through agricultural reclamation mainly through drainage to directly exploit the occupied wetlands in addition wetlands are degraded through increased irrigation and loss of water supply to wetlands cropland in china has continued to decrease since the 1980 s mao et al 2018 however the proportion of paddy fields in the composition of cropland has rapidly increased causing an increase in the demand for water resources in a water balance the water resources supplied to wetlands will also decrease resulting in the degradation and shrinkage of wetlands the degradation and shrinkage of wetlands caused by the reclamation of a large number of wetlands for cropland or agricultural irrigation and the conversion to paddy fields competing for the supply of water to wetlands are the main reasons for the decrease in wetland area for example since 2000 in heilongjiang province the area of paddy fields has continued to increase and from the changes in wetlands in that period it is also the period with the largest decrease in wetland area fig 12 f furthermore since its reform and opening up in 1978 china has experienced a rapid and large scale urbanization process that has not been experienced in human history under the strong support of national policies in urban areas where there is a serious spatial imbalance between land supply and demand wetlands have become one of the priority land types to be filled occupied or transformed and urbanization has become one of the main reasons for the decrease in wetland area fig 12c d and e 5 discussion 5 1 the value of the proposed method for wetland classification and its applicability to other regions this study integrated object oriented hierarchical classification and visual interpretation methods for mapping wetlands in china at 30 m spatial resolution ensuring both high classification accuracy and obtaining detailed wetland types the wetland mapping results refer to the national wetland resources survey and monitoring technical regulations trial and the second national wetland resource data which are in line with wetland resource management and sustainable ecological environment assessment in china our estimated total wetland areas in china differ in certain ways from those in other studies and the national wetland resource survey results the wetland mapping results for 2000 in this study were higher than those of niu et al 2009 gong et al 2010 mao et al 2018 xu et al 2019 and the national wetland resource investigation table 5 this observation may be mainly attributed to the season of remote sensing image selection establishment of wetland classification systems and different methods of wetland classification for example niu et al 2009 and gong et al 2010 selected tm etm and cbers images from may to october and used both manual visual interpretation and pixel based methods for wetland classification the national wetland resource investigation involves mapping of wetland patches over eight hectares in size using field surveys combined with visual interpretation other studies have used remote sensing imagery available throughout the year such as tm etm and hj and the extraction of wetland information has not been sufficiently complete mao et al 2018 xu et al 2019 however the remote sensing data selected for this study were landsat images during the period of abundant water june august and the wetland area obtained in this case was larger than that obtained using remote sensing imagery throughout the year meanwhile the object oriented hierarchical classification method adopted in this study can reduce the salt and pepper content and further increase the area of wetlands in the classification results compared with that obtained with the image pixel based classification method concerning the results in 2015 the wetland area of china obtained in this study is comparable to the results of mao et al 2020 because of the similarity of the remote sensing images and classification methods used in addition we obtained coastal wetlands by combining sea level nodes and landsat images by visual interpretation fig 6 which is distinct from other studies although the method and results of in this paper differ from other similar studies for wetland identification in china the method proposed in this paper has a wider range of applicability especially for countries with abundant coastal wetland resources wetlands are greatly influenced by precipitation and hydrological conditions which leads to the importance of remote sensing image selection when identifying wetlands in this paper the remote sensing images of the abundant water period were selected as the base images for the classification of inland wetlands in china avoiding the error of wetland area due to the difference of image selection furthermore coastal wetlands are more complexly affected by hydrological conditions such as estuarine discharge sand discharge and tides therefore the coastal wetlands in china cannot be accurately identified by using object oriented hierarchical classification methods based on single period remote sensing images this study formed the boundaries of china s land and sea using the sea area boundaries and sea area nodes buffered by the administrative divisions of provinces and municipalities and published by marine administrations in order to accurately map the wetland types associated with coastal wetlands the accuracy of this paper on the identification of coastal wetlands in china is higher compared to other similar studies with 87 01 pa 85 62 ua and 87 66 pa 84 38 ua accuracy of coastal wetlands in china in 2000 and 2015 respectively the wetland classification method developed in this paper provides new insights into the identification of wetlands for countries with rich coastal wetland resources 5 2 factors affecting wetland changes in china concerning the driving mechanisms of the spatiotemporal evolution of wetlands we synthesized climatic soil socioeconomic and terrain factors and explored the drivers of wetland evolution in china from 2000 to 2015 using the pls sem model compared to other analogous studies the proposed study adopts a quantitative perspective and considers more factors for example gong et al 2010 and xu et al 2019 utilized qualitative approaches to briefly describe the driving forces such as anthropogenic activities climate and wetland conservation policy of spatiotemporal changes in wetlands in china mao et al 2018 explored the loss of wetlands owing to urbanization based on spatial overlay analysis of land use cover data although gong 2016 quantified the driving mechanisms of wetland changes in china from 1978 to 2008 using the gwr approach the driving factors considered were limited to those related to climate and human activities however the driving mechanism of the spatiotemporal evolution of wetlands is a consequence of the combined action of multiple factors and the selection of drivers and methods should be in accordance with the characteristics of wetland changes additionally wetland is a very sensitive ecosystem and the factors that lead to changes in them are very diverse therefore more factors should be taken into consideration when exploring the driving mechanisms of wetland changes such as water pollution natural hazards geological activities biological activities etc in particular china s wetland resources are abundant diverse and differ markedly in regional distribution and the reasons for the changes in wetlands vary from region to region both of these are needed to be considered in subsequent studies on the driving mechanisms of wetland change in china 5 3 limitations and uncertainty although detailed wetland mapping results for 2000 and 2015 in china were delineated using landsat tm oli images and the spatiotemporal evolution and driving mechanisms of wetlands in china were explored this study has some uncertainties and limitations in terms of satellite imagery the absence or poor quality of landsat images particularly in the arid northwest during periods of abundant water can impose difficulties in seasonal wetland identification fig 13 a furthermore some limitations are present in the display of wetland types in remote sensing images such as natural lake boundaries after artificial restoration fig 13b which have obvious boundaries and are easily classified as artificial wetlands reservoirs and ponds in addition in areas with high urbanization rates and obvious human activities fine rivers are easily confused with buildings roads and the construction of various bridges over water makes it difficult to identify the river in its entirety fig 13c regarding wetland classification methods although the object oriented hierarchical classification method has strong practicality the number of different features is large at a national scale and the morphological characteristics of the same feature are different therefore the optimal segmentation scale needs to be determined after repeated attempts meanwhile as a result of the segmentation focusing on the effectiveness of each wetland type it is easy to form mixed image elements between vegetation and adjacent features such as buildings resulting in misclassification moreover medium resolution images can easily form mixed elements and the accuracy of partial wetland type identification is still unsatisfactory especially swamps in the follow up study we propose to use higher resolution multispectral remote sensing images e g sentinel 2 gf 6 to solve the image spatial resolution problem in addition the spatio temporal fusion model appeared to be a feasible approach for the missing remote sensing images as for wetland changes interconversion between wetlands involves uncertainties in the remote sensing interpretation of wetland types and changes in wetland types because of annual changes in precipitation owing to the absence of images this study used data from similar years or months instead which would contribute to errors in the remote sensing interpretation of wetlands and wetland change analysis for instances swamps may be considered as lake or river during periods of flooding and conversely lakes rivers may be considered as swamps during periods of drought in conclusion the seasonal interconversion between inland wetland types is substantial creating a large degree of uncertainty in monitoring interannual wetland changes many drivers of wetland change in china are involved unfortunately many of them are not available or rasterized which could introduce some uncertainty in the analysis of the drivers of wetland change a more comprehensive exploration of the mechanisms driving wetland change is underway as we are collecting and actively applying to the government for additional data sets e g hydrology faunal activity geological hazards that affect wetland change 6 conclusions wetland maps of china in 2000 and 2015 were obtained using comprehensive object oriented hierarchical classification and visual interpretation methods based on landsat tm oli images the wetland areas in china were estimated to be 476 305 68 and 456 262 01 km2 in 2000 and 2015 with swamps accounting for the largest proportion 38 and artificial wetlands accounting for the smallest proportion less than12 of the total wetland area chinese wetlands are mainly observed in inland geographical regions such as heilongjiang tibet and inner mongolia wetland transfers in china were carried out in the tibetan plateau loess plateau song liao plain and the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river anthropogenic activity and climate change remain crucial challenges for wetland

1888,china has abundant wetland resources however wetland ecosystems are experiencing critical challenges owing to continuous anthropogenic activities and climate change therefore rapid and accurate mapping of wetlands and analysis of the drivers of spatiotemporal changes in wetlands are of great importance for wetland resource conservation in this study we proposed a comprehensive method for wetland mapping in china based on landsat images in which inland wetlands were identified by the object oriented and hierarchical classification method and coastal wetlands were extracted by visual interpretation based on sea boundaries and sea level nodes additionally partial least squares structural equation modelling was utilized to exploit the mechanisms of spatiotemporal variability in wetlands during 2000 2015 the application of the comprehensive method to landsat tm oli resulted in wetland maps of china with overall classification accuracies above 85 the national wetland maps demonstrated that the wetland areas of china in 2000 and 2015 were 476 305 68 and 456 262 01 km2 respectively and swamps accounted for the largest proportion of the total wetland area in china over 38 statistics show that wetlands are mainly located in the northern inland areas such as tibet inner mongolia and xinjiang autonomous region as well as the qinghai and heilongjiang provinces wetland changes were concentrated in the tibetan plateau loess plateau song liao plain and middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river human activities and climate change were the primary contributors to wetland changes in china these two factors can not only directly influence wetland changes but also can be indirectly influenced by other factors such as soil and topography the results of this study are intended to provide basic data for monitoring and conserving wetland resources in china keywords wetland mapping landsat object oriented and hierarchical classification method spatiotemporal change china data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wetlands are one of the most productive ecosystems on earth play an important role in water conservation climate regulation and biodiversity maintenance and are known as the kidneys of the earth bansal et al 2017 cai et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 kovács et al 2022 zhang and lin 2022 reclamation and infrastructure have taken up a large amount of high quality wetland resources and overfishing and invasive alien species have seriously damaged the biodiversity of wetlands in china niu et al 2012 mao et al 2018 long et al 2021 therefore increasing the total amount of wetland resources improving the quality of wetland resources and enhancing their ecological functions are important strategic tasks for the ecological sustainable development and civilization construction in china in the current context of the coexistence of wetland resources and restoration and the continuous promotion of globalized urbanization it is of great importance to develop methods that can rapidly identify extract analyze and evaluate wetland resources in china owing to its large coverage low labor cost and high spatiotemporal resolution remote sensing has become the preferred method for large scale wetland resource monitoring and assessment at large scales mahdavi et al 2018 mahdianpari et al 2018 deventer et al 2019 alonso et al 2020 mao et al 2021a zhang et al 2022a zhou et al 2022 despite these advantages the lack of long time series remote sensing data and the discrepancy between remote sensing inversion results of key hydrological parameters as well as field monitoring have been bottlenecks limiting the existing wetland monitoring analysis at the national or global scale based on remote sensing as a result a number of researchers have tried to incorporate multi year remote sensing data or methods such as sample migration to achieve accurate monitoring of wetlands in china niu et al 2009 employed landsat etm remote sensing images accumulated from 1999 to 2002 as data sources and carried out preliminary wetlands such as water surfaces and marshes nationwide using a manual visual interpretation method gong et al 2010 collected landsat tm and etm images from 1987 to 1992 and from 1999 to 2002 as basic data sources and used visual interpretation to obtain wetland mapping for the base years of 1990 and 2000 in china mao et al 2020 utilized landsat 8 oli remote sensing imagery from 2014 to 2016 and obtained a wetland map of china for 2015 based on an object oriented hierarchical classification method the above studies have identified multiple categories of wetlands in china both primary coastal inland and artificial wetlands and secondary coastal marshes rivers lakes reservoirs and rice paddies in addition numerous studies have been specifically conducted for singular species wetland mapping such as mangroves tidal flats coastal wetlands and water bodies in china based on remote sensing images jia et al 2021 employed sentinel 2 imagery and the otsu algorithm based on the google earth engine gee to map tidal flats in china zhang et al 2022 mapped mangroves in china during 2016 2020 using sentinel 2 images by integrating the obia and otsu algorithms based on gee wang et al 2022 identified coastal aquaculture ponds in china using non iterative clustering with a hierarchical decision tree method based on sentinel 2 data compared to singular wetland mapping it is much more difficult to classify wetland categories owing to the non zonal distribution and complex and variable ecological environments of wetlands nevertheless wetland maps with detailed categories appear to be more important when performing spatiotemporal changes in wetlands and their effects on carbon stocks greenhouse gas emissions and ecological service values mao et al 2021b comprehensive consideration of data history accessibility coverage and spatial resolution makes landsat data the optimal source for long term time series and large scale wetland mapping and its change analysis gong et al 2010 jin et al 2017 chen et al 2022 regarding wetland classification methods wetlands have non zonal distribution characteristics and the derivation of wetland information in the target area requires layers of refinement the hierarchical classification method avoids hidden operations reduces uncertainty and provides more flexibility in the application of wetland information extraction for large regions dronova et al 2012 zhang et al 2022b additionally determining the boundaries of coastal wetlands has been a challenge owing to tidal influence yang et al 2022 because of the large spatial differences in natural endowments and socioeconomic development in china their impacts on wetland changes are also characterized by substantial spatial and temporal differences gong et al 2016 mao et al 2018 the spatiotemporal dynamic evolution characteristics and patterns of wetland distribution can be analyzed using quantitative indicators to better protect wetland resources currently chinese scholars have attempted to analyze the spatiotemporal changes in wetlands in china and their driving mechanisms unfortunately the predominant sources of wetland datasets include early wetland field survey data national scale wetland data obtained based on remote sensing visual interpretation and global or national land use data these datasets are either old or not up to date or the wetland types are rough and singular for example niu et al 2012 gong et al 2016 and mao et al 2018 used wetland distribution data from china before 2010 land cover data from the chinese academy of sciences and ministry of ecology and environment have only marshes lakes reservoirs and rivers xu et al 2019 and the globeland 30 and clcd datasets have wetlands and water chen et al 2014 jia et al 2019 ren et al 2019 and chen et al 2020 studied the spatiotemporal variation of singular wetlands such as mangrove forests coastal aquaculture ponds and spartina alterniflora in china respectively obviously these datasets are not adequate for studying the spatiotemporal evolution of wetlands and their influencing factors for the analysis of national scale wetland change driving mechanisms most studies have mainly utilized qualitative analysis and lack quantitative calculations of driving factors gong et al 2010 niu et al 2012 xu et al 2019 additionally few studies have explored the drivers of wetland change in china using methods such as geographically weighted regression gong et al 2016 however the causes of wetland change are not only the driving factors but also the correlations between different factors that can affect wetland change therefore there is an urgent need to construct more applicable models for analysis of the drivers of large scale wetland changes consequently the primary objective of this study was to generate wetland maps with detailed categories based on landsat imagery at a national scale for the analysis of the spatial and temporal evolution of wetlands in china the novelty and main gaps addressed in this paper are 1 facing the possible problems in national scale wetland classification using medium resolution images this study proposes an accurate and comprehensive wetland classification method considering image spectral texture shape and spatial information as well as sea level nodes and 2 the spatiotemporal changes of wetlands in china from 2000 to 2015 and the driving regimes were thoroughly characterized this study provides social support for wetland mapping and updating wetland data in china while providing a scientific foundation for wetland resource management and conservation 2 data and preprocessing 2 1 date for wetland classification in china landsat tm 2000 and oli 2015 images were downloaded from the united states geological survey https www usgs gov and geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn in this study remote sensing images of the abundant water period june july and august were selected as the main data source for wetland interpretation and images of the same period in the neighboring years were selected instead of missing or high cloudiness images finally a total of 204 scenes of tm images in 2000 covering the land area of china were available supplemented by other 391 scenes of images in 1999 2001 and 2002 a total of 525 scenes of oli images in 2015 were selected and additional 101 scenes of data 2013 2014 and 2016 2017 are

indicators of the volume of change in temperature precipitation evapotranspiration sediment clay organic carbon oc ph elevation slope gross domestic product gdp population and cropland in china were selected as manifest variables in this study table 1 and climate change temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration soil change sediment clay oc and ph topography change elevation and slope and human activity change gdp population and cropland as latent variables soil properties have been less frequently introduced in previous studies of wetland evolutionary driving mechanisms however in this study the soil factor was employed wetland soils are an important component of wetland ecosystems act as the initial site of chemical acquisition and mediator of biogeochemical cycles in wetlands moreover they are important drivers of wetland ecosystem evolution wang et al 2022 climate partial soil 1995 and human activity data gdp and population were downloaded from the resource and environmental science and data center of the chinese academy of sciences https www resdc cn soil data in 2010 were downloaded from hamonized world soil database the dem data were downloaded from united states geological survey https www usgs gov the cropland classification results based on landsat in this study were used as cropland data the administrative regions of china were divided into 20 km 20 km grids and the average value of each grid for the variables was considered as the sample set 3 methods 3 1 classification of wetlands in china using a comprehensive method 3 1 1 establishment of the wetland classification system according to the national wetland resources survey and monitoring technical regulations trial and the second national wetland resources data the national wetland ecosystem in this study was divided into natural and artificial wetlands table 2 mainly including five wetland types coastal wetland rivers lakes swamps and artificial wetland excluding paddy fields 3 1 2 object oriented and hierarchical classification of inland wetlands in china 1 image segmentation the multi scale segmentation algorithm in the ecognition developer 9 2 platform was applied to segment the prepared landsat dataset including spectral bands spectral indices and dem the multiscale segmentation algorithm segments an image by setting the band weight segmentation scale shape factor and tightness to obtain a number of objects composed of the same feature elements shen et al 2019 the size of the segmentation scale value should be determined by the complexity of the landscape with a larger scale value for areas of homogeneity and a smaller scale value for areas of high heterogeneity owing to the widely varying landscapes in china no precise method is available for determining the optimal segmentation scale for images therefore we combined experience with practical trials to select an appropriate optimal segmentation scale under different landscape conditions according to the topography characteristics of china the shape factor and tightness were set to 0 25 and 0 5 respectively the spectral difference segmentation algorithm in the ecognition developer 9 2 platform was also applied to merge fragmented spots with similar spectral features to maintain the integrity of the target features and the maximum spectral difference was set to vary from 30 to 80 when combining both segmentation algorithms the features maintain better integrity and exclude the interfering nature of rivers with shapes similar to reservoirs and lakes fig 2 2 feature selection and classification rule construction once image segmentation was completed the spectral shape texture and spatial features of the data were calculated and classification rules were established according to the classification and regression tree cart method owing to the large regional scale and different wetland categories the image feature variables for classification were repeatedly tested on an empirical basis to obtain the optimal feature variables therefore spectral bands and indices and landscape and texture features were included in the design of the classification rules table 3 in this study by calculating the separability of feature variables among training samples it was demonstrated that the separability between land classes was the greatest when using the modified normalized water index mndwi normalized difference vegetation index ndvi shape index area rectangular fit length width gray level co occurrence matrix glcm homogeneity and relations to neighboring objects finally a decision tree model for wetland classification was constructed fig 3 to verify the accuracy of the object oriented cart decision tree method the random forest full convolutional neural network u net and object oriented nearest neighbor methods were simultaneously used to classify the images the results indicated that the object oriented cart decision tree had the best classification performance with few missed scores and a more complete river extraction fig 4 the hierarchical classification method extracts target features in a detailed and step by step manner according to the non zonal distribution characteristics of wetlands which can reduce misclassifications and mix ups 3 sample dataset for wetland classification and validation a stratified sampling method was used to randomly generate samples in arcgis software the shp files of the manual visual interpretation results were separately exported as constraint boundaries for different feature types to assist google earth images in generating samples and the sample points falling on the mixed image pixels were adjusted in addition we verified the accuracy of the samples through field surveys fig 5 given the small proportion of each wetland type in the overall land use types disproportionate sampling in the stratified sampling method was used to appropriately increase the proportion of the sample number of each wetland type in the total sample to reflect the characteristics of each wetland type in the sample database ultimately a sample database of approximately 26 800 evenly distributed and representative samples was selected approximately 70 of them were used for training and 30 for validation accuracy assessment was performed by generating confusion matrices and the evaluation metrics included the producer accuracy pa user accuracy ua overall accuracy and kappa coefficient 3 1 3 visual interpretation of coastal wetlands in china coastal wetlands mainly contain offshore and shoreline wetlands the coastal wetland types are difficult to be solely withdrawn by using remote sensing technology because of problems such as limitation of technical means and shortage of open basic information such as historical tide and tide level information and dem in each coastal city therefore in this study coastal wetlands were separately identified by visual interpretation fig 6 b and low tide lines were buffered by referring to the sea boundaries and sea level nodes fig 6a published by the administrative divisions of provinces and municipalities and marine administrations of china 3 2 pls sem model for wetland change driving mechanisms partial least square structural equation modeling pls sem was applied to discuss the drivers of wetland change in china in this study because the advantage of pls sem is to fully exploit the information of the data to minimize the error term moreover it does not require a large sample size model identification problem or distribution state of the data thus it can effectively deal with the covariance problem between variables wang et al 2022 the pls sem model consists of two main components a measurement model that describes the relationship between latent and manifest variables and a structural model that describes the relationship between latent and latent variables the parameter estimation method of the model was divided into two steps 1 the estimates of the latent variables were obtained through iterations and 2 linear regression using partial least squares was performed to obtain the parameter estimates of the structural and measurement models if there are k latent variables there are k groups of manifest variables each group contains m variables and each group of manifest variables can be expressed as 1 x i x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 x im i 1 2 3 k it is assumed that the latent variables are all linearly combined with the latent variables and the latent variables with the manifest variables each manifest variable is associated with a unique latent variable and the equation of the measurement model is 2 x ij λ ij ξ i σ ij i 1 2 3 k j 1 2 3 m i the equation of the structural model is 3 ξ i i j β ij ξ j ε i where ξi is the standardized latent variable λij is the factor loading βij is the path coefficient σij and εi are the error correction terms with a mean value of 0 and are uncorrelated with the predictor 4 results and analysis 4 1 wetland maps of china in 2000 and 2015 4 1 1 wetland classification accuracy the overall accuracies of the wetland classification results in 2000 and 2015 were 85 67 and 87 83 respectively table 4 as the quality of tm images e g radiometric resolution is inferior to that of oli images the accuracy of the chinese wetland classification results in 2000 was somewhat lower than that in 2015 the ua and pa of artificial wetlands rivers and coastal wetlands were relatively stable all of which exceeded 85 however the uas of river wetlands were relatively modest in 2000 and 2015 at 76 73 and 77 42 respectively in some regions especially in arid northwest china images were missing or of poor quality during periods of abundant water and it was difficult to obtain rivers in addition in areas with high urbanization rates and obvious human activities fine rivers were easily confused with buildings roads and the construction of various bridges over water made it difficult to withdraw the river in its entirety the ua and pa of the swamps were below 85 the spectral characteristics of the mixed image elements of the swampy wetland and vegetation adjacent to each other were similar and several misclassifications and omissions were present 4 1 2 area and distribution of wetlands in china the results of wetland classification mapping in china for the base years of 2000 and 2015 are shown in fig 7 a and b the total wetland areas for both years were 476 305 68 and 456 262 01 km2 respectively excluding hong kong macau and taiwan in 2000 the area of artificial wetland rivers lakes swamps and coastal wetland were 54 179 05 97 761 80 84 066 82 184 144 66 and 56 153 36 km2 respectively fig 7c the areas of the above five wetland types in 2015 were 45 814 96 90 901 68 85 311 80 178 052 21 and 56 181 36 km2 respectively fig 7d the results indicate that swamps accounted for the largest proportion of the total wetland area in china 38 66 and 39 02 in 2000 and 2015 respectively in contrast artificial wetlands accounted for the smallest proportion of total wetland area 11 37 and 10 04 in 2000 and 2015 respectively the rivers were unevenly distributed across the regions mostly in the eastern and southern outflow regions the lakes were widely dispersed mostly in the qinghai tibet plateau the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and the yellow river in china as influenced by the natural environment geographical location climate and other factors marsh wetlands were characterized by their extensive and uneven nature coastal wetlands were mainly distributed along the chinese coastline and were affected by anthropogenic factors such as human reclamation and urban expansion whereas natural factors such as tides seawater and waves maintained their distinct dynamic behavior to further investigate the spatial distribution of wetlands in china wetland areas were calculated by partitioning the provinces watersheds precipitation and elevation statistics showed that the wetlands in china are mainly located in the northern inland areas such as tibet inner mongolia and the xinjiang autonomous region as well as the qinghai and heilongjiang provinces the wetlands in these five areas accounted for 50 of the entire wetland area in china fig 8 a artificial wetlands were mainly distributed in guangdong shandong and hubei provinces the contributing wetland types included a large number of aquaculture farms irrigation ditches reservoirs and ponds the distribution of rivers lakes and marshes was moderately similar to that of the total wetland area mainly concentrated in the provinces of qinghai heilongjiang inner mongolia tibet and qinghai coastal wetlands were mainly discovered in jiangsu province followed by zhejiang guangdong and liaoning provinces watersheds are important scales for describing wetland research because they cover the scope of a river and its tributaries the comparison demonstrated that the inland river areas song liao basin and yangtze river basin were the main zones of wetland distribution in china accounting for approximately 70 of the total wetland area the main wetland types in the three regions were swamps lakes and rivers fig 8b climate is an important factor in the existence of wetlands because it determines temperature and precipitation chinese wetlands were mainly distributed in the temperate monsoon climate zone highland climate zone and subtropical monsoon climate zone accounting for 35 32 and 22 of the total wetland area respectively fig 8c elevation has a substantial influence on wetland distribution as shown in fig 8d chinese wetlands are primarily located in regions below 500 m 47 and the main types of wetlands are coastal wetlands swamps and rivers conversely the proportion of wetlands distributed in the elevation range of 500 1000 m is the lowest accounting for less than 10 of the total wetland area in china no artificial wetlands were detected in regions with altitudes above 3000 m owing to altitude and climate these zones are not suitable for human habitation 4 2 spatial and temporal changes in wetlands from 2000 to 2015 wetland expansion was concentrated in the tibetan plateau loess plateau middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and pearl river basin fig 9 the total area converted from other ecosystems to wetlands between 2000 and 2015 was 93 756 32 km2 the percentages of conversion to wetland types were as follows 34 94 for rivers 34 89 for swamps 16 59 for artificial wetland 9 11 for lakes and 4 44 for coastal wetlands the main land types for wetland expansion were croplands 34 6 grasslands 25 8 and forests 8 9 fig 10 the shrinkage of wetlands was mainly in the song liao plain qinghai tibet plateau and middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river a total of 105 962 03 km2 of wetlands were converted to other ecosystems with 48 5 to cropland 14 8 to grassland and 14 2 to buildings of the lost wetlands 38 26 were from swamps 31 49 from rivers 20 8 from artificial wetlands and 9 1 from lakes 4 3 driving mechanisms of wetland change in china the relationships between latent and manifest variables on wetland change from 2000 to 2015 by pls sem model are shown in fig 11 the results demonstrated that human activity climate terrain and soil changes all had negative effects on wetland change with path coefficients of 0 358 0 267 0 107 and 0 113 respectively additionally human activity change and climate change had indirect and negative effects on wetland change through their effect on terrain change in general changes in human activity and climate are the primary factors leading to changes in wetlands in china the main factors driving wetland changes obtained in this study were comparable to the results of other wetland studies gong et al 2016 mao et al 2018 the direct impact of human activities on wetlands occurs through agricultural reclamation mainly through drainage to directly exploit the occupied wetlands in addition wetlands are degraded through increased irrigation and loss of water supply to wetlands cropland in china has continued to decrease since the 1980 s mao et al 2018 however the proportion of paddy fields in the composition of cropland has rapidly increased causing an increase in the demand for water resources in a water balance the water resources supplied to wetlands will also decrease resulting in the degradation and shrinkage of wetlands the degradation and shrinkage of wetlands caused by the reclamation of a large number of wetlands for cropland or agricultural irrigation and the conversion to paddy fields competing for the supply of water to wetlands are the main reasons for the decrease in wetland area for example since 2000 in heilongjiang province the area of paddy fields has continued to increase and from the changes in wetlands in that period it is also the period with the largest decrease in wetland area fig 12 f furthermore since its reform and opening up in 1978 china has experienced a rapid and large scale urbanization process that has not been experienced in human history under the strong support of national policies in urban areas where there is a serious spatial imbalance between land supply and demand wetlands have become one of the priority land types to be filled occupied or transformed and urbanization has become one of the main reasons for the decrease in wetland area fig 12c d and e 5 discussion 5 1 the value of the proposed method for wetland classification and its applicability to other regions this study integrated object oriented hierarchical classification and visual interpretation methods for mapping wetlands in china at 30 m spatial resolution ensuring both high classification accuracy and obtaining detailed wetland types the wetland mapping results refer to the national wetland resources survey and monitoring technical regulations trial and the second national wetland resource data which are in line with wetland resource management and sustainable ecological environment assessment in china our estimated total wetland areas in china differ in certain ways from those in other studies and the national wetland resource survey results the wetland mapping results for 2000 in this study were higher than those of niu et al 2009 gong et al 2010 mao et al 2018 xu et al 2019 and the national wetland resource investigation table 5 this observation may be mainly attributed to the season of remote sensing image selection establishment of wetland classification systems and different methods of wetland classification for example niu et al 2009 and gong et al 2010 selected tm etm and cbers images from may to october and used both manual visual interpretation and pixel based methods for wetland classification the national wetland resource investigation involves mapping of wetland patches over eight hectares in size using field surveys combined with visual interpretation other studies have used remote sensing imagery available throughout the year such as tm etm and hj and the extraction of wetland information has not been sufficiently complete mao et al 2018 xu et al 2019 however the remote sensing data selected for this study were landsat images during the period of abundant water june august and the wetland area obtained in this case was larger than that obtained using remote sensing imagery throughout the year meanwhile the object oriented hierarchical classification method adopted in this study can reduce the salt and pepper content and further increase the area of wetlands in the classification results compared with that obtained with the image pixel based classification method concerning the results in 2015 the wetland area of china obtained in this study is comparable to the results of mao et al 2020 because of the similarity of the remote sensing images and classification methods used in addition we obtained coastal wetlands by combining sea level nodes and landsat images by visual interpretation fig 6 which is distinct from other studies although the method and results of in this paper differ from other similar studies for wetland identification in china the method proposed in this paper has a wider range of applicability especially for countries with abundant coastal wetland resources wetlands are greatly influenced by precipitation and hydrological conditions which leads to the importance of remote sensing image selection when identifying wetlands in this paper the remote sensing images of the abundant water period were selected as the base images for the classification of inland wetlands in china avoiding the error of wetland area due to the difference of image selection furthermore coastal wetlands are more complexly affected by hydrological conditions such as estuarine discharge sand discharge and tides therefore the coastal wetlands in china cannot be accurately identified by using object oriented hierarchical classification methods based on single period remote sensing images this study formed the boundaries of china s land and sea using the sea area boundaries and sea area nodes buffered by the administrative divisions of provinces and municipalities and published by marine administrations in order to accurately map the wetland types associated with coastal wetlands the accuracy of this paper on the identification of coastal wetlands in china is higher compared to other similar studies with 87 01 pa 85 62 ua and 87 66 pa 84 38 ua accuracy of coastal wetlands in china in 2000 and 2015 respectively the wetland classification method developed in this paper provides new insights into the identification of wetlands for countries with rich coastal wetland resources 5 2 factors affecting wetland changes in china concerning the driving mechanisms of the spatiotemporal evolution of wetlands we synthesized climatic soil socioeconomic and terrain factors and explored the drivers of wetland evolution in china from 2000 to 2015 using the pls sem model compared to other analogous studies the proposed study adopts a quantitative perspective and considers more factors for example gong et al 2010 and xu et al 2019 utilized qualitative approaches to briefly describe the driving forces such as anthropogenic activities climate and wetland conservation policy of spatiotemporal changes in wetlands in china mao et al 2018 explored the loss of wetlands owing to urbanization based on spatial overlay analysis of land use cover data although gong 2016 quantified the driving mechanisms of wetland changes in china from 1978 to 2008 using the gwr approach the driving factors considered were limited to those related to climate and human activities however the driving mechanism of the spatiotemporal evolution of wetlands is a consequence of the combined action of multiple factors and the selection of drivers and methods should be in accordance with the characteristics of wetland changes additionally wetland is a very sensitive ecosystem and the factors that lead to changes in them are very diverse therefore more factors should be taken into consideration when exploring the driving mechanisms of wetland changes such as water pollution natural hazards geological activities biological activities etc in particular china s wetland resources are abundant diverse and differ markedly in regional distribution and the reasons for the changes in wetlands vary from region to region both of these are needed to be considered in subsequent studies on the driving mechanisms of wetland change in china 5 3 limitations and uncertainty although detailed wetland mapping results for 2000 and 2015 in china were delineated using landsat tm oli images and the spatiotemporal evolution and driving mechanisms of wetlands in china were explored this study has some uncertainties and limitations in terms of satellite imagery the absence or poor quality of landsat images particularly in the arid northwest during periods of abundant water can impose difficulties in seasonal wetland identification fig 13 a furthermore some limitations are present in the display of wetland types in remote sensing images such as natural lake boundaries after artificial restoration fig 13b which have obvious boundaries and are easily classified as artificial wetlands reservoirs and ponds in addition in areas with high urbanization rates and obvious human activities fine rivers are easily confused with buildings roads and the construction of various bridges over water makes it difficult to identify the river in its entirety fig 13c regarding wetland classification methods although the object oriented hierarchical classification method has strong practicality the number of different features is large at a national scale and the morphological characteristics of the same feature are different therefore the optimal segmentation scale needs to be determined after repeated attempts meanwhile as a result of the segmentation focusing on the effectiveness of each wetland type it is easy to form mixed image elements between vegetation and adjacent features such as buildings resulting in misclassification moreover medium resolution images can easily form mixed elements and the accuracy of partial wetland type identification is still unsatisfactory especially swamps in the follow up study we propose to use higher resolution multispectral remote sensing images e g sentinel 2 gf 6 to solve the image spatial resolution problem in addition the spatio temporal fusion model appeared to be a feasible approach for the missing remote sensing images as for wetland changes interconversion between wetlands involves uncertainties in the remote sensing interpretation of wetland types and changes in wetland types because of annual changes in precipitation owing to the absence of images this study used data from similar years or months instead which would contribute to errors in the remote sensing interpretation of wetlands and wetland change analysis for instances swamps may be considered as lake or river during periods of flooding and conversely lakes rivers may be considered as swamps during periods of drought in conclusion the seasonal interconversion between inland wetland types is substantial creating a large degree of uncertainty in monitoring interannual wetland changes many drivers of wetland change in china are involved unfortunately many of them are not available or rasterized which could introduce some uncertainty in the analysis of the drivers of wetland change a more comprehensive exploration of the mechanisms driving wetland change is underway as we are collecting and actively applying to the government for additional data sets e g hydrology faunal activity geological hazards that affect wetland change 6 conclusions wetland maps of china in 2000 and 2015 were obtained using comprehensive object oriented hierarchical classification and visual interpretation methods based on landsat tm oli images the wetland areas in china were estimated to be 476 305 68 and 456 262 01 km2 in 2000 and 2015 with swamps accounting for the largest proportion 38 and artificial wetlands accounting for the smallest proportion less than12 of the total wetland area chinese wetlands are mainly observed in inland geographical regions such as heilongjiang tibet and inner mongolia wetland transfers in china were carried out in the tibetan plateau loess plateau song liao plain and the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river anthropogenic activity and climate change remain crucial challenges for wetland

1889,freshwaters are important carbon sources to the atmosphere and are influenced by different sources of organic carbon oc microbial community is a crucial trophic network driving carbon cycling in the aquatic ecosystems yet whether and how their interactions affect carbon cycling and emissions in the reservoir remains unclear here we explored the interactions between phytoplankton and bacteria in reservoirs along a trophic gradient an increase in the trophic state intensified the interaction between phytoplankton and bacteria communities their diversity and niche breadth indexes both decreased such intensification was contributed not only by the input of nutrients triggering an increase in trophic state but also by the bulk input of terrigenous oc shaping the concentrations of co2 and ch4 in the water phase and their air water fluxes along the trophic gradient upon this a conceptual framework was proposed to explain the positive negative feedback of phytoplankton bacterial interactions to carbon emissions projecting the dual regulation of aquatic ecosystems and carbon dynamics along a trophic gradient keywords ch4 air water flux autochthonous organic carbon community assembly co occurrence network data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction freshwaters are sentinels of global warming and also integrators or regulators for climate change serving as important carbon sources to the atmosphere williamson et al 2009 the most recent estimates by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc proposed that annual co2 emission from global freshwaters was 1 5 pg c co2 yr 1 ipcc 2021 freshwaters ch4 annual emission was 159 tgch4 yr 1 within in a range between 117 tgch4 yr 1 and 212 tgch4 yr 1 ipcc 2021 saunois et al 2020 compared with earlier global estimates in the fifth assessment report by ipcc carbon emissions from global freshwaters ipcc 2014 particularly ch4 were believed to be experiencing fast growth over the past decades the contribution of global freshwater carbon emissions is quite disproportionate to their relatively limited scale approximately or even 3 of the earth s continents downing et al 2006 gruca rokosz et al 2020 anthropogenic activities e g water regulations and point or non point pollutions have been considered as the most important drivers to increase the carbon emissions from global freshwaters beaulieu et al 2019 stanley et al 2016 the imbroglio among nutrient enrichment global warming and carbon cycling projects the large potential uncertainties in understanding and accounting for carbon emissions in freshwater systems under increased anthropogenic activities although these water bodies are still categorized as natural sources of co2 and ch4 in ipcc s global biogeochemical cycles elevated riverine co2 and ch4 emissions were reported to be evident in river basins with fast urbanization chen et al 2021 gu et al 2022 patel et al 2022 in particular effluents from wastewater treatment plants were reported to stimulate ch4 emission in receiving rivers alshboul et al 2016 jin et al 2018 eutrophication in lakes or reservoirs mostly induced by anthropogenic nutrient inputs has been widely recognized as the major driver responsible for the elevation of carbon emissions beaulieu et al 2019 decreased co2 emission and elevated ch4 emission were reported in a large number of eutrophic lakes or reservoirs sun et al 2021 xiao et al 2020 because excessive organic carbon oc and nutrients input from anthropogenic activities were the cause of elevated carbon emission from freshwaters the planktonic communities in particular phytoplankton and bacteria as primary producers and decomposers play the fundamental roles that regulate the inputs of oc and nutrients shaping the profile of freshwater carbon emissions cotner and biddanda 2002 solomon et al 2015 the different bioavailability of terrigenous and autochthonous oc in freshwater would structure the community of heterotrophic bacteria affecting the production of co2 and ch4 guillemette et al 2013 for example terrigenous oc is believed to with lower reactivity but supports longer term production of ch4 than autochthonous oc grasset et al 2018 grasset et al 2021 bacteria can obtain large amounts of autochthonous organic matter om directly from phytoplankton with up to 50 of the carbon fixed by phytoplankton eventually consumed by bacteria fuhrman and azam 1982 inputs of nitrogen n and phosphorus p could evidently stimulate the growth of primary producers yet the bacteria community could also help the development of the phytoplankton community through mineralization and turnover of inorganic nutrients on a simple level the relationship between these microorganisms is based on the provision of resources and can be mutualism or competition in essence at a community level mutualism based on the provision of resources is the most identifiable relationship between phytoplankton and bacteria communities in the water column cole 1982 zhang et al 2018 such evidence could also be found in the bacterial biosynthesis of vitamins and the provision of micronutrients e g iron copper etc for phytoplankton communities amin et al 2009 croft et al 2005 durham et al 2015 competition between phytoplankton and bacteria communities were also reported in some less productive environment cotner and biddanda 2002 wan et al 2021 there are still lack of studies on the carbon cycling driven by the interactions of these small players in freshwaters cotner and biddanda 2002 although the interplay between phytoplankton and bacteria communities in freshwaters are far more complex than merely provision and regulation of oc sources biddanda et al 2021 medina sanchez et al 2004 reche et al 1997 co occurrence networks are indicators of species interactions which are universal and important in understanding the structure of microbial communities providing new insights into the networks of potential interactions d amen et al 2018 faust and raes 2012 ma et al 2020 the properties of co occurrence networks were applied to explore the ecological mechanisms underlying microbial interactions in response to environmental disturbances de vries et al 2018 lu et al 2022 xue et al 2018 nodes and edges in microbial co occurrence networks generally represent species and significant connections between species respectively microbial co occurrence networks can also help to predict keystone species i e module hubs connectors network hubs and potential species interactions berry and widder 2014 liu et al 2014 discussed the positive correlations between the two communities indicating that their mutualism might be more important than bilateral inhibition interaction between phytoplankton and bacteria was also reported to have influenced on temporal dynamics of bacterial communities by using co occurrence networks paver et al 2013 a dependent workflow according to sparse correlations was proposed by feng et al 2019 to explore co occurrence patterns and interactions between the two ecological communities rüger et al 2021 assuming that intensities of phytoplankton bacteria interactions were sensitive to the aquatic production and decomposition of oc there is still unknown whether the phytoplankton bacteria co occurrence networks could correspond well to the intensities of their interactions shaping carbon cycling and emissions in freshwaters reservoirs are frequently regarded as a transitional system between lotic and lentic types due to the damming along river corridors reservoirs are believed to have apparently greater shoreline development and higher sediment loadings than natural lakes thus receiving apparently higher terrigenous oc thornton et al 1990 over the past decades reservoir formation and operation were believed to create excessive carbon emissions primarily due to flooding barros et al 2011 prairie et al 2018 however the increase in reservoir trophic status after formation known as trophic upsurge ostrofsky and duthie 1980 structures the succession of phytoplankton and bacterial communities we hypothesized that the phytoplankton bacteria interactions could be intensified or weakened under different trophic states thus shaping the carbon emissions in reservoirs we tested the hypothesis by comparative studies across different trophic states through field sampling campaigns in five subtropical reservoirs in the upper yangtze river basin high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna and 23s rrna coding gene methods were used to investigate the community structure of phytoplankton and bacteria co occurrence networks between phytoplankton and bacterial communities were structured as indicators of their interactions hopefully our study will elaborate on the community structure and phytoplankton bacteria interactions providing implications for carbon dynamics with the two most important planktonic communities 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design five reservoirs in the upper yangtze were selected for the study fig s1 the xiluodu xld with an installed capacity of 12600 mw xiangjiaba xjb 6400 mw and three gorges dam tgd 22500 mw are large cascaded river valley reservoirs on the main stem of the yangtze river impounded in 1955 the shizitan reservoir szt was initially for drinking water supply and hydropower generation however with the fast growth of local society and economy the szt gradually lost its initial functions but serves tourism and fishing activities now xiaoba ii xb

concentration and their stable isotopes were analyzed with a thermo fisher flash h t elemental analyzer for isotope ratio ms thermo fisher scientific ma usa the ch4 and co2 concentrations in the water phase were measured with the headspace method by a g2201 i isotopic analyzer picarro usa briefly water samples were collected using a 300 ml polypropylene syringe cartridge and sealed underwater by its matching plunger excess water samples and a few air bubbles were carefully sprayed out until the water sampled in the syringe was 200 ml then 100 ml high purity nitrogen was pumped into the syringe and the syringe was immediately shaken for 2 min for gas exchange the 100 ml exchanged gas sample was injected into a vacuumed gas bag 0 3 l hede technology dalian china ch4 and co2 concentrations were then measured and analyzed to acquire endmember values 13 plankton samples were collected from the reservoir using a 64 μm plankton net and classified under a microscope meanwhile 18 soil samples were collected from the riparian zone at the corresponding sampling sites of the reservoir in august and october 2020 the endmember values for c3 and c4 plants were from literature ru

bioinformatics analysis was discussed in the supplementary material flow cytometry was applied to analyze pico phytoplankton 2 μm and heterotrophic bacteria in collected samples discussed in detail in the supplementary material 2 4 data analysis alpha diversity shannon chao1 index was analyzed by the vegan package on r version 4 1 1 statistical analysis was both performed on r by taking p 0 05 as

interaction were identified by random forest analysis trivedi et al 2016 the sources of poc were quantitatively evaluated using bayesian stable isotope mixing models by the simmr package parnell et al 2010 parnell et al 2013 structural equation modeling was used to analyze the direct and indirect relationships among all variables in the model all these methods were discussed in detail in the supplementary material 3 results 3 1 co2 and ch4 concentrations and fluxes the concentrations and fluxes of ch4 and co2 were shown in table 1 ch4 concentrations in the water column and the air water interface fluxes increased with the increase of the trophic state mean concentrations of co2 and ch4 in the eutrophic state were 43 7 5 80 µmol l and 0 20 0 06 µmol l in our datasets air water interface fluxes of co2 and ch4 in the eutrophic state were 23 9 4 38 mmol m2 d and 0 18 0 06 mmol m2 d respectively the mean ch4 concentrations in the mesotrophic and oligotrophic states decreased by 26 1 and 61 7 respectively compared with those in the eutrophic state mean values of co2 concentrations and air water interface fluxes reached the highest at 45 3 µmol l and 26 2 mmol m2 d in the mesotrophic state respectively the change of air water interface fluxes of co2 and ch4 seemed to be more sensitive to the change in the trophic state than their concentrations in the water phase in the oligotrophic state the ratio of ch4 co2 range from 0 30 10 3 to 6 26 10 3 with a mean of 1 65 10 3 0 33 10 3 the eutrophic state had a mean ratio of ch4 co2 of 3 70 10 3 0 77 10 3 with a range from 0 24 10 3 to 1 21 10 2 the ratio of ch4 co2 increased evidently with the increase in the trophic state fig 1 a the ch4 co2 ratio in the oligotrophic state was significantly different from those in the mesotrophic and eutrophic states p 0 05 the average ch4 co2 value in the eutrophic state was also slightly higher than that in the mesotrophic state even if it was not significant 3 2 different sources of oc varied with the trophic state the concentration of doc and poc increased with the increase in the trophic state as well fig s3 the average concentration of autochthonous poc a poc increased slightly from 0 08 0 01 mg l in the oligotrophic state to 0 13 0 06 mg l in the eutrophic state comparatively terrigenous poc t poc increased from 0 08 0 02 mg l in the oligotrophic state to 0 51 0 12 mg l in the eutrophic state table s4 t poc concentration increased significantly faster with the trophic state than tp fig 1b in addition t poc and a poc were both positively correlated with the ch4 co2 ratio we found a steeper slope between t poc and ch4 co2 than that of a poc fig 1c the increase in the relative abundance of t poc a t ratio in fig 1d was also found to contribute to a higher mole ratio of ch4 co2 in the water column supporting the above results 3 3 phytoplankton and bacteria diversity and community structure with the increase in trophic level chl a increased from 0 91 0 07 μg l in the oligotrophic state to 26 7 6 29 μg l in the eutrophic state there was also an increase in the mean abundance of pico phytoplankton from oligotrophic 6 43 103 3 04 103cells ml to eutrophic samples 1 17 105 3 11 104 cells ml as well as in the mean abundance of heterotrophic bacteria that varied from 1 97 105 4 90 104 cells ml oligotrophic to 2 27 105 2 85 104 cells ml eutrophic the pico hb pico phytoplankton heterotrophic bacteria ratio in the eutrophic state was significantly higher than both in the oligotrophic and mesotrophic states fig s4 the α diversity chao1 shannon index of both phytoplankton and bacterial communities decreased with the increase in the trophic state fig 2 yet the shannon diversity of phytoplankton decreased more evident than the bacteria in the eutrophic state phytoplankton in the oligotrophic state was mainly comprised of bacillariophyta 40 cyanobacteria 26 and chlorophyta 2 8 fig s5a in eutrophic samples the relative dominance of cyanobacteria bacillariophyta and chlorophyta were 30 12 and 7 9 respectively the relative abundance of bacillariophyta was the highest in oligotrophic sites and it gradually decreased with the increase in the trophic state cyanobacteria and chlorophyta were the dominant phytoplankton groups in the eutrophic state bacterial communities in oligotrophic samples were mainly comprised of actinobacteria 37 proteobacteria 32 and bacteroidetes 10 fig s5b actinobacteria 21 proteobacteria 27 and bacteroidetes 12 were dominant in eutrophic samples in general phytoplankton communities seemed to be more sensitive in response to the changes in the trophic state than bacterial communities 3 4 community assembly the niche breadth index of phytoplankton were lower than bacterial communities in all trophic states fig 3 a differences in niche breadth between the oligotrophic and mesotrophic states in either phytoplankton or bacteria were not significant the niche breadth index in the eutrophic state was significantly lower than those in the oligotrophic and mesotrophic states fig 3b such a decrease corresponds to the inference that the eutrophic state offers more resources than the oligotrophic and mesotrophic states for both phytoplankton and bacterial communities competition for resources was more evident in mesotrophic and oligotrophic states results from the neutral community model showed that the goodness of fit r2 of phytoplankton communities in the oligotrophic and mesotrophic states was better than that in the eutrophic state fig 3c bacterial communities were shown similar characteristics the migration rate m of the bacterial community was higher than that of phytoplankton in all trophic states indicating that bacteria taxa were less limited by dispersal the decreased goodness of fit of the model to observed phytoplankton and bacteria distributions indicates that the relative importance of non neutral processes increased with trophic states such as potential microbial interactions etc burns et al 2016 3 5 co occurrence network the co occurrence network of phytoplankton and bacteria in different trophic states was shown in fig 4 a1 b1 and c1 in all trophic states the co occurrence network had high degrees of modularity 0 4 table 2 their differentiated modular structures were not randomly constructed in the eutrophic state the relatively low modularity with a higher average clustering coefficient indicated that the network was more clustered and less modularized positive links between phytoplankton and bacterial communities were higher than negative links in all three networks the percentage of negative links decreased from 41 4 in the oligotrophic state decreased to 33 2 in the eutrophic state furthermore network topological parameters in the eutrophic states such as average degree graph density and average clustering coefficient were significantly higher than those in the oligotrophic and mesotrophic states in the oligotrophic state the number of phytoplankton bacteria connections in the network was 31 8 of the total connections such results in the mesotrophic and eutrophic states were 34 1 and 40 2 respectively an increase in the trophic state meets the linear proportional relationship with the intensities of phytoplankton bacteria interactions eutrophic communities exhibited the highest phytoplankton bacteria interaction intensities compared with the oligotrophic and mesotrophic samples some important taxonomic groups from the interaction between phytoplankton and bacteria were extracted from sub networks fig 4a2 b2 c2 in all three trophic states most bacterial nodes belong to clades of proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes the node number of these phyla increased with the increase in the trophic state although the phytoplankton nodes in all three trophic states came from the six frequently detected phyla the number of taxa participating in each trophic state differed slightly the connection between phytoplankton and bacteria became coarser in the eutrophic state than in the oligotrophic or mesotrophic states such as proteobacteria and cyanobacteria this suggests that the intensity of phytoplankton bacteria interaction was enhanced with the elevated trophic state 3 6 phytoplankton bacteria interaction and carbon emissions along trophic gradients topological features of the phytoplankton bacteria network were applied to test their statistical correlations with ch4 and co2 concentrations and fluxes fig 5 node number edge number and degree in the mesotrophic state were positively correlated with co2 concentration and flux p 0 001 fig 5b betweenness centralization and closeness centralization were negatively and positively associated with co2 concentration and co2 flux respectively p 0 01 interestingly in the eutrophic network there was no topological feature significantly correlated with co2 concentration and flux the only degree was significantly positive with ch4 concentration and flux and average path length and betweenness centralization were negatively correlated with the ch4 fig 5c however none of the network topological features were associated with ch4 and co2 in the oligotrophic network fig 5a the structural equation model additionally indicated that the ratio of a t affected co2 and ch4 by influencing the relative abundance of bacteria and phytoplankton involved in phytoplankton bacteria interactions fig s6 co2 and ch4 concentrations were indirectly or directly influenced by a t and bacteria phytoplankton relative abundance in the mesotrophic state in the eutrophic state a t affected co2 and ch4 by influencing the relative abundance of bacteria and phytoplankton involved in phytoplankton bacteria interactions random forest analysis fig 6 a and b supported that the main environmental factors influencing the strength of phytoplankton bacteria interaction were chl a doc do c p n p tp nh4 n and t p 0 05 the β diversity of phytoplankton and bacteria also showed a certain degree of influence on the strength of their interaction fig 6b however the explanation of the interaction of phytoplankton bacteria by environmental factors r2 82 82 was greater than microbial diversity r2 54 48 4 discussion 4 1 features of reservoir eutrophication in the upper yangtze terrigenous oc is increasingly recognized as a powerful driver of aquatic productivity by affecting nutrient and carbon availability deininger and frigstad 2019 unlike eutrophication in most natural lakes induced mostly by excessive nutrients inputs the eutrophication in the upper yangtze reservoirs was featured by the synchronous input of terrigenous oc mostly from soil erosions and terrestrial plants and the enrichment of n and p in the water column reservoir sampling sites in our results were more apparently sensitive to the increase of t poc compared to the essential nutrients fig 1d because reservoirs selected in our study are mostly river valley dammed their limnological features e g less water surface ratio and higher shoreline development index compared with lakes were believed to be the main reasons responsible for the results straškraba et al 1993 thornton et al 1990 zhang et al 2022 similar to lake eutrophication an increase in trophic state evidently increases carbon emissions in our results colas et al 2021 sun et al 2021 xiao et al 2022 in our summer sampling campaigns co2 sinks i e the negative air water co2 flux were evident in eutrophic sites but with regard to the different seasons datasets did not support the inference that eutrophication was a co2 sink sun et al 2021 as discussed by grasset et al 2020 we also found a non linearity increase in carbon emissions compared with the increase in the trophic state in particular the mole ratio of ch4 and co2 fig 1d the steady increase of the ch4 co2 ratio corresponded to the a t ratio from the oligotrophic to mesotrophic state supported the inference above yet from mesotrophic to eutrophic the increase in the ch4 co2 ratio did not correspond to the bioavailability and origin of oc in the following section we elaborated such methanation of the reservoir ecosystem from the perspective of phytoplankton and bacteria interactions 4 2 response of phytoplankton and bacterial communities to trophic state we expected an apparent decrease in the α diversity of both phytoplankton and bacteria from oligotrophic state to eutrophic state similar to previous reports shen et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 for both phytoplankton and bacterial communities highly diverse microbial communities have a stronger natural selectivity which is mainly reflected in greater niche complementation and the coexistence of species with different strategies finke and snyder 2008 the niche breadth index in the oligotrophic and mesotrophic states is significantly higher than in the eutrophic state fig 3 community level responses of phytoplankton and bacteria to an increase in the trophic state were similar most of the species involved in the phytoplankton bacteria interactions were the same fig 4 but the interaction strength the thickness of the connection between them had significant differences among different trophic states examples were the connections between proteobacteria and cyanobacteria actinobacteria and haptophyta fig 4 the number of keystone species i e connectors and module hubs in the co occurrence network decreased with the increase in the trophic state in both phytoplankton and bacteria communities although there was no network hub in all three trophic states fig s7 such a decrease indicated that generalists mostly r selected strategists in both communities decreased with the increase in the trophic state correspondingly the abundance of k selected species frequently referred to as specialists increased as the trophic state increased finke and snyder 2008 muscarella et al 2019 the oligotrophic k strategists and copiotrophic r strategists bacterial species are frequently regarded as representatives of different functional groups of oc utilization li et al 2021 the growth and metabolic characteristics of copiotrophic and oligotrophic species are very different and have been described extensively fierer et al 2007 trivedi et al 2013 in our results oligo copio oligotrophic copiotrophic was slightly greater in the mesotrophic and eutrophic states than in the oligotrophic state fig s8 indicating an increase in the relative abundance of k strategists in bacterial communities and oligo copio bacterial specific trait strategies had a positive linear relationship with ch4 co2 in the mesotrophic and eutrophic states fig s9 a nutrient rich environment favors fast growing bacteria while nutrient poor environments select bacteria that utilize nutrients efficiently dai et al 2022 thompson et al 2017 the main reason why our findings are different from lake cases zhou et al 2021 we believe is the dominance of less bioavailable terrigenous oc in reservoirs even in the eutrophic state the increase in terrigenous sources of oc provides different substrates other than autochthonous oc for bacteria supporting long lasting carbon emission patterns solomon et al 2015 ward et al 2013 zhang et al 2022 4 3 phytoplankton bacteria interactions revealed by co occurrence networks bacteria and phytoplankton are key players in aquatic ecosystem functioning their interactions mediate carbon transfer through the trophic web pringault et al 2021 phytoplankton bacteria interactions provided further insights into the apparent increase of ch4 concentration and emission in more productive sampling sites although the a t ratio remained relatively the same however the phytoplankton bacteria interaction here was referred mainly to the statistical interactions on the basis of co occurrence networks but less to the physical interaction of bacteria species living in the phytoplankton extracellular microenvironment i e well known as phycosphere seymour et al 2017 in general positive relationships in ecological networks are usually attributed to co aggregation cross feeding co colonization niche overlap or other reasons and are negatively related to competition or amensalism deng et al 2012 faust and raes 2012 the increased availability of nutrients and oc sources led to a reduction in the competitive pressure between microbial communities dini andreote et al 2015 however in our samples we found the intensification of phytoplankton bacteria interactions with the increase in the trophic state among the connections of phytoplankton bacteria bacteria bacteria or phytoplankton phytoplankton the negative links in the eutrophic network were less than those in the oligotrophic and mesotrophic networks the decrease of goodness of fit in the neutral community model with an elevated trophic state supported the inference above the overwhelming positive correlation in the eutrophic network may be because cooperation leads to coupling and positive feedback between phytoplankton and bacteria species promoting overall metabolic efficiency within the community coyte et al 2015 and making oc more fully utilized with the increase in the trophic state the increase in biomass of both phytoplankton and bacteria would increase the possibility of the physical interaction of phytoplankton and bacteria in an extracellular microenvironment particularly during the summer blooming forming period anoxic or anerobic microenvironment induced by elevated productivity and increased biomass could undisputedly be supporting long term ch4 production and emission the sub network topological features which significantly correlated with co2 or ch4 concentrations and fluxes were all in the mesotrophic and eutrophic networks with high interaction strength in the pelagic environment an increase in cell aggregation will lead to an increase in the carbon flux exported to the deeper water column gardes et al 2011 thus providing more substrate for ch4 production in a bottom aerobic environment this could also explain the significant positive correlation between degree and ch4 concentration and flux in the eutrophic state in fig 5 in contrast a relative decrease in cell aggregation i e phytoplankton bacteria interaction would reduce downward carbon fluxes hopkinson and vallino 2005 leading to increased respiration and co2 production at the upper water column and air water interface 4 4 generalized patterns of carbon cycling driven by phytoplankton bacteria interactions biodiversity has the potential to affect ecosystem functions schnyder et al 2018 our analysis of phytoplankton bacteria interactions based on a co occurrence network guided our inference that oc production utilization and carbon emissions along with the increase in the trophic state are more complex to simplify the above analysis we generalize and propose two potential but distinctive patterns of phytoplankton bacterial interactions a phytoplankton induced in an oligotrophic state inorganic nutrients in in fig 7 n or p strongly limit aquatic productivity particularly the growth of phytoplankton bacterial communities appear to be heavily dependent on autochthonous oc production mainly from phytoplankton and b bacteria regulated in the eutrophic state the connection or dependence between phytoplankton and bacteria is maintained by the fast turnover of inorganic nutrients or available co2 in the water phase particularly during algal blooms the development of phytoplankton communities contributes to autochthonous oc readily or possibly among the first to be decomposed or mineralized by bacteria guillemette et al 2013 thus if limited inorganic nutrients from bacterial mineralization or available co2 cannot support the further increase of phytoplanktonic productivity surplus oc mostly terrigenous induces a further microbial metabolic loop of ch4 in between the two patterns mentioned above phytoplankton bacteria interactions seem plausibly decoupled dash double headed arrow in fig 7 nutrient limitation for phytoplankton may not be mitigated by inorganic nutrient turnover by bacteria yet bacteria productivity may also be limited by the availability of both autochthonous and terrigenous oc in the system this can explain the inflection point of some important parameters in co occurrence networks in the mesotrophic state table 2 e g network complexity average path length average clustering and modularity for our future work we realize that bridging gaps between microbial diversity and carbon rates or fluxes among the components in fig 7 could provide effective and direct evidence to support our empirical inferences for example bacterial carbon demand and extracellular carbon release are important indicators for studying the strength of phytoplankton bacteria interactions so we will improve the research methods of these two important indicators in future studies in addition co occurrence network analysis can only reveal static co occurrence patterns of microbial communities in a certain environment and further experimental validation of this interaction is needed to unravel the exact reasons behind the observed patterns the contribution of nutrient enrichments to carbon cycling needs to be further quantified through the basis of phytoplankton bacteria interactions 5 conclusion the increase in the trophic state enhanced the interaction between phytoplankton and bacterial communities however both their diversity and niche breadth index decreased with the elevated trophic states the large input of terrigenous oc enhanced co2 and ch4 concentrations and their air water fluxes along the trophic gradient nutrient variables and diversity indexes were important predictors of the strength of phytoplankton bacteria interactions the transformation of bacterial specific trait strategies oligo copio regulated microbial carbon metabolism and carbon emissions in different trophic states our findings provide a candidate mechanism underlying the interaction of phytoplankton and bacteria which would give important implications for carbon dynamics in aquatic ecosystems along a trophic gradient declaration of competing interest

1889,freshwaters are important carbon sources to the atmosphere and are influenced by different sources of organic carbon oc microbial community is a crucial trophic network driving carbon cycling in the aquatic ecosystems yet whether and how their interactions affect carbon cycling and emissions in the reservoir remains unclear here we explored the interactions between phytoplankton and bacteria in reservoirs along a trophic gradient an increase in the trophic state intensified the interaction between phytoplankton and bacteria communities their diversity and niche breadth indexes both decreased such intensification was contributed not only by the input of nutrients triggering an increase in trophic state but also by the bulk input of terrigenous oc shaping the concentrations of co2 and ch4 in the water phase and their air water fluxes along the trophic gradient upon this a conceptual framework was proposed to explain the positive negative feedback of phytoplankton bacterial interactions to carbon emissions projecting the dual regulation of aquatic ecosystems and carbon dynamics along a trophic gradient keywords ch4 air water flux autochthonous organic carbon community assembly co occurrence network data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction freshwaters are sentinels of global warming and also integrators or regulators for climate change serving as important carbon sources to the atmosphere williamson et al 2009 the most recent estimates by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc proposed that annual co2 emission from global freshwaters was 1 5 pg c co2 yr 1 ipcc 2021 freshwaters ch4 annual emission was 159 tgch4 yr 1 within in a range between 117 tgch4 yr 1 and 212 tgch4 yr 1 ipcc 2021 saunois et al 2020 compared with earlier global estimates in the fifth assessment report by ipcc carbon emissions from global freshwaters ipcc 2014 particularly ch4 were believed to be experiencing fast growth over the past decades the contribution of global freshwater carbon emissions is quite disproportionate to their relatively limited scale approximately or even 3 of the earth s continents downing et al 2006 gruca rokosz et al 2020 anthropogenic activities e g water regulations and point or non point pollutions have been considered as the most important drivers to increase the carbon emissions from global freshwaters beaulieu et al 2019 stanley et al 2016 the imbroglio among nutrient enrichment global warming and carbon cycling projects the large potential uncertainties in understanding and accounting for carbon emissions in freshwater systems under increased anthropogenic activities although these water bodies are still categorized as natural sources of co2 and ch4 in ipcc s global biogeochemical cycles elevated riverine co2 and ch4 emissions were reported to be evident in river basins with fast urbanization chen et al 2021 gu et al 2022 patel et al 2022 in particular effluents from wastewater treatment plants were reported to stimulate ch4 emission in receiving rivers alshboul et al 2016 jin et al 2018 eutrophication in lakes or reservoirs mostly induced by anthropogenic nutrient inputs has been widely recognized as the major driver responsible for the elevation of carbon emissions beaulieu et al 2019 decreased co2 emission and elevated ch4 emission were reported in a large number of eutrophic lakes or reservoirs sun et al 2021 xiao et al 2020 because excessive organic carbon oc and nutrients input from anthropogenic activities were the cause of elevated carbon emission from freshwaters the planktonic communities in particular phytoplankton and bacteria as primary producers and decomposers play the fundamental roles that regulate the inputs of oc and nutrients shaping the profile of freshwater carbon emissions cotner and biddanda 2002 solomon et al 2015 the different bioavailability of terrigenous and autochthonous oc in freshwater would structure the community of heterotrophic bacteria affecting the production of co2 and ch4 guillemette et al 2013 for example terrigenous oc is believed to with lower reactivity but supports longer term production of ch4 than autochthonous oc grasset et al 2018 grasset et al 2021 bacteria can obtain large amounts of autochthonous organic matter om directly from phytoplankton with up to 50 of the carbon fixed by phytoplankton eventually consumed by bacteria fuhrman and azam 1982 inputs of nitrogen n and phosphorus p could evidently stimulate the growth of primary producers yet the bacteria community could also help the development of the phytoplankton community through mineralization and turnover of inorganic nutrients on a simple level the relationship between these microorganisms is based on the provision of resources and can be mutualism or competition in essence at a community level mutualism based on the provision of resources is the most identifiable relationship between phytoplankton and bacteria communities in the water column cole 1982 zhang et al 2018 such evidence could also be found in the bacterial biosynthesis of vitamins and the provision of micronutrients e g iron copper etc for phytoplankton communities amin et al 2009 croft et al 2005 durham et al 2015 competition between phytoplankton and bacteria communities were also reported in some less productive environment cotner and biddanda 2002 wan et al 2021 there are still lack of studies on the carbon cycling driven by the interactions of these small players in freshwaters cotner and biddanda 2002 although the interplay between phytoplankton and bacteria communities in freshwaters are far more complex than merely provision and regulation of oc sources biddanda et al 2021 medina sanchez et al 2004 reche et al 1997 co occurrence networks are indicators of species interactions which are universal and important in understanding the structure of microbial communities providing new insights into the networks of potential interactions d amen et al 2018 faust and raes 2012 ma et al 2020 the properties of co occurrence networks were applied to explore the ecological mechanisms underlying microbial interactions in response to environmental disturbances de vries et al 2018 lu et al 2022 xue et al 2018 nodes and edges in microbial co occurrence networks generally represent species and significant connections between species respectively microbial co occurrence networks can also help to predict keystone species i e module hubs connectors network hubs and potential species interactions berry and widder 2014 liu et al 2014 discussed the positive correlations between the two communities indicating that their mutualism might be more important than bilateral inhibition interaction between phytoplankton and bacteria was also reported to have influenced on temporal dynamics of bacterial communities by using co occurrence networks paver et al 2013 a dependent workflow according to sparse correlations was proposed by feng et al 2019 to explore co occurrence patterns and interactions between the two ecological communities rüger et al 2021 assuming that intensities of phytoplankton bacteria interactions were sensitive to the aquatic production and decomposition of oc there is still unknown whether the phytoplankton bacteria co occurrence networks could correspond well to the intensities of their interactions shaping carbon cycling and emissions in freshwaters reservoirs are frequently regarded as a transitional system between lotic and lentic types due to the damming along river corridors reservoirs are believed to have apparently greater shoreline development and higher sediment loadings than natural lakes thus receiving apparently higher terrigenous oc thornton et al 1990 over the past decades reservoir formation and operation were believed to create excessive carbon emissions primarily due to flooding barros et al 2011 prairie et al 2018 however the increase in reservoir trophic status after formation known as trophic upsurge ostrofsky and duthie 1980 structures the succession of phytoplankton and bacterial communities we hypothesized that the phytoplankton bacteria interactions could be intensified or weakened under different trophic states thus shaping the carbon emissions in reservoirs we tested the hypothesis by comparative studies across different trophic states through field sampling campaigns in five subtropical reservoirs in the upper yangtze river basin high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna and 23s rrna coding gene methods were used to investigate the community structure of phytoplankton and bacteria co occurrence networks between phytoplankton and bacterial communities were structured as indicators of their interactions hopefully our study will elaborate on the community structure and phytoplankton bacteria interactions providing implications for carbon dynamics with the two most important planktonic communities 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design five reservoirs in the upper yangtze were selected for the study fig s1 the xiluodu xld with an installed capacity of 12600 mw xiangjiaba xjb 6400 mw and three gorges dam tgd 22500 mw are large cascaded river valley reservoirs on the main stem of the yangtze river impounded in 1955 the shizitan reservoir szt was initially for drinking water supply and hydropower generation however with the fast growth of local society and economy the szt gradually lost its initial functions but serves tourism and fishing activities now xiaoba ii xb ii reservoir is a newly small scale reservoir serving only as a drinking water source three sampling campaigns were conducted in may july and november 2019 to provide abundant and representative datasets covering different seasons a total of 26 sampling sites were set in the five reservoirs table s1 including two in xld eight in xjb eleven in tgr three in szt and two in xb ii all the sampling sites were located in the main channel five liter water samples were collected at a water depth of 0 5 m water samples for edna analysis of phytoplankton and bacteria were filtered immediately through

phase were measured with the headspace method by a g2201 i isotopic analyzer picarro usa briefly water samples were collected using a 300 ml polypropylene syringe cartridge and sealed underwater by its matching plunger excess water samples and a few air bubbles were carefully sprayed out until the water sampled in the syringe was 200 ml then 100 ml high purity nitrogen was pumped into the syringe and the syringe was immediately shaken for 2 min for gas exchange the 100 ml exchanged gas sample was injected into a vacuumed gas bag 0 3 l hede technology dalian china ch4 and co2 concentrations were then measured and analyzed to acquire endmember values 13 plankton samples were collected from the reservoir using a 64 μm plankton net and classified under a microscope meanwhile 18 soil samples were collected from the riparian zone at the corresponding sampling sites of the reservoir in august and october 2020 the endmember values for c3 and c4 plants were from literature ru et al 2020 tao et al 2009 δ 13c and n c mole ratio of particulate organic matter pom from all endmembers were shown in table s2 results for terrigenous and autochthonous poc shares were displayed in

were synthesized and used for the phytoplankton 23s rrna gene sherwood and presting 2007 yoon et al 2016 amplicons were purified with the axyprep dna gel extraction kit axygen biosciences ca usa the pcr products of each sample were combined in equimolar ratios and sequenced on the illumina miseq pe250 platform illumina san diego usa at shanghai majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china bioinformatics analysis was discussed in the supplementary material flow cytometry was applied to analyze pico phytoplankton 2 μm and heterotrophic bacteria in collected samples discussed in detail in the supplementary material 2 4 data analysis alpha diversity shannon chao1 index was analyzed by the vegan package on r version 4 1 1 statistical analysis was both performed on r by taking p 0 05 as the significance level the trophic state of each sampling site was based on the trophic level index tli supplementary of methods s3 for detail the positive negative interactions were evaluated based on the statistical analyses of co occurrence networks of phytoplankton and bacterial communities the co occurrence networks were established by the relative abundance of high throughput sequencing of 23s rrna and 16s rrna coding gene the community level habitat niche breadths were estimated to explore community assembly the main environmental predictors for the intensity of phytoplankton bacteria interaction were identified by random forest analysis trivedi et al 2016 the sources of poc were quantitatively evaluated using bayesian stable isotope mixing models by the simmr package parnell et al 2010 parnell et al 2013 structural equation modeling was used to analyze the direct and indirect relationships among all variables in the model all these methods were discussed in detail in the supplementary material 3 results 3 1 co2 and ch4 concentrations and fluxes the concentrations and fluxes of ch4 and co2 were shown in table 1 ch4 concentrations in the water column and the air water interface fluxes increased with the increase of the trophic state mean concentrations of co2 and ch4 in the eutrophic state were 43 7 5 80 µmol l and 0 20 0 06 µmol l in our datasets air water interface fluxes of co2 and ch4 in the eutrophic state were 23 9 4 38 mmol m2 d and 0 18 0 06 mmol m2 d respectively the mean ch4 concentrations in the mesotrophic and oligotrophic states decreased by 26 1 and 61 7 respectively compared with those in the eutrophic state mean values of co2 concentrations and air water interface fluxes reached the highest at 45 3 µmol l and 26 2 mmol m2 d in the mesotrophic state respectively the change of air water interface fluxes of co2 and ch4 seemed to be more sensitive to the change in the trophic state than their concentrations in the water phase in the oligotrophic state the ratio of ch4 co2 range from 0 30 10 3 to 6 26 10 3 with a mean of 1 65 10 3 0 33 10 3 the eutrophic state had a mean ratio of ch4 co2 of 3 70 10 3 0 77 10 3 with a range from 0 24 10 3 to 1 21 10 2 the ratio of ch4 co2 increased evidently with the increase in the trophic state fig 1 a the ch4 co2 ratio in the oligotrophic state was significantly different from those in the mesotrophic and eutrophic states p 0 05 the average ch4 co2 value in the eutrophic state was also slightly higher than that in the mesotrophic state even if it was not significant 3 2 different sources of oc varied with the trophic state the concentration of doc and poc increased with the increase in the trophic state as well fig s3 the average concentration of autochthonous poc a poc increased slightly from 0 08 0 01 mg l in the oligotrophic state to 0 13 0 06 mg l in the eutrophic state comparatively terrigenous poc t poc increased from 0 08 0 02 mg l in the oligotrophic state to 0 51 0 12 mg l in the eutrophic state table s4 t poc concentration increased significantly faster with the trophic state than tp fig 1b in addition t poc and a poc were both positively correlated with the ch4 co2 ratio we found a steeper slope between t poc and ch4 co2 than that of a poc fig 1c the increase in the relative abundance of t poc a t ratio in fig 1d was also found to contribute to a higher mole ratio of ch4 co2 in the water column supporting the above results 3 3 phytoplankton and bacteria diversity and community structure with the increase in trophic level chl a increased from 0 91 0 07 μg l in the oligotrophic state to 26 7 6 29 μg l in the eutrophic state there was also an increase in the mean abundance of pico phytoplankton from oligotrophic 6 43 103 3 04 103cells ml to eutrophic samples 1 17 105 3 11 104 cells ml as well as in the mean abundance of heterotrophic bacteria that varied from 1 97 105 4 90 104 cells ml oligotrophic to 2 27 105 2 85 104 cells ml eutrophic the pico hb pico phytoplankton heterotrophic bacteria ratio in the eutrophic state was significantly higher than both in the oligotrophic and mesotrophic states fig s4 the α diversity chao1 shannon index of both phytoplankton and bacterial communities decreased with the increase in the trophic state fig 2 yet the shannon diversity of phytoplankton decreased more evident than the bacteria in the eutrophic state phytoplankton in the oligotrophic state was mainly comprised of bacillariophyta 40 cyanobacteria 26 and chlorophyta 2 8 fig s5a in eutrophic samples the relative dominance of cyanobacteria bacillariophyta and chlorophyta were 30 12 and 7 9 respectively the relative abundance of bacillariophyta was the highest in oligotrophic sites and it gradually decreased with the increase in the trophic state cyanobacteria and chlorophyta were the dominant phytoplankton groups in the eutrophic state bacterial communities in oligotrophic samples were mainly comprised of actinobacteria 37 proteobacteria 32 and bacteroidetes 10 fig s5b actinobacteria 21 proteobacteria 27 and bacteroidetes 12 were dominant in eutrophic samples in general phytoplankton communities seemed to be more sensitive in response to the changes in the trophic state than bacterial communities 3 4 community assembly the niche breadth index of phytoplankton were lower than bacterial communities in all trophic states fig 3 a differences in niche breadth between the oligotrophic and mesotrophic states in either phytoplankton or bacteria were not significant the niche breadth index in the eutrophic state was significantly lower than those in the oligotrophic and mesotrophic states fig 3b such a decrease corresponds to the inference that the eutrophic state offers more resources than the oligotrophic and mesotrophic states for both phytoplankton and bacterial communities competition for resources was more evident in mesotrophic and oligotrophic states results from the neutral community model showed that the goodness of fit r2 of phytoplankton communities in the oligotrophic and mesotrophic states was better than that in the eutrophic state fig 3c bacterial communities were shown similar characteristics the migration rate m of the bacterial community was higher than that of phytoplankton in all trophic states indicating that bacteria taxa were less limited by dispersal the decreased goodness of fit of the model to observed phytoplankton and bacteria distributions indicates that the relative importance of non neutral processes increased with trophic states such as potential microbial interactions etc burns et al 2016 3 5 co occurrence network the co occurrence network of phytoplankton and bacteria in different trophic states was shown in fig 4 a1 b1 and c1 in all trophic states the co occurrence network had high degrees of modularity 0 4 table 2 their differentiated modular structures were not randomly constructed in the eutrophic state the relatively low modularity with a higher average clustering coefficient indicated that the network was more clustered and less modularized positive links between phytoplankton and bacterial communities were higher than negative links in all three networks the percentage of negative links decreased from 41 4 in the oligotrophic state decreased to 33 2 in the eutrophic state furthermore network topological parameters in the eutrophic states such as average degree graph density and average clustering coefficient were significantly higher than those in the oligotrophic and mesotrophic states in the oligotrophic state the number of phytoplankton bacteria connections in the network was 31 8 of the total connections such results in the mesotrophic and eutrophic states were 34 1 and 40 2 respectively an increase in the trophic state meets the linear proportional relationship with the intensities of phytoplankton bacteria interactions eutrophic communities exhibited the highest phytoplankton bacteria interaction intensities compared with the oligotrophic and mesotrophic samples some important taxonomic groups from the interaction between phytoplankton and bacteria were extracted from sub networks fig 4a2 b2 c2 in all three trophic states most bacterial nodes belong to clades of proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes the node number of these phyla increased with the increase in the trophic state although the phytoplankton nodes in all three trophic states came from the six frequently detected phyla the number of taxa participating in each trophic state differed slightly the connection between phytoplankton and bacteria became coarser in the eutrophic state than in the oligotrophic or mesotrophic states such as proteobacteria and cyanobacteria this suggests that the intensity of phytoplankton bacteria interaction was enhanced with the elevated trophic state 3 6 phytoplankton bacteria interaction and carbon emissions along trophic gradients topological features of the phytoplankton bacteria network were applied to test their statistical correlations with ch4 and co2 concentrations and fluxes fig 5 node number edge number and degree in the mesotrophic state were positively correlated with co2 concentration and flux p 0 001 fig 5b betweenness centralization and closeness centralization were negatively and positively associated with co2 concentration and co2 flux respectively p 0 01 interestingly in the eutrophic network there was no topological feature significantly correlated with co2 concentration and flux the only degree was significantly positive with ch4 concentration and flux and average path length and betweenness centralization were negatively correlated with the ch4 fig 5c however none of the network topological features were associated with ch4 and co2 in the oligotrophic network fig 5a the structural equation model additionally indicated that the ratio of a t affected co2 and ch4 by influencing the relative abundance of bacteria and phytoplankton involved in phytoplankton bacteria interactions fig s6 co2 and ch4 concentrations were indirectly or directly influenced by a t and bacteria phytoplankton relative abundance in the mesotrophic state in the eutrophic state a t affected co2 and ch4 by influencing the relative abundance of bacteria and phytoplankton involved in phytoplankton bacteria interactions random forest analysis fig 6 a and b supported that the main environmental factors influencing the strength of phytoplankton bacteria interaction were chl a doc do c p n p tp nh4 n and t p 0 05 the β diversity of phytoplankton and bacteria also showed a certain degree of influence on the strength of their interaction fig 6b however the explanation of the interaction of phytoplankton bacteria by environmental factors r2 82 82 was greater than microbial diversity r2 54 48 4 discussion 4 1 features of reservoir eutrophication in the upper yangtze terrigenous oc is increasingly recognized as a powerful driver of aquatic productivity by affecting nutrient and carbon availability deininger and frigstad 2019 unlike eutrophication in most natural lakes induced mostly by excessive nutrients inputs the eutrophication in the upper yangtze reservoirs was featured by the synchronous input of terrigenous oc mostly from soil erosions and terrestrial plants and the enrichment of n and p in the water column reservoir sampling sites in our results were more apparently sensitive to the increase of t poc compared to the essential nutrients fig 1d because reservoirs selected in our study are mostly river valley dammed their limnological features e g less water surface ratio and higher shoreline development index compared with lakes were believed to be the main reasons responsible for the results straškraba et al 1993 thornton et al 1990 zhang et al 2022 similar to lake eutrophication an increase in trophic state evidently increases carbon emissions in our results colas et al 2021 sun et al 2021 xiao et al 2022 in our summer sampling campaigns co2 sinks i e the negative air water co2 flux were evident in eutrophic sites but with regard to the different seasons datasets did not support the inference that eutrophication was a co2 sink sun et al 2021 as discussed by grasset et al 2020 we also found a non linearity increase in carbon emissions compared with the increase in the trophic state in particular the mole ratio of ch4 and co2 fig 1d the steady increase of the ch4 co2 ratio corresponded to the a t ratio from the oligotrophic to mesotrophic state supported the inference above yet from mesotrophic to eutrophic the increase in the ch4 co2 ratio did not correspond to the bioavailability and origin of oc in the following section we elaborated such methanation of the reservoir ecosystem from the perspective of phytoplankton and bacteria interactions 4 2 response of phytoplankton and bacterial communities to trophic state we expected an apparent decrease in the α diversity of both phytoplankton and bacteria from oligotrophic state to eutrophic state similar to previous reports shen et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 for both phytoplankton and bacterial communities highly diverse microbial communities have a stronger natural selectivity which is mainly reflected in greater niche complementation and the coexistence of species with different strategies finke and snyder 2008 the niche breadth index in the oligotrophic and mesotrophic states is significantly higher than in the eutrophic state fig 3 community level responses of phytoplankton and bacteria to an increase in the trophic state were similar most of the species involved in the phytoplankton bacteria interactions were the same fig 4 but the interaction strength the thickness of the connection between them had significant differences among different trophic states examples were the connections between proteobacteria and cyanobacteria actinobacteria and haptophyta fig 4 the number of keystone species i e connectors and module hubs in the co occurrence network decreased with the increase in the trophic state in both phytoplankton and bacteria communities although there was no network hub in all three trophic states fig s7 such a decrease indicated that generalists mostly r selected strategists in both communities decreased with the increase in the trophic state correspondingly the abundance of k selected species frequently referred to as specialists increased as the trophic state increased finke and snyder 2008 muscarella et al 2019 the oligotrophic k strategists and copiotrophic r strategists bacterial species are frequently regarded as representatives of different functional groups of oc utilization li et al 2021 the growth and metabolic characteristics of copiotrophic and oligotrophic species are very different and have been described extensively fierer et al 2007 trivedi et al 2013 in our results oligo copio oligotrophic copiotrophic was slightly greater in the mesotrophic and eutrophic states than in the oligotrophic state fig s8 indicating an increase in the relative abundance of k strategists in bacterial communities and oligo copio bacterial specific trait strategies had a positive linear relationship with ch4 co2 in the mesotrophic and eutrophic states fig s9 a nutrient rich environment favors fast growing bacteria while nutrient poor environments select bacteria that utilize nutrients efficiently dai et al 2022 thompson et al 2017 the main reason why our findings are different from lake cases zhou et al 2021 we believe is the dominance of less bioavailable terrigenous oc in reservoirs even in the eutrophic state the increase in terrigenous sources of oc provides different substrates other than autochthonous oc for bacteria supporting long lasting carbon emission patterns solomon et al 2015 ward et al 2013 zhang et al 2022 4 3 phytoplankton bacteria interactions revealed by co occurrence networks bacteria and phytoplankton are key players in aquatic ecosystem functioning their interactions mediate carbon transfer through the trophic web pringault et al 2021 phytoplankton bacteria interactions provided further insights into the apparent increase of ch4 concentration and emission in more productive sampling sites although the a t ratio remained relatively the same however the phytoplankton bacteria interaction here was referred mainly to the statistical interactions on the basis of co occurrence networks but less to the physical interaction of bacteria species living in the phytoplankton extracellular microenvironment i e well known as phycosphere seymour et al 2017 in general positive relationships in ecological networks are usually attributed to co aggregation cross feeding co colonization niche overlap or other reasons and are negatively related to competition or amensalism deng et al 2012 faust and raes 2012 the increased availability of nutrients and oc sources led to a reduction in the competitive pressure between microbial communities dini andreote et al 2015 however in our samples we found the intensification of phytoplankton bacteria interactions with the increase in the trophic state among the connections of phytoplankton bacteria bacteria bacteria or phytoplankton phytoplankton the negative links in the eutrophic network were less than those in the oligotrophic and mesotrophic networks the decrease of goodness of fit in the neutral community model with an elevated trophic state supported the inference above the overwhelming positive correlation in the eutrophic network may be because cooperation leads to coupling and positive feedback between phytoplankton and bacteria species promoting overall metabolic efficiency within the community coyte et al 2015 and making oc more fully utilized with the increase in the trophic state the increase in biomass of both phytoplankton and bacteria would increase the possibility of the physical interaction of phytoplankton and bacteria in an extracellular microenvironment particularly during the summer blooming forming period anoxic or anerobic microenvironment induced by elevated productivity and increased biomass could undisputedly be supporting long term ch4 production and emission the sub network topological features which significantly correlated with co2 or ch4 concentrations and fluxes were all in the mesotrophic and eutrophic networks with high interaction strength in the pelagic environment an increase in cell aggregation will lead to an increase in the carbon flux exported to the deeper water column gardes et al 2011 thus providing more substrate for ch4 production in a bottom aerobic environment this could also explain the significant positive correlation between degree and ch4 concentration and flux in the eutrophic state in fig 5 in contrast a relative decrease in cell aggregation i e phytoplankton bacteria interaction would reduce downward carbon fluxes hopkinson and vallino 2005 leading to increased respiration and co2 production at the upper water column and air water interface 4 4 generalized patterns of carbon cycling driven by phytoplankton bacteria interactions biodiversity has the potential to affect ecosystem functions schnyder et al 2018 our analysis of phytoplankton bacteria interactions based on a co occurrence network guided our inference that oc production utilization and carbon emissions along with the increase in the trophic state are more complex to simplify the above analysis we generalize and propose two potential but distinctive patterns of phytoplankton bacterial interactions a phytoplankton induced in an oligotrophic state inorganic nutrients in in fig 7 n or p strongly limit aquatic productivity particularly the growth of phytoplankton bacterial communities appear to be heavily dependent on autochthonous oc production mainly from phytoplankton and b bacteria regulated in the eutrophic state the connection or dependence between phytoplankton and bacteria is maintained by the fast turnover of inorganic nutrients or available co2 in the water phase particularly during algal blooms the development of phytoplankton communities contributes to autochthonous oc readily or possibly among the first to be decomposed or mineralized by bacteria guillemette et al 2013 thus if limited inorganic nutrients from bacterial mineralization or available co2 cannot support the further increase of phytoplanktonic productivity surplus oc mostly terrigenous induces a further microbial metabolic loop of ch4 in between the two patterns mentioned above phytoplankton bacteria interactions seem plausibly decoupled dash double headed arrow in fig 7 nutrient limitation for phytoplankton may not be mitigated by inorganic nutrient turnover by bacteria yet bacteria productivity may also be limited by the availability of both autochthonous and terrigenous oc in the system this can explain the inflection point of some important parameters in co occurrence networks in the mesotrophic state table 2 e g network complexity average path length average clustering and modularity for our future work we realize that bridging gaps between microbial diversity and carbon rates or fluxes among the components in fig 7 could provide effective and direct evidence to support our empirical inferences for example bacterial carbon demand and extracellular carbon release are important indicators for studying the strength of phytoplankton bacteria interactions so we will improve the research methods of these two important indicators in future studies in addition co occurrence network analysis can only reveal static co occurrence patterns of microbial communities in a certain environment and further experimental validation of this interaction is needed to unravel the exact reasons behind the observed patterns the contribution of nutrient enrichments to carbon cycling needs to be further quantified through the basis of phytoplankton bacteria interactions 5 conclusion the increase in the trophic state enhanced the interaction between phytoplankton and bacterial communities however both their diversity and niche breadth index decreased with the elevated trophic states the large input of terrigenous oc enhanced co2 and ch4 concentrations and their air water fluxes along the trophic gradient nutrient variables and diversity indexes were important predictors of the strength of phytoplankton bacteria interactions the transformation of bacterial specific trait strategies oligo copio regulated microbial carbon metabolism and carbon emissions in different trophic states our findings provide a candidate mechanism underlying the interaction of phytoplankton and bacteria which would give important implications for carbon dynamics in aquatic ecosystems along a trophic gradient declaration of competing interest
