13615,keratin is a major structural protein with high sulphur content it is predominantly found in chicken feathers wool hair hoof and nails over the years the accumulation of keratin waste has become an uncontrollable entity throughout the world environmental aspects may reduce the load of waste generation by waste process engineering such studies focus on the safe and effective conversion of keratin based slow degradable wastes by green methods different methods of waste conversion like chemical and thermal have been discussed various keratin degradation methods have been investigated like hydrolysis under pressure by using steam enzymatic and chemical hydrolysis the significance of keratin with potential applications and aid in the advancement of several environmentally sound bioproducts are described including various keratin utilisation methods with its applications more advantageous are enzymatic and bioconversion methods which assure milder conditions and preserve nutritional properties of the produced biomass keratinous wastes can be used as feedstock however appropriate processing is required to valorise the waste in the present scenario the accumulation of waste is causing water pollution environmental damage and threatening human lives is discussed at the end of the article various critical applications including waste process engineering are summarised this review concludes with a study on the conversion of keratinous waste into consumable products to minimise pollution abbreviation cf chicken feather w watt kda kilodalton u ml 1 units per milliliter w v weight per volume w w weight per weight mpa megapascal pressure h hour keywords keratin chicken feather water pollution toxic waste management 1 introduction over recent decades high wastewater amounts have been produced by agricultural activities industrialisation and global urbanization 1 the repeated wastewater disposal in the absence of enough and appropriate treatment may lead to severe pollution problems eutrophication phenomenon is recognised as a pollution problem concerning the discharge of effluents into the water bodies the peripheral effluents of wastewater contain nutrients commonly phosphorus and nitrogen under this phenomenon the influx of these nutrients from wastewater promotes the growth of aquatic plants thus resulting in depletion of dissolved oxygen 2 eutrophication leads to depleted oxygen levels in water and increases levels of toxic compounds like ammonia which causes deterioration of freshwater ecosystems 3 thus effective treatment methods are needed to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus content in the wastewater the increase in the activities related to habitable human development like rapid urbanisation and overutilisation of natural resources including mining has led to the release of massive volumes of different types of wastes into water bodies 4 electroplating fertilisers metals pesticides paper and mining industries produce toxic metals like arsenic as 2 cadmium cd 5 copper cu chromium cr iron fe lead pb 6 silver ag and zinc zn these metals are non biodegradable possess high density in water even at low concentrations thus gathering in living organisms and soil 7 biological consumption of these metals is risky for healthy humans 8 agriculture based industries produce a large amount of waste that increases environmental pollution which adversely impacts human and animal health a vast amount of untreated agricultural waste creates different problems with the climate by increasing greenhouse gas effect 9 agricultural waste comprises of animal waste chicken feather manure and animal carcasses and food waste vegetables fruits sugarcane maise etc chicken feathers are part of agricultural waste and about 5 million tons is produced as a waste stream per year during meat processing 10 only minor amounts are consumed as animal feed in low grade and bulk amounts are disposed of thus causing a significant environmental threat 11 industrial commercial and domestic wastes are removed by proper waste management processes that deal with appropriate waste treatment to reduce environmental pollution and maximise product recovery however it is still a challenge for several industries to dispose of their waste in an eco friendly manner innovative and sustainable solutions are needed to reduce pollution efficiently adverse environmental impacts can be avoided to a great extent by using bio based and recycled materials or renewable resources instead of fossil fuels several proteins like collagen albumin gelatin fibroin and keratin have been investigated in the development of naturally derived biomaterials however keratin is of paramount importance in bringing a revolution to the biomaterial world due to its mechanical durability intrinsic biocompatibility and biodegradability keratin based biomaterials serve as favourable biosorbents for removal of metals from wastewater 12 chicken feathers can be used as one of the major sources for extracting keratin as they contain 90 of crude keratin protein 70 of amino acids high value elements vitamins and growth factors 13 keratin has high mechanical strength and consists of 20 amino acids which are linked together by forming peptide bonds that contain a covalent disulphide bond hydrogen bond hydrophobic and ionic bonds 14 the various methods used to extract keratin are reduction 15 oxidation 16 alkali extraction microwave irradiation steam explosion 17 sulfitolysis and ionic liquid dissolution 18 keratin has various applications in biotechnological waste management cosmetic and medical sectors 19 there is an excellent need for economic and environment friendly strategies to convert waste feathers into keratin this review summarises recent progress in biodegradation of chicken feathers its environmental impacts and keratin production furthermore keratin types and its characteristic features methods of extraction and various applications are described the focus is on its application as a biosorbent for water purification by removing toxic heavy metals 2 impact of keratin waste on environmental pollution and human health rapid industrialisation and urbanisation is a vital part of modern culture and has resulted in increased waste generation keratin waste is collected in vast amounts from marketable poultry production plants leather factories wool industry textiles industry and slaughterhouses fig 1 these residues arising from industrial waste can pose a significant threat to environmental conditions and human lives water air and soil 20 keratin waste is generated from slaughterhouses in enormous quantities in the form of feathers beaks bones and hard tissues slaughterhouse wastewater has been characterised as highly polluted wastewater and is known to have a negative impact on the environmental biodiversity the wastewater has high levels of biological oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod due to decay of organic matters like flesh blood fat and excreta high amounts of nitrogen and phosphorous are present in wastewater which are released into water bodies 21 the release of biodegradable organic compounds reduces the level of dissolved oxygen in surface water 22 the phenomenon of eutrophication comes into play where nutrients nitrogen and phosphorous from organic compounds released into water bodies stimulate the growth of aquatic plants thus leading to depletion of oxygen stores 23 nitrate leaching and pathogen transfer to groundwater affect the quality of drinking water ramirez et al estimated the carbon dioxide production from poultry slaughtering to 18 million tonnes 24 poultry production has a negative environmental impact leading to land water and air pollution with greenhouse gas emissions like nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide nitrous oxide is released due to the high concentrate feed requirement due to the use of nitrogen fertiliser the other greenhouse gas carbon dioxide is produced during fertiliser manufacturing 25 poultry processing plants produce significant amounts of feathers as a waste by product approximately 8 5 billion tons of poultry feathers are produced yearly worldwide 26 accumulation of chicken feathers can lead to environmental pollution and have a severe impact on people s lives in surrounding areas 27 keratin wastes are produced in significant amounts from the poultry industry slaughterhouses in the form of chicken feathers beaks mixtures of bones organs and hard tissues keratin waste is processed gradually and is deemed to be toxic waste in compliance with eu directives 28 contaminated wastewater produced by these factories creates problems with soil acidification eutrophication and decreases biodiversity 29 the modern methods of handling keratin waste are expensive and quite challenging decomposition methods like incineration are used 30 which also impacts on the environment adversely leather industries generate toxic pollutants which are hazardous to the environment a large quantity of keratin waste produced by the leather industry is in solid and liquid waste forms and is mostly of animal origin 31 the leather industries are responsible for the inefficient discharge of large amounts of keratin waste fur horns and hoofs thus polluting the environment and causing serious health issues 32 the barber and nail artist shops are equally responsible for causing pollution human hair is considered to be a toxic pollutant and is a significant source of urban waste in the country 4 it accumulates in vast amounts as solid waste and chokes the drainage systems in rural areas hair wastes are generally thrown away and decompose slowly over the years open dumps of hair generate hair dust if inhaled in large quantities it may lead to several respiratory problems 33 3 keratin protein keratin belongs to a group of insoluble proteins known as intermediate filaments ifs cytoskeleton element with a size of 8 10 nm ifs are not soluble in traditional protein solvents and are not digested with trypsin or pepsin the term keratin appeared in the literature around 1850 to describe the material that formed hard tissues like hooves and horns the greek word kera means horn keratin is a fibrous protein rigid in nature and is the third most abundant polymer in the ecosystem after chitin and cellulose the classification of keratin protein is represented in the fig 2 based on the x ray diffraction pattern keratin exists in two different structural forms namely alpha α keratins α helix structures and beta β keratins β sheet structures 34 alpha keratin is present in the epithelium of all vertebrates 35 and animal body parts and tissues like horn hooves hair nails and wool 36 the α helix in alpha keratin is resistant to microbial degradation and thus poses an environmental concern alpha keratins have great strength durability resilience and insolubility 26 they are made of hydrophobic amino acids i e methionine phenylalanine valine isoleucine and alanine in specific α keratins are made of two sub filaments based on molecular weights type i and type ii type i is the acid keratin with 40 and 50 kda and type ii is the neutral or basic keratin with 55 65 kda 37 beta keratin is a functional protein found in nails claws shells and beaks of birds with a molecular weight of 10 14 kda beta keratin has an intense cysteine concentration which readily constructs disulfide bonds that impart rigidity and resistance to oxidation 38 approximately 80 90 percent of β keratin is found in mature feather the sulfur content is a deciding factor of the hardness and softness of keratins keratins with 3 of sulphur are soft keratins mainly found in skin particularly stratum corneum hard keratins are those with 3 of sulphur and are found in hair wool feather nails and horns 39 4 techniques for the valorisation of keratin waste for many years now a variety of methods have been established to extract keratin utilising acids and alkalis reduction oxidation sulfitolysis dissolution in ionic liquid enzymatic and chemical free hydrolysis represented in fig 3 among the various extraction methods dissolution by ionic liquids enzymatic and chemical free hydrolysis steam explosion microwave treatment and use of superheated water have gained importance for being environmental friendly 4 1 enzymatic and microbial methods enzymatic and microbial treatment plays an essential role in hydrolysing the peptides from keratin rich materials that can have biotechnological or nutritional applications microbial pathways consist of enzymatic activities and nearly all synthetic enzymes are involved in hydrolysis reactions 45 the hydrolysis process of keratin enzymes involves minimal aspects of treatment utilises less energy and is environmental friendly keratinases are proteases that are microbes with some hydrolysing microorganisms 42 the microbial enzyme hydrolysis of keratin is a safe method to use recalcitrant keratin by products bacillus strains are the primary keratinolytic microorganism for keratin hydrolysis often reported in the literature 43 the new strain used for keratin biodegradation at 30 c is bacillus cereus b5esz the medium used comprises of mgso4 kh2po4 feso4 cacl2 yeast and keratin i e chicken feathers or pig bristle and is maintained at a ph of 7 1 before autoclaving 44 another bacillus strain i e bacillus subtilis amr isolated from poultry waste was used in hair care products for the production of keratin peptides feathers with a limited volume of yeast were hydrolysed at ph 8 0 and 28 c and extracted for five days 45 six non pathogenic fungal strains acremonium murorum aspergillus sidowii cladosporium cladosporoides purpureocillium lilacinum neurospora tetrasperma and westerdikella dispersa were isolated from alkaline soils and tested for their ability to produce keratinolytic enzymes strains were grown on feather meal agar and also in submerged cultures the highest proteolytic and keratinolytic activities were found to be significantly associated with p lilacinum 46 p lilacinum strain pl hn 16 has the ability to degrade feathers after a 3 day procedure feather barbules fell off as they were weakened and partly deteriorated by a 54 degradation rate followed by complete degradation after four days 47 enzymatic methods for extraction of keratin nanoparticles have also been proposed savinase enzyme is used to extract keratin from wool and feather addition of anionic surfactant and sodium bisulfite increases the effectiveness of enzymatic methods 48 various microbial enzymes with degradation condition are listed in table 1 4 2 dissolution in ionic liquids ionic liquids ils are a category of ionised salts with a melting point below the boiling point of water ionic liquids are considered eco friendly and safe solvents due to their non volatile and durable characteristic excellent chemical and thermal resilience non flammability and high solvation capacity at the desired time and temperature keratin materials are added in the ionic liquid with the regeneration of keratin fibres using water as a coagulation bath 49 however the cost of ils is a significant constraint for its usage in the industrial extraction method of keratin the ils of imidazole possess greater extraction capacity and higher extraction levels and the findings were best in 1 butyl 3 imidazolium ion bmim whereas the dissolution efficiency of quaternary ammonium and phosphonium was low 50 concerning anions cl demonstrated the best possible dissolving efficiency with higher extraction levels and no dissolution was observed for bf4 and pf6 anions 51 however at least 65 of the disulfide bond in keratin should be cleaved to achieve dissolution in ils the use of ionic liquids with this group helps in easy degradation by minimising the disulphide bridges like bis 2 ethylhexyl ammonium thioglycolate and choline thioglycolate however choline thioglycolate did not lead to an increase in solubility of feathers as compared to amim cl and bmim cl maximum extraction rate with thioglycolate based ils 51 was attained when a 1 20 liquor ratio was used at 130 c for ten hours 52 the various ionic liquids with additives source and ionic liquid solid liquid ratio with the experimental condition are presented in table 2 4 3 steam explosion process steam explosion se is a hydrothermal procedure that utilises high pressure saturated steam to heat biomass material quickly in a reactor the biomass is maintained for brief intervals of 1 10 min until the vapour enters and disbands the substance at an acceptable temperature 180 230 c at the end of the treatment the pressure is rapidly dropped causing explosive decompression and rupturing of the biomass 53 keratin production through exploring chemical free methods like a steam explosion technique was implemented in wool fibres the wool fibres are processed at 220 c with 10 min by saturated steam which guarantees the dark yellow band separation of the substantial component by a 120 mesh cut screen the liquid is processed by centrifugation sedimentation and finally the supernatant is retrieved 54 the dissolved protein is extracted from the supernatant is purified with acetone and then cleaned with distilled water flash steam explosion is considered to be a safe and functional pre treatment method to improve feather solubility in deionised water and solvents or buffers like potassium phosphate pbs 0 01 m ph 7 5 as well as 2 urea and 0 2 naoh during the pretreatment stage the feathers were put in the chamber of the steam explosion unit at 1 4 2 mpa steam pressure for a duration of 0 5 5 min followed by explosive decompression within 0 1 s the yield of extraction improved with a rise in the pressure of sfe treatment in all considered media however the impact of the pressure increase was more for pbs urea 2 buffer and naoh 0 05 m 55 the impact of increased pressure on different buffers led to a greater yield in keratin extraction the optimal condition with source and degradation property by steam explosion methods is described in table 3 4 4 microwave irradiation process microwave technology has been widely developed over the last 20 years as a useful tool for chemical reactions the benefit of this technology is the attainment of a more homogeneous heating process in less time in this process all polar molecules found in the reactor adsorb energy in microwave assisted heating thereby ensuring a rapid and homogeneous increase of temperature with fewer reaction times resulting in predictable energy saving microwave irradiation was explored as a chemical free process for the extraction of keratin from wool 56 microwave irradiation was applied to a sample of wool immersed in water for up to 60 min with different temperatures and liquor ratios 150 c 1 5 170 c 1 30 and 180 c 1 100 after this the yellowish brown slurry was passed through 120 mesh to extract the liquid fraction which was again filtered at 0 65 μm and then freeze dried to obtain a powder consisting of proteins free amino acids and polypeptides the extraction yield improved with a rise in temperature the microwave alkali method was also analysed for the extraction of proteins from feathers the maximum extraction yield of 26 74 mg ml was obtained using an input of 800 w with 0 5 m sodium hydroxide concentration with a liquor ratio of 1 50 for 10 min 57 the microwave irradiation method with temperature time and yield are described in table 4 4 5 superheated water method keratin hydrolysis with superheated water consists of the treatment of biomass with water at different pressure and temperature conditions until the protein is broken into oligopeptides wool fibres were superheated at 170 c with a pressure of 7 bar for 60 min and the solution collected was washed thrice to extract solid substance superheated water treatment was often used for keratin extraction from feathers which were enclosed in a pressure cell with water at 20 mg ml and kept in a pre heated oven the degree of dissolution depends on the temperature and time of treatment under these conditions an extraction yield of approximately 95 was attained with a molar mass between 1 and 1 8 kda 55 the dissolution percentage concerning temperature and time is shown in the graph fig 4 keratin extraction by chemical hydrolysis acid base catalyst requires high temperature and pressure and poses a significant environmental risk the chemical hydrolysis process causes emission of certain gases like co and so2 into the environment which is responsible for causing cancer and various respiratory and cardiovascular diseases 58 although the hydrolysis is highly efficient certain amino acids like tryptophan are lost in the process the product obtained will have low nutritional value due to minor amounts of essential amino acids its solubility and stability are dependent on the rate of degradation of the protein thus it is vital to develop smart and efficient biotechnological methods for keratin extraction which are also environmental friendly in comparison to the chemical method protein degradation for extraction with enzymes ionic liquids steam explosion microwave irradiation and superheated water extraction are considered green and eco friendly methods extracting through dissolution in ionic liquids results in complete recovery of keratinous material and is also an eco friendly approach however the high expenses limit its industrial usage the enzymatic process is highly expensive with little guarantee pertaining to extraction yield lastly the steam explosion microwave and superheated water treatments require thermal energy and increased pressure and temperature conditions to destroy keratinous biomass and can have a severe environmental impact hence it is necessary to develop economical sustainable and eco friendly methods of keratin extraction 5 application of valorised keratin keratin has a wide range of applications and serious efforts have been put in the development of several methods involved in the extraction of keratin based on the type of application keratin is extracted and designed in many forms like films fibres biomaterials hydrogels sponge and scaffold keratin is a protein with cysteine residues in high amounts that form the backbone of the polypeptide this residue builds sulfur sulfur bonds with another cysteine molecule to form disulphide bridges i e cysteine cysteine cross linkage to give strength and stiffness to the keratin in solid state 59 importance of keratin in the various industrial sectors has been cited through many scientific works of literature for decades keratin based biomaterials have been used in biomedical application keratin based biomaterials along with other active ingredients such as growth factors cellular extracts or pharmaceuticals they can augment the wound healing cascade combination of these materials with tissue engineering techniques has resulted in many positive clinical outcomes 60 the keratin based biomaterials possess the intrinsic ability to self assemble are biocompatible and biodegradable and encourage cellular proliferation 61 they are readily available in the global market the incorporation of nanostructures with biopolymers has excellent potential and exhibits improved mechanical thermal and barrier properties 62 bio nanocomposites have gained attention because of their enhanced material properties with the aid of nano reinforcements the two different nanoparticles montmorillonite mmt and cellulose nanocrystals cncs at 0 1 3 5 and 10 loading contents were studied as reinforcement materials in modified chicken feather keratin 63 keratin can become mainstream biomaterial in the future if its mechanical and physical properties are enhanced several approaches for modulating its properties have been considered including the addition of natural and synthetic polymers based on the extraction method applied the cysteine containing proteins form keratoses during the oxidation process and kerateins during reduction and attributed to the presence of sulfur containing groups in them 64 keratoses are hygroscopic water soluble non disulfide cross linkable and are prone to hydrolytic deterioration at extreme ph mainly due to polarisation of cysteic acid groups 65 hydrolytic degradation leads to faster degradation of keratoses in vivo contrarily kerateins exhibit low polarity and low solubility in water but they possess more stability at extreme ph conditions kerateins undergo oxidative coupling by re crosslinking of cysteine groups which causes the biomaterials to survive in vivo conditions from weeks to months 66 the strong foundation for the expansion of keratin containing biomaterials is due to its unique physical chemical and biological aspects since 1972 keratin has been used in various forms such as gels films and scaffolds 67 the primary research using keratin based biomaterial was carried out when vascular grafts coated with keratin were placed in dogs for over 200 days without incidence of thrombosis 68 since then keratin is being used as a biomaterial in bone regeneration hemostasis nerve repair and wound healing 69 keratin biomaterials have cell binding motifs like leucine aspartic acid valine ldv and glutamic acid serine eds which are responsible for cellular proliferation 61 keratins are even trusted to participate in controlling functions to mediate cellular performance like other intermediate filaments 70 thus these biological activities in keratin based biomaterials can prove to be a beneficial role in tissue engineering applications fig 5 5 1 keratin in hydrogel hydrogels are hydrophilic polymers in chain network held by inherent crosslinking of individual polymer chains 71 hydrogels have a high water absorbing capacity and are widely used as materials for contact lenses matrices for cell encapsulation protein separation mediums and devices for the controlled release of drugs and proteins 72 the three dimensional design helps in the release of molecules like antibodies drugs and proteins in a controlled manner hydrogels are also known as reversible or physical gels they play an essential role in forming a network by molecular chains involving ionic and hydrophobic forces or hydrogen bonding physical gels are often reversible and can easily be dissolved by altering ph temperature and ionic strength of the solution on the other hand in permanent or chemical gels covalent bond networks are formed with different macromolecular chains by crosslinking polymers in a dry state or solution 73 depending upon the functional groups present in their structure the permanent gel can be charged or uncharged the charged hydrogels show changes in swelling with ph change and fluctuations in shape are noted upon exposure to an electric field 74 for 50 years hydrogels have established a significant position and have a wide range of applications 75 in recent times hydrogels turned out to be two or multiphase systems with polymer chains in the 3 dimensional network in which water fills the space between macromolecules the neuro inductive nature of keratin hydrogels and the proficiency of helping in rejuvenating peripheral nerve injury were described in a mice model 76 in detail the keratin gel channels serve as neuroinductive provisional matrix mediated axon regenerators with efficient retrieval when compared to sensory nerve autografts in another study peripheral nerve regeneration concerning time course was evaluated by neuromuscular recovery and nerve histomorphometry hydrogels containing keratin claimed to accelerate nerve regeneration by improving electrophysiological recovery and also by increasing axon density at initial time points keratin hydrogen proved useful as a hemostatic agent in a rabbit model of lethal liver injury the keratin gel also helped in recovery at the injury site by initiating the formation of thrombus and by making an outer cover at the wound spot allowing cellular infiltration and granulose tissue formation 77 barati et al stated that keratin hydrogels are capable of controllable degradation and can be used for encapsulation and stem cells delivery in tissue regeneration 78 5 2 keratin in films thin layers of a constituent exhibiting great flexibility and massive coverage are known as films keratin solution can self assemble to form a thin film 79 and useful in drug delivery application the cell attachment and proliferation were enhanced in general pure keratin film is fragile and brittle various methods like the addition of plasticisers ethylene glycol glycerol sorbitol and crosslinking agents are suggested in the literature to overcome this issue the film s combination with natural 80 or synthetic polymers forming a matrix is recommended to improve keratin s mechanical properties based on wound type suitable dressing material must be applied materials used for wound dressing should allow angiogenesis and synthesis of connective tissue protein based films tend to absorb the treatment drug and minimise the risk of contamination from multiple treatments there are several procedures to produce keratin films like compress moulding electron spinning solvent casting thermal pressing and layer by layer deposition 81 keratin based films are preowned for tissue engineering applications solvent casting is a standard method for the production of high quality thin films 82 this process enables the production of thin films with uniform thickness and utmost optical purity and is technically convenient the pure form of keratin films have less mechanical strength the addition of glycerol produces transparent films with higher mechanical strength and flexibility and decomposable in in vitro as well as in vivo 83 chitosan is a biomolecule that possesses higher biocompatibility and biological function in wound healing and exhibits antibacterial activity the addition of chitosan into keratin resulted in robust and adaptable films with enhanced protuberance furthermore the multifaceted films were shown to be a proper substrate for cell culture of mammals alternative fabrication technique can be attained for mechanical reinforcement s sulpho keratin powder was used by compression moulding for preparing films 84 the mechanical properties of films can be modulated by regulating the moulding temperature and water content keratins extracted by reduction method and the films processed by solvent evaporation were appropriate for penetration with regards to its mechanical stability and water repellent property the combination of keratin with ceramides was used for the progress of membranes to mimic the stratum corneum 85 keratin was modified with cell adhesion peptides arg gly asp ser rgds at the free residues of cysteine the keratin films with rgds evidenced to be an excellent mammalian substrate for cell growth and exhibited the capability and versatility of keratin biomaterials 61 the keratin based films were preowned for ocular surface reconstruction where the amniotic membrane of humans is utilised as the keratin films these films are translucent and stronger than amniotic membrane with the same levels of corneal epithelial cell attachment and proliferation which signify the standby of amniotic membrane in ophthalmology 5 3 keratin in electrospinning nano fibres keratin with the characteristic microstructural property is used in composites and non woven fabrics over the years biocompatible polymeric nanofibers obtained by electrospinning have gained importance in biomedical applications electrospinning is a technique in which high voltage is used to generate a charged jet of polymers drawn towards collection plate 86 the non woven fibrous material is segregated in nano to microscale range improved physical properties like smaller pore size higher porosity three dimensional features and higher surface area to volume ratio can benefit growth and cell adhesion 87 these electrospun nanofibrous membranes have found their way into dressings for wound healing and scaffolds for tissue engineering 88 the electrospinning process for harvesting keratin from hair and wool fibres has also been delayed due to the intrinsically weak mechanical properties of pure keratin protein however keratin s ability to form fibres is improved by incorporating synthetic or natural polymers keratin fibres are prepared by mixing keratin and polyethene oxide peo powder with the weight ratio of 50 50 in aqueous solution also with 7 and 10 of total polymer concentration to counter the electrospinning constraints and create perfect fibrous material 89 electrospinning tends to weaken the self assembly characteristic of keratin resulting in low complex conformation of the protein this phenomenon is not observed in spectroscopic and thermal analyses fibres with different concentration of keratin and peo were produced the instability of water and low mechanical properties restricted the use of nanofibrous keratin peo mats 90 much research is being carried out to enhance the physical properties of keratin 5 4 keratin in sponges and scaffolds the capability of keratin protein to polymerise and self assemble into the three dimensional structure has governed its progress as scaffolds the scaffold materials assist cell adhesion proliferation and differentiation the most common technique for keratin bio composite generation is by freeze drying the keratin solution the sponge scaffolds were produced after controlled freezing by lyophilisation of an aqueous keratin solution sponges with homogenous porous microstructures were thus formed 79 the ph and concentration of cross linkers plasticisers natural and synthetic polymers in the keratin matrix may influence the film like porous composite structure the faster cooling freezing rate of the keratin solution during the sublimation process can influence the size of pores and ice crystal formation long term cell cultivation of wool keratin scaffolds was first reported by tachibana et al in 2001 91 these scaffolds were developed by lyophilisation of aqueous wool keratin solution after controlled freezing giving rise to a rigid and heat stable structure with a homogeneous porous microarchitecture this keratin includes rgd and ldv cell adhesion sequences has excellent cell stability it assisted in fibroblast attachment and proliferation for 23 43 days the diameter and interconnectivity of the scaffold pores are vital for obtaining suitable cellular infiltration and nutrient delivery through the compression moulded particulate leaching cm pl technique the fixed pore size and porosity were produced with s sulfo keratin sponges the resulting sponges had enough mechanical and water insoluble properties 84 it has been discovered that the presence of free residues of cysteine within the scaffold has potential modification sites for bioactive substance immobilisation the chemical treatments can develop this functionalisation in keratin sponges with iodoacetic acid 2 bromo ethylamine and iodoacetamide to give carboxyl amino and amide sponges respectively chemically modified keratin sponges resemble ecm proteins and hybridise with bioactive molecules in the presence of active groups the hybridisation of keratin sponges with calcium and phosphate is obtained by chemical binding the hybridised sponges assisted the production of osteoblasts and modified their differentiation pattern 82 keratin carboxyl sponges have also been put into use with bone morphogenetic protein 2 bmp 2 which resulted in pre osteoblasts differentiation and growth 92 keratin composites prepared without any additives tend to have a rigid structure that restricts its application in tissue engineering hence keratin matrix reinforcement by the combination of different substituents like natural and synthetic polymers has resulted in improved mechanical properties for instance chitosan a natural polysaccharide is reinforced with the keratin matrix chitosan is known for its biodegradability biocompatibility non toxicity and antimicrobial properties which make it a favourable candidate for biomaterials 93 by changing the viscoelastic properties of keratin it can be used as scaffolds for tissue engineering 94 the hydrogel scaffolds prepared using chicken feather keratin exhibit high cell proliferation rate in tissues for wound healing 95 table 5 5 5 keratin as biosorbent for removal of heavy metals from wastewater water being the universal solvent is highly vulnerable to pollution every year chemical wastes from chemical industries are disposed of in large quantities into rivers and lakes if appropriate and effective wastewater treatment methods are not applied it can lead to severe water pollution 96 wastewater discharged from chemical industries comprises of chemical waste in the form of heavy metals and its complexes which are dangerous to human and aquatic life for instance arsenic as in the form of arsenite aso3 and arsenate aso4 is toxic the contamination is due to fossil fuel production metallurgical mining smelting and rock sediments the higher concentration of arsenic disrupts the cardiovascular function causes bone marrow depression liver tumour and visceral cancer whereas cadmium cd is the most carcinogenic metal manufactured during mining electroplating and smelting accumulation of cd beyond acceptable limits leads to cancer hypertension and weight loss chromium cr is also released from the industrial effluents in its untreated form which is highly carcinogenic 97 copper cu from the electronic industry is left to accumulate in the water when it comes in contact with the human body it results in insomnia liver damage lung cancer and neurotoxicity lead pb in i and ii oxidation states from battery electroplating and pigment industries causes anaemia brain damage loss of appetite nausea and vomiting nickel ni generated from electroplating steam electric power plants and mineral processing industries cause chronic asthma and lung cancer mercury in its oxidative state i and ii forms many ionic compounds and complexes with other substances in wastewater it is hazardous to the nervous renal and circulatory systems zinc zn from mining and manufacturing industries lead to diarrhea distress and nausea over the years various wastewater treatment methods have been used to remove heavy metals and to purify water biopolymers have benefits in green chemistry with their prominent role in averting ecological pollution application of keratin can be a promising technology for the refinement of metal contaminated natural and wastewater resources the functional groups in keratin protein namely carbonyl carboxyl hydroxyl and sulfhydryl play a crucial role in biosorption of pollutants the hydrophobic interactions found in biosorbents is due to organic and bacterial species in wastewater it involves energy interaction and electron transfer in protein by using dlvo theory 98 water pollution is one of the major global risk factors for illness and death heavy metal ions are harmful contaminants and their presence in aquatic ecosystems pose a severe threat to aquatic biodiversity and drinking of contaminated water is hazardous for humans accumulation of heavy metal ions beyond permissible limits is dangerous for human as well as aquatic life 99 there is a risk for long term contamination in biological systems even if the concentration of heavy metals is below its limits 2 many wastewater treatment technologies have restrictions for sludge handling and its safe disposal which is suitable only for high metal concentrations however conventional water treatment techniques require complex operational system are relatively expensive and are metal specific hence in recent times the use of biopolymer for heavy metal removal has gained popularity 100 by using keratin wool numerous metals such as aluminium copper cadmium lead mercury chromium and silver were separated in another study by mohair keratin was used to remove copper from aqueous stream 101 the oxy anionic contaminants of selenium and arsenic were removed by high sorption of water uptake at lower ph which was obtained by modification of keratin as conveyed by nicomel et al 102 keratin extracted from three different sources like chicken feathers human hair and animal horns were prepared and composed as biosorbents the extracted keratin was examined and compared by fawzi banat et al for zn ii and cu ii ions removal from water however higher sorption efficiency was found in animal horn than chicken feathers and human hair keratin from chicken feathers was used as biosorbent by the same group and its properties were enhanced by chemical treatment with naoh and anionic surfactant dodecyl sulphate sds for cu ii and zn ii removal from wastewater 103 5 6 application of keratin as active ingredient in cosmetic products keratin compounds can be used for skin and human hair as cosmetics it is added as a cosmetic blend with other natural polymers like chitosan collagen and silk fibroin 104 keratin tends to retain moisture as it comes in contact with stratum corneum in the skin and hair cuticle hydrolysed keratin is used as a cosmetic ingredient that enhances skin hydration and flexibility 105 skin layer or film set up by keratin molecule provides a smooth and soft feeling 106 keratin is an essential ingredient in shampoos and conditioners hair loss concealing products and other products used as hair accessories 107 strengthening of the hair fibres and lowering fibre breakages for hair was developed by keratin hydrolysates 107 keratin is also used as a toner for uniform hair colour retention and in hair shading splashes protein hydrolysates are added in hair care products to repair damaged hair 108 5 7 keratin as biofertiliser organic fertilisers were prepared by sulfur bound amino acid solution as growth enhancers for plants 109 sheep wool represents a 100 natural biodegradable material that does not produce any toxic substances or pollutants in the soil or nearby environment hence it is considered as a natural fertiliser which is suitable for protecting the biodiversity for flora and fauna wool fibres magnify in humid conditions and by aerating the soil they benefit the plant roots the nutrient released will be efficient and will minimise re fertilisation throughout the season this is due to the superior absorption and water retention capacity of sheep wool that prevents drying of the soil and reduces erosion keratin is a reliable source of nitrogen which is used to prepare fertilisers 110 keratinolytic enzymes are produced by bacteria and fungi and cause degradation of waste biomass of keratin bacillus genes generate sufficient keratinolytic enzymes and actinomycetes also contribute to the degradation of keratin 111 sheep wool and feather have around 90 keratin and are used in composting feather waste is rich in peptides amino acids and minerals and makes a good biofertiliser the feather hydrolysate has the potential to restore contaminated soil and accelerate plant growth and has been found to be effective in cultivation of banana and other crops 112 6 future perspectives poultry processing industries are paying huge costs for the disposal of their feather waste as there is limited landfill space numerous efforts have been put in the development of green methods for keratin extraction however there is still a need to lower the usage of chemicals or replace them with biodegradable and eco friendly biomaterials the sustainability of poultry processing plants is threatened and the challenge is to design technologies that convert waste on site into valuable products which can be used on site or sold it is crucial to develop effective and eco friendly techniques of valorisation there is still much research to be explored in the utilisation of chicken feathers for beneficial use keratin also used in electronic industries with graphene nanoplatelet gnps based conductive ink 7 conclusion various methods to valorise the keratinous waste have been described by ionic liquid dissolution enzymatic hydrolysis steam explosion and microwave irradiation were reviewed in detail out of all the extraction method the ionic liquids can be considered as a green method as it is completely recovered and can be reused after the extraction process it is clearly shown by the previous researcher that keratin can work as a bioabsorption agent for different water pollutants further research need to be carried out to set up green cost effective and less energy intensive extraction procedures with reproducible physicochemical properties despite a few efforts documented to utilise this valuable waste by different countries enormous scope remains in malaysia to undertake any project for the transformation of this substantial biological waste into useful products thus keratin valorisation based technology will help to convert the keratin waste to useful products along with the reduction of cost for waste management declaration of competing

13615,keratin is a major structural protein with high sulphur content it is predominantly found in chicken feathers wool hair hoof and nails over the years the accumulation of keratin waste has become an uncontrollable entity throughout the world environmental aspects may reduce the load of waste generation by waste process engineering such studies focus on the safe and effective conversion of keratin based slow degradable wastes by green methods different methods of waste conversion like chemical and thermal have been discussed various keratin degradation methods have been investigated like hydrolysis under pressure by using steam enzymatic and chemical hydrolysis the significance of keratin with potential applications and aid in the advancement of several environmentally sound bioproducts are described including various keratin utilisation methods with its applications more advantageous are enzymatic and bioconversion methods which assure milder conditions and preserve nutritional properties of the produced biomass keratinous wastes can be used as feedstock however appropriate processing is required to valorise the waste in the present scenario the accumulation of waste is causing water pollution environmental damage and threatening human lives is discussed at the end of the article various critical applications including waste process engineering are summarised this review concludes with a study on the conversion of keratinous waste into consumable products to minimise pollution abbreviation cf chicken feather w watt kda kilodalton u ml 1 units per milliliter w v weight per volume w w weight per weight mpa megapascal pressure h hour keywords keratin chicken feather water pollution toxic waste management 1 introduction over recent decades high wastewater amounts have been produced by agricultural activities industrialisation and global urbanization 1 the repeated wastewater disposal in the absence of enough and appropriate treatment may lead to severe pollution problems eutrophication phenomenon is recognised as a pollution problem concerning the discharge of effluents into the water bodies the peripheral effluents of wastewater contain nutrients commonly phosphorus and nitrogen under this phenomenon the influx of these nutrients from wastewater promotes the growth of aquatic plants thus resulting in depletion of dissolved oxygen 2 eutrophication leads to depleted oxygen levels in water and increases levels of toxic compounds like ammonia which causes deterioration of freshwater ecosystems 3 thus effective treatment methods are needed to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus content in the wastewater the increase in the activities related to habitable human development like rapid urbanisation and overutilisation of natural resources including mining has led to the release of massive volumes of different types of wastes into water bodies 4 electroplating fertilisers metals pesticides paper and mining industries produce toxic metals like arsenic as 2 cadmium cd 5 copper cu chromium cr iron fe lead pb 6 silver ag and zinc zn these metals are non biodegradable possess high density in water even at low concentrations thus gathering in living organisms and soil 7 biological consumption of these metals is risky for healthy humans 8 agriculture based industries produce a large amount of waste that increases environmental pollution which adversely impacts human and animal health a vast amount of untreated agricultural waste creates different problems with the climate by increasing greenhouse gas effect 9 agricultural waste comprises of animal waste chicken feather manure and animal carcasses and food waste vegetables fruits sugarcane maise etc chicken feathers are part of agricultural waste and about 5 million tons is produced as a waste stream per year during meat processing 10 only minor amounts are consumed as animal feed in low grade and bulk amounts are disposed of thus causing a significant environmental threat 11 industrial commercial and domestic wastes are removed by proper waste management processes that deal with appropriate waste treatment to reduce environmental pollution and maximise product recovery however it is still a challenge for several industries to dispose of their waste in an eco friendly manner innovative and sustainable solutions are needed to reduce pollution efficiently adverse environmental impacts can be avoided to a great extent by using bio based and recycled materials or renewable resources instead of fossil fuels several proteins like collagen albumin gelatin fibroin and keratin have been investigated in the development of naturally derived biomaterials however keratin is of paramount importance in bringing a revolution to the biomaterial world due to its mechanical durability intrinsic biocompatibility and biodegradability keratin based biomaterials serve as favourable biosorbents for removal of metals from wastewater 12 chicken feathers can be used as one of the major sources for extracting keratin as they contain 90 of crude keratin protein 70 of amino acids high value elements vitamins and growth factors 13 keratin has high mechanical strength and consists of 20 amino acids which are linked together by forming peptide bonds that contain a covalent disulphide bond hydrogen bond hydrophobic and ionic bonds 14 the various methods used to extract keratin are reduction 15 oxidation 16 alkali extraction microwave irradiation steam explosion 17 sulfitolysis and ionic liquid dissolution 18 keratin has various applications in biotechnological waste management cosmetic and medical sectors 19 there is an excellent need for economic and environment friendly strategies to convert waste feathers into keratin this review summarises recent progress in biodegradation of chicken feathers its environmental impacts and keratin production furthermore keratin types and its characteristic features methods of extraction and various applications are described the focus is on its application as a biosorbent for water purification by removing toxic heavy metals 2 impact of keratin waste on environmental pollution and human health rapid industrialisation and urbanisation is a vital part of modern culture and has resulted in increased waste generation keratin waste is collected in vast amounts from marketable poultry production plants leather factories wool industry textiles industry and slaughterhouses fig 1 these residues arising from industrial waste can pose a significant threat to environmental conditions and human lives water air and soil 20 keratin waste is generated from slaughterhouses in enormous quantities in the form of feathers beaks bones and hard tissues slaughterhouse wastewater has been characterised as highly polluted wastewater and is known to have a negative impact on the environmental biodiversity the wastewater has high levels of biological oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod due to decay of organic matters like flesh blood fat and excreta high amounts of nitrogen and phosphorous are present in wastewater which are released into water bodies 21 the release of biodegradable organic compounds reduces the level of dissolved oxygen in surface water 22 the phenomenon of eutrophication comes into play where nutrients nitrogen and phosphorous from organic compounds released into water bodies stimulate the growth of aquatic plants thus leading to depletion of oxygen stores 23 nitrate leaching and pathogen transfer to groundwater affect the quality of drinking water ramirez et al estimated the carbon dioxide production from poultry slaughtering to 18 million tonnes 24 poultry production has a negative environmental impact leading to land water and air pollution with greenhouse gas emissions like nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide nitrous oxide is released due to the high concentrate feed requirement due to the use of nitrogen fertiliser the other greenhouse gas carbon dioxide is produced during fertiliser manufacturing 25 poultry processing plants produce significant amounts of feathers as a waste by product approximately 8 5 billion tons of poultry feathers are produced yearly worldwide 26 accumulation of chicken feathers can lead to environmental pollution and have a severe impact on people s lives in surrounding areas 27 keratin wastes are produced in significant amounts from the poultry industry slaughterhouses in the form of chicken feathers beaks mixtures of bones organs and hard tissues keratin waste is processed gradually and is deemed to be toxic waste in compliance with eu directives 28 contaminated wastewater produced by these factories creates problems with soil acidification eutrophication and decreases biodiversity 29 the modern methods of handling keratin waste are expensive and quite challenging decomposition methods like incineration are used 30 which also impacts on the environment adversely leather industries generate toxic pollutants which are hazardous to the environment a large quantity of keratin waste produced by the leather industry is in solid and liquid waste forms and is mostly of animal origin 31 the leather industries are responsible for the inefficient discharge of large amounts of keratin waste fur horns and hoofs thus polluting the environment and causing serious health issues 32 the barber and nail artist shops are equally responsible for causing pollution human hair is considered to be a toxic pollutant and is a significant source of urban waste in the country 4 it accumulates in vast amounts as solid waste and chokes the drainage systems in rural areas hair wastes are generally thrown away and decompose slowly over the years open dumps of hair generate hair dust if inhaled in large quantities it may lead to several respiratory problems 33 3 keratin protein keratin belongs to a group of insoluble proteins known as intermediate filaments ifs cytoskeleton element with a size of 8 10 nm ifs are not soluble in traditional protein solvents and are not digested with trypsin or pepsin the term keratin appeared in the literature around 1850 to describe the material that formed hard tissues like hooves and horns the greek word kera means horn keratin is a fibrous protein rigid in nature and is the third most abundant polymer in the ecosystem after chitin and cellulose the classification of keratin protein is represented in the fig 2 based on the x ray diffraction pattern keratin exists in two different structural forms namely alpha α keratins α helix structures and beta β keratins β sheet structures 34 alpha keratin is present in the epithelium of all vertebrates 35 and animal body parts and tissues like horn hooves hair nails and wool 36 the α helix in alpha keratin is resistant to microbial degradation and thus poses an environmental concern alpha keratins have great strength durability resilience and insolubility 26 they are made of hydrophobic amino acids i e methionine phenylalanine valine isoleucine and alanine in specific α keratins are made of two sub filaments based on molecular weights type i and type ii type i is the acid keratin with 40 and 50 kda and type ii is the neutral or basic keratin with 55 65 kda 37 beta keratin is a functional protein found in nails claws shells and beaks of birds with a molecular weight of 10 14 kda beta keratin has an intense cysteine concentration which readily constructs disulfide bonds that impart rigidity and resistance to oxidation 38 approximately 80 90 percent of β keratin is found in mature feather the sulfur content is a deciding factor of the hardness and softness of keratins keratins with 3 of sulphur are soft keratins mainly found in skin particularly stratum corneum hard keratins are those with 3 of sulphur and are found in hair wool feather nails and horns 39 4 techniques for the valorisation of keratin waste for many years now a variety of methods have been established to extract keratin utilising acids and alkalis reduction oxidation sulfitolysis dissolution in ionic liquid enzymatic and chemical free hydrolysis represented in fig 3 among the various extraction methods dissolution by ionic liquids enzymatic and chemical free hydrolysis steam explosion microwave treatment and use of superheated water have gained importance for being environmental friendly 4 1 enzymatic and microbial methods enzymatic and microbial treatment plays an essential role in hydrolysing the peptides from keratin rich materials that can have biotechnological or nutritional applications microbial pathways consist of enzymatic activities and nearly all synthetic enzymes are involved in hydrolysis reactions 45 the hydrolysis process of keratin enzymes involves minimal aspects of treatment utilises less energy and is environmental friendly keratinases are proteases that are microbes with some hydrolysing microorganisms 42 the microbial enzyme hydrolysis of keratin is a safe method to use recalcitrant keratin by products bacillus strains are the primary keratinolytic microorganism for keratin hydrolysis often reported in the literature 43 the new strain used for keratin biodegradation at 30 c is bacillus cereus b5esz the medium used comprises of mgso4 kh2po4 feso4 cacl2 yeast and keratin i e chicken feathers or pig bristle and is maintained at a ph of 7 1 before autoclaving 44 another bacillus strain i e bacillus subtilis amr isolated from poultry waste was used in hair care products for the production of keratin peptides feathers with a limited volume of yeast were hydrolysed at ph 8 0 and 28 c and extracted for five days 45 six non pathogenic fungal strains acremonium murorum aspergillus sidowii cladosporium cladosporoides purpureocillium lilacinum neurospora tetrasperma and westerdikella dispersa were isolated from alkaline soils and tested for their ability to produce keratinolytic enzymes strains were grown on feather meal agar and also in submerged cultures the highest proteolytic and keratinolytic activities were found to be significantly associated with p lilacinum 46 p lilacinum strain pl hn 16 has the ability to degrade feathers after a 3 day procedure feather barbules fell off as they were weakened and partly deteriorated by a 54 degradation rate followed by complete degradation after four days 47 enzymatic methods for extraction of keratin nanoparticles have also been proposed savinase enzyme is used to extract keratin from wool and feather addition of anionic surfactant and sodium bisulfite increases the effectiveness of enzymatic methods 48 various microbial enzymes with degradation condition are listed in table 1 4 2 dissolution in ionic liquids ionic liquids ils are a category of ionised salts with a melting point below the boiling point of water ionic liquids are considered eco friendly and safe solvents due to their non volatile and durable characteristic excellent chemical and thermal resilience non flammability and high solvation capacity at the desired time and temperature keratin materials are added in the ionic liquid with the regeneration of keratin fibres using water as a coagulation bath 49 however the cost of ils is a significant constraint for its usage in the industrial extraction method of keratin the ils of imidazole possess greater extraction capacity and higher extraction levels and the findings were best in 1 butyl 3 imidazolium ion bmim whereas the dissolution efficiency of quaternary ammonium and phosphonium was low 50 concerning anions cl demonstrated the best possible dissolving efficiency with higher extraction levels and no dissolution was observed for bf4 and pf6 anions 51 however at least 65 of the disulfide bond in keratin should be cleaved to achieve dissolution in ils the use of ionic liquids with this group helps in easy degradation by minimising the disulphide bridges like bis 2 ethylhexyl ammonium thioglycolate and choline thioglycolate however choline thioglycolate did not lead to an increase in solubility of feathers as compared to amim cl and bmim cl maximum extraction rate with thioglycolate based ils 51 was attained when a 1 20 liquor ratio was used at 130 c for ten hours 52 the various ionic liquids with additives source and ionic liquid solid liquid ratio with the experimental condition are presented in table 2 4 3 steam explosion process steam explosion se is a hydrothermal procedure that utilises high pressure saturated steam to heat biomass material quickly in a reactor the biomass is maintained for brief intervals of 1 10 min until the vapour enters and disbands the substance at an acceptable temperature 180 230 c at the end of the treatment the pressure is rapidly dropped causing explosive decompression and rupturing of the biomass 53 keratin production through exploring chemical free methods like a steam explosion technique was implemented in wool fibres the wool fibres are processed at 220 c with 10 min by saturated steam which guarantees the dark yellow band separation of the substantial component by a 120 mesh cut screen the liquid is processed by centrifugation sedimentation and finally the supernatant is retrieved 54 the dissolved protein is extracted from the supernatant is purified with acetone and then cleaned with distilled water flash steam explosion is considered to be a safe and functional pre treatment method to improve feather solubility in deionised water and solvents or buffers like potassium phosphate pbs 0 01 m ph 7 5 as well as 2 urea and 0 2 naoh during the pretreatment stage the feathers were put in the chamber of the steam explosion unit at 1 4 2 mpa steam pressure for a duration of 0 5 5 min followed by explosive decompression within 0 1 s the yield of extraction improved with a rise in the pressure of sfe treatment in all considered media however the impact of the pressure increase was more for pbs urea 2 buffer and naoh 0 05 m 55 the impact of increased pressure on different buffers led to a greater yield in keratin extraction the optimal condition with source and degradation property by steam explosion methods is described in table 3 4 4 microwave irradiation process microwave technology has been widely developed over the last 20 years as a useful tool for chemical reactions the benefit of this technology is the attainment of a more homogeneous heating process in less time in this process all polar molecules found in the reactor adsorb energy in microwave assisted heating thereby ensuring a rapid and homogeneous increase of temperature with fewer reaction times resulting in predictable energy saving microwave irradiation was explored as a chemical free process for the extraction of keratin from wool 56 microwave irradiation was applied to a sample of wool immersed in water for up to 60 min with different temperatures and liquor ratios 150 c 1 5 170 c 1 30 and 180 c 1 100 after this the yellowish brown slurry was passed through 120 mesh to extract the liquid fraction which was again filtered at 0 65 μm and then freeze dried to obtain a powder consisting of proteins free amino acids and polypeptides the extraction yield improved with a rise in temperature the microwave alkali method was also analysed for the extraction of proteins from feathers the maximum extraction yield of 26 74 mg ml was obtained using an input of 800 w with 0 5 m sodium hydroxide concentration with a liquor ratio of 1 50 for 10 min 57 the microwave irradiation method with temperature time and yield are described in table 4 4 5 superheated water method keratin hydrolysis with superheated water consists of the treatment of biomass with water at different pressure and temperature conditions until the protein is broken into oligopeptides wool fibres were superheated at 170 c with a pressure of 7 bar for 60 min and the solution collected was washed thrice to extract solid substance superheated water treatment was often used for keratin extraction from feathers which were enclosed in a pressure cell with water at 20 mg ml and kept in a pre heated oven the degree of dissolution depends on the temperature and time of treatment under these conditions an extraction yield of approximately 95 was attained with a molar mass between 1 and 1 8 kda 55 the dissolution percentage concerning temperature and time is shown in the graph fig 4 keratin extraction by chemical hydrolysis acid base catalyst requires high temperature and pressure and poses a significant environmental risk the chemical hydrolysis process causes emission of certain gases like co and so2 into the environment which is responsible for causing cancer and various respiratory and cardiovascular diseases 58 although the hydrolysis is highly efficient certain amino acids like tryptophan are lost in the process the product obtained will have low nutritional value due to minor amounts of essential amino acids its solubility and stability are dependent on the rate of degradation of the protein thus it is vital to develop smart and efficient biotechnological methods for keratin extraction which are also environmental friendly in comparison to the chemical method protein degradation for extraction with enzymes ionic liquids steam explosion microwave irradiation and superheated water extraction are considered green and eco friendly methods extracting through dissolution in ionic liquids results in complete recovery of keratinous material and is also an eco friendly approach however the high expenses limit its industrial usage the enzymatic process is highly expensive with little guarantee pertaining to extraction yield lastly the steam explosion microwave and superheated water treatments require thermal energy and increased pressure and temperature conditions to destroy keratinous biomass and can have a severe environmental impact hence it is necessary to develop economical sustainable and eco friendly methods of keratin extraction 5 application of valorised keratin keratin has a wide range of applications and serious efforts have been put in the development of several methods involved in the extraction of keratin based on the type of application keratin is extracted and designed in many forms like films fibres biomaterials hydrogels sponge and scaffold keratin is a protein with cysteine residues in high amounts that form the backbone of the polypeptide this residue builds sulfur sulfur bonds with another cysteine molecule to form disulphide bridges i e cysteine cysteine cross linkage to give strength and stiffness to the keratin in solid state 59 importance of keratin in the various industrial sectors has been cited through many scientific works of literature for decades keratin based biomaterials have been used in biomedical application keratin based biomaterials along with other active ingredients such as growth factors cellular extracts or pharmaceuticals they can augment the wound healing cascade combination of these materials with tissue engineering techniques has resulted in many positive clinical outcomes 60 the keratin based biomaterials possess the intrinsic ability to self assemble are biocompatible and biodegradable and encourage cellular proliferation 61 they are readily available in the global market the incorporation of nanostructures with biopolymers has excellent potential and exhibits improved mechanical thermal and barrier properties 62 bio nanocomposites have gained attention because of their enhanced material properties with the aid of nano reinforcements the two different nanoparticles montmorillonite mmt and cellulose nanocrystals cncs at 0 1 3 5 and 10 loading contents were studied as reinforcement materials in modified chicken feather keratin 63 keratin can become mainstream biomaterial in the future if its mechanical and physical properties are enhanced several approaches for modulating its properties have been considered including the addition of natural and synthetic polymers based on the extraction method applied the cysteine containing proteins form keratoses during the oxidation process and kerateins during reduction and attributed to the presence of sulfur containing groups in them 64 keratoses are hygroscopic water soluble non disulfide cross linkable and are prone to hydrolytic deterioration at extreme ph mainly due to polarisation of cysteic acid groups 65 hydrolytic degradation leads to faster degradation of keratoses in vivo contrarily kerateins exhibit low polarity and low solubility in water but they possess more stability at extreme ph conditions kerateins undergo oxidative coupling by re crosslinking of cysteine groups which causes the biomaterials to survive in vivo conditions from weeks to months 66 the strong foundation for the expansion of keratin containing biomaterials is due to its unique physical chemical and biological aspects since 1972 keratin has been used in various forms such as gels films and scaffolds 67 the primary research using keratin based biomaterial was carried out when vascular grafts coated with keratin were placed in dogs for over 200 days without incidence of thrombosis 68 since then keratin is being used as a biomaterial in bone regeneration hemostasis nerve repair and wound healing 69 keratin biomaterials have cell binding motifs like leucine aspartic acid valine ldv and glutamic acid serine eds which are responsible for cellular proliferation 61 keratins are even trusted to participate in controlling functions to mediate cellular performance like other intermediate filaments 70 thus these biological activities in keratin based biomaterials can prove to be a beneficial role in tissue engineering applications fig 5 5 1 keratin in hydrogel hydrogels are hydrophilic polymers in chain network held by inherent crosslinking of individual polymer chains 71 hydrogels have a high water absorbing capacity and are widely used as materials for contact lenses matrices for cell encapsulation protein separation mediums and devices for the controlled release of drugs and proteins 72 the three dimensional design helps in the release of molecules like antibodies drugs and proteins in a controlled manner hydrogels are also known as reversible or physical gels they play an essential role in forming a network by molecular chains involving ionic and hydrophobic forces or hydrogen bonding physical gels are often reversible and can easily be dissolved by altering ph temperature and ionic strength of the solution on the other hand in permanent or chemical gels covalent bond networks are formed with different macromolecular chains by crosslinking polymers in a dry state or solution 73 depending upon the functional groups present in their structure the permanent gel can be charged or uncharged the charged hydrogels show changes in swelling with ph change and fluctuations in shape are noted upon exposure to an electric field 74 for 50 years hydrogels have established a significant position and have a wide range of applications 75 in recent times hydrogels turned out to be two or multiphase systems with polymer chains in the 3 dimensional network in which water fills the space between macromolecules the neuro inductive nature of keratin hydrogels and the proficiency of helping in rejuvenating peripheral nerve injury were described in a mice model 76 in detail the keratin gel channels serve as neuroinductive provisional matrix mediated axon regenerators with efficient retrieval when compared to sensory nerve autografts in another study peripheral nerve regeneration concerning time course was evaluated by neuromuscular recovery and nerve histomorphometry hydrogels containing keratin claimed to accelerate nerve regeneration by improving electrophysiological recovery and also by increasing axon density at initial time points keratin hydrogen proved useful as a hemostatic agent in a rabbit model of lethal liver injury the keratin gel also helped in recovery at the injury site by initiating the formation of thrombus and by making an outer cover at the wound spot allowing cellular infiltration and granulose tissue formation 77 barati et al stated that keratin hydrogels are capable of controllable degradation and can be used for encapsulation and stem cells delivery in tissue regeneration 78 5 2 keratin in films thin layers of a constituent exhibiting great flexibility and massive coverage are known as films keratin solution can self assemble to form a thin film 79 and useful in drug delivery application the cell attachment and proliferation were enhanced in general pure keratin film is fragile and brittle various methods like the addition of plasticisers ethylene glycol glycerol sorbitol and crosslinking agents are suggested in the literature to overcome this issue the film s combination with natural 80 or synthetic polymers forming a matrix is recommended to improve keratin s mechanical properties based on wound type suitable dressing material must be applied materials used for wound dressing should allow angiogenesis and synthesis of connective tissue protein based films tend to absorb the treatment drug and minimise the risk of contamination from multiple treatments there are several procedures to produce keratin films like compress moulding electron spinning solvent casting thermal pressing and layer by layer deposition 81 keratin based films are preowned for tissue engineering applications solvent casting is a standard method for the production of high quality thin films 82 this process enables the production of thin films with uniform thickness and utmost optical purity and is technically convenient the pure form of keratin films have less mechanical strength the addition of glycerol produces transparent films with higher mechanical strength and flexibility and decomposable in in vitro as well as in vivo 83 chitosan is a biomolecule that possesses higher biocompatibility and biological function in wound healing and exhibits antibacterial activity the addition of chitosan into keratin resulted in robust and adaptable films with enhanced protuberance furthermore the multifaceted films were shown to be a proper substrate for cell culture of mammals alternative fabrication technique can be attained for mechanical reinforcement s sulpho keratin powder was used by compression moulding for preparing films 84 the mechanical properties of films can be modulated by regulating the moulding temperature and water content keratins extracted by reduction method and the films processed by solvent evaporation were appropriate for penetration with regards to its mechanical stability and water repellent property the combination of keratin with ceramides was used for the progress of membranes to mimic the stratum corneum 85 keratin was modified with cell adhesion peptides arg gly asp ser rgds at the free residues of cysteine the keratin films with rgds evidenced to be an excellent mammalian substrate for cell growth and exhibited the capability and versatility of keratin biomaterials 61 the keratin based films were preowned for ocular surface reconstruction where the amniotic membrane of humans is utilised as the keratin films these films are translucent and stronger than amniotic membrane with the same levels of corneal epithelial cell attachment and proliferation which signify the standby of amniotic membrane in ophthalmology 5 3 keratin in electrospinning nano fibres keratin with the characteristic microstructural property is used in composites and non woven fabrics over the years biocompatible polymeric nanofibers obtained by electrospinning have gained importance in biomedical applications electrospinning is a technique in which high voltage is used to generate a charged jet of polymers drawn towards collection plate 86 the non woven fibrous material is segregated in nano to microscale range improved physical properties like smaller pore size higher porosity three dimensional features and higher surface area to volume ratio can benefit growth and cell adhesion 87 these electrospun nanofibrous membranes have found their way into dressings for wound healing and scaffolds for tissue engineering 88 the electrospinning process for harvesting keratin from hair and wool fibres has also been delayed due to the intrinsically weak mechanical properties of pure keratin protein however keratin s ability to form fibres is improved by incorporating synthetic or natural polymers keratin fibres are prepared by mixing keratin and polyethene oxide peo powder with the weight ratio of 50 50 in aqueous solution also with 7 and 10 of total polymer concentration to counter the electrospinning constraints and create perfect fibrous material 89 electrospinning tends to weaken the self assembly characteristic of keratin resulting in low complex conformation of the protein this phenomenon is not observed in spectroscopic and thermal analyses fibres with different concentration of keratin and peo were produced the instability of water and low mechanical properties restricted the use of nanofibrous keratin peo mats 90 much research is being carried out to enhance the physical properties of keratin 5 4 keratin in sponges and scaffolds the capability of keratin protein to polymerise and self assemble into the three dimensional structure has governed its progress as scaffolds the scaffold materials assist cell adhesion proliferation and differentiation the most common technique for keratin bio composite generation is by freeze drying the keratin solution the sponge scaffolds were produced after controlled freezing by lyophilisation of an aqueous keratin solution sponges with homogenous porous microstructures were thus formed 79 the ph and concentration of cross linkers plasticisers natural and synthetic polymers in the keratin matrix may influence the film like porous composite structure the faster cooling freezing rate of the keratin solution during the sublimation process can influence the size of pores and ice crystal formation long term cell cultivation of wool keratin scaffolds was first reported by tachibana et al in 2001 91 these scaffolds were developed by lyophilisation of aqueous wool keratin solution after controlled freezing giving rise to a rigid and heat stable structure with a homogeneous porous microarchitecture this keratin includes rgd and ldv cell adhesion sequences has excellent cell stability it assisted in fibroblast attachment and proliferation for 23 43 days the diameter and interconnectivity of the scaffold pores are vital for obtaining suitable cellular infiltration and nutrient delivery through the compression moulded particulate leaching cm pl technique the fixed pore size and porosity were produced with s sulfo keratin sponges the resulting sponges had enough mechanical and water insoluble properties 84 it has been discovered that the presence of free residues of cysteine within the scaffold has potential modification sites for bioactive substance immobilisation the chemical treatments can develop this functionalisation in keratin sponges with iodoacetic acid 2 bromo ethylamine and iodoacetamide to give carboxyl amino and amide sponges respectively chemically modified keratin sponges resemble ecm proteins and hybridise with bioactive molecules in the presence of active groups the hybridisation of keratin sponges with calcium and phosphate is obtained by chemical binding the hybridised sponges assisted the production of osteoblasts and modified their differentiation pattern 82 keratin carboxyl sponges have also been put into use with bone morphogenetic protein 2 bmp 2 which resulted in pre osteoblasts differentiation and growth 92 keratin composites prepared without any additives tend to have a rigid structure that restricts its application in tissue engineering hence keratin matrix reinforcement by the combination of different substituents like natural and synthetic polymers has resulted in improved mechanical properties for instance chitosan a natural polysaccharide is reinforced with the keratin matrix chitosan is known for its biodegradability biocompatibility non toxicity and antimicrobial properties which make it a favourable candidate for biomaterials 93 by changing the viscoelastic properties of keratin it can be used as scaffolds for tissue engineering 94 the hydrogel scaffolds prepared using chicken feather keratin exhibit high cell proliferation rate in tissues for wound healing 95 table 5 5 5 keratin as biosorbent for removal of heavy metals from wastewater water being the universal solvent is highly vulnerable to pollution every year chemical wastes from chemical industries are disposed of in large quantities into rivers and lakes if appropriate and effective wastewater treatment methods are not applied it can lead to severe water pollution 96 wastewater discharged from chemical industries comprises of chemical waste in the form of heavy metals and its complexes which are dangerous to human and aquatic life for instance arsenic as in the form of arsenite aso3 and arsenate aso4 is toxic the contamination is due to fossil fuel production metallurgical mining smelting and rock sediments the higher concentration of arsenic disrupts the cardiovascular function causes bone marrow depression liver tumour and visceral cancer whereas cadmium cd is the most carcinogenic metal manufactured during mining electroplating and smelting accumulation of cd beyond acceptable limits leads to cancer hypertension and weight loss chromium cr is also released from the industrial effluents in its untreated form which is highly carcinogenic 97 copper cu from the electronic industry is left to accumulate in the water when it comes in contact with the human body it results in insomnia liver damage lung cancer and neurotoxicity lead pb in i and ii oxidation states from battery electroplating and pigment industries causes anaemia brain damage loss of appetite nausea and vomiting nickel ni generated from electroplating steam electric power plants and mineral processing industries cause chronic asthma and lung cancer mercury in its oxidative state i and ii forms many ionic compounds and complexes with other substances in wastewater it is hazardous to the nervous renal and circulatory systems zinc zn from mining and manufacturing industries lead to diarrhea distress and nausea over the years various wastewater treatment methods have been used to remove heavy metals and to purify water biopolymers have benefits in green chemistry with their prominent role in averting ecological pollution application of keratin can be a promising technology for the refinement of metal contaminated natural and wastewater resources the functional groups in keratin protein namely carbonyl carboxyl hydroxyl and sulfhydryl play a crucial role in biosorption of pollutants the hydrophobic interactions found in biosorbents is due to organic and bacterial species in wastewater it involves energy interaction and electron transfer in protein by using dlvo theory 98 water pollution is one of the major global risk factors for illness and death heavy metal ions are harmful contaminants and their presence in aquatic ecosystems pose a severe threat to aquatic biodiversity and drinking of contaminated water is hazardous for humans accumulation of heavy metal ions beyond permissible limits is dangerous for human as well as aquatic life 99 there is a risk for long term contamination in biological systems even if the concentration of heavy metals is below its limits 2 many wastewater treatment technologies have restrictions for sludge handling and its safe disposal which is suitable only for high metal concentrations however conventional water treatment techniques require complex operational system are relatively expensive and are metal specific hence in recent times the use of biopolymer for heavy metal removal has gained popularity 100 by using keratin wool numerous metals such as aluminium copper cadmium lead mercury chromium and silver were separated in another study by mohair keratin was used to remove copper from aqueous stream 101 the oxy anionic contaminants of selenium and arsenic were removed by high sorption of water uptake at lower ph which was obtained by modification of keratin as conveyed by nicomel et al 102 keratin extracted from three different sources like chicken feathers human hair and animal horns were prepared and composed as biosorbents the extracted keratin was examined and compared by fawzi banat et al for zn ii and cu ii ions removal from water however higher sorption efficiency was found in animal horn than chicken feathers and human hair keratin from chicken feathers was used as biosorbent by the same group and its properties were enhanced by chemical treatment with naoh and anionic surfactant dodecyl sulphate sds for cu ii and zn ii removal from wastewater 103 5 6 application of keratin as active ingredient in cosmetic products keratin compounds can be used for skin and human hair as cosmetics it is added as a cosmetic blend with other natural polymers like chitosan collagen and silk fibroin 104 keratin tends to retain moisture as it comes in contact with stratum corneum in the skin and hair cuticle hydrolysed keratin is used as a cosmetic ingredient that enhances skin hydration and flexibility 105 skin layer or film set up by keratin molecule provides a smooth and soft feeling 106 keratin is an essential ingredient in shampoos and conditioners hair loss concealing products and other products used as hair accessories 107 strengthening of the hair fibres and lowering fibre breakages for hair was developed by keratin hydrolysates 107 keratin is also used as a toner for uniform hair colour retention and in hair shading splashes protein hydrolysates are added in hair care products to repair damaged hair 108 5 7 keratin as biofertiliser organic fertilisers were prepared by sulfur bound amino acid solution as growth enhancers for plants 109 sheep wool represents a 100 natural biodegradable material that does not produce any toxic substances or pollutants in the soil or nearby environment hence it is considered as a natural fertiliser which is suitable for protecting the biodiversity for flora and fauna wool fibres magnify in humid conditions and by aerating the soil they benefit the plant roots the nutrient released will be efficient and will minimise re fertilisation throughout the season this is due to the superior absorption and water retention capacity of sheep wool that prevents drying of the soil and reduces erosion keratin is a reliable source of nitrogen which is used to prepare fertilisers 110 keratinolytic enzymes are produced by bacteria and fungi and cause degradation of waste biomass of keratin bacillus genes generate sufficient keratinolytic enzymes and actinomycetes also contribute to the degradation of keratin 111 sheep wool and feather have around 90 keratin and are used in composting feather waste is rich in peptides amino acids and minerals and makes a good biofertiliser the feather hydrolysate has the potential to restore contaminated soil and accelerate plant growth and has been found to be effective in cultivation of banana and other crops 112 6 future perspectives poultry processing industries are paying huge costs for the disposal of their feather waste as there is limited landfill space numerous efforts have been put in the development of green methods for keratin extraction however there is still a need to lower the usage of chemicals or replace them with biodegradable and eco friendly biomaterials the sustainability of poultry processing plants is threatened and the challenge is to design technologies that convert waste on site into valuable products which can be used on site or sold it is crucial to develop effective and eco friendly techniques of valorisation there is still much research to be explored in the utilisation of chicken feathers for beneficial use keratin also used in electronic industries with graphene nanoplatelet gnps based conductive ink 7 conclusion various methods to valorise the keratinous waste have been described by ionic liquid dissolution enzymatic hydrolysis steam explosion and microwave irradiation were reviewed in detail out of all the extraction method the ionic liquids can be considered as a green method as it is completely recovered and can be reused after the extraction process it is clearly shown by the previous researcher that keratin can work as a bioabsorption agent for different water pollutants further research need to be carried out to set up green cost effective and less energy intensive extraction procedures with reproducible physicochemical properties despite a few efforts documented to utilise this valuable waste by different countries enormous scope remains in malaysia to undertake any project for the transformation of this substantial biological waste into useful products thus keratin valorisation based technology will help to convert the keratin waste to useful products along with the reduction of cost for waste management declaration of competing

13616,the utilisation of chemical flocculants in water and wastewater treatment has drawn several concerns especially in terms of further toxicity and its effect to the environment the utilisation of chemical flocculants produces non biodegradable and hazardous sludge as by product of the treatment bioflocculants are observed as an alternative to chemical flocculants due to their comparable efficiencies they are biodegradable eco friendly and safe to handle the identification and production of novel bioflocculants has gained much attention worldwide and extensively reported amongst all bacteria receive the most attention because of its availability and ability to produce bioflocculants with many specialties this review paper summarises the extraction and purification processes in bioflocculant production as vital aspect that determine the production yield which is currently still scattered solvent extraction ultrasound assisted extraction hydrothermal microwave assisted and enzyme assisted are examples of extraction techniques while lyophilisation ion exchange and dialysis are the purification techniques often adopted in bioflocculant production this review paper also provides brief introduction on plant crustacean and microorganism based bioflocculant as promising compounds with high flocculating activity the development of bioflocculants is representing important progress in sustainable environmental technology the need to provide a selection of inexpensive promising extraction and purification techniques for bioflocculant production are the challenges for bioflocculant production and future research directions on this subject should be emphasized to be applied further in water and wastewater treatment keywords bio based polymeric flocculant bioflocculant bioflocculant extraction bioflocculant purification bacteria producing bioflocculant 1 introduction wastewater produced by industries through food and beverage production mining dyes and textiles fermentation and its downstream processes palm oil mill effluent pulp mill sanitary landfill leachates and others contain very fine suspended solids dissolved solids inorganic particles organic particles metals and other impurities 1 4 solids particles in wastewater can affect the environment by decreasing the light penetration in surface water and affecting the fish gill 5 6 while organic materials can decrease oxygen availability which can harm aquatic organisms 7 8 however because of its very fine and subtle characteristics it is very hard to directly remove these contaminants from wastewater thus the task of bringing the particles closer and making them heavier is necessary for settling purposes 9 10 coagulants and flocculants are applied to allow particles or pollutants that are light fine and subtle to coagulate and flocculate to form larger particle sizes by neutralizing the charges on the particles 11 12 this condition allows the particles to separate from the water body and to sediment at the base of the tank due to the flocs higher density than that of water 13 the flocculation performance depends on the choice of flocculants used with turbidity removal residual turbidity sludge volume and settling rate become the parameters to define the overall performance the settling rate of particles depends on the particle size formed through the coagulation and flocculation processes 11 14 in other words larger particle sizes with higher densities will lead to higher settling rates and a better supernatant quality as a consequence the easy removal of particles is achieved since they are already physically separated from the wastewater water and wastewater can be treated using various technologies such as physico chemical treatments coagulation flocculation precipitation conventional chemical oxidation and advanced oxidation and biological treatments activated sludge process integrated fixed film activated sludge submerged aerobic attached growth and emerging biofilm process wastewater treatment using coagulants flocculants is relatively simple having competitive cost with other treatment method and able to separate various pollutants such as particles dyes and heavy metals 14 15 according to okaiyeto et al 14 flocculation can be used as a substitute for filtration and centrifugation to separate microbial cells from broth in the food beverage and pharmaceutical industries however despite its high efficiency in wastewater treatment the flocculation process can produce small and fragile flocs that can easily be dishevelled when physical force is applied 14 therefore it is crucial to ensure that the flocs formed are sturdy and heavy enough for the separation process to occur before choosing suitable flocculants it is important to have information about flocculant classifications the flocculants must have zero or minimum hazardous impacts to human health and the environment 16 generally flocculants can be divided into inorganic and polymeric categories polymeric flocculants can be further divided into three groups namely synthetic grafted and bio based polymers 15 as illustrated in fig 1 the use of inorganic or metal salts derived flocculants are common in industrial wastewater treatment 17 ferric sulphate ferric chloride aluminium sulphate 18 aluminium chloride and titanium chloride 19 are examples of inorganic flocculants that are frequently used in the treatment of industrial wastewater the term of synthetic polymeric flocculants refers to chemical based polymeric flocculants that are frequently used as an alternative to inorganic flocculants polyethyleneimine pei polyaluminium chloride pac and polyacrylamide pam polymers are examples of synthetic polymeric flocculants on the other hand grafted flocculants are a class of polymeric flocculants that combine natural and synthetic polymers and sometimes more with the aim of gaining the advantages of synthetic and natural polymers simultaneously 20 meanwhile bio based polymeric flocculants or bioflocculants are those synthesized naturally by either plants or microorganisms examples of bioflocculants from plants are usually derived from beans moringa maize and cactus while examples of bioflocculants from microorganisms are derived from actinomycetes fungi bacteria and algae 21 both inorganic and polymeric flocculants are excellent in terms of performance but the excessive use of these compounds pose several concerns including the trigger of alzheimer s disease cancer and neurotoxicity to human 22 23 inorganic and synthetic flocculants are not biodegradable 15 21 22 thus sludge produced as by product of treatment using these compounds is also non biodegradable for this reason bioflocculants derived from microorganisms have emerged as the most suitable candidates to be explored bioflocculants has been proven as nontoxic and eco friendly behavior towards human and environment 16 24 to date many researchers have reported on bioflocculant production by microorganisms such as aspergillus parasiticus 25 ochrobacterium cicero w2 26 bacillus mojavensis 21 pseudomonas koreensis pantoea sp 27 pseudomonas sp hp2 28 enterococcus faecalis proteus mirabilis lysinibacillus sp 29 bacillus velezensis 30 and many more the methods of extraction and purification are different and specific in each study while information related to the production of bioflocculant compounds is currently still scattered thus causing complexity in full scale production the downstream processes in microorganism based bioflocculant production are crucial to obtain a bigger yield and high quality bioflocculant databases analysis including elsevier www sciencedirect com springer www springerlink com wiley www wiley com researchgate www researchgate net and google scholar was implemented using key words such as flocculation and coagulation wastewater treatment technology bioflocculant extraction bioflocculant purification bacteria bioflocculant and bioflocculant productions there were about 100 papers selected from the year 2000 2020 and 80 research papers from 2015 to 2020 indicated that the bioflocculant production applied various unique methods which rarely summarized in a review paper therefore this paper aims to cover and deeply discuss the production extraction and purification methods for bioflocculant derived from potentially flocculant producing organisms utilisation of wastewater as potential medium in the production of bioflocculant by microorganism are highlighted in this review paper comparison of several extraction and purification methods are presented for the basic reference in selecting appropriate method to obtain the optimum production yield the difficulties and challenges of bioflocculant production and application were also discussed to direct for future research and opportunities of applications in real wastewater treatment plants for various industries 2 bio based flocculant 2 1 plant and crustacean based flocculants bio based flocculants are known as bioflocculants and are extracted either from naturally occurring bioflocculants such as marine polysaccharide flocculants sodium alginate and chitosan and microbial flocculants or are produced from renewable sources such as plants seeds and vegetable tannin and eggshells 31 alginate is an anionic polysaccharide consisting of 1 4 linked β d mannuronate m block and α l guluronate g block residues with biodegradable biocompatible non toxic and non immunogenic biopolymer polyelectrolyte characteristics that is often extracted from seaweed 13 chitosan is a polysaccharide made up of n acetylglucosamine glcnac and or glucosamine glcn linked through β 1 4 glycosidic linkages produced from the exoskeletons of crustaceans such as crabs shrimps prawns lobster and krill and it has biocompatible biodegradable and antimicrobial activity properties 32 similar to alginate pectin is a complex anionic polysaccharide composed of β 1 4 linked d galacturonic acid residues found in plants that is able to form a gel with divalent cations to help in the flocculation and coagulation processes 33 in addition to crustaceans plants also have potential as sources of bioflocculants including okra cassava roots pomelo peel guar gum and bamboo 13 34 table 1 summarizes the types of bioflocculants which are divided into marine plant crustacean and plant categories marine plants such as ascophyllum nodosum durvillaea antartica laminaria digitata macrocyctis pyrifera and sargassum sp are types of brown seaweeds from which alginate is extracted as shown in the table there are many applications of alginate especially in the remediation of wastewater from the pharmaceutical cosmetic food and biotechnology industries 13 35 as well as the removal of heavy metals 36 chitosan is extracted from crustaceans such as metapenaeus monoceros penaeus longirostris and chionoecetes opilio the extracted chitosan can be applied to remove heavy metals particles dissolved organic matter 38 and in the removal of solid suspensions from food processing waste 39 on the other hand bioflocculants from plants such cassia angustifolia have been used to remove colour from dye solutions 42 49 ummalyma et al 45 reported that guar gum guaran can be used in microalgae biomass harvesting despite being biodegradable and safe for application plant based bioflocculants are still lacking in flocculating activity therefore they are often grafted onto other polymers such as pam to promote the flocculating activities of the respective bioflocculants 2 2 microorganism based flocculants another promising category of substitutes for chemical flocculants is microorganism based flocculants microorganism based flocculants are known as biotechnological tools for use in wastewater treatment through the bioflocculation process 50 which are much safer and have higher biodegradable ability 47 compared to synthetic chemical flocculants these bioflocculants are metabolites secreted by microorganisms during their growth phase 51 they can be produced by bacteria fungi microalgae and actinomycetes the first report of bioflocculants was made by louis pasteur in 1876 using yeast as the bioflocculant producer 52 bioflocculants derived from microorganisms are easily isolated optimised and characterised 52 53 the selection of microorganisms for microbial bioflocculants is often based on their morphology and ability to produce slimy extracellular polysaccharides eps 21 54 eps which is naturally adhesive and cohesive helps in the aggregation of suspended solids wastewater 55 according to shahadat et al 16 there are two types of eps namely loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps according to rebah et al 21 in the polymer characterization of bioflocculants variations are observed especially in the composition of polysaccharides proteins dna cellulose sugar and polyamino acids during the growth phase of microorganisms however the concern only focuses on the composition of polysaccharides and proteins since these substances make up the highest percentage of the bioflocculant polymer 29 and indirectly affect the flocculating activity of the bioflocculant to clearly observe the relationship between the composition of polysaccharides and proteins and the flocculating activity previous studies on bioflocculant production from microorganisms especially bacteria are tabulated in table 2 from table 2 it can be observed that the compositions of polysaccharides ps and proteins p were different in each bioflocculant producing strain bioflocculant polymers with a high composition of polysaccharides 80 managed to achieve high flocculating activities fa 90 vimala et al 29 found that the structures of polysaccharide functional groups carboxyl hydroxyl amino and phosphate groups can affect the flocculating activity of bioflocculants a similar finding was also reported by nwodo et al 23 in which hydroxyl carboxyl and amino sugars which are constituents of polysaccharides were found to be able to enhance the flocculating activity of the bioflocculant therefore in the search for bioflocculants with high flocculating activities the presence of functional groups on the polysaccharides needs to be highly considered vimala et al 29 also added that bioflocculants with high compositions of polysaccharides were thermally stable while bioflocculants with high compositions of proteins were thermally sensitive this knowledge is especially helpful in the application of bioflocculants in wastewater treatment based on table 2 the types of carbon sources used were also different and were categorized into defined and complex media media with known ingredients were called defined media whereas media with undetermined chemical compositions were called complex media the complex media tabulated in table 2 normally comes from various types of industrial wastewater and were considered low cost carbon sources since the wastewater was available in abundance the search for low cost carbon sources has been widely covered by many researchers because the production of bioflocculants using defined media contributes to the high production cost palm oil mill effluent 30 65 66 potato starch wastewater 64 70 and dairy wastewater 67 68 72 are example of wastewater with potential as carbon sources for bioflocculant production from bacteria among all low cost carbon sources dairy wastewater shows the ability to produce bioflocculants with high flocculating activity 95 this is because dairy wastewater contains easily degradable carbohydrates lactose proteins and lipids 68 that are crucial for microbial growth the derivation of bioflocculants from bacteria can be performed using either single or mixed cultures 53 the cultivation of bacteria can be performed using carbon and nitrogen sources such as glucose and yeast extract respectively 21 in addition according to abdullah et al 53 and rebah et al 21 bioflocculants derived from cultivation via mixed culture are able to produce higher flocculating activity fa compared to those from single culture cultivation techniques bioflocculants produced from a mixture of streptomyces sp gansen and cellulomonas sp okoh managed to achieve a 98 9 fa 55 and a mixture of halobacillus sp mvuyo and oceanobacillus sp pinky achieved a 98 3 fa 57 however the fa of bioflocculants from single strains are also on a par with those of bioflocculants produced from mixed cultures bacillus sp teri vb2 and pseudomonas sp hp2 managed to achieve 99 and 99 2 fa 55 63 respectively pseudomas sp hp2 managed to record the highest fa among all strains in addition to bacillus velezensis 40b 98 fa bacillus licheniformis x14 98 fa 21 and paenibacillus mucilaginosus 97 fa 62 also showed promising performances bacillus sp is the most studied bacterial species for bioflocculant production this finding is in agreement with lachhwani 11 who labelled bacillus sp 101 as capable of producing flocculating substances with good flocculating activity despite different carbon and nitrogen sources microorganisms from the class bacilli also capable of producing higher quantities of extracellular polymeric substances eps with primary constituents of bioflocculants comparable to those of lactic acid bacteria lab and are the most widely reported 54 73 74 klebsiella sp are also capable of producing bioflocculants with flocculating activities of more than 80 according to yin et al 60 there are seven klebsiella sp capable of producing bioflocculants namely klebsiella sp strain s11 klebsiella pneumonia h12 klebsiella sp myc klebsiella mobilis klebsiella terrigena klebsiella pneumonia strain ny1 and klebsiella pneumonia strain mbf 5 aspergillus sp is also often reported by researchers due to the ability of the microorganism to produce high fa bioflocculants the filamentous characteristic of aspergillus sp allows them to entrap solid particles to form aggregates and strengthens the flocculation structure 75 3 process of microorganism based flocculants production generally to produce a bioflocculant there are several steps that must be followed as shown in fig 2 the steps involve the isolation of bioflocculant producing bacteria bpb the identification of bpb the growth of the bpb seed fermentation for bioflocculant production the determination of the flocculating activity and last the purification of the bioflocculant itself 3 1 isolation and identification the isolation of bpb can be done from various sources using common medium of nutrient broth for the isolation usually the isolated strain of bpb can be identified at the genus level by performing polymerase chain reaction pcr and sequencing 16s rna analyses to identify the taxonomic locus of the strain the sequencing data are then used to construct a phylogenetic tree to recognize the isolated bacteria lineage 63 according to rebah et al 21 sludge from aerobic activated sludge systems is often selected as origins for bacteria isolation for bioflocculation production purposes the reason for this process is that bioflocculation often reflects a dynamic process that occurs inside aerobic activated sludge systems thus the sludge from these systems contains significant numbers of bacteria that are able to produce bioflocculants for example an activated sludge sample from paper mill wastewater contained klebsiella sp zz 3 which has the ability to produce a bioflocculant 60 in addition zhang et al 76 solely used activated sludge obtained from a sewage plant to produce bioflocculant both processes show that activated sludge can be a good source either for the isolation of bacteria involved in bioflocculant production or for use as the sole source in production a later study by qi et al 28 used pseudomonas sp hp2 isolated from forest soil for bioflocculant production the bioflocculant produced managed to achieve a 92 5 fa streptomyces sp isolated from sediment showed the most promising performance with a 99 2 fa 63 which was the highest fa amongst all isolated strains therefore the isolation sources for bpb can be varied but are mostly concentrated in areas believed to be niches for bpb such as soil activated sludge and sediment after the source for isolation is chosen the microorganisms especially bacteria are then selected based on physical and chemical characteristics and chemo taxonomical characteristics physical characteristics that should be considered are the morphology of the bacteria and the existence of slimy eps upon cultivation on selected media this slimy eps contributes to flocculating activity in addition to assisting in the adherence of cells to a surface and acts as a source of energy for microbes during starvation 69 the chemical characteristics of bpb can be evaluated using congo red crystal violet and copper sulphate solution as well as chelating agents and colorimetric methods 21 3 2 growth and fermentation of bpb the next step in bioflocculant production is the growth and fermentation of bpb in the cultivation medium that is optimal for the bioflocculant yield there are two types of conditions in which a bioflocculant can exist first bioflocculant materials secreted into the production medium which can be easily obtained by filtration of the production medium second bioflocculant materials adhered to the cell or adsorbed to the cell surface require an extraction method to take place 77 as can be observed in table 2 the cultivation of bpb using defined media usually consists of carbon glucose sucrose and nitrogen urea yeast extract sources to support the growth of the bacteria the carbon source is very crucial for microbial growth however different carbon sources often lead to different efficiencies in bioflocculant production this could be because of different metabolic pathways involved during the utilisation of the carbon source by bpb which thus interfere with the eps production that is often related to the bioflocculant 73 however the cost to purchase such carbon and nitrogen sources can be problematic especially in the production of bioflocculants at a large scale therefore the quest for a cultivation substrate that is economical easily available and can support the optimal growth of bacteria is of huge concern 64 in addition rebah et al 21 also mentioned that wastewater and sludge contain sufficient macronutrients besides carbon nitrogen and phosphorus that can support the growth of microorganisms leading to bioflocculant production to achieve the aforementioned statement table 2 lists cost effective substrates that are capable of producing bioflocculants with promising flocculating activities wastewater which is abundantly available can be the best candidate as a substitute for the substrate frequently used in the production of bioflocculants dairy 67 68 72 and potato starch 64 70 wastewaters are the most effective cultivation substrates in the production of bioflocculants which each yield flocculating activities higher than 90 however the use of wastewater such as palm oil mill effluent pome may face some difficulties since the colour of the pome itself can affect the absorbance reading during testing of the flocculating activity of the bioflocculant produced 66 hence cultivation using cultivation a substrate made from wastewater with a high turbidity and colour requires pre treatment or dilution in order to omit absorbance disturbances and to obtain the optimal cultivation medium for bioflocculant production in addition dilution of the wastewater is also required to control the substrate concentration that exists in wastewater aljuboori et al 65 used a series of pome concentrations to produce pm 5 bioflocculant from aspergillus niger they found that the substrate concentration does have a significant impact on the bioflocculant production beyond those of the culture operating parameters parameters such as the c n ratio inoculum size metal ions cultivation period dissolved oxygen do ph and temperature are culture operating parameters that need to be taken into serious consideration when dealing with real wastewater as the cultivation medium 21 58 65 it can also be said that each microorganism has its own optimal conditions for producing a high yield bioflocculant with high flocculating activity 3 3 flocculating activity once the selection of bacteria and cultivation in media is done the determination of the flocculating activity will take place by the standard kaolin suspension method applying eq 1 69 1 flocculating activity fa b a b 100 here a is defined as the absorbance of the sample at 550 nm and b is defined as the absorbance of the control at the same wavelength the flocculating activity of the bioflocculant could be influenced by the dose used molecular weight ph temperature and metal ions 13 60 among all factors the bioflocculant dosage can greatly influence flocculating activity this is because polysaccharide based bioflocculants are often stable under heating and are able to show flocculating activity within a wide range of ph values and temperatures 13 in discussing the effects of the dosage used for example lower doses of bioflocculants may be insufficient for the adsorption of kaolin clay particles during the flocculating activity test while doses that are too high can cause a repulsive force to build up between the kaolin clay particles and bioflocculant 13 60 furthermore from the flocculating activity test a flocculating activity curve can be constructed based on the flocculating activity value obtained and dose amount used 69 this will eventually allow the optimization of parameters to be carried out according to the flocculating activity of the targeted bacteria species or consortium metal ions are also believed to affect the flocculating activity of bioflocculants this is because the addition of cations decreases the negative ions in kaolin particles and biopolymer flocculants monovalent and divalent cations are reported to help increase the flocculating activity of the bioflocculants produced while trivalent cations cause decreases of flocculating activity in terms of both floc formation and the optical density percentage 78 sodium chloride nacl is an example of a monovalent cation that can be added during the flocculating activity assay calcium chloride cacl2 magnesium chloride mgcl2 and aluminium chloride alcl3 are examples of divalent and trivalent cations respectively a study by zulkeflee et al 78 on bioflocculant production from bacillus sp reported that the addition of alcl3 during the flocculating activity assay only resulted in a 34 8 fa compared to the 70 5 fa in the control set this shows that the trivalent cation failed to neutralize the zeta potential in the kaolin suspension thus there was no attraction between the kaolin particles and the bioflocculant polymer despite this finding okaiyeto et al 56 reported that no addition of cations was needed in the flocculating activity assay for a bioflocculant produced from chryserbacterium daeguense and bacillus sp f19 although flocculating activity can still be observed within wide range of ph values and temperatures these factors can still affect the overall flocculating activity of the bioflocculant produced for example the ph value of the solution determines the flocculating activity and affects the stability of the suspended particles and floc formation 56 in addition variations in the ph value cause differences in the electrostatic charge of the bioflocculant and suspended particles thus affecting the bridging efficiency for kaolin clay particles 56 highly acidic conditions ph values 5 and highly alkaline conditions ph values 9 decreased flocculation activity 70 of bioflocculant produced by bacillus salmalaya with optimum ph occurred at 7 0 2 52 3 4 extraction and purification the final step in the production of a bioflocculant is the purification of the bioflocculant after the extraction of the bioflocculant is carried out the extraction methods for bioflocculants are usually unique and diverse in application depending on the type of bioflocculant sources and the expected yield the extraction methods often applied in bioflocculant production include the water extraction method ethanol extraction hydrothermal and microwave extraction and centrifugation afterwards the purification of the bioflocculant is conducted the bioflocculant produced is often lyophilized and vacuum dried 23 62 prior to further processing to obtain the crude bioflocculant to avoid deterioration of the organic polymeric content of the bioflocculant 4 extraction of bioflocculants the extraction methods for bioflocculants often vary according to the type of bioflocculant producers and yield due to these variations there are many possible methods to be utilized in bioflocculant extraction there are two distinct extraction methods that are frequently applied which are physical and chemical methods as shown in fig 3 centrifugation filtration sonication and heating are classified as physical extraction methods meanwhile alkaline acid treatment cation exchange resin solvent extraction ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid edta treatment and enzymatic treatment are examples of chemical extraction methods the selection of extraction methods plays a vital role in bioflocculant production because the extraction methods not only determine the yield of the produced bioflocculants but also define the cost of bioflocculants production 79 the type of eps lb eps or tb eps eventually affect the selection of extraction methods to be used for lb eps centrifugation at a high speed low temperature heating and high shear rate processes are more suitable since the eps is easily extracted from the respective mixture meanwhile the extraction of tb eps needs more extreme techniques such as heating at high temperatures sonication and chemical methods 13 these extraction methods are called conventional extraction methods and are applicable not only to microorganism bioflocculants but also to plant based bioflocculants therefore more advanced methods such as enzyme treatment and microwave assisted techniques are now receiving attention due to their ability to preserve the polysaccharides during the extraction process the next section of this paper emphasise the methods used for bioflocculants extraction 4 1 solvent extraction solvent extraction methods are frequently used in the extraction of either plant based or microorganism based bioflocculants solvent extraction methods are known as the main conventional extraction techniques and use one or combination of two different solvents they are often called liquid liquid extractions and use mainly water as the primary solvent with an organic solution such as hexane dichloromethane of ethanol as the secondary solvent 80 81 additionally solid liquid separation can be used to extract dissolved or suspended extractants in the respective mixture by applying special treatments especially heat and high speed mixing 81 however in the extraction of bioflocculants not all extraction techniques can be applied due to unsuitability of the solvents and external forces applied basically solvent extraction involves the following steps 1 the solvent penetrates into the matrix of substances 2 the solvent dissolves the solute 3 the solute diffuses from the solid matrix and 4 the extracted solute is collected 82 zhang et al 82 reported that a solvent extraction is often influenced by the temperature extraction time and solvent to solid ratio high temperatures during the extraction process will promote the solubility and diffusion rate however a temperature that is too high can decompose thermo sensitive materials and case solvent loss increases in the extraction time will eventually increase the bioflocculant yield until extraction equilibrium is reached therefore it is important to determine the optimum extraction time to avoid lost time high bioflocculant yields can be achieved at high solvent to solid ratios however using too much solvent can be wasteful and not cost effective in the extraction of bioflocculants table 3 lists the extraction techniques applied in bioflocculants production from the list it can be observed that solvent extraction often uses water ethanol and salt solutions especially cetylpyridinium chloride solution cpc and sodium chloride nacl as well as acid and alkali solvents such as hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh 4 1 1 water extraction method the water extraction method is one of the most commonly applied methods wherein water is used as the extraction medium or solvent water extraction methods can be carried out either with or without heat however the involvement of heat was observed to be able to assist in the extraction procedure of bioflocculant as increases in temperature are able to reduce the viscosity of the solvent and enhance the penetration between the solvent and cell thus leading to rapid mass transfer of water soluble active compounds into the extraction medium 83 92 in addition the application of heat decreases the van der waals forces and hydrogen bonding 93 thus enhancing the solubility between the solvent and cells however the value of the temperature applied in bioflocculant extraction may differ according to the source of the bioflocculant the extraction of bioflocculants from microorganisms for example normally uses temperatures less than 70 c to avoid cell lysis zhou et al 93 found that as the temperature exceeded 70 c significant evidence of cell lysis and the release of intracellular soluble organic materials was detected lee et al 83 studied the extraction of bioflocculants form okra and chinese yams and applied a water extraction method with an additional incubation period 90 c 30 min while tsuge et al 77 carried out a water extraction method without an additional incubation period in the study by tsuge et al 77 on bioflocculant production from activated sludge they initially centrifuged the activated sludge at 5 000 rpm for 20 min before suspending the concentrated activated sludge in 300 ml distilled water and mechanically stirring at 4 c for 30 min centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 30 min was carried out afterwards to obtain the supernatant before lyophilization and storage at 4 c the flocculating activity obtained was 24 6 with an extraction yield of 20 83 in contrast in the study carried out by lee et al 83 plant materials were ground to break the cell walls and enhance the solubility and were mixed with 100 ml of deionized water before placement in a shaker bath at 300 rpm for 3 h the extract was then incubated at 90 c for 30 min and left at room temperature for another hour to complete the extraction process then the bioflocculant was obtained by filtration and centrifugation at 7 000 rpm for 20 min before oven or freeze drying the product for storage at 4 c the yield gained was 74 2 thus the extraction processes of bioflocculants using water extraction methods may be different depending on the sample condition 4 1 2 ethanol extraction method ethanol extraction methods have the ability to separate water and lipo soluble components 91 retrieving bioflocculants via ethanol extraction methods can extend the lifetime of the extraction solution compared to water extraction methods wu et al 86 for instance utilized an ethanol extraction method to extract a bioflocculant from bacillus thuringiensis first the solution containing the bioflocculant was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min a volume of ethanol was then added to the supernatant collected and mixed thoroughly before centrifuging again at 5000 rpm for 15 min at room temperature for solid liquid separation purposes afterwards the flocculant precipitate was washed with a suitable volume of deionized sterile water and soaked again with ethanol two more times the extracted flocculants were then freeze dried weighed sealed and stored at a temperature below 20 c the flocculating activity obtained by wu et al 86 was 93 8 ayangbenro et al 27 also utilized an ethanol extraction in their study to retrieve bioflocculants from pantoea sp and p koreensis they centrifuged the fermentation broth at 3000 rpm for 30 min at 15 c before mixing the supernatant with cold ethanol 1 4 v v for bioflocculant precipitation and kept the mixture at 4 c for 16 h afterwards the mixture was again centrifuged 1000 rpm 30 min 15 c for precipitate collection prior to dissolving the precipitate in distilled water 1 4 v v and lyophilization the maximum yields gained for pantoea sp and p koreensis were 2 98 g l 1 fa 71 and 3 26 g l 1 fa 51 respectively in the study by karthiga and natarajan 88 ethanol acetone and methanol were used to extract bioflocculants from bacillus licheniformis and bacillus firmus by using double the volume of cold solvent ethanol acetone and methanol 1 2 v v extraction using ethanol as the extraction solvent yielded the highest amounts of bioflocculants from bacillus licheniformis and bacillus firmus compared to acetone and methanol respectively this shows that ethanol is more compatible for use in the extraction of bioflocculants from microorganisms compared to other organic solvents furthermore it was noticeable that the ethanol extraction method usually required two centrifugation processes 1 for solid liquid separation and 2 for the collection of the precipitate formed crude bioflocculant in contrast to the water extraction method this was because ethanol extraction methods are normally applied when retrieving bioflocculants from both lb eps and tb eps which require extra solvent solubility 92 in the absence of heat 4 1 3 salt solution extraction salt solutions such as sodium chloride nacl potassium chloride kcl and cetylpyridinium chloride cpc solutions have also been applied in the extraction of bioflocculants the extraction of bioflocculants using water is said to be the most accepted technique yet extractions using salt solutions are viewed as more efficient compared to water extractions 94 a study by madrona et al 95 found that there were significant effects from the salt solution concentration on the performance of the extracted bioflocculant in their study the extraction of a bioflocculant from moringa oleifera revealed that extraction using 1 m kcl was far more effective 99 7 turbidity removal compared to 0 1 m and 0 01 m kcl in real applications in producing drinking water they claimed that a high concentration of the salt solution was more effective in extracting the active compound in the bioflocculant which was a protein that led to a higher flocculating activity elkady et al 89 used cpc to extract a bioflocculant from bacillus mojavensis strain 3a with a flocculating activity of 96 1 and a yield of 5 2 g l 1 the cell free supernatant of the respective strain was concentrated to 0 2 vol using a rotary evaporator and left to dialyze overnight at 4 c in deionized water afterward three volumes of cold anhydrous ethanol at 4 c were mixed into the mixture for precipitation the precipitate formed was then dissolved again in deionized water followed by stirring with 10 cpc in the solution centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 15 min was applied to collect the precipitate prior to dissolving in 0 5 m nacl later three volumes of cold anhydrous ethanol 4 c were added for precipitation before washing with 75 ethanol three times lyophilization and storage for further use additionally aljuboori et al 58 also used cpc 50 ml of 2 cpc in their study to extract a bioflocculant from aspergillus flavus yield 0 4 g l 1 fa 87 2 with the precipitate collected by dissolving it in 100 ml of 0 5 m nacl and washing with two volumes of cold ethanol 4 1 4 acid and alkali extraction acid and alkali solutions are also frequently used for the extraction of bioflocculants in the study by zhang et al 76 on producing bioflocculants from biological sludge a combination of acid and alkali solutions was applied first 60 ml of 3 w w of hcl was used on sludge that was formerly treated with 100 ml of 4 w w naoh and the mixture was mixed with a magnetic stirrer at 400 rpm for 15 min afterward the mixture was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min and filtered with 3 μm filter paper the supernatant was then diluted with 150 ml of deionized water and the ph was adjusted to 1 before treatment with 4 w w naoh to increase the ph of the mixture followed by centrifuging at 8000 rpm for 15 min the best flocculating fa recorded was 96 in another study by guo and ma 90 they combined an alkali solution and thermal treatment alt to extract a bioflocculant from rhodococcus erythropolis fa 94 5 in the treatment the ph value of the sample was adjusted to ph 10 using 1 0 mol l 1 naoh at room temperature prior to autoclaving at 121 c for 30 min hcl was also used by sun et al 91 to extract a bioflocculant fa 99 5 from sludge due to the ability of hcl to extract flocculation active ingredients effectively they suspended the sludge in hcl 18 w w and stirred the mixture at 500 rpm for 15 min afterwards the suspension was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min to remove the sediment in addition to a high extraction efficiency it is also important to note that extraction using acid and alkali solutions at high concentrations may cause denaturalization of the bioflocculant itself 96 4 2 ultrasound assisted extraction ultrasound assisted extraction uae is often called sonication and is applied in extraction methods to create cavitation that allow bubbles to form during the sonication process the cavitation that holds the bubbles will become pressurized and implosion will occur thus creating a high temperature and pressure microenvironment and accelerating the extraction process 81 annegowda et al 97 claimed that sonication was able to reduce the processing period while consuming less energy and being environmentally friendly in addition to cost effective simple and reliable moreover sonication can also be used in the extraction of inorganic or organic substances in either the solid or liquid state 81 however it is best if the solvents used in uae are acidic or organic solvents with low viscosities and surface tensions to avoid the hindrance of cavitation 98 moreover ultrasonic baths and probe units are two devices that are usually used in the application of ultrasound in the extraction process 99 a study by li et al 100 used ultrasonic treatment for cell disruption prior to the sonication treatment the fermented broth was filtered using a 0 22 μm filter collected and resuspended in deionized water for the ultrasonication process ultrasonication was carried out at 200 250 and 300 w and 20 khz for 20 min the temperature was set below 20 c to avoid the deterioration of thermo sensitive components of the bioflocculant however it was observed that for cell disruption in plants ultrasonication often uses frequencies greater than 20 khz ramandi et al 99 used 40 khz in an ultrasonic water bath with hexane as the extracting solvent at 48 c for 30 min the temperature can be optimised in the uae where it should not exceed the boiling point of the extracting solvent the effectiveness of uae in increasing the extraction efficiency is also supported by liu et al 96 who used low frequency ultrasound 80 w 10 min in an ice bath to pre treating sludge before applying a solvent extraction technique 4 3 hydrothermal and microwave assisted extraction hydrothermal and microwave assisted extraction methods mae are considered advanced and modern extraction techniques hydrothermal extraction utilizes water bath accompanied with rigorous agitation and heating processes this technique requires high temperature above 70 c with a long extraction time minimum of 30 min with average of 2 h extraction was occurred via heat transfer from the heating medium in water bath to the extraction vessel transferred heat then perform external evaporation of solvent and internal evaporation inside compound s matrix to produce solid compounds 79 this method is currently widely applied while energy consumption from high temperature requirement and the long period of extraction become several considerations to seek for an optional method the mae uses discrete heating mechanisms that result in lower extraction times compared to conventional hydrothermal extraction methods using water and ethanol 79 additionally mae techniques also require smaller equipment sizes and are much simpler compared to conventional extraction methods 101 commercially there are two types of mae systems namely closed extraction vessels and focused microwave ovens 102 in microwave extraction methods the selection of the solvent is crucial since microwaves work best in solvents that possess high dielectric or polar properties such as water and organic solvents 79 82 zhang et al 82 reported that mae can be carried out in two ways which are solvent free extraction often applied for volatile compounds and solvent extraction often applied for non volatile compounds the existence of heat in the extraction process does increase the yield of the extraction product however in mae processes the temperature must be controlled to not surpass the optimum temperature water solvent 50 60 c alcohol based solvent 79 90 c because high microwave power and extraction temperatures can cause thermal degradation of the active constituents thus leading to a low extraction yield 79 in the implementation of mae in the extraction of a bioflocculant from okra by lee et al 101 they used sliced okra and deionized water which were exposed to a microwave heating system operated at 2450 mhz since no heating occurred when the frequency was lower or greater than 2450 mhz 102 after treatment with microwaves the mixture was left for 1 h for cooling and the complete release of the extractants into water the supernatant was collected via centrifugation 4000 rpm 30 min before drying at 105 c until a constant mass was achieved the yield obtained was 53 under 90 c heating 4 4 enzyme assisted extraction enzyme assisted extraction eae is considered an advanced extraction method with advantages such as efficiency eco friendliness sustainability selectivity and specificity according to the desired extractant 103 according to nadar et al 103 extraction via eae can eliminate the excess usage of hazardous solvents and is suitable for thermo sensitive products since the application of eae is carried out under controlled temperatures with higher production yields in the extraction of a polysaccharide bioflocculant from astragalus membranaceus using seven types of enzymes amyloglucosidade hemicellulose glucose oxidase bacterial amylase fungal amylase pectinase and cellulose the amounts of enzymes used were in the range of 0 5 5 5 at 30 70 c temperatures for 1 7 days of reaction time and ph values ranging from 3 5 13 0 104 in the study by chen et al 104 the selection of enzyme was conducted using response surface methodology with the highest extraction yield as the indicator of the optimal enzyme optimising the extraction conditions enzyme ratio temperature ph and reaction time is interesting and useful for the application of this technique in future 105 106 the extraction was further continued by ultrasonic treatment for 30 min the precipitation of the desired product was achieved by adding 95 ethanol for 36 h at 4 c and the product collected via centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 15 min before lyophilization to obtain the crude product based on the study by chen et al 104 the types of enzymes used during extraction process play a vital role in determining the yield of the desired product in addition to the amounts of enzymes applied this is because using too little enzymes causes incomplete enzyme treatment and using too much is not cost effective 103 moreover the effect of the ph and temperature in performing eae cannot be neglected since both factors play specific roles for every enzyme used most enzymes have an optimum ph value within the range of the isoelectric ph of proteins 103 and work best at temperatures ranging from 30 to 55 c 104 the application of eae beyond these temperatures will eventually result in a lower yield of the desired product due to the loss of enzyme activities 103 104 5 purification of bioflocculants the final step in the production of a bioflocculant is purification the purification step is necessary to extract the active coagulating agents and eliminate the undesired substances from the extracted bioflocculant 94 the purification of bioflocculants can be carried out thorough lyophilisation chromatography and dialysis as summarised in fig 4 agunbiade et al 50 adopted lyophilisation to obtain the purified bioflocculant however before the lyophilisation steps were carried out they dissolved the crude bioflocculant in water before a volume of chloroform and n butyl alcohol 5 2 v v mixture was added afterwards the mixture was stirred thoroughly poured into a separating funnel and left for 12 h at room temperature after the supernatant was removed two volumes of ethanol were added for bioflocculant precipitation before lyophilisation took place fujita et al 107 used chromatography in an aqueous solution to obtain a purified bioflocculant approximately 10 mm phosphate buffer was used to adjust the ph of the crude bioflocculant to ph 5 before application to a gigapite amphoteric column seikagaku kogyo co tokyo 3 2 cm 18 cm with the same buffer used flowrate of 28 ml h 1 the bioflocculant was further purified through subjection to a sephadex 200hr column pharmacia co sweden 3 2 cm 120 cm before elution by 10 mm phosphate buffer at flowrate of 8 2 ml h 1 mu et al 108 also used chromatography to purify bioflocculants with some modifications for double purification using chromatography first they resuspended the bioflocculant in 3 ml deionized water and loaded it onto an anion exchange chromatography column of deae 52 cellulose 1 5 50 cm sodium chloride nacl was used to remove the absorbed substance at flow rate of 1 ml min 1 and the eluent was collected and loaded onto a sephadex g 100 for gel permeation chromatography 1 5 50 cm with deionized water used to elute the mixture before the lyophilisation step to yield a pure fraction of bioflocculant on the other hand karthiga and natarajan 88 utilized vacuum drying and dialysis to purify a bioflocculant the bioflocculant was hydrated for 2 h in order to eliminate all water and solvent using a rotary evaporator prior to dialysis against distilled water the mixture was then kept overnight at 4 c until further use vacuum drying was also utilized in the study by sun et al 91 however they used 40 ml of cold ethanol and adjusted the mixture to ph 8 using 1 w w naoh with continuous stirring with the mixture kept at 4 c for precipitation to occur the precipitate was then collected centrifuged at rpm for 15 minutes15 min washed with distilled water evaporated for 2 h in a rotary evaporator and vacuum dried for 12 h 6 scaling up challenges of bioflocculant production although most studies have reported the effectiveness of bioflocculants in water and wastewater treatment most of this research was carried out at the laboratory scale and is not widely applicable in real wastewater treatment plants wwtps the development and application of bioflocculants at the industrial scale is observed to be restricted due to the sensitivity of the products to the preparation process moderate flocculating efficiencies 62 easy degradability over time and higher production cost bukahri et al 2020 especially downstream costs extraction and purification compared to commercial flocculants 9 salehizadeh et al 13 reported that the production of bioflocculants through microbial bioprocesses is high cost in terms of carbon sources 85 and the huge amount of solvents required during the extraction and purification processes make them consequently hard to scale up commercially the production of bioflocculants from mixtures of microorganisms on the other hand is quite difficult to understand since the bioflocculants produced are also complex in form and their functional molecules have not yet been thoroughly studied 108 additionally the production of bioflocculant from natural resources might also yield a proportion of ineffective ingredients for flocculation thus affecting the overall production cost due to the requirement of eliminating the ineffective ingredients 108 moreover conflict in deciding the most suitable bioflocculant with which to treat wastewater may arise since the characteristics of the produced bioflocculants often vary according to the bacterial species and carbon and nutrient sources in addition to challenges from the production of bioflocculant itself the application of bioflocculants in wastewater treatment may be inappropriate due to the extreme ph values and concentrations of wastewater 94 optimal operating parameters such as the dosage of the bioflocculant are also required to ensure that maximum flocculation is achieved thus failure to maintain the optimum dosage of the bioflocculant will result in minimal removal efficiency in wastewater treatment 50 7 conclusion bioflocculants utilisation poses promising efficiency for water and wastewater treatment bioflocculants produced from microorganisms or plants must go through a downstream process to be used in real applications the extraction steps are considered the most crucial steps since these steps will determine the quality and the yield of the bioflocculant production solvent extraction ultrasound assisted extraction uae hydrothermal microwave assisted extraction mae and enzyme assisted extraction eae are several methods to be used in bioflocculant extraction while solvent extraction considered to be the most convenient technique as compared other techniques lyophilisation chromatography and dialysis have been successfully applied in bioflocculant purification the difficulties and challenges especially in terms of extraction cost are still main issues in bioflocculant production therefore cheap yet effective extraction techniques need to be thoroughly investigated determination of appropriate method and optimisation of bioflocculant production conditions are suggested to be conducted in future to enrich and strengthen this research topic real scale application of bioflocculant in water and wastewater treatment plant is currently considered as inappropriate due to the cost while deep analysis including the sludge handling cost is yet to be conducted utilisation of bioflocculant will produce biodegradable sludge which reduce the sludge handling cost and having potential for further utilisation as compared to the handling of non biodegradable or hazardous sludge declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

13616,the utilisation of chemical flocculants in water and wastewater treatment has drawn several concerns especially in terms of further toxicity and its effect to the environment the utilisation of chemical flocculants produces non biodegradable and hazardous sludge as by product of the treatment bioflocculants are observed as an alternative to chemical flocculants due to their comparable efficiencies they are biodegradable eco friendly and safe to handle the identification and production of novel bioflocculants has gained much attention worldwide and extensively reported amongst all bacteria receive the most attention because of its availability and ability to produce bioflocculants with many specialties this review paper summarises the extraction and purification processes in bioflocculant production as vital aspect that determine the production yield which is currently still scattered solvent extraction ultrasound assisted extraction hydrothermal microwave assisted and enzyme assisted are examples of extraction techniques while lyophilisation ion exchange and dialysis are the purification techniques often adopted in bioflocculant production this review paper also provides brief introduction on plant crustacean and microorganism based bioflocculant as promising compounds with high flocculating activity the development of bioflocculants is representing important progress in sustainable environmental technology the need to provide a selection of inexpensive promising extraction and purification techniques for bioflocculant production are the challenges for bioflocculant production and future research directions on this subject should be emphasized to be applied further in water and wastewater treatment keywords bio based polymeric flocculant bioflocculant bioflocculant extraction bioflocculant purification bacteria producing bioflocculant 1 introduction wastewater produced by industries through food and beverage production mining dyes and textiles fermentation and its downstream processes palm oil mill effluent pulp mill sanitary landfill leachates and others contain very fine suspended solids dissolved solids inorganic particles organic particles metals and other impurities 1 4 solids particles in wastewater can affect the environment by decreasing the light penetration in surface water and affecting the fish gill 5 6 while organic materials can decrease oxygen availability which can harm aquatic organisms 7 8 however because of its very fine and subtle characteristics it is very hard to directly remove these contaminants from wastewater thus the task of bringing the particles closer and making them heavier is necessary for settling purposes 9 10 coagulants and flocculants are applied to allow particles or pollutants that are light fine and subtle to coagulate and flocculate to form larger particle sizes by neutralizing the charges on the particles 11 12 this condition allows the particles to separate from the water body and to sediment at the base of the tank due to the flocs higher density than that of water 13 the flocculation performance depends on the choice of flocculants used with turbidity removal residual turbidity sludge volume and settling rate become the parameters to define the overall performance the settling rate of particles depends on the particle size formed through the coagulation and flocculation processes 11 14 in other words larger particle sizes with higher densities will lead to higher settling rates and a better supernatant quality as a consequence the easy removal of particles is achieved since they are already physically separated from the wastewater water and wastewater can be treated using various technologies such as physico chemical treatments coagulation flocculation precipitation conventional chemical oxidation and advanced oxidation and biological treatments activated sludge process integrated fixed film activated sludge submerged aerobic attached growth and emerging biofilm process wastewater treatment using coagulants flocculants is relatively simple having competitive cost with other treatment method and able to separate various pollutants such as particles dyes and heavy metals 14 15 according to okaiyeto et al 14 flocculation can be used as a substitute for filtration and centrifugation to separate microbial cells from broth in the food beverage and pharmaceutical industries however despite its high efficiency in wastewater treatment the flocculation process can produce small and fragile flocs that can easily be dishevelled when physical force is applied 14 therefore it is crucial to ensure that the flocs formed are sturdy and heavy enough for the separation process to occur before choosing suitable flocculants it is important to have information about flocculant classifications the flocculants must have zero or minimum hazardous impacts to human health and the environment 16 generally flocculants can be divided into inorganic and polymeric categories polymeric flocculants can be further divided into three groups namely synthetic grafted and bio based polymers 15 as illustrated in fig 1 the use of inorganic or metal salts derived flocculants are common in industrial wastewater treatment 17 ferric sulphate ferric chloride aluminium sulphate 18 aluminium chloride and titanium chloride 19 are examples of inorganic flocculants that are frequently used in the treatment of industrial wastewater the term of synthetic polymeric flocculants refers to chemical based polymeric flocculants that are frequently used as an alternative to inorganic flocculants polyethyleneimine pei polyaluminium chloride pac and polyacrylamide pam polymers are examples of synthetic polymeric flocculants on the other hand grafted flocculants are a class of polymeric flocculants that combine natural and synthetic polymers and sometimes more with the aim of gaining the advantages of synthetic and natural polymers simultaneously 20 meanwhile bio based polymeric flocculants or bioflocculants are those synthesized naturally by either plants or microorganisms examples of bioflocculants from plants are usually derived from beans moringa maize and cactus while examples of bioflocculants from microorganisms are derived from actinomycetes fungi bacteria and algae 21 both inorganic and polymeric flocculants are excellent in terms of performance but the excessive use of these compounds pose several concerns including the trigger of alzheimer s disease cancer and neurotoxicity to human 22 23 inorganic and synthetic flocculants are not biodegradable 15 21 22 thus sludge produced as by product of treatment using these compounds is also non biodegradable for this reason bioflocculants derived from microorganisms have emerged as the most suitable candidates to be explored bioflocculants has been proven as nontoxic and eco friendly behavior towards human and environment 16 24 to date many researchers have reported on bioflocculant production by microorganisms such as aspergillus parasiticus 25 ochrobacterium cicero w2 26 bacillus mojavensis 21 pseudomonas koreensis pantoea sp 27 pseudomonas sp hp2 28 enterococcus faecalis proteus mirabilis lysinibacillus sp 29 bacillus velezensis 30 and many more the methods of extraction and purification are different and specific in each study while information related to the production of bioflocculant compounds is currently still scattered thus causing complexity in full scale production the downstream processes in microorganism based bioflocculant production are crucial to obtain a bigger yield and high quality bioflocculant databases analysis including elsevier www sciencedirect com springer www springerlink com wiley www wiley com researchgate www researchgate net and google scholar was implemented using key words such as flocculation and coagulation wastewater treatment technology bioflocculant extraction bioflocculant purification bacteria bioflocculant and bioflocculant productions there were about 100 papers selected from the year 2000 2020 and 80 research papers from 2015 to 2020 indicated that the bioflocculant production applied various unique methods which rarely summarized in a review paper therefore this paper aims to cover and deeply discuss the production extraction and purification methods for bioflocculant derived from potentially flocculant producing organisms utilisation of wastewater as potential medium in the production of bioflocculant by microorganism are highlighted in this review paper comparison of several extraction and purification methods are presented for the basic reference in selecting appropriate method to obtain the optimum production yield the difficulties and challenges of bioflocculant production and application were also discussed to direct for future research and opportunities of applications in real wastewater treatment plants for various industries 2 bio based flocculant 2 1 plant and crustacean based flocculants bio based flocculants are known as bioflocculants and are extracted either from naturally occurring bioflocculants such as marine polysaccharide flocculants sodium alginate and chitosan and microbial flocculants or are produced from renewable sources such as plants seeds and vegetable tannin and eggshells 31 alginate is an anionic polysaccharide consisting of 1 4 linked β d mannuronate m block and α l guluronate g block residues with biodegradable biocompatible non toxic and non immunogenic biopolymer polyelectrolyte characteristics that is often extracted from seaweed 13 chitosan is a polysaccharide made up of n acetylglucosamine glcnac and or glucosamine glcn linked through β 1 4 glycosidic linkages produced from the exoskeletons of crustaceans such as crabs shrimps prawns lobster and krill and it has biocompatible biodegradable and antimicrobial activity properties 32 similar to alginate pectin is a complex anionic polysaccharide composed of β 1 4 linked d galacturonic acid residues found in plants that is able to form a gel with divalent cations to help in the flocculation and coagulation processes 33 in addition to crustaceans plants also have potential as sources of bioflocculants including okra cassava roots pomelo peel guar gum and bamboo 13 34 table 1 summarizes the types of bioflocculants which are divided into marine plant crustacean and plant categories marine plants such as ascophyllum nodosum durvillaea antartica laminaria digitata macrocyctis pyrifera and sargassum sp are types of brown seaweeds from which alginate is extracted as shown in the table there are many applications of alginate especially in the remediation of wastewater from the pharmaceutical cosmetic food and biotechnology industries 13 35 as well as the removal of heavy metals 36 chitosan is extracted from crustaceans such as metapenaeus monoceros penaeus longirostris and chionoecetes opilio the extracted chitosan can be applied to remove heavy metals particles dissolved organic matter 38 and in the removal of solid suspensions from food processing waste 39 on the other hand bioflocculants from plants such cassia angustifolia have been used to remove colour from dye solutions 42 49 ummalyma et al 45 reported that guar gum guaran can be used in microalgae biomass harvesting despite being biodegradable and safe for application plant based bioflocculants are still lacking in flocculating activity therefore they are often grafted onto other polymers such as pam to promote the flocculating activities of the respective bioflocculants 2 2 microorganism based flocculants another promising category of substitutes for chemical flocculants is microorganism based flocculants microorganism based flocculants are known as biotechnological tools for use in wastewater treatment through the bioflocculation process 50 which are much safer and have higher biodegradable ability 47 compared to synthetic chemical flocculants these bioflocculants are metabolites secreted by microorganisms during their growth phase 51 they can be produced by bacteria fungi microalgae and actinomycetes the first report of bioflocculants was made by louis pasteur in 1876 using yeast as the bioflocculant producer 52 bioflocculants derived from microorganisms are easily isolated optimised and characterised 52 53 the selection of microorganisms for microbial bioflocculants is often based on their morphology and ability to produce slimy extracellular polysaccharides eps 21 54 eps which is naturally adhesive and cohesive helps in the aggregation of suspended solids wastewater 55 according to shahadat et al 16 there are two types of eps namely loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps according to rebah et al 21 in the polymer characterization of bioflocculants variations are observed especially in the composition of polysaccharides proteins dna cellulose sugar and polyamino acids during the growth phase of microorganisms however the concern only focuses on the composition of polysaccharides and proteins since these substances make up the highest percentage of the bioflocculant polymer 29 and indirectly affect the flocculating activity of the bioflocculant to clearly observe the relationship between the composition of polysaccharides and proteins and the flocculating activity previous studies on bioflocculant production from microorganisms especially bacteria are tabulated in table 2 from table 2 it can be observed that the compositions of polysaccharides ps and proteins p were different in each bioflocculant producing strain bioflocculant polymers with a high composition of polysaccharides 80 managed to achieve high flocculating activities fa 90 vimala et al 29 found that the structures of polysaccharide functional groups carboxyl hydroxyl amino and phosphate groups can affect the flocculating activity of bioflocculants a similar finding was also reported by nwodo et al 23 in which hydroxyl carboxyl and amino sugars which are constituents of polysaccharides were found to be able to enhance the flocculating activity of the bioflocculant therefore in the search for bioflocculants with high flocculating activities the presence of functional groups on the polysaccharides needs to be highly considered vimala et al 29 also added that bioflocculants with high compositions of polysaccharides were thermally stable while bioflocculants with high compositions of proteins were thermally sensitive this knowledge is especially helpful in the application of bioflocculants in wastewater treatment based on table 2 the types of carbon sources used were also different and were categorized into defined and complex media media with known ingredients were called defined media whereas media with undetermined chemical compositions were called complex media the complex media tabulated in table 2 normally comes from various types of industrial wastewater and were considered low cost carbon sources since the wastewater was available in abundance the search for low cost carbon sources has been widely covered by many researchers because the production of bioflocculants using defined media contributes to the high production cost palm oil mill effluent 30 65 66 potato starch wastewater 64 70 and dairy wastewater 67 68 72 are example of wastewater with potential as carbon sources for bioflocculant production from bacteria among all low cost carbon sources dairy wastewater shows the ability to produce bioflocculants with high flocculating activity 95 this is because dairy wastewater contains easily degradable carbohydrates lactose proteins and lipids 68 that are crucial for microbial growth the derivation of bioflocculants from bacteria can be performed using either single or mixed cultures 53 the cultivation of bacteria can be performed using carbon and nitrogen sources such as glucose and yeast extract respectively 21 in addition according to abdullah et al 53 and rebah et al 21 bioflocculants derived from cultivation via mixed culture are able to produce higher flocculating activity fa compared to those from single culture cultivation techniques bioflocculants produced from a mixture of streptomyces sp gansen and cellulomonas sp okoh managed to achieve a 98 9 fa 55 and a mixture of halobacillus sp mvuyo and oceanobacillus sp pinky achieved a 98 3 fa 57 however the fa of bioflocculants from single strains are also on a par with those of bioflocculants produced from mixed cultures bacillus sp teri vb2 and pseudomonas sp hp2 managed to achieve 99 and 99 2 fa 55 63 respectively pseudomas sp hp2 managed to record the highest fa among all strains in addition to bacillus velezensis 40b 98 fa bacillus licheniformis x14 98 fa 21 and paenibacillus mucilaginosus 97 fa 62 also showed promising performances bacillus sp is the most studied bacterial species for bioflocculant production this finding is in agreement with lachhwani 11 who labelled bacillus sp 101 as capable of producing flocculating substances with good flocculating activity despite different carbon and nitrogen sources microorganisms from the class bacilli also capable of producing higher quantities of extracellular polymeric substances eps with primary constituents of bioflocculants comparable to those of lactic acid bacteria lab and are the most widely reported 54 73 74 klebsiella sp are also capable of producing bioflocculants with flocculating activities of more than 80 according to yin et al 60 there are seven klebsiella sp capable of producing bioflocculants namely klebsiella sp strain s11 klebsiella pneumonia h12 klebsiella sp myc klebsiella mobilis klebsiella terrigena klebsiella pneumonia strain ny1 and klebsiella pneumonia strain mbf 5 aspergillus sp is also often reported by researchers due to the ability of the microorganism to produce high fa bioflocculants the filamentous characteristic of aspergillus sp allows them to entrap solid particles to form aggregates and strengthens the flocculation structure 75 3 process of microorganism based flocculants production generally to produce a bioflocculant there are several steps that must be followed as shown in fig 2 the steps involve the isolation of bioflocculant producing bacteria bpb the identification of bpb the growth of the bpb seed fermentation for bioflocculant production the determination of the flocculating activity and last the purification of the bioflocculant itself 3 1 isolation and identification the isolation of bpb can be done from various sources using common medium of nutrient broth for the isolation usually the isolated strain of bpb can be identified at the genus level by performing polymerase chain reaction pcr and sequencing 16s rna analyses to identify the taxonomic locus of the strain the sequencing data are then used to construct a phylogenetic tree to recognize the isolated bacteria lineage 63 according to rebah et al 21 sludge from aerobic activated sludge systems is often selected as origins for bacteria isolation for bioflocculation production purposes the reason for this process is that bioflocculation often reflects a dynamic process that occurs inside aerobic activated sludge systems thus the sludge from these systems contains significant numbers of bacteria that are able to produce bioflocculants for example an activated sludge sample from paper mill wastewater contained klebsiella sp zz 3 which has the ability to produce a bioflocculant 60 in addition zhang et al 76 solely used activated sludge obtained from a sewage plant to produce bioflocculant both processes show that activated sludge can be a good source either for the isolation of bacteria involved in bioflocculant production or for use as the sole source in production a later study by qi et al 28 used pseudomonas sp hp2 isolated from forest soil for bioflocculant production the bioflocculant produced managed to achieve a 92 5 fa streptomyces sp isolated from sediment showed the most promising performance with a 99 2 fa 63 which was the highest fa amongst all isolated strains therefore the isolation sources for bpb can be varied but are mostly concentrated in areas believed to be niches for bpb such as soil activated sludge and sediment after the source for isolation is chosen the microorganisms especially bacteria are then selected based on physical and chemical characteristics and chemo taxonomical characteristics physical characteristics that should be considered are the morphology of the bacteria and the existence of slimy eps upon cultivation on selected media this slimy eps contributes to flocculating activity in addition to assisting in the adherence of cells to a surface and acts as a source of energy for microbes during starvation 69 the chemical characteristics of bpb can be evaluated using congo red crystal violet and copper sulphate solution as well as chelating agents and colorimetric methods 21 3 2 growth and fermentation of bpb the next step in bioflocculant production is the growth and fermentation of bpb in the cultivation medium that is optimal for the bioflocculant yield there are two types of conditions in which a bioflocculant can exist first bioflocculant materials secreted into the production medium which can be easily obtained by filtration of the production medium second bioflocculant materials adhered to the cell or adsorbed to the cell surface require an extraction method to take place 77 as can be observed in table 2 the cultivation of bpb using defined media usually consists of carbon glucose sucrose and nitrogen urea yeast extract sources to support the growth of the bacteria the carbon source is very crucial for microbial growth however different carbon sources often lead to different efficiencies in bioflocculant production this could be because of different metabolic pathways involved during the utilisation of the carbon source by bpb which thus interfere with the eps production that is often related to the bioflocculant 73 however the cost to purchase such carbon and nitrogen sources can be problematic especially in the production of bioflocculants at a large scale therefore the quest for a cultivation substrate that is economical easily available and can support the optimal growth of bacteria is of huge concern 64 in addition rebah et al 21 also mentioned that wastewater and sludge contain sufficient macronutrients besides carbon nitrogen and phosphorus that can support the growth of microorganisms leading to bioflocculant production to achieve the aforementioned statement table 2 lists cost effective substrates that are capable of producing bioflocculants with promising flocculating activities wastewater which is abundantly available can be the best candidate as a substitute for the substrate frequently used in the production of bioflocculants dairy 67 68 72 and potato starch 64 70 wastewaters are the most effective cultivation substrates in the production of bioflocculants which each yield flocculating activities higher than 90 however the use of wastewater such as palm oil mill effluent pome may face some difficulties since the colour of the pome itself can affect the absorbance reading during testing of the flocculating activity of the bioflocculant produced 66 hence cultivation using cultivation a substrate made from wastewater with a high turbidity and colour requires pre treatment or dilution in order to omit absorbance disturbances and to obtain the optimal cultivation medium for bioflocculant production in addition dilution of the wastewater is also required to control the substrate concentration that exists in wastewater aljuboori et al 65 used a series of pome concentrations to produce pm 5 bioflocculant from aspergillus niger they found that the substrate concentration does have a significant impact on the bioflocculant production beyond those of the culture operating parameters parameters such as the c n ratio inoculum size metal ions cultivation period dissolved oxygen do ph and temperature are culture operating parameters that need to be taken into serious consideration when dealing with real wastewater as the cultivation medium 21 58 65 it can also be said that each microorganism has its own optimal conditions for producing a high yield bioflocculant with high flocculating activity 3 3 flocculating activity once the selection of bacteria and cultivation in media is done the determination of the flocculating activity will take place by the standard kaolin suspension method applying eq 1 69 1 flocculating activity fa b a b 100 here a is defined as the absorbance of the sample at 550 nm and b is defined as the absorbance of the control at the same wavelength the flocculating activity of the bioflocculant could be influenced by the dose used molecular weight ph temperature and metal ions 13 60 among all factors the bioflocculant dosage can greatly influence flocculating activity this is because polysaccharide based bioflocculants are often stable under heating and are able to show flocculating activity within a wide range of ph values and temperatures 13 in discussing the effects of the dosage used for example lower doses of bioflocculants may be insufficient for the adsorption of kaolin clay particles during the flocculating activity test while doses that are too high can cause a repulsive force to build up between the kaolin clay particles and bioflocculant 13 60 furthermore from the flocculating activity test a flocculating activity curve can be constructed based on the flocculating activity value obtained and dose amount used 69 this will eventually allow the optimization of parameters to be carried out according to the flocculating activity of the targeted bacteria species or consortium metal ions are also believed to affect the flocculating activity of bioflocculants this is because the addition of cations decreases the negative ions in kaolin particles and biopolymer flocculants monovalent and divalent cations are reported to help increase the flocculating activity of the bioflocculants produced while trivalent cations cause decreases of flocculating activity in terms of both floc formation and the optical density percentage 78 sodium chloride nacl is an example of a monovalent cation that can be added during the flocculating activity assay calcium chloride cacl2 magnesium chloride mgcl2 and aluminium chloride alcl3 are examples of divalent and trivalent cations respectively a study by zulkeflee et al 78 on bioflocculant production from bacillus sp reported that the addition of alcl3 during the flocculating activity assay only resulted in a 34 8 fa compared to the 70 5 fa in the control set this shows that the trivalent cation failed to neutralize the zeta potential in the kaolin suspension thus there was no attraction between the kaolin particles and the bioflocculant polymer despite this finding okaiyeto et al 56 reported that no addition of cations was needed in the flocculating activity assay for a bioflocculant produced from chryserbacterium daeguense and bacillus sp f19 although flocculating activity can still be observed within wide range of ph values and temperatures these factors can still affect the overall flocculating activity of the bioflocculant produced for example the ph value of the solution determines the flocculating activity and affects the stability of the suspended particles and floc formation 56 in addition variations in the ph value cause differences in the electrostatic charge of the bioflocculant and suspended particles thus affecting the bridging efficiency for kaolin clay particles 56 highly acidic conditions ph values 5 and highly alkaline conditions ph values 9 decreased flocculation activity 70 of bioflocculant produced by bacillus salmalaya with optimum ph occurred at 7 0 2 52 3 4 extraction and purification the final step in the production of a bioflocculant is the purification of the bioflocculant after the extraction of the bioflocculant is carried out the extraction methods for bioflocculants are usually unique and diverse in application depending on the type of bioflocculant sources and the expected yield the extraction methods often applied in bioflocculant production include the water extraction method ethanol extraction hydrothermal and microwave extraction and centrifugation afterwards the purification of the bioflocculant is conducted the bioflocculant produced is often lyophilized and vacuum dried 23 62 prior to further processing to obtain the crude bioflocculant to avoid deterioration of the organic polymeric content of the bioflocculant 4 extraction of bioflocculants the extraction methods for bioflocculants often vary according to the type of bioflocculant producers and yield due to these variations there are many possible methods to be utilized in bioflocculant extraction there are two distinct extraction methods that are frequently applied which are physical and chemical methods as shown in fig 3 centrifugation filtration sonication and heating are classified as physical extraction methods meanwhile alkaline acid treatment cation exchange resin solvent extraction ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid edta treatment and enzymatic treatment are examples of chemical extraction methods the selection of extraction methods plays a vital role in bioflocculant production because the extraction methods not only determine the yield of the produced bioflocculants but also define the cost of bioflocculants production 79 the type of eps lb eps or tb eps eventually affect the selection of extraction methods to be used for lb eps centrifugation at a high speed low temperature heating and high shear rate processes are more suitable since the eps is easily extracted from the respective mixture meanwhile the extraction of tb eps needs more extreme techniques such as heating at high temperatures sonication and chemical methods 13 these extraction methods are called conventional extraction methods and are applicable not only to microorganism bioflocculants but also to plant based bioflocculants therefore more advanced methods such as enzyme treatment and microwave assisted techniques are now receiving attention due to their ability to preserve the polysaccharides during the extraction process the next section of this paper emphasise the methods used for bioflocculants extraction 4 1 solvent extraction solvent extraction methods are frequently used in the extraction of either plant based or microorganism based bioflocculants solvent extraction methods are known as the main conventional extraction techniques and use one or combination of two different solvents they are often called liquid liquid extractions and use mainly water as the primary solvent with an organic solution such as hexane dichloromethane of ethanol as the secondary solvent 80 81 additionally solid liquid separation can be used to extract dissolved or suspended extractants in the respective mixture by applying special treatments especially heat and high speed mixing 81 however in the extraction of bioflocculants not all extraction techniques can be applied due to unsuitability of the solvents and external forces applied basically solvent extraction involves the following steps 1 the solvent penetrates into the matrix of substances 2 the solvent dissolves the solute 3 the solute diffuses from the solid matrix and 4 the extracted solute is collected 82 zhang et al 82 reported that a solvent extraction is often influenced by the temperature extraction time and solvent to solid ratio high temperatures during the extraction process will promote the solubility and diffusion rate however a temperature that is too high can decompose thermo sensitive materials and case solvent loss increases in the extraction time will eventually increase the bioflocculant yield until extraction equilibrium is reached therefore it is important to determine the optimum extraction time to avoid lost time high bioflocculant yields can be achieved at high solvent to solid ratios however using too much solvent can be wasteful and not cost effective in the extraction of bioflocculants table 3 lists the extraction techniques applied in bioflocculants production from the list it can be observed that solvent extraction often uses water ethanol and salt solutions especially cetylpyridinium chloride solution cpc and sodium chloride nacl as well as acid and alkali solvents such as hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh 4 1 1 water extraction method the water extraction method is one of the most commonly applied methods wherein water is used as the extraction medium or solvent water extraction methods can be carried out either with or without heat however the involvement of heat was observed to be able to assist in the extraction procedure of bioflocculant as increases in temperature are able to reduce the viscosity of the solvent and enhance the penetration between the solvent and cell thus leading to rapid mass transfer of water soluble active compounds into the extraction medium 83 92 in addition the application of heat decreases the van der waals forces and hydrogen bonding 93 thus enhancing the solubility between the solvent and cells however the value of the temperature applied in bioflocculant extraction may differ according to the source of the bioflocculant the extraction of bioflocculants from microorganisms for example normally uses temperatures less than 70 c to avoid cell lysis zhou et al 93 found that as the temperature exceeded 70 c significant evidence of cell lysis and the release of intracellular soluble organic materials was detected lee et al 83 studied the extraction of bioflocculants form okra and chinese yams and applied a water extraction method with an additional incubation period 90 c 30 min while tsuge et al 77 carried out a water extraction method without an additional incubation period in the study by tsuge et al 77 on bioflocculant production from activated sludge they initially centrifuged the activated sludge at 5 000 rpm for 20 min before suspending the concentrated activated sludge in 300 ml distilled water and mechanically stirring at 4 c for 30 min centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 30 min was carried out afterwards to obtain the supernatant before lyophilization and storage at 4 c the flocculating activity obtained was 24 6 with an extraction yield of 20 83 in contrast in the study carried out by lee et al 83 plant materials were ground to break the cell walls and enhance the solubility and were mixed with 100 ml of deionized water before placement in a shaker bath at 300 rpm for 3 h the extract was then incubated at 90 c for 30 min and left at room temperature for another hour to complete the extraction process then the bioflocculant was obtained by filtration and centrifugation at 7 000 rpm for 20 min before oven or freeze drying the product for storage at 4 c the yield gained was 74 2 thus the extraction processes of bioflocculants using water extraction methods may be different depending on the sample condition 4 1 2 ethanol extraction method ethanol extraction methods have the ability to separate water and lipo soluble components 91 retrieving bioflocculants via ethanol extraction methods can extend the lifetime of the extraction solution compared to water extraction methods wu et al 86 for instance utilized an ethanol extraction method to extract a bioflocculant from bacillus thuringiensis first the solution containing the bioflocculant was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min a volume of ethanol was then added to the supernatant collected and mixed thoroughly before centrifuging again at 5000 rpm for 15 min at room temperature for solid liquid separation purposes afterwards the flocculant precipitate was washed with a suitable volume of deionized sterile water and soaked again with ethanol two more times the extracted flocculants were then freeze dried weighed sealed and stored at a temperature below 20 c the flocculating activity obtained by wu et al 86 was 93 8 ayangbenro et al 27 also utilized an ethanol extraction in their study to retrieve bioflocculants from pantoea sp and p koreensis they centrifuged the fermentation broth at 3000 rpm for 30 min at 15 c before mixing the supernatant with cold ethanol 1 4 v v for bioflocculant precipitation and kept the mixture at 4 c for 16 h afterwards the mixture was again centrifuged 1000 rpm 30 min 15 c for precipitate collection prior to dissolving the precipitate in distilled water 1 4 v v and lyophilization the maximum yields gained for pantoea sp and p koreensis were 2 98 g l 1 fa 71 and 3 26 g l 1 fa 51 respectively in the study by karthiga and natarajan 88 ethanol acetone and methanol were used to extract bioflocculants from bacillus licheniformis and bacillus firmus by using double the volume of cold solvent ethanol acetone and methanol 1 2 v v extraction using ethanol as the extraction solvent yielded the highest amounts of bioflocculants from bacillus licheniformis and bacillus firmus compared to acetone and methanol respectively this shows that ethanol is more compatible for use in the extraction of bioflocculants from microorganisms compared to other organic solvents furthermore it was noticeable that the ethanol extraction method usually required two centrifugation processes 1 for solid liquid separation and 2 for the collection of the precipitate formed crude bioflocculant in contrast to the water extraction method this was because ethanol extraction methods are normally applied when retrieving bioflocculants from both lb eps and tb eps which require extra solvent solubility 92 in the absence of heat 4 1 3 salt solution extraction salt solutions such as sodium chloride nacl potassium chloride kcl and cetylpyridinium chloride cpc solutions have also been applied in the extraction of bioflocculants the extraction of bioflocculants using water is said to be the most accepted technique yet extractions using salt solutions are viewed as more efficient compared to water extractions 94 a study by madrona et al 95 found that there were significant effects from the salt solution concentration on the performance of the extracted bioflocculant in their study the extraction of a bioflocculant from moringa oleifera revealed that extraction using 1 m kcl was far more effective 99 7 turbidity removal compared to 0 1 m and 0 01 m kcl in real applications in producing drinking water they claimed that a high concentration of the salt solution was more effective in extracting the active compound in the bioflocculant which was a protein that led to a higher flocculating activity elkady et al 89 used cpc to extract a bioflocculant from bacillus mojavensis strain 3a with a flocculating activity of 96 1 and a yield of 5 2 g l 1 the cell free supernatant of the respective strain was concentrated to 0 2 vol using a rotary evaporator and left to dialyze overnight at 4 c in deionized water afterward three volumes of cold anhydrous ethanol at 4 c were mixed into the mixture for precipitation the precipitate formed was then dissolved again in deionized water followed by stirring with 10 cpc in the solution centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 15 min was applied to collect the precipitate prior to dissolving in 0 5 m nacl later three volumes of cold anhydrous ethanol 4 c were added for precipitation before washing with 75 ethanol three times lyophilization and storage for further use additionally aljuboori et al 58 also used cpc 50 ml of 2 cpc in their study to extract a bioflocculant from aspergillus flavus yield 0 4 g l 1 fa 87 2 with the precipitate collected by dissolving it in 100 ml of 0 5 m nacl and washing with two volumes of cold ethanol 4 1 4 acid and alkali extraction acid and alkali solutions are also frequently used for the extraction of bioflocculants in the study by zhang et al 76 on producing bioflocculants from biological sludge a combination of acid and alkali solutions was applied first 60 ml of 3 w w of hcl was used on sludge that was formerly treated with 100 ml of 4 w w naoh and the mixture was mixed with a magnetic stirrer at 400 rpm for 15 min afterward the mixture was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min and filtered with 3 μm filter paper the supernatant was then diluted with 150 ml of deionized water and the ph was adjusted to 1 before treatment with 4 w w naoh to increase the ph of the mixture followed by centrifuging at 8000 rpm for 15 min the best flocculating fa recorded was 96 in another study by guo and ma 90 they combined an alkali solution and thermal treatment alt to extract a bioflocculant from rhodococcus erythropolis fa 94 5 in the treatment the ph value of the sample was adjusted to ph 10 using 1 0 mol l 1 naoh at room temperature prior to autoclaving at 121 c for 30 min hcl was also used by sun et al 91 to extract a bioflocculant fa 99 5 from sludge due to the ability of hcl to extract flocculation active ingredients effectively they suspended the sludge in hcl 18 w w and stirred the mixture at 500 rpm for 15 min afterwards the suspension was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min to remove the sediment in addition to a high extraction efficiency it is also important to note that extraction using acid and alkali solutions at high concentrations may cause denaturalization of the bioflocculant itself 96 4 2 ultrasound assisted extraction ultrasound assisted extraction uae is often called sonication and is applied in extraction methods to create cavitation that allow bubbles to form during the sonication process the cavitation that holds the bubbles will become pressurized and implosion will occur thus creating a high temperature and pressure microenvironment and accelerating the extraction process 81 annegowda et al 97 claimed that sonication was able to reduce the processing period while consuming less energy and being environmentally friendly in addition to cost effective simple and reliable moreover sonication can also be used in the extraction of inorganic or organic substances in either the solid or liquid state 81 however it is best if the solvents used in uae are acidic or organic solvents with low viscosities and surface tensions to avoid the hindrance of cavitation 98 moreover ultrasonic baths and probe units are two devices that are usually used in the application of ultrasound in the extraction process 99 a study by li et al 100 used ultrasonic treatment for cell disruption prior to the sonication treatment the fermented broth was filtered using a 0 22 μm filter collected and resuspended in deionized water for the ultrasonication process ultrasonication was carried out at 200 250 and 300 w and 20 khz for 20 min the temperature was set below 20 c to avoid the deterioration of thermo sensitive components of the bioflocculant however it was observed that for cell disruption in plants ultrasonication often uses frequencies greater than 20 khz ramandi et al 99 used 40 khz in an ultrasonic water bath with hexane as the extracting solvent at 48 c for 30 min the temperature can be optimised in the uae where it should not exceed the boiling point of the extracting solvent the effectiveness of uae in increasing the extraction efficiency is also supported by liu et al 96 who used low frequency ultrasound 80 w 10 min in an ice bath to pre treating sludge before applying a solvent extraction technique 4 3 hydrothermal and microwave assisted extraction hydrothermal and microwave assisted extraction methods mae are considered advanced and modern extraction techniques hydrothermal extraction utilizes water bath accompanied with rigorous agitation and heating processes this technique requires high temperature above 70 c with a long extraction time minimum of 30 min with average of 2 h extraction was occurred via heat transfer from the heating medium in water bath to the extraction vessel transferred heat then perform external evaporation of solvent and internal evaporation inside compound s matrix to produce solid compounds 79 this method is currently widely applied while energy consumption from high temperature requirement and the long period of extraction become several considerations to seek for an optional method the mae uses discrete heating mechanisms that result in lower extraction times compared to conventional hydrothermal extraction methods using water and ethanol 79 additionally mae techniques also require smaller equipment sizes and are much simpler compared to conventional extraction methods 101 commercially there are two types of mae systems namely closed extraction vessels and focused microwave ovens 102 in microwave extraction methods the selection of the solvent is crucial since microwaves work best in solvents that possess high dielectric or polar properties such as water and organic solvents 79 82 zhang et al 82 reported that mae can be carried out in two ways which are solvent free extraction often applied for volatile compounds and solvent extraction often applied for non volatile compounds the existence of heat in the extraction process does increase the yield of the extraction product however in mae processes the temperature must be controlled to not surpass the optimum temperature water solvent 50 60 c alcohol based solvent 79 90 c because high microwave power and extraction temperatures can cause thermal degradation of the active constituents thus leading to a low extraction yield 79 in the implementation of mae in the extraction of a bioflocculant from okra by lee et al 101 they used sliced okra and deionized water which were exposed to a microwave heating system operated at 2450 mhz since no heating occurred when the frequency was lower or greater than 2450 mhz 102 after treatment with microwaves the mixture was left for 1 h for cooling and the complete release of the extractants into water the supernatant was collected via centrifugation 4000 rpm 30 min before drying at 105 c until a constant mass was achieved the yield obtained was 53 under 90 c heating 4 4 enzyme assisted extraction enzyme assisted extraction eae is considered an advanced extraction method with advantages such as efficiency eco friendliness sustainability selectivity and specificity according to the desired extractant 103 according to nadar et al 103 extraction via eae can eliminate the excess usage of hazardous solvents and is suitable for thermo sensitive products since the application of eae is carried out under controlled temperatures with higher production yields in the extraction of a polysaccharide bioflocculant from astragalus membranaceus using seven types of enzymes amyloglucosidade hemicellulose glucose oxidase bacterial amylase fungal amylase pectinase and cellulose the amounts of enzymes used were in the range of 0 5 5 5 at 30 70 c temperatures for 1 7 days of reaction time and ph values ranging from 3 5 13 0 104 in the study by chen et al 104 the selection of enzyme was conducted using response surface methodology with the highest extraction yield as the indicator of the optimal enzyme optimising the extraction conditions enzyme ratio temperature ph and reaction time is interesting and useful for the application of this technique in future 105 106 the extraction was further continued by ultrasonic treatment for 30 min the precipitation of the desired product was achieved by adding 95 ethanol for 36 h at 4 c and the product collected via centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 15 min before lyophilization to obtain the crude product based on the study by chen et al 104 the types of enzymes used during extraction process play a vital role in determining the yield of the desired product in addition to the amounts of enzymes applied this is because using too little enzymes causes incomplete enzyme treatment and using too much is not cost effective 103 moreover the effect of the ph and temperature in performing eae cannot be neglected since both factors play specific roles for every enzyme used most enzymes have an optimum ph value within the range of the isoelectric ph of proteins 103 and work best at temperatures ranging from 30 to 55 c 104 the application of eae beyond these temperatures will eventually result in a lower yield of the desired product due to the loss of enzyme activities 103 104 5 purification of bioflocculants the final step in the production of a bioflocculant is purification the purification step is necessary to extract the active coagulating agents and eliminate the undesired substances from the extracted bioflocculant 94 the purification of bioflocculants can be carried out thorough lyophilisation chromatography and dialysis as summarised in fig 4 agunbiade et al 50 adopted lyophilisation to obtain the purified bioflocculant however before the lyophilisation steps were carried out they dissolved the crude bioflocculant in water before a volume of chloroform and n butyl alcohol 5 2 v v mixture was added afterwards the mixture was stirred thoroughly poured into a separating funnel and left for 12 h at room temperature after the supernatant was removed two volumes of ethanol were added for bioflocculant precipitation before lyophilisation took place fujita et al 107 used chromatography in an aqueous solution to obtain a purified bioflocculant approximately 10 mm phosphate buffer was used to adjust the ph of the crude bioflocculant to ph 5 before application to a gigapite amphoteric column seikagaku kogyo co tokyo 3 2 cm 18 cm with the same buffer used flowrate of 28 ml h 1 the bioflocculant was further purified through subjection to a sephadex 200hr column pharmacia co sweden 3 2 cm 120 cm before elution by 10 mm phosphate buffer at flowrate of 8 2 ml h 1 mu et al 108 also used chromatography to purify bioflocculants with some modifications for double purification using chromatography first they resuspended the bioflocculant in 3 ml deionized water and loaded it onto an anion exchange chromatography column of deae 52 cellulose 1 5 50 cm sodium chloride nacl was used to remove the absorbed substance at flow rate of 1 ml min 1 and the eluent was collected and loaded onto a sephadex g 100 for gel permeation chromatography 1 5 50 cm with deionized water used to elute the mixture before the lyophilisation step to yield a pure fraction of bioflocculant on the other hand karthiga and natarajan 88 utilized vacuum drying and dialysis to purify a bioflocculant the bioflocculant was hydrated for 2 h in order to eliminate all water and solvent using a rotary evaporator prior to dialysis against distilled water the mixture was then kept overnight at 4 c until further use vacuum drying was also utilized in the study by sun et al 91 however they used 40 ml of cold ethanol and adjusted the mixture to ph 8 using 1 w w naoh with continuous stirring with the mixture kept at 4 c for precipitation to occur the precipitate was then collected centrifuged at rpm for 15 minutes15 min washed with distilled water evaporated for 2 h in a rotary evaporator and vacuum dried for 12 h 6 scaling up challenges of bioflocculant production although most studies have reported the effectiveness of bioflocculants in water and wastewater treatment most of this research was carried out at the laboratory scale and is not widely applicable in real wastewater treatment plants wwtps the development and application of bioflocculants at the industrial scale is observed to be restricted due to the sensitivity of the products to the preparation process moderate flocculating efficiencies 62 easy degradability over time and higher production cost bukahri et al 2020 especially downstream costs extraction and purification compared to commercial flocculants 9 salehizadeh et al 13 reported that the production of bioflocculants through microbial bioprocesses is high cost in terms of carbon sources 85 and the huge amount of solvents required during the extraction and purification processes make them consequently hard to scale up commercially the production of bioflocculants from mixtures of microorganisms on the other hand is quite difficult to understand since the bioflocculants produced are also complex in form and their functional molecules have not yet been thoroughly studied 108 additionally the production of bioflocculant from natural resources might also yield a proportion of ineffective ingredients for flocculation thus affecting the overall production cost due to the requirement of eliminating the ineffective ingredients 108 moreover conflict in deciding the most suitable bioflocculant with which to treat wastewater may arise since the characteristics of the produced bioflocculants often vary according to the bacterial species and carbon and nutrient sources in addition to challenges from the production of bioflocculant itself the application of bioflocculants in wastewater treatment may be inappropriate due to the extreme ph values and concentrations of wastewater 94 optimal operating parameters such as the dosage of the bioflocculant are also required to ensure that maximum flocculation is achieved thus failure to maintain the optimum dosage of the bioflocculant will result in minimal removal efficiency in wastewater treatment 50 7 conclusion bioflocculants utilisation poses promising efficiency for water and wastewater treatment bioflocculants produced from microorganisms or plants must go through a downstream process to be used in real applications the extraction steps are considered the most crucial steps since these steps will determine the quality and the yield of the bioflocculant production solvent extraction ultrasound assisted extraction uae hydrothermal microwave assisted extraction mae and enzyme assisted extraction eae are several methods to be used in bioflocculant extraction while solvent extraction considered to be the most convenient technique as compared other techniques lyophilisation chromatography and dialysis have been successfully applied in bioflocculant purification the difficulties and challenges especially in terms of extraction cost are still main issues in bioflocculant production therefore cheap yet effective extraction techniques need to be thoroughly investigated determination of appropriate method and optimisation of bioflocculant production conditions are suggested to be conducted in future to enrich and strengthen this research topic real scale application of bioflocculant in water and wastewater treatment plant is currently considered as inappropriate due to the cost while deep analysis including the sludge handling cost is yet to be conducted utilisation of bioflocculant will produce biodegradable sludge which reduce the sludge handling cost and having potential for further utilisation as compared to the handling of non biodegradable or hazardous sludge declaration of

subglutinans isotherms 1 introduction environmental issues have exacerbated with ceaseless anthropogenic activities and population growth increasing demand for water resources has been observed with the industrial revolution perhaps being a universal solvent water is contaminated with foreign substances released from the industries as wastewater heavy metals dyes surfactants and pharmaceuticals are some of the notable toxic substances widely present in industrial discharges 1 5 of these heavy metals have become a remarkable pollutant owing to its non biodegradable and mutagenic nature heavy metals are released from industries having improper industrial wastewater treatment plant copper chromium cadmium zinc lead mercury cobalt nickel and molybdenum are some of the toxic heavy metals amply present in industrial discharges 6 8 heavy metals are transported extensively through surface waters which have a deteriorating effect on every geographical point they travel through 9 10 the deposition of heavy metals in agricultural soil affects plant growth metabolism attainment of detrimental levels of heavy metals has a significant effect on the food chain by accumulation in it which causes different health effects in humans 11 14 chromium is one such heavy metal widely existent in natural resources such as mineral soils freshwater and rocks chrome plating metallurgy wood preservation and leather tanning are some of the industrial processes where chromium is abundantly and frequently utilized 15 17 two oxidation states of chromium such as hexavalent chromium cr vi ions and trivalent chromium cr iii ions are prevalent in the environment cr iii ion is essential for human metabolic processes such as glucose and cholesterol maintenance nucleic acid or protein synthesis and membrane stability 18 however high concentrations lead to complexing reactions with organic compounds interfering the metabolic growth process of human beings hexavalent chromium cr vi ion is mutagenic and carcinogenic because of their oxidizing character 19 21 two predominant forms of cr vi ions are dichromate cr2o7 2 and chromate cro4 2 under acidic environment dichromate ion is common and chromate is found over the ph of 6 0 oxidation of cr iii ions to cr vi ions has toxic effect on living organisms 22 cr vi ions can easily form complex with other compounds forming metallic complexes which crosses the cellular membrane barrier and alters the cell structure by triggering the accumulation of reactive oxygen species ros within the cell deposition of chromium in lungs can cause squamous lung carcinoma and cancerous lesions have been observed in workers with recurrent exposure to chromium metal in soil chromium accumulation affects the plant propagation process by affecting seed germination biomass and crop yield in case of aquatic flora and fauna metal alters and affects the genetic material leading to death of those organisms 23 27 hence proper processing of chromium contaminated industrial effluents is essential to alleviate these environmental and health issues the maximal permissible limit for chromium in drinking water according to world health organisation who is 0 05 mg l some of the physic chemical techniques employed for the removal of hazardous chemicals include filtration ion exchange process reverse osmosis chemical precipitation membrane separation floatation coagulation and solvent extraction 28 34 however high operational cost initial investment and usage hurdles in low concentration of heavy metals has prompted the researchers to focus on alternative means of heavy metal removal on the basis of aspects such as economic feasibility high efficiency low initial and operational cost the process of adsorption has gained a noteworthy interest in heavy metal removal techniques adsorbents play a pivotal role in the remediation of heavy metals 35 37 there are different types of agro waste materials existing in the environment among all waste materials caryota urens inflorescence waste biomass kappaphycus alvarezii waste biomass treated waste newspaper sunflower stem waste wheat bran biomass spirulina patensis biomass residues phosphate mine waste and cashew nut shell were utilized as adsorbent for chromium removal from the environment 38 42 owing to stability biodegradability and less toxicity biological adsorbents have gained significant attentiveness biosorbents bind to pollutants in aquatic system passively by means of physical or chemical mechanism which subsequently results in pollutant removal from the corresponding ecosystem 43 bacteria fungi and algae are some of the biosorbents utilized by the researchers for their exploration 44 45 dead biomass has notable advantages over live biomass

contaminated soil was identified by 18s rrna sequencing blasting of isolated fungal sequence with ncbi blast sequence similarity search tool was performed and the fungal strain was identified to be fusarium subglutinans the 18s rrna nucleotide sequence of an identified fusarium subglutinans was shown in fig 1 a that was published with unique ncbi ganbank accession number mk512676 phyml have been utilized to analyse the evolutionary correlation of isolated fungal strain the phylogenetic tree is depicted in fig 1 b 3 1 2 functional group analysis occurrence of different functional groups on the biosorbent surface was recognized by conducting fourier transform infra red spectrophotometer ftir analysis fig 2 a and 2 b displays the ftir analysis of fusarium subglutinans rdfp and fusarium subglutinans padfp absorbance bands at 3360 and 3333 cm 1 on the two mixed biomasses indicates the presence of oh group primary and secondary aliphatic amines sharp peaks at 565 cm 1 537 cm 1 524 594 and 547 cm 1 denote the presence of alkyl halide groups present on fusarium subglutinans rdfp and fusarium subglutinans padfp broad peak at 2927 and 2850 cm 1 shows the occurrence of c h asymmetric or symmetric stretching in methylene in the rdfp mixed biomass other sharp peaks 1614 1427 1320 1099 1010 637 cm 1 on the rdfp mixed biomass correspond to the presence of primary amine nh bend carboxylic group vinyl c h group aromatic nitro compounds aliphatic amines aliphatic fluoro compounds and alkenes cc stretch respectively these functional groups present on fusarium subglutinans rdfp infers the essential groups for the adsorption of cr vi ions the pyrolysis assisted physical modification process denotes the presence of additional functional groups such as methyne groupe stretching in silicone group si o si aliphatic phosphates aromatic amines specified by the absorption peaks at 1046 and 1318 cm 1 respectively intense peaks at 1633 and 605 cm 1 shows the existence of alkenes cc stretch in pafdp mixed biomass the occurrences of alcohol and nitro groups are exponible for the matrix layer and covalent bond formation with the adsorbate molecules thus both rdfp and padfp with fusarium subglutinans biomass has the requisite functional group characteristics for the efficient adsorption of cr vi ions from aqueous solutions 3 1 3 surface analysis microporous structural analysis of fusarium subglutinans rdfp and fusarium subglutinans padfp is performed by scanning electron microscope sem analysis and is represented in fig 3 a and b before the modification process rdfp mixed biomass demonstrated the presence of cracks and pits with low number of pores on its surface contrarily physically modified padfp fungal biomass showed irregular surfaces with large number of pores on their surfaces pyrolysis process has expanded the number of pore and facilitated the cavity generation on the fruit peel biosorbent surface in the amid of two mixed biomasses due to the presence of higher number of porous and cavities on their surfaces fusarium subglutinans padfp was found to possess superior surface characteristics for cr vi ions removal than the fusarium subglutinans rdfp 3 1 4 elemental analysis edx energy dispersive x ray analysis was conducted to quantify the elements existing in the mixed biomass materials fig 4 a and b shows the edx results of fusarium subglutinans rdfp and fusarium subglutinans padfp mixed biomass rdfp mixed fungal biomass elemental analysis discloses the weight percentage of carbon oxygen magnesium silica potassium and calcium to be 6 97 77 02 1 00 2 37 1 03 and 11 61 respectively the presence of other elements might have reduced the adsorption ability of the rdfp mixed biomass while the pyrolysis process slightly increased the carbon content to 8 41 wt other elements include 80 64 oxygen 0 82 magnesium and 10 13 calcium from the spectrum it is evident that the adequate amount of carbon and oxygen present in the mixed biomasses are responsible for the adsorption of cr vi ions 3 1 5 the phpzc of mixed biomasses the ph of the point of zero charge phpzc of the mixed biomasses depends on the chemical properties of the functional groups on their surfaces the phpzc analysis results were depicted in the fig 5 from the fig 5 it was observed that the phpzc of the mixed biomasses was found to be 4 0 this result indicated that the mixed biomass surfaces acquired positive charge below 4 0 phpzc and above the phpzc the mixed biomass surfaces acquired negative charge 3 2 influence of ph for the removal of cr vi ions onto mixed biomasses ph plays a significant role in adsorption process experiments were carried out by differing the ph of the solution from 2 0 9 0 influence of ph on cr vi ions adsorption onto mixed biomasses were depicted in fig 6 a from the figure it can be observed that the removal increases as the ph of the adsorbate solution increases from 2 0 4 0 after which a decline in removal was noted from ph 5 0 9 0 high mobility of hydrogen ions at low ph might have resulted in increased competition for actives sites between h ions and cr vi ions which made the removal process slower therefore lower percentage removal was observed at the ph 2 0 at higher ph metal hydroxide precipitate was formed with hydroxyl ions reduces availability of free cr vi ions quantity for adsorption 67 in other words as the ph increased above 4 0 the electrostatic attraction between the metal ions and the actives sites on the adsorbent surface was lower 68 therefore lower percentage cr vi ions removal was observed in the ph ranges from 5 0 9 0 optimum ph value for the adsorption of cr vi ions onto mixed biomasses were found to be 4 0 3 3 influence of adsorbent dose the cr vi ions removal onto mixed biomasses was analysed quantitatively by changing various dose of mixed biomasses 1 0 9 0 g for fusarium subglutinans rdfp biomass and 0 5 5 0 g for fusarium subglutinans padfp the results were shown in fig 6 b and 6 c for fusarium subglutinans rdfp and fusarium subglutinans padfp respectively the removal of cr vi ions increased from 1 0 6 0 g in rdfp mixed fungal biomass and from 0 5 to 3 5 g in padfp mixed fungal biomass reduced removal might be due to low equilibrium and driving force between cr vi ions and the mixed biomasses however beyond that adsorbent dose values the removal was consistent indicating the saturation of active sites on the mixed biomasses by cr vi ions optimal values of adsorbent dose for cr vi ions removal was observed to be 6 g l for fusarium subglutinans rdfp biomass and 3 5 g l for fusarium subglutinans padfp biomass 3 4 influence of temperature effect of temperature on the present adsorption system was studied by performing batch experiments at different temperatures such as 303 k 313 k 323 k and 333 k with various initial concentration 25 150 mg l and constant adsorbent dosage temperature influence on cr vi ions removal onto mixed biomasses were shown in fig 7 a for fusarium subglutinans rdfp and fig 7 b for fusarium subglutinans padfp decreased removal was observed with increased temperature the decline in removal could be due to poor or weak adsorptive interactions between cr vi ions and mixed biomasses at the temperature 303 k hydrogen chromate ions hcr2o4 were electrostatically interact with the protonated surfaces of the mixed biomasses therefore maximal cr vi ions removal onto fungal mixed rdfp and padfp biomasses was noted to be 303 k it also denotes the exothermic nature of cr vi ions adsorption process 3 5 thermodynamic results temperature dependent studies were performed to cast an overview on the nature of adsorption process such as feasibility exothermic or endothermic nature the graph of log kc vs t was plotted to analyse the thermodynamic behaviour and is depicted in fig 7 c and d for fusarium subglutinans rdfp and fusarium subglutinans padfp thermodynamic parameters δsº δhº and δgº for cr vi ions adsorption onto mixed biomasses were tabulated in table 1 energy release due to adherence of cr vi ions onto mixed biomasses surface is inferred from the negative δhº values it stipulates the exothermic nature of chromium ions adsorption the maximum percentage removal of cr vi ions onto mixed biomasses was observed at 303 k due to exothermic in nature keep on increasing the temperature up to 333 k results weakening of ionic bonds between the cr vi ions and the positively charged functional groups on the mixed biomass surface which results lower percentage removal of cr vi ions from the negative values of δsº it is apparent that there is a decreased movement between chromium ions with rdfp and padfp spontaneous nature of the chromium ions onto mixed biomasses was evident from the negative δgº values from the thermodynamic results it is inferred that adsorption of cr vi ions onto mixed biomasses is spontaneous feasible and exothermic in nature 3 6 influence of initial cr vi ions concentration initial chromium ion concentration has a remarkable role in suppressing the mass transfer resistance by providing required driving forces experiments were conducted with different cr vi ions concentration 25 150 mg l with ph value of 4 and an adsorbent dosage of 6 g l for fusarium subglutinans rdfp biomass and 3 5 g l for fusarium subglutinans padfp biomass the effect of initial adsorbate concentration on adsorption system is portrayed in fig 8 a the figure shows the decline in chromium removal with improving initial concentration of chromium ions increased cr vi ions competition for limited number of active locates on the mixed biomass surface have resulted in reduced removal of it hence initial chromium ion solution of low concentration 25 mg l is more preferable for the maximal removal of chromium ions 3 7 modeling of batch adsorption isotherm data type of interaction such as monolayer or heterogeneous nature of interaction between chromium ions and mixed biomass molecules is determined by adsorption isotherm studies langmuir freundlich temkin sips and toth isotherm models were used to analyse the equilibrium data for chromium ions adsorption onto mixed biomasses fig 8 b and c represents the plot of qe vs ce for both mixed biomasses isotherm parameters for cr vi ions adsorption onto fusarium subglutinans rdfp and fusarium subglutinans padfp were listed in table 2a the best fitting model among five models would be chosen based on high r2 values and low sse and rmse values from the langmuir isotherm maximum adsorption capacity of mixed biomasses was found to be 11 mg g and 16 52 mg g for fusarium subglutinans rdfp and fusarium subglutinans padfp respectively freundlich isotherm model was used to determine whether the adsorption process is heterogeneous in nature the low r2 values confirmed the absence of multilayer adsorptive nature of the mixed biomasses indirect interactions between adsorbent and adsorbate molecules can be predicted from temkin isotherm from the temkin plot shown in fig 8 b and c temkin parameter values were calculated as follows at 103 9 l g b 0 8374 j mol for fusarium subglutinans rdfp and at 114 4 l g b 0 5729 j mol for fusarium subglutinans padfp this value is the indication of the heat of sorption which confirmed that the adsorption of cr vi ions onto mixed biomasses was follows physisorption mechanism because of the low r2 value 0 8008 and 0 8902 temkin model is the not well fitted isotherm model for the present adsorption system toth and sips isotherm is a three parameter model used for the prediction of heterogeneous nature of adsorption process the calculated sips model parameters are listed in the table 2a for cr vi ion adsorption onto mixed biomasses as follows ks 16 43 l g αs 0 9249 l g βs 0 6724 and r2 0 8699 for fusarium subglutinans rdfp and ks 11 62 l g αs 0 8906 l g βs 0 5147 and r2 0 9195 for fusarium subglutinans padfp these values indicated that the adsorption of cr vi ions was homogeneous in nature the lower r2 value of sips and toth 0 85 and 0 8926 for fusarium subglutinans rdfp and fusarium subglutinans padfp respectively isotherm model denoted that these models are not well fitted isotherm models for cr vi ion adsorption onto mixed biomasses based on high correlation coefficient values and low error values langmuir model was observed to be a best suiting model for the present adsorption system with r2 value of 0 9414 and 0 9304 error values of sse 3 47 and 2 781 rmse 0 835 and 0 395 for rdfp and padfp mixed fungal biomass therefore the langmuir model explains the adsorption of cr vi ions onto the mixed biomasses was homogeneous in nature the adsorption effectiveness of padfp mixed biomass was found superior to rdfp mixed fungal sorbent and isotherms for both the mixed biosorbents is of the following order langmuir sips toth temkin freundlich isotherm the obtained maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of the mixed biomasses was compared with different adsorbents previously used for cr vi ions adsorption and enumerated in table 2b from the table 2b higher qm value was evident that mixed biomasses has distinguished adsorption capability for cr vi ions adsorption 3 8 influence of contact time adsorption potential of mixed biosorbents is greatly influenced by contact time of the adsorption process batch experiments were performed with varied contact time 10 90 min in different concentrations of cr vi ions concentrations 25 150 mg l fig 9 a and b displays the time profile of cr vi ions adsorption onto rdfp and padfp mixed fungal biomass at the initial time abundant number of active sites for cr vi ions binding have resulted in increased adsorption from contact time of 10 min 60 min and also increased removal was observed with low concentration due to the adequate active sites on the biosorbent surface however after a determined contact time period persistent removal was noted due to saturation of active locates on the mixed biomass surface the ideal time for the cr vi ions adsorption onto rdfp and padfp mixed biomass was noted to be 60 min 3 9 modeling of batch adsorption kinetic data in order to study the mechanism of adsorption process adsorption kinetic studies were conducted three different adsorption kinetic models pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich kinetic models were used to fit the obtained experimental data these data were plotted by the graph qt vs t and is depicted in fig 9 c and d for fusarium subglutinans rdfp and fusarium subglutinans padfp respectively the kinetic parameters for cr vi ions adsorption onto rdfp and padfp mixed fungal biomass was listed in table 3 the percentage removal of chromium ions drops with escalating concentration with respect to different contact time due to high competition of chromium ions on the mixed biomasses surface the best fitted kinetic model was chosen based on the correlation coefficient r2 value as well as the difference between the calculated qe values and the experimental qe value elovich kinetic model can be used to infer the chemisorption of ions onto heterogeneous surface however due to low correlation coefficient values it is not considered to be best model for the present adsorption system from the table 3 it can be inferred that pseudo first order kinetic model to be a best fitting model for adsorption of cr vi ions based on high r2 values and then its calculated qe value was very close to the experimental qe value than the other two kinetic models it also infers the chemical nature of cr vi ions adsorption onto rdfp and padfp mixed fungal biomass from the kinetic results it was confirmed that the pseudo first order kinetic model to be a best fitting model and the adsorption of cr vi ions onto the mixed biomasses follows physical adsorption process 4 conclusion in the present research cr vi ions adsorption capability of the synthesized mixed biomasses using fusarium subglutinans and dragon fruit wastes raw and pyrolysis assisted dragon fruit peel was studied characterization studies confirms that the prepared biosorbent material has better surface properties towards cr vi ions adsorption different adsorption influencing parameters were optimized as follows by the batch adsorption studies ph 4 0 mixed biomass dose 6 0 g l of fusarium subglutinans rdfp and 3 5 g l of fusarium subglutinans padfp 303 k temperature and 60 min contact time from modeling studies it was found that langmuir isotherm model and pseudo first order kinetic model was established to be an appropriate model for cr vi ions adsorption using mixed biomasses the maximum monolayer cr vi ions adsorption capacity qm of the synthesized mixed biomasses was estimated to be 11 mg g and 16 52 mg g for fusarium subglutinans rdfp biomass and fusarium subglutinans padfp biomass respectively thermodynamic study reveals that the adsorption of cr vi ions by the mixed biomasses was feasible spontaneous and exothermic in nature from these observations present study concluded that the mixed biomasses has substantial potentiality for cr vi ions adsorption due to superior surface properties including large surface area higher number of pores and availability of essential function groups mixed biomass of fusarium subglutinans padfp shows better cr vi ions adsorption results at lower adsorbent dose 3 5 g l than fusarium subglutinans rdfp because of the waste based adsorbent materials used in this study process was practically more feasible and applicable for heavy metal removal from the wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest 
13617,heavy metals are the prominent toxic pollutant extensively present in the industrial waste due to its toxicity in nature it should be removed from the industrial waste in this research raw and pyrolysis assisted dragon fruit peel along with fungal biomass fusarium subglutinans was utilized as a mixed adsorbent for the removal of cr vi ions from the aqueous phase ftir sem and edx analyses were used to characterize the synthesized mixed biomasses fusarium subglutinans rdfp and fusarium subglutinans padfp batch adsorption tests reveal that optimum conditions for the effective removal of

60 min the adsorption equilibrium data and contact time data were best fitted with langmiur and pseudo first order model respectively the monolayer adsorption capacities were found to be 11 0 mg g for fusarium subglutinans rdfp and 16 52 mg g for fusarium subglutinans padfp thermodynamic parameters demonstrated that the adsorption was favorable at low temperatures and exothermic process overall

subglutinans isotherms 1 introduction environmental issues have exacerbated with ceaseless anthropogenic activities and population growth increasing demand for water resources has been observed with the industrial revolution perhaps being a universal solvent water is contaminated with foreign substances released from the industries as wastewater heavy metals dyes surfactants and pharmaceuticals are some of the notable toxic substances widely present in industrial discharges 1 5 of these heavy metals have become a remarkable pollutant owing to its non biodegradable and mutagenic nature heavy metals are released from industries having improper industrial wastewater treatment plant copper chromium cadmium zinc lead mercury cobalt nickel and molybdenum are some of the toxic heavy metals amply present in industrial discharges 6 8 heavy metals are transported extensively through surface waters which have a deteriorating effect on every geographical point they travel through 9 10 the deposition of heavy metals in agricultural soil affects plant growth metabolism attainment of detrimental levels of heavy metals has a significant effect on the food chain by accumulation in it which causes different health effects in humans 11 14 chromium is one such heavy metal widely existent in natural resources such as mineral soils freshwater and rocks chrome plating metallurgy wood preservation and leather tanning are some of the industrial processes where chromium is abundantly and frequently utilized 15 17 two oxidation states of chromium such as hexavalent chromium cr vi ions and trivalent chromium cr iii ions are prevalent in the environment cr iii ion is essential for human metabolic processes such as glucose and cholesterol maintenance nucleic acid or protein synthesis and membrane stability 18 however high concentrations lead to complexing reactions with organic compounds interfering the metabolic growth process of human beings hexavalent chromium cr vi ion is mutagenic and carcinogenic because of their oxidizing character 19 21 two predominant forms of cr vi ions are dichromate cr2o7 2 and chromate cro4 2 under acidic environment dichromate ion is common and chromate is found over the ph of 6 0 oxidation of cr iii ions to cr vi ions has toxic effect on living organisms 22 cr vi ions can easily form complex with other compounds forming metallic complexes which crosses the cellular membrane barrier and alters the cell structure by triggering the accumulation of reactive oxygen species ros within the cell deposition of chromium in lungs can cause squamous lung carcinoma and cancerous lesions have been observed in workers with recurrent exposure to chromium metal in soil chromium accumulation affects the plant propagation process by affecting seed germination biomass and crop yield in case of aquatic flora and fauna metal alters and affects the genetic material leading to death of those organisms 23 27 hence proper processing of chromium contaminated industrial effluents is essential to alleviate these environmental and health issues the maximal permissible limit for chromium in drinking water according to world health organisation who is 0 05 mg l some of the physic chemical techniques employed for the removal of hazardous chemicals include filtration ion exchange process reverse osmosis chemical precipitation membrane separation floatation coagulation and solvent extraction 28 34 however high operational cost initial investment and usage hurdles in low concentration of heavy metals has prompted the researchers to focus on alternative means of heavy metal removal on the basis of aspects such as economic feasibility high efficiency low initial and operational cost the process of adsorption has gained a noteworthy interest in heavy metal removal techniques adsorbents play a pivotal role in the remediation of heavy metals 35 37 there are different types of agro waste materials existing in the environment among all waste materials caryota urens inflorescence waste biomass kappaphycus alvarezii waste biomass treated waste newspaper sunflower stem waste wheat bran biomass spirulina patensis biomass residues phosphate mine waste and cashew nut shell were utilized as adsorbent for chromium removal from the environment 38 42 owing to stability biodegradability and less toxicity biological adsorbents have gained significant attentiveness biosorbents bind to pollutants in aquatic system passively by means of physical or chemical mechanism which subsequently results in pollutant removal from the corresponding ecosystem 43 bacteria fungi and algae are some of the biosorbents utilized by the researchers for their exploration 44 45 dead biomass has notable advantages over live biomass such as reusage increased efficiency easy operation absence of growth medium requirement and absence of secondary toxic metabolites production 46 47 fungal cell wall composition chitin chitosan glucans and glycoproteins assist in the removal of metal ions from aqueous solutions 48 adsorption cellular precipitation ion exchange biosorption and accumulation are the mechanisms by which fungal biomass eliminate aqueous pollutants 49 similarly fruit wastes such as pomelo peel microporous activated carbon from aegle marmelos fruit shell strychnos nux vomica fruit shell mango kernel bael fruit shell aspergillus sp trichoderma sp and scenedesmus sp are also being utilized for treatment of hazardous pollutants 50 57 in recent years mixed biosorbent has been used for remediation of pollutants to enhance the efficiency of adsorption process dragon fruit commonly known as pitaya is widely used as nutritional supplement due to its excellent nutrients and anti oxidant composition but the fruit peel is discarded as waste though it contains some valuable components hence dragon fruit peel waste is applied as one of the economically feasible adsorbent in the present study in order to elude blocking of pores on the adsorbent surface and for biomass conversion physical modification process like pyrolysis can be carried out 58 present research focuses on utilizing dragon fruit peel waste

in a muffle furnace and subjected to pyrolysis process at a temperature of 400 c which subsequently undergoes carbonization process in nitrogen atmosphere for 4 h pyrolysis can be divided into three types based on the temperature employed for this process such as slow pyrolysis 300 c 700 c fast pyrolysis 550 c 1250 c and flash pyrolysis 800 c 1300 c among these pyrolysis methods biochar carbon rich solid product was obtained at higher weight percentage wt than other pyrolysis products such as biooil and gases at slow pyrolysis process therefore for the higher wt of dragon fruit peel biochar production the pyrolysis process was carried out 400 c slow pyrolysis pyrolysis process at 400 c slow pyrolysis decomposes the organic matter present in the dragon fruit peel and produce solid carbon rich product called biochar samples were withdrawn after a certain time span and placed at room temperature for cooling crushing of carbon produced from pyrolysis process was carried out and sieved to obtain uniform particle size of 0 54 mm the resultant physically modified adsorbent was named as padfp pyrolysis assisted dragon fruit peel 2 2 2 fungal biosorbent synthesis isolation of fungal

and the procedure was repeated up until single uniform fungal species on the pda plates were obtained 18s rrna sequencing was performed to identify the fungal species fungal species were mass cultivated in pda broth pda broth was prepared sterilized and inoculated with isolated fungal strain then the flasks were incubated for 28 days at 37 c for mycelium growth mycelium was separated from broth after a time interim and subjected to drying for 24 h at 90 c to obtain fungal biosorbent 2 2 3 preparation of mixed biomass two biosorbents dragon fruit peel rdfp and padfp and fusarium subglutinans were employed for expulsion of cr vi ions from synthetic solution equal proportion of prepared fruit waste rdfp and padfp and fungal biomass was mixed together the obtained two mixed biomasses were labelled as fusarium subglutinans rdfp and fusarium subglutinans padfp required amount of mixed biomasses were added to the adsorption system based on preparative examination 2 3

abi 3730xl sequencer by utilizing 18 s rrna universal primers at yaazh xenomics coimbatore india using phyml 3 0 program phylogenetic tree of the sequenced species was acquired sem ftir and edx characterization studies were conducted to explore the surface morphology functional groups and elements present on the biosorbent surface 2 4 determination ph of the point of zero charge phpzc of the mixed biomasses the ph of the point of zero charge phpzc of the mixed biomasses was determined by ph drift method the experiments were carried out in the two set of eight different 100 ml flasks containing 20 ml of 0 01 mol l nacl the solution ph was adjusted into 2 0 9 0 using 0 5 m hcl and 0 5 m naoh to the first set of flasks 0 5 g of fusarium subglutinans rdfp and to the second set of eight flasks 0 5 g of fusarium subglutinans padfp were added and the final ph of the solution was measured after 10 h of agitation from that the phpzc of mixed biomasses were calculated by using the following equation 1 δph phi phf where phi is the initial solution ph and phf is the final solution ph after cr vi ions adsorption 2 5 batch adsorption analysis estimation of optimal values of each parameter through batch adsorption study is essential for the efficacious removal of cr vi ions from aqueous solution the studies were carried out using erlenmeyer flask of 100 ml capacity comprising a requisite amount of mixed biomass and a known concentration of chromium batch adsorption experiment was carried out by varying the different adsorption influencing parameters such as ph initial cr vi ions concentration temperature contact time and mixed biosorbents dose flasks were subjected to shaking and incubation in a temperature controlled shaking incubator centrifugation of the adsorption

contaminated soil was identified by 18s rrna sequencing blasting of isolated fungal sequence with ncbi blast sequence similarity search tool was performed and the fungal strain was identified to be fusarium subglutinans the 18s rrna nucleotide sequence of an identified fusarium subglutinans was shown in fig 1 a that was published with unique ncbi ganbank accession number mk512676 phyml have been utilized to analyse the evolutionary correlation of isolated fungal strain the phylogenetic tree is depicted in fig 1 b 3 1 2 functional group analysis occurrence of different functional groups on the biosorbent surface was recognized by conducting fourier transform infra red spectrophotometer ftir analysis fig 2 a and 2 b displays the ftir analysis of fusarium subglutinans rdfp and fusarium subglutinans padfp absorbance bands at 3360 and 3333 cm 1 on the two mixed biomasses indicates the presence of oh group primary and secondary aliphatic amines sharp peaks at 565 cm 1 537 cm 1 524 594 and 547 cm 1 denote the presence of alkyl halide groups present on fusarium subglutinans rdfp and fusarium subglutinans padfp broad peak at 2927 and 2850 cm 1 shows the occurrence of c h asymmetric or symmetric stretching in methylene in the rdfp mixed biomass other sharp peaks 1614 1427 1320 1099 1010 637 cm 1 on the rdfp mixed biomass correspond to the presence of primary amine nh bend carboxylic group vinyl c h group aromatic nitro compounds aliphatic amines aliphatic fluoro compounds and alkenes cc stretch respectively these functional groups present on fusarium subglutinans rdfp infers the essential groups for the adsorption of cr vi ions the pyrolysis assisted physical modification process denotes the presence of additional functional groups such as methyne groupe stretching in silicone group si o si aliphatic phosphates aromatic amines specified by the absorption peaks at 1046 and 1318 cm 1 respectively intense peaks at 1633 and 605 cm 1 shows the existence of alkenes cc stretch in pafdp mixed biomass the occurrences of alcohol and nitro groups are exponible for the matrix layer and covalent bond formation with the adsorbate molecules thus both rdfp and padfp with fusarium subglutinans biomass has the requisite functional group characteristics for the efficient adsorption of cr vi ions from aqueous solutions 3 1 3 surface analysis microporous structural analysis of fusarium subglutinans rdfp and fusarium subglutinans padfp is performed by scanning electron microscope sem analysis and is represented in fig 3 a and b before the modification process rdfp mixed biomass demonstrated the presence of cracks and pits with low number of pores on its surface contrarily physically modified padfp fungal biomass showed irregular surfaces with large number of pores on their surfaces pyrolysis process has expanded the number of pore and facilitated the cavity generation on the fruit peel biosorbent surface in the amid of two mixed biomasses due to the presence of higher number of porous and cavities on their surfaces fusarium subglutinans padfp was found to possess superior surface characteristics for cr vi ions removal than the fusarium subglutinans rdfp 3 1 4 elemental analysis edx energy dispersive x ray analysis was conducted to quantify the elements existing in the mixed biomass materials fig 4 a and b shows the edx results of fusarium subglutinans rdfp and fusarium subglutinans padfp mixed biomass rdfp mixed fungal biomass elemental analysis discloses the weight percentage of carbon oxygen magnesium silica potassium and calcium to be 6 97 77 02 1 00 2 37 1 03 and 11 61 respectively the presence of other elements might have reduced the adsorption ability of the rdfp mixed biomass while the pyrolysis process slightly increased the carbon content to 8 41 wt other elements include 80 64 oxygen 0 82 magnesium and 10 13 calcium from the spectrum it is evident that the adequate amount of carbon and oxygen present in the mixed biomasses are responsible for the adsorption of cr vi ions 3 1 5 the phpzc of mixed biomasses the ph of the point of zero charge phpzc of the mixed biomasses depends on the chemical properties of the functional groups on their surfaces the phpzc analysis results were depicted in the fig 5 from the fig 5 it was observed that the phpzc of the mixed biomasses was found to be 4 0 this result indicated that the mixed biomass surfaces acquired positive charge below 4 0 phpzc and above the phpzc the mixed biomass surfaces acquired negative charge 3 2 influence of ph for the removal of cr vi ions onto mixed biomasses ph plays a significant role in adsorption process experiments were carried out by differing the ph of the solution from 2 0 9 0 influence of ph on cr vi ions adsorption onto mixed biomasses were depicted in fig 6 a from the figure it can be observed that the removal increases as the ph of the adsorbate solution increases from 2 0 4 0 after which a decline in removal was noted from ph 5 0 9 0 high mobility of hydrogen ions at low ph might have resulted in increased competition for actives sites between h ions and cr vi ions which made the removal process slower therefore lower percentage removal was observed at the ph 2 0 at higher ph metal hydroxide precipitate was formed with hydroxyl ions reduces availability of free cr vi ions quantity for adsorption 67 in other words as the ph increased above 4 0 the electrostatic attraction between the metal ions and the actives sites on the adsorbent surface was lower 68 therefore lower percentage cr vi ions removal was observed in the ph ranges from 5 0 9 0 optimum ph value for the adsorption of cr vi ions onto mixed biomasses were found to be 4 0 3 3 influence of adsorbent dose the cr vi ions removal onto mixed biomasses was analysed quantitatively by changing various dose of mixed biomasses 1 0 9 0 g for fusarium subglutinans rdfp biomass and 0 5 5 0 g for fusarium subglutinans padfp the results were shown in fig 6 b and 6 c for fusarium subglutinans rdfp and fusarium subglutinans padfp respectively the removal of cr vi ions increased from 1 0 6 0 g in rdfp mixed fungal biomass and from 0 5 to 3 5 g in padfp mixed fungal biomass reduced removal might be due to low equilibrium and driving force between cr vi ions and the mixed biomasses however beyond that adsorbent dose values the removal was consistent indicating the saturation of active sites on the mixed biomasses by cr vi ions optimal values of adsorbent dose for cr vi ions removal was observed to be 6 g l for fusarium subglutinans rdfp biomass and 3 5 g l for fusarium subglutinans padfp biomass 3 4 influence of temperature effect of temperature on the present adsorption system was studied by performing batch experiments at different temperatures such as 303 k 313 k 323 k and 333 k with various initial concentration 25 150 mg l and constant adsorbent dosage temperature influence on cr vi ions removal onto mixed biomasses were shown in fig 7 a for fusarium subglutinans rdfp and fig 7 b for fusarium subglutinans padfp decreased removal was observed with increased temperature the decline in removal could be due to poor or weak adsorptive interactions between cr vi ions and mixed biomasses at the temperature 303 k hydrogen chromate ions hcr2o4 were electrostatically interact with the protonated surfaces of the mixed biomasses therefore maximal cr vi ions removal onto fungal mixed rdfp and padfp biomasses was noted to be 303 k it also denotes the exothermic nature of cr vi ions adsorption process 3 5 thermodynamic results temperature dependent studies were performed to cast an overview on the nature of adsorption process such as feasibility exothermic or endothermic nature the graph of log kc vs t was plotted to analyse the thermodynamic behaviour and is depicted in fig 7 c and d for fusarium subglutinans rdfp and fusarium subglutinans padfp thermodynamic parameters δsº δhº and δgº for cr vi ions adsorption onto mixed biomasses were tabulated in table 1 energy release due to adherence of cr vi ions onto mixed biomasses surface is inferred from the negative δhº values it stipulates the exothermic nature of chromium ions adsorption the maximum percentage removal of cr vi ions onto mixed biomasses was observed at 303 k due to exothermic in nature keep on increasing the temperature up to 333 k results weakening of ionic bonds between the cr vi ions and the positively charged functional groups on the mixed biomass surface which results lower percentage removal of cr vi ions from the negative values of δsº it is apparent that there is a decreased movement between chromium ions with rdfp and padfp spontaneous nature of the chromium ions onto mixed biomasses was evident from the negative δgº values from the thermodynamic results it is inferred that adsorption of cr vi ions onto mixed biomasses is spontaneous feasible and exothermic in nature 3 6 influence of initial cr vi ions concentration initial chromium ion concentration has a remarkable role in suppressing the mass transfer resistance by providing required driving forces experiments were conducted with different cr vi ions concentration 25 150 mg l with ph value of 4 and an adsorbent dosage of 6 g l for fusarium subglutinans rdfp biomass and 3 5 g l for fusarium subglutinans padfp biomass the effect of initial adsorbate concentration on adsorption system is portrayed in fig 8 a the figure shows the decline in chromium removal with improving initial concentration of chromium ions increased cr vi ions competition for limited number of active locates on the mixed biomass surface have resulted in reduced removal of it hence initial chromium ion solution of low concentration 25 mg l is more preferable for the maximal removal of chromium ions 3 7 modeling of batch adsorption isotherm data type of interaction such as monolayer or heterogeneous nature of interaction between chromium ions and mixed biomass molecules is determined by adsorption isotherm studies langmuir freundlich temkin sips and toth isotherm models were used to analyse the equilibrium data for chromium ions adsorption onto mixed biomasses fig 8 b and c represents the plot of qe vs ce for both mixed biomasses isotherm parameters for cr vi ions adsorption onto fusarium subglutinans rdfp and fusarium subglutinans padfp were listed in table 2a the best fitting model among five models would be chosen based on high r2 values and low sse and rmse values from the langmuir isotherm maximum adsorption capacity of mixed biomasses was found to be 11 mg g and 16 52 mg g for fusarium subglutinans rdfp and fusarium subglutinans padfp respectively freundlich isotherm model was used to determine whether the adsorption process is heterogeneous in nature the low r2 values confirmed the absence of multilayer adsorptive nature of the mixed biomasses indirect interactions between adsorbent and adsorbate molecules can be predicted from temkin isotherm from the temkin plot shown in fig 8 b and c temkin parameter values were calculated as follows at 103 9 l g b 0 8374 j mol for fusarium subglutinans rdfp and at 114 4 l g b 0 5729 j mol for fusarium subglutinans padfp this value is the indication of the heat of sorption which confirmed that the adsorption of cr vi ions onto mixed biomasses was follows physisorption mechanism because of the low r2 value 0 8008 and 0 8902 temkin model is the not well fitted isotherm model for the present adsorption system toth and sips isotherm is a three parameter model used for the prediction of heterogeneous nature of adsorption process the calculated sips model parameters are listed in the table 2a for cr vi ion adsorption onto mixed biomasses as follows ks 16 43 l g αs 0 9249 l g βs 0 6724 and r2 0 8699 for fusarium subglutinans rdfp and ks 11 62 l g αs 0 8906 l g βs 0 5147 and r2 0 9195 for fusarium subglutinans padfp these values indicated that the adsorption of cr vi ions was homogeneous in nature the lower r2 value of sips and toth 0 85 and 0 8926 for fusarium subglutinans rdfp and fusarium subglutinans padfp respectively isotherm model denoted that these models are not well fitted isotherm models for cr vi ion adsorption onto mixed biomasses based on high correlation coefficient values and low error values langmuir model was observed to be a best suiting model for the present adsorption system with r2 value of 0 9414 and 0 9304 error values of sse 3 47 and 2 781 rmse 0 835 and 0 395 for rdfp and padfp mixed fungal biomass therefore the langmuir model explains the adsorption of cr vi ions onto the mixed biomasses was homogeneous in nature the adsorption effectiveness of padfp mixed biomass was found superior to rdfp mixed fungal sorbent and isotherms for both the mixed biosorbents is of the following order langmuir sips toth temkin freundlich isotherm the obtained maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of the mixed biomasses was compared with different adsorbents previously used for cr vi ions adsorption and enumerated in table 2b from the table 2b higher qm value was evident that mixed biomasses has distinguished adsorption capability for cr vi ions adsorption 3 8 influence of contact time adsorption potential of mixed biosorbents is greatly influenced by contact time of the adsorption process batch experiments were performed with varied contact time 10 90 min in different concentrations of cr vi ions concentrations 25 150 mg l fig 9 a and b displays the time profile of cr vi ions adsorption onto rdfp and padfp mixed fungal biomass at the initial time abundant number of active sites for cr vi ions binding have resulted in increased adsorption from contact time of 10 min 60 min and also increased removal was observed with low concentration due to the adequate active sites on the biosorbent surface however after a determined contact time period persistent removal was noted due to saturation of active locates on the mixed biomass surface the ideal time for the cr vi ions adsorption onto rdfp and padfp mixed biomass was noted to be 60 min 3 9 modeling of batch adsorption kinetic data in order to study the mechanism of adsorption process adsorption kinetic studies were conducted three different adsorption kinetic models pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich kinetic models were used to fit the obtained experimental data these data were plotted by the graph qt vs t and is depicted in fig 9 c and d for fusarium subglutinans rdfp and fusarium subglutinans padfp respectively the kinetic parameters for cr vi ions adsorption onto rdfp and padfp mixed fungal biomass was listed in table 3 the percentage removal of chromium ions drops with escalating concentration with respect to different contact time due to high competition of chromium ions on the mixed biomasses surface the best fitted kinetic model was chosen based on the correlation coefficient r2 value as well as the difference between the calculated qe values and the experimental qe value elovich kinetic model can be used to infer the chemisorption of ions onto heterogeneous surface however due to low correlation coefficient values it is not considered to be best model for the present adsorption system from the table 3 it can be inferred that pseudo first order kinetic model to be a best fitting model for adsorption of cr vi ions based on high r2 values and then its calculated qe value was very close to the experimental qe value than the other two kinetic models it also infers the chemical nature of cr vi ions adsorption onto rdfp and padfp mixed fungal biomass from the kinetic results it was confirmed that the pseudo first order kinetic model to be a best fitting model and the adsorption of cr vi ions onto the mixed biomasses follows physical adsorption process 4 conclusion in the present research cr vi ions adsorption capability of the synthesized mixed biomasses using fusarium subglutinans and dragon fruit wastes raw and pyrolysis assisted dragon fruit peel was studied characterization studies confirms that the prepared biosorbent material has better surface properties towards cr vi ions adsorption different adsorption influencing parameters were optimized as follows by the batch adsorption studies ph 4 0 mixed biomass dose 6 0 g l of fusarium subglutinans rdfp and 3 5 g l of fusarium subglutinans padfp 303 k temperature and 60 min contact time from modeling studies it was found that langmuir isotherm model and pseudo first order kinetic model was established to be an appropriate model for cr vi ions adsorption using mixed biomasses the maximum monolayer cr vi ions adsorption capacity qm of the synthesized mixed biomasses was estimated to be 11 mg g and 16 52 mg g for fusarium subglutinans rdfp biomass and fusarium subglutinans padfp biomass respectively thermodynamic study reveals that the adsorption of cr vi ions by the mixed biomasses was feasible spontaneous and exothermic in nature from these observations present study concluded that the mixed biomasses has substantial potentiality for cr vi ions adsorption due to superior surface properties including large surface area higher number of pores and availability of essential function groups mixed biomass of fusarium subglutinans padfp shows better cr vi ions adsorption results at lower adsorbent dose 3 5 g l than fusarium subglutinans rdfp because of the waste based adsorbent materials used in this study process was practically more feasible and applicable for heavy metal removal from the wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest 
13618,pollutants such as pesticides find their way into wastewater treatment plants wwtps wwtps have been reported to be unable to fully remove these pesticides from water hence research has been conducted in the development of methods to degrade them in wastewater this work reports the coupling of biological and photocatalytic processes to particularly treat two model pesticides atrazine and tebuthiuron in aqueous solution liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy mass spectroscopy lc ms ms was used as an advanced analytical technique for the identification of both atrazine and tebuthiuron and their degradation by products the lcms ms data showed that atrazine and tebuthiuron were only removed substantially during their first treatment days based on lcms ms results biodegradation of atrazine in the biological treatment section was via dealkylation to yield deethylatrazine m z 198 2 dechlorination to yield n isopropylammelide m z 156 and 3 deamination to yield cyanuric acid m z 129 there were no identified metabolites of tebuthiuron which suggested its structural stability but a decrease was observed at the beginning of the treatment of the pollutant probably due to adsorption on the sludge photocatalysis further reduced the concentration of atrazine while there was no significant decrease in tebuthiuron the atrazine degradation pathways that were identified during photocatalysis studies were 1 degradation of atrazine ciet m z 216 through the formation of hydroxyatrazine oeit m z 197 desethylhydroxyatrazine oiat m z 155 ammeline oaat m z 127 and cyanuric acid ooot m z 129 and 2 the degradation of atrazine after the formation hydroxyatrazine oeit m z 197 could also proceed to form deethylatrazine ciaa m z 198 followed by the formation of n isopropylammelide iat 156 and finally cyanuric acid ooot m z 129 the bio photodegradation treatment process was efficient for the removal of atrazine but not for the removal of tebuthiuron keywords biological treatment photocatalysis atrazine tebuthiuron lcms ms 1 introduction human activity and industrial development have led to the transfer of pesticides into the environment through a vast number of point sources among these point sources are conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps which fail to completely degrade these pesticides and hence are released with effluent into nearby water bodies such as rivers and small water streams 1 the entry of pesticides into conventional wwtps is through the cleaning of containers used to keep the pesticides and application equipment as well as wastewater from agriculture and pesticides manufacturing plants 2 in a study by rott et al 3 wastewater from a pesticide processing plant was found to have pesticides concentrations in the mgl 1 range chavan et al 4 reported that pretreated wastewater from a pesticide formulating plant had a high concentrations of organochlorine pesticides greater than the standard values some of the widely used pesticides include atrazine and tebuthiuron which are used for controlling a wide variety of broad leaf and grassy weeds 5 and controlling woody plants non selectively 6 respectively atrazine and tebuthiuron have a low rate of biodegradability atrazine was reported to have a half life in the aqueous phase and groundwater resources ranging from 41 to 237 days and 15 months to 20 years 5 tebuthiuron breaks down slowly in the soil and remains toxic for a considerable period because of its chemical stability this herbicide has a reported half life of one year in areas that receive 1000 1500 mm rainfall per year 6 thus there are concerns about the contamination of water resources by these herbicides in south africa atrazine was among the detected pesticides in river and tap water in three catchments letsitele lomati and vals renoster in a study by 7 a critical finding of this study showed high exposure of the pesticides including atrazine because they were detected in tap water of a primary school in lomati catchment 7 tebuthiuron was also detected in reclaimed potable water in south africa johannesburg and durban 8 this is concerning especially because atrazine and tebuthiuron are known to be endocrine disruptors 7 9 the biological treatment of atrazine has been reported in several studies can insert some references here baghapour et al 10 reported the removal of atrazine from the aquatic environment using submerged biological aerated filter that was fed with synthetic wastewater based on sucrose and atrazine they achieved maximum efficiencies for atrazine and soluble chemical oxygen demand cod of 97 9 and 98 9 respectively recently kamaz et al 11 reported the removal of atrazine from municipal wastewater using a membrane bioreactor for this study they used real and synthetic wastewater as well as sludge from two wastewater treatment facilities in the united states in norman oklahoma and fayetteville the study indicated that about 20 of the atrazine was removed by adsorption onto the particulate matter while significant removal of atrazine was only observed under aerobic conditions there were no similar studies for the biodegradation of tebuthiuron another effective treatment method for organic pollutants is the advanced oxidation processes aops which uses heterogeneous photocatalysis one of their major drawbacks is high operation costs the utilization of renewable energy such as sunlight as the radiation source to enable photocatalysis has been proposed as a cost cutting measure 12 heterogeneous photocatalysis of pesticides has been widely reported in literature where there was significant reduction in the pesticide concentrations photocatalysis of tebuthiuron propham and propachlor using tio2 was reported by muneer et al 13 in this work propham was found to degrade faster than propachlor and tebuthiuron atrazine photodegradation was illustrated by shamsedini et al 5 using fe 3 tio2 nanoparticles which showed 99 47 removal efficiency furthermore in our previous study we reported an efficient removal of atrazine from synthetic aqueous solution using a heterojunction of bismuth vanadate and bismuth oxide where over 90 of atrazine was degraded 14 studies have shown that combined biological and advanced oxidation processes aops have the potential to completely degrade organic pollutants including pesticides and reduce treatment costs 1 strategies for the combination of biological processes and aops include sequencing the treatment processes depending on the wastewater to be treated therefore the sequence may be the aop then the biological process or the biological process followed by the aop syazrin et al 15 developed two phenol treatment approaches photo biodegradation and bio photodegradation in the photo biodegradation sequence nearly 70 of the initial 50 ppm of phenol was removed within 6 h whereas the bio photodegradation sequence removed 81 phenol removal the bio photodegradation used the composite tio2 zno n as a photocatalyst and mixed microbial consortia in the biodegradation part recently bivo4 has attracted attention due to its optical structural and morphological properties that produce superior photoactivity in different photocatalytic reactions additionally this material can form composites that can be linked to proper control of its morphology to improve photocatalytic activities the morphological control permits the synthesis of several crystal facet exposed with greater photoactivity 16 this photocatalyst is also classified as non toxic 17 19 bismuth oxide on the other hand was a perfect candidate for the formation of a heterojunction because of its visible light activity 20 similarly to bivo4 21 24 according to a materials safety data sheet 25 bi2o3 is not classified as acutely toxic signifying low toxicity the choice of these nanoparticles over ultraviolet active nanoparticles such as zno and tio2 is their visible light activity in this study the efficiency of the combination of biological and photocatalytic bio photocatalytic treatment processes particularly for the removal of atrazine and tebuthiuron from aqueous solution was investigated this work seeks to add on the literature available as proof of concept for the removal of pesticides using a combined photocatalysis and biological processes the two pesticides were chosen because they are part of the reported water pollutants in south africa and are known to have prolonged availability in the environment 26 atrazine has a low rate of biodegradation thus presents a long term threat to the environment 27 similarly tebuthiuron has the propensity to be a long term threat to the environment due to its great stability as it has a long half life 28 29 2 materials and methods 2

photoreactor were a heterojunction of bivo4 bi2o3 that was reported in two of our publications 14 21 particularly to the photocatalyst used in this study the work reported on the synthesis of bivo4 bi2o3 in our previous study revealed the formation of platelet like bivo4 nanoparticles with 010 exposed crystal facets via a hydrothermal method using hyperbranched polyethyleneimine as a template for synthesis 21 these were then fused with bi2o3 to form a p n junction thus providing special separation of charged species to permit the formation of hydroxyl and superoxide radicals which are capable of directly degrading organic pollutants in water 14 2 3 methods 2 4 activated sludge system and operation parameters the activated sludge system consisted of a 20 l holding tank for the influent an aeration chamber of 3 l working volume with the activated sludge a clarifier settling tank of 1 5 l working volume and an effluent holding tank of 10 l working volume fig 1 activated sludge was sourced from an aerobic operation at daspoort wastewater treatment works pretoria south africa at the time it was collected the sludge age was at 4 5 days the aeration tank had a water jacket which was connected to a water bath txf200 grant united kingdom to keep the temperature between 20 25 c an elaborate operation of the treatment process is explained in the supplementary information si briefly wastewater was pumped from the holding tank into the aeration tank where activated sludge uses it as nutrients for growth and to clean the wastewater in the process the mixed liquor activated sludge and aqueous solution is transferred into the clarifier where the activated sludge solids are separated from the water through gravity the water is collected as effluent the activated sludge solids settle towards the bottom of the clarifier and are recycled back into the aeration tank as return activated sludge ras occasionally the activated sludge is wasted as waste activated sludge was to create room for growth of the microbes in the activated sludge as they metabolize the nutrients in the wastewater the activated sludge unit was simulated according to the guideline 303a 30 before the pesticides were treated the activated sludge system was acclimatized to simulated wastewater as elaborated in the si the simulated wastewater was formulated using the materials listed in table s1 si and tap water that was let to stand in the open for more than 12 h this was to allow any traces of chlorine to bubble out simulated wastewater was chosen over real wastewater to have control of the concentration of the pesticides to be treated without running a background check of the pollutants in the water atrazine and tebuthiuron 4 ppm 0 0185 mm and 0 0175 mm respectively were added to the simulated wastewater after acclimatization for their treatment methanol 5 ml was used to first dissolve the pesticides before being added into the simulated wastewater to achieve a homogeneous mixture the pesticides were treated separately beginning with atrazine and then tebuthiuron where they were added for 4 days during sludge retention time srt 6 and 8 respectively acclimatization of the activated sludge to wastewater was conducted for 25 days five sludge retention times srts as shown by fig 3 and elaborated in the si before the treatment of tebuthiuron new simulated wastewater was fed to remove atrazine from the system at srt 7 during acclimatization and treatment of the pesticides the solution in the holding tank was changed every 12 h at 6 pm and 6 a m effluent wastewater during acclimatization was sampled for analysis and the remainder was discarded in a designated waste tank during the treatment of the pesticides it was transferred into a recirculation batch photocatalytic reactor for further treatment several parameters were used to monitor the process of treatment of the influent tests were conducted to determine chemical oxygen demand cod mixed liquor suspended solids mlsss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvsss total suspended solids tss ph dissolved oxygen do and sludge volume index svi the mlsss mlvsss do and svi were used to monitor the welfare of the activated sludge in the aeration tank while the cod was to check the efficiency of the treatment process the ph was measured to ensure the wastewater ph was in the range 7 0 0 5 a spectrophotometer spectroquant pharo 300 merck south africa was used to measure cod using a kit 1 14541 0001 merck which was analogous to a german standard din en iso 7383 the samples to be tested for cod were filtered using 0 45 μm pvdf syringe filter discs merck south africa sections 2540d and 2540e of standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater were used to measure mlsss and mlvsss respectively 31 total suspended solids were measured similar to mlss using method 2540d to calculate the svi 500 ml of fresh wasted activated sludge was was sampled and added into a 1000 ml of a measuring cylinder effluent was then added to the mark after which it was stirred and then allowed to settle for 30 min the volume of the settled sludge was recorded the svi was then computed from eq 1 1 s v i m l g s e t t l e d s l u d g e v o l u m e m l l m l s s m g l x 1000 2 4 1 recirculating batch photocatalytic reactor the recirculating batch photocatalytic reactor was a 5 l working volume unit connected to a reservoir of 10 l working volume fig 2 the connection of the photocatalytic unit was a closed loop system recirculating batch reactor a lamp used as a light source was situated at the top of the photocatalytic reactor placed in a borosilicate glass water jacket that was protruding into the photocatalytic reactor cylinder the lamp was a mercury visible light 250 w high pressure bulb operated using a 250 w and 230 v ac power supply unit a tfx200 water bath grant united kingdom was connected to the water jacket of the lamp and constantly supplied with ice to maintain the temperature at 20 25 c a cardboard box was provided to keep the 5 l unit in the dark and prevent the visible light from escaping to the external environment the reservoir was continuously stirred using a rw 20 digital stirrer ika germany to keep the nanoparticles nps suspended this reactor was used for the degradation of atrazine and tebuthiuron after biological treatment using an activated sludge system the water was analyzed for the concentration of atrazine or tebuthiuron after the biological treatment after the treated water effluent from the activated sludge system was collected it was transferred into the reservoir of the recirculating batch photocatalytic reactor and pumped using a 323s peristaltic pump at 400 rpm until the water filled the reactor and recirculated in the photocatalytic reactor 10 l of effluent water from the activated sludge system was treated using 20 mg of nanoparticles nps the nps used were hyperbranched polyethyleneimine templated bivo4 nps fused with bi2o3 which were prepared as reported in our previous publications 14 21 photocatalytic experiments were conducted for 1 h with samples collected at 0 5 10 and thereafter at 10 min intervals for a total of 60 min the solution was first stirred for 30 min in the dark before the radiation source was switched on before the analysis of atrazine or tebuthiuron in the samples they were filtered using a 0 45 μm syringe filters to sieve the nps 2 5 pesticides quantification analysis a triple quad lc ms ms 8030 instrument from shimadzu corporation south africa with a nexera uhplc upgrade capable of obtaining 500 multiple reaction monitoring readings per second was used to monitor the resultant intermediates the instrument had an oven that was maintained at 40 c and equipped with a raptor arc 18 column from restek corporation usa of 2 7 μm of particle size 2 1 mm internal diameter and 100 mm length isocratic elution was employed using the mobile phase formulated in the ratio 9 1 using 0 1 formic acid in ultrapure water and methanol respectively a full scan mode of 12 min run time was used to collect lc and ms ms data for degradation intermediates at a flow rate of 0 3 ml min 1 under positive ionization mode the percentage removal of the pesticides was calculated using eq 2 2 r e m o v a l c 0 c c 0 x 100 where c0 mgl 1 and c mgl 1 are the initial and final concentration respectively the reaction kinetics were determined from a pseudo first order fit using eq 3 3 in c 0 c k t where c0 and c are the concentrations mgl 1 at time 0 and t and k is the rate constant min 1 photonic efficiencies were calculated using rate constants computed from a fit using equation s1 in conjunction with actinometry calculations analyzed in mm concentrations fig a7 8 chemical oxygen demand cod was determined in the activated sludge system monitoring using the merck 1 14541 0001 kit and the spectroquant pharo 300 the cod reduction during biological and photocatalysis were calculated using eq 2 but at concentrations measured in mgl 1 total percentage cod removal using the combined systems was computed using eq 4 4 t o t a l c o d r e m o v a l c i c f c i x 100 where ci is the cod concentration mgl 1 of the simulated wastewater dosed with the pesticide atrazine or tebuthiuron before biological treatment and cf is the final cod concentration after photocatalysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 acclimatization the main purpose of this study was to treat atrazine and tebuthiuron using combined biological and photocatalytic processes therefore to eliminate variability in the biological treatment process acclimatization to reach a steady state was necessary so that the treatment of atrazine and tebuthiuron and only their influence in the system would be understood properly the cod removal shown in fig 3 a illustrates the acclimatization of activated sludge to synthetic wastewater sww conducted for 25 days five sludge retention times srts at day 11 15 srt 3 the activated sludge system was already being fed with 100 sww acclimatization is important in wastewater treatment processes because it improves the activity and ability of microorganisms in activated sludge to handle toxic contaminants 32 at srt 4 5 the activated sludge system was fed with 100 sww to reach a steady state of the cod removal before the addition of pesticides atrazine or tebuthiuron the survival of the microorganisms was monitored using chemical oxygen demand cod mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss fig 3 table a2 in supplementary information has all the monitored parameters during acclimatization furthermore the sludge volume index svi and total suspended solids tss were measured to gather information about the sludge settling characteristics especially during the treatment of the pesticides table a2 dissolved oxygen do and ph were system parameters that were necessary for the treatment process operation the methods in which these parameters were measured are presented in the si the oecd 303a stipulates that the test substance can be dosed to the system when it has stabilized and removing about 80 of the organic medium 30 it can be observed in fig 3 a that the cod removal increased from below 60 to 80 at srt 3 the cod removal stabilized at 80 at srt 4 5 this signified that the microbes in the sludge were acclimatizing well to the influent that was being dosed as stated in the oecd 303a in previous acclimatization experiments that were conducted elsewhere in our work it was observed that the sww formulation mimics domestic wastewater thus the srt days were set at 5 days instead of 7 10 days as previously reported 33 36 riffat 37 reported that an srt of 5 6 days can be set for temperatures about 10 c thus it can be seen in table a2 that the temperature of the system was successfully maintained at 20 25 c making the 5 days enough for each srt to understand the welfare and growth of the activated sludge microorganisms mlss and mlvss measurements were conducted in fig 3 b the mlss and mlvss are shown for part of the acclimatization and steady state stages of the treatment process srt 3 5 the expected value of mlss when a wastewater treatment plant is operating at optimum is 2500 mg l 1 and the ratio of mlvss to mlss m l v s s m l s s should be 0 75 35 36 38 it can be observed from fig 3 b and table a2 that the mlss increased from 1100 mgl 1 at srt 3 to values above 2500 mg l 1 at srt 5 this increase signified a healthy environment for the microbes in the sludge to grow from these results together with the cod removal of 80 it was noted that the acclimatization of the activated sludge to sww had been achieved before the addition of the test pollutants atrazine or tebuthiuron the m l v s s m l s s at srt 5 ranged between 0 92 0 94 which was a value above the recommended 0 75 as expected this signified that the activated sludge was made entirely of organic matter since sww was used instead of real wastewater which would contain suspended solids such as sand 34 39 another useful parameter svi was computed to study the efficiency of the wastewater treatment process it is a useful calculation that accounts for a 30 minute settleability and activated sludge mlss test to give a number or index that explains the capability of sludge to settle and compact 40 the general guidelines are that svi 80 mlg 1 or less indicates that the sludge is dense and has fast settling characteristics signifying flocs that have particles that are dense and granular an svi 100 200 mlg 1 is characteristic of most activated sludge treatment plants and produces a clear and good quality effluent at this svi range the sludge settles more slowly and traps more particulate matter because of its irregular shaped floc particles with some filaments forming a backbone for floc forming bacteria to attach and colonize 40 during acclimatization and the steady state stage stage where removal of cod is steady and efficient of the activated sludge system it was observed that the svi values showed overall good settling capabilities of the activated sludge table a2 during srt 3 the svi values were between 105 291 mlg 1 and during srt 5 they were between 93 3 124 mglg 1 this was also observed on the tss measurements of the effluent whereby the tss in the effluent was reduced to an average 8 32 mg l 1 at srt 5 from an average 19 1 mg l 1 at srt 2 thus these measurements further showed that the microbes were striving in a healthy environment therefore well acclimatized the ph of the influent at acclimatization and steady state was within the acceptable limits for an efficient treatment process table a2 the effluent ph was also within the acceptable local limit for effluent from wastewater treatment 41 which should be between ph 6 5 8 5 microbial organisms that are active in wastewater treatment are efficient at a ph between 7 8 neutral to slightly alkaline 42 furthermore in acidic media the hydrogen ions can destroy the cell wall of the microbes 35 thus the ph levels shown in table a2 also permitted a healthy environment for the growth of the microbes in the sludge during the treatment process the do levels were still within the stipulated value of 2 mgl 1 30 to achieve enough oxygen needed for the microbial oxidation of organic pollutants in the water in an aerobic activated sludge system thus these monitored parameters further confirmed that the treatment system was operating at an optimum and provided a healthy environment for the growth of microbes before the addition of the test pollutants 3 2 biological treatment of atrazine and tebuthiuron the treatment of atrazine and tebuthiuron was conducted at srt 6 day 27 30 and srt 8 day 37 30 after acclimatization fig 4 shows the cod removal mlss and mlvss measurements during the treatment of the pollutants the addition of atrazine decreased the cod removal from 90 in day 26 to 75 in day 27 fig 4 a this probably signified a shock toxicity to the microbes in the activated sludge which were not acclimatized to it and possibly prevented their growth therefore reducing the removal of cod the mlss results further showed a possible poisoning of the microbes which should metabolize the organics and lower the cod due to the observed decrease to values below 2000 mg l 1 fig 4 b and table a3 the overall biodegradation of the atrazine by the activated sludge was not satisfactory as indicated in fig 5 a during day 2 of srt 6 day 27 the biodegradation of atrazine was observed to be substantial from the lcms ms results but as the treatment continued srt 6 day 28 30 the biodegradation of the atrazine decreased perhaps due to the toxicity of atrazine to the microbes in the activated sludge fig 5 a as also confirmed by the reduction of the mlss or mlvss values fig 4 b and table a3 possibly the concentration of the atrazine during the treatment process was too high for the amount of time the treatment was conducted thus the need to acclimatize the microbes to this compound to increase their efficiency after day 30 the inclusion of atrazine in the wastewater was stopped and the system was operated for another 5 days day 31 35 srt 7 to washout or remove all the atrazine in the system before the addition of tebuthiuron at day 37 40 the srt 7 improved the mlss and mlvss values before the treatment of the tebuthiuron as observed in day 32 35 of fig 4 b the cod removal was observed to be maintained at 75 the cod removal during the treatment of tebuthiuron showed a similar trend to the removal during the treatment of atrazine whereby the cod reduction was around 75 fig 4 a it was worth noting that on day 38 the pollutant seemed to have greatly affected the efficiency of the system because the cod removal dropped from about 70 to about 65 this also signified possible toxicity of tebuthiuron to the microbes in the activated sludge as the mlss or mlvss values decreased significantly as well day 37 of srt 8 fig 4 b the lcms ms measurement of the tebuthiuron concentration in the influent and effluent also showed a similar trend to the biodegradation of atrazine except at day 40 where the effluent concentration tebuthiuron was above the influent concentration which was probably because of an accumulation of the pollutant in the system fig 5 b the accumulation could be caused by the recirculation of activated sludge that occurs during the operation of the activated sludge system fig 1 because of reduced biodegradation but due to the difference between the influent and effluent being within the uncertainty bar the difference might not be significant furthermore the atrazine and tebuthiuron results showed the need to acclimatize the microbes in the activated sludge to new pollutants in wastewater treatment plants a vast number of pesticides could leave with the effluent due to inefficient biodegradation because microbes need to acclimatize to them in literature it has been reported that conventional wastewater treatment plants fail to completely biodegrade some contaminants of emerging concern cecs including pesticides 43 46 which was also seen in this study as seen in table a3 atrazine did not have much effect on the settleability as the svi values were still within 100 200 mlg 1 40 a great increase in the svi to above 200 mlg 1 was observed after the addition of the tebuthiuron which meant the settleability was affected this was confirmed by the decrease of mlss and mlvss table a3 and fig 4 b and the increase of the tss in the effluent table a3 srt 8 elevated svi values normally svi 250 mlg 1 mean the activated sludge compacts poorly and settles very slowly 40 during the treatment of tebuthiuron the activated sludge color changed from brown to dark grey as shown in fig 6 a the dark grey color of sludge is reported to indicate low oxygen levels in the system due to an increased organic load and a presence of slow growing filamentous organisms usually corresponding to norcardia genus 47 48 to solve this problem the do was increased in the aeration tank by doubling the compressed airflow rate fig 6b increasing the do did not however improve the tss as shown in table a3 srt 8 the addition of tebuthiuron on the influent increased the cod of the influent to above 300 mg l 1 table a3 srt 8 fragments of atrazine and tebuthiuron were identified from effluent sampled in day 29 and 30 of srt 6 for atrazine and day 39 and 40 for tebuthiuron using m z graphs from lc ms ms fig a1 shows the m z graphs with information about the fragmentation of atrazine by the activated sludge system the suggested biodegradation pathway was 1 dealkylation to yield deethylatrazine m z 198 2 dechlorination to yield n isopropylammelide m z 156 and 3 deamination to yield cyanuric acid m z 129 in literature it has been reported that several indigenous soil atrazine catabolizing microbial associations and monocultures have been isolated in compromised sites a reference strain pseudomonas sp adp was used to elucidate sequences of catabolic enzymes atza atzb atzc and atzd which are involved in one aerobic degradation pathway 49 thus due to the aerobic nature of the activated sludge system used this was a probable pathway for the fragmentation of atrazine this degradation was efficient during the first days of adding atrazine and thereafter the degradation reduced drastically the lcms ms data for the biodegradation experiment of tebuthiuron showed that the activated sludge failed to degrade the pesticide or the intermediate compounds might have been fully degraded fig a2 shows the m z spectra of the effluent on day 39 and 40 the removal observed at day 37 and 38 could be due to the adsorption of the pesticide to activated sludge fig 5 b this could be another removal mechanism for atrazine at day 27 fig 5 a this is consistent with results obtained by valickova et al 50 where they reported the removal of selected pesticides by activated sludge even though there are a few peaks that appeared apart from m z 229 fig a2 after a literature search no information was available to link them to tebuthiuron perhaps a combination of gcms ms with lcms ms could provide a more elaborate approach at identifying these peaks 3 3 photocatalytic degradation of atrazine and tebuthiuron the photocatalytic experiments were conducted using effluent from day 30 and 40 for further treatment of atrazine and tebuthiuron respectively fig 7 shows pseudo first order reaction kinetics plot of atrazine and tebuthiuron using 0 15hpei 0 5nacl bivo4 bi2o3 further photodegradation of the effluent from the biodegradation removed 70 of atrazine and 5 of tebuthiuron the rate constants in fig 7 2 19 10 2 min 1 and 0 0957 10 2 min 1 for atrazine and tebuthiuron degradation further illustrate that the degradation of atrazine was greatly efficient than that of tebuthiuron the difficulty in degrading tebuthiuron was also confirmed during the photocatalysis studies which could be because of the structural robustness of the compound furthermore tebuthiuron is reported to be stable even when exposed to light 51 in our reported work 14 atrazine was illustrated to be degraded in the mg l 1 concentration range which was also observed in these results when comparing the structures of atrazine and tebuthiuron it can be noted that atrazine fig 8 a has a good leaving group cl compared to tebuthiuron fig 8b this leaving group could be an initiator of the degradation of atrazine while in tebuthiuron the groups are very stable furthermore atrazine has other better leaving groups attached to the 1 3 5 triazine ring compared to those attached to the tebuthiuron 1 3 4 thiadiazole ring the good leaving groups in atrazine allow for its photodegradation to form cyanuric acid which stabilized by the 1 3 5 triazine aromatic ring tebuthiuron is more structurally stable compared to atrazine thus more refractory to be cleaved the stability of tebuthiuron has also been reported in environmental exposure studies and showed to be higher than that of atrazine mercurio et al 28 simulated 12 months degradation experiments in large open tanks under different light scenarios in the presence and absence of natural sediments under dark and no sediment conditions tebuthiuron had a half life of 1766 188 days while atrazine had a 300 13 days half life when diurnal light cycle and coastal sediment conditions were used the half life of tebuthiuron was reduced to 944 52 days while that of atrazine was reduced to 107 7 days showing greater stability of tebuthiuron compared to atrazine the degradation pathway was elucidated using lcms ms data at 0 10 30 50 and 60 min six intermediates were identified from m z plots shown in the supplementary information fig a3 5 from these including atrazine there were suggested two pathways in which atrazine could be degraded fig 9 is an illustration of the identified pathways pathway 1 suggested the degradation of atrazine ciet m z 216 through the formation of hydroxyatrazine oeit m z 197 desethylhydroxyatrazine oiat m z 155 ammeline oaat m z 127 and cyanuric acid ooot m z 129 the atrazine degradation via this pathway starts with dechlorination followed by dealkylation and further deamination this pathway was also observed in our previous publication with a 500 ml reactor which further confirmed this pathway to be a possibility 14 in pathway 2 the intermediates showed that the degradation of atrazine after the formation hydroxyatrazine oeit m z 197 could also proceed to form deethylatrazine ciaa m z 198 via dealkylation followed by the formation of n isopropylammelide iat 156 via deamination and finally cyanuric acid ooot m z 129 via deamination these were postulated to be evolved through dealkylation and two steps of deamination both these pathways arrived at the most stable and less toxic compound cyanuric acid 52 53 lc ms ms data for tebuthiuron degradation showed only the m z 229 which is for tebuthiuron fig a6 8 as explained for fig a2 the peaks that appeared apart from m z 229 could not be linked to tebuthiuron thus the 5 removal of tebuthiuron was observed to be insignificant further optimization of the degradation would include the use of different catalyst concentrations degradation time and using different ph environments the degradation of atrazine was due to photogenerated holes and radical attack by o2 and oh radicals as explained in our previous publication 14 these could be the same species responsible for the degradation of tebuthiuron even though it was minimal from point of zero charge pzc measurements it was observed that there was no interaction between atrazine and 0 15hpei 0 5nacl bivo4 bi2o3 as explained in our recent publication 14 the pzc of the photocatalyst was characterized to be approximately at ph 3 0 therefore the photocatalyst surface charge would be negative at ph above 3 0 as recorded in table a3 the ph of effluent at day 30 was 8 03 thus the surface charge of the photocatalyst during the photodegradation was negative atrazine would be expected to be negative at ph 8 03 because its protonation decreases as the ph approach neutral due to protonation atrazine is known to be positively charged in acidic conditions 54 the pka of atrazine is 1 60 while that of tebuthiuron is 1 20 55 56 which could mean they would acquire almost similar surface charges when exposed to similar ph ranges tebuthiuron is reported to be stable in aqueous media at a ph range 5 9 56 meaning it would be negatively charged at this ph range therefore even though there was minimal photodegradation of tebuthiuron this minimal removal could be attributed to direct hole degradation and radical attack by o2 and oh radicals during the photocatalysis of atrazine and tebuthiuron effluent the percentage removal of cod remaining after biological treatment was 26 7 and 30 7 respectively table a4 it was worth noting that the removal of cod included the organic materials used in the formulation of the simulated wastewater similar results for atrazine were reported in one of our publications 14 where 24 3 was removed by 0 15hpei 0 5nacl bivo4 bi2o3 the combined removal of cod using biological and photocatalytic treatment was 82 4 and 76 6 during the treatment of atrazine and tebuthiuron respectively thus the total cod removal was substantial when using the combined system but minimal during photocatalysis alone the photonic efficiency was computed for the degradation of atrazine and tebuthiuron as the number of the pollutant molecules removed per incident photon the photon flow in the reactor was 0 0864 meinstein min 1l 1 photonic efficiency in the degradation of atrazine and tebuthiuron were 2 32 10 3 and 1 16 10 4 mol einstein 1 respectively the actinometry plot is shown in fig a10 from these results it could be observed that the heterogeneous photodegradation of atrazine was more efficient than tebuthiuron as more moles of atrazine were consumed per einstein than for tebuthiuron 4 conclusions treatment of atrazine and tebuthiuron using the activated sludge system was ineffective there was a need for further treatment using the photocatalytic reactor the compounds were perhaps toxic to the microorganisms in the activated sludge which could have led to the decreased efficiency as the days continued during the treatment this illustrated the need for an elaborate acclimatization of activated sludge to organic pollutants which requires a long time atrazine was effectively further degraded by the photocatalytic reactor but the failure to further degrade tebuthiuron demonstrated a need for more optimization of the treatment process chemical oxygen demand cod was greatly removed when using the combined treatment process thus the photocatalyst used in the photocatalytic reactor has a potential to be used in wastewater treatment even though the treatment of tebuthiuron was unsuccessful more work should be done for its optimization and could be tested using other organic pollutants other than tebuthiuron and atrazine declaration of competing interest the corresponding author confirms that

13618,pollutants such as pesticides find their way into wastewater treatment plants wwtps wwtps have been reported to be unable to fully remove these pesticides from water hence research has been conducted in the development of methods to degrade them in wastewater this work reports the coupling of biological and photocatalytic processes to particularly treat two model pesticides atrazine and tebuthiuron in aqueous solution liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy mass spectroscopy lc ms ms was used as an advanced analytical technique for the identification of both atrazine and tebuthiuron and their degradation by products the lcms ms data showed that atrazine and tebuthiuron were only removed substantially during their first treatment days based on lcms ms results biodegradation of atrazine in the biological treatment section was via dealkylation to yield deethylatrazine m z 198 2 dechlorination to yield n isopropylammelide m z 156 and 3 deamination to yield cyanuric acid m z 129 there were no identified metabolites of tebuthiuron which suggested its structural stability but a decrease was observed at the beginning of the treatment of the pollutant probably due to adsorption on the sludge photocatalysis further reduced the concentration of atrazine while there was no significant decrease in tebuthiuron the atrazine degradation pathways that were identified during photocatalysis studies were 1 degradation of atrazine ciet m z 216 through the formation of hydroxyatrazine oeit m z 197 desethylhydroxyatrazine oiat m z 155 ammeline oaat m z 127 and cyanuric acid ooot m z 129 and 2 the degradation of atrazine after the formation hydroxyatrazine oeit m z 197 could also proceed to form deethylatrazine ciaa m z 198 followed by the formation of n isopropylammelide iat 156 and finally cyanuric acid ooot m z 129 the bio photodegradation treatment process was efficient for the removal of atrazine but not for the removal of tebuthiuron keywords biological treatment photocatalysis atrazine tebuthiuron lcms ms 1 introduction human activity and industrial development have led to the transfer of pesticides into the environment through a vast number of point sources among these point sources are conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps which fail to completely degrade these pesticides and hence are released with effluent into nearby water bodies such as rivers and small water streams 1 the entry of pesticides into conventional wwtps is through the cleaning of containers used to keep the pesticides and application equipment as well as wastewater from agriculture and pesticides manufacturing plants 2 in a study by rott et al 3 wastewater from a pesticide processing plant was found to have pesticides concentrations in the mgl 1 range chavan et al 4 reported that pretreated wastewater from a pesticide formulating plant had a high concentrations of organochlorine pesticides greater than the standard values some of the widely used pesticides include atrazine and tebuthiuron which are used for controlling a wide variety of broad leaf and grassy weeds 5 and controlling woody plants non selectively 6 respectively atrazine and tebuthiuron have a low rate of biodegradability atrazine was reported to have a half life in the aqueous phase and groundwater resources ranging from 41 to 237 days and 15 months to 20 years 5 tebuthiuron breaks down slowly in the soil and remains toxic for a considerable period because of its chemical stability this herbicide has a reported half life of one year in areas that receive 1000 1500 mm rainfall per year 6 thus there are concerns about the contamination of water resources by these herbicides in south africa atrazine was among the detected pesticides in river and tap water in three catchments letsitele lomati and vals renoster in a study by 7 a critical finding of this study showed high exposure of the pesticides including atrazine because they were detected in tap water of a primary school in lomati catchment 7 tebuthiuron was also detected in reclaimed potable water in south africa johannesburg and durban 8 this is concerning especially because atrazine and tebuthiuron are known to be endocrine disruptors 7 9 the biological treatment of atrazine has been reported in several studies can insert some references here baghapour et al 10 reported the removal of atrazine from the aquatic environment using submerged biological aerated filter that was fed with synthetic wastewater based on sucrose and atrazine they achieved maximum efficiencies for atrazine and soluble chemical oxygen demand cod of 97 9 and 98 9 respectively recently kamaz et al 11 reported the removal of atrazine from municipal wastewater using a membrane bioreactor for this study they used real and synthetic wastewater as well as sludge from two wastewater treatment facilities in the united states in norman oklahoma and fayetteville the study indicated that about 20 of the atrazine was removed by adsorption onto the particulate matter while significant removal of atrazine was only observed under aerobic conditions there were no similar studies for the biodegradation of tebuthiuron another effective treatment method for organic pollutants is the advanced oxidation processes aops which uses heterogeneous photocatalysis one of their major drawbacks is high operation costs the utilization of renewable energy such as sunlight as the radiation source to enable photocatalysis has been proposed as a cost cutting measure 12 heterogeneous photocatalysis of pesticides has been widely reported in literature where there was significant reduction in the pesticide concentrations photocatalysis of tebuthiuron propham and propachlor using tio2 was reported by muneer et al 13 in this work propham was found to degrade faster than propachlor and tebuthiuron atrazine photodegradation was illustrated by shamsedini et al 5 using fe 3 tio2 nanoparticles which showed 99 47 removal efficiency furthermore in our previous study we reported an efficient removal of atrazine from synthetic aqueous solution using a heterojunction of bismuth vanadate and bismuth oxide where over 90 of atrazine was degraded 14 studies have shown that combined biological and advanced oxidation processes aops have the potential to completely degrade organic pollutants including pesticides and reduce treatment costs 1 strategies for the combination of biological processes and aops include sequencing the treatment processes depending on the wastewater to be treated therefore the sequence may be the aop then the biological process or the biological process followed by the aop syazrin et al 15 developed two phenol treatment approaches photo biodegradation and bio photodegradation in the photo biodegradation sequence nearly 70 of the initial 50 ppm of phenol was removed within 6 h whereas the bio photodegradation sequence removed 81 phenol removal the bio photodegradation used the composite tio2 zno n as a photocatalyst and mixed microbial consortia in the biodegradation part recently bivo4 has attracted attention due to its optical structural and morphological properties that produce superior photoactivity in different photocatalytic reactions additionally this material can form composites that can be linked to proper control of its morphology to improve photocatalytic activities the morphological control permits the synthesis of several crystal facet exposed with greater photoactivity 16 this photocatalyst is also classified as non toxic 17 19 bismuth oxide on the other hand was a perfect candidate for the formation of a heterojunction because of its visible light activity 20 similarly to bivo4 21 24 according to a materials safety data sheet 25 bi2o3 is not classified as acutely toxic signifying low toxicity the choice of these nanoparticles over ultraviolet active nanoparticles such as zno and tio2 is their visible light activity in this study the efficiency of the combination of biological and photocatalytic bio photocatalytic treatment processes particularly for the removal of atrazine and tebuthiuron from aqueous solution was investigated this work seeks to add on the literature available as proof of concept for the removal of pesticides using a combined photocatalysis and biological processes the two pesticides were chosen because they are part of the reported water pollutants in south africa and are known to have prolonged availability in the environment 26 atrazine has a low rate of biodegradation thus presents a long term threat to the environment 27 similarly tebuthiuron has the propensity to be a long term threat to the environment due to its great stability as it has a long half life 28 29 2 materials and methods 2

photoreactor were a heterojunction of bivo4 bi2o3 that was reported in two of our publications 14 21 particularly to the photocatalyst used in this study the work reported on the synthesis of bivo4 bi2o3 in our previous study revealed the formation of platelet like bivo4 nanoparticles with 010 exposed crystal facets via a hydrothermal method using hyperbranched polyethyleneimine as a template for synthesis 21 these were then fused with bi2o3 to form a p n junction thus providing special separation of charged species to permit the formation of hydroxyl and superoxide radicals which are capable of directly degrading organic pollutants in water 14 2 3 methods 2 4 activated sludge system and operation parameters the activated sludge system consisted of a 20 l holding tank for the influent an aeration chamber of 3 l working volume with the activated sludge a clarifier settling tank of 1 5 l working volume and an effluent holding tank of 10 l working volume fig 1 activated sludge was sourced from an aerobic operation at daspoort wastewater treatment works pretoria south africa at the time it was collected the sludge age was at 4 5 days the aeration tank had a water jacket which was connected to a water bath txf200 grant united kingdom to keep the temperature between 20 25 c an elaborate operation of the treatment process is explained in the supplementary information si briefly wastewater was pumped from the holding tank into the aeration tank where activated sludge uses it as nutrients for growth and to clean the wastewater in the process the mixed liquor activated sludge and aqueous solution is transferred into the clarifier where the activated sludge solids are separated from the water through gravity the water is collected as effluent the activated sludge solids settle towards the bottom of the clarifier and are recycled back into the aeration tank as return activated sludge ras occasionally the activated sludge is wasted as waste activated sludge was to create room for growth of the microbes in the activated sludge as they metabolize the nutrients in the wastewater the activated sludge unit was simulated according to the guideline 303a 30 before the pesticides were treated the activated sludge system was acclimatized to simulated wastewater as elaborated in the si the simulated wastewater was formulated using the materials listed in table s1 si and tap water that was let to stand in the open for more than 12 h this was to allow any traces of chlorine to bubble out simulated wastewater was chosen over real wastewater to have control of the concentration of the pesticides to be treated without running a background check of the pollutants in the water atrazine and tebuthiuron 4 ppm 0 0185 mm and 0 0175 mm respectively were added to the simulated wastewater after acclimatization for their treatment methanol 5 ml was used to first dissolve the pesticides before being added into the simulated wastewater to achieve a homogeneous mixture the pesticides were treated separately beginning with atrazine and then tebuthiuron where they were added for 4 days during sludge retention time srt 6 and 8 respectively acclimatization of the activated sludge to wastewater was conducted for 25 days five sludge retention times srts as shown by fig 3 and elaborated in the si before the treatment of tebuthiuron new simulated wastewater was fed to remove atrazine from the system at srt 7 during acclimatization and treatment of the pesticides the solution in the holding tank was changed every 12 h at 6 pm and 6 a m effluent wastewater during acclimatization was sampled for analysis and the remainder was discarded in a designated waste tank during the treatment of the pesticides it was transferred into a recirculation batch photocatalytic reactor for further treatment several parameters were used to monitor the process of treatment of the influent tests were conducted to determine chemical oxygen demand cod mixed liquor suspended solids mlsss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvsss total suspended solids tss ph dissolved oxygen do and sludge volume index svi the mlsss mlvsss do and svi were used to monitor the welfare of the activated sludge in the aeration tank while the cod was to check the efficiency of the treatment process the ph was measured to ensure the wastewater ph was in the range 7 0 0 5 a spectrophotometer spectroquant pharo 300 merck south africa was used to measure cod using a kit 1 14541 0001 merck which was analogous to a german standard din en iso 7383 the samples to be tested for cod were filtered using 0 45 μm pvdf syringe filter discs merck south africa sections 2540d and 2540e of standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater were used to measure mlsss and mlvsss respectively 31 total suspended solids were measured similar to mlss using method 2540d to calculate the svi 500 ml of fresh wasted activated sludge was was sampled and added into a 1000 ml of a measuring cylinder effluent was then added to the mark after which it was stirred and then allowed to settle for 30 min the volume of the settled sludge was recorded the svi was then computed from eq 1 1 s v i m l g s e t t l e d s l u d g e v o l u m e m l l m l s s m g l x 1000 2 4 1 recirculating batch photocatalytic reactor the recirculating batch photocatalytic reactor was a 5 l working volume unit connected to a reservoir of 10 l working volume fig 2 the connection of the photocatalytic unit was a closed loop system recirculating batch reactor a lamp used as a light source was situated at the top of the photocatalytic reactor placed in a borosilicate glass water jacket that was protruding into the photocatalytic reactor cylinder the lamp was a mercury visible light 250 w high pressure bulb operated using a 250 w and 230 v ac power supply unit a tfx200 water bath grant united kingdom was connected to the water jacket of the lamp and constantly supplied with ice to maintain the temperature at 20 25 c a cardboard box was provided to keep the 5 l unit in the dark and prevent the visible light from escaping to the external environment the reservoir was continuously stirred using a rw 20 digital stirrer ika germany to keep the nanoparticles nps suspended this reactor was used for the degradation of atrazine and tebuthiuron after biological treatment using an activated sludge system the water was analyzed for the concentration of atrazine or tebuthiuron after the biological treatment after the treated water effluent from the activated sludge system was collected it was transferred into the reservoir of the recirculating batch photocatalytic reactor and pumped using a 323s peristaltic pump at 400 rpm until the water filled the reactor and recirculated in the photocatalytic reactor 10 l of effluent water from the activated sludge system was treated using 20 mg of nanoparticles nps the nps used were hyperbranched polyethyleneimine templated bivo4 nps fused with bi2o3 which were prepared as reported in our previous publications 14 21 photocatalytic experiments were conducted for 1 h with samples collected at 0 5 10 and thereafter at 10 min intervals for a total of 60 min the solution was first stirred for 30 min in the dark before the radiation source was switched on before the analysis of atrazine or tebuthiuron in the samples they were filtered using a 0 45 μm syringe filters to sieve the nps 2 5 pesticides quantification analysis a triple quad lc ms ms 8030 instrument from shimadzu corporation south africa with a nexera uhplc upgrade capable of obtaining 500 multiple reaction monitoring readings per second was used to monitor the resultant intermediates the instrument had an oven that was maintained at 40 c and equipped with a raptor arc 18 column from restek corporation usa of 2 7 μm of particle size 2 1 mm internal diameter and 100 mm length isocratic elution was employed using the mobile phase formulated in the ratio 9 1 using 0 1 formic acid in ultrapure water and methanol respectively a full scan mode of 12 min run time was used to collect lc and ms ms data for degradation intermediates at a flow rate of 0 3 ml min 1 under positive ionization mode the percentage removal of the pesticides was calculated using eq 2 2 r e m o v a l c 0 c c 0 x 100 where c0 mgl 1 and c mgl 1 are the initial and final concentration respectively the reaction kinetics were determined from a pseudo first order fit using eq 3 3 in c 0 c k t where c0 and c are the concentrations mgl 1 at time 0 and t and k is the rate constant min 1 photonic efficiencies were calculated using rate constants computed from a fit using equation s1 in conjunction with actinometry calculations analyzed in mm concentrations fig a7 8 chemical oxygen demand cod was determined in the activated sludge system monitoring using the merck 1 14541 0001 kit and the spectroquant pharo 300 the cod reduction during biological and photocatalysis were calculated using eq 2 but at concentrations measured in mgl 1 total percentage cod removal using the combined systems was computed using eq 4 4 t o t a l c o d r e m o v a l c i c f c i x 100 where ci is the cod concentration mgl 1 of the simulated wastewater dosed with the pesticide atrazine or tebuthiuron before biological treatment and cf is the final cod concentration after photocatalysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 acclimatization the main purpose of this study was to treat atrazine and tebuthiuron using combined biological and photocatalytic processes therefore to eliminate variability in the biological treatment process acclimatization to reach a steady state was necessary so that the treatment of atrazine and tebuthiuron and only their influence in the system would be understood properly the cod removal shown in fig 3 a illustrates the acclimatization of activated sludge to synthetic wastewater sww conducted for 25 days five sludge retention times srts at day 11 15 srt 3 the activated sludge system was already being fed with 100 sww acclimatization is important in wastewater treatment processes because it improves the activity and ability of microorganisms in activated sludge to handle toxic contaminants 32 at srt 4 5 the activated sludge system was fed with 100 sww to reach a steady state of the cod removal before the addition of pesticides atrazine or tebuthiuron the survival of the microorganisms was monitored using chemical oxygen demand cod mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss fig 3 table a2 in supplementary information has all the monitored parameters during acclimatization furthermore the sludge volume index svi and total suspended solids tss were measured to gather information about the sludge settling characteristics especially during the treatment of the pesticides table a2 dissolved oxygen do and ph were system parameters that were necessary for the treatment process operation the methods in which these parameters were measured are presented in the si the oecd 303a stipulates that the test substance can be dosed to the system when it has stabilized and removing about 80 of the organic medium 30 it can be observed in fig 3 a that the cod removal increased from below 60 to 80 at srt 3 the cod removal stabilized at 80 at srt 4 5 this signified that the microbes in the sludge were acclimatizing well to the influent that was being dosed as stated in the oecd 303a in previous acclimatization experiments that were conducted elsewhere in our work it was observed that the sww formulation mimics domestic wastewater thus the srt days were set at 5 days instead of 7 10 days as previously reported 33 36 riffat 37 reported that an srt of 5 6 days can be set for temperatures about 10 c thus it can be seen in table a2 that the temperature of the system was successfully maintained at 20 25 c making the 5 days enough for each srt to understand the welfare and growth of the activated sludge microorganisms mlss and mlvss measurements were conducted in fig 3 b the mlss and mlvss are shown for part of the acclimatization and steady state stages of the treatment process srt 3 5 the expected value of mlss when a wastewater treatment plant is operating at optimum is 2500 mg l 1 and the ratio of mlvss to mlss m l v s s m l s s should be 0 75 35 36 38 it can be observed from fig 3 b and table a2 that the mlss increased from 1100 mgl 1 at srt 3 to values above 2500 mg l 1 at srt 5 this increase signified a healthy environment for the microbes in the sludge to grow from these results together with the cod removal of 80 it was noted that the acclimatization of the activated sludge to sww had been achieved before the addition of the test pollutants atrazine or tebuthiuron the m l v s s m l s s at srt 5 ranged between 0 92 0 94 which was a value above the recommended 0 75 as expected this signified that the activated sludge was made entirely of organic matter since sww was used instead of real wastewater which would contain suspended solids such as sand 34 39 another useful parameter svi was computed to study the efficiency of the wastewater treatment process it is a useful calculation that accounts for a 30 minute settleability and activated sludge mlss test to give a number or index that explains the capability of sludge to settle and compact 40 the general guidelines are that svi 80 mlg 1 or less indicates that the sludge is dense and has fast settling characteristics signifying flocs that have particles that are dense and granular an svi 100 200 mlg 1 is characteristic of most activated sludge treatment plants and produces a clear and good quality effluent at this svi range the sludge settles more slowly and traps more particulate matter because of its irregular shaped floc particles with some filaments forming a backbone for floc forming bacteria to attach and colonize 40 during acclimatization and the steady state stage stage where removal of cod is steady and efficient of the activated sludge system it was observed that the svi values showed overall good settling capabilities of the activated sludge table a2 during srt 3 the svi values were between 105 291 mlg 1 and during srt 5 they were between 93 3 124 mglg 1 this was also observed on the tss measurements of the effluent whereby the tss in the effluent was reduced to an average 8 32 mg l 1 at srt 5 from an average 19 1 mg l 1 at srt 2 thus these measurements further showed that the microbes were striving in a healthy environment therefore well acclimatized the ph of the influent at acclimatization and steady state was within the acceptable limits for an efficient treatment process table a2 the effluent ph was also within the acceptable local limit for effluent from wastewater treatment 41 which should be between ph 6 5 8 5 microbial organisms that are active in wastewater treatment are efficient at a ph between 7 8 neutral to slightly alkaline 42 furthermore in acidic media the hydrogen ions can destroy the cell wall of the microbes 35 thus the ph levels shown in table a2 also permitted a healthy environment for the growth of the microbes in the sludge during the treatment process the do levels were still within the stipulated value of 2 mgl 1 30 to achieve enough oxygen needed for the microbial oxidation of organic pollutants in the water in an aerobic activated sludge system thus these monitored parameters further confirmed that the treatment system was operating at an optimum and provided a healthy environment for the growth of microbes before the addition of the test pollutants 3 2 biological treatment of atrazine and tebuthiuron the treatment of atrazine and tebuthiuron was conducted at srt 6 day 27 30 and srt 8 day 37 30 after acclimatization fig 4 shows the cod removal mlss and mlvss measurements during the treatment of the pollutants the addition of atrazine decreased the cod removal from 90 in day 26 to 75 in day 27 fig 4 a this probably signified a shock toxicity to the microbes in the activated sludge which were not acclimatized to it and possibly prevented their growth therefore reducing the removal of cod the mlss results further showed a possible poisoning of the microbes which should metabolize the organics and lower the cod due to the observed decrease to values below 2000 mg l 1 fig 4 b and table a3 the overall biodegradation of the atrazine by the activated sludge was not satisfactory as indicated in fig 5 a during day 2 of srt 6 day 27 the biodegradation of atrazine was observed to be substantial from the lcms ms results but as the treatment continued srt 6 day 28 30 the biodegradation of the atrazine decreased perhaps due to the toxicity of atrazine to the microbes in the activated sludge fig 5 a as also confirmed by the reduction of the mlss or mlvss values fig 4 b and table a3 possibly the concentration of the atrazine during the treatment process was too high for the amount of time the treatment was conducted thus the need to acclimatize the microbes to this compound to increase their efficiency after day 30 the inclusion of atrazine in the wastewater was stopped and the system was operated for another 5 days day 31 35 srt 7 to washout or remove all the atrazine in the system before the addition of tebuthiuron at day 37 40 the srt 7 improved the mlss and mlvss values before the treatment of the tebuthiuron as observed in day 32 35 of fig 4 b the cod removal was observed to be maintained at 75 the cod removal during the treatment of tebuthiuron showed a similar trend to the removal during the treatment of atrazine whereby the cod reduction was around 75 fig 4 a it was worth noting that on day 38 the pollutant seemed to have greatly affected the efficiency of the system because the cod removal dropped from about 70 to about 65 this also signified possible toxicity of tebuthiuron to the microbes in the activated sludge as the mlss or mlvss values decreased significantly as well day 37 of srt 8 fig 4 b the lcms ms measurement of the tebuthiuron concentration in the influent and effluent also showed a similar trend to the biodegradation of atrazine except at day 40 where the effluent concentration tebuthiuron was above the influent concentration which was probably because of an accumulation of the pollutant in the system fig 5 b the accumulation could be caused by the recirculation of activated sludge that occurs during the operation of the activated sludge system fig 1 because of reduced biodegradation but due to the difference between the influent and effluent being within the uncertainty bar the difference might not be significant furthermore the atrazine and tebuthiuron results showed the need to acclimatize the microbes in the activated sludge to new pollutants in wastewater treatment plants a vast number of pesticides could leave with the effluent due to inefficient biodegradation because microbes need to acclimatize to them in literature it has been reported that conventional wastewater treatment plants fail to completely biodegrade some contaminants of emerging concern cecs including pesticides 43 46 which was also seen in this study as seen in table a3 atrazine did not have much effect on the settleability as the svi values were still within 100 200 mlg 1 40 a great increase in the svi to above 200 mlg 1 was observed after the addition of the tebuthiuron which meant the settleability was affected this was confirmed by the decrease of mlss and mlvss table a3 and fig 4 b and the increase of the tss in the effluent table a3 srt 8 elevated svi values normally svi 250 mlg 1 mean the activated sludge compacts poorly and settles very slowly 40 during the treatment of tebuthiuron the activated sludge color changed from brown to dark grey as shown in fig 6 a the dark grey color of sludge is reported to indicate low oxygen levels in the system due to an increased organic load and a presence of slow growing filamentous organisms usually corresponding to norcardia genus 47 48 to solve this problem the do was increased in the aeration tank by doubling the compressed airflow rate fig 6b increasing the do did not however improve the tss as shown in table a3 srt 8 the addition of tebuthiuron on the influent increased the cod of the influent to above 300 mg l 1 table a3 srt 8 fragments of atrazine and tebuthiuron were identified from effluent sampled in day 29 and 30 of srt 6 for atrazine and day 39 and 40 for tebuthiuron using m z graphs from lc ms ms fig a1 shows the m z graphs with information about the fragmentation of atrazine by the activated sludge system the suggested biodegradation pathway was 1 dealkylation to yield deethylatrazine m z 198 2 dechlorination to yield n isopropylammelide m z 156 and 3 deamination to yield cyanuric acid m z 129 in literature it has been reported that several indigenous soil atrazine catabolizing microbial associations and monocultures have been isolated in compromised sites a reference strain pseudomonas sp adp was used to elucidate sequences of catabolic enzymes atza atzb atzc and atzd which are involved in one aerobic degradation pathway 49 thus due to the aerobic nature of the activated sludge system used this was a probable pathway for the fragmentation of atrazine this degradation was efficient during the first days of adding atrazine and thereafter the degradation reduced drastically the lcms ms data for the biodegradation experiment of tebuthiuron showed that the activated sludge failed to degrade the pesticide or the intermediate compounds might have been fully degraded fig a2 shows the m z spectra of the effluent on day 39 and 40 the removal observed at day 37 and 38 could be due to the adsorption of the pesticide to activated sludge fig 5 b this could be another removal mechanism for atrazine at day 27 fig 5 a this is consistent with results obtained by valickova et al 50 where they reported the removal of selected pesticides by activated sludge even though there are a few peaks that appeared apart from m z 229 fig a2 after a literature search no information was available to link them to tebuthiuron perhaps a combination of gcms ms with lcms ms could provide a more elaborate approach at identifying these peaks 3 3 photocatalytic degradation of atrazine and tebuthiuron the photocatalytic experiments were conducted using effluent from day 30 and 40 for further treatment of atrazine and tebuthiuron respectively fig 7 shows pseudo first order reaction kinetics plot of atrazine and tebuthiuron using 0 15hpei 0 5nacl bivo4 bi2o3 further photodegradation of the effluent from the biodegradation removed 70 of atrazine and 5 of tebuthiuron the rate constants in fig 7 2 19 10 2 min 1 and 0 0957 10 2 min 1 for atrazine and tebuthiuron degradation further illustrate that the degradation of atrazine was greatly efficient than that of tebuthiuron the difficulty in degrading tebuthiuron was also confirmed during the photocatalysis studies which could be because of the structural robustness of the compound furthermore tebuthiuron is reported to be stable even when exposed to light 51 in our reported work 14 atrazine was illustrated to be degraded in the mg l 1 concentration range which was also observed in these results when comparing the structures of atrazine and tebuthiuron it can be noted that atrazine fig 8 a has a good leaving group cl compared to tebuthiuron fig 8b this leaving group could be an initiator of the degradation of atrazine while in tebuthiuron the groups are very stable furthermore atrazine has other better leaving groups attached to the 1 3 5 triazine ring compared to those attached to the tebuthiuron 1 3 4 thiadiazole ring the good leaving groups in atrazine allow for its photodegradation to form cyanuric acid which stabilized by the 1 3 5 triazine aromatic ring tebuthiuron is more structurally stable compared to atrazine thus more refractory to be cleaved the stability of tebuthiuron has also been reported in environmental exposure studies and showed to be higher than that of atrazine mercurio et al 28 simulated 12 months degradation experiments in large open tanks under different light scenarios in the presence and absence of natural sediments under dark and no sediment conditions tebuthiuron had a half life of 1766 188 days while atrazine had a 300 13 days half life when diurnal light cycle and coastal sediment conditions were used the half life of tebuthiuron was reduced to 944 52 days while that of atrazine was reduced to 107 7 days showing greater stability of tebuthiuron compared to atrazine the degradation pathway was elucidated using lcms ms data at 0 10 30 50 and 60 min six intermediates were identified from m z plots shown in the supplementary information fig a3 5 from these including atrazine there were suggested two pathways in which atrazine could be degraded fig 9 is an illustration of the identified pathways pathway 1 suggested the degradation of atrazine ciet m z 216 through the formation of hydroxyatrazine oeit m z 197 desethylhydroxyatrazine oiat m z 155 ammeline oaat m z 127 and cyanuric acid ooot m z 129 the atrazine degradation via this pathway starts with dechlorination followed by dealkylation and further deamination this pathway was also observed in our previous publication with a 500 ml reactor which further confirmed this pathway to be a possibility 14 in pathway 2 the intermediates showed that the degradation of atrazine after the formation hydroxyatrazine oeit m z 197 could also proceed to form deethylatrazine ciaa m z 198 via dealkylation followed by the formation of n isopropylammelide iat 156 via deamination and finally cyanuric acid ooot m z 129 via deamination these were postulated to be evolved through dealkylation and two steps of deamination both these pathways arrived at the most stable and less toxic compound cyanuric acid 52 53 lc ms ms data for tebuthiuron degradation showed only the m z 229 which is for tebuthiuron fig a6 8 as explained for fig a2 the peaks that appeared apart from m z 229 could not be linked to tebuthiuron thus the 5 removal of tebuthiuron was observed to be insignificant further optimization of the degradation would include the use of different catalyst concentrations degradation time and using different ph environments the degradation of atrazine was due to photogenerated holes and radical attack by o2 and oh radicals as explained in our previous publication 14 these could be the same species responsible for the degradation of tebuthiuron even though it was minimal from point of zero charge pzc measurements it was observed that there was no interaction between atrazine and 0 15hpei 0 5nacl bivo4 bi2o3 as explained in our recent publication 14 the pzc of the photocatalyst was characterized to be approximately at ph 3 0 therefore the photocatalyst surface charge would be negative at ph above 3 0 as recorded in table a3 the ph of effluent at day 30 was 8 03 thus the surface charge of the photocatalyst during the photodegradation was negative atrazine would be expected to be negative at ph 8 03 because its protonation decreases as the ph approach neutral due to protonation atrazine is known to be positively charged in acidic conditions 54 the pka of atrazine is 1 60 while that of tebuthiuron is 1 20 55 56 which could mean they would acquire almost similar surface charges when exposed to similar ph ranges tebuthiuron is reported to be stable in aqueous media at a ph range 5 9 56 meaning it would be negatively charged at this ph range therefore even though there was minimal photodegradation of tebuthiuron this minimal removal could be attributed to direct hole degradation and radical attack by o2 and oh radicals during the photocatalysis of atrazine and tebuthiuron effluent the percentage removal of cod remaining after biological treatment was 26 7 and 30 7 respectively table a4 it was worth noting that the removal of cod included the organic materials used in the formulation of the simulated wastewater similar results for atrazine were reported in one of our publications 14 where 24 3 was removed by 0 15hpei 0 5nacl bivo4 bi2o3 the combined removal of cod using biological and photocatalytic treatment was 82 4 and 76 6 during the treatment of atrazine and tebuthiuron respectively thus the total cod removal was substantial when using the combined system but minimal during photocatalysis alone the photonic efficiency was computed for the degradation of atrazine and tebuthiuron as the number of the pollutant molecules removed per incident photon the photon flow in the reactor was 0 0864 meinstein min 1l 1 photonic efficiency in the degradation of atrazine and tebuthiuron were 2 32 10 3 and 1 16 10 4 mol einstein 1 respectively the actinometry plot is shown in fig a10 from these results it could be observed that the heterogeneous photodegradation of atrazine was more efficient than tebuthiuron as more moles of atrazine were consumed per einstein than for tebuthiuron 4 conclusions treatment of atrazine and tebuthiuron using the activated sludge system was ineffective there was a need for further treatment using the photocatalytic reactor the compounds were perhaps toxic to the microorganisms in the activated sludge which could have led to the decreased efficiency as the days continued during the treatment this illustrated the need for an elaborate acclimatization of activated sludge to organic pollutants which requires a long time atrazine was effectively further degraded by the photocatalytic reactor but the failure to further degrade tebuthiuron demonstrated a need for more optimization of the treatment process chemical oxygen demand cod was greatly removed when using the combined treatment process thus the photocatalyst used in the photocatalytic reactor has a potential to be used in wastewater treatment even though the treatment of tebuthiuron was unsuccessful more work should be done for its optimization and could be tested using other organic pollutants other than tebuthiuron and atrazine declaration of competing interest the corresponding author confirms that

13619,the compared electro reduction of fe3 to fe2 was investigated using graphite cathode gc carbon nanotube modified graphite cathode cnt gc and acidified carbon nanotube modified cathode acnt gc acnt gc exhibited the best performance of fe3 reduction and the reduction rate of 94 7 was achieved by the electrolysis of 120 min at a cathode potential of 0 3 v vs sce which indicated the high activity of acnt towards the electro reduction of fe3 to fe2 based on the above findings two fenton processes were developed for p nitrophenol pnp degradation one fenton process was characterized by the simultaneous electro reduction of fe3 er fenton under the condition of low fe2 dosage er fenton process provided the faster pnp degradation than conventional fenton process but in er fenton process the invalid decomposition of h2o2 by anodic oxidation decreased the utilization efficiency of h2o2 for the purposes of decreasing ferrous salt dosage reducing iron sludge and enhancing the effectiveness of h2o2 another novel fenton process was developed by employing the sequencing batch electro reduction of fe3 sber fenton it was found sber fenton process presented not only the effective regeneration of fe2 but the effective h2o2 utilization due to the batch addition of h2o2 and as a result under the lower fe2 dosage condition this recommended process provided the better pnp degradation than conventional fenton process according to the concentration decays of pnp and toc the presented results confirmed that sber fenton process was able to decrease fe2 dosage for the effective fenton oxidation thus reducing the generation of iron sludge in the subsequent treatment keywords acidified carbon nanotube fe3 electro reduction sequencing batch fenton p nitrophenol degradation 1 introduction to develop the novel technologies for dealing with those toxic or bio refractory organic pollutants has long been a challenge in the field of wastewater treatment 1 3 conventional biological or physicochemical methods are inadequate for substantially removing those organic contaminants from wastewaters for this reason more and more studies have been focused on the destruction of organic pollutants in wastewaters by the various advanced oxidation processes aops including chemical photochemical and electrochemical methods 4 7 the degradation of organic pollutants by aops is mainly ascribed to the powerful oxidation of hydroxyl radical o h this radical is considered as the second strongest oxidant only after fluorine and able to non selectively react with organic pollutants generating co2 h2o and inorganic ions 4 8 among various aops fenton oxidation was first reported over one hundred years ago and its application to degrade organic pollutants began around in the late 1960s 9 in conventional fenton process hydroxyl radicals are generated by the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in the presence of fe2 in an acidic medium nowadays it has been proved to be one of the most attractive processes for the degradation of organic pollutants because of fast reaction rates mild operating conditions low toxicity and simplicity to control 4 in recent years more and more studies for wastewater treatments in chemical industry adopted fenton process 10 nevertheless this process suffers some drawbacks that limit its more wide spread application in wastewater treatment such as narrow ph range high chemicals dosage and iron sludge generation 4 11 in fenton process after the degradation of organic pollutants by fenton reactions the effluent must be finally neutralized with alkali and thus iron ions or iron complexes will precipitate as iron sludge for this process the sludge treatment and disposal is considered as one of the main drawbacks especially under the condition of high fe2 dosage therefore in recent years researchers have been focusing on how to avoid or reduce the undesirable iron sludge 12 13 one effort was to develop the heterogeneous oxidation technologies by using solid catalysts instead of soluble iron ions 14 17 unfortunately most of solid catalysts studied have presented moderate activity and some catalysts exhibited the considerable iron leaching 18 20 another effort was to explore the new fenton process characterized by the reusability of iron sludge to supply iron source for fenton reactions 21 23 however the industrial application of this process may be limited by several disadvantages such as the great acid usage amount and the adsorption of organics on iron sludge it is well known that there is a reciprocal transformation between fe2 and fe3 in fenton chain reactions 4 11 24 because the oxidation rate of fe2 is much faster than the reduction rate of fe3 the observed concentration of fe2 decreases rapidly during the degradation of organic pollutant in fenton process some researchers have made some efforts to accelerate the reduction rate of fe3 regenerating fe2 for the purpose of obtaining an effective degradation at a low initial dosage of fe2 25 27 clearly the low dosage of fe2 will reduce the amount of iron sludge for fenton process chen et al reported the strong enhancement on fenton oxidation by the addition of hydroxylamine to accelerate fe2 regeneration 11 in fact this method was controversial because of the addition of the new inorganic pollutant nh2oh now fe3 electro reduction has been mentioned widely in electro fenton process 4 28 but only a few work reported the specific performance of fe3 electro reduction by cathodes isarain chávez et al reported the electro fenton process using an air diffusion cathode for h2o2 electro generation combined with a carbon felt cathode for fe2 regeneration this study showed that the organics degradation was enhanced by fe3 electro reduction but ignored the effect of the anodic oxidation on the utilization efficiency of h2o2 25 furthermore the cathode materials used for fe3 electro reduction mainly included carbon felt graphite and graphite felt 25 29 30 however until now the ability of carbon nanotube cathode for fe3 electro reduction is still unknown and only a few studies reported carbon nanotube could be used as a reductive agent for fe3 reduction in fenton or fenton like reactions 31 32 additionally many carbon cathode modification studies were carried out to enhance oxygen reduction 33 34 or hydrogen evolution 35 36 but there were no reports on the application of modified cathodes for fe3 electro reduction in this work the cathodes were prepared by loading carbon nanotube or acidified carbon nanotube on graphite and their performance of fe3 electro reduction was examined for the first time a novel fenton process was developed in which the sequencing batch electro reduction of fe3 and the batch addition of h2o2 were adopted by the electro reduction of fe3 fe2 dosage and the iron sludge generation in fenton process are expected to decrease evidently the electro reduction and the addition of h2o2 were operated by sequencing batch mode to achieve the high utilization efficiency of h2o2 in this study pnp was selected as the simulated pollutant for evaluating the organics degradation performance of several processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals used were at analytical or chromatographic purity grade solutions were prepared using ultra pure water conductivity 0 6 μs cm 1 and h2so4 or naoh was used for ph adjustment the multi walled carbon nanotube 98 purity was purchased from nanjing xianfeng co ltd china ti sno2 sb2o5 iro2 plate anode with the same size as the cathode was prepared using thermal decomposition method 37 2 2 acidification of cnts acidified carbon nanotubes acnts were obtained by treating commercial cnts using the mixture solution of nitric acid and sulfuric acid mixed at volume ratio of 1 3 2 0 g cnts were added into 100 ml mixed acid followed by ultrasonic dispersion for 30 min after heating the mixture at 60 c for 3 h acnts were separated from the acid solution afterwards acnts were repeatedly washed by pure water as the ph value of washing water reached 7 0 acnts were dried at 100 c for 8 h in a vacuum drying oven 2 3 preparation of cathodes three graphite plates carbon content 99 each with an area of 60 cm2 5 0 cm 12 cm were polished using raw emery paper followed by a careful washing with ultra pure water after that to prepare cnt gc some cnts were loaded on one graphite plate by the grind operation while some acnts were loaded on another graphite plate to prepare acnt gc finally the two cathodes were washed with ultra pure water the third graphite plate was used as the contrast cathode gc 2 4 voltammetry experiments electrochemical measurements were conducted using a three electrode system in conjunction with a computer controlled electrochemical workstation chi760d shanghai china the three carbon cathodes including gc cnt gc and acnt gc were used as the working electrodes respectively ti sno2 sb2o5 iro2 was used as the counter electrode and saturated calomel electrode sce was used as a reference the experiments were carried out in the unstirred solution containing 1 0 mm fe2 so4 3 and 0 10 m na2so4 at ph 3 0 within a potential range of 0 4 to 0 7 v with a sweep rate of 50 mv s 1 2 5 electrochemical system and fe3 electro reduction the electrolysis experiments were performed in an open reactor at 20 1 c using the three carbon materials as the cathodes and ti sno2 sb2o5 iro2 as the anode the electrode area in contact with the electrolyte was about 50 cm2 the cathode and the anode were placed in parallel with 15 mm distance for each run 200 ml solution containing fe2 so4 3 and na2so4 ph 3 0 was poured into the reactor a continuously air flow 30 ml s 1 was fed to stir the solution by a small air pump the electrochemical workstation was used to supply the constant cathode potential during the electrolysis samples were withdrawn at desired time for the analysis of fe2 concentration 2 6 degradation of pnp three oxidation processes for pnp degradation were investigated including conventional fenton process the fenton process with fe3 electro reduction er fenton and the fenton process with the sequencing batch electro reduction of fe3 sber fenton the schemes for the three processes were shown in fig 1 for each run in conventional fenton process 200 ml of 120 mg l 1 pnp solution containing 0 10 m na2so4 ph 3 0 was poured into the reactor the solution was stirred by a small air pump feso4 was added into the solution followed by the addition of h2o2 initiating the degradation for each run in er fenton process on the basis of the above conventional fenton operations the electrolytic system described in section electrochemical system and fe3 electro reduction was adopted after the addition of h2o2 the direct current power was turned on immediately to start the electrolysis at constant voltage for sber fenton process feso4 and h2o2 were added into the solution successively initiating the degradation reactions similar to that of conventional fenton process after the degradation by fenton oxidation for 30 or 60 min the electrodes were inserted in the solution and the direct current power was turned on to start the electrolysis after 30 min the electrolysis was stopped and h2o2 was added into the solution for the second time the electrolysis and the addition of h2o2 were operated alternately if twice electrolysis operations were adopted in sber fenton process h2o2 would be added by three times the two electrodes were in contact with the solution only in the time range of the electrolysis all experiments were performed twice at least all samples drawn at desired time were immediately diluted by 5 times with water ph 10 to stop fenton reactions prior to the following chemical analysis 2 7 analytical methods sem images were obtained by jsm 6700 f scanning electron microscope jeol ltd japan the contact angles of samples were determined using yike 360a contact angle meter yike test instrument chengde china the electric conductivity was obtained by four point probe resistivity measurement system the infrared spectrums were obtained by fourier infrared spectrometer vertex70 germany ph was measured by an acidity meter phs 25c fe2 concentration was measured by the phenanthroline spectrophotometry method h2o2 concentration was measured by the spectrophotometry method using the light 410 nm absorption of the titanium hydrogen peroxide colored complex 29 the total organic carbon toc was measured using toc vcph analyzer shimadzu japan the concentration analysis of p nitrophenol was performed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry method with a gcms qp2010 ultra analyzer shimadzu japan all analyses were conducted immediately after sampling the detailed sample preparation and measurement conditions for p nitrophenol analysis were provided in supplementary material text s1 the chromatograph peak of 4 nitrophenol located at 16 430 min of retention time fig s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 materials characterization and fe3 electro reduction the sem images of gc cnt gc acnt gc and the fracture surface of acnt gc were shown in fig 2 many macro pores could be observed on the surface of gc fig 2a and the macro pores on cnt gc and acnt gc surface were loaded with carbon nanotubes fig 2b and fig 2c except for the clarity of images there was no evident difference between fig 2b and fig 2c because the acidification did not change the morphology of cnts fig s2 fig 2d revealed that some acidified carbon nanotubes were able to be embedded into the interior of graphite therefore the loaded carbon nanotubes were not just absorbed on the graphite surface but were filled in the macro pores or embedded into the graphite interior which ensured the high adhesion between carbon nanotubes and graphite the infrared spectrums of graphite cnt and acnt were compared in fig 3 the absorption peak at 3435 cm 1 was ascribed to the vibration of oh bond 38 the two absorption peaks at 2920 and 2850 cm 1 were ascribed to the vibration of ch3 and ch2 respectively 39 the two absorption peaks at 1630 and 1400 cm 1 ascribed to the vibration of cooh 40 41 it was obvious that all the three materials presented some oxygen containing functional groups oh and cooh furthermore compared with cnt acnt exhibited the greater absorption peaks at 3435 1630 and 1400 cm 1 indicated acnt presented relatively more oxygen containing functional groups confirming the successful acidification of cnt additionally the acidification led to the decrease in the quantity of ch3 and ch2 the graphite cnt and acnt powders were respectively compressed into thin slices about 2 mm under the same condition for the measurement of water contact angles according to fig 4 the graphite slice surface presented a contact angle of 58 9 while the cnt slice surface could be easily infiltrated by water which indicated that cnt surface exhibited the stronger hydrophilicity however acnt not only could be infiltrated by water but exhibited a high swelling capacity indicating the strongest hydrophilicity after the acidification the increase of oxygen containing functional groups enhanced evidently the hydrophilicity of cnt the cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed using gc cnt gc and acnt gc electrodes in na2so4 solution or in the mixed solution containing na2so4 and fe2 so4 3 at ph 3 0 the three cyclic voltammetry curves presented as dotted lines were obtained in the absence of fe3 while those presented as solid lines were obtained in the presence of fe3 fig 5 a it was evident that all the three cathodes exhibited the current peak at the potential range of about 0 1 0 5 v sce by the negative scanning in the presence of fe3 and in fact these peaks were ascribed to the electro reduction of fe3 to fe2 by the reaction in eq 1 fig s3 showed the influence of cathode potential on the electro reduction of fe3 to fe2 and all the three cathodes presented the best cathode potential of about 0 3 v for fe3 electro reduction in fig 5a the difference value of reduction current at 0 3 v was ascribed to the electro reduction of fe3 gc cnt gc and acnt gc cathodes presented the current difference values of 0 71 1 16 and 1 55 ma respectively which implied the capacity order of fe3 electro reduction was acnt gc cnt gc gc 1 fe3 e fe2 on the cathode additionally the current intensity obtained with cnt gc or acnt gc was much greater than that obtained with gc almost at all potential values which exhibited not only the electro catalytic activity of carbon nanotubes 42 but its high electric conductivity 43 the electric conductivity values of gc cnt gc and acnt gc used in this work were 9 0 104 1 2 105 1 1 105 s m 1 respectively the results of fe2 electro generating by the electro reduction of fe3 45 mg l 1 at various cathode potentials using the three cathodes were provided in fig s3 the results indicated that the cathode potential greatly affected fe3 electro reduction and the three cathodes presented the fastest fe3 electro reduction at 0 3 v the reduction results obtained at the optimum cathode potential 0 3 v were also provided in fig 5b and the corresponding pseudo first order reaction rates of fe3 electro reduction were summarized in fig 5b insert it was found that gc cnt gc and acnt gc produced 32 0 38 2 and 42 6 mg l 1 fe2 respectively by the electro reduction of 120 min and the corresponding pseudo first order reaction rates were 0 01085 0 01624 and 0 02522 min 1 respectively therefore the electro reduction of fe3 was enhanced by loading cnt on gc indicating the catalytic activity of cnt while loading acnt could enhance fe3 reduction further and hence acnt exhibited the stronger catalytic activity than cnt after acidification the surface of acnt possessed more oh and cooh groups the presence of abundant oh groups could play an important role in fe3 electro reduction 44 on the other hand the dissociation of oh and cooh groups could endow acnt with negative electricity which might increase the adsorption of fe3 on the surface of acnt to enhance fe3 electro reduction in addition an ideal performance durability of acnt gc was also confirmed by the experiments presented in fig s4 in the following experiments acnt gc at 0 3 v was applied for fe3 electro reduction the influence of initial fe3 concentration on the electro reduction and the corresponding pseudo first order reaction rates of fe3 electro reduction were provided in fig 5c although the accumulation of fe2 concentration increased with the increase of initial fe3 concentration the fastest pseudo first order reaction rate of 0 02522 min 1 was obtained with the initial concentration of 45 mg l 1 fe3 the rate did not accelerate as the initial concentration increased to 90 mg l 1 and conversely it evidently decreased to 0 01189 min 1 which might be related to the limit of electron transfer rate at the cathode as well as the oxidation of fe2 at anode the current efficiency ce and the energy consumption ec for fe3 electro reduction were the two important factors in view of industrial application fig 5d showed the values of ce and ec obtained from the electro reduction of 45 mg l 1 fe3 by acnt gc it could be observed that the ce of over 90 and the specific energy consumption of about 0 36 kw h kg fe2 1 were achieved in the reaction time of 120 min the electro reduction of fe3 to fe2 by acnt gc with the high ce and the low ec suggested a greater prospect for its application in fenton process 3 2 compared degradation by conventional fenton and er fenton processes the final aim of this study was to reduce fe2 dosage by introducing the electro reduction of fe3 into fenton process firstly the compared degradation of 120 mg l 1 pnp solution by conventional fenton and er fenton processes was carried out using 100 mg l 1 h2o2 at ph 3 0 with the various fe2 dosages to learn the effect of the electrolysis on the degradation fig 6 a showed the decay speed of pnp concentration evidently increased by the increasing of fe2 dosage and the main destruction of pnp was almost completed in 30 min with 33 0 mg l 1 fe2 the higher initial concentration of fe2 brought a large number of hydroxyl radicals by the reaction between h2o2 and fe2 eq 2 in a short time and as a result pnp molecules were destructed quickly 4 45 2 h2o2 fe2 h oh fe3 h2o the decay of pnp concentration by the er fenton process was shown in fig 6b for the degradation in the first 30 min the increasing of fe2 dosage enhanced the decay speed of pnp similar as conventional fenton process however after 60 min the best degradation results were achieved with 16 5 mg l 1 instead of 33 0 mg l 1 this repeatable result indicated that the optimum dosage of fe2 was 16 5 mg l 1 at 100 mg l 1 h2o2 dosage by comparing fig 6a and fig 6b it was found that er fenton process presented the faster decay of pnp than conventional fenton process with the same fe2 dosage 4 1 8 3 and 16 5 mg l 1 which indicated that the electro reduction of fe3 was able to accelerate the degradation under the condition of low dosage fe2 this conclusion has been strengthened by the degradation results obtained with fe3 as the catalyst fig s5 additionally the degradation performance obtained by er fenton process with 16 5 mg l 1 fe2 was approximate to that obtained by conventional fenton process with 33 0 mg l 1 fe2 under fe2 dosages of 4 1 8 3 16 5 and 33 0 mg l 1 after the treatment of 120 min the residual h2o2 concentration values were 57 1 34 6 15 3 and 7 2 mg l 1 respectively in conventional fenton process while they were 48 0 12 9 4 6 and 0 5 mg l 1 respectively in er fenton process clearly er fenton process exhibited a faster h2o2 consumption than conventional fenton process under the same fe2 dosage which was caused by the electro reduction of fe3 to fe2 and the anodic oxidation of h2o2 apart from fe2 dosage the degradation performance by the processes based on fenton reactions is closely related to the utilization efficiency of h2o2 46 in conventional fenton process this efficiency depends on the complicated reactions between h2o2 fe2 fe3 and many radicals 4 8 however when the electrochemical system was employed in fenton process its effect on the utilization efficiency of h2o2 should be focused 47 firstly the decomposition of h2o2 caused by the electrolysis procedure was checked and the results were shown in fig s6 due to the anodic oxidation and the catalytic function of anode material itself the electrolysis procedure caused the obvious decomposition of h2o2 and the decomposition accelerated as the electrolysis voltage increased 47 the decomposition rate of about 15 was obtained by the electrolysis of 120 min at the voltage of 0 8 v cathode potential of 0 3 v the pnp decay of obtained by conventional fenton process and er fenton process with 16 5 mg l 1 fe2 was shown in fig 7 er fenton process presented a faster degradation in 60 min but the degradation performance after 150 min was slightly surpassed by conventional fenton process which exhibited a high repeatability because the anodic oxidation decomposition of h2o2 could not bring the organics degradation 47 and the above result was explained by this decomposition reducing the utilization efficiency of h2o2 in er fenton process in addition the electrolysis at 0 3 v cathode potential only brought a slight decay of pnp in 120 min fig s7 which indicated the anodic oxidation destruction of pnp 48 could be ignored in er fenton process and the following sber fenton process 3 3 degradation of pnp by sber fenton process as discussed previously although h2o2 can be quickly consumed in the presence of fe2 the anodic decomposition of h2o2 49 should not be ignored when the electrochemical system was introduced into fenton process to avoid the adverse effect caused by the anodic oxidation of h2o2 on the organics degradation sber fenton process was developed in this process the sequencing batch electro reduction of fe3 and the batch addition of h2o2 were adopted the degradation of pnp by several processes with the total h2o2 dosage of 100 mg l 1 was conducted to prove the effectiveness of sber fenton process according to fig 8 a under the condition of 16 5 mg l 1 fe2 the concentration of pnp decreased to 20 8 mg l 1 by the degradation of 180 min using conventional fenton process with the addition of 100 mg l 1 h2o2 by once while it could decrease to 16 2 mg l 1 with the addition of h2o2 by twice 50 mg l 1 for each time this result indicated the utilization efficiency of h2o2 was enhanced by the addition of h2o2 by twice leading to a better degradation sber fenton process presented the lowest residual concentration of 12 5 mg l 1 exhibiting its greater degradation performance than the other two processes comparing the degradation obtained by sber fenton process with 16 5 mg l 1 fe2 fig 8a and conventional fenton process with 33 0 mg l 1 fe2 the former was unable to complete the degradation in a shorter time like the latter but its main advantages were represented by the low fe2 dosage and the better degradation fig 8b showed the decay of pnp obtained by sber fenton process with the electro reduction of fe3 by twice and the addition of h2o2 by three times in this case the main degradation of pnp occurred in 0 30 60 90 and 120 150 min by fenton oxidation and the final residual concentration was 6 2 mg l 1 much lower than that obtained by conventional fenton process 20 mg l 1 in the above sber fenton process the electro reduction of fe3 was only enabled in 60 90 min fig 8a or 30 60 min and 90 120 min fig 8b rather than in all the treatment time the bulk of h2o2 was consumed in fenton reactions prior to enabling the electrolysis the main organics degradation by fenton oxidation and the electro reduction of fe3 to fe2 were enabled alternatively to avoid the anodic oxidation decomposition of h2o2 in summary the electro reduction of fe3 and the addition of h2o2 were operated by the sequencing batch mode not only decreasing the demand of fe2 dosage but enhancing the utilization efficiency of h2o2 for fenton process toc concentration decay represented the level of organics mineralization by which the further degradation performance was evaluated the high organics mineralization demanded a high h2o2 dosage thus the addition of 400 mg l 1 h2o2 by once was applied in conventional fenton process while 200 100 and 100 mg l 1 h2o2 were added at 0 60 and 120 min respectively in sber fenton process the electro reduction of fe3 was enabled in 30 60 and 90 120 min in sber fenton process the residual toc concentration values at the end of treatment 150 min obtained with various fe2 dosages were shown in fig 9 a first of all sber fenton process presented the higher toc removal than conventional fenton process under various fe2 dosages exhibiting its advantage on organics degradation secondly for sber fenton process the lowest residual toc concentration of 31 5 mg l 1 was achieved with 22 0 mg l 1 fe2 while it 36 0 mg l 1 was obtained with 33 0 mg l 1 fe2 for conventional fenton process in conclusion sber fenton process has provided the better degradation with a lower fe2 dosage than conventional fenton process this conclusion was also obtained by the contrast degradation using 600 mg l 1 h2o2 with various fe2 dosages table s1 the products of pnp degradation included co2 h2o organic byproducts and inorganic ions and the residual toc at the end of treatment represented the various organic byproducts from pnp degradation 45 50 51 and the higher toc removal demanded a higher fenton reagent dosage in this work the two main intermediate byproducts p benzoquinone at 5 155 min retention time and p benzenediol at 11 736 min were found at 15 min fig s8 they disappeared at 90 min indicating their further oxidation to other substances fig s8 fig 9b showed the variations of toc obtained from sber fenton process with 22 0 mg l 1 fe2 and conventional fenton process with 33 0 mg l 1 fe2 obviously conventional fenton process presented the faster toc decay in 15 min followed by a very slow decay sber fenton process presented the step like toc decay and the decay mainly occurred in 0 30 60 90 and 120 150 min ascribed to fenton oxidation the concentration variations of fe2 and h2o2 in the degradation of pnp by conventional fenton and sber fenton processes were shown in fig 9c and d respectively the fe2 concentration in conventional fenton process quickly decreased to about 8 mg l 1 from the initial 33 0 mg l 1 in 30 min and remained at the low concentration level in 30 150 min the fe2 concentration in sber fenton process decreased to about 7 mg l 1 in 0 30 60 90 and 120 150 min ascribed to fenton reactions by the addition of h2o2 but it increased to about 15 mg l 1 in 30 60 and 90 120 min ascribed to the electro reduction of fe3 regenerating fe2 according to fig 8d the h2o2 concentration in the conventional fenton continuously decreased to 3 5 mg l 1 in 150 min for sber fenton process h2o2 was at a low concentration level in 30 60 and 90 120 min which successfully avoided the undesired decomposition of h2o2 by the anodic oxidation after the treatment of 150 min the added h2o2 was almost consumed completely both in conventional fenton process and sber fenton process the ph value during the degradation in the sber fenton process decreased to 2 7 from the original value of 3 0 fig s9 and this ph variation range could prevent the hydrolysis of iron ions the decrease of ph value was mainly ascribed to the generation of some organic acids during the degradation of pnp based on the above findings two sber fenton processes were recommended for the industrial application just as the experimental process in this work the first one was shown in fig 10 a in which fenton oxidation reactions and the electro reduction of fe3 occurred alternatively in the same reactor the discontinuous running in this process is applicable for the small scale treatment engineering the second sber fenton process was shown in fig 10b in this continuous running process two stage fenton oxidation degradation and one stage electro reduction of fe3 occurred in different reactors undoubtedly this process also can adopt three stage fenton oxidation and two stage electro reduction although the electro reduction of fe3 used for the cyclic utilization of iron sludge in fenton process has been reported 52 the novel sber fenton process was presented for the first time and expected to degrade organic pollutants with a low dosage of fe2 and a low iron sludge yield 4 conclusion compared with graphite cathode the modification with cnt enhanced the electro reduction of fe3 to fe2 while the modification with acnt further enhanced the reduction activity therefore acnt gc exhibited the best performance of fe3 electro reduction generating fe2 and it was able to provide a reduction rate of 94 7 by the electrolysis of 120 min at the optimum cathode potential 0 3 v on the basis of fe3 electro reduction er fenton and sber fenton processes were developed for pnp degradation in er fenton process the electrochemical reactions accompanied fenton reactions all the time which decreased the utilization efficiency of h2o2 due to the anodic oxidation of h2o2 to decrease ferrous salt dosage reduce iron sludge amount and enhance the utilization efficiency of h2o2 in fenton process sber fenton process was developed by adopting the sequencing batch electro reduction of fe3 and the batch addition of h2o2 in this process the batch addition of h2o2 and the batch electro reduction of fe3 were performed alternately to avoid the anodic oxidation of h2o2 compared with conventional fenton and er fenton processes sber fenton process presented the better pnp degradation at a lower fe2 dosage the decrease of fe2 dosage for fenton reactions will reduce the yield of iron sludge in the subsequent treatment it can be concluded the electro reduction of fe3 to fe2 by acnt gc with the low ec provided a greater prospect for its application in fenton process and the recommended sber fenton process may be a promising alternative for the treatment of those organic wastewaters declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgment this work was supported by the natural science foundation of shandong province

effectiveness of h2o2 another novel fenton process was developed by employing the sequencing batch electro reduction of fe3 sber fenton it was found sber fenton process presented not only the effective regeneration of fe2 but the effective h2o2 utilization due to the batch addition of h2o2 and as a result under the lower fe2 dosage condition this recommended process provided the better pnp degradation than conventional fenton process according to the concentration decays of pnp and toc the presented results confirmed that sber fenton process was able to decrease fe2 dosage for the effective fenton oxidation thus reducing the generation of iron sludge in the subsequent treatment keywords acidified carbon nanotube fe3 electro reduction sequencing batch fenton p nitrophenol degradation 1 introduction to develop the novel technologies for dealing with those toxic or bio refractory organic pollutants has long been a challenge in the field of wastewater treatment 1 3 conventional biological or physicochemical methods are inadequate for substantially removing those organic contaminants from wastewaters for this reason more and more studies have been focused on the destruction of organic pollutants in wastewaters by the various advanced oxidation processes aops including chemical photochemical and electrochemical methods 4 7 the degradation of organic pollutants by aops is mainly ascribed to the powerful oxidation of hydroxyl radical o h this radical is considered as the second strongest oxidant only after fluorine and able to non selectively react with organic pollutants generating co2 h2o and inorganic ions 4 8 among various aops fenton oxidation was first reported over one hundred years ago and its application to degrade organic pollutants began around in the late 1960s 9 in conventional fenton process hydroxyl radicals are generated by the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in the presence of fe2 in an acidic medium nowadays it has been proved to be one of the most attractive processes for the degradation of organic pollutants because of fast reaction rates mild operating conditions low toxicity and simplicity to control 4 in recent years more and more studies for wastewater treatments in chemical industry adopted fenton process 10 nevertheless this process suffers some drawbacks that limit its more wide spread application in wastewater treatment such as narrow ph range high chemicals dosage and iron sludge generation 4 11 in fenton process after the degradation of organic pollutants by fenton reactions the effluent must be finally neutralized with alkali and thus iron ions or iron complexes will precipitate as iron sludge for this process the sludge treatment and disposal is considered as one of the main drawbacks especially under the condition of high fe2 dosage therefore in recent years researchers have been focusing on how to avoid or reduce the undesirable iron sludge 12 13 one effort was to develop the heterogeneous oxidation technologies by using solid catalysts instead of soluble iron ions 14 17 unfortunately most of solid catalysts studied have presented moderate activity and some catalysts exhibited the considerable iron leaching 18 20 another effort was to explore the new fenton process characterized by the reusability of iron sludge to supply iron source for fenton reactions 21 23 however the industrial application of this process may be limited by several disadvantages such as the great acid usage amount and the adsorption of organics on iron sludge it is well known that there is a reciprocal transformation between fe2 and fe3 in fenton chain reactions 4 11 24 because the oxidation rate of fe2 is much faster than the reduction rate of fe3 the observed concentration of fe2 decreases rapidly during the degradation of organic pollutant in fenton process some researchers have made some efforts to accelerate the reduction rate of fe3 regenerating fe2 for the purpose of obtaining an effective degradation at a low initial dosage of fe2 25 27 clearly the low dosage of fe2 will reduce the amount of iron sludge for fenton process chen et al reported the strong enhancement on fenton oxidation by the addition of hydroxylamine to accelerate fe2 regeneration 11 in fact this method was controversial because of the addition of the new inorganic pollutant nh2oh now fe3 electro reduction has been mentioned widely in electro fenton process 4 28 but only a few work reported the specific performance of fe3 electro reduction by cathodes isarain chávez et al reported the electro fenton process using an air diffusion cathode for h2o2 electro generation combined with a carbon felt cathode for fe2 regeneration this study showed that the organics degradation was enhanced by fe3 electro reduction but ignored the effect of the anodic oxidation on the utilization efficiency of h2o2 25 furthermore the cathode materials used for fe3 electro reduction mainly included carbon felt graphite and graphite felt 25 29 30 however until now the ability of carbon nanotube cathode for fe3 electro reduction is still unknown and only a few studies reported carbon nanotube could be used as a reductive agent for fe3 reduction in fenton or fenton like reactions 31 32 additionally many carbon cathode modification studies were carried out to enhance oxygen reduction 33 34 or hydrogen evolution 35 36 but there were no reports on the application of modified cathodes for fe3 electro reduction in this work the cathodes were prepared by loading carbon nanotube or acidified carbon nanotube on graphite and their performance of fe3 electro reduction was examined for the first time a novel fenton process was developed in which the sequencing batch electro reduction of fe3 and the batch addition of h2o2 were adopted by the electro reduction of fe3 fe2 dosage and the iron sludge generation in fenton process are expected to decrease evidently the electro reduction and the addition of h2o2 were operated by sequencing batch mode to achieve the high utilization efficiency of h2o2 in this study pnp was selected as the simulated pollutant for evaluating the organics degradation performance of several processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals used were at analytical or chromatographic purity grade solutions were prepared using ultra pure water conductivity 0 6 μs cm 1 and h2so4 or naoh was used for ph adjustment the multi walled carbon nanotube 98 purity was purchased from nanjing xianfeng co ltd china ti sno2 sb2o5 iro2 plate anode with the same size as the cathode was prepared using thermal decomposition method 37 2 2 acidification of cnts acidified carbon nanotubes acnts were obtained by treating commercial cnts using the mixture solution of nitric acid and sulfuric acid mixed at volume ratio of 1 3 2 0 g cnts were added into 100 ml mixed acid followed by ultrasonic dispersion for 30 min after heating the mixture at 60 c for 3 h acnts were separated from the acid solution afterwards acnts were repeatedly washed by pure water as the ph value of washing water reached 7 0 acnts were dried at 100 c for 8 h in a vacuum drying oven 2 3 preparation of cathodes three graphite plates carbon content 99 each with an area of 60 cm2 5 0 cm 12 cm were polished using raw emery paper followed by a careful washing with ultra pure water after that to prepare cnt gc some cnts were loaded on one graphite plate by the grind operation while some acnts were loaded on another graphite plate to prepare acnt gc finally the two cathodes were washed with ultra pure water the third graphite plate was used as the contrast cathode gc 2 4 voltammetry experiments electrochemical measurements were conducted using a three electrode system in conjunction with a computer controlled electrochemical workstation chi760d shanghai china the three carbon cathodes including gc cnt gc and acnt gc were used as the working electrodes respectively ti sno2 sb2o5 iro2 was used as the counter electrode and saturated calomel electrode sce was used as a reference the experiments were carried out in the unstirred solution containing 1 0 mm fe2 so4 3 and 0 10 m na2so4 at ph 3 0 within a potential range of 0 4 to 0 7 v with a sweep rate of 50 mv s 1 2 5 electrochemical system and fe3 electro reduction the electrolysis experiments were performed in an open reactor at 20 1 c using the three carbon materials as the cathodes and ti sno2 sb2o5 iro2 as the anode the electrode area in contact with the electrolyte was about 50 cm2 the cathode and the anode were placed in parallel with 15 mm distance for each run 200 ml solution containing fe2 so4 3 and na2so4 ph 3 0 was poured into the reactor a continuously air flow 30 ml s 1 was fed to stir the solution by a small air pump the electrochemical workstation was used to supply the constant cathode potential during the electrolysis samples were withdrawn at desired time for the analysis of fe2 concentration 2 6 degradation of pnp three oxidation processes for pnp degradation were investigated including conventional fenton process the fenton process with fe3 electro reduction er fenton and the fenton process with the sequencing batch electro reduction of fe3 sber fenton the schemes for the three processes were shown in fig 1 for each run in conventional fenton process 200 ml of 120 mg l 1 pnp solution containing 0 10 m na2so4 ph 3 0 was poured into the reactor the solution was stirred by a small air pump feso4 was added into the solution followed by the addition of h2o2 initiating the degradation for each run in er fenton process on the basis of the above conventional fenton operations the electrolytic system described in section electrochemical system and fe3 electro reduction was adopted after the addition of h2o2 the direct current power was turned on immediately to start the electrolysis at constant voltage for sber fenton process feso4 and h2o2 were added into the solution successively initiating the degradation reactions similar to that of conventional fenton process after the degradation by fenton oxidation for 30 or 60 min the electrodes were inserted in the solution and the direct current power was turned on to start the electrolysis after 30 min the electrolysis was stopped and h2o2 was added into the solution for the second time the electrolysis and the addition of h2o2 were operated alternately if twice electrolysis operations were adopted in sber fenton process h2o2 would be added by three times the two electrodes were in contact with the solution only in the time range of the electrolysis all experiments were performed twice at least all samples drawn at desired time were immediately diluted by 5 times with water ph 10 to stop fenton reactions prior to the following chemical analysis 2 7 analytical methods sem images were obtained by jsm 6700 f scanning electron microscope jeol ltd japan the contact angles of samples were determined using yike 360a contact angle meter yike test instrument chengde china the electric conductivity was obtained by four point probe resistivity measurement system the infrared spectrums were obtained by fourier infrared spectrometer vertex70 germany ph was measured by an acidity meter phs 25c fe2 concentration was measured by the phenanthroline spectrophotometry method h2o2 concentration was measured by the spectrophotometry method using the light 410 nm absorption of the titanium hydrogen peroxide colored complex 29 the total organic carbon toc was measured using toc vcph analyzer shimadzu japan the concentration analysis of p nitrophenol was performed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry method with a gcms qp2010 ultra analyzer shimadzu japan all analyses were conducted immediately after sampling the detailed sample preparation and measurement conditions for p nitrophenol analysis were provided in supplementary material text s1 the chromatograph peak of 4 nitrophenol located at 16 430 min of retention time fig s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 materials characterization and fe3 electro reduction the sem images of gc cnt gc acnt gc and the fracture surface of acnt gc were shown in fig 2 many macro pores could be observed on the surface of gc fig 2a and the macro pores on cnt gc and acnt gc surface were loaded with carbon nanotubes fig 2b and fig 2c except for the clarity of images there was no evident difference between fig 2b and fig 2c because the acidification did not change the morphology of cnts fig s2 fig 2d revealed that some acidified carbon nanotubes were able to be embedded into the interior of graphite therefore the loaded carbon nanotubes were not just absorbed on the graphite surface but were filled in the macro pores or embedded into the graphite interior which ensured the high adhesion between carbon nanotubes and graphite the infrared spectrums of graphite cnt and acnt were compared in fig 3 the absorption peak at 3435 cm 1 was ascribed to the vibration of oh bond 38 the two absorption peaks at 2920 and 2850 cm 1 were ascribed to the vibration of ch3 and ch2 respectively 39 the two absorption peaks at 1630 and 1400 cm 1 ascribed to the vibration of cooh 40 41 it was obvious that all the three materials presented some oxygen containing functional groups oh and cooh furthermore compared with cnt acnt exhibited the greater absorption peaks at 3435 1630 and 1400 cm 1 indicated acnt presented relatively more oxygen containing functional groups confirming the successful acidification of cnt additionally the acidification led to the decrease in the quantity of ch3 and ch2 the graphite cnt and acnt powders were respectively compressed into thin slices about 2 mm under the same condition for the measurement of water contact angles according to fig 4 the graphite slice surface presented a contact angle of 58 9 while the cnt slice surface could be easily infiltrated by water which indicated that cnt surface exhibited the stronger hydrophilicity however acnt not only could be infiltrated by water but exhibited a high swelling capacity indicating the strongest hydrophilicity after the acidification the increase of oxygen containing functional groups enhanced evidently the hydrophilicity of cnt the cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed using gc cnt gc and acnt gc electrodes in na2so4 solution or in the mixed solution containing na2so4 and fe2 so4 3 at ph 3 0 the three cyclic voltammetry curves presented as dotted lines were obtained in the absence of fe3 while those presented as solid lines were obtained in the presence of fe3 fig 5 a it was evident that all the three cathodes exhibited the current peak at the potential range of about 0 1 0 5 v sce by the negative scanning in the presence of fe3 and in fact these peaks were ascribed to the electro reduction of fe3 to fe2 by the reaction in eq 1 fig s3 showed the influence of cathode potential on the electro reduction of fe3 to fe2 and all the three cathodes presented the best cathode potential of about 0 3 v for fe3 electro reduction in fig 5a the difference value of reduction current at 0 3 v was ascribed to the electro reduction of fe3 gc cnt gc and acnt gc cathodes presented the current difference values of 0 71 1 16 and 1 55 ma respectively which implied the capacity order of fe3 electro reduction was acnt gc cnt gc gc 1 fe3 e fe2 on the cathode additionally the current intensity obtained with cnt gc or acnt gc was much greater than that obtained with gc almost at all potential values which exhibited not only the electro catalytic activity of carbon nanotubes 42 but its high electric conductivity 43 the electric conductivity values of gc cnt gc and acnt gc used in this work were 9 0 104 1 2 105 1 1 105 s m 1 respectively the results of fe2 electro generating by the electro reduction of fe3 45 mg l 1 at various cathode potentials using the three cathodes were provided in fig s3 the results indicated that the cathode potential greatly affected fe3 electro reduction and the three cathodes presented the fastest fe3 electro reduction at 0 3 v the reduction results obtained at the optimum cathode potential 0 3 v were also provided in fig 5b and the corresponding pseudo first order reaction rates of fe3 electro reduction were summarized in fig 5b insert it was found that gc cnt gc and acnt gc produced 32 0 38 2 and 42 6 mg l 1 fe2 respectively by the electro reduction of 120 min and the corresponding pseudo first order reaction rates were 0 01085 0 01624 and 0 02522 min 1 respectively therefore the electro reduction of fe3 was enhanced by loading cnt on gc indicating the catalytic activity of cnt while loading acnt could enhance fe3 reduction further and hence acnt exhibited the stronger catalytic activity than cnt after acidification the surface of acnt possessed more oh and cooh groups the presence of abundant oh groups could play an important role in fe3 electro reduction 44 on the other hand the dissociation of oh and cooh groups could endow acnt with negative electricity which might increase the adsorption of fe3 on the surface of acnt to enhance fe3 electro reduction in addition an ideal performance durability of acnt gc was also confirmed by the experiments presented in fig s4 in the following experiments acnt gc at 0 3 v was applied for fe3 electro reduction the influence of initial fe3 concentration on the electro reduction and the corresponding pseudo first order reaction rates of fe3 electro reduction were provided in fig 5c although the accumulation of fe2 concentration increased with the increase of initial fe3 concentration the fastest pseudo first order reaction rate of 0 02522 min 1 was obtained with the initial concentration of 45 mg l 1 fe3 the rate did not accelerate as the initial concentration increased to 90 mg l 1 and conversely it evidently decreased to 0 01189 min 1 which might be related to the limit of electron transfer rate at the cathode as well as the oxidation of fe2 at anode the current efficiency ce and the energy consumption ec for fe3 electro reduction were the two important factors in view of industrial application fig 5d showed the values of ce and ec obtained from the electro reduction of 45 mg l 1 fe3 by acnt gc it could be observed that the ce of over 90 and the specific energy consumption of about 0 36 kw h kg fe2 1 were achieved in the reaction time of 120 min the electro reduction of fe3 to fe2 by acnt gc with the high ce and the low ec suggested a greater prospect for its application in fenton process 3 2 compared degradation by conventional fenton and er fenton processes the final aim of this study was to reduce fe2 dosage by introducing the electro reduction of fe3 into fenton process firstly the compared degradation of 120 mg l 1 pnp solution by conventional fenton and er fenton processes was carried out using 100 mg l 1 h2o2 at ph 3 0 with the various fe2 dosages to learn the effect of the electrolysis on the degradation fig 6 a showed the decay speed of pnp concentration evidently increased by the increasing of fe2 dosage and the main destruction of pnp was almost completed in 30 min with 33 0 mg l 1 fe2 the higher initial concentration of fe2 brought a large number of hydroxyl radicals by the reaction between h2o2 and fe2 eq 2 in a short time and as a result pnp molecules were destructed quickly 4 45 2 h2o2 fe2 h oh fe3 h2o the decay of pnp concentration by the er fenton process was shown in fig 6b for the degradation in the first 30 min the increasing of fe2 dosage enhanced the decay speed of pnp similar as conventional fenton process however after 60 min the best degradation results were achieved with 16 5 mg l 1 instead of 33 0 mg l 1 this repeatable result indicated that the optimum dosage of fe2 was 16 5 mg l 1 at 100 mg l 1 h2o2 dosage by comparing fig 6a and fig 6b it was found that er fenton process presented the faster decay of pnp than conventional fenton process with the same fe2 dosage 4 1 8 3 and 16 5 mg l 1 which indicated that the electro reduction of fe3 was able to accelerate the degradation under the condition of low dosage fe2 this conclusion has been strengthened by the degradation results obtained with fe3 as the catalyst fig s5 additionally the degradation performance obtained by er fenton process with 16 5 mg l 1 fe2 was approximate to that obtained by conventional fenton process with 33 0 mg l 1 fe2 under fe2 dosages of 4 1 8 3 16 5 and 33 0 mg l 1 after the treatment of 120 min the residual h2o2 concentration values were 57 1 34 6 15 3 and 7 2 mg l 1 respectively in conventional fenton process while they were 48 0 12 9 4 6 and 0 5 mg l 1 respectively in er fenton process clearly er fenton process exhibited a faster h2o2 consumption than conventional fenton process under the same fe2 dosage which was caused by the electro reduction of fe3 to fe2 and the anodic oxidation of h2o2 apart from fe2 dosage the degradation performance by the processes based on fenton reactions is closely related to the utilization efficiency of h2o2 46 in conventional fenton process this efficiency depends on the complicated reactions between h2o2 fe2 fe3 and many radicals 4 8 however when the electrochemical system was employed in fenton process its effect on the utilization efficiency of h2o2 should be focused 47 firstly the decomposition of h2o2 caused by the electrolysis procedure was checked and the results were shown in fig s6 due to the anodic oxidation and the catalytic function of anode material itself the electrolysis procedure caused the obvious decomposition of h2o2 and the decomposition accelerated as the electrolysis voltage increased 47 the decomposition rate of about 15 was obtained by the electrolysis of 120 min at the voltage of 0 8 v cathode potential of 0 3 v the pnp decay of obtained by conventional fenton process and er fenton process with 16 5 mg l 1 fe2 was shown in fig 7 er fenton process presented a faster degradation in 60 min but the degradation performance after 150 min was slightly surpassed by conventional fenton process which exhibited a high repeatability because the anodic oxidation decomposition of h2o2 could not bring the organics degradation 47 and the above result was explained by this decomposition reducing the utilization efficiency of h2o2 in er fenton process in addition the electrolysis at 0 3 v cathode potential only brought a slight decay of pnp in 120 min fig s7 which indicated the anodic oxidation destruction of pnp 48 could be ignored in er fenton process and the following sber fenton process 3 3 degradation of pnp by sber fenton process as discussed previously although h2o2 can be quickly consumed in the presence of fe2 the anodic decomposition of h2o2 49 should not be ignored when the electrochemical system was introduced into fenton process to avoid the adverse effect caused by the anodic oxidation of h2o2 on the organics degradation sber fenton process was developed in this process the sequencing batch electro reduction of fe3 and the batch addition of h2o2 were adopted the degradation of pnp by several processes with the total h2o2 dosage of 100 mg l 1 was conducted to prove the effectiveness of sber fenton process according to fig 8 a under the condition of 16 5 mg l 1 fe2 the concentration of pnp decreased to 20 8 mg l 1 by the degradation of 180 min using conventional fenton process with the addition of 100 mg l 1 h2o2 by once while it could decrease to 16 2 mg l 1 with the addition of h2o2 by twice 50 mg l 1 for each time this result indicated the utilization efficiency of h2o2 was enhanced by the addition of h2o2 by twice leading to a better degradation sber fenton process presented the lowest residual concentration of 12 5 mg l 1 exhibiting its greater degradation performance than the other two processes comparing the degradation obtained by sber fenton process with 16 5 mg l 1 fe2 fig 8a and conventional fenton process with 33 0 mg l 1 fe2 the former was unable to complete the degradation in a shorter time like the latter but its main advantages were represented by the low fe2 dosage and the better degradation fig 8b showed the decay of pnp obtained by sber fenton process with the electro reduction of fe3 by twice and the addition of h2o2 by three times in this case the main degradation of pnp occurred in 0 30 60 90 and 120 150 min by fenton oxidation and the final residual concentration was 6 2 mg l 1 much lower than that obtained by conventional fenton process 20 mg l 1 in the above sber fenton process the electro reduction of fe3 was only enabled in 60 90 min fig 8a or 30 60 min and 90 120 min fig 8b rather than in all the treatment time the bulk of h2o2 was consumed in fenton reactions prior to enabling the electrolysis the main organics degradation by fenton oxidation and the electro reduction of fe3 to fe2 were enabled alternatively to avoid the anodic oxidation decomposition of h2o2 in summary the electro reduction of fe3 and the addition of h2o2 were operated by the sequencing batch mode not only decreasing the demand of fe2 dosage but enhancing the utilization efficiency of h2o2 for fenton process toc concentration decay represented the level of organics mineralization by which the further degradation performance was evaluated the high organics mineralization demanded a high h2o2 dosage thus the addition of 400 mg l 1 h2o2 by once was applied in conventional fenton process while 200 100 and 100 mg l 1 h2o2 were added at 0 60 and 120 min respectively in sber fenton process the electro reduction of fe3 was enabled in 30 60 and 90 120 min in sber fenton process the residual toc concentration values at the end of treatment 150 min obtained with various fe2 dosages were shown in fig 9 a first of all sber fenton process presented the higher toc removal than conventional fenton process under various fe2 dosages exhibiting its advantage on organics degradation secondly for sber fenton process the lowest residual toc concentration of 31 5 mg l 1 was achieved with 22 0 mg l 1 fe2 while it 36 0 mg l 1 was obtained with 33 0 mg l 1 fe2 for conventional fenton process in conclusion sber fenton process has provided the better degradation with a lower fe2 dosage than conventional fenton process this conclusion was also obtained by the contrast degradation using 600 mg l 1 h2o2 with various fe2 dosages table s1 the products of pnp degradation included co2 h2o organic byproducts and inorganic ions and the residual toc at the end of treatment represented the various organic byproducts from pnp degradation 45 50 51 and the higher toc removal demanded a higher fenton reagent dosage in this work the two main intermediate byproducts p benzoquinone at 5 155 min retention time and p benzenediol at 11 736 min were found at 15 min fig s8 they disappeared at 90 min indicating their further oxidation to other substances fig s8 fig 9b showed the variations of toc obtained from sber fenton process with 22 0 mg l 1 fe2 and conventional fenton process with 33 0 mg l 1 fe2 obviously conventional fenton process presented the faster toc decay in 15 min followed by a very slow decay sber fenton process presented the step like toc decay and the decay mainly occurred in 0 30 60 90 and 120 150 min ascribed to fenton oxidation the concentration variations of fe2 and h2o2 in the degradation of pnp by conventional fenton and sber fenton processes were shown in fig 9c and d respectively the fe2 concentration in conventional fenton process quickly decreased to about 8 mg l 1 from the initial 33 0 mg l 1 in 30 min and remained at the low concentration level in 30 150 min the fe2 concentration in sber fenton process decreased to about 7 mg l 1 in 0 30 60 90 and 120 150 min ascribed to fenton reactions by the addition of h2o2 but it increased to about 15 mg l 1 in 30 60 and 90 120 min ascribed to the electro reduction of fe3 regenerating fe2 according to fig 8d the h2o2 concentration in the conventional fenton continuously decreased to 3 5 mg l 1 in 150 min for sber fenton process h2o2 was at a low concentration level in 30 60 and 90 120 min which successfully avoided the undesired decomposition of h2o2 by the anodic oxidation after the treatment of 150 min the added h2o2 was almost consumed completely both in conventional fenton process and sber fenton process the ph value during the degradation in the sber fenton process decreased to 2 7 from the original value of 3 0 fig s9 and this ph variation range could prevent the hydrolysis of iron ions the decrease of ph value was mainly ascribed to the generation of some organic acids during the degradation of pnp based on the above findings two sber fenton processes were recommended for the industrial application just as the experimental process in this work the first one was shown in fig 10 a in which fenton oxidation reactions and the electro reduction of fe3 occurred alternatively in the same reactor the discontinuous running in this process is applicable for the small scale treatment engineering the second sber fenton process was shown in fig 10b in this continuous running process two stage fenton oxidation degradation and one stage electro reduction of fe3 occurred in different reactors undoubtedly this process also can adopt three stage fenton oxidation and two stage electro reduction although the electro reduction of fe3 used for the cyclic utilization of iron sludge in fenton process has been reported 52 the novel sber fenton process was presented for the first time and expected to degrade organic pollutants with a low dosage of fe2 and a low iron sludge yield 4 conclusion compared with graphite cathode the modification with cnt enhanced the electro reduction of fe3 to fe2 while the modification with acnt further enhanced the reduction activity therefore acnt gc exhibited the best performance of fe3 electro reduction generating fe2 and it was able to provide a reduction rate of 94 7 by the electrolysis of 120 min at the optimum cathode potential 0 3 v on the basis of fe3 electro reduction er fenton and sber fenton processes were developed for pnp degradation in er fenton process the electrochemical reactions accompanied fenton reactions all the time which decreased the utilization efficiency of h2o2 due to the anodic oxidation of h2o2 to decrease ferrous salt dosage reduce iron sludge amount and enhance the utilization efficiency of h2o2 in fenton process sber fenton process was developed by adopting the sequencing batch electro reduction of fe3 and the batch addition of h2o2 in this process the batch addition of h2o2 and the batch electro reduction of fe3 were performed alternately to avoid the anodic oxidation of h2o2 compared with conventional fenton and er fenton processes sber fenton process presented the better pnp degradation at a lower fe2 dosage the decrease of fe2 dosage for fenton reactions will reduce the yield of iron sludge in the subsequent treatment it can be concluded the electro reduction of fe3 to fe2 by acnt gc with the low ec provided a greater prospect for its application in fenton process and the recommended sber fenton process may be a promising alternative for the treatment of
