20450,plate anchors has been widely adopted to provide uplift resistance for offshore floating facilities the research on the bearing capacity of plate anchors under cyclic loads is still relatively rare compared with the monotonic loads in the present paper the bearing capacity of plate anchors under the combination of average and cyclic loads in normal consolidation clays with linearly increasing shear strength is investigated by performing finite element analysis a more reasonable expression is proposed to determine the cyclic loading factor u c y by modifying the formula suggested by det norske veritas a global cyclic loading factor u c y is defined to determine the cyclic anchor resistance considering the difference of average stress level for each soil element around the anchor the method to determine u c y by finite element analysis is suggested and then the u c y for any given normalized average loads and the equivalent number of cycles is determined the effects of the embedment depth and inclination angles on u c y are also investigated by performing a series of numerical simulations an expression of u c y associated with normalized average loads and the equivalent number of cycles are proposed based on numerical results which can provide some reference for the engineering design of plate anchors under cyclic loads keywords plate anchors clays bearing capacity cyclic loads offshore geotechnics finite element analysis 1 introduction oil and gas extraction has moved into increasing deep water with increasing global demand for energy conventional platforms are being replaced by large floating structures such as the fpso that are anchored to the seabed through catenary or taut wire moorings murff et al 2005 randolph et al 2011 zhao et al 2016 as one of the anchor foundations the plate anchor has been increasingly used to provide a mooring system because of its relatively high efficiency and low costs they are usually embedded in soft clay ground and subjected to static tensional loads average loads from the floatage of platforms and cyclic loads from winds waves and currents in the marine environment dahlberg et al 2004 merifield et al 2001 anderson et al 2009 therefore evaluating the bearing capacity of plate anchors under the combination of average and cyclic loads in soft clays is of great significance in the engineering design in the previous research more attention has been paid to estimate the bearing capacity of plate anchors under monotonic static loads das and puri 1978 1980 1989 rowe and davis 1982 and merifield et al 2003 2005 studied the undrained behaviour of plate anchors and the influence of parameters including the embedment depth overburden pressure and breakaway condition on the failure mechanism and anchor static bearing capacity finite elements analysis or static limit analysis were performed by khatri et al 2009 yu et al 2011 fahmy et al 2013 charlton et al 2016 wu et al 2017 to investigate the effects of inclination angles clay non homogeneity and soil structure on the bearing capacity of plate anchors in addition some researchers such as song et al 2008 wang et al 2009 tho et al 2013 liu et al 2014 tian et al 2015 maitra et al 2019 used the large deformation finite element method to analyze the continuous pullout process failure mechanism and ultimate pullout capacity of plate anchors in clays compared with the monotonic static loads the research on the bearing capacity of plate anchors under cyclic loads is still relatively few the behaviours of circular plate anchors subjected to sinusoidal cyclic loading in a soft cohesive soil were reported by ponniah and finlay 1988 datta et al 1990 and singh and ramaswamy 2002 to investigate the influence of the average load and the cyclic amplitude on the permanent anchor movement by performing model tests singh and ramaswamy 2010 investigated the effects of cyclic frequency and pre loading on the behaviour of plate anchors in soft saturated clay yu et al 2015 focused on the strain softening behaviour of plate anchors in clay due to the disturbance of the cyclic loading the bearing capacity of plate anchors under cyclic loading mainly depends on the cyclic strength of surrounding clays the influence of cyclic loading on shear strength of clay is complex for a small number of cycles the cyclic strength is higher than the monotonic static strength due to the influence of loading rate however for more cycles the degradation of soil strength occurs resulting in lower than static strength andersen et al 1980 1988 this paper focuses on determinating the bearing capacity of plate anchors under the combination of average and cyclic loads in normal consolidation clays with linearly increasing shear strength by performing finite element analysis based on the abaqus software package the concept of global cyclic loading factor is introduced and relevant calculation formulas are suggested based on numerical simulation results to determine the cyclic bearing capacity of plate anchors 2 cyclic loading factor at present the common practice in engineering design is modifying the static anchor resistance by introducing a cyclic loading factor to obtain the anchor resistance under cyclic loading for example det norske veritas dnv rp e302 2002 suggested the following formula 1 r c y r s u c y where r c y is the cyclic anchor resistance r s is the static anchor resistance which can be determined according to the size and shape of plate anchor soil shear strength and bearing capacity factor u c y is the cyclic loading factor and satisfies 2 u c y τ f c y s u where s u is the undrained shear strength direct simple shear strength or the uu triaxial strength τ f c y is the cyclic shear strength accounts for both loading rate and cyclic degradation effects on s u the cyclic loading factor in purely two way cyclic loading is denoted u c y 0 the equivalent number of cycles to failure n e q v is defined as the number of cycles at a stress amplitude equal to τ f c y required to cause failure in cyclic loading as mentioned above the plate anchor is usually subjected to static tensional loads from the floatage of platforms and cyclic loads from winds waves and currents and these loads are transmitted to the anchor through catenary or taut wire moorings obviously both catenary and taut wire moorings can t bear the compression only the tension therefore plate anchors are usually subjected to one way cyclic loading and the cyclic loading factor u c y for one way cyclic loading depends on the normalized average shear stress τ a s u where τ a denotes the average shear stress actually andersen et al 1980 1988 did lots of triaxial and simple shear tests for drammen clays under the combination of average and cyclic loads to assess the effect of the average shear stress level τ a on the cyclic loading factor u c y det norske veritas dnv rp e302 2002 suggested u c y for a particular clay in purely two way cyclic loading can be expanded to one way cyclic loading by capitalization on laboratory test results for drammen clay subjected to one way cyclic loading the expression is as follows 3 u c y u c y d r a m m e n u c y 0 u c y 0 d r a m m e n 1 τ a s u τ a s u in which 4 u c y d r a m m e n a 0 a 1 τ a s u a 2 τ a s u 2 a 3 τ a s u 3 where u c y d r a m m e n is the cyclic loading factor for drammen clay u c y 0 d r a m m e n is the cyclic loading factor in purely two way cyclic loading for drammen clay and u c y 0 d r a m m e n a 0 the coefficients a 0 a 1 a 2 and a 3 depend on the equivalent number of cycles n e q v and are determined from laboratory tests on drammen clay subjected to one way cyclic loading the following expressions for the four coefficients are proposed 5 a 0 0 1401 ln n e q v 1 2415 a 1 0 0995 ln n e q v 1 0588 a 2 0 5795 ln n e q v 0 3426 a 3 0 6170 ln n e q v 1 6048 based on eqs 4 and 5 cyclic loading factor u c y versus τ a s u with various n e q v for drammen clay is shown in fig 1 obviously for any given τ a s u and n e q v one can get the corresponding u c y value for drammen clay by combining eqs 4 and 5 however it is a pity that fig 1 only gives the values for fewer cycles what would the curve look like for more cycles in curiosity we drew curves for n e q v 102 103 104 respectively as shown in the dotted line in fig 2 it is found that the change trend of the curves under the larger n e q v is completely different from that under the less n e q v which can be clearly reflected by the curves corresponding to n e q v 103 104 the predominant frequency of wave loads can be expected to range between 0 05 and 0 3 hz pappusetty and pando 2013 and the number of cycles due waves such as 0 1hz of frequency could exceed 108 over the design lifetime of the offshore structure such as 30 years design life hence the correctness of u c y value under large number of cycles is worth discussing the cyclic shear strength τ f c y in eq 2 can be defined as the sum of the average and cyclic shear stresses that cause failure after a given number of cycles andersen et al 1980 andersen and lauritzsen 1988 represented as 6 τ f c y τ a τ c y f τ a τ c y f where τ c y f denotes the amplitude of cyclic shear stress and then one can obtain 7 u c y τ f c y s u τ a τ c y f s u τ a s u τ c y f s u obviously u c y τ a s u in other words u c y τ a s u 1 the line of u c y τ a s u 1 is also plotted in fig 2 hence for any given n e q v the curve of u c y versus τ a s u should be above this line however some data points on the predicted curves corresponding to n e q v 103 104 are below this line and even u c y is negative under some τ a s u when n e q v is greater than 104 the corresponding curves are significant lower than this line although these curves are not drawn in the figure therefore the predictions based on eqs 4 and 5 proposed by dnv are unreasonable the expression of u c y d r a m m e n should be improved the correct trend may be that as n e q v increases the predicted curves should be closer to this line but never lower than this line based on the above analysis the following formula is proposed to redefine four coefficients of a 0 a 1 a 2 and a 3 8 a 0 1 2724 0 1919 ln n e q v 0 0165 ln n e q v 2 6 68 e 04 ln n e q v 3 1 02 e 05 ln n e q v 4 a 1 0 9653 0 1896 ln n e q v 0 0349 ln n e q v 2 0 0021 ln n e q v

e q v 4 the predicted curves based on eqs 4 and 8 for various n e q v are shown in fig 2 solid line the test data from andersen and lauritzsen 1988 are also shown in scatter points in fig 2 to verify rationality of predictions the drammen clay used in tests has an over consolidation ratio ocr of 1 the test data are obtained by performing a series of direct simple shear dss tests of soil elements subjected to both average shear stresses τ a and cyclic shear stresses τ c y the maximum number of cycles is 104 during tests the comparation indicates that both eq 5 and eq 8 can predict the test data very well for the less n e q v n e q v 25 such as n e q v 1 10 25 however for the larger n e q v n e q v 100 such as n e q v 102 103 104 eq 8 has better predictions regrettably there is a lack of test data for cycles greater than 104 it may be due to the difficulty of carrying out cyclic loading tests for a longer time so the predictions in these cases have not been verified the cases of n e q v 10 5 10 6 10 7 10 8 however as can be shown in the figure the predicted curves gradually approach the straight line of u c y τ a s u 1 with increasing n e q v and all curves are above the straight line which indicates the rationality of eq 8 proposed in this paper to a certain extent in addition there is a question worthy of discussion the cyclic loading factor u c y in eq 1 proposed by det norske veritas dnv rp e302 2002 is derived from test results of soil elements under the combination of average and cyclic stress which means that u c y is a specific value for one soil element when its average stress level represented as τ a s u and the equivalent number of cycles n e q v or cyclic stress level are given however when a plate anchor is subjected to the initial average load initial tensile load the average stress level for each soil element around the anchor is different as shown in fig 7 in section 3 4 and then the corresponding u c y for each soil element is also different hence we can t determine appropriate u c y in eq 1 based on eqs 4 and 5 or 8 here in our opinion a global cyclic loading factor u c y should be defined to replace the u c y which means that the cyclic anchor resistance r c y can be determined by the following formula 9 r c y r s u c y being different from u c y for only one soil element u c y is a global cyclic loading factor that considers the comprehensive results of all soil elements around the anchor plate under cyclic loading how to determine u c y for plate anchor under the combination of average and cyclic loads is described in detail below 3 numerical simulation method 3 1 numerical simulation planning a series of finite element simulations were carried out to systematically investigate the global cyclic loading factors u c y of plate anchors in clays under the combination of average and cyclic loads the anchor is firstly subjected to the initial static tension loads average loads r a and then to the cyclic loads r c y f r a r s and r c y f r s is obtained by normalizing r a and r c y f by static anchor resistance r s respectively which is used to represent the level of average loads and cyclic loads respectively various r a r s ranging from 0 to 1 and n e q v ranging from 100 to 108 are selected to determine u c y in the present numerical simulation the plate anchor has a width of 3m and a thickness of 0 3m the undrained shear strength of clays s u is assumed to increases linearly along the depth which is represented as s u 1 1 4 z and z is the depth of soil layer the distribution of anchor plate embedding and soil strength is shown in fig 3 β is the inclination angle of anchor plate relative to the horizontal direction b is the anchor width h is the anchor embedment depth that is the distance between the mud surface and the centre of the anchor plate h b is the embedment ratio of anchor various inclination angles and embedment depth are set to investigate their effects on u c y and among these cases more attention are paid to horizontal β 0 and vertical β 90 plate anchors at the shallow embedment case h b 2 and deep embedment case h b 8 3 2 finite element model two dimensional finite element models of plate anchors in normally consolidated clays were created using 6 node quadratic plane strain triangle elements cpe6 based on abaqus software as an example the finite element model of anchor plate for β 0 and h b 2 is shown in fig 4 the model boundaries are fixed along the base and horizontal translation is prevented at the sides trial computation results indicate that a model of size 21b 14b b 3m is sufficient to avoid boundary effects on simulation results the mesh around the anchor plate within one time anchor width is refined to improve the calculation accuracy see the refine area in fig 4 a mesh sensitivity study indicates that mesh coarseness has little effect on the simulation results when the number of nodes is more than 30000 in this paper the mesh contains about 35000 nodes for all finite element models a mohr coulomb failure criterion modeling elastic perfectly plastic behavior is adopted to simulate the behavior of the clay poisson s ratio μ 0 49 and friction and dilation angles ϕ ψ 0 are set to simulate the undrained condition khatri et al 2009 yu et al 2011 fahmy et al 2013 the plate anchor is assumed to be a perfectly rigid body the elastic modulus of clays is set as 500 s u it should be noted that the usdfld subroutine is used to define the undrained shear strength and elastic modulus linearly increasing along the soil depth at present the interface simulation can be divided into two categories after rowe et al 1982 namely immediate breakaway and no breakaway corresponding to vented and attached condition the former assumes that there is no suction exists between anchor and soil while the latter assumes that there is enough suction to ensure the anchor remains in contact with the soil at all times however the true breakaway state will fall somewhere between the extremities of the two cases representing the lower and upper bounds this study focuses on the relative value of cyclic bearing capacity and static bearing capacity that is the ratio of the two u c y rather than the absolute value of the two it can be found by trial calculation that the static bearing capacity under two interface conditions are quite different the value under no breakaway is significant larger than that under immediate breakaway however the u c y under two interface conditions are almost the same because the same interface condition is set to determine the static bearing capacity and cyclic bearing capacity hence the computation of u c y are mainly performed under immediate breakaway condition in addition the soil flow mechanism under immediate breakaway and no breakaway conditions is discussed by setting the corresponding contact conditions for the immediate breakaway condition the interface between the back of anchor plate and the surrounding clays is defined by tangential and normal behaviors in tangential behavior a penalty friction formulation is used with a friction coefficient of 0 to simulate smooth anchor plate while in normal behavior hard contact is defined for pressure overclosure jesmani et al 2012 islam et al 2019 and separation after contact is also allowed for the no breakaway condition the tie contact is set between the back of the anchor plate and the surrounding clays to ensure that the anchor is always in contact with the soils the numerical results are limited to clays without weight 3 3 validation of finite element model the pullout capacity of the plate anchor in weightless homogeneous clays s u 20 kpa is firstly calculated to verify the reliability of the numerical model in this paper by comparing with the existing research results the ultimate pullout capacity of plate anchor is generally expressed as a pullout capacity factor 10 n c r s a s u where n c is the pullout capacity factor r s is the static anchor resistance a is the plate area fig 5 shows the comparison of the current calculated results with those of merifield et al 2001 and yu et al 2011 for plate anchors with various inclination angles β ranging from 0 to 90 in the cases of shallow embedment condition h b 2 and deep embedment condition h b 8 for the vented anchor n c increases as the inclination angle increases in both shallow and deep embedment conditions and the increasing rate for the former is more significant than that for the latter for the attached anchor n c almost does not change with increasing inclination angles in the deep embedment condition but significantly decreases in the shallow embedment condition the calculated results in this paper agree well with previous results in the literature which validates the reliability of the numerical model 3 4 determination method of global cyclic loading factor the key to determine global cyclic loading factor u c y is to determine the cyclic bearing capacity it can be determined based on the new expression of cyclic loading factor u c y for drammen clay combining eq 4 and eq 8 proposed above by performing numerical simulation main steps are as follows 1 in the first step a monotonic loading numerical simulation are performed an uplift displacement is applied to the anchor plate until the failure occurs the static anchor resistance r s can be determined based on the numerical simulation results in this step the normalized load displacement curve under monotonic loading is shown in fig 6 in the figure r denotes the anchor resistance d is the displacement of anchor r r s is the anchor resistance normalized by r s d b is the displacement normalized by anchor plate width b 2 in the second step accroding to the normalized load displacement curve under monotonic loading above an uplift displacement d a such as 0 003b corresponding to the specific normalized resistance r a r s such as 0 5 is applied to the anchor plate to achive the initial tension static load r a average load at the end of this step shear stress components of each soil element in the whole soil domain are output which is the average shear stress τ a for each soil element then we can obtain the corresponding normalized average shear stress τ a s u a typical contour of τ a s u is shown in fig 7 r a r s 0 5 it can be seen that τ a s u of soil elements around the anchor is very different the value along the potential shear failure surface is usually larger and the closer to the anchor side the larger the value hence it is necessary to determine the cyclic loading factor according to different τ a s u for a given equivalent number of cycles n e q v such as n e q v 100 the corresponding cyclic loading factor u c y for each soil element can be determined using eqs 4 and 8 then we can obtain the cyclic shear strength τ f c y for each soil element by the formula of τ f c y s u u c y derived from eq 2 it should be noted that u c y is related to the stress path and the value has some difference for different loading stress paths such as triaxial compression triaxial extension and dss paths andersen and lauritzsen 1988 in fact for the inclined anchor plate the stress state of the surrounding soil is very complex many soil elements are not in the state of typical triaxial and dss in addition the huge computation cost may be a knotty problem when judging the stress path for all soil elements as a result it seems infeasible to judge the stress path of each soil element and then determine u c y according to different stress path therefore following the idea of dnv while considering the simplicity and feasibility of the calculation this study ignores the effect of stress path 3 in the third step the shear strength of each soil element is reset to τ f c y meanwhile the elastic modulus of clays is also reset to 500 τ f c y an uplift displacement is applied to the anchor plate until the failure occurs while the ultimate bearing capacity is achieved the ultimate bearing capacity obtained in this step is considered to be the cyclic anchor resistance r c y it is worth noting that this step is still monotonic loading in fact only the cyclic shear strength τ f c y is used to approximately reflect the influence of cyclic loading on the shear strength and the elastic modulus of soil thus indirectly reflecting the influence of cyclic loading on the ultimate bearing capacity 4 lastly the global cyclic loading factor u c y corresponding to the specific r a r s and n e q v can be determined by the formula of u c y r c y r s derived from eq 9 a flow chart of the above calculation process is shown in fig 8 according to the method we can determine u c y for any given r a r s and n e q v 4 numerical simulation results and discussion 4 1 load displacement behaviours fig 9 presents normalized load displacement curves for horizontal anchor at the embedment ratio of h b 2 under various combination of average and cyclic loads in fig 9 a b c the normalized average load r a r s is 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 respectively for all different equivalent number of cycles n e q v it can be seen from these figures that the pullout resistance of anchor plate increases as the displacement increases and the increasing rate is larger at the initial stage of loading and then decreases gradually the load displacement curve corresponds to the initial static loading average loads before the normalized load reaches r a r s subsequently it corresponds to the cyclic loading it should be noted that concept of cyclic shear strength τ f c y and the equivalent number of cycles n e q v is introduced into static finite element calculation to consider the influence of cyclic loading on soil responses rather than applying real cyclic loads to compute the cyclic soil response the load displacement curves are significantly different for different n e q v when n e q v is small such as n e q v 1 and 10 the anchor resistance is larger than the static anchor resistance but it decreases with the increase of n e q v the anchor resistance under cyclic loading mainly depends on the shear strength of surrounding clays the influence of cyclic loading on soil strength mainly includes two aspects loading rate and loading time or cycle number compared with the static monotonic loading the cyclic loading rate is usually higher so the cyclic shear strength is greater than the static strength however the long term cyclic loading will also lead to the degradation of soil strength therefore the loading rate dominates for the fewer cycles number but the cyclic degradation dominates for the larger cycles number as a result compared with the static anchor resistance the cyclic anchor resistance is larger for the fewer n e q v and smaller for larger n e q v for different normalized load r a r s different initial static tension load or displacement can be obtained which will lead to different distribution of initial static shear stress τ a as well as the cyclic shear strength τ f c y for each soil element in the whole soil domain as a result the cyclic anchor resistance r c y can be quite different for different n e q v at different r a r s as shown in the figure in addition no matter the horizontal anchor or the vertical anchor at the shallow embedment h b 2 or deep embedment cases h b 8 the change trend of load displacement curves for different n e q v is consistent for these cases hence the corresponding load displacement curves in other cases are not shown 4 2 soil flow mechanism figs 10 and 11 show the failure mechanism for horizontal and vertical vented and attached anchors under monotonic loading at shallow embedment h b 2 and deep embedment h b 8 cases respectively for the vented anchor in fig 10 the soil domain has obvious shear failure surface that extends to the seabed surface at the shallow embedment case resulting in significant heave deformation of the soil surface the anchor plate is separated from the soil behind it meanwhile a certain gap forms between them however the failure surface does not reach the ground surface and only the soil in the limited area in front of the anchor plate has a significant deformation at the deep embedment case compared with the horizontal anchor the failure surface for vertical one extends deeper into the soil with higher shear strength so vertical anchor plate has higher static anchor resistance than horizontal one for the attached anchor in fig 11 the shear zone extends a distance beneath the anchor because the soil and anchor are fully bonded together which significantly enhances the anchor resistance the failure surface becomes much shorter as the inclination angle increases which leads to a reduction in pullout capacity in addition the localization of plastic flow is very evident at the deep embedment case figs 12 and 13 show the soil flow mechanism of horizontal vented and attached anchors for different n e q v at the same anchor resistance respectively r a r s 0 5 the failure mechanism of plate anchors under the combination of average and cyclic loads has no significant difference compared with the one under monotonic loading average and cyclic loads only have a significant influence on the anchor resistance in other words the anchor displacement and the soil flow around the anchor is different at the same anchor resistance for different n e q v here the cyclic anchor resistance corresponding to n e q v 108 is taken as a reference standard obviously the soil flow is the most significant meanwhile the anchor failure has occurred for n e q v 108 as shown in figs 12 f and 13 f however the anchor failure does not occur for all other cases the soil flow for n e q v 1 and 10 is not as significant as that for static monotonic loading which is mainly because that cyclic shear strength of soil is higher than static strength for the fewer cycles number conversely the soil flow for n e q v 103 104 108 is more significant than that for static monotonic loading because the cyclic degradation of soil strength dominates for the larger cycles number hence long term cyclic loading will accelerate the soil flow and degrade the anchor resistance which should be paid attention over the design lifetime of the offshore structure in fact the anchor soil interface under cyclic loading should be between the two extreme cases of immediate breakaway to no breakaway and it is related to the embedment depth of the anchor plate and the level of cyclic loading generally speaking the anchor soil interface tends to be immediate breakaway under shallow embedment cases but it tends to be no breakaway under deep embedment cases due to high overburden earth pressure yu et al 2015 in addition in our opinion for high cyclic loading levels the anchor soil interface tends to be immediate breakaway due to large anchor displacement and for low cyclic loading levels it tends to be no breakaway due to the small anchor displacement therefore the anchor soil interface condition under cyclic loading is actually more complex which needs to carry out relevant model tests for further research and discussion in the future research work 4 3 global cyclic loading factor fig 14 presents the global cyclic loading factor u c y of plate anchor in drammen clay under the combination of average and cyclic loads for any given normalized average load r a r s and the equivalent number of cycles n e q v as shown in the figure u c y considering the comprehensive results of all soil elements around the anchor plate is really different from u c y for only one soil element shown in fig 2 no matter horizontal or vertical anchors at shallow or deep embedment cases u c y decreases as n e q v increases for any given r a r s however the difference of u c y for different n e q v at the same r a r s is the largest when r a r s is 0 and the difference gradually decreases as r a r s increases and then eventually tends to 0 actually u c y 1 for all cases when r a r s is 1 the special case mean that the failure of anchor has occurred when r a r s 1 initial static tension load r a equals to the static anchor resistance r s and hence the anchor can no longer bear any cyclic load at this case the cyclic anchor resistance r c y equals to the static anchor resistance r s therefore u c y 1 according to eq 9 in addition similarly to eq 7 u c y can be represented as 11 u c y r c y r s r a r c y f r s r a r s r c y f r s where r c y f denotes the amplitude of cyclic loads obviously u c y r a r s in other words u c y r a r s 1 the line of u c y r a r s 1 is plotted in fig 14 a for ease of understanding hence for any given n e q v the curve of u c y versus r a r s should be above this line it can be seen from the figure that the predicted curves are above this line for all n e q v ranging from 1 to 108 and the curves keep approaching this line as n e q v increases gradually which indicates that the predictions of u c y are reasonable in the figure the change trend of u c y versus r a r s is significant different for different n e q v when n e q v is relatively small n e q v 100 u c y increases gradually as r a r s increases until reach a peak value at a certain r a r s less than 1 and then decreases gradually and eventually tends to 1 the peak value and the corresponding r a r s are different for different n e q v however for the larger n e q v n e q v 100 u c y increases monotonically with the increase of r a r s and the minimum and maximum value is obtained when r a r s 0 and 1 respectively in addition it is worth noting that when r a r s 0 u c y is almost the same for the given n e q v regardless of inclination angles and embedment depth the reason is that τ a s u 0 due to r a r s 0 hence u c y a 0 for all soil elements according to eq 4 which means that u c y is the same for all soil elements and only related to n e q v not τ a s u as a result at this case u c y is almost the same as u c y shown in fig 2 for any given n e q v although the overall trend of u c y versus r a r s for given n e q v is not very different for horizontal or vertical anchor plate at the shallow h b 2 or deep h b 8 embedment cases the value of u c y has some differences to investigate furtherly the effects of inclination angles and embedment depth on u c y numerical simulations are performed for horizontal β 0 and vertical β 90 anchor plates at various embedment depth h b 2 4 6 8 and shallow and deep embedment anchor plates at various inclination angles β 0 30 45 60 90 the related predictions are shown in figs 15 and 16 respectively u c y decreases slightly with increasing the embedment depth from h b 2 to h b 8 for given n e q v such as n e q v 10 and 1000 as shown in fig 15 a and the decreasing rate becomes very small for β 90 as shown in fig 15 b inclination angles have also some effects on u c y as shown in fig 16 it can be seen that u c y decreases slightly with increasing inclination angles and the influence of inclination angles on u c y is smaller in deep embedment case compared with the shallow embedment case however overall both the embedment depth and inclination angles have no significant effects on u c y u c y versus r a r s with various n e q v for different embedment depth h b 2 and 8 and inclination angles β 0 and 90 can be plotted on the one graph and the average u c y can be obtained by curve fitting as shown in fig 17 it is similar to the idea of determining u c y above global cyclic loading factor u c y for drammen clay can be determined by the following formula based on the best fitting of the data in fig 17

2 and a 3 depend on the equivalent number of cycles n e q v and can be represented as 13 a 0 1 2730 0 1826 ln n e q v 0 0133 ln n e q v 2 3 37 e 04 ln n e q v 3 a 1 0 3945 0 1755 ln n e q v 0 0140 ln

the global cyclic loading factor u c y d r a m m e n versus r a r s with various n e q v for drammen clay are shown in fig 18 it should be noted that the loading rate has a certain influence on the cyclic strength of clays and then affects the cyclic anchor resistance this point can be considered according to the dnv specification a loading rate factor u r related with the strain rate of clays is used to consider the effect of loading rate as represented by the formula below 14 u r v v r e f n where v is actual strain rate hour v r e f is the reference strain rate n is an exponent which is dependent on type of soil and method of testing and the value is 0 04 for drammen clay according to the dnv specification if the cycle amplitude is high enough to fail the clay specimen during that first quarter of the first load cycle n e q v 1 the corresponding cyclic strength τ f c y of the clay divided by the static undrained shear strength s u is a measure of the loading rate factor u r for the actual clay as represented by u r τ f c y s u hence the loading rate factor u r is actually the cyclic loading factor u c y for n e q v 1 u c y for drammen clay in this paper is determined based on anderson et al s cyclic test data the cycle period is set to 10 s 0 1hz during tests time to failure is 2 5 s 1 4 cycle period the failure strain is 10 hence the strain loading rate is 14400 hour if the strain rate with a cycle period of 10 s is taken as the reference strain rate the loading rate factor u r can be determined by u r v 14400 0 04 then the cyclic loading factor u c y d r a m m e n and the global cyclic loading factor u c y d r a m m e n for any loading rate cycle period can be determined by the formulas 15 u c y d r a m m e n u r u c y d r a m m e n 16 u c y d r a m m e n u r u c y d r a m m e n as an example the loading rate factor u r for different loading rate cycle period is shown in table 1 referring to the method of determining cyclic loading factor u c y for a particular clay recommended by det norske veritas dnv rp e302 2002 u c y of plate anchors in a particular clay can be determined based on u c y d r a m m e n for drammen clay the expression is as follows 17 u c y u c y d r a m m e n u c y 0 u c y 0 d r a m m e n 1 r a r s r a r s where u c y 0 d r a m m e n and u c y 0 is the global cyclic loading factor in r a r s 0 for drammen clay and particular clay respectively the rationality of the proposed formula for global cyclic loading factor u c y is verified by comparing predictions with model test data from cheng et al 2020 the behaviours of plate anchors subjected to combined average and cyclic loads in soft clays were investigated in the model test a static tensional load average load r a was first applied to the plate anchor and then a sinusoidal cyclic load with a peak value of r c y f was applied to the anchor in the load controlled mode during tests finally the failure of plate anchor occurred after loading n e q v cycles the cyclic loading frequency is 0 1 hz the normalized average load r a r s is 0 5 the details of the model test can be seen in the literature the predictions and test data of u c y for different n e q v are shown in fig 19 obviously it can be seen that the proposed formula can better predict the model test results than dnv formula which proves the rationality of the formula to a certain extent regrettably the number of test cases in the literature is very limited and there are few related model test data of plate anchor under cyclic loading in other existing literatures therefore more model tests with different combination of average and cyclic loads should be carried out in the next research work to further verify the rationality of the proposed formula for u c y 5 conclusions the bearing capacity of plate anchors under the combination of average and cyclic loads in normal consolidation clays with linearly increasing shear strength was investigated by performing finite element analysis the key conclusions can be summarized as follows the cyclic loading factor u c y is closely related to the normalized average shear stress τ a s u and the equivalent number of cycles n e q v this paper points out that the expression of u c y for drammen clay proposed by det norske veritas dnv rp e302 2002 can not reasonably predict the value corresponding to large equivalent number of cycles such as n e q v 1000 however the number of cycles due waves could even exceed 108 over the design lifetime of the offshore structure therefore a more reasonable expression is proposed to determine the cyclic loading factor in this paper in addition it is also unreasonable to use u c y for one soil element to determine the cyclic anchor resistance as suggested by det norske veritas when a plate anchor is subjected to the initial average load initial tensile load the average stress level for each soil element around the anchor is different and then the corresponding u c y for each soil element is also different hence a global cyclic loading factor u c y should be defined to replace the u c y to determine the cyclic anchor resistance finite element models for computing the anchor resistance are developed and validated by comparing with the existing research results the method to determine the global cyclic loading factor u c y by finite element analysis is suggested the u c y for any given normalized average loads r a r s and n e q v can be determined by performing a series of numerical simulations the cyclic anchor resistance r c y can be quite different for different n e q v at different r a r s the soil cyclic shear strength is greater than the static strength because of the higher loading rate however the long term cyclic loading will also lead to the degradation of soil strength therefore the loading rate dominates for the fewer cycles number but the cyclic degradation dominates for the larger cycles number as a result compared with the static anchor resistance the cyclic anchor resistance is larger for the fewer n e q v and smaller for larger n e q v long term cyclic loading will accelerate the soil flow and degrade the anchor resistance which should be paid attention over the design lifetime of the offshore structure the effects of the embedment depth and inclination angles on u c y are investigated by performing numerical simulations the related predictions indicate u c y decreases slightly with increasing the embedment depth or inclination angles for given n e q v however overall the embedment depth and inclination angles have no significant effects on u c y based on the average u c y for different embedment depth and inclination angles an expression of u c y associated with r a r s and n e q v are proposed which can provide some reference for the engineering design of the plate anchor under cyclic loads credit authorship contribution statement xinglei cheng conceptualization methodology

20450,plate anchors has been widely adopted to provide uplift resistance for offshore floating facilities the research on the bearing capacity of plate anchors under cyclic loads is still relatively rare compared with the monotonic loads in the present paper the bearing capacity of plate anchors under the combination of average and cyclic loads in normal consolidation clays with linearly increasing shear strength is investigated by performing finite element analysis a more reasonable expression is proposed to determine the cyclic loading factor u c y by modifying the formula suggested by det norske veritas a global cyclic loading factor u c y is defined to determine the cyclic anchor resistance considering the difference of average stress level for each soil element around the anchor the method to determine u c y by finite element analysis is suggested and then the u c y for any given normalized average loads and the equivalent number of cycles is determined the effects of the embedment depth and inclination angles on u c y are also investigated by performing a series of numerical simulations an expression of u c y associated with normalized average loads and the equivalent number of cycles are proposed based on numerical results which can provide some reference for the engineering design of plate anchors under cyclic loads keywords plate anchors clays bearing capacity cyclic loads offshore geotechnics finite element analysis 1 introduction oil and gas extraction has moved into increasing deep water with increasing global demand for energy conventional platforms are being replaced by large floating structures such as the fpso that are anchored to the seabed through catenary or taut wire moorings murff et al 2005 randolph et al 2011 zhao et al 2016 as one of the anchor foundations the plate anchor has been increasingly used to provide a mooring system because of its relatively high efficiency and low costs they are usually embedded in soft clay ground and subjected to static tensional loads average loads from the floatage of platforms and cyclic loads from winds waves and currents in the marine environment dahlberg et al 2004 merifield et al 2001 anderson et al 2009 therefore evaluating the bearing capacity of plate anchors under the combination of average and cyclic loads in soft clays is of great significance in the engineering design in the previous research more attention has been paid to estimate the bearing capacity of plate anchors under monotonic static loads das and puri 1978 1980 1989 rowe and davis 1982 and merifield et al 2003 2005 studied the undrained behaviour of plate anchors and the influence of parameters including the embedment depth overburden pressure and breakaway condition on the failure mechanism and anchor static bearing capacity finite elements analysis or static limit analysis were performed by khatri et al 2009 yu et al 2011 fahmy et al 2013 charlton et al 2016 wu et al 2017 to investigate the effects of inclination angles clay non homogeneity and soil structure on the bearing capacity of plate anchors in addition some researchers such as song et al 2008 wang et al 2009 tho et al 2013 liu et al 2014 tian et al 2015 maitra et al 2019 used the large deformation finite element method to analyze the continuous pullout process failure mechanism and ultimate pullout capacity of plate anchors in clays compared with the monotonic static loads the research on the bearing capacity of plate anchors under cyclic loads is still relatively few the behaviours of circular plate anchors subjected to sinusoidal cyclic loading in a soft cohesive soil were reported by ponniah and finlay 1988 datta et al 1990 and singh and ramaswamy 2002 to investigate the influence of the average load and the cyclic amplitude on the permanent anchor movement by performing model tests singh and ramaswamy 2010 investigated the effects of cyclic frequency and pre loading on the behaviour of plate anchors in soft saturated clay yu et al 2015 focused on the strain softening behaviour of plate anchors in clay due to the disturbance of the cyclic loading the bearing capacity of plate anchors under cyclic loading mainly depends on the cyclic strength of surrounding clays the influence of cyclic loading on shear strength of clay is complex for a small number of cycles the cyclic strength is higher than the monotonic static strength due to the influence of loading rate however for more cycles the degradation of soil strength occurs resulting in lower than static strength andersen et al 1980 1988 this paper focuses on determinating the bearing capacity of plate anchors under the combination of average and cyclic loads in normal consolidation clays with linearly increasing shear strength by performing finite element analysis based on the abaqus software package the concept of global cyclic loading factor is introduced and relevant calculation formulas are suggested based on numerical simulation results to determine the cyclic bearing capacity of plate anchors 2 cyclic loading factor at present the common practice in engineering design is modifying the static anchor resistance by introducing a cyclic loading factor to obtain the anchor resistance under cyclic loading for example det norske veritas dnv rp e302 2002 suggested the following formula 1 r c y r s u c y where r c y is the cyclic anchor resistance r s is the static anchor resistance which can be determined according to the size and shape of plate anchor soil shear strength and bearing capacity factor u c y is the cyclic loading factor and satisfies 2 u c y τ f c y s u where s u is the undrained shear strength direct simple shear strength or the uu triaxial strength τ f c y is the cyclic shear strength accounts for both loading rate and cyclic degradation effects on s u the cyclic loading factor in purely two way cyclic loading is denoted u c y 0 the equivalent number of cycles to failure n e q v is defined as the number of cycles at a stress amplitude equal to τ f c y required to cause failure in cyclic loading as mentioned above the plate anchor is usually subjected to static tensional loads from the floatage of platforms and cyclic loads from winds waves and currents and these loads are transmitted to the anchor through catenary or taut wire moorings obviously both catenary and taut wire moorings can t bear the compression only the tension therefore plate anchors are usually subjected to one way cyclic loading and the cyclic loading factor u c y for one way cyclic loading depends on the normalized average shear stress τ a s u where τ a denotes the average shear stress actually andersen et al 1980 1988 did lots of triaxial and simple shear tests for drammen clays under the combination of average and cyclic loads to assess the effect of the average shear stress level τ a on the cyclic loading factor u c y det norske veritas dnv rp e302 2002 suggested u c y for a particular clay in purely two way cyclic loading can be expanded to one way cyclic loading by capitalization on laboratory test results for drammen clay subjected to one way cyclic loading the expression is as follows 3 u c y u c y d r a m m e n u c y 0 u c y 0 d r a m m e n 1 τ a s u τ a s u in which 4 u c y d r a m m e n a 0 a 1 τ a s u a 2 τ a s u 2 a 3 τ a s u 3 where u c y d r a m m e n is the cyclic loading factor for drammen clay u c y 0 d r a m m e n is the cyclic loading factor in purely two way cyclic loading for drammen clay and u c y 0 d r a m m e n a 0 the coefficients a 0 a 1 a 2 and a 3 depend on the equivalent number of cycles n e q v and are determined from laboratory tests on drammen clay subjected to one way cyclic loading the following expressions for the four coefficients are proposed 5 a 0 0 1401 ln n e q v 1 2415 a 1 0 0995 ln n e q v 1 0588 a 2 0 5795 ln n e q v 0 3426 a 3 0 6170 ln n e q v 1 6048 based on eqs 4 and 5 cyclic loading factor u c y versus τ a s u with various n e q v for drammen clay is shown in fig 1 obviously for any given τ a s u and n e q v one can get the corresponding u c y value for drammen clay by combining eqs 4 and 5 however it is a pity that fig 1 only gives the values for fewer cycles what would the curve look like for more cycles in curiosity we drew curves for n e q v 102 103 104 respectively as shown in the dotted line in fig 2 it is found that the change trend of the curves under the larger n e q v is completely different from that under the less n e q v which can be clearly reflected by the curves corresponding to n e q v 103 104 the predominant frequency of wave loads can be expected to range between 0 05 and 0 3 hz pappusetty and pando 2013 and the number of cycles due waves such as 0 1hz of frequency could exceed 108 over the design lifetime of the offshore structure such as 30 years design life hence the correctness of u c y value under large number of cycles is worth discussing the cyclic shear strength τ f c y in eq 2 can be defined as the sum of the average and cyclic shear stresses that cause failure after a given number of cycles andersen et al 1980 andersen and lauritzsen 1988 represented as 6 τ f c y τ a τ c y f τ a τ c y f where τ c y f denotes the amplitude of cyclic shear stress and then one can obtain 7 u c y τ f c y s u τ a τ c y f s u τ a s u τ c y f s u obviously u c y τ a s u in other words u c y τ a s u 1 the line of u c y τ a s u 1 is also plotted in fig 2 hence for any given n e q v the curve of u c y versus τ a s u should be above this line however some data points on the predicted curves corresponding to n e q v 103 104 are below this line and even u c y is negative under some τ a s u when n e q v is greater than 104 the corresponding curves are significant lower than this line although these curves are not drawn in the figure therefore the predictions based on eqs 4 and 5 proposed by dnv are unreasonable the expression of u c y d r a m m e n should be improved the correct trend may be that as n e q v increases the predicted curves should be closer to this line but never lower than this line based on the above analysis the following formula is proposed to redefine four coefficients of a 0 a 1 a 2 and a 3 8 a 0 1 2724 0 1919 ln n e q v 0 0165 ln n e q v 2 6 68 e 04 ln n e q v 3 1 02 e 05 ln n e q v 4 a 1 0 9653 0 1896 ln n e q v 0 0349 ln n e q v 2 0 0021 ln n e q v

e q v 4 the predicted curves based on eqs 4 and 8 for various n e q v are shown in fig 2 solid line the test data from andersen and lauritzsen 1988 are also shown in scatter points in fig 2 to verify rationality of predictions the drammen clay used in tests has an over consolidation ratio ocr of 1 the test data are obtained by performing a series of direct simple shear dss tests of soil elements subjected to both average shear stresses τ a and cyclic shear stresses τ c y the maximum number of cycles is 104 during tests the comparation indicates that both eq 5 and eq 8 can predict the test data very well for the less n e q v n e q v 25 such as n e q v 1 10 25 however for the larger n e q v n e q v 100 such as n e q v 102 103 104 eq 8 has better predictions regrettably there is a lack of test data for cycles greater than 104 it may be due to the difficulty of carrying out cyclic loading tests for a longer time so the predictions in these cases have not been verified the cases of n e q v 10 5 10 6 10 7 10 8 however as can be shown in the figure the predicted curves gradually approach the straight line of u c y τ a s u 1 with increasing n e q v and all curves are above the straight line which indicates the rationality of eq 8 proposed in this paper to a certain extent in addition there is a question worthy of discussion the cyclic loading factor u c y in eq 1 proposed by det norske veritas dnv rp e302 2002 is derived from test results of soil elements under the combination of average and cyclic stress which means that u c y is a specific value for one soil element when its average stress level represented as τ a s u and the equivalent number of cycles n e q v or cyclic stress level are given however when a plate anchor is subjected to the initial average load initial tensile load the average stress level for each soil element around the anchor is different as shown in fig 7 in section 3 4 and then the corresponding u c y for each soil element is also different hence we can t determine appropriate u c y in eq 1 based on eqs 4 and 5 or 8 here in our opinion a global cyclic loading factor u c y should be defined to replace the u c y which means that the cyclic anchor resistance r c y can be determined by the following formula 9 r c y r s u c y being different from u c y for only one soil element u c y is a global cyclic loading factor that considers the comprehensive results of all soil elements around the anchor plate under cyclic loading how to determine u c y for plate anchor under the combination of average and cyclic loads is described in detail below 3 numerical simulation method 3 1 numerical simulation planning a series of finite element simulations were carried out to systematically investigate the global cyclic loading factors u c y of plate anchors in clays under the combination of average and cyclic loads the anchor is firstly subjected to the initial static tension loads average loads r a and then to the cyclic loads r c y f r a r s and r c y f r s is obtained by normalizing r a and r c y f by static anchor resistance r s respectively which is used to represent the level of average loads and cyclic loads respectively various r a r s ranging from 0 to 1 and n e q v ranging from 100 to 108 are selected to determine u c y in the present numerical simulation the plate anchor has a width of 3m and a thickness of 0 3m the undrained shear strength of clays s u is assumed to increases linearly along the depth which is represented as s u 1 1 4 z and z is the depth of soil layer the distribution of anchor plate embedding and soil strength is shown in fig 3 β is the inclination angle of anchor plate relative to the horizontal direction b is the anchor width h is the anchor embedment depth that is the distance between the mud surface and the centre of the anchor plate h b is the embedment ratio of anchor various inclination angles and embedment depth are set to investigate their effects on u c y and among these cases more attention are paid to horizontal β 0 and vertical β 90 plate anchors at the shallow embedment case h b 2 and deep embedment case h b 8 3 2 finite element model two dimensional finite element models of plate anchors in normally consolidated clays were created using 6 node quadratic plane strain triangle elements cpe6 based on abaqus software as an example the finite element model of anchor plate for β 0 and h b 2 is shown in fig 4 the model boundaries are fixed along the base and horizontal translation is prevented at the sides trial computation results indicate that a model of size 21b 14b b 3m is sufficient to avoid boundary effects on simulation results the mesh around the anchor plate within one time anchor width is refined to improve the calculation accuracy see the refine area in fig 4 a mesh sensitivity study indicates that mesh coarseness has little effect on the simulation results when the number of nodes is more than 30000 in this paper the mesh contains about 35000 nodes for all finite element models a mohr coulomb failure criterion modeling elastic perfectly plastic behavior is adopted to simulate the behavior of the clay poisson s ratio μ 0 49 and friction and dilation angles ϕ ψ 0 are set to simulate the undrained condition khatri et al 2009 yu et al 2011 fahmy et al 2013 the plate anchor is assumed to be a perfectly rigid body the elastic modulus of clays is set as 500 s u it should be noted that the usdfld subroutine is used to define the undrained shear strength and elastic modulus linearly increasing along the soil depth at present the interface simulation can be divided into two categories after rowe et al 1982 namely immediate breakaway and no breakaway corresponding to vented and attached condition the former assumes that there is no suction exists between anchor and soil while the latter assumes that there is enough suction to ensure the anchor remains in contact with the soil at all times however the true breakaway state will fall somewhere between the extremities of the two cases representing the lower and upper bounds this study focuses on the relative value of cyclic bearing capacity and static bearing capacity that is the ratio of the two u c y rather than the absolute value of the two it can be found by trial calculation that the static bearing capacity under two interface conditions are quite different the value under no breakaway is significant larger than that under immediate breakaway however the u c y under two interface conditions are almost the same because the same interface condition is set to determine the static bearing capacity and cyclic bearing capacity hence the computation of u c y are mainly performed under immediate breakaway condition in addition the soil flow mechanism under immediate breakaway and no breakaway conditions is discussed by setting the corresponding contact conditions for the immediate breakaway condition the interface between the back of anchor plate and the surrounding clays is defined by tangential and normal behaviors in tangential behavior a penalty friction formulation is used with a friction coefficient of 0 to simulate smooth anchor plate while in normal behavior hard contact is defined for pressure overclosure jesmani et al 2012 islam et al 2019 and separation after contact is also allowed for the no breakaway condition the tie contact is set between the back of the anchor plate and the surrounding clays to ensure that the anchor is always in contact with the soils the numerical results are limited to clays without weight 3 3 validation of finite element model the pullout capacity of the plate anchor in weightless homogeneous clays s u 20 kpa is firstly calculated to verify the reliability of the numerical model in this paper by comparing with the existing research results the ultimate pullout capacity of plate anchor is generally expressed as a pullout capacity factor 10 n c r s a s u where n c is the pullout capacity factor r s is the static anchor resistance a is the plate area fig 5 shows the comparison of the current calculated results with those of merifield et al 2001 and yu et al 2011 for plate anchors with various inclination angles β ranging from 0 to 90 in the cases of shallow embedment condition h b 2 and deep embedment condition h b 8 for the vented anchor n c increases as the inclination angle increases in both shallow and deep embedment conditions and the increasing rate for the former is more significant than that for the latter for the attached anchor n c almost does not change with increasing inclination angles in the deep embedment condition but significantly decreases in the shallow embedment condition the calculated results in this paper agree well with previous results in the literature which validates the reliability of the numerical model 3 4 determination method of global cyclic loading factor the key to determine global cyclic loading factor u c y is to determine the cyclic bearing capacity it can be determined based on the new expression of cyclic loading factor u c y for drammen clay combining eq 4 and eq 8 proposed above by performing numerical simulation main steps are as follows 1 in the first step a monotonic loading numerical simulation are performed an uplift displacement is applied to the anchor plate until the failure occurs the static anchor resistance r s can be determined based on the numerical simulation results in this step the normalized load displacement curve under monotonic loading is shown in fig 6 in the figure r denotes the anchor resistance d is the displacement of anchor r r s is the anchor resistance normalized by r s d b is the displacement normalized by anchor plate width b 2 in the second step accroding to the normalized load displacement curve under monotonic loading above an uplift displacement d a such as 0 003b corresponding to the specific normalized resistance r a r s such as 0 5 is applied to the anchor plate to achive the initial tension static load r a average load at the end of this step shear stress components of each soil element in the whole soil domain are output which is the average shear stress τ a for each soil element then we can obtain the corresponding normalized average shear stress τ a s u a typical contour of τ a s u is shown in fig 7 r a r s 0 5 it can be seen that τ a s u of soil elements around the anchor is very different the value along the potential shear failure surface is usually larger and the closer to the anchor side the larger the value hence it is necessary to determine the cyclic loading factor according to different τ a s u for a given equivalent number of cycles n e q v such as n e q v 100 the corresponding cyclic loading factor u c y for each soil element can be determined using eqs 4 and 8 then we can obtain the cyclic shear strength τ f c y for each soil element by the formula of τ f c y s u u c y derived from eq 2 it should be noted that u c y is related to the stress path and the value has some difference for different loading stress paths such as triaxial compression triaxial extension and dss paths andersen and lauritzsen 1988 in fact for the inclined anchor plate the stress state of the surrounding soil is very complex many soil elements are not in the state of typical triaxial and dss in addition the huge computation cost may be a knotty problem when judging the stress path for all soil elements as a result it seems infeasible to judge the stress path of each soil element and then determine u c y according to different stress path therefore following the idea of dnv while considering the simplicity and feasibility of the calculation this study ignores the effect of stress path 3 in the third step the shear strength of each soil element is reset to τ f c y meanwhile the elastic modulus of clays is also reset to 500 τ f c y an uplift displacement is applied to the anchor plate until the failure occurs while the ultimate bearing capacity is achieved the ultimate bearing capacity obtained in this step is considered to be the cyclic anchor resistance r c y it is worth noting that this step is still monotonic loading in fact only the cyclic shear strength τ f c y is used to approximately reflect the influence of cyclic loading on the shear strength and the elastic modulus of soil thus indirectly reflecting the influence of cyclic loading on the ultimate bearing capacity 4 lastly the global cyclic loading factor u c y corresponding to the specific r a r s and n e q v can be determined by the formula of u c y r c y r s derived from eq 9 a flow chart of the above calculation process is shown in fig 8 according to the method we can determine u c y for any given r a r s and n e q v 4 numerical simulation results and discussion 4 1 load displacement behaviours fig 9 presents normalized load displacement curves for horizontal anchor at the embedment ratio of h b 2 under various combination of average and cyclic loads in fig 9 a b c the normalized average load r a r s is 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 respectively for all different equivalent number of cycles n e q v it can be seen from these figures that the pullout resistance of anchor plate increases as the displacement increases and the increasing rate is larger at the initial stage of loading and then decreases gradually the load displacement curve corresponds to the initial static loading average loads before the normalized load reaches r a r s subsequently it corresponds to the cyclic loading it should be noted that concept of cyclic shear strength τ f c y and the equivalent number of cycles n e q v is introduced into static finite element calculation to consider the influence of cyclic loading on soil responses rather than applying real cyclic loads to compute the cyclic soil response the load displacement curves are significantly different for different n e q v when n e q v is small such as n e q v 1 and 10 the anchor resistance is larger than the static anchor resistance but it decreases with the increase of n e q v the anchor resistance under cyclic loading mainly depends on the shear strength of surrounding clays the influence of cyclic loading on soil strength mainly includes two aspects loading rate and loading time or cycle number compared with the static monotonic loading the cyclic loading rate is usually higher so the cyclic shear strength is greater than the static strength however the long term cyclic loading will also lead to the degradation of soil strength therefore the loading rate dominates for the fewer cycles number but the cyclic degradation dominates for the larger cycles number as a result compared with the static anchor resistance the cyclic anchor resistance is larger for the fewer n e q v and smaller for larger n e q v for different normalized load r a r s different initial static tension load or displacement can be obtained which will lead to different distribution of initial static shear stress τ a as well as the cyclic shear strength τ f c y for each soil element in the whole soil domain as a result the cyclic anchor resistance r c y can be quite different for different n e q v at different r a r s as shown in the figure in addition no matter the horizontal anchor or the vertical anchor at the shallow embedment h b 2 or deep embedment cases h b 8 the change trend of load displacement curves for different n e q v is consistent for these cases hence the corresponding load displacement curves in other cases are not shown 4 2 soil flow mechanism figs 10 and 11 show the failure mechanism for horizontal and vertical vented and attached anchors under monotonic loading at shallow embedment h b 2 and deep embedment h b 8 cases respectively for the vented anchor in fig 10 the soil domain has obvious shear failure surface that extends to the seabed surface at the shallow embedment case resulting in significant heave deformation of the soil surface the anchor plate is separated from the soil behind it meanwhile a certain gap forms between them however the failure surface does not reach the ground surface and only the soil in the limited area in front of the anchor plate has a significant deformation at the deep embedment case compared with the horizontal anchor the failure surface for vertical one extends deeper into the soil with higher shear strength so vertical anchor plate has higher static anchor resistance than horizontal one for the attached anchor in fig 11 the shear zone extends a distance beneath the anchor because the soil and anchor are fully bonded together which significantly enhances the anchor resistance the failure surface becomes much shorter as the inclination angle increases which leads to a reduction in pullout capacity in addition the localization of plastic flow is very evident at the deep embedment case figs 12 and 13 show the soil flow mechanism of horizontal vented and attached anchors for different n e q v at the same anchor resistance respectively r a r s 0 5 the failure mechanism of plate anchors under the combination of average and cyclic loads has no significant difference compared with the one under monotonic loading average and cyclic loads only have a significant influence on the anchor resistance in other words the anchor displacement and the soil flow around the anchor is different at the same anchor resistance for different n e q v here the cyclic anchor resistance corresponding to n e q v 108 is taken as a reference standard obviously the soil flow is the most significant meanwhile the anchor failure has occurred for n e q v 108 as shown in figs 12 f and 13 f however the anchor failure does not occur for all other cases the soil flow for n e q v 1 and 10 is not as significant as that for static monotonic loading which is mainly because that cyclic shear strength of soil is higher than static strength for the fewer cycles number conversely the soil flow for n e q v 103 104 108 is more significant than that for static monotonic loading because the cyclic degradation of soil strength dominates for the larger cycles number hence long term cyclic loading will accelerate the soil flow and degrade the anchor resistance which should be paid attention over the design lifetime of the offshore structure in fact the anchor soil interface under cyclic loading should be between the two extreme cases of immediate breakaway to no breakaway and it is related to the embedment depth of the anchor plate and the level of cyclic loading generally speaking the anchor soil interface tends to be immediate breakaway under shallow embedment cases but it tends to be no breakaway under deep embedment cases due to high overburden earth pressure yu et al 2015 in addition in our opinion for high cyclic loading levels the anchor soil interface tends to be immediate breakaway due to large anchor displacement and for low cyclic loading levels it tends to be no breakaway due to the small anchor displacement therefore the anchor soil interface condition under cyclic loading is actually more complex which needs to carry out relevant model tests for further research and discussion in the future research work 4 3 global cyclic loading factor fig 14 presents the global cyclic loading factor u c y of plate anchor in drammen clay under the combination of average and cyclic loads for any given normalized average load r a r s and the equivalent number of cycles n e q v as shown in the figure u c y considering the comprehensive results of all soil elements around the anchor plate is really different from u c y for only one soil element shown in fig 2 no matter horizontal or vertical anchors at shallow or deep embedment cases u c y decreases as n e q v increases for any given r a r s however the difference of u c y for different n e q v at the same r a r s is the largest when r a r s is 0 and the difference gradually decreases as r a r s increases and then eventually tends to 0 actually u c y 1 for all cases when r a r s is 1 the special case mean that the failure of anchor has occurred when r a r s 1 initial static tension load r a equals to the static anchor resistance r s and hence the anchor can no longer bear any cyclic load at this case the cyclic anchor resistance r c y equals to the static anchor resistance r s therefore u c y 1 according to eq 9 in addition similarly to eq 7 u c y can be represented as 11 u c y r c y r s r a r c y f r s r a r s r c y f r s where r c y f denotes the amplitude of cyclic loads obviously u c y r a r s in other words u c y r a r s 1 the line of u c y r a r s 1 is plotted in fig 14 a for ease of understanding hence for any given n e q v the curve of u c y versus r a r s should be above this line it can be seen from the figure that the predicted curves are above this line for all n e q v ranging from 1 to 108 and the curves keep approaching this line as n e q v increases gradually which indicates that the predictions of u c y are reasonable in the figure the change trend of u c y versus r a r s is significant different for different n e q v when n e q v is relatively small n e q v 100 u c y increases gradually as r a r s increases until reach a peak value at a certain r a r s less than 1 and then decreases gradually and eventually tends to 1 the peak value and the corresponding r a r s are different for different n e q v however for the larger n e q v n e q v 100 u c y increases monotonically with the increase of r a r s and the minimum and maximum value is obtained when r a r s 0 and 1 respectively in addition it is worth noting that when r a r s 0 u c y is almost the same for the given n e q v regardless of inclination angles and embedment depth the reason is that τ a s u 0 due to r a r s 0 hence u c y a 0 for all soil elements according to eq 4 which means that u c y is the same for all soil elements and only related to n e q v not τ a s u as a result at this case u c y is almost the same as u c y shown in fig 2 for any given n e q v although the overall trend of u c y versus r a r s for given n e q v is not very different for horizontal or vertical anchor plate at the shallow h b 2 or deep h b 8 embedment cases the value of u c y has some differences to investigate furtherly the effects of inclination angles and embedment depth on u c y numerical simulations are performed for horizontal β 0 and vertical β 90 anchor plates at various embedment depth h b 2 4 6 8 and shallow and deep embedment anchor plates at various inclination angles β 0 30 45 60 90 the related predictions are shown in figs 15 and 16 respectively u c y decreases slightly with increasing the embedment depth from h b 2 to h b 8 for given n e q v such as n e q v 10 and 1000 as shown in fig 15 a and the decreasing rate becomes very small for β 90 as shown in fig 15 b inclination angles have also some effects on u c y as shown in fig 16 it can be seen that u c y decreases slightly with increasing inclination angles and the influence of inclination angles on u c y is smaller in deep embedment case compared with the shallow embedment case however overall both the embedment depth and inclination angles have no significant effects on u c y u c y versus r a r s with various n e q v for different embedment depth h b 2 and 8 and inclination angles β 0 and 90 can be plotted on the one graph and the average u c y can be obtained by curve fitting as shown in fig 17 it is similar to the idea of determining u c y above global cyclic loading factor u c y for drammen clay can be determined by the following formula based on the best fitting of the data in fig 17 12 u c y d r a m m e n a 0 a 1 r a r s a 2 r a r s 2 a 3 r a r s 3 where u c y d r a m m e n is the global cyclic loading factor for drammen clay and u c y d r a m m e n a 0 the coefficients a 0 a 1 a 2 and a 3 depend on the equivalent number of cycles n e q v and can be represented as 13 a 0 1 2730 0 1826 ln n e q v 0 0133 ln n e q v 2 3 37 e 04 ln n e q v 3 a 1 0 3945 0 1755 ln n e q v 0 0140 ln n e q v 2 3 68 e 04 ln n e q v 3 a 2 1 3618 0 1001 ln n e q v 0 0051 ln n e q v 2 9 57 e 05 ln n e q v 3 a 3 0 6950 0 0930 ln n e q v 0 0058 ln n e q v 2 1 27 e 04 ln n e q v 3 based on eqs 12 and 13 the global cyclic loading factor u c y d r a m m e n versus r a r s with various n e q v for drammen clay are shown in fig 18 it should be noted that the loading rate has a certain influence on the cyclic strength of clays and then affects the cyclic anchor resistance this point can be considered according to the dnv specification a loading rate factor u r related with the strain rate of clays is used to consider the effect of loading rate as represented by the formula below 14 u r v v r e f n where v is actual strain rate hour v r e f is the reference strain rate n is an exponent which is dependent on type of soil and method of testing and the value is 0 04 for drammen clay according to the dnv specification if the cycle amplitude is high enough to fail the clay specimen during that first quarter of the first load cycle n e q v 1 the corresponding cyclic strength τ f c y of the clay divided by the static undrained shear strength s u is a measure of the loading rate factor u r for the actual clay as represented by u r τ f c y s u hence the loading rate factor u r is actually the cyclic loading factor u c y for n e q v 1 u c y for drammen clay in this paper is determined based on anderson et al s cyclic test data the cycle period is set to 10 s 0 1hz during tests time to failure is 2 5 s 1 4 cycle period the failure strain is 10 hence the strain loading rate is 14400 hour if the strain rate with a cycle period of 10 s is taken as the reference strain rate the loading rate factor u r can be determined by u r v 14400 0 04 then the cyclic loading factor u c y d r a m m e n and the global cyclic loading factor u c y d r a m m e n for any loading rate cycle period can be determined by the formulas 15 u c y d r a m m e n u r u c y d r a m m e n 16 u c y d r a m m e n u r u c y d r a m m e n as an example the loading rate factor u r for different loading rate cycle period is shown in table 1 referring to the method of determining cyclic loading factor u c y for a particular clay recommended by det norske veritas dnv rp e302 2002 u c y of plate anchors in a particular clay can be determined based on u c y d r a m m e n for drammen clay the expression is as follows 17 u c y u c y d r a m m e n u c y 0 u c y 0 d r a m m e n 1 r a r s r a r s where u c y 0 d r a m m e n and u c y 0 is the global cyclic loading factor in r a r s 0 for drammen clay and particular clay respectively the rationality of the proposed formula for global cyclic loading factor u c y is verified by comparing predictions with model test data from cheng et al 2020 the behaviours of plate anchors subjected to combined average and cyclic loads in soft clays were investigated in the model test a static tensional load average load r a was first applied to the plate anchor and then a sinusoidal cyclic load with a peak value of r c y f was applied to the anchor in the load controlled mode during tests finally the failure of plate anchor occurred after loading n e q v cycles the cyclic loading frequency is 0 1 hz the normalized average load r a r s is 0 5 the details of the model test can be seen in the literature the predictions and test data of u c y for different n e q v are shown in fig 19 obviously it can be seen that the proposed formula can better predict the model test results than dnv formula which proves the rationality of the formula to a certain extent regrettably the number of test cases in the literature is very limited and there are few related model test data of plate anchor under cyclic loading in other existing literatures therefore more model tests with different combination of average and cyclic loads should be carried out in the next research work to further verify the rationality of the proposed formula for u c y 5 conclusions the bearing capacity of plate anchors under the combination of average and cyclic loads in normal consolidation clays with linearly increasing shear strength was investigated by performing finite element analysis the key conclusions can be summarized as follows the cyclic loading factor u c y is closely related to the normalized average shear stress τ a s u and the equivalent number of cycles n e q v this paper points out that the expression of u c y for drammen clay proposed by det norske veritas dnv rp e302 2002 can not reasonably predict the value corresponding to large equivalent number of cycles such as n e q v 1000 however the number of cycles due waves could even exceed 108 over the design lifetime of the offshore structure therefore a more reasonable expression is proposed to determine the cyclic loading factor in this paper in addition it is also unreasonable to use u c y for one soil element to determine the cyclic anchor resistance as suggested by det norske veritas when a plate anchor is subjected to the initial average load initial tensile load the average stress level for each soil element around the anchor is different and then the corresponding u c y for each soil element is also different hence a global cyclic loading factor u c y should be defined to replace the u c y to determine the cyclic anchor resistance finite element models for computing the anchor resistance are developed and validated by comparing with the existing research results the method to determine the global cyclic loading factor u c y by finite element analysis is suggested the u c y for any given normalized average loads r a r s and n e q v can be determined by performing a series of numerical simulations the cyclic anchor resistance r c y can be quite different for different n e q v at different r a r s the soil cyclic shear strength is greater than the static strength because of the higher loading rate however the long term cyclic loading will also lead to the degradation of soil strength therefore the loading rate dominates for the fewer cycles number but the cyclic degradation dominates for the larger cycles number as a result compared with the static anchor resistance the cyclic anchor resistance is larger for the fewer n e q v and smaller for larger n e q v long term cyclic loading will accelerate the soil flow and degrade the anchor resistance which should be paid attention over the design lifetime of the offshore structure the effects of the embedment depth and inclination angles on u c y are investigated by performing numerical simulations the related predictions indicate u c y decreases slightly with increasing the embedment depth or inclination angles for given n e q v however overall the embedment depth and inclination angles have no significant effects on u c y based on the average u c y for different embedment depth and inclination angles an expression of u c y associated with r a r s and n e q v are proposed which can provide some reference for the engineering design of the plate anchor under cyclic loads credit authorship contribution statement xinglei cheng conceptualization methodology

20451,the pile group foundation of sea crossing bridges has various structural forms and its wave force characteristics are complex in this study the morrison equation and the boundary element method were utilized to establish a calculation model for predicting the maximum wave forces on the pile group foundation with a square pile cap moreover hydrodynamic models of pile group foundations were designed according to the gravity similarity criterion on this basis the model test and analytical calculation were carried out to investigate the effect of pile spacings pile slopes conical slopes on the top of the pile cap and wave parameters on wave forces of pile group foundations in addition impact characteristics of waves on the foundation were also analyzed the results shown that larger pile spacings and pile slopes reduced the wave forces on the foundation but this relationship weakened with the rise of the water level the inclined pile could be regarded as a vertical pile for calculating wave forces at high water level the conical slope increased the water blocking area on the pile cap which led to the increase of wave forces on the foundation when the wave only acted on the pile group the wave forces on the single pile firstly decreased then increased with the increase of frequencies and lower wave frequencies larger periods induced stronger nonlinear factors of the waves when the water level was near the bottom of the pile cap larger wave periods increased the vertical wave forces on the pile cap the wave impact mainly occurred in the time range from the pile cap first contacting with the wave to the wave crest reaching the middle of the pile group foundation keywords pile group foundation wave force pile spacing pile slope conical slope wave impact 1 introduction pile group foundations are the most common foundation forms for sea crossing bridges on the one hand the pile group foundation transfers the load from the upper part of the bridge to the seabed on the other hand it also suffers from the harsh ocean environment for a long time it can be said that the pile group foundation is the most basic structure related to the structural safety of the whole sea crossing bridge the pile group foundation often extends from the sea level to the seabed soil thus it has the closest contact with the ocean which makes the pile group foundation permanently subject to the action of ocean wave loads the strength of ocean waves depends on the harsh degree of the ocean environment when the ocean environment is mild the pile group foundation is prone to damage under the combined action of long term wave impacts and seawater erosion which affects the durability of the structure bai et al 2018 dai et al 2021 li and zhang 2020 in addition harsh ocean conditions are often accompanied by the birth of extreme waves for a long time extreme waves caused by natural disasters lead to local damage or overall destruction of many sea crossing bridges resulting in serious economic losses and casualties for example extreme waves caused by hurricanes and earthquakes had destroyed a large number of coastal bridges akiyama et al 2013 kosa 2012 mas et al 2015 meng 2011 stearns and padgett 2012 therefore it is of great practical significance to study the wave force characteristics of pile group foundations under wave loads for predicting wave forces and improving the safety of bridges a pile group foundation is consisting of the pile group and a pile cap in which the pile group is a whole composed of several single piles arranged according to a certain pile spacing in terms of geometric scales the scale of the pile is often smaller but the scale of the pile cap is relatively larger which leads to a great difference of their wave forces in calculation methods for a single pile vertical or inclined its wave forces can be well calculated by the morrison equation meng et al 2018 morison et al 1950 wave forces of the pile group can be further predicted by considering the interference and shielding effects i e pile group effects between all single piles the pile spacing is less than four times the pile diameter bonakdar et al 2015 bonakdar and oumeraci 2015 gao et al 1987 li et al 1993 for the pile cap the wave diffraction effect must be considered and its wave forces can be calculated according to the linear diffraction theory berkhoff and weide 1978 havelock 1940 therefore wave forces of the pile group foundation are often simplified as the combination of wave forces of the pile group and a pile cap this simplified method had been applied to the wave force prediction of some ocean structures and good prediction results had been obtained geng et al 2010 jameel et al 2017 however this method also has disadvantages that is it cannot accurately simulate time history characteristics of wave forces and only the maximum wave force can be predicted under specific wave conditions chakrabarti and tam 1975 liu et al 2016 the reason is that wave forces of ocean structures such as the pile group foundation are very complex due to their special structural forms moreover wave forces of ocean structures are also easily affected by wave conditions for example some special dynamic behaviors such as impact action wave breaking and wave submerged the structure will occur under different wave conditions e g water level wave height wave period etc the existing simplified method is not enough to accurately simulate the interaction between waves and pile group foundations in terms of the interaction between waves and pile group foundations researchers had contributed critical research works taking the pile group foundation of east sea bridge as the prototype liu et al 2007 studied wave force properties of the single pile and the pile group the experimental results show that wave forces of an inclined pile with a small angle can be calculated according to the vertical pile however the influence of pile inclinations on the foundation wave forces is not clear and the effect of the pile cap on the foundation wave forces needs further discussion wei et al 2013 investigated the influence of the fluid structure interaction on modal dynamic responses of pile group foundations through model test and numerical simulation liu et al 2017 made the dynamic model of a pile group foundation according to the geometric scale of 1 100 and dynamic responses of piles and the pile cap was then studied under the single or combined action of earthquakes waves and currents the effect of the pile cap on wave forces of the pile group was investigated by deng et al 2019 at the same time they also analyzed the variation of the pile cap effect coefficient with wave heights wavelengths pile cap sizes and submergence depths wu and yang 2020 established a numerical model considering the interaction of earthquakes waves and ocean currents and analyzed wave force characteristics of the pile group however the wave force properties of the pile cap and the pile group foundation are lack of discussion xu et al 2020 studied the influence of the pile group clearance heights and wave heights on wave forces of an elevated pile cap through the model test and the time history characteristics of wave forces of the pile cap were explored under different wave conditions this research provides an important reference for revealing the interaction between the pile group and the pile cap it can be found that researches on the interaction between pile group foundations and waves are relatively less especially related experimental researches in addition the effect of the pile group and the pile cap on wave forces of the pile group foundation also needed further investigation the pile group foundation of sea crossing bridges in deep water often presents the following three characteristics in structural forms 1 the increase in water depth results in longer piles bridge engineering will continue to extend from inshore areas to the deep sea in the future at present china had planned to build sea crossing channels across qiongzhou strait lin et al 2016 bohai bay wu et al 2020 and taiwan strait shi et al 2003 it is predicted that the maximum water depth of the sea crossing bridge may exceed 100 m in the future song et al 2020 2 it is necessary to set inclined piles to resist huge horizontal forces in the pile group foundation for example pile group foundations of the east sea bridge and qinhuangdao dalian sea crossing bridge were equipped with inclined piles to resist horizontal forces liu et al 2007 wu and qiu 2020 3 the size of the pile cap is large and its shape is various there are various cross section forms of pile caps the most common shapes are round square and the combination of round and square also some pile caps have conical slopes on the top surface to reduce impact forces of floating objects on the sea for example to reduce impact loads of floating ices the top surface of the pile cap for confederation bridge in canada was set to be conical brown and määttänen 2009 and the top surface of some pile caps for hong kong zhuhai macao bridge was also set to be conical jing 2020 sun et al 2019 structural forms of pile group foundations for sea crossing bridges are various and different water depths pile spacings pile slopes pile inclination directions and structural forms of pile caps will have a greater influence on wave forces of pile group foundations which still needs to be investigated systematically this study aims to investigate the effect of structural forms of pile group foundations on its wave force characteristics and to analyze the evolution law of the wave impact behavior therefore an analytical model for predicting maximum wave forces of the pile group foundation with a square pile cap was established by utilizing the morrison equation and boundary element method in this work in addition according to the gravity similarity criterion eight hydrodynamic models of pile group foundations with different pile spacings and pile slopes were designed and made in which the geometric scale of models was 1 40 moreover we installed an inclined plate on the top surface of the model to simulate the conical slope on the top surface of the pile cap further through model test and analytical calculation the effect of different pile spacings pile slopes conical slopes and wave parameters on wave forces of pile group foundations were studied and the impact force properties of waves on the foundation were also analyzed 2 experimental set up 2 1 wave testing facilities the experiments were performed in a 40 m long 8 m wide and 1 m deep wave flume as shown in fig 1 in the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology one end of the flume was equipped with a hydraulic type wave generator which was designed by the dalian university of technology and could generate various one dimensional wave environments such as linear and nonlinear regular wave irregular wave focused wave etc the wave generator was equipped with a data acquisition system and controlled by a microcomputer system in the process of making waves the microcomputer system generated the driving signal of the wave generator according to the wave making file and the waves was then made through the motion of the wave generator the actual wave information collected by the data acquisition system in the water flume was fed back to the microcomputer system and the motion command of the wave generator was automatically iterated and corrected according to the feedback until the expected waves are made the wave absorbing beach which is made of porous polymer material was located at the other end of the flume to absorb wave energy and reduce wave reflection a movable steel truss bridge was installed on the upper part of the flume to fix observe and adjust the model during the experiment the steel truss bridge was located at the middle of the flume and the model was installed at the middle of the bridge the model was 20 m away from the front of the flume and 4 m away from both sides of the flume a wave gauge of the type dly 1 developed by the dalian university of technology was utilized to measure the elevation data of wave surface in this experiment before the test the wave gauge was calibrated and the calibration linearity was greater than 0 999 the wave gauge was installed at 1m away from the model and its sampling frequency was set to 100 hz that is sufficient to record the fluctuation of water surface in the following testing the cartesian coordinate of the water flume was defined as illustrated in fig 1 a and b x direction is the longitudinal direction from the wave generator to the wave absorbing beach y direction is the transverse direction and z direction is the vertical direction with positive direction upward the force moment sensor produced by the nitta company of japan was used to measure both force and torque acting on the model along x y and z directions the maximum measurement ranges of this sensor are respectively 100 n in horizontal direction 200 n in z direction and 11 n m in three directions previous experiments guo et al 2015 xu et al 2020 show that the sampling frequency of the sensor is set to 200hz which is sufficient to collect the impulsive forces and structural responses signals in this study we chosen 500hz which is higher than 200 hz as the sampling frequency of the sensor to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of the measurements during the test 2 2 design and installation of models in this study the pile group foundation was composed of a square pile cap and the pile group 2 2 arrangement and the gravity similarity criterion xu et al 2020 was used to guide the design of models this criterion indicates that the structural geometric dimension and the flow velocity at corresponding points should satisfy the following relationship in flow fields of the prototype and model 1 v p 2 l p g p v m 2 l m g m where v is the flow velocity the subscript p represents the prototype flow field and the subscript m expresses the model flow field l is the geometric dimension and g is the gravity acceleration generally gravity accelerations in two flow fields are equal i e g p g m the geometric scale λ l p l m according to eq 1 the flow velocity scale can be therefore expressed as λ v v p v m λ 1 2 further the time scale λ t λ λ v λ 1 2 the frequency scale λ f 1 λ t λ 1 2 and the force scale λ f λ ρ λ 2 λ v 2 λ ρ λ 3 λ ρ denotes the fluid density scale λ ρ 1 in this experiment it can be seen from the above calculation that once the geometric scale is determined the scales of other physical quantities can be calculated according to eq 1 for the geometric scale λ we expect that it can be set smaller to obtain better model test results in this investigation the geometric scale λ was selected as 40 in consideration of the experimental contents and the conditions of the experimental facilities the conversion relationship between geometric scale and other relevant physical scales could be therefore calculated and listed in table 1 the size of the square pile cap was 325 mm 325 mm 100 mm length width height the pile diameter d was 50 mm and the pile length was 500 mm as shown in fig 2 for the pile group the pile group effect cannot be ignored if s g 4d s g is the pile spacing which represents the distance between the centers of two piles bonakdar et al 2015 generally the pile spacing s g in bridges is less than 4d in order to study the influence of pile spacings s g four pile group models fig 2 a and b were designed with pile spacings of 1 5d 2d 2 5d and 3d respectively to investigate the effect of pile slopes s p the ratio of horizontal projection length l t to vertical projection length l v we designed four pile group models fig 2 c and d with pile slopes of 1 5 1 4 1 3 and 1 2 respectively in addition in order to analyze the influence of the conical slopes s c on the top of the pile cap we set an inclined plate on the top surface of the pile cap to simulate the conical slope and designed four kinds of conical slopes fig 2 e and f which were 1 1 1 25 1 1 75 1 and 2 25 1 respectively the model was made of plexiglass material which has the advantages of lightweight and high stiffness and has been widely used in the model test of hydraulic structures liu et al 2007 xu et al 2020 the thickness of plates and pipes used in the experiment was adopted as 5 mm to ensure the stiffness and strength of the model fig 3 shows the installation diagram of the model a steel truss beam was welded between the two steel truss bridges at the upper part of the flume to connect and fix the model and equipment below a movable device that can adjust up and down position was fixed under the steel truss beam the device was composed of two 10 mm thick plexiglass plates and eight bolts and the relative position of bolts and plexiglass plates was adjusted to realize the up and down movement of the whole model the force moment sensor was fixed under the movable device the sensor and the model were connected by a 15 cm high rigid connector which was welded by four 3 mm thick steel plates the rigid connector can avoid the contact between the sensor and water in the process of wave motion 2 3 test conditions the wave condition used in this experiment was the regular wave generally the wave height of several meters is the most common in the ocean environment and the period is usually 3 15s chakrabarti 2005 therefore combined with the similarity relationship listed in table 1 the wave height h of the test regular wave was set as 0 04 m 0 06 m 0 08 m and 0 1 m respectively and the wave period t was set as 1 s 1 3 s 1 6 s and 1 9 s respectively besides the pile cap of sea crossing bridges is often close to the sea lever in the low water level waves may only act on pile groups while at high water level the wave may submerge the pile cap consequently we designed three water depth conditions which were 0 47 m 0 53 m and 0 58 m respectively the relative position relationship between water depth d and model is described in fig 4 2 4 wave making test in order to test the performance of regular waves produced by the wave generator four groups of regular waves were randomly selected for wave making test in the flume the specific parameters of four groups of regular waves were listed in table 2 le mehaute 1976 used two dimensionless independent parameters h gt 2 and d gt 2 to clarify the applicability of various wave theories after that zhu 1983 analyzed a large number of measured data and theoretical calculation data considered that the calculation results of the 2nd order stokes wave theory were generally larger and suggested that the 5th order stokes wave theory was more suitable when t g d 1 2 10 it can be seen from table 2 that according to the research of le mehaute 1976 the 2nd order stokes wave theory is applicable to the four groups of regular waves listed in table 2 at the same time we also considered the suggestion of zhu 1983 and it is more appropriate to adopt the 5th order stokes wave theory in this experiment fig 5 presents the comparison between the measured wave surface motion and the theoretical solution of four groups of regular waves it can be found that the measured results are in good agreement with the theoretical solutions which indicates that the regular waves generated by the wave generator can satisfy the experimental requirements 2 5 modal analysis of foundation models if low order mode frequencies of a hydrodynamic model are similar to wave frequencies resonance will appear in the process of the experiment which makes the measured wave forces be amplified and seriously affects the experimental results wei et al 2017 xu et al 2020 moreover related studies zhang et al 2019 show that the first order modal frequency of a structure in the water will gradually decrease with the rise of the water level we therefore expect that the first order mode frequency of the model is much higher than frequencies of experimental waves to avoid the influence of the model natural frequency on the test results it is thus necessary to carry out the modal analysis on the plexiglass models of pile group foundations before the experiment the density elastic modulus and poisson s ratio of the plexiglass material used in the model are 1180 kg m3 2 94 gpa and 0 25 respectively according to the model size fig 2 material parameters and restraint conditions after the model was installed the finite element solid models of eight pile group foundations were established by using the ansys software version 14 0 and the modal analysis was carried out fig 6 presents the 1st order modal frequencies and shapes of all models the experimental results of guo et al 2015 and xu et al 2020 show that structural wave forces appear the characteristics of the multi peak in the frequency domain under the action of regular waves the frequency corresponding to the maximum peak is the wave frequency and the other peak frequencies are the multiples of the wave frequency in this study the maximum experimental wave frequency was 1 hz t 1 s and fig 7 plots the spectrum curves of wave forces for a pile group foundation model under the wave action at this frequency in fig 7 the wave forces of the model also present multi peak characteristics combined with fig 6 it can be found that the 1st order mode frequency of all models is greater than 20 hz while in fig 7 the amplitude of wave force is very small when f 5 hz which indicates that the natural vibration characteristics of all models have little influence on the test results in this investigation 3 calculation model of wave forces in this study the wave forces of the pile group foundation are considered as the combination of wave forces of the pile group and the pile cap for the pile group the dimension of a single pile is often relatively small d l 0 2 where d is diameter and l is wavelength therefore the wave force of a single pile can be solved by the morison equation and the wave force of the whole pile group can be further calculated by considering the pile group effect on the contrary the dimension of the pile cap is relatively large d l 0 2 the diffraction effect of the wave should be hence considered when calculating wave forces of the pile cap there is a top fixed pile group foundation in the finite water depth d the cartesian coordinate system was adopted to describe the position relationship of the model let the oxy plane be the top surface of the fluid the x direction is consistent with the wave propagation direction and the z direction point upwards moreover the centroid of the pile group foundation was set on the z axis we also assumed that the elevations at the bottom of the pile cap and the pile were h1 and h2 respectively then the calculation model of wave forces for the pile group foundation can be established as illustrated in fig 8 3 1 wave force calculation of the pile group because the small diameter cylinder in water has little influence on the wave motion it can be concluded that the wave forces of the small diameter cylinder are mainly caused by the viscous effect and the added mass effect morison et al 1950 the horizontal wave forces acting on the unit height of a vertical cylinder is calculated as follows 2 f x 1 2 c d d u x u x 1 4 c m ρ π d 2 a x where ρ is the water density c d and c m are the drag force coefficient and inertia force coefficient respectively and they are related to kc number reynolds number and surface roughness in this study c d 1 2 and c m 2 according to the research of sarpkaya 1977 u x and a x are the horizontal velocity and acceleration of the water particle at any height z on the axis of the cylinder for the 5th order stokes wave the expressions of u x and a x are as follows chakrabarti 2005 3 u x c n 1 5 n λ n cosh n k z d cos n k x cos θ y sin θ ω t 4 a x ω c n 1 5 n 2 λ n cosh n k z d sin n k x cos θ y sin θ ω t where c is wave velocity k is wave number d is water depth θ is the angle between incident wave and x axis ω is circular frequency the calculation of coefficient λ n can be referred to relevant literature zhu 1983 for an inclined cylinder the calculation formula of wave forces on the unit cylinder height can be expressed as follows 5 f 1 2 c d d u n u n 1 4 c m ρ π d 2 a n where f f x i f y j f z k u n u x i u y j u z k which is the velocity vector of the water particle orthogonal to the axis of the cylinder a n a x i a y j a z k which is the acceleration vector of the water particle orthogonal to the axis of the cylinder let the unit vector on the axis of the cylinder is e i e e e x i e y j e z k it can be then educed from fig 9 a that e x sin φ cos η e y sin φ sin η and e z cos φ if the velocity vector of the water particle is u then 6 u n e u e 7 a n u n t where u u x i u y j u z k since only unidirectional wave action is considered in this investigate u y 0 u x can be calculated by eq 3 and u z is expressed as follows chakrabarti 2005 8 u z c n 1 5 n λ n sinh n k z d sin n k x cos θ y sin θ ω t furthermore according to eq 6 eq 7 and fig 9 b it can be obtained that 9 u x u x e x e x u x e z u z u y e y e x u x e z u z u z u z e z e x u x e z u z u n u x 2 u z 2 e x u x e z u z 2 1 2 10 a x 1 e x 2 u x t e z e x u z t a y e x e y u x t e z e y u z t a z e x e z u x t 1 e z 2 u z t comparing eq 5 with eq 2 it can be found that the calculation formula of wave forces on a vertical cylinder is a special form of that on an inclined cylinder because the unit vector e of the vertical cylinder is k we can get eq 2 by substituting e k into eq 5 and the f y and f z are zero combined with fig 8 we can further calculate the wave forces on a single pile as follows 11 f i h 1 h 2 f d z where i is the pile number and f i is the wave force on the pile i for the pile group with s g 4d the pile group effect must be considered gao et al 1987 used the pile group coefficients which including interference coefficient k g and shielding coefficient k z to describe the interaction between the wave forces on every single pile in the pile group specifically the interference coefficient k g was utilized to describe the interaction of wave forces between side by side piles and the shielding coefficient k z was used to describe the shielding effect of the front pile on the back pile in tandem piles the two coefficients are the ratio of wave force that is f group f single where f group is the wave forces on a single pile in the pile group under wave loads f single is the wave forces on only a single vertical pile under the same wave loads gao et al 1987 considered that the ratio s d s d s g d 1 in fig 8 had the greatest influence on the pile group coefficients and the estimation formulas of the two coefficients were determined through experiments the formulas are as follows 12 k g 1 265 0 225 ln s d 13 k z 0 836 0 141 ln s d in the subsequent related studies li et al 1993 researchers found that kc number also had a great influence on pile group coefficients after that through a large number of model tests bonakdar et al 2015 redefined the estimation formulas of two coefficients by considering the influence of kc number and s d the estimation formulas are as follows 14 k g 1 14 s d 0 19 s d 1 5 a n d k c 6 0 87 s d 0 51 k c 0 26 s d 1 5 a n d 6 k c 13 1 4 s d 0 46 e 52 7 k c 2 22 s d 1 5 a n d k c 13 1 1 1 5 s d 2 1 s d 2 15 k z 1 0 074 s d 0 8 e k c 56 s d 3 1 s d 3 in addition the china standard named code of hydrology for harbor and waterway jts 145 2015 fang et al 2016 corrected a large number of experimental and field measured data and proposed the pile group coefficients suitable for engineering structures as shown in table 3 in table 3 only the pile group coefficients under three s g d conditions are listed for other s g d conditions the coefficients can be selected by the method of linear interpolation comparing with eq 12 eq 15 and table 3 it can be found that when the s g d is the same the pile group coefficients recommended in table 3 are the largest followed by the estimated value of eq 12 eq 13 and the estimated value of eq 14 eq 15 is the smallest which is related to the estimation method of pile group coefficients eq 12 eq 15 are derived only from the experimental data while the coefficients in table 3 are determined after correcting the experimental data and the field measured data which makes the coefficients in table 3 more suitable to apply in the engineering calculation method for wave forces of the single pile i e morrison equation in addition considering the influence of kc number in the test also make pile group coefficients smaller eq 14 eq 15 then the wave forces of the pile group can be calculated according to the following formula 16 f i 1 m k g k z f i where m is the number of piles 3 2 boundary element method for calculating wave forces on the rectangular pile cap 3 2 1 governing equations and boundary conditions the research of chakrabarti and tam 1975 shows that when 2a d 0 25 and 0 kd 2 3 where a is the wave amplitude the action of waves on large scale structures can be regarded as the diffraction problem of linear potential waves on structures in this study all the waves meet the above conditions therefore the action of waves on the pile cap can be considered as the diffraction problem of linear potential waves on the pile cap in that way the total wave velocity potential φ x y z t is the superposition of incident potential φ i x y z t and diffraction potential φ d x y z t the expression is as follows 17a φ x y z t φ i x y z t φ d x y z t the time variable t is further separated and the eq 17a is transformed into 17b ψ x y z e i ω t ψ i x y z e i ω t ψ d x y z e i ω t where i 1 the spatial variables x and y of the linear incident potential ψ i x y z in the eq 17b can be also separated ψ i x y z is then rewritten as 18a ψ i x y z i g ω h 2 cosh k z d cosh k d e i k x cos θ y sin θ where g is the acceleration of gravity we define ϕ i x y e ik xcosθ ysinθ eq 18a can be thus transformed into 18b ψ i x y z i g ω h 2 cosh k z d cosh k d ϕ i x y the diffraction potential ψ d x y z should have the same mathematical expression as the incident potential ψ i x y z then 19 ψ d x y z i g ω h 2 cosh k z d cosh k d ϕ d x y at the same time the diffraction potential ψ d x y z should also satisfy the laplace equation and some corresponding boundary conditions 20a 2 ψ d 0 in the domain 20b ψ d z ω 2 g ψ d 0 on the free surface 20c ψ d n ψ i n on the structural surface 20d ψ d n 0 on the sea bed 20e l i m r r ψ d r i k ψ d 0 at infinity where r 2 x 2 y 2 z 2 by substituting eq 19 into eq 20a eq 20e the governing equations and corresponding boundary conditions only related to the unknown diffraction potential ϕ d x y can be obtained 21a 2 ϕ d k 2 ϕ d 0 in the domain 21b ϕ d n ϕ i n on the structural surface 21c l i m r r ϕ d r i k ϕ d 0 at infinity where r 2 x 2 y 2 it can be found that the three dimensional boundary value problem eq 20a eq 20e is transformed into the two dimensional boundary value problem eq 21a eq 21c for the structure with constant cross section along the z direction we can first solve the two dimensional diffraction potential ϕ d x y and then calculate the three dimensional diffraction potential ψ d x y z by using the integral method furthermore by superposition of the three dimensional diffraction potential ψ d x y z and the three dimensional incident potential ψ i x y z we can obtain the total velocity potential φ x y z in the wave field finally the total velocity potential φ x y z can be used to calculate the wave forces on the pile cap 3 2 2 boundary integral equation and its discrete form eq 21a is helmholtz equation and the fundamental solution g of helmholtz equation is presented in eq 22 22 g i 4 h 0 1 k r p q where h 0 1 x denotes the hankel function of the first kind k is the wave number p and q are any two points in the domain their coordinates are x y and ξ η respectively r pq 2 x ξ 2 y η 2 then the fundamental solution g satisfies the helmholtz equation shown in eq 23 23 2 g k 2 g δ m n 0 where δ is a two dimensional dirac delta function the two dimensional boundary value problem represented by eq 21a eq 21c is a helmholtz equation problem in two connected domains as shown in fig 10 a the boundary integral equation of this problem is as follows kim et al 2007 24 c ϕ d γ c γ g ϕ d n d γ γ c γ ϕ d g n d γ where c is a constant related to the boundary geometry at point p as described in fig 10 b the calculation formula of constant c is as follows 25 c p α p 2 π kim et al 2007 deduced that the integral term on the right side of eq 24 is equal to zero on the infinite boundary γ by using the radiation boundary condition eq 21c further by substituting the boundary condition eq 21b into eq 24 the boundary integral equation is obtained as follows 26a c ϕ d γ c ϕ d g n d γ γ c g ϕ i n d γ for rectangular boundaries as shown in fig 10 c the discrete form of eq 26a can be written as follows 26b c p ϕ d p q 1 n γ c g n d γ ϕ d q q 1 n γ c g d γ ϕ i q n where m is the number of elements on the rectangular boundary if point p is located at the four corner points a b c d illustrated in fig 10 c c p 0 75 when point p is located at other positions on the square boundary c p 0 5 eq 26b can also be written in matrix form shown in eq 26c 26c a ϕ bq where a and b are matrices of order m m and the calculation of their elements is presented in eq 27 and eq 28 ϕ is the matrix of order m 1 which is composed of m two dimensional diffraction potentials ϕ d q is the matrix of order m 1 which is composed of the normal derivatives of m two dimensional incident potentials ϕ i the calculation expression of q is described in eq 29 27 a p q c p q a p q γ q g n d γ q p q 28 b p q 1 2 π 1 γ ln k δ l

of g on element q in this study the gauss integral formula is used to solve the above two kinds of integrals gaul et al 2003 3 2 3 calculation of wave forces the distribution of wave pressures acting on the surface of the pile cap is as follows 30 p ρ φ t substituting eq 17 eq 19 into eq 30 we can derive the following equation 31 p ρ g h 2 cosh k z d cosh k d ϕ i ϕ d e i ω t combined with figs 9 and 10 the horizontal wave forces of the square pile cap can be calculated as follows 32 f x re ρ g h 2 cosh k d 0 h 1 cosh k z d d z γ c ϕ i ϕ d n x d γ e i ω t 33 f y re ρ g h 2 cosh k d 0 h 1 cosh

that is n x cos n x n y cos n y 3 2 4 modelling and validation wave forces on a rectangular pile cap xu et al 2020 measured the wave forces of a square pile cap under different regular wave conditions this study takes this as an example to describe and verify the application of boundary element method in the calculation of wave forces for a rectangular pile cap the top fixed cap specimen is located in the water with a depth of 0 9 m the dimension of the cap specimen is a rigid box with length of 0 4 m width of 0 267 m and height of 0 15 m the wave direction is consistent with the x axis and is perpendicular to the long side of the pile cap the still water level is higher than the bottom of the pile cap and the distance between them is 0 075 m which is half the height of the pile cap we assume that the oxy plane be the still water surface the z direction point upwards and the centroid of the cap specimen is on the z axis then the calculation model of wave forces for the square pile cap can be established as illustrated in fig 11 a fig 11 b shows the pseudo code of the calculation of wave forces on the pile cap and describes the calculation process overall the calculation process can be divided into the following parts firstly the parameters related to waves including wave height h period t water depth d water density ρ and acceleration of gravity g were input into the calculation program the wavelength l and wave number k were then solved according to the linear dispersion relation which can be expressed as follows 34 l g t 2 2 π tanh k d where k 2π l eq 34 can be solved by iterative method in this investigation the initial wavelength l 0 g t 2 2 π and the convergence accuracy ε was determined as 0 0001 the rectangular boundary г c on the oxy plane was discretized into m elements and the coordinates x q y q of the element nodes were then calculated this study selects the constant element to simulate the boundary and the element length δl was set to 1 mm the whole boundary was therefore divided into 1334 elements i e m 1334 it should be noted that the four corner points of the rectangular boundary were defined as the start or end points of an element to ensure that each element is continuous on the boundary thus the constant c in boundary integral equation eq 26a is equal to 0 5 for this example because the field point p and the source point q are located on the boundary the matrix a and b which related to two points could be calculated according to eqs 27 and 28 respectively at the same time the matrix q could be solved by utilizing eq 29 the matrix of diffraction potentials at each element node could be further obtained by the following formula 35 ϕ a 1 bq where the matrix ϕ contains the diffraction potentials of all element nodes on the boundary i e ϕ d x q y q after that the incident potentials at all element nodes were calculated by using eq 18 i e ϕ i x q y q finally by superposing the diffraction potential ϕ d and the incident potential ϕ i and utilizing eqs 32 and 33 the wave forces of the pile cap can be obtained because the incident direction of waves is consistent with the x direction in this example the wave forces in y direction is zero i e f y 0 the measured maximum horizontal wave forces under four different wave conditions were compared with the calculation results of the presented method which are listed in table 4 it can be seen from table 4 that the calculation results of the presented method match well with the measured results which shows that the calculation model of wave forces for the square pile cap presented in this paper is correct and the solution for the diffraction problem of the square pile cap has high accuracy 4 results and discussions 4 1 influence of pile spacings fig 12 shows the influence of pile spacings on the wave forces of the foundation under different water level conditions in which the wave height is 0 06 m and the period is 1 3 s when the water depth d 0 47 m the waves only act on the pile group at this time the maximum wave force of the foundation is shown in fig 12 a and b it can be seen that the horizontal wave forces and vertical wave forces decrease with the increase of pile spacings for the results calculated with the proposed method the horizontal wave forces with three different pile group coefficients also show a nearly linear decreasing trend with the increase of pile spacings which is consistent with the experimental results however the maximum wave forces calculated according to different pile group coefficients have a relatively large deviation the maximum deviation reaches 13 881 when the coefficients in jts 145 2015 and the formula proposed by gao et al 1987 are used to calculate wave forces of the pile group s g 1 5d in general the horizontal wave forces calculated according to jts 145 2015 table 3 is the largest followed by the formula proposed by gao et al 1987 and the horizontal wave forces calculated according to eq 14 and eq 15 is the smallest which is mainly caused by the different values of pile group coefficients in fig 12 a the maximum wave forces calculated according to the pile group coefficients in jts 145 2015 are similar to the experimental results and the former is larger than the latter in most pile spacing conditions in engineering design we expect that the predicted wave forces are greater than the measured wave forces and the difference between them is not significant therefore compared with other calculation methods of pile group coefficients jts 145 2015 is more suitable for engineering design also compared with eq 12 eq 15 and table 3 it can be found that the pile group coefficients estimated by eq 12 eq 15 are more suitable for predicting the wave forces of the pile group on a premise which is knowing measured data of wave forces on a single pile while the pile group coefficients recommended by jts 145 2015 table 3 are more suitable for predicting the wave forces of the pile group by using the morrison equation it should be noted that the pile group coefficients recommended by jts 145 2015 are adopted for the calculation of wave forces on the foundation under all subsequent wave conditions in this study when the water depth d 0 53 m the water level slightly exceeds the bottom of the pile cap fig 4 and the wave interacts with the foundation composed of the pile group and a small part of the pile cap we added an experiment for measuring wave forces on an isolated pile cap without piles in this water depth fig 12 c and d present the maximum wave forces of the foundation it can be seen that the horizontal and vertical wave forces decrease with the increase of pile spacings but the decrease rate of wave forces is slower than that of d 0 47 m the reason is that the wave forces on the pile cap account for a relatively large part of the wave forces on the foundation especially for vertical wave forces shown in fig 12 d the maximum vertical wave forces on the pile cap accounts for 98 259 of that on the pile group foundation when s g 3d the proportion of the maximum horizontal wave forces of the pile cap on that of the foundation is relatively reduced nevertheless the proportion also reached 74 888 when s g 3d in fig 12 c this demonstrates that as long as the pile cap participates in the interaction between waves and the foundation the effect of pile spacings will be weakened on the other hand it is also illustrated that the pile spacings have a significant influence on the wave forces of the pile group but it is not obvious for the pile cap in addition compared with the isolated pile cap without piles fig 12 c and d indicate that even if only a small part of the pile cap participates in the wave interaction the wave forces on the pile cap cannot be ignored and the existence of the pile cap significantly increases the overall wave forces of the pile group foundation in fig 12 c the measured maximum horizontal wave forces are in good agreement with the calculation results the maximum deviation is 7 445 when s g 1 5d which indicates that the presented method is correct and can be applied to the prediction of horizontal wave force on the pile group foundation when the water depth d 0 58 m the water level is located at the middle of the pile cap and the wave acts on a large part of the pile cap fig 12 e shows the typical time history curves of horizontal wave forces and corresponding maximum wave forces on the foundation it can be found that the four horizontal wave force curves almost coincide indicating that the pile spacing has little influence on the overall wave forces of the foundation under this water level in addition the maximum horizontal wave forces decrease slowly with the increase of pile spacings which illustrates that the wave forces of the pile cap account for a large part of the wave forces on the foundation fig 12 f presents the maximum vertical wave forces of the foundation the vertical wave forces decrease with the increase of pile spacings moreover compared with fig 12 b the vertical wave forces decrease more slowly when d 0 58 m 4 2 influence of pile slopes to investigate the effect of pile slopes four models of the pile group foundation are designed based on the foundation model of vertical pile group with the pile spacing s g 2d the pile slopes s p are 1 5 1 4 1 3 and 1 2 and the corresponding inclination angles the angle between pile axis and z axis are 11 31 14 036 18 435 and 26 565 respectively in addition we also studied the influence of two different wave motion directions in the experiment one is that the direction of the pile inclination is consistent with the wave motion direction i e case 1 and the other is that the direction of the pile inclination is perpendicular to the wave motion direction i e case 2 fig 13 shows the comparison results between the measured values and the calculated solutions of the maximum wave forces of foundation models under different water depths among them two kinds of calculation results are presented namely considering pile group effect and ignoring pile group effect besides the wave forces of the vertical pile group foundation are also plotted in fig 13 as a comparison condition the wave height is 0 06 m and the period is 1 3 s in this test fig 13 a and b show the maximum horizontal and vertical wave forces of the foundation at water depth d 0 47 m respectively at this moment the wave only acts on the pile group both the measured and calculated results illustrate that the increase of pile slopes reduces the wave forces of the pile group foundation moreover when the wave motion direction is perpendicular to the direction of the pile inclination i e case 2 the decreasing speed of wave forces is more significant the reason is that the pile group effect is weakened or the pile spacing is increased to some extent when the pile group tilts outward because the inclination direction of piles in case 1 is the same as the direction of the wave motion increasing the pile slope has little influence on the spacing of side by side piles but it increases the spacing of tandem piles which will weaken the shielding effect of the pile group case 2 is opposite to case 1 in case 2 the inclination direction of piles is perpendicular to the direction of the wave motion therefore the increase of the pile slope will weaken the interference effect but has little effect on the shielding effect in fig 13 a with the increase of the pile slope the measured values in case 1 are more inclined to the calculation results considering the pile group effect while the measured values in case 2 are gradually consistent with the calculation results neglecting the pile group effect fig 13 b also shows that the maximum vertical wave forces in case 1 are larger than that in case 2 all these indicate that the influence of the interference effect on the wave forces of the pile group is greater than that of the shielding effect on the wave forces of the pile group under the same conditions the maximum difference for transverse wave forces between case 1 and case 2 is 18 309 when s p 1 3 while the maximum deviation for vertical wave forces increases to 28 302 when s p 1 2 this illustrate that the inclination direction of piles has more influence on the vertical wave forces of the pile group fig 13 c and d present the maximum wave forces of the foundation when d 0 53 m and a small part of the pile cap participates in the wave action at this time it can be found that the wave forces on the foundation present a gradually decreasing trend with the increase of pile slope compared with fig 13 a and b the reduction rate of the maximum wave forces slows down at the same time the maximum difference for horizontal wave forces between case 1 and case 2 is 9 522 when s p 1 2 under the same conditions however the maximum vertical wave forces in case1 and case2 are similar in all pile slope conditions and the maximum deviation for vertical wave forces is 2 255 when s p 1 5 this is quite different from the result of d 0 47 m and explains that the influence of the pile group effect on the wave forces of the foundation is significantly weakened due to the pile cap participating in the wave action when d 0 58 m the maximum wave forces of the pile group foundation are shown in fig 13 e and f at this moment a large part of the pile cap participates in the wave action it can be seen that the maximum wave forces in all conditions have little difference and the wave forces change little with the increase of pile slopes which indicates that the wave forces on the pile group foundation is controlled by the wave force of the pile cap and the pile slope is no longer an important influence factor therefore when designing the pile group foundation of sea crossing bridges the inclined piles can be regarded as the vertical piles when calculating the wave forces of the foundation with inclined piles at high water level which is far higher than the bottom elevation of the pile cap 4 3 influence of conical slopes in this experiment the conical slopes s c on the top of the pile cap are 1 1 1 25 1 1 75 1 and 2 25 1 respectively in addition the foundation without conical slope i e s c 0 is also analyzed as a contrast condition the wave height is 0 1 m the period is 1 3 s and the water depth is 0 58 m in this test the amplitude spectrums of the wave forces on the foundation are shown in fig 14 and fig 15 presents the instantaneous position of waves at four typical moments fig 15 a1 fig 15 a4 in fig 14 the amplitude spectrums of wave forces show multi peak characteristics and the peak frequency is a multiple of the wave frequency the wave force corresponding to the maximum peak is generated by the wave action while the other peak wave forces are mainly caused by the wave nonlinearity and the high order velocity potential from the incident and diffracted waves guo et al 2015 there are two obvious peaks in fig 14 a among them the first peak increases with the increase of the conical slopes the horizontal wave forces increase by 8 962 when s c 2 25 1 which indicates that the existence of the conical slope will increase the horizontal wave forces of the foundation however there is little difference in the second peak under all s c conditions which is consistent with the actual situation because the wave parameters such as period wave height water depth etc are the same under all s c conditions that is the wave nonlinear factors are the same the second peak will not change significantly in fig 14 b only the peak value of vertical wave forces corresponding to wave frequency is the most obvious and the peak wave force also increases with the increase of conical slopes compared with s c 0 the vertical wave forces increase by 13 766 when s c 2 25 1 it can be seen from fig 15 that when the wave reaches the left side of the pile cap fig 15 a1 fig 15 f1 the water surface is slightly deformed due to the influence of the previous wave when the wave continues to move forward until the crest reaches the left side of the pile cap fig 15 a2 fig 15 f2 the wave runs up along the pile cap in this process because the height of the wave crest exceeds the top elevation of the pile cap for the case s c 0 fig 15 b2 the wave directly submerged the pile cap however for the other cases fig 15 b2 fig 15 f2 the wave continues to climb up along the slope on the top of the pile cap in this process the horizontal wave force will increase to the maximum as the wave continues to move forward the wave will gradually fall along the slope and the left side of the pile cap by comparing fig 15 b2 fig 15 f2 it can be seen that the existence of the slope on the top of the pile cap significantly increases the water blocking area of the pile cap at the same time the increase of the slope leads to the enhancement of the interaction between the pile cap and waves the wave forces of the pile group foundation are therefore increased for the engineering design of the pile cap of sea crossing bridges it is suggested not to set the slope on the top of the pile cap as far as possible which can reduce the wave forces of the foundation and save the construction cost 4 4 influence of wave parameters the wave forces of the pile group foundation under different wave parameters are shown in fig 16 when d 0 47 m fig 16 a and b present the amplitude spectrums of the wave forces on the foundation under the same wave height h 0 04 m and different periods it can be found that the first peak values of horizontal and vertical wave force decrease with the increase of the period while the second peak values increase with the increase of the period fig 16 c and d summarize the first and second peaks of the wave forces on the foundation under different wave heights and periods it can be seen that under the same wave height condition the first peak wave forces decrease gradually with the increase of the period while the second peak wave forces increase with the increase of the period which indicates that the wave period or the wave frequency is an important factor affecting the wave forces of the pile group foundation in addition fig 16 also shows that the nonlinear influence of waves increases with the increase of the period the second peak value compared with the first peak wave forces the second peak wave forces are smaller this indicates that the wave forces of the foundation are weakly affected by the wave nonlinear factors and the wave forces of the pile group foundation are mainly provided by the first peak wave forces fig 16 c and d also present that under the same period conditions the increase of the wave height can significantly increase the wave forces of the foundation because the wave energy is proportional to the square of the wave height h the wave with larger wave height will have more energy acting on the foundation in unit time which leads to the increase of the wave forces on the pile group foundation because the experimental wave frequencies are limited only four wave frequencies in this investigation the experimental results cannot represent the wave force characteristics of the pile group in a wide frequency band therefore based on the experimental model and wave conditions we calculated the wave forces on a single pile by utilizing morrison equation eq 2 in the wide wave band and further discussed the influence of wave frequencies or wave periods on the wave forces of the single pile it should be noted that the wave forces of the pile group are obtained by superposition of wave forces on multiple single piles the wave forces on a vertical pile are therefore studied in this study to illustrate the wave force characteristics of the pile group morrison equation eq 2 shows that the wave force f p on a small diameter cylinder consists of two parts the drag force f d which is proportional to the square of the velocity of the water particle and the inertial force f m which is proportional to the acceleration of the water particle the variation of three wave forces f p f d and f m with wave frequencies is shown in fig 17 in fig 17 with the increase of wave frequencies the three wave forces show different changes the maximum wave forces f p on the single pile firstly decrease then increase the drag forces f d gradually decrease and the inertia force f m presents an increasing trend under a single wave frequency the maximum wave force on the single pile is not the algebraic sum of the maximum values of the drag force and the inertia force which is caused by the phase difference between the drag force and the inertia force in the case of low frequencies long period surge wave the proportion of the drag forces and the inertia forces in the wave forces on the single pile is little difference but the wave forces of the single pile are mainly provided by the inertia forces at high frequencies it can also be seen from fig 17 that the wave height has a significant effect on the three wave forces especially for the drag forces at low frequencies which increase sharply with the increase of the wave height in addition the four periods in the experiment are also shown in fig 17 it is found that the wave forces on the single pile decrease with the increase of the period which is consistent with the variation of the first peak in the experimental results when the water depth increases to 0 53 m a small part of the pile cap also participates in the wave action fig 18 a and b display the time history curves of wave forces on the foundation at four periods when h 0 04 m the time history curves of wave forces on the foundation at four periods when h 0 1 m are shown in fig 18 c and d in fig 18 a and b the deviation between the positive wave forces and the negative wave forces is relatively small and the curve has a comparatively smooth waveform however in fig 18 c and d the positive wave forces are significantly greater than the negative wave forces under all period conditions and the curve waveform is rough which reflects strong wave impact characteristics this indicates that when the water level is near the bottom of the pile cap the greater wave height induces the stronger wave impact on the pile cap in addition it can also be seen that with the increase of the wave period the horizontal wave forces of the foundation decrease gradually but the vertical wave forces show the increasing trend fig 18 e compares the wave force spectrums of the pile group foundation and the isolated pile cap under the same wave condition h 0 06 m t 1 3 s it is found that their vertical wave forces are almost the same while the horizontal wave forces of the pile group foundation are significantly greater than that of the isolated pile cap this illustrates that the vertical wave forces of the pile group foundation are mainly provided by the wave forces of the pile cap but for the horizontal wave forces on the pile group foundation the proportion of the pile group and the pile cap cannot be ignored therefore combined with figs 16 d 18 b and 18 d and 18 e it can be found that the decrease of wave frequencies period increase in unit time reduces the horizontal wave forces of the pile group foundation but also increases the vertical wave force of the pile cap fig 18 f compares the first and second peaks of vertical wave forces of the foundation under different wave heights and periods when the wave heights are the same the wave forces of the first peak increase gradually with the increase of the period while the wave forces of the second peak corresponding to most of the period conditions do not change significantly this shows that the larger the wave period induces the greater vertical wave forces on the foundation however the influence of wave nonlinearity on the vertical wave forces of the foundation is not obvious besides the increase of the wave height can significantly increase the vertical wave forces of the foundation under the same period 4 5 impact actions of waves on the pile group foundation if the water level is close to the bottom of the pile cap and the wave height is large the interaction between waves and the pile group foundation will show strong impact characteristics fig 19 a presents the evolution process of wave forces on the foundation in one wave period the wave height of the test wave is 0 1 m the period is 1 3 s and the water depth is 0 53 m fig 19 a also displays the time history curves of wave surface elevation at the wave facing side on the pile cap i e the left side of the pile cap in fig 19 b1 which is marked by a green arrow it can be seen from fig 19 that when the wave surface elevation at the wave facing side of the pile cap is the same as the static water level i e η 0 fig 19 b1 the wave begins to interact with the pile cap which is also the beginning for the impact of the wave on the pile group foundation with the wave continues to move forward the contact area between the wave and the bottom of the pile cap increases gradually at this time the water particles in the contact area move towards the upper right in the x z plane which leads to a rapid increase for the wave forces f x and f z on the foundation in this process in fig 19 a the first peak of wave force curves when the wave propagates forward to the position of the pile group the wave forces of the foundation decrease sharply due to the blocking effect of the pile group after the wave submerges the pile group the contact area between the wave and the bottom of the pile cap continues to increase until it is in full contact with the bottom of the pile cap fig 16 b2 and the vertical wave force f z of the foundation increases sharply in this process when the wave crest reaches the wave facing side of the pile cap fig 19 b3 the horizontal wave force f x on the foundation reaches the maximum after that when the wave crest reaches the middle of the pile cap fig 19 b4 the uplift force i e f z on the foundation reaches the maximum moreover because the water pressure on the left and right sides of the pile cap is similar and their direction is opposite the horizontal wave forces of the pile cap is close to zero at this time fig 19 b4 with the wave continues to move forward the wave gradually separates from the bottom of the pile cap at this time the water particles in the contact area move to the lower left in the x z plane which causes the wave forces f x and f z on the foundation to decrease gradually in this process and the horizontal wave force of the foundation reaches the negative maximum value at the time as shown in fig 19 b5 after the wave is completely separated from the pile cap the wave only interacts with the pile group when the wave trough reaches the middle of the foundation fig 19 b6 the vertical wave force of the pile group foundation reaches the negative maximum it can also be found from fig 19 a that the wave forces of the foundation fluctuate strongly in the time interval b1 b4 in one wave period which indicates that the wave impact mainly occurs in the time range from the pile cap first contacting with the wave b1 to the wave crest reaching the middle of the foundation b4 5 conclusions this paper presents a calculation model to predict the maximum wave forces of the pile group foundation and carries out the model experiment of the pile group foundation for sea crossing bridge based on this the effects of pile spacings pile slopes conical slopes and wave parameters on wave forces of the pile group foundation were studied moreover the impact process of waves on the pile group foundation was also investigated the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 larger pile spacings reduce the wave forces on the foundation when the wave only acts on the pile group change in pile spacings has a significant influence on the wave forces of the foundation but when the water level is close to or higher than the bottom elevation of the pile cap the effect of pile spacings is greatly weakened as long as the pile cap participates in the interaction between waves and the foundation the wave forces on the pile cap account for a relatively large part of the wave forces on the foundation 2 the increase of the pile slope reduces the wave forces on the foundation but higher water level weakens the effect of the pile slope the change in the pile slope is essentially the variation of the pile group spacing and it can be considered that larger pile slopes are equivalent to larger pile spacings when the direction of the pile inclination is the same as that of wave motion the pile slope mainly affects the shielding effect of tandem piles but the interference effect of side by side piles is mainly changed when the direction of the pile inclination is perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation furthermore the inclined pile can be regarded as the vertical pile when calculating the wave forces of the pile group foundation with inclined pile at high water level the conical slope increases the water blocking area on the pile cap which leads to the increase of wave forces on the foundation 3 when the wave only acts on the pile group the wave forces on the single pile firstly decrease then increase with the increase of frequencies and lower wave frequencies larger periods induce stronger nonlinear factors of the waves when the water level is near the bottom of the pile cap the increase of wave heights enhances the impact of waves on the foundation because the pile cap participates in the interaction between the waves and the foundation in this water level larger wave periods increase the vertical wave forces on the pile cap the wave impact mainly occurs in the time range from the pile cap first contacting with the wave to the wave crest reaching the middle of the foundation when the wave crest reaches the wave facing side of the pile cap the horizontal wave force of the pile group foundation is the largest and the maximum vertical wave forces occur when the wave crest reaches the middle of the pile cap it should be noted that the conclusions are drawn based on some assumptions the waves used in the experiment are unidirectional regular waves while the multi directional irregular waves are more in line with the reality therefore the multi directional irregular wave is worthy to be investigated systematically to attain some more generalizable results and it is meaningful to compare the results of regular waves with that of irregular waves credit authorship contribution statement zhenguo wang

20451,the pile group foundation of sea crossing bridges has various structural forms and its wave force characteristics are complex in this study the morrison equation and the boundary element method were utilized to establish a calculation model for predicting the maximum wave forces on the pile group foundation with a square pile cap moreover hydrodynamic models of pile group foundations were designed according to the gravity similarity criterion on this basis the model test and analytical calculation were carried out to investigate the effect of pile spacings pile slopes conical slopes on the top of the pile cap and wave parameters on wave forces of pile group foundations in addition impact characteristics of waves on the foundation were also analyzed the results shown that larger pile spacings and pile slopes reduced the wave forces on the foundation but this relationship weakened with the rise of the water level the inclined pile could be regarded as a vertical pile for calculating wave forces at high water level the conical slope increased the water blocking area on the pile cap which led to the increase of wave forces on the foundation when the wave only acted on the pile group the wave forces on the single pile firstly decreased then increased with the increase of frequencies and lower wave frequencies larger periods induced stronger nonlinear factors of the waves when the water level was near the bottom of the pile cap larger wave periods increased the vertical wave forces on the pile cap the wave impact mainly occurred in the time range from the pile cap first contacting with the wave to the wave crest reaching the middle of the pile group foundation keywords pile group foundation wave force pile spacing pile slope conical slope wave impact 1 introduction pile group foundations are the most common foundation forms for sea crossing bridges on the one hand the pile group foundation transfers the load from the upper part of the bridge to the seabed on the other hand it also suffers from the harsh ocean environment for a long time it can be said that the pile group foundation is the most basic structure related to the structural safety of the whole sea crossing bridge the pile group foundation often extends from the sea level to the seabed soil thus it has the closest contact with the ocean which makes the pile group foundation permanently subject to the action of ocean wave loads the strength of ocean waves depends on the harsh degree of the ocean environment when the ocean environment is mild the pile group foundation is prone to damage under the combined action of long term wave impacts and seawater erosion which affects the durability of the structure bai et al 2018 dai et al 2021 li and zhang 2020 in addition harsh ocean conditions are often accompanied by the birth of extreme waves for a long time extreme waves caused by natural disasters lead to local damage or overall destruction of many sea crossing bridges resulting in serious economic losses and casualties for example extreme waves caused by hurricanes and earthquakes had destroyed a large number of coastal bridges akiyama et al 2013 kosa 2012 mas et al 2015 meng 2011 stearns and padgett 2012 therefore it is of great practical significance to study the wave force characteristics of pile group foundations under wave loads for predicting wave forces and improving the safety of bridges a pile group foundation is consisting of the pile group and a pile cap in which the pile group is a whole composed of several single piles arranged according to a certain pile spacing in terms of geometric scales the scale of the pile is often smaller but the scale of the pile cap is relatively larger which leads to a great difference of their wave forces in calculation methods for a single pile vertical or inclined its wave forces can be well calculated by the morrison equation meng et al 2018 morison et al 1950 wave forces of the pile group can be further predicted by considering the interference and shielding effects i e pile group effects between all single piles the pile spacing is less than four times the pile diameter bonakdar et al 2015 bonakdar and oumeraci 2015 gao et al 1987 li et al 1993 for the pile cap the wave diffraction effect must be considered and its wave forces can be calculated according to the linear diffraction theory berkhoff and weide 1978 havelock 1940 therefore wave forces of the pile group foundation are often simplified as the combination of wave forces of the pile group and a pile cap this simplified method had been applied to the wave force prediction of some ocean structures and good prediction results had been obtained geng et al 2010 jameel et al 2017 however this method also has disadvantages that is it cannot accurately simulate time history characteristics of wave forces and only the maximum wave force can be predicted under specific wave conditions chakrabarti and tam 1975 liu et al 2016 the reason is that wave forces of ocean structures such as the pile group foundation are very complex due to their special structural forms moreover wave forces of ocean structures are also easily affected by wave conditions for example some special dynamic behaviors such as impact action wave breaking and wave submerged the structure will occur under different wave conditions e g water level wave height wave period etc the existing simplified method is not enough to accurately simulate the interaction between waves and pile group foundations in terms of the interaction between waves and pile group foundations researchers had contributed critical research works taking the pile group foundation of east sea bridge as the prototype liu et al 2007 studied wave force properties of the single pile and the pile group the experimental results show that wave forces of an inclined pile with a small angle can be calculated according to the vertical pile however the influence of pile inclinations on the foundation wave forces is not clear and the effect of the pile cap on the foundation wave forces needs further discussion wei et al 2013 investigated the influence of the fluid structure interaction on modal dynamic responses of pile group foundations through model test and numerical simulation liu et al 2017 made the dynamic model of a pile group foundation according to the geometric scale of 1 100 and dynamic responses of piles and the pile cap was then studied under the single or combined action of earthquakes waves and currents the effect of the pile cap on wave forces of the pile group was investigated by deng et al 2019 at the same time they also analyzed the variation of the pile cap effect coefficient with wave heights wavelengths pile cap sizes and submergence depths wu and yang 2020 established a numerical model considering the interaction of earthquakes waves and ocean currents and analyzed wave force characteristics of the pile group however the wave force properties of the pile cap and the pile group foundation are lack of discussion xu et al 2020 studied the influence of the pile group clearance heights and wave heights on wave forces of an elevated pile cap through the model test and the time history characteristics of wave forces of the pile cap were explored under different wave conditions this research provides an important reference for revealing the interaction between the pile group and the pile cap it can be found that researches on the interaction between pile group foundations and waves are relatively less especially related experimental researches in addition the effect of the pile group and the pile cap on wave forces of the pile group foundation also needed further investigation the pile group foundation of sea crossing bridges in deep water often presents the following three characteristics in structural forms 1 the increase in water depth results in longer piles bridge engineering will continue to extend from inshore areas to the deep sea in the future at present china had planned to build sea crossing channels across qiongzhou strait lin et al 2016 bohai bay wu et al 2020 and taiwan strait shi et al 2003 it is predicted that the maximum water depth of the sea crossing bridge may exceed 100 m in the future song et al 2020 2 it is necessary to set inclined piles to resist huge horizontal forces in the pile group foundation for example pile group foundations of the east sea bridge and qinhuangdao dalian sea crossing bridge were equipped with inclined piles to resist horizontal forces liu et al 2007 wu and qiu 2020 3 the size of the pile cap is large and its shape is various there are various cross section forms of pile caps the most common shapes are round square and the combination of round and square also some pile caps have conical slopes on the top surface to reduce impact forces of floating objects on the sea for example to reduce impact loads of floating ices the top surface of the pile cap for confederation bridge in canada was set to be conical brown and määttänen 2009 and the top surface of some pile caps for hong kong zhuhai macao bridge was also set to be conical jing 2020 sun et al 2019 structural forms of pile group foundations for sea crossing bridges are various and different water depths pile spacings pile slopes pile inclination directions and structural forms of pile caps will have a greater influence on wave forces of pile group foundations which still needs to be investigated systematically this study aims to investigate the effect of structural forms of pile group foundations on its wave force characteristics and to analyze the evolution law of the wave impact behavior therefore an analytical model for predicting maximum wave forces of the pile group foundation with a square pile cap was established by utilizing the morrison equation and boundary element method in this work in addition according to the gravity similarity criterion eight hydrodynamic models of pile group foundations with different pile spacings and pile slopes were designed and made in which the geometric scale of models was 1 40 moreover we installed an inclined plate on the top surface of the model to simulate the conical slope on the top surface of the pile cap further through model test and analytical calculation the effect of different pile spacings pile slopes conical slopes and wave parameters on wave forces of pile group foundations were studied and the impact force properties of waves on the foundation were also analyzed 2 experimental set up 2 1 wave testing facilities the experiments were performed in a 40 m long 8 m wide and 1 m deep wave flume as shown in fig 1 in the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology one end of the flume was equipped with a hydraulic type wave generator which was designed by the dalian university of technology and could generate various one dimensional wave environments such as linear and nonlinear regular wave irregular wave focused wave etc the wave generator was equipped with a data acquisition system and controlled by a microcomputer system in the process of making waves the microcomputer system generated the driving signal of the wave generator according to the wave making file and the waves was then made through the motion of the wave generator the actual wave information collected by the data acquisition system in the water flume was fed back to the microcomputer system and the motion command of the wave generator was automatically iterated and corrected according to the feedback until the expected waves are made the wave absorbing beach which is made of porous polymer material was located at the other end of the flume to absorb wave energy and reduce wave reflection a movable steel truss bridge was installed on the upper part of the flume to fix observe and adjust the model during the experiment the steel truss bridge was located at the middle of the flume and the model was installed at the middle of the bridge the model was 20 m away from the front of the flume and 4 m away from both sides of the flume a wave gauge of the type dly 1 developed by the dalian university of technology was utilized to measure the elevation data of wave surface in this experiment before the test the wave gauge was calibrated and the calibration linearity was greater than 0 999 the wave gauge was installed at 1m away from the model and its sampling frequency was set to 100 hz that is sufficient to record the fluctuation of water surface in the following testing the cartesian coordinate of the water flume was defined as illustrated in fig 1 a and b x direction is the longitudinal direction from the wave generator to the wave absorbing beach y direction is the transverse direction and z direction is the vertical direction with positive direction upward the force moment sensor produced by the nitta company of japan was used to measure both force and torque acting on the model along x y and z directions the maximum measurement ranges of this sensor are respectively 100 n in horizontal direction 200 n in z direction and 11 n m in three directions previous experiments guo et al 2015 xu et al 2020 show that the sampling frequency of the sensor is set to 200hz which is sufficient to collect the impulsive forces and structural responses signals in this study we chosen 500hz which is higher than 200 hz as the sampling frequency of the sensor to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of the measurements during the test 2 2 design and installation of models in this study the pile group foundation was composed of a square pile cap and the pile group 2 2 arrangement and the gravity similarity criterion xu et al 2020 was used to guide the design of models this criterion indicates that the structural geometric dimension and the flow velocity at corresponding points should satisfy the following relationship in flow fields of the prototype and model 1 v p 2 l p g p v m 2 l m g m where v is the flow velocity the subscript p represents the prototype flow field and the subscript m expresses the model flow field l is the geometric dimension and g is the gravity acceleration generally gravity accelerations in two flow fields are equal i e g p g m the geometric scale λ l p l m according to eq 1 the flow velocity scale can be therefore expressed as λ v v p v m λ 1 2 further the time scale λ t λ λ v λ 1 2 the frequency scale λ f 1 λ t λ 1 2 and the force scale λ f λ ρ λ 2 λ v 2 λ ρ λ 3 λ ρ denotes the fluid density scale λ ρ 1 in this experiment it can be seen from the above calculation that once the geometric scale is determined the scales of other physical quantities can be calculated according to eq 1 for the geometric scale λ we expect that it can be set smaller to obtain better model test results in this investigation the geometric scale λ was selected as 40 in consideration of the experimental contents and the conditions of the experimental facilities the conversion relationship between geometric scale and other relevant physical scales could be therefore calculated and listed in table 1 the size of the square pile cap was 325 mm 325 mm 100 mm length width height the pile diameter d was 50 mm and the pile length was 500 mm as shown in fig 2 for the pile group the pile group effect cannot be ignored if s g 4d s g is the pile spacing which represents the distance between the centers of two piles bonakdar et al 2015 generally the pile spacing s g in bridges is less than 4d in order to study the influence of pile spacings s g four pile group models fig 2 a and b were designed with pile spacings of 1 5d 2d 2 5d and 3d respectively to investigate the effect of pile slopes s p the ratio of horizontal projection length l t to vertical projection length l v we designed four pile group models fig 2 c and d with pile slopes of 1 5 1 4 1 3 and 1 2 respectively in addition in order to analyze the influence of the conical slopes s c on the top of the pile cap we set an inclined plate on the top surface of the pile cap to simulate the conical slope and designed four kinds of conical slopes fig 2 e and f which were 1 1 1 25 1 1 75 1 and 2 25 1 respectively the model was made of plexiglass material which has the advantages of lightweight and high stiffness and has been widely used in the model test of hydraulic structures liu et al 2007 xu et al 2020 the thickness of plates and pipes used in the experiment was adopted as 5 mm to ensure the stiffness and strength of the model fig 3 shows the installation diagram of the model a steel truss beam was welded between the two steel truss bridges at the upper part of the flume to connect and fix the model and equipment below a movable device that can adjust up and down position was fixed under the steel truss beam the device was composed of two 10 mm thick plexiglass plates and eight bolts and the relative position of bolts and plexiglass plates was adjusted to realize the up and down movement of the whole model the force moment sensor was fixed under the movable device the sensor and the model were connected by a 15 cm high rigid connector which was welded by four 3 mm thick steel plates the rigid connector can avoid the contact between the sensor and water in the process of wave motion 2 3 test conditions the wave condition used in this experiment was the regular wave generally the wave height of several meters is the most common in the ocean environment and the period is usually 3 15s chakrabarti 2005 therefore combined with the similarity relationship listed in table 1 the wave height h of the test regular wave was set as 0 04 m 0 06 m 0 08 m and 0 1 m respectively and the wave period t was set as 1 s 1 3 s 1 6 s and 1 9 s respectively besides the pile cap of sea crossing bridges is often close to the sea lever in the low water level waves may only act on pile groups while at high water level the wave may submerge the pile cap consequently we designed three water depth conditions which were 0 47 m 0 53 m and 0 58 m respectively the relative position relationship between water depth d and model is described in fig 4 2 4 wave making test in order to test the performance of regular waves produced by the wave generator four groups of regular waves were randomly selected for wave making test in the flume the specific parameters of four groups of regular waves were listed in table 2 le mehaute 1976 used two dimensionless independent parameters h gt 2 and d gt 2 to clarify the applicability of various wave theories after that zhu 1983 analyzed a large number of measured data and theoretical calculation data considered that the calculation results of the 2nd order stokes wave theory were generally larger and suggested that the 5th order stokes wave theory was more suitable when t g d 1 2 10 it can be seen from table 2 that according to the research of le mehaute 1976 the 2nd order stokes wave theory is applicable to the four groups of regular waves listed in table 2 at the same time we also considered the suggestion of zhu 1983 and it is more appropriate to adopt the 5th order stokes wave theory in this experiment fig 5 presents the comparison between the measured wave surface motion and the theoretical solution of four groups of regular waves it can be found that the measured results are in good agreement with the theoretical solutions which indicates that the regular waves generated by the wave generator can satisfy the experimental requirements 2 5 modal analysis of foundation models if low order mode frequencies of a hydrodynamic model are similar to wave frequencies resonance will appear in the process of the experiment which makes the measured wave forces be amplified and seriously affects the experimental results wei et al 2017 xu et al 2020 moreover related studies zhang et al 2019 show that the first order modal frequency of a structure in the water will gradually decrease with the rise of the water level we therefore expect that the first order mode frequency of the model is much higher than frequencies of experimental waves to avoid the influence of the model natural frequency on the test results it is thus necessary to carry out the modal analysis on the plexiglass models of pile group foundations before the experiment the density elastic modulus and poisson s ratio of the plexiglass material used in the model are 1180 kg m3 2 94 gpa and 0 25 respectively according to the model size fig 2 material parameters and restraint conditions after the model was installed the finite element solid models of eight pile group foundations were established by using the ansys software version 14 0 and the modal analysis was carried out fig 6 presents the 1st order modal frequencies and shapes of all models the experimental results of guo et al 2015 and xu et al 2020 show that structural wave forces appear the characteristics of the multi peak in the frequency domain under the action of regular waves the frequency corresponding to the maximum peak is the wave frequency and the other peak frequencies are the multiples of the wave frequency in this study the maximum experimental wave frequency was 1 hz t 1 s and fig 7 plots the spectrum curves of wave forces for a pile group foundation model under the wave action at this frequency in fig 7 the wave forces of the model also present multi peak characteristics combined with fig 6 it can be found that the 1st order mode frequency of all models is greater than 20 hz while in fig 7 the amplitude of wave force is very small when f 5 hz which indicates that the natural vibration characteristics of all models have little influence on the test results in this investigation 3 calculation model of wave forces in this study the wave forces of the pile group foundation are considered as the combination of wave forces of the pile group and the pile cap for the pile group the dimension of a single pile is often relatively small d l 0 2 where d is diameter and l is wavelength therefore the wave force of a single pile can be solved by the morison equation and the wave force of the whole pile group can be further calculated by considering the pile group effect on the contrary the dimension of the pile cap is relatively large d l 0 2 the diffraction effect of the wave should be hence considered when calculating wave forces of the pile cap there is a top fixed pile group foundation in the finite water depth d the cartesian coordinate system was adopted to describe the position relationship of the model let the oxy plane be the top surface of the fluid the x direction is consistent with the wave propagation direction and the z direction point upwards moreover the centroid of the pile group foundation was set on the z axis we also assumed that the elevations at the bottom of the pile cap and the pile were h1 and h2 respectively then the calculation model of wave forces for the pile group foundation can be established as illustrated in fig 8 3 1 wave force calculation of the pile group because the small diameter cylinder in water has little influence on the wave motion it can be concluded that the wave forces of the small diameter cylinder are mainly caused by the viscous effect and the added mass effect morison et al 1950 the horizontal wave forces acting on the unit height of a vertical cylinder is calculated as follows 2 f x 1 2 c d d u x u x 1 4 c m ρ π d 2 a x where ρ is the water density c d and c m are the drag force coefficient and inertia force coefficient respectively and they are related to kc number reynolds number and surface roughness in this study c d 1 2 and c m 2 according to the research of sarpkaya 1977 u x and a x are the horizontal velocity and acceleration of the water particle at any height z on the axis of the cylinder for the 5th order stokes wave the expressions of u x and a x are as follows chakrabarti 2005 3 u x c n 1 5 n λ n cosh n k z d cos n k x cos θ y sin θ ω t 4 a x ω c n 1 5 n 2 λ n cosh n k z d sin n k x cos θ y sin θ ω t where c is wave velocity k is wave number d is water depth θ is the angle between incident wave and x axis ω is circular frequency the calculation of coefficient λ n can be referred to relevant literature zhu 1983 for an inclined cylinder the calculation formula of wave forces on the unit cylinder height can be expressed as follows 5 f 1 2 c d d u n u n 1 4 c m ρ π d 2 a n where f f x i f y j f z k u n u x i u y j u z k which is the velocity vector of the water particle orthogonal to the axis of the cylinder a n a x i a y j a z k which is the acceleration vector of the water particle orthogonal to the axis of the cylinder let the unit vector on the axis of the cylinder is e i e e e x i e y j e z k it can be then educed from fig 9 a that e x sin φ cos η e y sin φ sin η and e z cos φ if the velocity vector of the water particle is u then 6 u n e u e 7 a n u n t where u u x i u y j u z k since only unidirectional wave action is considered in this investigate u y 0 u x can be calculated by eq 3 and u z is expressed as follows chakrabarti 2005 8 u z c n 1 5 n λ n sinh n k z d sin n k x cos θ y sin θ ω t furthermore according to eq 6 eq 7 and fig

e z e y u z t a z e x e z u x t 1 e z 2 u z t comparing eq 5 with eq 2 it can be found that the calculation formula of wave forces on a vertical cylinder is a special form of that on an inclined cylinder because the unit vector e of the vertical cylinder is k we can get eq 2 by substituting e k into eq 5 and the f y and f z are zero combined with fig 8 we can further calculate the wave forces on a single pile as follows 11 f i h 1 h 2 f d z where i is the pile number and f i is the wave force on the pile i for the pile group with s g 4d the pile group effect must be considered gao et al 1987 used the pile group coefficients which including interference coefficient k g and shielding coefficient k z to describe the interaction between the wave forces on every single pile in the pile group specifically the interference coefficient k g was utilized to describe the interaction of wave forces between side by side piles and the shielding coefficient k z was used to describe the shielding effect of the front pile on the back pile in tandem piles the two coefficients are the ratio of wave force that is f group f single where f group is the wave forces on a single pile in the pile group under wave loads f single is the wave forces on only a single vertical pile under the same wave loads gao et al 1987 considered that the ratio s d s d s g d 1 in fig 8 had the greatest influence on the pile group coefficients and the estimation formulas of the two coefficients were determined through experiments the formulas are as follows 12 k g 1 265 0 225 ln s d 13 k z 0 836 0 141 ln s d in the subsequent related studies li et al 1993 researchers found that kc number also had a great influence on pile group coefficients after that through a large number of model tests bonakdar et al 2015 redefined the estimation formulas of two coefficients by considering the influence of kc number and s d the estimation formulas are as follows 14 k g 1 14 s d 0 19 s d 1 5 a n d k c 6 0 87 s d 0 51 k c 0 26 s d 1 5 a n d 6 k c 13 1 4 s d 0 46 e 52 7 k c 2 22 s d 1 5 a n d k c 13 1 1 1 5 s d 2 1 s d 2 15 k z 1 0 074 s d 0 8 e k c 56 s d 3 1 s d 3 in addition the china standard named code of hydrology for harbor and waterway jts 145 2015 fang et al 2016 corrected a large number of experimental and field measured data and proposed the pile group coefficients suitable for engineering structures as shown in table 3 in table 3 only the pile group coefficients under three s g d conditions are listed for other s g d conditions the coefficients can be selected by the method of linear interpolation comparing with eq 12 eq 15 and table 3 it can be found that when the s g d is the same the pile group coefficients recommended in table 3 are the largest followed by the estimated value of eq 12 eq 13 and the estimated value of eq 14 eq 15 is the smallest which is related to the estimation method of pile group coefficients eq 12 eq 15 are derived only from the experimental data while the coefficients in table 3 are determined after correcting the experimental data and the field measured data which makes the coefficients in table 3 more suitable to apply in the engineering calculation method for wave forces of the single pile i e morrison equation in addition considering the influence of kc number in the test also make pile group coefficients smaller eq 14 eq 15 then the wave forces of the pile group can be calculated according to the following formula 16 f i 1 m k g k z f i where m is the number of piles 3 2 boundary element method for calculating wave forces on the rectangular pile cap 3 2 1 governing equations and boundary conditions the research of chakrabarti and tam 1975 shows that when 2a d 0 25 and 0 kd 2 3 where a is the wave amplitude the action of waves on large scale structures can be regarded as the diffraction problem of linear potential waves on structures in this study all the waves meet the above conditions therefore the action of waves on the pile cap can be considered as the diffraction problem of linear potential waves on the pile cap in that way the total wave velocity potential φ x y z t is the superposition of incident potential φ i x y z t and diffraction potential φ d x y z t the expression is as follows 17a φ x y z t φ i x y z t φ d x y z t the time variable t is further separated and the eq 17a is transformed into 17b ψ x y z e i ω t ψ i x y z e i ω t ψ d x y z e i ω t where i 1 the spatial variables x and y of the linear incident potential ψ i x y z in the eq 17b can be also separated ψ i x y z is then rewritten as 18a ψ i x y z i g ω h 2 cosh k z d cosh k d e i k x cos θ y sin θ where g is the acceleration of gravity we define ϕ i x y e ik xcosθ ysinθ eq 18a can be thus transformed into 18b ψ i x y z i g ω h 2 cosh k z d cosh k d ϕ i x y the diffraction potential ψ d x y z should have the same mathematical expression as the incident potential ψ i x y z then 19 ψ d x y z i g ω h 2 cosh k z d cosh k d ϕ d x y at the same time the diffraction potential ψ d x y z should also satisfy the laplace equation and some corresponding boundary conditions 20a 2 ψ d 0 in the domain 20b ψ d z

eq 20e the governing equations and corresponding boundary conditions only related to the unknown diffraction potential ϕ d x y can be obtained 21a 2 ϕ d k 2 ϕ d 0 in the domain 21b ϕ d n ϕ i n on the structural surface 21c l i m r r ϕ d r i k ϕ d 0 at infinity where r 2 x 2 y 2 it can be found that the three dimensional boundary value problem eq 20a eq 20e is transformed into the two dimensional boundary value problem eq 21a eq 21c for the structure with constant cross section along the z direction we can first solve the two dimensional diffraction potential ϕ d x y and then calculate the three dimensional diffraction potential ψ d x y z by using the integral method furthermore by superposition of the three dimensional diffraction potential ψ d x y z and the three dimensional incident potential ψ i x y z we can obtain the total velocity potential φ x y z in the wave field finally the total velocity potential φ x y z can be used to calculate the wave forces on the pile cap 3 2 2 boundary integral equation and its discrete form eq 21a is helmholtz equation and the fundamental solution g of helmholtz equation is presented in eq 22 22 g i 4 h 0 1 k r p q where h 0 1 x denotes the hankel function of the first kind k is the wave number p and q are any two points in the domain their coordinates are x y and ξ η respectively r pq 2 x ξ 2 y η 2 then the fundamental solution g satisfies the helmholtz equation shown in eq 23 23 2 g k 2 g δ m n 0 where δ is a two dimensional dirac delta function the two dimensional boundary value problem represented by eq 21a eq 21c is a helmholtz equation problem in two connected domains as shown in fig 10 a the boundary integral equation of this problem is as follows kim et al 2007 24 c ϕ d γ c γ g ϕ d n d γ γ c γ ϕ d g n d γ where c is a constant related to the boundary geometry at point p as described in fig 10 b the calculation formula of constant c is as follows 25 c p α p 2 π kim et al 2007 deduced that the integral term on the right side of eq 24 is equal to zero on the infinite boundary γ by using the radiation boundary condition eq 21c further by substituting the boundary condition eq 21b into eq 24 the boundary integral equation is obtained as follows 26a c ϕ d γ c ϕ d g n d γ γ c g ϕ i n d γ for rectangular boundaries as shown in fig 10 c the discrete form of eq 26a can be written as follows 26b c p ϕ d p q

when point p is located at other positions on the square boundary c p 0 5 eq 26b can also be written in matrix form shown in eq 26c 26c a ϕ bq where a and b are matrices of order m m and the calculation of their elements is presented in eq 27 and eq 28 ϕ is the matrix of order m 1 which is composed of m two dimensional diffraction potentials ϕ d q is the matrix of order m 1 which is

on the surface of the pile cap is as follows 30 p ρ φ t substituting eq 17 eq 19 into eq 30 we can derive the following equation 31 p ρ g h 2 cosh k z d cosh k d ϕ i ϕ d e i ω t combined with figs 9

that is n x cos n x n y cos n y 3 2 4 modelling and validation wave forces on a rectangular pile cap xu et al 2020 measured the wave forces of a square pile cap under different regular wave conditions this study takes this as an example to describe and verify the application of boundary element method in the calculation of wave forces for a rectangular pile cap the top fixed cap specimen is located in the water with a depth of 0 9 m the dimension of the cap specimen is a rigid box with length of 0 4 m width of 0 267 m and height of 0 15 m the wave direction is consistent with the x axis and is perpendicular to the long side of the pile cap the still water level is higher than the bottom of the pile cap and the distance between them is 0 075 m which is half the height of the pile cap we assume that the oxy plane be the still water surface the z direction point upwards and the centroid of the cap specimen is on the z axis then the calculation model of wave forces for the square pile cap can be established as illustrated in fig 11 a fig 11 b shows the pseudo code of the calculation of wave forces on the pile cap and describes the calculation process overall the calculation process can be divided into the following parts firstly the parameters related to waves including wave height h period t water depth d water density ρ and acceleration of gravity g were input into the calculation program the wavelength l and wave number k were then solved according to the linear dispersion relation which can be expressed as follows 34 l g t 2 2 π tanh k d where k 2π l eq 34 can be solved by iterative method in this investigation the initial wavelength l 0 g t 2 2 π and the convergence accuracy ε was determined as 0 0001 the rectangular boundary г c on the oxy plane was discretized into m elements and the coordinates x q y q of the element nodes were then calculated this study selects the constant element to simulate the boundary and the element length δl was set to 1 mm the whole boundary was therefore divided into 1334 elements i e m 1334 it should be noted that the four corner points of the rectangular boundary were defined as the start or end points of an element to ensure that each element is continuous on the boundary thus the constant c in boundary integral equation eq 26a is equal to 0 5 for this example because the field point p and the source point q are located on the boundary the matrix a and b which related to two points could be calculated according to eqs 27 and 28 respectively at the same time the matrix q could be solved by utilizing eq 29 the matrix of diffraction potentials at each element node could be further obtained by the following formula 35 ϕ a 1 bq where the matrix ϕ contains the diffraction potentials of all element nodes on the boundary i e ϕ d x q y q after that the incident potentials at all element nodes were calculated by using eq 18 i e ϕ i x q y q finally by superposing the diffraction potential ϕ d and the incident potential ϕ i and utilizing eqs 32 and 33 the wave forces of the pile cap can be obtained because the incident direction of waves is consistent with the x direction in this example the wave forces in y direction is zero i e f y 0 the measured maximum horizontal wave forces under four different wave conditions were compared with the calculation results of the presented method which are listed in table 4 it can be seen from table 4 that the calculation results of the presented method match well with the measured results which shows that the calculation model of wave forces for the square pile cap presented in this paper is correct and the solution for the diffraction problem of the square pile cap has high accuracy 4 results and discussions 4 1 influence of pile spacings fig 12 shows the influence of pile spacings on the wave forces of the foundation under different water level conditions in which the wave height is 0 06 m and the period is 1 3 s when the water depth d 0 47 m the waves only act on the pile group at this time the maximum wave force of the foundation is shown in fig 12 a and b it can be seen that the horizontal wave forces and vertical wave forces decrease with the increase of pile spacings for the results calculated with the proposed method the horizontal wave forces with three different pile group coefficients also show a nearly linear decreasing trend with the increase of pile spacings which is consistent with the experimental results however the maximum wave forces calculated according to different pile group coefficients have a relatively large deviation the maximum deviation reaches 13 881 when the coefficients in jts 145 2015 and the formula proposed by gao et al 1987 are used to calculate wave forces of the pile group s g 1 5d in general the horizontal wave forces calculated according to jts 145 2015 table 3 is the largest followed by the formula proposed by gao et al 1987 and the horizontal wave forces calculated according to eq 14 and eq 15 is the smallest which is mainly caused by the different values of pile group coefficients in fig 12 a the maximum wave forces calculated according to the pile group coefficients in jts 145 2015 are similar to the experimental results and the former is larger than the latter in most pile spacing conditions in engineering design we expect that the predicted wave forces are greater than the measured wave forces and the difference between them is not significant therefore compared with other calculation methods of pile group coefficients jts 145 2015 is more suitable for engineering design also compared with eq 12 eq 15 and table 3 it can be found that the pile group coefficients estimated by eq 12 eq 15 are more suitable for predicting the wave forces of the pile group on a premise which is knowing measured data of wave forces on a single pile while the pile group coefficients recommended by jts 145 2015 table 3 are more suitable for predicting the wave forces of the pile group by using the morrison equation it should be noted that the pile group coefficients recommended by jts 145 2015 are adopted for the calculation of wave forces on the foundation under all subsequent wave conditions in this study when the water depth d 0 53 m the water level slightly exceeds the bottom of the pile cap fig 4 and the wave interacts with the foundation composed of the pile group and a small part of the pile cap we added an experiment for measuring wave forces on an isolated pile cap without piles in this water depth fig 12 c and d present the maximum wave forces of the foundation it can be seen that the horizontal and vertical wave forces decrease with the increase of pile spacings but the decrease rate of wave forces is slower than that of d 0 47 m the reason is that the wave forces on the pile cap account for a relatively large part of the wave forces on the foundation especially for vertical wave forces shown in fig 12 d the maximum vertical wave forces on the pile cap accounts for 98 259 of that on the pile group foundation when s g 3d the proportion of the maximum horizontal wave forces of the pile cap on that of the foundation is relatively reduced nevertheless the proportion also reached 74 888 when s g 3d in fig 12 c this demonstrates that as long as the pile cap participates in the interaction between waves and the foundation the effect of pile spacings will be weakened on the other hand it is also illustrated that the pile spacings have a significant influence on the wave forces of the pile group but it is not obvious for the pile cap in addition compared with the isolated pile cap without piles fig 12 c and d indicate that even if only a small part of the pile cap participates in the wave interaction the wave forces on the pile cap cannot be ignored and the existence of the pile cap significantly increases the overall wave forces of the pile group foundation in fig 12 c the measured maximum horizontal wave forces are in good agreement with the calculation results the maximum deviation is 7 445 when s g 1 5d which indicates that the presented method is correct and can be applied to the prediction of horizontal wave force on the pile group foundation when the water depth d 0 58 m the water level is located at the middle of the pile cap and the wave acts on a large part of the pile cap fig 12 e shows the typical time history curves of horizontal wave forces and corresponding maximum wave forces on the foundation it can be found that the four horizontal wave force curves almost coincide indicating that the pile spacing has little influence on the overall wave forces of the foundation under this water level in addition the maximum horizontal wave forces decrease slowly with the increase of pile spacings which illustrates that the wave forces of the pile cap account for a large part of the wave forces on the foundation fig 12 f presents the maximum vertical wave forces of the foundation the vertical wave forces decrease with the increase of pile spacings moreover compared with fig 12 b the vertical wave forces decrease more slowly when d 0 58 m 4 2 influence of pile slopes to investigate the effect of pile slopes four models of the pile group foundation are designed based on the foundation model of vertical pile group with the pile spacing s g 2d the pile slopes s p are 1 5 1 4 1 3 and 1 2 and the corresponding inclination angles the angle between pile axis and z axis are 11 31 14 036 18 435 and 26 565 respectively in addition we also studied the influence of two different wave motion directions in the experiment one is that the direction of the pile inclination is consistent with the wave motion direction i e case 1 and the other is that the direction of the pile inclination is perpendicular to the wave motion direction i e case 2 fig 13 shows the comparison results between the measured values and the calculated solutions of the maximum wave forces of foundation models under different water depths among them two kinds of calculation results are presented namely considering pile group effect and ignoring pile group effect besides the wave forces of the vertical pile group foundation are also plotted in fig 13 as a comparison condition the wave height is 0 06 m and the period is 1 3 s in this test fig 13 a and b show the maximum horizontal and vertical wave forces of the foundation at water depth d 0 47 m respectively at this moment the wave only acts on the pile group both the measured and calculated results illustrate that the increase of pile slopes reduces the wave forces of the pile group foundation moreover when the wave motion direction is perpendicular to the direction of the pile inclination i e case 2 the decreasing speed of wave forces is more significant the reason is that the pile group effect is weakened or the pile spacing is increased to some extent when the pile group tilts outward because the inclination direction of piles in case 1 is the same as the direction of the wave motion increasing the pile slope has little influence on the spacing of side by side piles but it increases the spacing of tandem piles which will weaken the shielding effect of the pile group case 2 is opposite to case 1 in case 2 the inclination direction of piles is perpendicular to the direction of the wave motion therefore the increase of the pile slope will weaken the interference effect but has little effect on the shielding effect in fig 13 a with the increase of the pile slope the measured values in case 1 are more inclined to the calculation results considering the pile group effect while the measured values in case 2 are gradually consistent with the calculation results neglecting the pile group effect fig 13 b also shows that the maximum vertical wave forces in case 1 are larger than that in case 2 all these indicate that the influence of the interference effect on the wave forces of the pile group is greater than that of the shielding effect on the wave forces of the pile group under the same conditions the maximum difference for transverse wave forces between case 1 and case 2 is 18 309 when s p 1 3 while the maximum deviation for vertical wave forces increases to 28 302 when s p 1 2 this illustrate that the inclination direction of piles has more influence on the vertical wave forces of the pile group fig 13 c and d present the maximum wave forces of the foundation when d 0 53 m and a small part of the pile cap participates in the wave action at this time it can be found that the wave forces on the foundation present a gradually decreasing trend with the increase of pile slope compared with fig 13 a and b the reduction rate of the maximum wave forces slows down at the same time the maximum difference for horizontal wave forces between case 1 and case 2 is 9 522 when s p 1 2 under the same conditions however the maximum vertical wave forces in case1 and case2 are similar in all pile slope conditions and the maximum deviation for vertical wave forces is 2 255 when s p 1 5 this is quite different from the result of d 0 47 m and explains that the influence of the pile group effect on the wave forces of the foundation is significantly weakened due to the pile cap participating in the wave action when d 0 58 m the maximum wave forces of the pile group foundation are shown in fig 13 e and f at this moment a large part of the pile cap participates in the wave action it can be seen that the maximum wave forces in all conditions have little difference and the wave forces change little with the increase of pile slopes which indicates that the wave forces on the pile group foundation is controlled by the wave force of the pile cap and the pile slope is no longer an important influence factor therefore when designing the pile group foundation of sea crossing bridges the inclined piles can be regarded as the vertical piles when calculating the wave forces of the foundation with inclined piles at high water level which is far higher than the bottom elevation of the pile cap 4 3 influence of conical slopes in this experiment the conical slopes s c on the top of the pile cap are 1 1 1 25 1 1 75 1 and 2 25 1 respectively in addition the foundation without conical slope i e s c 0 is also analyzed as a contrast condition the wave height is 0 1 m the period is 1 3 s and the water depth is 0 58 m in this test the amplitude spectrums of the wave forces on the foundation are shown in fig 14 and fig 15 presents the instantaneous position of waves at four typical moments fig 15 a1 fig 15 a4 in fig 14 the amplitude spectrums of wave forces show multi peak characteristics and the peak frequency is a multiple of the wave frequency the wave force corresponding to the maximum peak is generated by the wave action while the other peak wave forces are mainly caused by the wave nonlinearity and the high order velocity potential from the incident and diffracted waves guo et al 2015 there are two obvious peaks in fig 14 a among them the first peak increases with the increase of the conical slopes the horizontal wave forces increase by 8 962 when s c 2 25 1 which indicates that the existence of the conical slope will increase the horizontal wave forces of the foundation however there is little difference in the second peak under all s c conditions which is consistent with the actual situation because the wave parameters such as period wave height water depth etc are the same under all s c conditions that is the wave nonlinear factors are the same the second peak will not change significantly in fig 14 b only the peak value of vertical wave forces corresponding to wave frequency is the most obvious and the peak wave force also increases with the increase of conical slopes compared with s c 0 the vertical wave forces increase by 13 766 when s c 2 25 1 it can be seen from fig 15 that when the wave reaches the left side of the pile cap fig 15 a1 fig 15 f1 the water surface is slightly deformed due to the influence of the previous wave when the wave continues to move forward until the crest reaches the left side of the pile cap fig 15 a2 fig 15 f2 the wave runs up along the pile cap in this process because the height of the wave crest exceeds the top elevation of the pile cap for the case s c 0 fig 15 b2 the wave directly submerged the pile cap however for the other cases fig 15 b2 fig 15 f2 the wave continues to climb up along the slope on the top of the pile cap in this process the horizontal wave force will increase to the maximum as the wave continues to move forward the wave will gradually fall along the slope and the left side of the pile cap by comparing fig 15 b2 fig 15 f2 it can be seen that the existence of the slope on the top of the pile cap significantly increases the water blocking area of the pile cap at the same time the increase of the slope leads to the enhancement of the interaction between the pile cap and waves the wave forces of the pile group foundation are therefore increased for the engineering design of the pile cap of sea crossing bridges it is suggested not to set the slope on the top of the pile cap as far as possible which can reduce the wave forces of the foundation and save the construction cost 4 4 influence of wave parameters the wave forces of the pile group foundation under different wave parameters are shown in fig 16 when d 0 47 m fig 16 a and b present the amplitude spectrums of the wave forces on the foundation under the same wave height h 0 04 m and different periods it can be found that the first peak values of horizontal and vertical wave force decrease with the increase of the period while the second peak values increase with the increase of the period fig 16 c and d summarize the first and second peaks of the wave forces on the foundation under different wave heights and periods it can be seen that under the same wave height condition the first peak wave forces decrease gradually with the increase of the period while the second peak wave forces increase with the increase of the period which indicates that the wave period or the wave frequency is an important factor affecting the wave forces of the pile group foundation in addition fig 16 also shows that the nonlinear influence of waves increases with the increase of the period the second peak value compared with the first peak wave forces the second peak wave forces are smaller this indicates that the wave forces of the foundation are weakly affected by the wave nonlinear factors and the wave forces of the pile group foundation are mainly provided by the first peak wave forces fig 16 c and d also present that under the same period conditions the increase of the wave height can significantly increase the wave forces of the foundation because the wave energy is proportional to the square of the wave height h the wave with larger wave height will have more energy acting on the foundation in unit time which leads to the increase of the wave forces on the pile group foundation because the experimental wave frequencies are limited only four wave frequencies in this investigation the experimental results cannot represent the wave force characteristics of the pile group in a wide frequency band therefore based on the experimental model and wave conditions we calculated the wave forces on a single pile by utilizing morrison equation eq 2 in the wide wave band and further discussed the influence of wave frequencies or wave periods on the wave forces of the single pile it should be noted that the wave forces of the pile group are obtained by superposition of wave forces on multiple single piles the wave forces on a vertical pile are therefore studied in this study to illustrate the wave force characteristics of the pile group morrison equation eq 2 shows that the wave force f p on a small diameter cylinder consists of two parts the drag force f d which is proportional to the square of the velocity of the water particle and the inertial force f m which is proportional to the acceleration of the water particle the variation of three wave forces f p f d and f m with wave frequencies is shown in fig 17 in fig 17 with the increase of wave frequencies the three wave forces show different changes the maximum wave forces f p on the single pile firstly decrease then increase the drag forces f d gradually decrease and the inertia force f m presents an increasing trend under a single wave frequency the maximum wave force on the single pile is not the algebraic sum of the maximum values of the drag force and the inertia force which is caused by the phase difference between the drag force and the inertia force in the case of low frequencies long period surge wave the proportion of the drag forces and the inertia forces in the wave forces on the single pile is little difference but the wave forces of the single pile are mainly provided by the inertia forces at high frequencies it can also be seen from fig 17 that the wave height has a significant effect on the three wave forces especially for the drag forces at low frequencies which increase sharply with the increase of the wave height in addition the four periods in the experiment are also shown in fig 17 it is found that the wave forces on the single pile decrease with the increase of the period which is consistent with the variation of the first peak in the experimental results when the water depth increases to 0 53 m a small part of the pile cap also participates in the wave action fig 18 a and b display the time history curves of wave forces on the foundation at four periods when h 0 04 m the time history curves of wave forces on the foundation at four periods when h 0 1 m are shown in fig 18 c and d in fig 18 a and b the deviation between the positive wave forces and the negative wave forces is relatively small and the curve has a comparatively smooth waveform however in fig 18 c and d the positive wave forces are significantly greater than the negative wave forces under all period conditions and the curve waveform is rough which reflects strong wave impact characteristics this indicates that when the water level is near the bottom of the pile cap the greater wave height induces the stronger wave impact on the pile cap in addition it can also be seen that with the increase of the wave period the horizontal wave forces of the foundation decrease gradually but the vertical wave forces show the increasing trend fig 18 e compares the wave force spectrums of the pile group foundation and the isolated pile cap under the same wave condition h 0 06 m t 1 3 s it is found that their vertical wave forces are almost the same while the horizontal wave forces of the pile group foundation are significantly greater than that of the isolated pile cap this illustrates that the vertical wave forces of the pile group foundation are mainly provided by the wave forces of the pile cap but for the horizontal wave forces on the pile group foundation the proportion of the pile group and the pile cap cannot be ignored therefore combined with figs 16 d 18 b and 18 d and 18 e it can be found that the decrease of wave frequencies period increase in unit time reduces the horizontal wave forces of the pile group foundation but also increases the vertical wave force of the pile cap fig 18 f compares the first and second peaks of vertical wave forces of the foundation under different wave heights and periods when the wave heights are the same the wave forces of the first peak increase gradually with the increase of the period while the wave forces of the second peak corresponding to most of the period conditions do not change significantly this shows that the larger the wave period induces the greater vertical wave forces on the foundation however the influence of wave nonlinearity on the vertical wave forces of the foundation is not obvious besides the increase of the wave height can significantly increase the vertical wave forces of the foundation under the same period 4 5 impact actions of waves on the pile group foundation if the water level is close to the bottom of the pile cap and the wave height is large the interaction between waves and the pile group foundation will show strong impact characteristics fig 19 a presents the evolution process of wave forces on the foundation in one wave period the wave height of the test wave is 0 1 m the period is 1 3 s and the water depth is 0 53 m fig 19 a also displays the time history curves of wave surface elevation at the wave facing side on the pile cap i e the left side of the pile cap in fig 19 b1 which is marked by a green arrow it can be seen from fig 19 that when the wave surface elevation at the wave facing side of the pile cap is the same as the static water level i e η 0 fig 19 b1 the wave begins to interact with the pile cap which is also the beginning for the impact of the wave on the pile group foundation with the wave continues to move forward the contact area between the wave and the bottom of the pile cap increases gradually at this time the water particles in the contact area move towards the upper right in the x z plane which leads to a rapid increase for the wave forces f x and f z on the foundation in this process in fig 19 a the first peak of wave force curves when the wave propagates forward to the position of the pile group the wave forces of the foundation decrease sharply due to the blocking effect of the pile group after the wave submerges the pile group the contact area between the wave and the bottom of the pile cap continues to increase until it is in full contact with the bottom of the pile cap fig 16 b2 and the vertical wave force f z of the foundation increases sharply in this process when the wave crest reaches the wave facing side of the pile cap fig 19 b3 the horizontal wave force f x on the foundation reaches the maximum after that when the wave crest reaches the middle of the pile cap fig 19 b4 the uplift force i e f z on the foundation reaches the maximum moreover because the water pressure on the left and right sides of the pile cap is similar and their direction is opposite the horizontal wave forces of the pile cap is close to zero at this time fig 19 b4 with the wave continues to move forward the wave gradually separates from the bottom of the pile cap at this time the water particles in the contact area move to the lower left in the x z plane which causes the wave forces f x and f z on the foundation to decrease gradually in this process and the horizontal wave force of the foundation reaches the negative maximum value at the time as shown in fig 19 b5 after the wave is completely separated from the pile cap the wave only interacts with the pile group when the wave trough reaches the middle of the foundation fig 19 b6 the vertical wave force of the pile group foundation reaches the negative maximum it can also be found from fig 19 a that the wave forces of the foundation fluctuate strongly in the time interval b1 b4 in one wave period which indicates that the wave impact mainly occurs in the time range from the pile cap first contacting with the wave b1 to the wave crest reaching the middle of the foundation b4 5 conclusions this paper presents a calculation model to predict the maximum wave forces of the pile group foundation and carries out the model experiment of the pile group foundation for sea crossing bridge based on this the effects of pile spacings pile slopes conical slopes and wave parameters on wave forces of the pile group foundation were studied moreover the impact process of waves on the pile group foundation was also investigated the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 larger pile spacings reduce the wave forces on the foundation when the wave only acts on the pile group change in pile spacings has a significant influence on the wave forces of the foundation but when the water level is close to or higher than the bottom elevation of the pile cap the effect of pile spacings is greatly weakened as long as the pile cap participates in the interaction between waves and the foundation the wave forces on the pile cap account for a relatively large part of the wave forces on the foundation 2 the increase of the pile slope reduces the wave forces on the foundation but higher water level weakens the effect of the pile slope the change in the pile slope is essentially the variation of the pile group spacing and it can be considered that larger pile slopes are equivalent to larger pile spacings when the direction of the pile inclination is the same as that of wave motion the pile slope mainly affects the shielding effect of tandem piles but the interference effect of side by side piles is mainly changed when the direction of the pile inclination is perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation furthermore the inclined pile can be regarded as the vertical pile when calculating the wave forces of the pile group foundation with inclined pile at high water level the conical slope increases the water blocking area on the pile cap which leads to the increase of wave forces on the foundation 3 when the wave only acts on the pile group the wave forces on the single pile firstly decrease then increase with the increase of frequencies and lower wave frequencies larger periods induce stronger nonlinear factors of the waves when the water level is near the bottom of the pile cap the increase of wave heights enhances the impact of waves on the foundation because the pile cap participates in the interaction between the waves and the foundation in this water level larger wave periods increase the vertical wave forces on the pile cap the wave impact mainly occurs in the time range from the pile cap first contacting with the wave to the wave crest reaching the middle of the foundation when the wave crest reaches the wave facing side of the pile cap the horizontal wave force of the pile group foundation is the largest and the maximum vertical wave forces occur when the wave crest reaches the middle of the pile cap it should be noted that the conclusions are drawn based on some assumptions the waves used in the experiment are unidirectional regular waves while the multi directional irregular waves are more in line with the reality therefore the multi directional irregular wave is worthy to be investigated systematically to attain some more generalizable results and it is meaningful to compare the results of regular waves with that of irregular waves credit authorship contribution statement zhenguo wang

critical role in ocean engineering facilities safety submarine landslides which often occur in sloping seafloor prior et al 1989 yalçiner et al 2003 can cause destructive damage to ocean engineering facilities roesner et al 2019 locat and mienert 2012 locat and lee 2005 therefore it is of great significance to investigate the triggering of submarine landslides and seafloor stability evidence suggests that earthquake is one of the main triggers of submarine landslides hance 2003 brink et al 2009 wu et al 2018 such submarine landslides are often very large in area coverage and enormous in volume zhu et al 2019 haflidason et al 2004 bryn et al 2005 prior and suhayda 1979 these characteristics place demand on large scale seismic seafloor stability analysis nian et al 2019 guo et al 2019 li et al 2017 the south china sea scs is an oil and gas productive area chen et al 2018b li et al 2018 zhu et al 2010 with high and significantly nonuniform seismicity guo et al 2019 liu and wang 2014 which brings risks to ocean engineering facilities zhu et al 2018 analyzed the submarine landslide susceptibility in the scs through a probability process based on a hypothetical slope model representing the typical seafloor morphology in the scs under uniform seismicity li et al 2014 assessed the seafloor stability of the baiyun sag a large scale sag in the scs using the gray clustering method and seismic force was one of the five factors considered which was later expanded to the northern slope of the scs guo et al 2019 liu and wang 2014 considered the nonuniform distribution of seismicity and evaluated the stability of the zhujiang river mouth basin based on limited seismic data further assessment of large scale seismic seafloor stability within the scs taking into consideration earthquake probability and spatial distribution based on comprehensive data is needed to achieve this goal the seafloor soil properties data including physical and mechanical properties are required however due to the limited amount of seafloor soil properties data in the scs estimation of the seafloor soil properties in the unsampled area is needed zhou et al 2019 characterized the stability of an area along the continental shelf of the scs with seafloor soil properties data from a single nearby borehole data from multi sources were utilized in the analysis by zhang and luan 2013 and nian et al 2019 but the spatial variability of seafloor soil properties was not considered li et al 2017 estimated the shear strength of seafloor soil in the liwan gas field within the scs using 3d seismic data but such data are unavailable for other regions of the scs a model for the characterization of seafloor soil properties considering the scarce seafloor soil properties data and the spatial variability of actual seafloor soil properties within the scs is needed for large scale seafloor stability analysis this study aims to analyze the large scale seismic seafloor stability within the scs taking into consideration earthquake probability and spatial distribution of seismicity and seafloor soil properties the framework of this study is illustrated in fig 1 1 high resolution digital elevation model dem for the study area in the scs is constructed 2 pga maps of the study area in the scs under different eps are derived using the chinese probabilistic seismic hazard analysis cpsha method 3 a best fit distribution based kriging method for seafloor soil properties is developed and continuous 3d models for seafloor soil parameters in the scs study area are established 4 an infinite slope model is adopted for large scale seismic seafloor stability analysis validation of the proposed method is conducted using reported seismic induced submarine landslides in the scs 2 basic data 2 1 topography the intense tectonic activity in the scs shaped its topography zhu and lei 2013 zhao et al 2019 the scs is composed of three parts the continental shelf the continental slope and the deep basin liu and wang 2014 zhang and luan 2013 the continental shelf extends from ne to sw with elevation contours mostly parallel to the coastline of china the water depth of the continental shelf is within 0 200m feng and bao 1982 li and jin 1989 developing from the outer shelf the continental slope covers an area of about 230 000 km2 the average slope is 1 3 10 2 2 3 10 2 and the water depth ranges from 200m to 3 400m guo et al 2019 feng and bao 1982 the deep basin covers an area of about 400 000 km2 the morphology of the deep basin is relatively flat as the average slope is 1 10 3 1 3 10 3 with a general depth of 4000m feng and bao 1982 yu et al 2017 the research area of this study ranges from 113 e to 120 e and 19 n to 22 5 n mainly in the continental slope and covering a small part of the continental shelf and the deep basin as shown in fig 2 submarine topography data acquisition relies on multi beam side scan sonar and other methods morlighem et al 2017 shang et al 2019 in this study multi source topography data provided by the gebco compilation group 2019 are adopted to construct the digital elevation model dem via the geographic information system gis both the water depth fig 2 and seafloor gradient fig 3 are processed into 15 15 approximately 400 m 400 m grid size although most of the research area is mildly sloping the slope of some areas is greater than 10 2 2 seismicity earthquake records between 1980 and 2017 in the scs are obtained from the international seismological centre 2019 within a region ranging from 108 e to 122 e and 16 n to 25 n as shown in fig 4 the spatial distribution of earthquakes in the region within the scs is shown to be highly uneven with intense seismic activity in the east part and relatively few earthquake records in the central and west part the east edge of the region along 120 e from 16 n to 23 n is known as the taiwan manila luzon arc this arc is the subduction margin of the eurasian plate to the pacific plate yu et al 2017 sepúlveda et al 2019 which can trigger earthquakes nearby megawati et al 2009 the statistics of the earthquake records in the region are listed in table 1 including a total of 26 818 earthquakes in the 37 year period most of the recorded earthquakes are within m 3 4 and m 4 5 magnitudes 72 2 and 25 22 respectively furthermore the histogram of the earthquakes is provided in fig 5 showing that the most frequently occurring earthquake magnitude is about 3 5 3 8 2 3 seafloor soil properties seafloor soil properties data including unit weight γ and undrained shear strength s u within the scs are collected from existing literature these data are from a total of 50 stations in the research area fig 2 and are listed in detail in the appendix both in situ and laboratory tests are collected the in situ tests mainly contain the cone penetration test cpt the in situ vane shear test vst etc for instance liu 2017 performed cpts at three sites in the scs and derived the s u within 18m from the seafloor for each site zhu et al 2016 utilized in situ vst to obtain the s u of 16 sites in the scs the sampling methods for laboratory tests include gravity coring and box coring and the laboratory tests mainly contain triaxial tests laboratory vst laboratory full flow penetration test etc hsu et al 2018 used a modified gravity coring apparatus to take a 2m length seafloor soil sample in the northeast of scs undrained triaxial tests were carried out to get s u while the γ was also measured zhu et al 2017 used both gravity coring and box coring and performed laboratory vst on the extracted samples 3 ground motion characterization for the south china sea 3 1 basic theory the probabilistic seismic hazards analysis psha method is often used to characterize the random nature of earthquakes this method proposed by cornell in 1968 studies the relationship between the ground motion parameters such as pga and the average return period the potential source and corresponding seismicity levels are taken into account cornell 1968 this method has become a basic theory for seismic engineering design mcguire 1995 2008 budnitz et al 1997 the procedures of psha are exhibited in fig 6 and summarized as follows reiter 1990 1 according to seismotectonics divide the research area into potential seismic source zones psszs with the same seismic probability in each zone 2 based on historical earthquake data determine the recurrence model of earthquakes in each pssz the model conforms to the truncated gutenberg richter g r relation gutenberg and richter 1944 1 lg n a b m where m is the magnitude of earthquakes n is the number of earthquakes with magnitudes equal to or greater than m a and b are regression parameters 3 construct the attenuation relation of ground motion parameter and distance r to predict the ground motion at a specific site the ground motion parameter is considered as a random variable that satisfies the lognormal distribution 4 integrate the influence of all psszs calculate the ep curve versus the ground motion parameter each pssz is required to meet three criteria 1 seismicity is even 2 m satisfies the g r distribution 3 the frequency of earthquakes satisfies the poisson distribution reiter 1990 however when the psha is applied in the scs to characterize the ground motion the satisfaction of all three criteria is difficult most earthquakes occur at the edges of plates which results in the significantly nonuniform spatial distribution of earthquakes therefore only when a pssz is limited to a small range can the seismicity in this pssz be regarded as even yet if the pssz is too small the frequency of earthquakes generally does not satisfy criteria 2 and 3 to resolve the paradox the chinese probabilistic seismic hazard analysis cpsha method people s republic of china national standard prcns 2001 is adopted in this study the cpsha follows the basic framework of the psha while multi level psszs are adopted to consider the nonuniformity of seismicity in the cpsha the entire research area is divided into large psszs and every pssz is divided into subset zones called sub psszs the pssz is used to characterize large scale seismicity satisfying criteria 2 and 3 while the sub pssz is used to characterize small scale seismicity to satisfy criterion 1 the nonuniformity of seismicity in a pssz is described by assigning weight coefficients to sub psszs zhu et al 2020 3 2 mathematical model based on the seismotectonics and historical earthquakes the research area is divided into n k psszs and n t k sub psszs earthquake magnitude m in each pssz satisfies the truncated g r relation in eq 1 m in each pssz is considered as an independent random variable m therefore 2 p m m j 2 exp β m j m 0 1 exp β m u m 0 s h β 2 δ m where p is the probability function β bln10 m u is the maximum of m while m 0 is the minimum the domain of m is discretized into n m k intervals with increments of δm and m j is the center value of the j th interval the annual seismicity satisfies the poisson distribution in each pssz 3 p n a n v n exp v n where n a is the random variable of earthquakes in one year v is the average count of earthquakes per year suppose an earthquake m m j occurs somewhere in the t th sub pssz of the k th pssz the effect of this earthquake on a specific site in terms of the ground motion is characterized as follows 4 p 1 p z z x y k t m j once where z is a threshold of ground motion parameter z such as pga x y kt is the coordinate of the earthquake focus eq 4 is defined by the attenuation relation in step three of the psha 5 lg z a b m j c lg r d exp e m j u σ m where r is the distance between the site and the earthquake focus u is the standard normal variable a b c d and e are regression parameters σ m is the standard deviation of attenuation relation the probability of m m j is 6 p 2 p m j which is defined by eq 2 the probability of the earthquake occurring in x y kt is 7 p 3 p x y k t f k t m j s k t d x d y t 1 n t k f k t m j 1 k 1 2 3 n k where dxdy is the area of the focus s kt is the area of the t th sub pssz of the k th pssz f k t m j is the weight coefficient of the sub psszs in the k th pssz according to the full probability formula in combination with eqs 4 6 and 7 the effect of a random earthquake in the k th pssz on the site is 8 p k 1 tm p z z k once j 1 n m k t 1 n t k t p 1 p 2 p 3 combining eqs 3 and 8 the effect of annual earthquakes in the k th pssz on the site is 9 p k 1 yr p z z k 1 year 1 exp p k 1 tm v k where v k is the annual number of earthquakes in the k th pssz taking all the psszs into account the probability of z z in 1 year at the site considered as the ep in one year is calculated from the independence of seismicity in psszs as follows 10 p z z 1 year 1 k 1 n k 1 p k 1 yr combing eqs 8 10 11 p z z 1 year 1 exp k 1 n k v k j 1 n m k t 1 n t k t p 1 p 2 p 3 combing eqs 2 5 7 and 11 the ep in 1 year at the site is

cumulative probability distribution function of standard normal distribution in practice the ep in a certain number of years is more commonly used than that in one year the transformation relationship between them is 13 p z z y year 1 1 p z z 1 year y where y is the number of years from eqs 12 and 13 the ground motion parameter z can be calculated with a given ep various eps can be selected to meet the needs of the engineering practice furthermore ground motion parameters maps used for engineering design can be obtained under different eps 3 3 pga maps in the south china sea the described cpsha method is adopted to study the pga under various ep in the scs due to the lack of geological survey data in the scs zoning is done using historic earthquake data although not completely ideal the historic earthquake data generally reflect the seismotectonics to an acceptable extent the scs region concerned in this study is zoned into 5 psszs and 12 sub psszs in fig 7 the g r relation and average annual earthquakes v are derived in fig 8 and listed in table 2 for each pssz the seismicity of each pssz generally satisfies the g r relation and the seismicity among the psszs is distinct the v of pssz i is 326 73 while those of other psszs are under 10 which indicates significantly nonuniform seismicity in the scs through eqs 12 and 13 the pga at any sites under a specific ep can be computed since the integration domain in eq 12 are sub psszs which are irregular a simplification is made every sub pssz is divided into a set of small rasters size equal to the resolution of the dem and the integral is replaced with a summation eq 12 is then simplified to 14 p z z 1 year 1 exp k 1 n k v k j 1 n m k 2 exp β k m j m 0 1 exp β k m u k m 0 s h β k 2 δ m t 1 n t k f k t m j s k t i 1

including 63 10 and 2 in 50 years the pga maps under these three different eps are derived using eq 14 and illustrated in fig 9 the spatial range of the pga maps is 109 e to 121 e and 19 n to 24 n slightly wider than the research area fig 2 and covers some part of the china mainland for validation purpose the pga map under 10 ep in 50 years from the prcns 2001 is used for validation and illustrated in fig 10 the good correspondence between the pga of the land areas on the map derived in this study and the same areas on the prcns pga map demonstrates the validity from fig 9 it is obvious that the pga in the region within the scs is significantly nonuniform pga reaches its highest level at the east edge about 120 e westward from the edge pga decreases dramatically until the qiongzhou strait about 110 e 20 n where pga increases again the statistics of pga under various eps are listed in table 3 although pga rises with the reduction of the ep there are considerable areas that maintain low pga despite the variety of eps indicated by the median value which is lower than 100 cm s2 in all three cases the change of ep from 63 to 2 in 50 years shows significant influence on the upper range from 202 cm s2 to 736 cm s2 of the 90 confidence interval nevertheless the lower range remains below 100 cm s2 these findings emphasize the importance of considering the earthquake probability and spatial distribution in the scs for engineering practice 4 three dimensional characterization for seafloor soil properties 4 1 a best fit distribution based kriging method there are various sources of uncertainties in geotechnical engineering practice li et al 2011 cao and wang 2014 jiang et al 2015 therefore the soil properties parameters can be treated as random variables to reflect the uncertainties tang et al 2012 2013 the gaussian distribution has often been thought to be the best fit distribution of soil properties parameters however evidence suggests that the gaussian distribution usually adopted empirically without validation is inappropriate for characterizing the soil properties parameters ji and low 2012 li et al 2015a distributions such as lognormal distribution gumbel distribution and weibull distribution have been suggested to provide a better representation of soil properties parameters li et al 2015b hence it is essential to determine the best fit distribution for relevant soil properties parameters the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 is used here to select the best fit distribution for undrained shear strength s u and unit weight γ data from the scs the aic value is calculated through 15 aic 2 i 1 n ln g x i p q 2 k where g is the probability density function n is the size of the in site data x i is one observation of the in site data p q are the parameters of the candidate distribution k is the number of distribution parameters in practice a series of candidate distributions are selected and the one with minimum aic value is determined as the best fit distribution the truncated normal lognormal truncated gumbel and weibull are chosen as candidate distributions in this study the probability density functions of these distributions are listed in table 4 the kriging interpolation method is known for its strong applicability in geophysics engineering kleijnen 2009 it is used to characterize the spatial correlations of variables and estimate the value of variables in unsampled regions with the best unbiased estimator the values of soil properties parameters including s u and γ are known at surveyed sites the value of an unsampled site is correlated to those nearby surveyed sites without prior knowledge of the parameters before survey chen et al 2018a each parameter at a site is characterized as a variable while the entire research area is treated as a random field qi et al 2016 s u and γ from the scs research area are simulated with independent stationary random fields in this study suppose there are n site surveyed sites with coordinates vectors u i x i y i z i for a stationary random field f u we have 16 e f u c 17 d f u σ 2 where e and d are the mean and variance of the variable c and σ are constants u is the coordinate vector of a site in the area in the kriging framework the parameter value at an unsampled site with coordinate vector u 0 is correlated with surveyed sites nearby 18 f ˆ u 0 i 1 n s i t e λ i f u i where f ˆ is the estimator of the unsampled site and f ˆ is different from f λ i is the weight coefficient which should conform to the unbiased estimator condition 19 e f ˆ u 0 f u 0 0 and the minimum variance of deviation condition 20 d f ˆ u 0 f u 0 δ u 0 where δ is the function of the minimum variance of deviation at the unsampled site combining eqs 16 18 and 19 21 i 1 n s i t e λ i 1 eq 20 can be further expressed as 22 r 11 r 12 r 1 n 1 r 21 r 22 r 2 n 1 r n 1 r n 2 r n n 1 1 1 1 0 λ 1 λ 2 λ n φ r 10 r 20 r n 0 1 where φ is the lagrangian parameter r ij is the semi variogram function defined as 23 r i j 1 2 e f u i f u j 2 in practice the data based empirical semi variogram function r i j e is defined as 24 r i j e 1 2 f u i f u j 2 where f is the observation of f at a site u if n site sites are surveyed n s i t e 2 data pairs r i j e d i j would be obtained and d ij is the distance of site i and j with a regression process of r i j e d i j the semi variogram function is characterized in 25 r r d spherical exponential and gaussian models are commonly used in the regression process and are adopted in this study as well this ordinary kriging method has been considered to achieve optimal unbiased estimation when the parameters can be seen as stationary gaussian random fields normal distribution at a given site however soil properties parameters may not satisfy normal distribution to obtain the optimal unbiased estimator a best fit distribution based three dimensional kriging method is proposed here with the following procedures 1 obtain the surveyed data of relevant parameters 2 recognize the best fit distribution of the data by aic with eq 15 and calculate parameters of the best fit distribution 3 transfer the original data to standard normal space through the equal probability criterion 26 φ u g x where g is the cumulative probability distribution function of the best fit distribution x is the best fit distribution variable of the original data u is the standard normal variable the mapping relations between possible best fit distribution variables and the standard normal variable are derived in table 4 4 conduct ordinary kriging with the transferred data and obtain the estimated data of the entire area in standard normal space 5 transfer the estimated data back to the selected best fit probability space through the equal probability criterion 6 output the data in step 5 and visualize the data in three dimension this method exhibits good flexibility as no assumption of the distribution type for the parameters is required 4 2 three dimensional continuous seafloor soil properties models in the south china sea s u and γ data from a total of 50 surveyed sites scattered in the scs are collected and used in this study details of the data including location longitude latitude mbsf meters below the seafloor and the value of the parameters are listed in the appendix table 5 shows the aic values of s u and γ associated with candidate distributions the best fit distribution for s u is weibull while the best fit distribution for γ is lognormal this finding provides direct evidence that seafloor soil properties parameters may satisfy different distributions choosing gaussian as the best fit distribution without validation may not generally appropriate the fitting ability of various distributions for the original data is visualized in fig 11 following the proposed procedures the three dimensional continuous models of s u and γ are constructed and visualized in fig 12 a and fig 13 a slices at several cross sections 115 e 117 e 20 n 21 5 n of the models are also shown in figs 12 b and fig 13 b in general s u is below 12 kpa within the research area which suggests that seafloor soil is rather soft s u is higher in the northeast part of the research area which also has higher seismicity a reasonable speculation is that the stronger seafloor soil in this region is a result of consolidation after frequent earthquakes γ ranges from 12 kn m3 to 17 kn m3 with higher values in the north part of the research area 5 large scale seismic seafloor stability analysis 5 1 infinite seafloor slope model the limit equilibrium method based infinite slope model is utilized to quantify the stability of the seafloor in this study the mohr coulomb criterion is adopted for the strength of the seafloor soil although the infinite slope model is simple many researchers have suggested that it is appropriate for the analysis of submarine landslides considering submarine slopes are generally mild but large in scale prior and suhayda 1979 ikari et al 2011 baeten et al 2014 the stability of seafloor is quantified using the safety factor fs defined with the sliding force f s and resisting force f τ along the sliding surface as 27 f s f τ f s in this study the impact of earthquakes is treated as quasi static loads based on the forces in fig 14 eq 27 can be expressed as 28 f s min 1 j n f s j min 1 j n s u j sin θ cos θ i 1 j γ i h i cos 2 θ k h i 1 j γ i h i where θ is the gradient of the slope kh is the horizontal seismic coefficient defined as the ratio of pga to gravity acceleration g j is the seafloor soil layer index starting from the seafloor surface and n is the total number of layers γ is the buoyant unit weight the fs j of each seafloor soil layer is calculated and the layer with minimum fs j is recognized as the weak layer governing the fs of the site using eq 28 with the data of s u γ θ and pga maps obtained in the previous sections the fs at any given site in the research area can be calculated hence the seafloor stability maps considering seismicity of the research area within the scs can be obtained 5 2 large scale seismic seafloor stability analysis the scale of submarine landslides is generally large an enormous submarine landslide called the baiyun liwan submarine landslide has been reported in the scs the total area of this slide is up to 35 000 40 000 km2 making it one of the biggest submarine landslides in the world zhu et al 2019 therefore it is essential to analyze the seafloor stability on a large scale combining the seafloor gradient map in section 2 1 the pga maps in section 3 3 and the three dimensional continuous models in section 4 2 the seafloor stability fs maps of the research area under different eps are obtained using eq 28 illustrating the seismic seafloor stability in fig 15 generally fs decreases as ep decrease from 63 to 2 in 50 years moreover the nonuniformity of fs reveals the nonuniformity of seafloor stability under the three seismic levels the stability of the eastern part east of 119 e is much lower than that of the central between 116 5 e and 119 e and western west of 116 5 e parts this is mostly attributed to the nonuniformity of seismicity in the area even under small earthquake with 63 ep in 50 years some areas in the eastern part are unstable fs 1 the fs of the eastern region is around 1 1 5 under earthquakes of 63 ep and is lower than 1 under ep of 10 and 2 indicating that the eastern region is prone to submarine landslides the seismic seafloor stability is much higher in the central region where fs is mostly 5 10 under earthquakes with 63 ep and mostly 3 5 under 10 ep for 2 ep local areas with fs under 1 can occur in the central region the seafloor in the western region is mostly stable under all three ep levels these large scale seafloor stability fs maps under various ep levels can assist the planning and design of engineering structures in the scs the effectiveness of the seafloor stability fs maps is validated using reported landslide data in the scs surveys have mostly been conducted only in areas with identified submarine landslides therefore classifier based validation methods that require both positive failure and negative non failure data such as the receiver operating characteristic curve roc are inappropriate for this cause based on the failure data alone the prediction rate curve can be utilized to validate the fs maps via the area under the curve auc the auc value reflects the prediction accuracy qualitatively an auc value of 0 5 indicates a model with random assignment while an auc value close to 1 denotes a model with strong predictive ability bui et al 2012 the closer the auc value to 1 the better the model is an auc value greater than 0 7 generally suggests a good prediction ability here validation is carried out with surveyed earthquake triggered submarine landslides in the scs reported by wu et al 2018 as shown in fig 16 to achieve this validation the detected submarine landslide areas are divided into cells in the fs maps the size of the cells is equal to the resolution of fs maps and each cell has an fs value then these cells are sorted in ascending order according to their fs the cumulative percentage of cells whose fs lower than every ranking percentage is calculated and plotted as the prediction rate curve to obtain the auc value xu et al 2012 combining figs 15 and 16 the cumulative percentage of submarine landslides versus fs rank for earthquake triggered submarine landslides reported by wu et al 2018 is plotted in fig 17 for the three earthquake ep levels the auc values are 0 76 63 ep in 50 years 0 71 10 ep in 50 years and 0 67 2 ep in 50 years respectively suggesting generally good prediction ability of the fs maps developed in this study the decrease in auc with the decrease of ep is likely attributed to the limited amount seismic and seafloor soil properties data within the scs the potential slide planes of the seafloor inferred from the seismic profile data are also used to validate the effectiveness of the seafloor stability fs maps the seismic profile data was collected during the mgl0908 cruise and its location is depicted in fig 16 zhang et al 2021 the area that mgl0908 covers is inferred to have low seafloor stability based on fig 15 this deduction is supported by the potential slide planes inferred from the seismic profile data shown in fig 18 from fig 18 it can be seen that submarine landslides are well developed in the area which provides a validation of the fs maps 5 3 seafloor stability analysis at specific sites the seismic seafloor stabilities at four specific sites plotted in fig 19 are studied to evaluate the influence of topography seismicity and seafloor soil properties on seismic seafloor stability these sites are distributed from nw to se along the continental slope with a depth range of 420m 1753m and a gradient range of 1 27 5 97 the information of these four sites is listed in table 6 the safety factors fs of these four sites associated with different eps are calculated and plotted in fig 20 fs decreases tremendously as ep decreases from 63 to 2 in 50 years comparison for the fs of sites a and b shows that although sites a and b have the same gradient 1 27 the fs of site a is much lower than that of site b under all eps at ep of 2 in 50 years the fs of site a is below 1 suggesting the failure of the seafloor the difference between sites a and b in seismicity is the main contributor to the difference in seafloor stability comparing the fs of sites a and c although the slope of site c 3 25 is steeper than that of site a 1 27 site c has greater fs under all eps due to the lower seismicity at the site the fs of site a intersects that of site d between ep 63 and 10 in 50 years indicating that under a small earthquake 63 ep in 50 years site a is safer than site d while the opposite applies under a moderate earthquake 10 ep in 50 years this is due to the combined influence of seismicity slope and seafloor soil properties the seismicity at site a is significantly greater than that at site d contributing to the lower fs of site a at lower eps while the greater slope and weaker seafloor soil at site d contribute to the lower fs of site d at higher eps this phenomenon highlights the importance of considering earthquake probability and spatial distribution of seismicity and seafloor soil properties in large scale seismic seafloor stability analysis in the scs in existing traditional studies of regional seafloor stability where this probability and spatial distribution are not considered such a complex phenomenon cannot be reflected 5 4 applicability and limitations the large scale seismic seafloor stability in the scs is quantified through the safety factor fs which is calculated by the pga map and the 3d continuous seafloor soil properties map using the infinite slope model the large scale seafloor stability map in the scs provides a first large scale analysis for offshore structure development that complements more geomorphic geological analyses as those in piedade et al 2018 this approach can be adopted for any region as long as the basic topography seismicity and seafloor soil properties are provided it is widely recognized that seafloor is formed through long term tectonic activities and the information of the activities is reflected in the strata of the seafloor to some extent li et al 2016 piedade et al 2018 with the help of the 3d seismic reflection techniques the profiles of the seafloor strata can be depicted and further information can be interpreted such as weak layers and local discontinuities alves 2015 kamal deen and alves 2013 kamal deen and alves 2014 in this study the potential slide plane is determined by the seafloor layer with the minimum fs while the geological data such as 3d seismic reflection profiles are not considered because available data are not yet sufficient to reconstruct the 3d strata model of the seafloor on such a large scale thus the inferred potential slide plane may not exactly coincide with the true slide plane locally with the accumulation of geotechnical and geological data more influence factors of the seafloor stability can be considered in the proposed method and the fidelity of the model can be further improved also the impact of local offshore facilities such as oil platforms on the seafloor is not considered in this study as the soil structure interaction is not considered the infinite slope model adopted in our study is the simplest model for the characterization of slope stability it may over simplify the nature of earthquake triggered submarine landslides earthquake is a dynamic loading that has complicated effects on the soil such as rate effect cyclic effect etc a series of complex phenomena may occur on the soil during earthquakes including the accumulation of pore pressure the degradation of the soil stiffness and strength zhang and wang 2012 for seafloor soil the dynamic behavior is even more complicated nian et al 2020 the infinite slope model is currently adopted mainly due to the following considerations 1 it has been shown that it is suitable as an initial evaluation for the stability of the seafloor prior and suhayda 1979 ikari et al 2011 baeten et al 2014 especially for the large scale study 2 it requires only two parameters for the seafloor soil s u and γ as it is currently unfeasible to acquire enough data on a large scale for higher fidelity analysis using more sophisticated soil constitutive models wang et al 2014 3 the validations show that the result of large scale seismic stability analysis is generally reasonable under the simple assumptions with the development of offshore in situ testing techniques and accumulation of seafloor property data models with greater fidelity than the infinite slope model can be used in future development of large scale seismic stability analysis in offshore regions 6 conclusions large scale seismic seafloor stability within the south china sea is analyzed in this study taking into consideration earthquake probability and spatial distribution of seismicity and seafloor soil properties to achieve this a high resolution digital elevation model dem for the study region in the scs is constructed pga maps of the study region in the scs under different eps are obtained and continuous 3d models for seafloor soil parameters in the scs study region are established the main findings are listed as follows 1 the distribution of pga is highly uneven in the study region within the scs being relatively weak in the western and central parts while being intense in the eastern part of the region pga under different ep varies dramatically 2 the best fit distributions of s u and γ in the scs study region are weibull distribution and lognormal distribution respectively both distributions are not normal gaussian distribution indicating the necessity of the proposed best fit distribution based three dimensional kriging method 3 the large scale seafloor stability is highly non uniform in the scs study region the scs study region can be divided into three regions as the eastern region central region and western region based on their distinct seafloor stabilities 4 the proposed large scale seafloor stability analysis method shows good prediction performance however it is necessary to obtain more seismic and seafloor soil properties data to further improve the accuracy of the method especially under severe seismic hazards 5 under different eps the contribution of the seafloor stability from various factors including seismicity slope and seafloor soil properties are not the same highlighting the importance of considering earthquake probability and spatial distribution of seismicity and seafloor soil properties in large scale seismic seafloor stability analysis in the scs for the large research area in this study the current pool of seafloor soil properties data is still very limited which restricts the accuracy of the seafloor stability fs map the infinite slope model and quasi static analysis method may over simplify the dynamic nature of seismic induced submarine landslides and more high fidelity analysis may be considered with the accumulation of more data in the region credit authorship contribution statement yuxi wang writing original draft methodology rui

critical role in ocean engineering facilities safety submarine landslides which often occur in sloping seafloor prior et al 1989 yalçiner et al 2003 can cause destructive damage to ocean engineering facilities roesner et al 2019 locat and mienert 2012 locat and lee 2005 therefore it is of great significance to investigate the triggering of submarine landslides and seafloor stability evidence suggests that earthquake is one of the main triggers of submarine landslides hance 2003 brink et al 2009 wu et al 2018 such submarine landslides are often very large in area coverage and enormous in volume zhu et al 2019 haflidason et al 2004 bryn et al 2005 prior and suhayda 1979 these characteristics place demand on large scale seismic seafloor stability analysis nian et al 2019 guo et al 2019 li et al 2017 the south china sea scs is an oil and gas productive area chen et al 2018b li et al 2018 zhu et al 2010 with high and significantly nonuniform seismicity guo et al 2019 liu and wang 2014 which brings risks to ocean engineering facilities zhu et al 2018 analyzed the submarine landslide susceptibility in the scs through a probability process based on a hypothetical slope model representing the typical seafloor morphology in the scs under uniform seismicity li et al 2014 assessed the seafloor stability of the baiyun sag a large scale sag in the scs using the gray clustering method and seismic force was one of the five factors considered which was later expanded to the northern slope of the scs guo et al 2019 liu and wang 2014 considered the nonuniform distribution of seismicity and evaluated the stability of the zhujiang river mouth basin based on limited seismic data further assessment of large scale seismic seafloor stability within the scs taking into consideration earthquake probability and spatial distribution based on comprehensive data is needed to achieve this goal the seafloor soil properties data including physical and mechanical properties are required however due to the limited amount of seafloor soil properties data in the scs estimation of the seafloor soil properties in the unsampled area is needed zhou et al 2019 characterized the stability of an area along the continental shelf of the scs with seafloor soil properties data from a single nearby borehole data from multi sources were utilized in the analysis by zhang and luan 2013 and nian et al 2019 but the spatial variability of seafloor soil properties was not considered li et al 2017 estimated the shear strength of seafloor soil in the liwan gas field within the scs using 3d seismic data but such data are unavailable for other regions of the scs a model for the characterization of seafloor soil properties considering the scarce seafloor soil properties data and the spatial variability of actual seafloor soil properties within the scs is needed for large scale seafloor stability analysis this study aims to analyze the large scale seismic seafloor stability within the scs taking into consideration earthquake probability and spatial distribution of seismicity and seafloor soil properties the framework of this study is illustrated in fig 1 1 high resolution digital elevation model dem for the study area in the scs is constructed 2 pga maps of the study area in the scs under different eps are derived using the chinese probabilistic seismic hazard analysis cpsha method 3 a best fit distribution based kriging method for seafloor soil properties is developed and continuous 3d models for seafloor soil parameters in the scs study area are established 4 an infinite slope model is adopted for large scale seismic seafloor stability analysis validation of the proposed method is conducted using reported seismic induced submarine landslides in the scs 2 basic data 2 1 topography the intense tectonic activity in the scs shaped its topography zhu and lei 2013 zhao et al 2019 the scs is composed of three parts the continental shelf the continental slope and the deep basin liu and wang 2014 zhang and luan 2013 the continental shelf extends from ne to sw with elevation contours mostly parallel to the coastline of china the water depth of the continental shelf is within 0 200m feng and bao 1982 li and jin 1989 developing from the outer shelf the continental slope covers an area of about 230 000 km2 the average slope is 1 3 10 2 2 3 10 2 and the water depth ranges from 200m to 3 400m guo et al 2019 feng and bao 1982 the deep basin covers an area of about 400 000 km2 the morphology of the deep basin is relatively flat as the average slope is 1 10 3 1 3 10 3 with a general depth of 4000m feng and bao 1982 yu et al 2017 the research area of this study ranges from 113 e to 120 e and 19 n to 22 5 n mainly in the continental slope and covering a small part of the continental shelf and the deep basin as shown in fig 2 submarine topography data acquisition relies on multi beam side scan sonar and other methods morlighem et al 2017 shang et al 2019 in this study multi source topography data provided by the gebco compilation group 2019 are adopted to construct the digital elevation model dem via the geographic information system gis both the water depth fig 2 and seafloor gradient fig 3 are processed into 15 15 approximately 400 m 400 m grid size although most of the research area is mildly sloping the slope of some areas is greater than 10 2 2 seismicity earthquake records between 1980 and 2017 in the scs are obtained from the international seismological centre 2019 within a region ranging from 108 e to 122 e and 16 n to 25 n as shown in fig 4 the spatial distribution of earthquakes in the region within the scs is shown to be highly uneven with intense seismic activity in the east part and relatively few earthquake records in the central and west part the east edge of the region along 120 e from 16 n to 23 n is known as the taiwan manila luzon arc this arc is the subduction margin of the eurasian plate to the pacific plate yu et al 2017 sepúlveda et al 2019 which can trigger earthquakes nearby megawati et al 2009 the statistics of the earthquake records in the region are listed in table 1 including a total of 26 818 earthquakes in the 37 year period most of the recorded earthquakes are within m 3 4 and m 4 5 magnitudes 72 2 and 25 22 respectively furthermore the histogram of the earthquakes is provided in fig 5 showing that the most frequently occurring earthquake magnitude is about 3 5 3 8 2 3 seafloor soil properties seafloor soil properties data including unit weight γ and undrained shear strength s u within the scs are collected from existing literature these data are from a total of 50 stations in the research area fig 2 and are listed in detail in the appendix both in situ and laboratory tests are collected the in situ tests mainly contain the cone penetration test cpt the in situ vane shear test vst etc for instance liu 2017 performed cpts at three sites in the scs and derived the s u within 18m from the seafloor for each site zhu et al 2016 utilized in situ vst to obtain the s u of 16 sites in the scs the sampling methods for laboratory tests include gravity coring and box coring and the laboratory tests mainly contain triaxial tests laboratory vst laboratory full flow penetration test etc hsu et al 2018 used a modified gravity coring apparatus to take a 2m length seafloor soil sample in the northeast of scs undrained triaxial tests were carried out to get s u while the γ was also measured zhu et al 2017 used both gravity coring and box coring and performed laboratory vst on the extracted samples 3 ground motion characterization for the south china sea 3 1 basic theory the probabilistic seismic hazards analysis psha method is often used to characterize the random nature of earthquakes this method proposed by cornell in 1968 studies the relationship between the ground motion parameters such as pga and the average return period the potential source and corresponding seismicity levels are taken into account cornell 1968 this method has become a basic theory for seismic engineering design mcguire 1995 2008 budnitz et al 1997 the procedures of psha are exhibited in fig 6 and summarized as follows reiter 1990 1 according to seismotectonics divide the research area into potential seismic source zones psszs with the same seismic probability in each zone 2 based on historical earthquake data determine the recurrence model of earthquakes in each pssz the model conforms to the truncated gutenberg richter g r relation gutenberg and richter 1944 1 lg n a b m where m is the magnitude of earthquakes n is the number of earthquakes with magnitudes equal to or greater than m a and b are regression parameters 3 construct the attenuation relation of ground motion parameter and distance r to predict the ground motion at a specific site the ground motion parameter is considered as a random variable that satisfies the lognormal distribution 4 integrate the influence of all psszs calculate the ep curve versus the ground motion parameter each pssz is required to meet three criteria 1 seismicity is even 2 m satisfies the g r distribution 3 the frequency of earthquakes satisfies the poisson distribution reiter 1990 however when the psha is applied in the scs to characterize the ground motion the satisfaction of all three criteria is difficult most earthquakes occur at the edges of plates which results in the significantly nonuniform spatial distribution of earthquakes therefore only when a pssz is limited to a small range can the seismicity in this pssz be regarded as even yet if the pssz is too small the frequency of earthquakes generally does not satisfy criteria 2 and 3 to resolve the paradox the chinese probabilistic seismic hazard analysis cpsha method people s republic of china national standard prcns 2001 is adopted in this study the cpsha follows the basic framework of the psha while multi level psszs are adopted to consider the nonuniformity of seismicity in the cpsha the entire research area is divided into large psszs and every pssz is divided into subset zones called sub psszs the pssz is used to characterize large scale seismicity satisfying criteria 2 and 3 while the sub pssz is used to characterize small scale seismicity to satisfy criterion 1 the nonuniformity of seismicity in a pssz is described by assigning weight coefficients to sub psszs zhu et al 2020 3 2 mathematical model based on the seismotectonics and historical earthquakes the research area is divided into n k psszs and n t k sub psszs earthquake magnitude m in each pssz satisfies the truncated g r relation in eq 1 m in each pssz is considered as an independent random variable m therefore 2 p m m j 2 exp β m j m 0 1 exp β m u m 0 s h β 2 δ m where p is the probability function β bln10 m u is the maximum of m while m 0 is the minimum the domain of m is discretized into n m k intervals with increments of δm and m j is the center value of the j th interval the annual seismicity satisfies the poisson distribution in each pssz 3 p n a n v n exp v n where n a is the random variable of earthquakes in one year v is the average count of earthquakes per year suppose an earthquake m m j occurs somewhere in the t th sub pssz of the k th pssz the effect of this earthquake on a specific site in terms of the ground motion is characterized as follows 4 p 1 p z z x y k t m j once where z is a threshold of ground motion parameter z such as pga x y kt is the coordinate of the earthquake focus eq 4 is defined by the attenuation relation in step three of the psha 5 lg z a b m j c lg r d exp e m j u σ m where r is the distance between the site and the earthquake focus u is the standard normal variable a b c d and e are regression parameters σ m is the standard deviation of attenuation relation the probability of m m j is 6 p 2 p m j which is defined by eq 2 the probability of the earthquake occurring in x y kt is 7 p 3 p x y k t f k t m j s k t d x d y t 1 n t k f k t m j 1 k 1 2 3 n k where dxdy is the area of the focus s kt is the area of the t th sub pssz of the k th pssz f k t m j is the weight coefficient of the sub psszs in the k th pssz according to the full probability formula in combination with eqs 4 6 and 7 the effect of a random earthquake in the k th pssz on the site is 8 p k 1 tm p z z k once j 1 n m k t 1 n t k t p 1 p 2 p 3 combining eqs 3 and 8 the effect of annual earthquakes in the k th pssz on the site is 9 p k 1 yr p z z k 1 year 1 exp p k 1 tm v k where v k is the annual number of earthquakes in the k th pssz taking all the psszs into account the probability of z z in 1 year at the site considered as the ep in one year is calculated from the independence of seismicity in psszs as follows 10 p z z 1 year 1 k 1 n k 1 p k 1 yr combing eqs 8 10 11 p z z 1 year 1 exp k 1 n k v k j 1 n m k t 1 n t k t p 1 p 2 p 3 combing eqs 2 5 7 and 11 the ep in 1 year at the site is 12 p z z 1 year 1 exp k 1 n k v k j 1 n m k 2 exp β k m j m 0 1 exp β k m u k m 0 s h β k 2 δ m t 1 n t k f k t m j s k t s k t 1 φ lg z a b m j c lg r d exp e m j σ m d x d y where φ denotes the cumulative probability distribution function of standard normal distribution in practice the ep in a certain number of years is more commonly used than that in one year the transformation relationship between them is 13 p z z y year 1 1 p z z 1 year y where y is the number of years from eqs 12 and 13 the ground motion parameter z can be calculated with a given ep various eps can be selected to meet the needs of the engineering practice furthermore ground motion parameters maps used for engineering design can be obtained under different eps 3 3 pga maps in the south china sea the described cpsha method is adopted to study the pga under various ep in the scs due to the lack of geological survey data in the scs zoning is done using historic earthquake data although not completely ideal the historic earthquake data generally reflect the seismotectonics to an acceptable extent the scs region concerned in this study is zoned into 5 psszs and 12 sub psszs in fig 7 the g r relation and average annual earthquakes v are derived in fig 8 and listed in table 2 for each pssz the seismicity of each pssz generally satisfies the g r relation and the seismicity among the psszs is distinct the v of pssz i is 326 73 while those of other psszs are under 10 which indicates significantly nonuniform seismicity in the scs through eqs 12 and 13 the pga at any sites under a specific ep can be computed since the integration domain in eq 12 are sub psszs which are irregular a simplification is made every sub pssz is divided into a set of small rasters size equal to the resolution of the dem and the integral is replaced with a summation eq 12 is then simplified to 14 p z z 1 year 1 exp k 1 n k v k j 1 n m k 2 exp β k m j m 0 1 exp β k m u k m 0 s h β k 2 δ m t 1 n t k f k t m j s k t i 1 n p k t 1 φ lg z a b m j c lg r d exp e m j σ m δ s where δs is the area of a raster n p k t is the total raster number of the t th sub pssz of the k th pssz three eps are adopted in this study including 63 10 and 2 in 50 years the pga maps under these three different eps are derived using eq 14 and illustrated in fig 9 the spatial range of the pga maps is 109 e to 121 e and 19 n to 24 n slightly wider than the research area fig 2 and covers some part of the china mainland for validation purpose the pga map under 10 ep in 50 years from the prcns 2001 is used for validation and illustrated in fig 10 the good correspondence between the pga of the land areas on the map derived in this study and the same areas on the prcns pga map demonstrates the validity from fig 9 it is obvious that the pga in the region within the scs is significantly nonuniform pga reaches its highest level at the east edge about 120 e westward from the edge pga decreases dramatically until the qiongzhou strait about 110 e 20 n where pga increases again the statistics of pga under various eps are listed in table 3 although pga rises with the reduction of the ep there are considerable areas that maintain low pga despite the variety of eps indicated by the median value which is lower than 100 cm s2 in all three cases the change of ep from 63 to 2 in 50 years shows significant influence on the upper range from 202 cm s2 to 736 cm s2 of the 90 confidence interval nevertheless the lower range remains below 100 cm s2 these findings emphasize the importance of considering the earthquake probability and spatial distribution in the scs for engineering practice 4 three dimensional characterization for seafloor soil properties 4 1 a best fit distribution based kriging method there are various sources of uncertainties in geotechnical engineering practice li et al 2011 cao and wang 2014 jiang et al 2015 therefore the soil properties parameters can be treated as random variables to reflect the uncertainties tang et al 2012 2013 the gaussian distribution has often been thought to be the best fit distribution of soil properties parameters however evidence suggests that the gaussian distribution usually adopted empirically without validation is inappropriate for characterizing the soil properties parameters ji and low 2012 li et al 2015a distributions such as lognormal distribution gumbel distribution and weibull distribution have been suggested to provide a better representation of soil properties parameters li et al 2015b hence it is essential to determine the best fit distribution for relevant soil properties parameters the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 is used here to select the best fit distribution for undrained shear strength s u and unit weight γ data from the scs the aic value is calculated through 15 aic 2 i 1 n ln g x i p q 2 k where g is the probability density function n is the size of the in site data x i is one observation of the in site data p q are the parameters of the candidate distribution k is the number of distribution parameters in practice a series of candidate distributions are selected and the one with minimum aic value is determined as the best fit distribution the truncated normal lognormal truncated gumbel and weibull are chosen as candidate distributions in this study the probability density functions of these distributions are listed in table 4 the kriging interpolation method is known for its strong applicability in geophysics engineering kleijnen 2009 it is used to characterize the spatial correlations of variables and estimate the value of variables in unsampled regions with the best unbiased estimator the values of soil properties parameters including s u and γ are known at surveyed sites the value of an unsampled site is correlated to those nearby surveyed sites without prior knowledge of the parameters before survey chen et al 2018a each parameter at a site is characterized as a variable while the entire research area is treated as a random field qi et al 2016 s u and γ from the scs research area are simulated with independent stationary random fields in this study suppose there are n site surveyed sites with coordinates vectors u i x i y i z i for a stationary random field f u we have 16 e f u c 17 d f u σ 2 where e and d are the mean and variance of the variable c and σ are constants u is the coordinate vector of a site in the area in the kriging framework the parameter value at an unsampled site with coordinate vector u 0 is correlated with surveyed sites nearby 18 f ˆ u 0 i 1 n s i t e λ i f u i where f ˆ is the estimator of the unsampled site and f ˆ is different from f λ i is the weight coefficient which should conform to the unbiased estimator condition 19 e f ˆ u 0 f u 0 0 and the minimum variance of deviation condition 20 d f ˆ u 0 f u 0 δ u 0 where δ is the function of the minimum variance of deviation at the unsampled site combining eqs 16 18 and 19 21 i 1 n s i t e λ i 1 eq 20 can be further expressed as 22 r 11 r 12 r 1 n 1 r 21 r 22 r 2 n 1 r n 1 r n 2 r n n 1 1 1 1 0 λ 1 λ 2 λ n φ r 10 r 20 r n 0 1 where φ is the lagrangian parameter r ij is the semi variogram function defined as 23 r i j 1 2 e f u i f u j 2 in practice the data based empirical semi variogram function r i j e is defined as 24 r i j e 1 2 f u i f u j 2 where f is the observation of f at a site u if n site sites are surveyed n s i t e 2 data pairs r i j e d i j would be obtained and d ij is the distance of site i and j with a regression process of r i j e d i j the semi variogram function is characterized in 25 r r d spherical exponential and gaussian models are commonly used in the regression process and are adopted in this study as well this ordinary kriging method has been considered to achieve optimal unbiased estimation when the parameters can be seen as stationary gaussian random fields normal distribution at a given site however soil properties parameters may not satisfy normal distribution to obtain the optimal unbiased estimator a best fit distribution based three dimensional kriging method is proposed here with the following procedures 1 obtain the surveyed data of relevant parameters 2 recognize the best fit distribution of the data by aic with eq 15 and calculate parameters of the best fit distribution 3 transfer the original data to standard normal space through the equal probability criterion 26 φ u g x where g is the cumulative probability distribution function of the best fit distribution x is the best fit distribution variable of the original data u is the standard normal variable the mapping relations between possible best fit distribution variables and the standard normal variable are derived in table 4 4 conduct ordinary kriging with the transferred data and obtain the estimated data of the entire area in standard normal space 5 transfer the estimated data back to the selected best fit probability space through the equal probability criterion 6 output the data in step 5 and visualize the data in three dimension this method exhibits good flexibility as no assumption of the distribution type for the parameters is required 4 2 three dimensional continuous seafloor soil properties models in the south china sea s u and γ data from a total of 50 surveyed sites scattered in the scs are collected and used in this study details of the data including location longitude latitude mbsf meters below the seafloor and the value of the parameters are listed in the appendix table 5 shows the aic values of s u and γ associated with candidate distributions the best fit distribution for s u is weibull while the best fit distribution for γ is lognormal this finding provides direct evidence that seafloor soil properties parameters may satisfy different distributions choosing gaussian as the best fit distribution without validation may not generally appropriate the fitting ability of various distributions for the original data is visualized in fig 11 following the proposed procedures the three dimensional continuous models of s u and γ are constructed and visualized in fig 12 a and fig 13 a slices at several cross sections 115 e 117 e 20 n 21 5 n of the models are also shown in figs 12 b and fig 13 b in general s u is below 12 kpa within the research area which suggests that seafloor soil is rather soft s u is higher in the northeast part of the research area which also has higher seismicity a reasonable speculation is that the stronger seafloor soil in this region is a result of consolidation after frequent earthquakes γ ranges from 12 kn m3 to 17 kn m3 with higher values in the north part of the research area 5 large scale seismic seafloor stability analysis 5 1 infinite seafloor slope model the limit equilibrium method based infinite slope model is utilized to quantify the stability of the seafloor in this study the mohr coulomb criterion is adopted for the strength of the seafloor soil although the infinite slope model is simple many researchers have suggested that it is appropriate for the analysis of submarine landslides considering submarine slopes are generally mild but large in scale prior and suhayda 1979 ikari et al 2011 baeten et al 2014 the stability of seafloor is quantified using the safety factor fs defined with the sliding force f s and resisting force f τ along the sliding surface as 27 f s f τ f s in this study the impact of earthquakes is treated as quasi static loads based on the forces in fig 14 eq 27 can be expressed as 28 f s min 1 j n f s j min 1 j n s u j sin θ cos θ i 1 j γ i h i cos 2 θ k h i 1 j γ i h i where θ is the gradient of the slope kh is the horizontal seismic coefficient defined as the ratio of pga to gravity acceleration g j is the seafloor soil layer index starting from the seafloor surface and n is the total number of layers γ is the buoyant unit weight the fs j of each seafloor soil layer is calculated and the layer with minimum fs j is recognized as the weak layer governing the fs of the site using eq 28 with the data of s u γ θ and pga maps obtained in the previous sections the fs at any given site in the research area can be calculated hence the seafloor stability maps considering seismicity of the research area within the scs can be obtained 5 2 large scale seismic seafloor stability analysis the scale of submarine landslides is generally large an enormous submarine landslide called the baiyun liwan submarine landslide has been reported in the scs the total area of this slide is up to 35 000 40 000 km2 making it one of the biggest submarine landslides in the world zhu et al 2019 therefore it is essential to analyze the seafloor stability on a large scale combining the seafloor gradient map in section 2 1 the pga maps in section 3 3 and the three dimensional continuous models in section 4 2 the seafloor stability fs maps of the research area under different eps are obtained using eq 28 illustrating the seismic seafloor stability in fig 15 generally fs decreases as ep decrease from 63 to 2 in 50 years moreover the nonuniformity of fs reveals the nonuniformity of seafloor stability under the three seismic levels the stability of the eastern part east of 119 e is much lower than that of the central between 116 5 e and 119 e and western west of 116 5 e parts this is mostly attributed to the nonuniformity of seismicity in the area even under small earthquake with 63 ep in 50 years some areas in the eastern part are unstable fs 1 the fs of the eastern region is around 1 1 5 under earthquakes of 63 ep and is lower than 1 under ep of 10 and 2 indicating that the eastern region is prone to submarine landslides the seismic seafloor stability is much higher in the central region where fs is mostly 5 10 under earthquakes with 63 ep and mostly 3 5 under 10 ep for 2 ep local areas with fs under 1 can occur in the central region the seafloor in the western region is mostly stable under all three ep levels these large scale seafloor stability fs maps under various ep levels can assist the planning and design of engineering structures in the scs the effectiveness of the seafloor stability fs maps is validated using reported landslide data in the scs surveys have mostly been conducted only in areas with identified submarine landslides therefore classifier based validation methods that require both positive failure and negative non failure data such as the receiver operating characteristic curve roc are inappropriate for this cause based on the failure data alone the prediction rate curve can be utilized to validate the fs maps via the area under the curve auc the auc value reflects the prediction accuracy qualitatively an auc value of 0 5 indicates a model with random assignment while an auc value close to 1 denotes a model with strong predictive ability bui et al 2012 the closer the auc value to 1 the better the model is an auc value greater than 0 7 generally suggests a good prediction ability here validation is carried out with surveyed earthquake triggered submarine landslides in the scs reported by wu et al 2018 as shown in fig 16 to achieve this validation the detected submarine landslide areas are divided into cells in the fs maps the size of the cells is equal to the resolution of fs maps and each cell has an fs value then these cells are sorted in ascending order according to their fs the cumulative percentage of cells whose fs lower than every ranking percentage is calculated and plotted as the prediction rate curve to obtain the auc value xu et al 2012 combining figs 15 and 16 the cumulative percentage of submarine landslides versus fs rank for earthquake triggered submarine landslides reported by wu et al 2018 is plotted in fig 17 for the three earthquake ep levels the auc values are 0 76 63 ep in 50 years 0 71 10 ep in 50 years and 0 67 2 ep in 50 years respectively suggesting generally good prediction ability of the fs maps developed in this study the decrease in auc with the decrease of ep is likely attributed to the limited amount seismic and seafloor soil properties data within the scs the potential slide planes of the seafloor inferred from the seismic profile data are also used to validate the effectiveness of the seafloor stability fs maps the seismic profile data was collected during the mgl0908 cruise and its location is depicted in fig 16 zhang et al 2021 the area that mgl0908 covers is inferred to have low seafloor stability based on fig 15 this deduction is supported by the potential slide planes inferred from the seismic profile data shown in fig 18 from fig 18 it can be seen that submarine landslides are well developed in the area which provides a validation of the fs maps 5 3 seafloor stability analysis at specific sites the seismic seafloor stabilities at four specific sites plotted in fig 19 are studied to evaluate the influence of topography seismicity and seafloor soil properties on seismic seafloor stability these sites are distributed from nw to se along the continental slope with a depth range of 420m 1753m and a gradient range of 1 27 5 97 the information of these four sites is listed in table 6 the safety factors fs of these four sites associated with different eps are calculated and plotted in fig 20 fs decreases tremendously as ep decreases from 63 to 2 in 50 years comparison for the fs of sites a and b shows that although sites a and b have the same gradient 1 27 the fs of site a is much lower than that of site b under all eps at ep of 2 in 50 years the fs of site a is below 1 suggesting the failure of the seafloor the difference between sites a and b in seismicity is the main contributor to the difference in seafloor stability comparing the fs of sites a and c although the slope of site c 3 25 is steeper than that of site a 1 27 site c has greater fs under all eps due to the lower seismicity at the site the fs of site a intersects that of site d between ep 63 and 10 in 50 years indicating that under a small earthquake 63 ep in 50 years site a is safer than site d while the opposite applies under a moderate earthquake 10 ep in 50 years this is due to the combined influence of seismicity slope and seafloor soil properties the seismicity at site a is significantly greater than that at site d contributing to the lower fs of site a at lower eps while the greater slope and weaker seafloor soil at site d contribute to the lower fs of site d at higher eps this phenomenon highlights the importance of considering earthquake probability and spatial distribution of seismicity and seafloor soil properties in large scale seismic seafloor stability analysis in the scs in existing traditional studies of regional seafloor stability where this probability and spatial distribution are not considered such a complex phenomenon cannot be reflected 5 4 applicability and limitations the large scale seismic seafloor stability in the scs is quantified through the safety factor fs which is calculated by the pga map and the 3d continuous seafloor soil properties map using the infinite slope model the large scale seafloor stability map in the scs provides a first large scale analysis for offshore structure development that complements more geomorphic geological analyses as those in piedade et al 2018 this approach can be adopted for any region as long as the basic topography seismicity and seafloor soil properties are provided it is widely recognized that seafloor is formed through long term tectonic activities and the information of the activities is reflected in the strata of the seafloor to some extent li et al 2016 piedade et al 2018 with the help of the 3d seismic reflection techniques the profiles of the seafloor strata can be depicted and further information can be interpreted such as weak layers and local discontinuities alves 2015 kamal deen and alves 2013 kamal deen and alves 2014 in this study the potential slide plane is determined by the seafloor layer with the minimum fs while the geological data such as 3d seismic reflection profiles are not considered because available data are not yet sufficient to reconstruct the 3d strata model of the seafloor on such a large scale thus the inferred potential slide plane may not exactly coincide with the true slide plane locally with the accumulation of geotechnical and geological data more influence factors of the seafloor stability can be considered in the proposed method and the fidelity of the model can be further improved also the impact of local offshore facilities such as oil platforms on the seafloor is not considered in this study as the soil structure interaction is not considered the infinite slope model adopted in our study is the simplest model for the characterization of slope stability it may over simplify the nature of earthquake triggered submarine landslides earthquake is a dynamic loading that has complicated effects on the soil such as rate effect cyclic effect etc a series of complex phenomena may occur on the soil during earthquakes including the accumulation of pore pressure the degradation of the soil stiffness and strength zhang and wang 2012 for seafloor soil the dynamic behavior is even more complicated nian et al 2020 the infinite slope model is currently adopted mainly due to the following considerations 1 it has been shown that it is suitable as an initial evaluation for the stability of the seafloor prior and suhayda 1979 ikari et al 2011 baeten et al 2014 especially for the large scale study 2 it requires only two parameters for the seafloor soil s u and γ as it is currently unfeasible to acquire enough data on a large scale for higher fidelity analysis using more sophisticated soil constitutive models wang et al 2014 3 the validations show that the result of large scale seismic stability analysis is generally reasonable under the simple assumptions with the development of offshore in situ testing techniques and accumulation of seafloor property data models with greater fidelity than the infinite slope model can be used in future development of large scale seismic stability analysis in offshore regions 6 conclusions large scale seismic seafloor stability within the south china sea is analyzed in this study taking into consideration earthquake probability and spatial distribution of seismicity and seafloor soil properties to achieve this a high resolution digital elevation model dem for the study region in the scs is constructed pga maps of the study region in the scs under different eps are obtained and continuous 3d models for seafloor soil parameters in the scs study region are established the main findings are listed as follows 1 the distribution of pga is highly uneven in the study region within the scs being relatively weak in the western and central parts while being intense in the eastern part of the region pga under different ep varies dramatically 2 the best fit distributions of s u and γ in the scs study region are weibull distribution and lognormal distribution respectively both distributions are not normal gaussian distribution indicating the necessity of the proposed best fit distribution based three dimensional kriging method 3 the large scale seafloor stability is highly non uniform in the scs study region the scs study region can be divided into three regions as the eastern region central region and western region based on their distinct seafloor stabilities 4 the proposed large scale seafloor stability analysis method shows good prediction performance however it is necessary to obtain more seismic and seafloor soil properties data to further improve the accuracy of the method especially under severe seismic hazards 5 under different eps the contribution of the seafloor stability from various factors including seismicity slope and seafloor soil properties are not the same highlighting the importance of considering earthquake probability and spatial distribution of seismicity and seafloor soil properties in large scale seismic seafloor stability analysis in the scs for the large research area in this study the current pool of seafloor soil properties data is still very limited which restricts the accuracy of the seafloor stability fs map the infinite slope model and quasi static analysis method may over simplify the dynamic nature of seismic induced submarine

20453,the waves interacting with open comb type caisson breakwaters was numerically investigated based on a three dimensional numerical model by compiling a modified k ω turbulence model the numerical model can significantly supress nonphysical overestimation of turbulence kinetic energy the numerical model was established in a specific strip of breakwater by introducing a periodic boundary condition to improve computational efficiency the numerical model was validated against analytical and experimental results effects of wave and structural parameters on hydrodynamic performances including wave reflection wave transmission wave forces and energy dissipation were investigated the numerical results suggested the significance of the relative chamber width on hydrodynamic quantities the hydrodynamic interaction including the wave run up on the superstructure and the eddy formation process was illustrated by the time instants of the velocity and dynamic pressure turbulence kinetic energy field and streamline the energy dissipation was mainly due to wave breaking and vortex shedding and hence effectively reduced the wave transmission but had little influence on wave reflection more wave energy went to higher frequency component as incident wave period increased the investigation regarding the phase shift of wave forces acting on rectangular caisson and the side plates proved the advantage in mechanical characteristics of comb type structure keywords comb type caisson wave reflection and transmission wave energy dissipation modified turbulence model flow characteristics 1 introduction gravity caisson breakwaters have been widely used to protect harbours and provide safe harbourages as a new type of caisson breakwater the open comb type caisson breakwater built in da yao bay china see fig 1 has performed well the comb type caisson breakwater consists of uniform comb type caissons and each caisson is composed of a rectangular caisson two thin side plates and a superstructure a three dimensional 3d sketch of a typical comb type caisson breakwater is shown in fig 2 a the front wave chamber width b 1 is formed by the front sections of adjacent rectangular caissons and side plates the rear wave chamber width b 2 is formed by rear sections of adjacent rectangular caissons and side plates with a superstructure on the top the components for one comb type caisson are shown in the upper left of fig 2 b the lengths of the rectangular caisson and one side plate are 2c and a respectively hence the total length of an individual comb type caisson is l 2a 2c shown in fig 2 c compared with traditional gravity caisson breakwaters the main advantages of comb type caisson breakwaters are high stability against structure sliding light weight low demand for foundation bearing capacity and a reduction in the investment expenditure since the rectangular caisson is partially replaced by side plates li et al 2002 niu et al 2003 there is a phase difference between waves reflected from the rectangular caisson and side plates the gap beneath the side plates allows partial tide current passage and thus significantly reduces the flow velocity near the breakwater entrance benefiting navigation safety due to the phase difference and opening area design wave reflection and wave forces acting on the comb type caisson breakwater are smaller than those of traditional gravity caisson breakwaters dong et al 2003 fang et al 2011 waves interacting with comb type structures have been studied using analytical methods based on linear potential theory evans and fernyhough 1995 examined edge waves along a coastal structure that was similar to a comb type structure they paid considerable attention to the edge waves propagating along the coastline and found the exponential decay of edge waves away from the coastline by introducing a periodic boundary condition wang et al 2019 developed an analytical solution for the interactions between oblique waves and comb type caisson breakwaters based on the matched eigenfunction expansion method they proposed formulae for predicting the reflection coefficient and total horizontal wave forces they found that the periodic geometry of breakwaters may give rise to complex wave motion near caissons and multiple reflected waves propagating along different directions experimental and numerical studies on waves interacting with comb type caisson breakwaters have also been carried out li et al 2002 conducted a series of physical model tests to investigate the wave reflection and wave forces acting on comb type caisson breakwaters empirical formulae were proposed to predict the reflection coefficient and wave forces niu et al 2003 reviewed the development and construction of comb type caisson breakwaters and presented a comparison between comb type caissons and vertical wall caissons through physical model tests their results showed that under similar incident wave conditions the performance of comb type caissons in terms of wave reflection and wave forces was better than that of traditional vertical wall caissons fang et al 2010 measured wave forces acting on non open comb type breakwaters under irregular wave conditions through laboratory tests combined with numerical investigations they provided an empirical formula to calculate the transmission coefficient recently zang et al 2018 investigated critical conditions when impulsive wave forces acting on comb type caisson breakwaters occurred they presented a conceptual design for superstructure openings to reduce the impulsive wave force comb type caisson breakwaters hydrodynamic performance including wave reflection transmission and impulsive wave force has been studied in previous investigations however some aspects of comb type caisson breakwaters still need further examination for instance the effects of wave and structural parameters on the hydrodynamic performance and flow characteristics in the vicinity of a structure are not very clear this involves several important physical processes such as turbulence wave breaking wave run up and wave overtopping viscous numerical simulation would be helpful for better understanding of complex physical phenomenon which are not easily obtained by experimental tests and analytical analysis thus in this work a three dimensional viscous numerical wave flume nwt regarding wave interaction with comb type caisson breakwaters was established based on openfoam version openfoam v1712 the volume of fluid vof method was adopted to capture the violent free surface following the study of larsen and fuhrman 2018 a modified k ω turbulence model was employed to simulate the turbulence flow where k is the turbulent kinetic energy density and ω is the specific dissipation rate to reduce the computational efforts a periodic boundary condition was introduced for the nwt section 2 of this paper gives details on the governing equations vof method turbulence model and boundary and initial conditions in section 3 mesh convergence is first examined followed by numerical validations against analytical solutions and available experimental data section 4 describes 3d numerical simulations for studying the hydrodynamic and flow characteristics finally conclusions are offered in section 5 2 model description 2 1 governing equation the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations were adopted to simulate two phase air and water phases incompressible viscous fluid flows the mass and momentum conservations lead to 1 u i t u i u j x j 1 ρ p x i 1 ρ x j μ u i x j u j x i ρ u i u j g i 1 ρ σ κ α α 2 u i x i 0 where i j 1 2 and 3 denote the x y and z directions respectively and ρ u i g i μ and p denote the fluid density mean velocity gravitational acceleration dynamic viscosity and mean pressure respectively the turbulence effects are modelled by the reynolds stress ρ u i u j by employing boussinesq s eddy viscosity assumption we have 3 ρ u i u j 2 μ t s i j 2 3 ρ k δ i j where s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i is the mean rate of the strain tensor μ t is the turbulence viscosity δ i j is the kronecker delta and k 1 2 u i u i is the turbulence kinetic energy the last term on the right hand side of eq 1 represents the surface tension effect σ is the surface tension coefficient with σ 0 074 kg s2 for water at 20 c κ α is the curvature of the interface and α is the volume fraction a brief introduction to the modified turbulence closure model can be found in the appendix 2 2 interface capture the vof method with the interface compression technique weller 2002 is used to capture the interface of the air and water phases the volume fraction α is bounded from 0 to 1 α 0 means a cell is full of air while α 1 means the cell is fully occupied by water any intermediate value of α denotes interface zone of air and water in this study α 0 5 is used to represent the interface the volume fraction α satisfies the following transport equation 4 α t α u i x i α 1 α u i r x i 0 the last term on the left hand of eq 4 is introduced to avoid excessive diffusion of the interface u i r is the compressive velocity and is active only in the free surface interface zone due to the multiplier of α 1 α more details on the interface compression treatments are provided in berberovi et al 2009 with the available volume fraction α the fluid density ρ and viscosity μ are both averaged as follows 5 ρ α ρ w a t e r 1 α ρ a i r 6 μ α μ w a t e r 1 α μ a i r where the water and air subscripts are used to denote the water phase and air phase respectively 2 3 boundary and initial conditions appropriate boundary conditions need to be specified at numerical boundaries the inlet and outlet boundaries the upper atmosphere boundary the bottom boundary and the lateral face boundaries see fig 3 1 inlet and outlet boundaries for the mean flow field the fifth order stokes wave theory is adopted to consider the effect of wave height on hydrodynamic performance the free surface displacement η and mean velocities u i are given on the inlet boundary the fifth order stokes wave theory proposed by skjelbreia and hendrickson 1960 was used in this study the pressure on the inlet and outlet boundaries is set to a zero gradient p x 0 the velocity on the outlet boundary is set to zero u i 0 to avoid undesired secondary wave reflection the relaxation zone technique proposed by jacobsen et al 2012 was adopted which employs predefined relaxation functions in relaxation zones fig 3 thus for φ fluid velocity u x u y and volume fraction α we have 7 φ w φ c o m p u t e d 1 w φ t a r g e t where w is the relaxation function below varying between 0 and 1 8 w χ 1 exp χ 3 5 1 exp 1 1 for χ 3 5 0 1 where χ represents the local coordinate in the relaxation zone the symbol φ c o m p u t e d is the computed value and φ t a r g e t represents the target value turbulence quantities k and ω on the inlet boundary are set to fixed values dirichlet boundary condition the fixed values of k and ω are equal to the initial values of k and ω which are discussed at the end of this section in the normal outlet boundary direction a zero gradient boundary condition neumann boundary condition is imposed for k and ω k x 0 and ω x 0 2 upper atmosphere boundary for outward airflow on the upper atmosphere boundary a zero gradient boundary condition is imposed for fluid velocity i e u i y 0 for inward airflow the normal velocity u y on the upper atmosphere boundary is set as a fixed value the fixed value of u y is obtained from the normal velocity component at the boundary internal cell value the tangential velocity components are set to a fixed value zero i e u x u z 0 the pressure boundary condition on the upper atmosphere boundary is dependent on the airflow direction through the upper atmosphere boundary 9 p b p 0 outward airflow p 0 0 5 u i 2 inward airflow where p b and p 0 denotes the kinematic pressure m2 s2 and the total kinematic pressure on the upper atmosphere boundary respectively u i i x y z is the fluid velocity on the upper atmosphere boundary these atmospheric boundary conditions are a standard setting for outward airflow however for inward airflow a rapid rise in velocity may cause a risk of instability thus the rise in velocity is modified by the reduction in pressure eq 9 driving adverse pressure gradient as inward airflow velocity increases turbulence quantities k and ω on the normal upper atmosphere boundary direction are set as zero gradients k y 0 and ω y 0 using the neumann boundary condition for outward airflow and fixed values using the dirichlet boundary condition for inward flow the fixed k and ω values for inward airflow are equal to the initial k and ω values which are discussed at the end of this section 3 bottom boundary to performing the turbulence model calculations near the wall region the wall function proposed by menter and esch 2001 is applied between a location y p in log law region and solid walls the location y p is chosen to be the first cell node away from the wall and turbulence quantities in the first cell near the bottom are given by the wall function at the solid wall boundaries of the bottom a no slip boundary condition is imposed on the bottom boundary i e u i 0 a zero gradient p y 0 boundary condition is imposed for pressure on the normal bottom boundary direction for wave structure interaction problems the treatment of solid boundary on the structure surface is the same as that of the bottom boundary 4 lateral boundary a periodic boundary condition is imposed on the wave flume lateral boundaries see fig 3 defined as 10 φ 1 φ 2 where φ 1 and φ 2 are physical variables on lateral boundary 1 and lateral boundary 2 of the computational domain respectively by introducing the periodic boundary condition numerical simulations can be carried out in a strip domain corresponding to one unit length of comb type caisson breakwater rather than the whole fluid computational domain since the present breakwater is a periodic structure 5 initial condition the still water state is used as the initial condition which means that the initial velocity condition is u i 0 the initial dynamic pressure p d 0 subtracting the hydrostatic pressure from the total pressure is applied referring to lin and liu 1998a the initial k values for the inlet boundary upper atmosphere boundary and internal field of the computational domain can be calculated by k 1 2 u t 2 with u t 2 5 10 3 c w where c w g tanh k d k is the wave celerity on the inlet boundary the corresponding initial specific dissipation rate is ω ε c u k where the value of ε can be estimated by ε 10 c u ρ k 2 μ 2 4 numerical implementation the rans equations coupled with turbulence transport equations for two immiscible fluids were successively solved within the open source computational fluid dynamics cfd library openfoam v1712 the waves2foam toolbox developed by jacobsen et al 2012 were adopted for wave generation and absorption of boundary conditions for rans equations eq 1 and 2 turbulence transport equations eq a1 and a2 the first order implicit euler scheme was used for the time derivative term of the equations the convection terms of the above equations were discretized by a blend of the central difference scheme and upwind scheme the second order central difference scheme was applied to discretize the diffusion term and other terms more details on the numerical schemes are documented in moukalled et al 2016 the pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso algorithm jasak 1996 holzmann 2017 was adopted to address the pressure velocity coupling problem based on the courant friedrichs lewy cfl criterion an adaptive time step method was used to determine the time step the courant number used in the present study was 0 05 as referred to larsen et al 2018 3 numerical verifications and validations 3 1 mesh convergence tests the problem of wave propagation in a 3d wave flume in the absence of a structure was first considered referring to fig 3 the origin was located at the intersection point of the inlet boundary bottom boundary and lateral wall of the flume the length width and height of nwt were l nwt 13 m w nwt 0 354 m h nwt 0 7 m the relaxation zone lengths adjacent to the inlet and outlet boundaries were both 3 m which would be carefully discussed in following sections a constant water depth d 0 333 m was adopted the incident wave train had a wave height h 0 089 m and a wave period t 1 71 s note that the wave conditions and water depth were the same as those used in the wave action experiments on a comb type caisson breakwater li et al 2002 which were further used for the numerical validations referred to previous studies vanneste and troch 2015 wang et al 2019 tagliafierro et al 2020 the main features of the mesh are related to wave characteristics following the studies of jacobsen et al 2012 waves2foam solver performs best with cell aspect ratio δx δy δz 1 under the circumstance of wave breaking thus this ratio was maintained throughout the analysis of our revised manuscript to conveniently maintain the criterion the initial aspect ratio of background mesh was set to 1 to balance the accuracy of numerical results and computational cost the mesh convergence was performed with respect to three different nonuniform meshes the background mesh δx δy δz 0 02 m of the 3d wave flume is firstly created using the blockmesh tool the refinement region 0 x 13 0 m d 1 25h y d 1 25h 0 z w nwt shown in fig 4 is defined using the toposet tool then different levels of refinement around free surface elevation are obtained with refinemesh tool leading to different cell size the basic parameters of three meshes are listed in table 1 labelled as mesh i ii iii the length of relaxation zone should be related to the wavelength according to the study of jacobsen et al 2012 and afshar 2010 jacobsen et al 2012 has suggested that the relaxation zone can work well with l rz l equal to or larger than 1 where l rz denotes the length of relaxation zone in this study the maximum wave length is l 2 85 m and hence 3m length of the relaxation zone was adopted to make sure l rz l 1 the validity of the relaxation zone for nonlinear waves was examined the wave parameters h 0 089 m and 0 156 m t 1 71 s and l 2 85 m were selected the maximum and minimum wave lengths are 2 85 m and 1 49 m respectively time series of free surface elevation in the relaxation zone x 10 0 10 5 11 0 11 5 and 12 0 m were presented in fig 5 it was found that the waves can be totally absorbed by the relaxation zone for wave interacting with comb type structures the wave steepness of reflected transmitted wave was smaller than that in the validation case of fig 5 thus the relaxation zone with 3 m long was adequate for absorbing waves in this study fig 6 a shows the time series of wave elevations at x 7 m with the three different meshes vertical distribution numerical results of the mean horizontal velocity and pressure at t 14 4 s are shown in fig 6 b and c respectively the position x 7 m was selected because the caisson type structure was placed at x 7 m in the following study we also note that the wave crest reached x 7 m at t 14 4 s fig 6 a shows that the wave elevation time series obtained with mesh ii and mesh iii were in good agreement the coarse mesh i seemed to slightly overpredict the wave crests however for the wave pressure and horizontal velocity vertical distributions fig 6 b and c both suggest notable differences in the mesh i result from those obtained for mesh ii and mesh iii the errors could be attributed to the numerical dissipations from the coarse mesh the comparisons in fig 6 suggested that the present mesh ii and mesh iii densities produced convincing predictions not only for the wave elevation but also the near bed velocity and pressure distributions the simulations were run with a workstation equipped with two intel xeon gold 6230r cpus with 52 physical cores and 128 gb ram two cpus can reach up to 3 8 tflops if the simulation was discretized using mesh iii partition method the total cell number will exceed 10 million which proved to be computationally expensive thus the mesh ii partition method was adopted to further consider the computational efficiency in this case in the refinement region around free surface the cell size in x direction δx was related to the wave length l the cell size in y direction δy was set a value δy h min 9 and the h min was the minimum value of wave height to be simulated the cell size in z direction δz was equal to δy this mesh treatment method can ensure the accuracy of the numerical model where more refined mesh grid can be obtained for the larger wave steepness further refinement in the vicinity of the introduced structure will be examined case by case 3 2 numerical validations we validated the numerical model coupled with the modified turbulence model against analytical and experimental results the 3d numerical wave flume constructed in section 3 1 in the absence of structures was employed to simulate a simple progressive wave train the numerical free surface elevation time series was then validated against analytical and experimental results the model validation was also extended for wave interactions with common coastal structures vertical walls and sloping breakwater finally the full 3d wave interaction with a comb type caisson breakwater was simulated for comparisons with laboratory measurements 3 2 1 long duration wave propagation in the absence of structure the tested case was the same as that considered in section 3 1 the computational conditions included wave height h 0 089 m and wave period t 1 71 s with a constant water depth d 0 333 m the mesh ii partition was adopted fig 7 shows the comparison between analytical and numerical results for the free surface elevation time series the wave height and wave phase were similar to those of the long term wave propagation analytical solution this meant that the present numerical wave flume could accurately predict wave propagation over long durations in fig 8 we compared the free surface elevation time series between the numerical and experimental results liu et al 2018 liu et al 2018 conducted a series of physical model tests to investigate wave propagation for long durations in the absence of structures three wave conditions i e h 0 09 m and t 0 97 s h 0 09 m and t 1 29 s and h 0 12 m and t 1 29 s were adopted with a constant water depth d 0 45 m we observed good agreements at different wave conditions the above validations indicated that the relaxation zone method worked well and the present numerical wave flume can simulate the long term wave train propagation 3 2 2 waves interaction with vertical walls the numerical results for wave dynamic pressure p d acting on the vertical wall were compared with the experimental results from kirca and kabdasli 2009 fig 9 presents a numerical wave flume 2 d sketch for waves acting on the vertical wall the wave train was incident at h 0 10 m and t 0 80 s with a constant water depth d 0 54 m fig 10 shows the dynamic pressure time evolutions at different positions y 0 425 m and 0 50 m where y 0 54 m corresponds to the still water level swl the dynamic pressure was normalised by ρgh good agreements were obtained in terms of the amplitude and dynamic pressure phase 3 2 3 wave breaking on a slope we validated the numerical model with experimental data from spilling breaking waves on a slope ting and kirby 1994 1996 fig 11 presents a layout of the computational domain for simulating spilling breaking waves on a slope a detailed experimental setup is given in ting and kirby 1994 1996 and only important parameters are summarized here a flat region with constant depth d 0 4 m was connected to a region with a constant 1 35 slope the origin was located at a position where the still water depth was d 0 0 38 m see fig 11 the wave height h 0 125 m and wave period t 2 s were adopted from the physical model test observations wave breaking began at x b 6 4 m with d b 0 196 m the velocities and free surface elevations were measured at eight vertical cross sections around the breaking point the data measured at five positions were used for comparisons with numerical results corresponding to one pre breaking position x x x b d b and x 2 286 as well as four positions in the surf zone x 4 397 7 462 13 618 and 16 709 before extracting data the numerical models were run for 60 periods warm up period to achieve a relatively convincing stable situation after reaching the numerical simulation quasi steady state the results presented in fig 12 14 were obtained by averaging an additional 60 periods referring to the mesh convergence test in section 3 1 the computational domain on the flat region was discretized into cells with δ x δ y δ z 0 01 m while the cell size on the slope region was δ x δ y δ z 0 005 m the following notations were adopted in this study η is the instantaneous water surface elevation and η 1 t 0 t η ⅆ t is the time average water surface elevation over one wave period where the overbar is a time average operator fig 12 compares numerical and experimental free surface elevations at x 4 397 7 462 and 13 618 the initial numerical simulation times at different locations matched the time t t 0 in the ting and kirby 1996 experimental results numerical free surface elevations also agreed with those from ting and kirby 1996 note that near the wave crest the increase in numerical free surface elevation was slightly more rapid than the increase in experimental surface elevation fig 13 shows comparisons between numerical and experimental time mean velocity profiles in the x direction u x at x 2 286 x 4 397 x 7 462 x 13 618 and x 16 709 the u x was normalised by the wave celerity c w we observed good agreements between the experimental data and the numerical results for the mean velocity component where the agreements at positions of x 2 286 x 7 462 x 13 618 and x 16 709 were better than those at x 4 397 fig 14 shows a comparison between the nondimensional numerical and experimental time mean turbulence kinetic energy tke k g d 0 5 profiles ting and kirby 1994 did not measure turbulence velocity in the z direction u z in their experiments thus in this study tke was estimated by k 0 75 u x 2 u y 2 scott et al 2005 also used this tke estimation method in the surf zone in addition the experimental time mean tke profile ting and kirby 1994 at pre breaking points x 2 286 was not given but the turbulence velocity component u x 2 profile was provided at x 2 286 k was approximated by k 1 25 u x 2 following the study of scott et al 2005 the agreements between the mean velocity component experimental data and the numerical results were reasonable at x 2 286 x 7 462 x 13 618 and x 16 709 in this section a numerical wave flume coupled with the standard k ω turbulence model abbreviated to nwtkω was also established to simulate spilling breaking waves on a slope where the standard k ω turbulence model was developed by wilcox 1988 comparisons between the tke near the breaking point estimated by the nwtkω and that estimated by the present numerical model with modified k ω turbulence model were plotted in fig 14 it can be seen from fig 14 a tke overestimation occurred near the breaking point x 4 397 however compared with the tke estimated by nwtkw blue dashed dot line in fig 14 a tke overprediction from the present numerical solution red dashed line in fig 14 a was greatly suppressed from the preceding analysis numerical simulations generally captured the major wave characteristics u x and η and turbulence characteristics k under breaking waves 3 2 4 wave interaction with comb type caisson breakwater experimental results from li et al 2002 were used to validate numerical wave flumes for waves interacting with comb type caisson breakwaters li et al 2002 conducted physical model tests to investigate the wave action on comb type caisson breakwater in a wave flume 60 m in length 2 m in width and 1 8 m in depth five comb type caissons made by polymethyl methacrylate were placed in the wave flume shown in fig 15 the water depth d under laboratory conditions was 0 333 m the rectangular caisson model length was fixed at 0 222 m and the distance d s 0 133 m between the side plate and the tank bottom was used three wave gauges wg1 wg2 and wg3 were set to measure the time series of free surface elevation as shown in fig 15 the w1 and wg2 wave gauges were placed at least one wavelength way from the caisson the third wave gauge wg3 was set behind the caisson to measure free surface elevations of transmitted waves the regular wave parameters and dimensions of comb type caisson are illustrated in table 2 and fig 16 based on experimental data li et al 2002 developed the following empirical formula for the wave reflection coefficient c r 11 c r 32 424 b 1 l 2 11 317 b 1 l 1 3686 eq 11 shows that a comb type caisson breakwater wave reflection coefficient is mainly affected by the relative wave chamber width b 1 l with l being the wave length in fig 17 a 3d numerical wave flume is set up to reproduce the experiments the total length of the wave flume was 13 m with a height of 0 70 m the wave flume widths were equal to the caisson structure lengths l w three caisson structure widths l w 0 312 m 0 354 m and 0 40 m were considered for a clear view of the internal wave flume details the right side face relaxation zones and internal meshes were not plotted the still water level was at y 0 333 m a comb type caisson one unit length between cross sections aa and cc of fig 17 was placed between x 7 00 m and x 7 44 m in the 3d numerical wave flume the relaxation zone with 3 m long was adopted for absorbing waves in this study generally fine meshes were distributed in the vicinity of structures and free surface to save computational effort the whole computational mesh including the geometry of comb type caisson δx δy δz 0 02 m was firstly created using the blockmesh tool where 131 vertices and 50 blocks were defined in the dictionary of blockmesh then by using the mesh ii treatment method mesh refinement was conducted along x y and z directions around the free surface elevation see fig 18 further mesh refinement was carried out in the red dotted box computational domain 6 50 m x 8 00 m 0 00 m y 0 600 m and the entire z in the mesh refinement region near the structures the original cell was split into eight elements per cell where the aspect ratio equalled to 1 the total number of cells in fig 18 was 1663982 this was because in that region violent wave deformation and wave breaking take place in this region fig 19 presents comparisons between the experimental and numerical reflection coefficient c r the reflection coefficient was calculated using the method proposed by goda and suzuki 1976 the adopted wave parameters and caisson dimensions were identical to those of the physical model test in table 2 the calculation conditions were as follows three lengths of side plate a 0 044 m 0 067 m and 0 089 m and three front wave chamber widths b 1 0 2 m 0 267 m and 0 333 m with a fixed total wave chamber width b 0 444 m experimental and numerical results for different cases generally agreed well however in fig 19 b near the relative wave chamber width b 1 l 0 218 the c r numerical result was close to the empirical formula curve in li et al 2002 which was quite different from the experimental data fig 19 shows that c r first decreased to a minimum value and then increased with b 1 l the above comparisons suggested that the present numerical model could be used to simulate wave interactions with comb type caisson breakwaters the relative error analysis of reflection coefficient c r between numerical and experimental results were conducted in table 3 it was found that the relative error is relatively small generally but when b 1 l 0 223 the numerical and experimental c r were not vertically aligned where the numerical c r was relatively close to the curves of empirical formula of li et al 2002 and far less than the experimental results in fig 19 b the abnormal value of experimental results in fig 19 b was quite different from those in fig 19 a and fig 19 c at the same value of b 1 l it is assumed that experimental c r at b 1 l 0 223 may be inaccuracy where the value of experimental c r deviates far from curves of empirical formula 4 numerical results and discussions 4 1 wave transmission energy dissipation and reflection coefficients based on potential flow theory previous analytical studies by wang et al 2019 reported that the reflection and transmission coefficient c t was highly dependent on the wave chamber width b 1 l and presented a periodic variation with b 1 l the energy dissipation due to fluid viscosity could not be directly considered as well thus we adopted the present viscous numerical model to quantify the wave transmission and the physical energy dissipation we then used it to consider the effects of wave height on the reflection coefficient with the preceding verified three dimensional viscous numerical model we studied the effects of the relative wave chamber width b 1 l on the wave transmission coefficient c t the wave conditions and numerical setup were the same as those in fig 19 the numerical results in fig 20 a present a small oscillatory variation with b 1 l the transmission coefficient variations with b 1 l decreased significantly compared with the potential predictions by the wang et al 2019 solution this could be attributed to the correct physical dissipation in the present viscous model in addition fig 20 a shows that the difference between the two c t versus b 1 l fitting curves for the two cases with α 0 089 and 0 044 m was no more than 0 15 this suggested that the side plate length had a limited influence on wave transmission the dissipation coefficient c e is defined as follows 12 c e 1 c r 2 c t 2 the influence of the wave chamber width b 1 l on energy dissipation is examined in fig 20 all the energy dissipation coefficients c e with different side plate lengths increased first with b 1 l the largest energy dissipation coefficient was found for the case with a 0 089 m and b 1 l 0 17 where nearly 80 of the incident wave energy was dissipated as the energy dissipation coefficient reached the maximum it decreased slightly with increasing wave chamber width for different side plate lengths the energy dissipation was high when the relative wave chamber width was 0 15 b 1 l 0 25 we also found that the side plate length a influence on the dissipation coefficient was manifested for the moderate wave chamber width b 1 l where the larger side plate length a generally led to higher energy dissipation variations in the transmission coefficient c t versus dimensionless wave height are presented in fig 21 four wave heights h 0 089 m 0 111 m 0 133 m and 0 156 m were adopted where k 0 is the wave number and the wave amplitude a h h 2 we considered four wave periods t 1 04 s fig 21 a b and c 1 27 s fig 21 d e and f 1 49 s fig 21 g h and i and 1 71 s fig 21 j k and l the structural parameters are labelled in the figures the reflection coefficient c r slightly increased when the wave height increased for wave periods t 1 04 s 1 27 s and 1 49 s the decreasing transmission coefficient was more apparent with the increase in wave height compared with the case of wave period t 1 71 s it is noteworthy that the reflection coefficient for a 0 044 m was relatively small compared with c t for a 0 067 m and a 0 089 m 4 2 flow fields near structure a numerical model was employed to further explore flow field characteristics under breaking waves which are difficult to investigate in laboratory experiments a vertical cross section of the computational domain created along cross section bb in the numerical wave flume see fig 22 was obtained to better visualise the velocity and dynamic pressure field spatial distributions and turbulence kinetic energy field as shown in figs 23 25 a typical wave condition of h 0 089 m and t 1 71 s with a constant water depth d 0 333 m was adopted we considered comb type caissons dimensions a 0 067 m b 1 0 267 m b 0 44 m c 0 111 m and d s 0 133 m 4 2 1 velocity and dynamic pressure field spatial distributions the snapshots in the left column of fig 23 a 23 e show the velocity u u x u y u z and dynamic pressure p d fields around the structure within a wave period from t 8 42t to t 9 42t at t 8 42t the incoming wave crest reached the caisson front wall in the right column of each snapshot the 3d free surfaces with streamlines at corresponding times were plotted to better understand the flow field characteristics the free surface is coloured according to the mean velocity magnitude which is defined as u u x 2 u y 2 u z 2 note that u i u i i x y z is the time mean velocity where the overbar was neglected for simplicity in the following section fig 23 a shows that when the wave crest reached the caisson front wall the wave front had deformed and its shape lost its original aspect then the waves impacted the caisson and side plate forming wave run up in addition clockwise vortices were formed in front of the side plate because of wave run up and local backflow generated by waves interacting with the side plate in fig 23 b as the wave continued to propagate a portion of the wave energy impacted the crown wall while beneath the side plate the wave propagated and enters the bay side at the tip of the side plate the velocity was relatively large due to the fluid domain contraction anti clockwise vortices were formed with the energy transfer from the wave to vortices in fig 23 b to fig 23 c the wave started to fall back and caused the local backflow to splash into the front wave chamber the strong local backflow acting on the free surface interface led to a portion of the mixture between air and water phases and a significant amount of air was entrained wave breaking in this region was violent the main vortex tended to disappear and many small vortices were observed in the rear wave chamber in the process from fig 23 c 23 e the wave started to propagate into the front wave chamber again as the wave approached the caisson structure the wave front became almost vertical and a jet of water was projected forwards in the meantime a tube of air was enveloped generating large scale aerated water the wave continued to propagate into the wave chamber and impacted the side plate forming wave run up similar to fig 23 a from the right column of fig 23 a 23 e vortices were formed grown and dissipated as suggested by the streamlines in this way the wave energy was dissipated through wave deformation wave breaking and vortex shedding notably the velocity field values were large just behind the exit of the rear wave chamber x 7 5 m and 7 7 m the relatively large local velocity should arouse attention because it may damage the foundation bed the dynamic pressure p d field is presented in the left column of fig 23 the dynamic pressure p d was normalised by ρgh fig 23 a shows that positive dynamic pressure appeared in the wave crest region and negative dynamic pressure appeared in the wave trough region at the time instants of fig 23 b e positive dynamic pressure near the superstructure and upper part of the side plate was larger than in the other regions this was because at those instants local flow with large velocity was generated by waves interacting with the structure the large dynamic pressure values were distributed near the side plate and superstructure which were weak components in the comb type caisson this should be taken into consideration in side plate and superstructure reinforcement designs another important feature can be observed from fig 23 a d and e with clockwise vortices and fig 23 b and c with anti clockwise vortices vortex generation would cause a severe reduction in dynamic pressure and even lead to negative dynamic pressure 4 2 2 turbulence kinetic energy field spatial distribution regarding turbulence effects in wave interactions with comb type caisson breakwaters snapshots are presented in fig 24 to illustrate nondimensional tke k g d 0 5 fields around the structure fig 24 a shows large tke levels in the wave crest and vortex region in fig 24 b high tke levels were observed at the side plate tip caused by anti clockwise vortices in fig 24 c and d at these instants a region of large tke levels were found inside the wave chamber where wave breaking was violent generally in fig 24 a e high tke levels were first generated in the vicinity of caisson structure due to strong wave breaking and wave impact and then the high tke levels were transported and diffused because of vortex shedding higuera et al 2014 also found that high turbulence levels were distributed around coastal structures and turbulence distribution around free surface and structure was diffused they assumed that high tke levels were transported from the high turbulence region to the low turbulence region due to convection and diffusion another important feature was that significantly high tke levels could be found in the region within half wavelength away from the caisson in other regions the tke values were rather small which suggested that mean flows could be well approximated by nearly potential flow approximation this nearly potential flow approximation was implemented by activating the second max function argument eq a4 in the modified k ω turbulence model the breaking processing had little influence on the nearly potential flow region this also confirmed that wave breaking was a local process with its effects mainly confined around the caisson lin and liu 1998b 4 2 3 wavelet analysis of breaking and non breaking waves wavelet analysis can be used to identify the wave energy distribution at different frequencies a detailed review of wavelet analysis in the context of fluid mechanics can be found in farge 1992 here the commonly used morlet wavelet was adopted to analyse waveform signals fig 25 shows the wavelet transform of the free surface elevation time series at x 7 m breaking wave and x 10 m nonbreaking wave along centreline bb see fig 22 two wave periods t 1 04 s and 1 71 s were considered the real wave frequency f after the wavelet transform was normalised by the incident wave frequency f i the model simulation time t was normalised by the wave period t the contour map was coloured by the wavelet coefficient modulus large values of the wavelet coefficient modulus mean high wave energy while zero coefficient modulus means no wave energy at the corresponding frequency thus on the basis of these considerations fig 25 a and c showed that the breaking wave energy was mainly contained around the incident wave frequency and that a small portion of wave energy was distributed around multiple incident wave frequencies i e f f i 2 3 and 4 comparing fig 25 b with fig 25 d the transmission wave energy of long period wave t 1 71 s was larger than that of t 1 04 s as the wave period increased more of the wave energy went to higher frequencies 4 3 wave forces on comb type caisson the wave force on a comb type caisson was evaluated by integrating pressure p and viscous stress tensor τ i j 2 μ μ t s i j over the surface of the structure 13 f j ω j p j τ i j ⅆ γ j where γ j is the surface area of the structure the normal directions of structure surface are plotted in fig 26 where the normal direction of surfaces along x axis are coloured with red and the normal direction of surfaces along z axis are coloured with blue the normal direction of rest structure surfaces along y axis coloured with grey in fig 27 the time evolution of the wave force acting on the comb type caisson in the x direction f x is presented four wave heights h 0 089 m 0 111 m 0 133 m and 0 156 m and two wave periods t 1 71 s and 1 49 s were considered the caisson width was l 0 356 m other comb type caisson dimensions were a 0 067 m b 1 0 267 m b 0 45 m c 0 11 m and d s 0 13 m to compare different wave heights f x was normalised by f 0 where f 0 ρ g h 0 l d and h 0 0 122 m were the average of the four wave heights dimensionless wave force f x f 0 amplitudes acting on the comb type caisson increased when wave height increased for t 1 49 s and t 1 71 s from additional numerical simulations we found that overtopping discharge increased with increasing wave height more overtopping discharge resulted in more wave energy more water mass directly acting on the front face of the comb type caisson this behaviour likely indicated a larger f x f 0 amplitude park et al 2017 also observed this phenomenon when they investigated the horizontal and vertical wave forces on an elevated coastal structure comparing fig 27 a with fig 27 b the dimensionless wave force f x f 0 amplitudes for t 1 49 s were smaller than those of t 1 71 s the f x f 0 time evolution for different wave heights had a slight phase difference this slight discrepancy might have been mainly induced by wave breaking and wave overtopping discharge at different wave heights two side plates are the weak components of comb type caissons under wave actions the wave force in the x direction f xc acting on the rectangular caisson and wave force f xsp in the x direction acting on two side plates fig 28 a were presented at different side plate lengths i e a 0 044 m 0 067 m and 0 089 m f xc and f xsp were normalised by f 0 the dimensionless f xc and f x s p amplitudes changed slightly with the side plate length fig 28 a shows that the maximum f x c and maximum f x s p did not reach the peaks simultaneously which had a time difference δt this was the main reason that the comb type caisson breakwater could effectively reduce the wave force compared with vertical wall breakwater the comparison in terms of time phase between total wave force in the x direction f x the y direction f y and the z direction f z were presented in fig 28 b the time phase different δt between f x f y and f z was approximately equal to 0 but the value of total force f y and f z approached to 0 which meant the stability of structure was good under normally incident wave condition 5 conclusion in this study a 3d numerical model based on openfoam was developed to simulate waves interacting with open comb type caisson breakwaters the numerical flume using the modified k ω turbulence model enabled nearly constant wave propagation over a long duration the periodic boundary condition was implemented to significantly save computational effort the numerical model was validated by comparing several numerical solutions with analytical solutions and experimental data and we confirmed that the numerical results were in good agreement with the analytical and experimental results numerical simulations were conducted to understand flow characteristics near caisson structures the effects of wave and structural parameters on wave reflection wave transmission wave energy dissipation and wave force were examined the main conclusions are given as follows hydrodynamic performance of open comb type caisson characterized based on the reflection coefficient and energy dissipation coefficient was highly dependent on the relative wave chamber width b 1 l however the transmission coefficient presented a small oscillatory variation with b 1 l we found that energy dissipation reached up to 80 of the total wave energy with side plate lengths a 0 089 m and b 1 l 0 17 and energy dissipation was high when the relative wave chamber width 0 15 b 1 l 0 25 the side plate length had a limited influence on the wave transmission with increasing wave height the reflection coefficient decreased the dimensionless horizontal wave force amplitude on the two side plates changed slightly with the side plate length the maximum wave forces acting on the caisson and side plates in the x direction did not occur simultaneously due to the wave phase difference between the side plate and front wall of a rectangular caisson the phase shift of wave forces between rectangular caisson and the side plates is the main reason of the advantage in mechanical characteristics of comb type structure for different period incident waves the dimensionless wave force amplitude acting on the caisson in the x direction increased when the wave height increased in the region within half a wave length away from the caisson structure high tke levels were observed due to wave breaking and vortex shedding the wave breaking inside the wave chamber and vortices around the caisson structure were the primary ways to dissipate wave energy vortex generation caused a severe reduction in dynamic pressure the large dynamic pressure levels were distributed near the side plate and superstructure which were the weak components in the comb type caisson this study provides a better understanding of comb type caisson breakwater hydrodynamic performance the numerical model can also be applied for other periodic arrays of equally spaced identical caissons credit authorship contribution statement xin yu wang

202113032 appendix brief introduction of modified turbulence model in the numerical simulations of waves interacting with coastal structures using the rans model coupled with various two equation turbulence closure models there has been a tendency to overpredict turbulence levels in regions of nearly potential flow prior wave breaking and post breaking mayer and madsen 2000 overpredicted turbulence can cause significant wave height decay this implied that cfd models coupled with commonly used two equation turbulence closure models e g standard k ω sst shear stress transport k ω nonlinear k ϵ and rng renormalized group k ϵ models could not accurately simulate long term wave propagation brown et al 2016 devolder et al 2017 by comparing numerical results with the experimental data from ting and kirby 1994 lin and liu 1998a also found that turbulence levels were overpredicted which led to wave height decay when they investigated breaking waves in the surf zone of a slope to eliminate this phenomenon mayer and madsen 2000 made an ad hoc modification to the production term of the standard k ω turbulence model wilcox 1988 by substituting the mean rotation rate into the mean strain rate however they found that the modified model could not be considered a fundamentally available solution owing to nonconformity with boussinesq s eddy viscosity approximation wilcox 2006 added a limiting function for ω into the standard k ω closure model which limits the resulting eddy viscosity in regions where turbulence production exceeded the dissipation however the problem of turbulence tke unphysical exponential growth and eddy viscosity was not solved to solve this long standing problem larsen and fuhrman 2018 introduced a limiting function with respect to ω into a commonly used two equation turbulence model the limiting function was related to the mean rotation and strain rates of the fluid which are discussed later through a comparison between numerical and experimental results they found that the numerical model coupled with the modified turbulence closure model could avoid unphysical exponential growth thus the wave height decay phenomenon was suppressed larsen 2018 have released the codes of the formally stabilized turbulence model for openfoam 5 0 foamextened 3 1 and openfoam v1712 in the github repository where four two equation turbulence models were included for openfoam v1712 namely the formally stabilized versions of k ω sst k ω standard k ε and rng k ε turbulence models following larsen and fuhrman 2018 a brief introduction to the modification of the standard k ω turbulence model is given as follows in the study of larsen and fuhrman 2018 the generalized k ω turbulence model including the advection equations of the turbulent kinetic energy density k 1 2 u i u i and the specific dissipation ratio ω reads a1 ρ k t u j ρ k x j ρ p k ρ p b ρ c μ k ω x j μ ρ σ k k ω k x j a2 ρ ω t u j ρ ω x j ρ p ω ρ β ω 2 ρ σ d ω k x j ω x j x j μ ρ σ ω k ω ω x j where u j and u i are the mean and fluctuation components of velocity respectively x j are the cartesian coordinates μ ρν is the dynamic molecular viscosity ν is the kinematic viscosity ρ is the density t is the time and a3 τ i j u i u j 2 ν t s i j 2 3 ρ δ i j is the reynolds stress tensor δ ij is the kronecker delta a4 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i is the mean strain rate tensor and the eddy viscosity ν t is defined as a5 ν t k ω the shear production term for k is p k χ 0 ν t with χ 0 2 s i j s i j similarly the buoyancy production for k is formulated as p b p b ν t and p b α b g i ρ ρ x i where g 1 g 2 g 3 0 0 g is gravitational acceleration the production of ω is taken as a6 p ω γ ω k ω ω p k γ ω ω χ 0 two utility variables ω and ω are introduced rather than the usual one variable ω the model coefficient values are set to β 0 0708 γ 0 52 c u 0 09 σ k 0 6 σ ω 0 5 α b 1 36 and σ d 0 125 h k x j ω x j where h is the heaviside step function which takes a value of unity if the argument is positive and zero otherwise to solve the overestimation of k and ν t for the original k ω turbulence model a limiter function involving two variables ω and ω for the specific dissipation rate ω was proposed by larsen and fuhrman 2018 as follows a7 ω max ω λ 1 p 0 p b c μ a8 ω max ω λ 2 β c μ γ χ 0 χ ω ω where χ ω 2 ω i j ω i j and ω i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i is the mean rotation rate tensor λ 2 1 is an additional stress limiter coefficient note that if λ 1 λ 2 0 the generalized expression form of the modified k ω turbulence model becomes equivalent to the standard k ω turbulence model of wilcox 1988 whereas the turbulence model becomes equivalent to the wilcox 2006 model with λ 2 0 hence it is easy to implement a generalized version of k ω turbulence model to consider additional freedom by introducing a limiter function following larsen and fuhrman 2018 λ 1 0 and λ 2 0 05 are adopted in this study moreover in a region of nearly potential flow the second argument in the max function eq a8 becomes active because χ ω χ 0 in complex sheared flow regions the first argument in the max function eq a8 is active where χ ω and χ 0 are in the same order of magnitude 
20453,the waves interacting with open comb type caisson breakwaters was numerically investigated based on a three dimensional numerical model by compiling a modified k ω turbulence model the numerical model can significantly supress nonphysical overestimation of turbulence kinetic energy the numerical model was established in a specific strip of breakwater by introducing a periodic boundary condition to improve computational efficiency the numerical model was validated against analytical and experimental results effects of wave and structural parameters on hydrodynamic performances including wave reflection wave transmission wave forces and energy dissipation were investigated the numerical results suggested the significance of the relative chamber width on hydrodynamic quantities the hydrodynamic interaction including the wave run up on the superstructure and the eddy formation process was illustrated by the time instants of the velocity and dynamic pressure turbulence kinetic energy field and streamline the energy dissipation was mainly due to wave breaking and vortex shedding and hence effectively reduced the wave transmission but had little influence on wave reflection more wave energy went to higher frequency component as incident wave period increased the investigation regarding the phase shift of wave forces acting on rectangular caisson and the side plates proved the advantage in mechanical characteristics of comb type structure keywords comb type caisson wave reflection and transmission wave energy dissipation modified turbulence model flow characteristics 1 introduction gravity caisson breakwaters have been widely used to protect harbours and provide safe harbourages as a new type of caisson breakwater the open comb type caisson breakwater built in da yao bay china see fig 1 has performed well the comb type caisson breakwater consists of uniform comb type caissons and each caisson is composed of a rectangular caisson two thin side plates and a superstructure a three dimensional 3d sketch of a typical comb type caisson breakwater is shown in fig 2 a the front wave chamber width b 1 is formed by the front sections of adjacent rectangular caissons and side plates the rear wave chamber width b 2 is formed by rear sections of adjacent rectangular caissons and side plates with a superstructure on the top the components for one comb type caisson are shown in the upper left of fig 2 b the lengths of the rectangular caisson and one side plate are 2c and a respectively hence the total length of an individual comb type caisson is l 2a 2c shown in fig 2 c compared with traditional gravity caisson breakwaters the main advantages of comb type caisson breakwaters are high stability against structure sliding light weight low demand for foundation bearing capacity and a reduction in the investment expenditure since the rectangular caisson is partially replaced by side plates li et al 2002 niu et al 2003 there is a phase difference between waves reflected from the rectangular caisson and side plates the gap beneath the side plates allows partial tide current passage and thus significantly reduces the flow velocity near the breakwater entrance benefiting navigation safety due to the phase difference and opening area design wave reflection and wave forces acting on the comb type caisson breakwater are smaller than those of traditional gravity caisson breakwaters dong et al 2003 fang et al 2011 waves interacting with comb type structures have been studied using analytical methods based on linear potential theory evans and fernyhough 1995 examined edge waves along a coastal structure that was similar to a comb type structure they paid considerable attention to the edge waves propagating along the coastline and found the exponential decay of edge waves away from the coastline by introducing a periodic boundary condition wang et al 2019 developed an analytical solution for the interactions between oblique waves and comb type caisson breakwaters based on the matched eigenfunction expansion method they proposed formulae for predicting the reflection coefficient and total horizontal wave forces they found that the periodic geometry of breakwaters may give rise to complex wave motion near caissons and multiple reflected waves propagating along different directions experimental and numerical studies on waves interacting with comb type caisson breakwaters have also been carried out li et al 2002 conducted a series of physical model tests to investigate the wave reflection and wave forces acting on comb type caisson breakwaters empirical formulae were proposed to predict the reflection coefficient and wave forces niu et al 2003 reviewed the development and construction of comb type caisson breakwaters and presented a comparison between comb type caissons and vertical wall caissons through physical model tests their results showed that under similar incident wave conditions the performance of comb type caissons in terms of wave reflection and wave forces was better than that of traditional vertical wall caissons fang et al 2010 measured wave forces acting on non open comb type breakwaters under irregular wave conditions through laboratory tests combined with numerical investigations they provided an empirical formula to calculate the transmission coefficient recently zang et al 2018 investigated critical conditions when impulsive wave forces acting on comb type caisson breakwaters occurred they presented a conceptual design for superstructure openings to reduce the impulsive wave force comb type caisson breakwaters hydrodynamic performance including wave reflection transmission and impulsive wave force has been studied in previous investigations however some aspects of comb type caisson breakwaters still need further examination for instance the effects of wave and structural parameters on the hydrodynamic performance and flow characteristics in the vicinity of a structure are not very clear this involves several important physical processes such as turbulence wave breaking wave run up and wave overtopping viscous numerical simulation would be helpful for better understanding of complex physical phenomenon which are not easily obtained by experimental tests and analytical analysis thus in this work a three dimensional viscous numerical wave flume nwt regarding wave interaction with comb type caisson breakwaters was established based on openfoam version openfoam v1712 the volume of fluid vof method was adopted to capture the violent free surface following the study of larsen and fuhrman 2018 a modified k ω turbulence model was employed to simulate the turbulence flow where k is the turbulent kinetic energy density and ω is the specific dissipation rate to reduce the computational efforts a periodic boundary condition was introduced for the nwt section 2 of this paper gives details on the governing equations vof method turbulence model and boundary and initial conditions in section 3 mesh convergence is first examined followed by numerical validations against analytical solutions and available experimental data section 4 describes 3d numerical simulations for studying the hydrodynamic and flow characteristics finally conclusions are offered in section 5 2 model description 2 1 governing equation the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations were adopted to simulate two phase air and water phases incompressible viscous fluid flows the mass and momentum conservations lead to 1 u i t u i u j x j 1 ρ p x i 1 ρ x j μ u i x j u j x i ρ u i u j g i 1 ρ σ κ α α 2 u i x i 0 where i j 1 2 and 3 denote the x y and z directions respectively and ρ u i g i μ and p denote the fluid density mean velocity gravitational acceleration dynamic viscosity and mean pressure respectively the turbulence effects are modelled by the reynolds stress ρ u i u j by employing boussinesq s eddy viscosity assumption we have 3 ρ u i u j 2 μ t s i j 2 3 ρ k δ i j where s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i is the mean rate of the strain tensor μ t is the turbulence viscosity δ i j is the kronecker delta and k 1 2 u i u i is the turbulence kinetic energy the last term on the right hand side of eq 1 represents the surface tension effect σ is the surface tension coefficient with σ 0 074 kg s2 for water at 20 c κ α is the curvature of the interface and α is the volume fraction a brief introduction to the modified turbulence closure model can be found in the appendix 2 2 interface capture the vof method with the interface compression technique weller 2002 is used to capture the interface of the air and water phases the volume fraction α is bounded from 0 to 1 α 0 means a cell is full of air while α 1 means the cell is fully occupied by water any intermediate value of α denotes interface zone of air and water in this study α 0 5 is used to represent the interface the volume fraction α satisfies the following transport equation 4 α t α u i x i α 1 α u i r x i 0 the last term on the left hand of eq 4 is introduced to avoid excessive diffusion of the interface u i r is the compressive velocity and is active only in the free surface interface zone due to the multiplier of α 1 α more details on the interface compression treatments are provided in berberovi et al 2009 with the available volume fraction α the fluid density ρ and viscosity μ are both averaged as follows 5 ρ α ρ w a t e r 1 α ρ a i r 6 μ α μ w a t e r 1 α μ a i r where the water and air subscripts are used to denote the water phase and air phase respectively 2 3 boundary and initial conditions appropriate boundary conditions need to be specified at numerical boundaries the inlet and outlet boundaries the upper atmosphere boundary the bottom boundary and the lateral face boundaries see fig 3 1 inlet and outlet boundaries for the mean flow field the fifth order stokes wave theory is adopted to consider the effect of wave height on hydrodynamic performance the free surface displacement η and mean velocities u i are given on the inlet boundary the fifth order stokes wave theory proposed by skjelbreia and hendrickson 1960 was used in this study the pressure on the inlet and outlet boundaries is set to a zero gradient p x 0 the velocity on the outlet boundary is set to zero u i 0 to avoid undesired secondary wave reflection the relaxation zone technique proposed by jacobsen et al 2012 was adopted which employs predefined relaxation functions in relaxation zones fig 3 thus for φ fluid velocity u x u y and volume fraction α we have 7 φ w φ c o m p u t e d 1 w φ t a r g e t where w is the relaxation function below varying between 0 and 1 8 w χ 1 exp χ 3 5 1 exp 1 1 for χ 3 5 0 1 where χ represents the local coordinate in the relaxation zone the symbol φ c o m p u t e d is the computed value and φ t a r g e t represents the target value turbulence quantities k and ω on the inlet boundary are set to fixed values dirichlet boundary condition the fixed values of k and ω are equal to the initial values of k and ω which are discussed at the end of this section in the normal outlet boundary direction a zero gradient boundary condition neumann boundary condition is imposed for k and ω k x 0 and ω x 0 2 upper atmosphere boundary for outward airflow on the upper atmosphere boundary a zero gradient boundary condition is imposed for fluid velocity i e u i y 0 for inward airflow the normal velocity u y on the upper atmosphere boundary is set as a fixed value the fixed value of u y is obtained from the normal velocity component at the boundary internal cell value the tangential velocity components are set to a fixed value zero i e u x u z 0 the pressure boundary condition on the upper atmosphere boundary is dependent on the airflow direction through the upper atmosphere boundary 9 p b p 0 outward airflow p 0 0 5 u i 2 inward airflow where p b and p 0 denotes the kinematic pressure m2 s2 and the total kinematic pressure on the upper atmosphere boundary respectively u i i x y z is the fluid velocity on the upper atmosphere boundary these atmospheric boundary conditions are a standard setting for outward airflow however for inward airflow a rapid rise in velocity may cause a risk of instability thus the rise in velocity is modified by the reduction in pressure eq 9 driving adverse pressure gradient as inward airflow velocity increases turbulence quantities k and ω on the normal upper atmosphere boundary direction are set as zero gradients k y 0 and ω y 0 using the neumann boundary condition for outward airflow and fixed values using the dirichlet boundary condition for inward flow the fixed k and ω values for inward airflow are equal to the initial k and ω values which are discussed at the end of this section 3 bottom boundary to performing the turbulence model calculations near the wall region the wall function proposed by menter and esch 2001 is applied between a location y p in log law region and solid walls the location y p is chosen to be the first cell node away from the wall and turbulence quantities in the first cell near the bottom are given by the wall function at the solid wall boundaries of the bottom a no slip boundary condition is imposed on the bottom boundary i e u i 0 a zero gradient p y 0 boundary condition is imposed for pressure on the normal bottom boundary direction for wave structure interaction problems the treatment of solid boundary on the structure surface is the same as that of the bottom boundary 4 lateral boundary a periodic boundary condition is imposed on the wave flume lateral boundaries see fig 3 defined as 10 φ 1 φ 2 where φ 1 and φ 2 are physical variables on lateral boundary 1 and lateral boundary 2 of the computational domain respectively by introducing the periodic boundary condition numerical simulations can be carried out in a strip domain corresponding to one unit length of comb type caisson breakwater rather than the whole fluid computational domain since the present breakwater is a periodic structure 5 initial condition the still water state is used as the initial condition which means that the initial velocity condition is u i 0 the initial dynamic pressure p d 0 subtracting the hydrostatic pressure from the total pressure is applied referring to lin and liu 1998a the initial k values for the inlet boundary upper atmosphere boundary and internal field of the computational domain can be calculated by k 1 2 u t 2 with u t 2 5 10 3 c w where c w g tanh k d k is the wave celerity on the inlet boundary the corresponding initial specific dissipation rate is ω ε c u k where the value of ε can be estimated by ε 10 c u ρ k 2 μ 2 4 numerical implementation the rans equations coupled with turbulence transport equations for two immiscible fluids were successively solved within the open source computational fluid dynamics cfd library openfoam v1712 the waves2foam toolbox developed by jacobsen et al 2012 were adopted for wave generation and absorption of boundary conditions for rans equations eq 1 and 2 turbulence transport equations eq a1 and a2 the first order implicit euler scheme was used for the time derivative term of the equations the convection terms of the above equations were discretized by a blend of the central difference scheme and upwind scheme the second order central difference scheme was applied to discretize the diffusion term and other terms more details on the numerical schemes are documented in moukalled et al 2016 the pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso algorithm jasak 1996 holzmann 2017 was adopted to address the pressure velocity coupling problem based on the courant friedrichs lewy cfl criterion an adaptive time step method was used to determine the time step the courant number used in the present study was 0 05 as referred to larsen et al 2018 3 numerical verifications and validations 3 1 mesh convergence tests the problem of wave propagation in a 3d wave flume in the absence of a structure was first considered referring to fig 3 the origin was located at the intersection point of the inlet boundary bottom boundary and lateral wall of the flume the length width and height of nwt were l nwt 13 m w nwt 0 354 m h nwt 0 7 m the relaxation zone lengths adjacent to the inlet and outlet boundaries were both 3 m which would be carefully discussed in following sections a constant water depth d 0 333 m was adopted the incident wave train had a wave height h 0 089 m and a wave period t 1 71 s note that the wave conditions and water depth were the same as those used in the wave action experiments on a comb type caisson breakwater li et al 2002 which were further used for the numerical validations referred to previous studies vanneste and troch 2015 wang et al 2019 tagliafierro et al 2020 the main features of the mesh are related to wave characteristics following the studies of jacobsen et al 2012 waves2foam solver performs best with cell aspect ratio δx δy δz 1 under the circumstance of wave breaking thus this ratio was maintained throughout the analysis of our revised manuscript to conveniently maintain the criterion the initial aspect ratio of background mesh was set to 1 to balance the accuracy of numerical results and computational cost the mesh convergence was performed with respect to three different nonuniform meshes the background mesh δx δy δz 0 02 m of the 3d wave flume is firstly created using the blockmesh tool the refinement region 0 x 13 0 m d 1 25h y d 1 25h 0 z w nwt shown in fig 4 is defined using the toposet tool then different levels of refinement around free surface elevation are obtained with refinemesh tool leading to different cell size the basic parameters of three meshes are listed in table 1 labelled as mesh i ii iii the length of relaxation zone should be related to the wavelength according to the study of jacobsen et al 2012 and afshar 2010 jacobsen et al 2012 has suggested that the relaxation zone can work well with l rz l equal to or larger than 1 where l rz denotes the length of relaxation zone in this study the maximum wave length is l 2 85 m and hence 3m length of the relaxation zone was adopted to make sure l rz l 1 the validity of the relaxation zone for nonlinear waves was examined the wave parameters h 0 089 m and 0 156 m t 1 71 s and l 2 85 m were selected the maximum and minimum wave lengths are 2 85 m and 1 49 m respectively time series of free surface elevation in the relaxation zone x 10 0 10 5 11 0 11 5 and 12 0 m were presented in fig 5 it was found that the waves can be totally absorbed by the relaxation zone for wave interacting with comb type structures the wave steepness of reflected transmitted wave was smaller than that in the validation case of fig 5 thus the relaxation zone with 3 m long was adequate for absorbing waves in this study fig 6 a shows the time series of wave elevations at x 7 m with the three different meshes vertical distribution numerical results of the mean horizontal velocity and pressure at t 14 4 s are shown in fig 6 b and c respectively the position x 7 m was selected because the caisson type structure was placed at x 7 m in the following study we also note that the wave crest reached x 7 m at t 14 4 s fig 6 a shows that the wave elevation time series obtained with mesh ii and mesh iii were in good agreement the coarse mesh i seemed to slightly overpredict the wave crests however for the wave pressure and horizontal velocity vertical distributions fig 6 b and c both suggest notable differences in the mesh i result from those obtained for mesh ii and mesh iii the errors could be attributed to the numerical dissipations from the coarse mesh the comparisons in fig 6 suggested that the present mesh ii and mesh iii densities produced convincing predictions not only for the wave elevation but also the near bed velocity and pressure distributions the simulations were run with a workstation equipped with two intel xeon gold 6230r cpus with 52 physical cores and 128 gb ram two cpus can reach up to 3 8 tflops if the simulation was discretized using mesh iii partition method the total cell number will exceed 10 million which proved to be computationally expensive thus the mesh ii partition method was adopted to further consider the computational efficiency in this case in the refinement region around free surface the cell size in x direction δx was related to the wave length l the cell size in y direction δy was set a value δy h min 9 and the h min was the minimum value of wave height to be simulated the cell size in z direction δz was equal to δy this mesh treatment method can ensure the accuracy of the numerical model where more refined mesh grid can be obtained for the larger wave steepness further refinement in the vicinity of the introduced structure will be examined case by case 3 2 numerical validations we validated the numerical model coupled with the modified turbulence model against analytical and experimental results the 3d numerical wave flume constructed in section 3 1 in the absence of structures was employed to simulate a simple progressive wave train the numerical free surface elevation time series was then validated against analytical and experimental results the model validation was also extended for wave interactions with common coastal structures vertical walls and sloping breakwater finally the full 3d wave interaction with a comb type caisson breakwater was simulated for comparisons with laboratory measurements 3 2 1 long duration wave propagation in the absence of structure the tested case was the same as that considered in section 3 1 the computational conditions included wave height h 0 089 m and wave period t 1 71 s with a constant water depth d 0 333 m the mesh ii partition was adopted fig 7 shows the comparison between analytical and numerical results for the free surface elevation time series the wave height and wave phase were similar to those of the long term wave propagation analytical solution this meant that the present numerical wave flume could accurately predict wave propagation over long durations in fig 8 we compared the free surface elevation time series between the numerical and experimental results liu et al 2018 liu et al 2018 conducted a series of physical model tests to investigate wave propagation for long durations in the absence of structures three wave conditions i e h 0 09 m and t 0 97 s h 0 09 m and t 1 29 s and h 0 12 m and t 1 29 s were adopted with a constant water depth d 0 45 m we observed good agreements at different wave conditions the above validations indicated that the relaxation zone method worked well and the present numerical wave flume can simulate the long term wave train propagation 3 2 2 waves interaction with vertical walls the numerical results for wave dynamic pressure p d acting on the vertical wall were compared with the experimental results from kirca and kabdasli 2009 fig 9 presents a numerical wave flume 2 d sketch for waves acting on the vertical wall the wave train was incident at h 0 10 m and t 0 80 s with a constant water depth d 0 54 m fig 10 shows the dynamic pressure time evolutions at different positions y 0 425 m and 0 50 m where y 0 54 m corresponds to the still water level swl the dynamic pressure was normalised by ρgh good agreements were obtained in terms of the amplitude and dynamic pressure phase 3 2 3 wave breaking on a slope we validated the numerical model with experimental data from spilling breaking waves on a slope ting and kirby 1994 1996 fig 11 presents a layout of the computational domain for simulating spilling breaking waves on a slope a detailed experimental setup is given in ting and kirby 1994 1996 and only important parameters are summarized here a flat region with constant depth d 0 4 m was connected to a region with a constant 1 35 slope the origin was located at a position where the still water depth was d 0 0 38 m see fig 11 the wave height h 0 125 m and wave period t 2 s were adopted from the physical model test observations wave breaking began at x b 6 4 m with d b 0 196 m the velocities and free surface elevations were measured at eight vertical cross sections around the breaking point the data measured at five positions were used for comparisons with numerical results corresponding to one pre breaking position x x x b d b and x 2 286 as well as four positions in the surf zone x 4 397 7 462 13 618 and 16 709 before extracting data the numerical models were run for 60 periods warm up period to achieve a relatively convincing stable situation after reaching the numerical simulation quasi steady state the results presented in fig 12 14 were obtained by averaging an additional 60 periods referring to the mesh convergence test in section 3 1 the computational domain on the flat region was discretized into cells with δ x δ y δ z 0 01 m while the cell size on the slope region was δ x δ y δ z 0 005 m the following notations were adopted in this study η is the instantaneous water surface elevation and η 1 t 0 t η ⅆ t is the time average water surface elevation over one wave period where the overbar is a time average operator fig 12 compares numerical and experimental free surface elevations at x 4 397 7 462 and 13 618 the initial numerical simulation times at different locations matched the time t t 0 in the ting and kirby 1996 experimental results numerical free surface elevations also agreed with those from ting and kirby 1996 note that near the wave crest the increase in numerical free surface elevation was slightly more rapid than the increase in experimental surface elevation fig 13 shows comparisons between numerical and experimental time mean velocity profiles in the x direction u x at x 2 286 x 4 397 x 7 462 x 13 618 and x 16 709 the u x was normalised by the wave celerity c w we observed good agreements between the experimental data and the numerical results for the mean velocity component where the agreements at positions of x 2 286 x 7 462 x 13 618 and x 16 709 were better than those at x 4 397 fig 14 shows a comparison between the nondimensional numerical and experimental time mean turbulence kinetic energy tke k g d 0 5 profiles ting and kirby 1994 did not measure turbulence velocity in the z direction u z in their experiments thus in this study tke was estimated by k 0 75 u x 2 u y 2 scott et al 2005 also used this tke estimation method in the surf zone in addition the experimental time mean tke profile ting and kirby 1994 at pre breaking points x 2 286 was not given but the turbulence velocity component u x 2 profile was provided at x 2 286 k was approximated by k 1 25 u x 2 following the study of scott et al 2005 the agreements between the mean velocity component experimental data and the numerical results were reasonable at x 2 286 x 7 462 x 13 618 and x 16 709 in this section a numerical wave flume coupled with the standard k ω turbulence model abbreviated to nwtkω was also established to simulate spilling breaking waves on a slope where the standard k ω turbulence model was developed by wilcox 1988 comparisons between the tke near the breaking point estimated by the nwtkω and that estimated by the present numerical model with modified k ω turbulence model were plotted in fig 14 it can be seen from fig 14 a tke overestimation occurred near the breaking point x 4 397 however compared with the tke estimated by nwtkw blue dashed dot line in fig 14 a tke overprediction from the present numerical solution red dashed line in fig 14 a was greatly suppressed from the preceding analysis numerical simulations generally captured the major wave characteristics u x and η and turbulence characteristics k under breaking waves 3 2 4 wave interaction with comb type caisson breakwater experimental results from li et al 2002 were used to validate numerical wave flumes for waves interacting with comb type caisson breakwaters li et al 2002 conducted physical model tests to investigate the wave action on comb type caisson breakwater in a wave flume 60 m in length 2 m in width and 1 8 m in depth five comb type caissons made by polymethyl methacrylate were placed in the wave flume shown in fig 15 the water depth d under laboratory conditions was 0 333 m the rectangular caisson model length was fixed at 0 222 m and the distance d s 0 133 m between the side plate and the tank bottom was used three wave gauges wg1 wg2 and wg3 were set to measure the time series of free surface elevation as shown in fig 15 the w1 and wg2 wave gauges were placed at least one wavelength way from the caisson the third wave gauge wg3 was set behind the caisson to measure free surface elevations of transmitted waves the regular wave parameters and dimensions of comb type caisson are illustrated in table 2 and fig 16 based on experimental data li et al 2002 developed the following empirical formula for the wave reflection coefficient c r 11 c r 32 424 b 1 l 2 11 317 b 1 l 1 3686 eq 11 shows that a comb type caisson breakwater wave reflection coefficient is mainly affected by the relative wave chamber width b 1 l with l being the wave length in fig 17 a 3d numerical wave flume is set up to reproduce the experiments the total length of the wave flume was 13 m with a height of 0 70 m the wave flume widths were equal to the caisson structure lengths l w three caisson structure widths l w 0 312 m 0 354 m and 0 40 m were considered for a clear view of the internal wave flume details the right side face relaxation zones and internal meshes were not plotted the still water level was at y 0 333 m a comb type caisson one unit length between cross sections aa and cc of fig 17 was placed between x 7 00 m and x 7 44 m in the 3d numerical wave flume the relaxation zone with 3 m long was adopted for absorbing waves in this study generally fine meshes were distributed in the vicinity of structures and free surface to save computational effort the whole computational mesh including the geometry of comb type caisson δx δy δz 0 02 m was firstly created using the blockmesh tool where 131 vertices and 50 blocks were defined in the dictionary of blockmesh then by using the mesh ii treatment method mesh refinement was conducted along x y and z directions around the free surface elevation see fig 18 further mesh refinement was carried out in the red dotted box computational domain 6 50 m x 8 00 m 0 00 m y 0 600 m and the entire z in the mesh refinement region near the structures the original cell was split into eight elements per cell where the aspect ratio equalled to 1 the total number of cells in fig 18 was 1663982 this was because in that region violent wave deformation and wave breaking take place in this region fig 19 presents comparisons between the experimental and numerical reflection coefficient c r the reflection coefficient was calculated using the method proposed by goda and suzuki 1976 the adopted wave parameters and caisson dimensions were identical to those of the physical model test in table 2 the calculation conditions were as follows three lengths of side plate a 0 044 m 0 067 m and 0 089 m and three front wave chamber widths b 1 0 2 m 0 267 m and 0 333 m with a fixed total wave chamber width b 0 444 m experimental and numerical results for different cases generally agreed well however in fig 19 b near the relative wave chamber width b 1 l 0 218 the c r numerical result was close to the empirical formula curve in li et al 2002 which was quite different from the experimental data fig 19 shows that c r first decreased to a minimum value and then increased with b 1 l the above comparisons suggested that the present numerical model could be used to simulate wave interactions with comb type caisson breakwaters the relative error analysis of reflection coefficient c r between numerical and experimental results were conducted in table 3 it was found that the relative error is relatively small generally but when b 1 l 0 223 the numerical and experimental c r were not vertically aligned where the numerical c r was relatively close to the curves of empirical formula of li et al 2002 and far less than the experimental results in fig 19 b the abnormal value of experimental results in fig 19 b was quite different from those in fig 19 a and fig 19 c at the same value of b 1 l it is assumed that experimental c r at b 1 l 0 223 may be inaccuracy where the value of experimental c r deviates far from curves of empirical formula 4 numerical results and discussions 4 1 wave transmission energy dissipation and reflection coefficients based on potential flow theory previous analytical studies by wang et al 2019 reported that the reflection and transmission coefficient c t was highly dependent on the wave chamber width b 1 l and presented a periodic variation with b 1 l the energy dissipation due to fluid viscosity could not be directly considered as well thus we adopted the present viscous numerical model to quantify the wave transmission and the physical energy dissipation we then used it to consider the effects of wave height on the reflection coefficient with the preceding verified three dimensional viscous numerical model we studied the effects of the relative wave chamber width b 1 l on the wave transmission coefficient c t the wave conditions and numerical setup were the same as those in fig 19 the numerical results in fig 20 a present a small oscillatory variation with b 1 l the transmission coefficient variations with b 1 l decreased significantly compared with the potential predictions by the wang et al 2019 solution this could be attributed to the correct physical dissipation in the present viscous model in addition fig 20 a shows that the difference between the two c t versus b 1 l fitting curves for the two cases with α 0 089 and 0 044 m was no more than 0 15 this suggested that the side plate length had a limited influence on wave transmission the dissipation coefficient c e is defined as follows 12 c e 1 c r 2 c t 2 the influence of the wave chamber width b 1 l on energy dissipation is examined in fig 20 all the energy dissipation coefficients c e with different side plate lengths increased first with b 1 l the largest energy dissipation coefficient was found for the case with a 0 089 m and b 1 l 0 17 where nearly 80 of the incident wave energy was dissipated as the energy dissipation coefficient reached the maximum it decreased slightly with increasing wave chamber width for different side plate lengths the energy dissipation was high when the relative wave chamber width was 0 15 b 1 l 0 25 we also found that the side plate length a influence on the dissipation coefficient was manifested for the moderate wave chamber width b 1 l where the larger side plate length a generally led to higher energy dissipation variations in the transmission coefficient c t versus dimensionless wave height are presented in fig 21 four wave heights h 0 089 m 0 111 m 0 133 m and 0 156 m were adopted where k 0 is the wave number and the wave amplitude a h h 2 we considered four wave periods t 1 04 s fig 21 a b and c 1 27 s fig 21 d e and f 1 49 s fig 21 g h and i and 1 71 s fig 21 j k and l the structural parameters are labelled in the figures the reflection coefficient c r slightly increased when the wave height increased for wave periods t 1 04 s 1 27 s and 1 49 s the decreasing transmission coefficient was more apparent with the increase in wave height compared with the case of wave period t 1 71 s it is noteworthy that the reflection coefficient for a 0 044 m was relatively small compared with c t for a 0 067 m and a 0 089 m 4 2 flow fields near structure a numerical model was employed to further explore flow field characteristics under breaking waves which are difficult to investigate in laboratory experiments a vertical cross section of the computational domain created along cross section bb in the numerical wave flume see fig 22 was obtained to better visualise the velocity and dynamic pressure field spatial distributions and turbulence kinetic energy field as shown in figs 23 25 a typical wave condition of h 0 089 m and t 1 71 s with a constant water depth d 0 333 m was adopted we considered comb type caissons dimensions a 0 067 m b 1 0 267 m b 0 44 m c 0 111 m and d s 0 133 m 4 2 1 velocity and dynamic pressure field spatial distributions the snapshots in the left column of fig 23 a 23 e show the velocity u u x u y u z and dynamic pressure p d fields around the structure within a wave period from t 8 42t to t 9 42t at t 8 42t the incoming wave crest reached the caisson front wall in the right column of each snapshot the 3d free surfaces with streamlines at corresponding times were plotted to better understand the flow field characteristics the free surface is coloured according to the mean velocity magnitude which is defined as u u x 2 u y 2 u z 2 note that u i u i i x y z is the time mean velocity where the overbar was neglected for simplicity in the following section fig 23 a shows that when the wave crest reached the caisson front wall the wave front had deformed and its shape lost its original aspect then the waves impacted the caisson and side plate forming wave run up in addition clockwise vortices were formed in front of the side plate because of wave run up and local backflow generated by waves interacting with the side plate in fig 23 b as the wave continued to propagate a portion of the wave energy impacted the crown wall while beneath the side plate the wave propagated and enters the bay side at the tip of the side plate the velocity was relatively large due to the fluid domain contraction anti clockwise vortices were formed with the energy transfer from the wave to vortices in fig 23 b to fig 23 c the wave started to fall back and caused the local backflow to splash into the front wave chamber the strong local backflow acting on the free surface interface led to a portion of the mixture between air and water phases and a significant amount of air was entrained wave breaking in this region was violent the main vortex tended to disappear and many small vortices were observed in the rear wave chamber in the process from fig 23 c 23 e the wave started to propagate into the front wave chamber again as the wave approached the caisson structure the wave front became almost vertical and a jet of water was projected forwards in the meantime a tube of air was enveloped generating large scale aerated water the wave continued to propagate into the wave chamber and impacted the side plate forming wave run up similar to fig 23 a from the right column of fig 23 a 23 e vortices were formed grown and dissipated as suggested by the streamlines in this way the wave energy was dissipated through wave deformation wave breaking and vortex shedding notably the velocity field values were large just behind the exit of the rear wave chamber x 7 5 m and 7 7 m the relatively large local velocity should arouse attention because it may damage the foundation bed the dynamic pressure p d field is presented in the left column of fig 23 the dynamic pressure p d was normalised by ρgh fig 23 a shows that positive dynamic pressure appeared in the wave crest region and negative dynamic pressure appeared in the wave trough region at the time instants of fig 23 b e positive dynamic pressure near the superstructure and upper part of the side plate was larger than in the other regions this was because at those instants local flow with large velocity was generated by waves interacting with the structure the large dynamic pressure values were distributed near the side plate and superstructure which were weak components in the comb type caisson this should be taken into consideration in side plate and superstructure reinforcement designs another important feature can be observed from fig 23 a d and e with clockwise vortices and fig 23 b and c with anti clockwise vortices vortex generation would cause a severe reduction in dynamic pressure and even lead to negative dynamic pressure 4 2 2 turbulence kinetic energy field spatial distribution regarding turbulence effects in wave interactions with comb type caisson breakwaters snapshots are presented in fig 24 to illustrate nondimensional tke k g d 0 5 fields around the structure fig 24 a shows large tke levels in the wave crest and vortex region in fig 24 b high tke levels were observed at the side plate tip caused by anti clockwise vortices in fig 24 c and d at these instants a region of large tke levels were found inside the wave chamber where wave breaking was violent generally in fig 24 a e high tke levels were first generated in the vicinity of caisson structure due to strong wave breaking and wave impact and then the high tke levels were transported and diffused because of vortex shedding higuera et al 2014 also found that high turbulence levels were distributed around coastal structures and turbulence distribution around free surface and structure was diffused they assumed that high tke levels were transported from the high turbulence region to the low turbulence region due to convection and diffusion another important feature was that significantly high tke levels could be found in the region within half wavelength away from the caisson in other regions the tke values were rather small which suggested that mean flows could be well approximated by nearly potential flow approximation this nearly potential flow approximation was implemented by activating the second max function argument eq a4 in the modified k ω turbulence model the breaking processing had little influence on the nearly potential flow region this also confirmed that wave breaking was a local process with its effects mainly confined around the caisson lin and liu 1998b 4 2 3 wavelet analysis of breaking and non breaking waves wavelet analysis can be used to identify the wave energy distribution at different frequencies a detailed review of wavelet analysis in the context of fluid mechanics can be found in farge 1992 here the commonly used morlet wavelet was adopted to analyse waveform signals fig 25 shows the wavelet transform of the free surface elevation time series at x 7 m breaking wave and x 10 m nonbreaking wave along centreline bb see fig 22 two wave periods t 1 04 s and 1 71 s were considered the real wave frequency f after the wavelet transform was normalised by the incident wave frequency f i the model simulation time t was normalised by the wave period t the contour map was coloured by the wavelet coefficient modulus large values of the wavelet coefficient modulus mean high wave energy while zero coefficient modulus means no wave energy at the corresponding frequency thus on the basis of these considerations fig 25 a and c showed that the breaking wave energy was mainly contained around the incident wave frequency and that a small portion of wave energy was distributed around multiple incident wave frequencies i e f f i 2 3 and 4 comparing fig 25 b with fig 25 d the transmission wave energy of long period wave t 1 71 s was larger than that of t 1 04 s as the wave period increased more of the wave energy went to higher frequencies 4 3 wave forces on comb type caisson the wave force on a comb type caisson was evaluated by integrating pressure p and viscous stress tensor τ i j 2 μ μ t s i j over the surface of the structure 13 f j ω j p j τ i j ⅆ γ j where γ j is the surface area of the structure the normal directions of structure surface are plotted in fig 26 where the normal direction of surfaces along x axis are coloured with red and the normal direction of surfaces along z axis are coloured with blue the normal direction of rest structure surfaces along y axis coloured with grey in fig 27 the time evolution of the wave force acting on the comb type caisson in the x direction f x is presented four wave heights h 0 089 m 0 111 m 0 133 m and 0 156 m and two wave periods t 1 71 s and 1 49 s were considered the caisson width was l 0 356 m other comb type caisson dimensions were a 0 067 m b 1 0 267 m b 0 45 m c 0 11 m and d s 0 13 m to compare different wave heights f x was normalised by f 0 where f 0 ρ g h 0 l d and h 0 0 122 m were the average of the four wave heights dimensionless wave force f x f 0 amplitudes acting on the comb type caisson increased when wave height increased for t 1 49 s and t 1 71 s from additional numerical simulations we found that overtopping discharge increased with increasing wave height more overtopping discharge resulted in more wave energy more water mass directly acting on the front face of the comb type caisson this behaviour likely indicated a larger f x f 0 amplitude park et al 2017 also observed this phenomenon when they investigated the horizontal and vertical wave forces on an elevated coastal structure comparing fig 27 a with fig 27 b the dimensionless wave force f x f 0 amplitudes for t 1 49 s were smaller than those of t 1 71 s the f x f 0 time evolution for different wave heights had a slight phase difference this slight discrepancy might have been mainly induced by wave breaking and wave overtopping discharge at different wave heights two side plates are the weak components of comb type caissons under wave actions the wave force in the x direction f xc acting on the rectangular caisson and wave force f xsp in the x direction acting on two side plates fig 28 a were presented at different side plate lengths i e a 0 044 m 0 067 m and 0 089 m f xc and f xsp were normalised by f 0 the dimensionless f xc and f x s p amplitudes changed slightly with the side plate length fig 28 a shows that the maximum f x c and maximum f x s p did not reach the peaks simultaneously which had a time difference δt this was the main reason that the comb type caisson breakwater could effectively reduce the wave force compared with vertical wall breakwater the comparison in terms of time phase between total wave force in the x direction f x the y direction f y and the z direction f z were presented in fig 28 b the time phase different δt between f x f y and f z was approximately equal to 0 but the value of total force f y and f z approached to 0 which meant the stability of structure was good under normally incident wave condition 5 conclusion in this study a 3d numerical model based on openfoam was developed to simulate waves interacting with open comb type caisson breakwaters the numerical flume using the modified k ω turbulence model enabled nearly constant wave propagation over a long duration the periodic boundary condition was implemented to significantly save computational effort the numerical model was validated by comparing several numerical solutions with analytical solutions and experimental data and we confirmed that the numerical results were in good agreement with the analytical and experimental results numerical simulations were conducted to understand flow characteristics near caisson structures the effects of wave and structural parameters on wave reflection wave transmission wave energy dissipation and wave force were examined the main conclusions are given as follows hydrodynamic performance of open comb type caisson characterized based on the reflection coefficient and energy dissipation coefficient was highly dependent on the relative wave chamber width b 1 l however the transmission coefficient presented a small oscillatory variation with b 1 l we found that energy dissipation reached up to 80 of the total wave energy with side plate lengths a 0 089 m and b 1 l 0 17 and energy dissipation was high when the relative wave chamber width 0 15 b 1 l 0 25 the side plate length had a limited influence on the wave transmission with increasing wave height the reflection coefficient decreased the dimensionless horizontal wave force amplitude on the two side plates changed slightly with the side plate length the maximum wave forces acting on the caisson and side plates in the x direction did not occur simultaneously due to the wave phase difference between the side plate and front wall of a rectangular caisson the phase shift of wave forces between rectangular caisson and the side plates is the main reason of the advantage in mechanical characteristics of comb type structure for different period incident waves the dimensionless wave force amplitude acting on the caisson in the x direction increased when the wave height increased in the region within half a wave length away from the caisson structure high tke levels were observed due to wave breaking and vortex shedding the wave breaking inside the wave chamber and vortices around the caisson structure were the primary ways to dissipate wave energy vortex generation caused a severe reduction in dynamic pressure the large dynamic pressure levels were distributed near the side plate and superstructure which were the weak components in the comb type caisson this study provides a better understanding of comb type caisson breakwater hydrodynamic performance the numerical model can also be applied for other periodic arrays of equally spaced identical caissons credit authorship contribution statement xin yu wang

202113032 appendix brief introduction of modified turbulence model in the numerical simulations of waves interacting with coastal structures using the rans model coupled with various two equation turbulence closure models there has been a tendency to overpredict turbulence levels in regions of nearly potential flow prior wave breaking and post breaking mayer and madsen 2000 overpredicted turbulence can cause significant wave height decay this implied that cfd models coupled with commonly used two equation turbulence closure models e g standard k ω sst shear stress transport k ω nonlinear k ϵ and rng renormalized group k ϵ models could not accurately simulate long term wave propagation brown et al 2016 devolder et al 2017 by comparing numerical results with the experimental data from ting and kirby 1994 lin and liu 1998a also found that turbulence levels were overpredicted which led to wave height decay when they investigated breaking waves in the surf zone of a slope to eliminate this phenomenon mayer and madsen 2000 made an ad hoc modification to the production term of the standard k ω turbulence model wilcox 1988 by substituting the mean rotation rate into the mean strain rate however they found that the modified model could not be considered a fundamentally available solution owing to nonconformity with boussinesq s eddy viscosity approximation wilcox 2006 added a limiting function for ω into the standard k ω closure model which limits the resulting eddy viscosity in regions where turbulence production exceeded the dissipation however the problem of turbulence tke unphysical exponential growth and eddy viscosity was not solved to solve this long standing problem larsen and fuhrman 2018 introduced a limiting function with respect to ω into a commonly used two equation turbulence model the limiting function was related to the mean rotation and strain rates of the fluid which are discussed later through a comparison between numerical and experimental results they found that the numerical model coupled with the modified turbulence closure model could avoid unphysical exponential growth thus the wave height decay phenomenon was suppressed larsen 2018 have released the codes of the formally stabilized turbulence model for openfoam 5 0 foamextened 3 1 and openfoam v1712 in the github repository where four two equation turbulence models were included for openfoam v1712 namely the formally stabilized versions of k ω sst k ω standard k ε and rng k ε turbulence models following larsen and fuhrman 2018 a brief introduction to the modification of the standard k ω turbulence model is given as follows in the study of larsen and fuhrman 2018 the generalized k ω turbulence model including the advection equations of the turbulent kinetic energy density k 1 2 u i u i and the specific dissipation ratio ω reads a1 ρ k t u j ρ k x j ρ p k ρ p b ρ c μ k ω x j μ ρ σ k k ω k x j a2 ρ ω t u j ρ ω x j ρ p ω ρ β ω 2 ρ σ d ω k x j ω x j x j μ ρ σ ω k ω ω x j where u j and u i are the mean and fluctuation components of velocity respectively x j are the cartesian coordinates μ ρν is the dynamic molecular viscosity ν is the kinematic viscosity ρ is the density t is the time and a3 τ i j u i u j 2 ν t s i j 2 3 ρ δ i j is the reynolds stress tensor δ ij is the kronecker delta a4 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i is the mean strain rate tensor and the eddy viscosity ν t is defined as a5 ν t k ω the shear production term for k is p k χ 0 ν t with χ 0 2 s i j s i j similarly the buoyancy production for k is formulated as p b p b ν t and p b α b g i ρ ρ x i where g 1 g 2 g 3 0 0 g is gravitational acceleration the production of ω is taken as a6 p ω γ ω k ω ω p k γ ω ω χ 0 two utility variables ω and ω are introduced rather than the usual one variable ω the model coefficient values are set to β 0 0708 γ 0 52 c u 0 09 σ k 0 6 σ ω 0 5 α b 1 36 and σ d 0 125 h k x j ω x j where h is the heaviside step function which takes a value of unity if the argument is positive and zero otherwise to solve the overestimation of k and ν t for the original k ω turbulence model a limiter function involving two variables ω and ω for the specific dissipation rate ω was proposed by larsen and fuhrman 2018 as follows a7 ω max ω λ 1 p 0 p b c μ a8 ω max ω λ 2 β c μ γ χ 0 χ ω ω where χ ω 2 ω i j ω i j and ω i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i is the mean rotation rate tensor λ 2 1 is an additional stress limiter coefficient note that if λ 1 λ 2 0 the generalized expression form of the modified k ω turbulence model becomes equivalent to the standard k ω turbulence model of wilcox 1988 whereas the turbulence model becomes equivalent to the wilcox 2006 model with λ 2 0 hence it is easy to implement a generalized version of k ω turbulence model to consider additional freedom by introducing a limiter function following larsen and fuhrman 2018 λ 1 0 and λ 2 0 05 are adopted in this study moreover in a region of nearly potential flow the second argument in the max function eq a8 becomes active because χ ω χ 0 in complex sheared flow regions the first argument in the max function eq a8 is active where χ ω and χ 0 are in the same order of magnitude 
20454,in this study we investigate the vibration active control of two boundaries on a floating beam structure fbs with an unknown system damping considering the floating hydroelasticity a novel adaptive control scheme of two boundaries on fbs with state observer is first proposed to act on the upstream and downstream ends of fbs respectively where state observer is designed to track unknown system damping due to the structural and hydrodynamic disturbance the numerical studies have been given to analyze the hydroelastic response of floating beam structure under the proposed controller the obtained numerical results illustrate that with the consideration of unknown damping in the design the proposed control strategy could more effectively reduce the vibration of fbs under regular waves especially in the area close to boundaries keywords floating beam structure boundary controller hydroelastic response unknown damping 1 introduction with the development demand of reliable offshore structures and marine equipment cao et al 2021 patel 1989 wang et al 2008 yang 2018 zhang et al 2014 2021 beam structures floating in waves have broadly been studied in both numerical simulation and actual experiment since floating beam structures are located in the complex ocean environments the external forces due to ocean wave can result in the mechanical vibration of structures the severe vibration would bring about the problems of comfort safety and even fatigue failure therefore the control methods could be designed to reduce the effect of hydrodynamic forces and suppress the hydroelastic response of beam structures the recent advances in digital signal processing sensors and actuators technologies have prompted interest in active vibration control on structure since beam structures are modelled by partial differential equations pde which possess an infinite number of dimensions it is hard to propose an effective control strategy to stabilize the system with a limited number of sensors and actuators in order to overcome this difficulty in the conventional approaches a modal approach is used to obtain a truncated model of the pde system where only the main modes of system are used for control design denoyer and kwak 1996 gaudenzi et al 1997 2000 in the literature various control methods have been developed based on this procedure kerboua et al 2015 applies smart materials to control and reduce the vibration of such beams based on passive piezoelectric vibration shunt control technique pi and ouyang 2015a utilize a method combining smc and ppf is proposed to suppress the vibration of the beam when the moving mass is on and off the beam all above methods could effectively reduce the vibration of structure however since the residual modes are not actually truncated in the real systems it affects the state observation and also produces observation spill over and control spill over phenomena these phenomena would become more significant with the increase of the size of structure it could cause the invalidity of the proposed control methods and even deteriorate the performance of system balas mj 1978 to solve the above problems there are significant efforts for the control design to suppress the vibration of the distributed parameters systems where the control design is based on the original pde beam do 2017 hong and shah 2018 jin and guo 2015 nguyen et al 2013 pi and ouyang 2015b yang 2017 yang and gao 2016 zhao et al 2019 2020 for example in do and pan 2009 a marine riser is simulated as an euler bernoulli beam and boundary control at the top of the riser is applied to reduce the vibrations of the riser in he et al 2013 adaptive boundary controller is proposed and applied at the top and bottom boundaries of the riser to position the subsea payload to the desired set point and reduce the vibration in he et al he and ge 2014 a framework of dynamical analysis and control design is developed for various marine mechanical systems such as installation system flexible riser system and mooring system recently zhao et al zhao et al 2019 2020 respectively study the anti saturation control and dead zone compensation in the boundary control design for flexible riser systems to sum up the above contributions mainly study the boundary control with one boundary fixed furthermore the dynamic properties of floating beam structures with ocean effect are different from these existing studies since the restoring term due to gravity effect is included into the structural dynamics of fbs to explore the boundary control on fbs several studies have been done by yang and guo 2016 and yang 2017 with the certain system parameters in yang and gao 2016 the boundary control is first proposed for fbs under regular wave in yang 2017 a hybrid active and passive controller is designed to improve the system dynamics in fbs however system damping in the laminate floating beam structure is relatively hard to be evaluated especially in the effect of uncertain ocean hydromechanics since system damping may has significant effect to the beam structures riyansyah 2009 it is more meaningful to study fbs with unknown system damping to the best of our knowledge there is no research to study this problem for fbs in the literatures the main purpose of this paper is to design a novel boundary controller on two boundaries to suppress the vibration on fbs subject to the description of the specialized governing equations marine structures usually are a laminate structure patel 1989 in the literature the equivalent single layer structure could be effectively used to describe the dynamics of structure with purpose of structural analysis nettles 1994 this strategy is also used in this study the dynamic model of floating beam structure is simulated as a distributed parameter system with euler bernoulli beam structure in the fluid dynamics the incident and reflection effect of regular wave is described as a periodic force the system damping generally includes structural damping and hydrodynamic damping the hydrodynamic damping is affected by ocean environment nikolai 2011 in this study predefined properties and assumptions are given for the derived dynamic model by building proper functional the proposed boundary controllers can be designed and applied on the upstream and downstream boundaries through actuators at the mooring system shown in fig 1 where state observer is used to track the unknown system damping the numerical experiments are carried out to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed controller with various system parameters 2 problem statement in this study fbs found in fig 2 is numerically simulated as a uniform euler bernoulli beam structure the vertical displacement w x t is used to describe the motion of fbs in the regular waves the boundary controllers u l t and v 0 t are respectively acted on the upstream and downstream boundaries for the stabilization of fbs e k t is

as 4 δ w f 0 l f x t δ w x t d x where f x t is the force loaded on fbs due to the incident wave and reflected wave it is assumed that f x t f with a constant f the virtual work from uncertain damping on fbs is given as 5 δ w d 0 l c d w t x t δ w x t d x c d δ w l t c d δ w 0 t where c d is the unknown system damping coefficient of the floating beam structure which mainly includes structure

coefficient of the hydrostatic restoring force the virtual work from boundary controller is described as 6 δ w m u l t δ w l t v 0 t δ w 0 t where u l t is control force at the boundary l of fbs v 0 t is control force at the boundary 0 of fbs thus we have the total virtual work done on the floating beam structure as 7 δ w δ w f δ w m δ w d δ w r after the variation operator and integrating

stability theorem of fbs the following lemmas and assumptions are presented lemma 1 hardy et al 1959 let w x t r be a function defined with x 0 l and t 0 that satisfies the boundary condition w 0 t 0 then the following inequalities hold 12 w 2 x t l 0 l w x 2 x t d x assumption 1 the damping coefficient c d can be lower and upper bounded with c l c d c m where c l and c m are two positive constants 3 control design in this study the objective of control aims to reduce the vibration of fbs with unknown damping and time varying distributed load originated from ocean disturbances in the active controller design the fbs will be stabilized in some neighborhood of its original state with the following theorem theorem 1 for the fbs described by 1 and boundary constraints 2 3 and 4 with the control gains k and k 1 and the positive constants β r g and α we have the active controllers 13 and 14 13 u l t k β α l 0 t w x l t d t β w l t γ 0 t w l t d t c ˆ d l t α l β w x l t γ c ˆ d l t

temporal or spatial integral he et al 2011 w 0 t w l t w x 0 t w x l t w x x x 0 t and w x x x l t could be measured by sensors the other items could be calculated by temporal or spatial integral according to sensor measurement remark 2 equations 17 20 will be applied in the building of layapunov functional for the stabilization of fbs in the appendix 4 simulation results 4 1 verification of the proposed boundary control to illustrate the performance of the controller designed in section 3 finite element method fem is used to simulate the dynamics of fbs where hermitian shape functions and galerkin s method is applied to yield the following fem governing matrix equation suzuki et al 1996 as stated in yang and gao 2016 the generalized wave force f x t acting on the floating beam structure can be written as 21 f x t f a m p sin k x x w f t where f a m p is the amplitude of wave force on the floating beam structure k x is the wave number of ocean wave on the floating beam structure and w f is the angular velocity of ocean wave on the floating beam structure the equivalent principle properties of the floating beam structure are given in table 1 k x is set to 0 1 and w is set to 0 5 rad s the system is uniformly divided into 150 elements and time intervals 0 001 s the time period is set to 100 s the appropriate dynamic performance of fbs could be obtained by the given control parameter values following as k k 1 2 4 10 7 r 1 g 1 β 9 1 10 7 α 310 the comparison of fbs vertical displacement with between no control and the proposed control are illustrated in fig 3 we can find that along the appropriate choice of control parameters the proposed boundary controllers 13 and 14 are able to significantly stabilize the vertical dynamics of fbs in a small neighborhood around zero the non dimensional boundary forces c f l 2 e i c f t are acted on the floating beam structure are shown in fig 4 in the structural design of marine structures the serviceability is of vital importance for marine structures to be an effective platform for land utility in order to quantitatively study this performance of fbs both the peak values and the root mean square rms values of displacement on fbs are considered and defined as following for application 22 m d x max w x t t 0 t 23 j d x 1 t 0 t w 2 x t d t where m d is the displacement peak value at the position x and j d is the displacement rms values at the position x six measurement positions with coordinates 0 m 1000 m 2000 m 3000 m 4000 m and 5000 m are utilized in this study for performance evaluation of fbs the maximum and rms displacement resulted by between no control and the proposed control are described in table 2 we can see the significant improvement of dynamic performance on fbs under the proposed boundary control in contrast there is a reduction of more than 40 on the maximum values of displacement and reduction of more than 35 on the rms values of displacement displacement response of the fbs at different positions is illustrated in fig 5 furthermore we compare the simulation results of the proposed method with the one estimated by yang and guo 2016 in this study we set that actual system damping is 5000 n s m 3 and the design system damping is 1000 n s m 3 the simulation results for these two methods are illustrated in fig 6 it can be found that the proposed method has a better performance on the area close to the boundary one can see that the vibration reduce by more than 15 it would probably because that more appropriate control force has been acted to stabilize the vibration of the boundaries the vibration reduction would significantly improve the comfortability when people work on the area close to boundary area the effect of boundary control will be decreased along the direction of the centre of fbs due to energy absorption by beam structure there is slightly slight improvement in the central area of fbs to further validate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm with the unknown system damping case studies are carried out for various system damping with the range from 100 to 1500 n s m 3 fig 7 a b illustrates the effect of the unknown system damping to the hydroelastic response the variation of rms displacement without control is shown in fig 7 a it could be found that the system damping has a uniform impact on the floating beam structure the hydroelastic response is reduced with increase in damping but the rate of reduction in the rms displacement tends to go down it indicates a drop in the impact of system damping to the hydroelastic response of floating beam structure fig 7 b illustrates the variation of rms displacement with the proposed boundary control one can see that the hydroelastic response on the whole floating beam system decreases with increase in system damping the rate of reduction has a same tendency with the system without control fig 8 illustrates the non dimensional rms control force c f r m s l 2 e i 1 t 0 t c f 2 t d t with various system damping it could be found that the increase of system damping is beneficial to decrease the control force so that the performance of actuator could be improved nevertheless the rate of improvement is going down with increase in system damping 4 2 the effect of ocean wave after the validation to the proposed control methods parametric studies are conducted to demonstrate the effects of ocean wave and bending stiffness on hydroelastic performance of the floating beam system with the same parameter definition in table 1 in order to investigate the effect of ocean wave on hydroelastic response with boundary control hydroelastic analyses are carried out for various wave amplitudes in the range from 5000 to 15000 n and various wave frequencies in the range from 0 4 to 1 0 respectively fig 9 illustrates total rms displacement t d i s p r m s 1 t l 0 l 0 t w 2 x t d t d x of floating beam structure for various wave amplitudes one can see that t d i s p r m s is going up with increase of wave amplitude nevertheless t d i s p r m s has a more significant increase when the floating beam structure freely vibrates without control fig 10 illustrates the non dimensional rms control force c f r m s with various wave amplitudes one can see that c f r m s is notably going up with the increase of wave amplitude thus in order to ensure the effectiveness of the proposed control method we have to choose the actuators with appropriate capacity depending on environmental assessment on the construction field fig 11 illustrates total rms displacement t d i s p r m s of fbs for various wave frequencies it is noted that t d i s p r m s on fbs with free vibration is obviously going up with increase of wave frequency the rate of increase is significantly arising with increase of wave frequency it also could be found that the wave frequency has a little effect to hydroelastic response when the floating beam structure vibrates under a proposed control in addition the control force shown in fig 12 has a little increase with wave frequency therefore we could conclude that the proposed control could effectively reduce the hydroelastic response from the effect of wave frequency 4 3 the effect of elastic rigidity fig 13 illustrates total rms displacement of fbs for various elastic rigidities one can see that compared with the hydroelastic response on free vibration hydroelastic response on the controlled fbs could be reduced to a comfort level for land utility purpose both t d i s p r m s with control and without control are going down with increase of wave elastic rigidity however the rate of improvement is gradually declining with increase of elastic rigidity furthermore the rms displacements along the fbs with various elastic rigidities are shown in fig 14 a and b it could be found from fig 14 a that the bending rigidities in the range from 0 5 1013 to 1 3 1013 nm have a great influence on hydroelastic response on the front portion of the floating beam system but has less effect to the middle and rear portion of the floating beam system it is same as the results with experiments by riyansyah 2009 it could be because that more energy is absorbed by the front portion of the floating beam system with higher bending stiffness fig 14 b illustrates the variation of rms displacement with the proposed boundary control one can see that the hydroelastic response decreases on the whole floating beam system as the rigid stiffness ei increases which is consistent with the illustration from equation a29 it is probably because the boundary controller could further prevent the propagation of the ocean wave energy from the front portion of the floating beam under the boundary control there is a more than 60 reduction of the rms displacement on the whole floating beam system when the bending stiffness increases from 0 5 1013 nm to 1 3 1013 nm fig 15 demonstrates the variation of the total rms input force with elastic rigidity one can see that along the performance improvement of hydroelastic response on the system the input control forces have an insignificant increase with elastic rigidity the rate of increase is reduced with increase in elastic rigidity it is obviously illustrated that the boundary control with an appropriate choice of the bending stiffness could more effectively improve the comfort and safety of the floating beam system 5 conclusion in this study we investigate the fbs system with unknown damping under regular waves

20454,in this study we investigate the vibration active control of two boundaries on a floating beam structure fbs with an unknown system damping considering the floating hydroelasticity a novel adaptive control scheme of two boundaries on fbs with state observer is first proposed to act on the upstream and downstream ends of fbs respectively where state observer is designed to track unknown system damping due to the structural and hydrodynamic disturbance the numerical studies have been given to analyze the hydroelastic response of floating beam structure under the proposed controller the obtained numerical results illustrate that with the consideration of unknown damping in the design the proposed control strategy could more effectively reduce the vibration of fbs under regular waves especially in the area close to boundaries keywords floating beam structure boundary controller hydroelastic response unknown damping 1 introduction with the development demand of reliable offshore structures and marine equipment cao et al 2021 patel 1989 wang et al 2008 yang 2018 zhang et al 2014 2021 beam structures floating in waves have broadly been studied in both numerical simulation and actual experiment since floating beam structures are located in the complex ocean environments the external forces due to ocean wave can result in the mechanical vibration of structures the severe vibration would bring about the problems of comfort safety and even fatigue failure therefore the control methods could be designed to reduce the effect of hydrodynamic forces and suppress the hydroelastic response of beam structures the recent advances in digital signal processing sensors and actuators technologies have prompted interest in active vibration control on structure since beam structures are modelled by partial differential equations pde which possess an infinite number of dimensions it is hard to propose an effective control strategy to stabilize the system with a limited number of sensors and actuators in order to overcome this difficulty in the conventional approaches a modal approach is used to obtain a truncated model of the pde system where only the main modes of system are used for control design denoyer and kwak 1996 gaudenzi et al 1997 2000 in the literature various control methods have been developed based on this procedure kerboua et al 2015 applies smart materials to control and reduce the vibration of such beams based on passive piezoelectric vibration shunt control technique pi and ouyang 2015a utilize a method combining smc and ppf is proposed to suppress the vibration of the beam when the moving mass is on and off the beam all above methods could effectively reduce the vibration of structure however since the residual modes are not actually truncated in the real systems it affects the state observation and also produces observation spill over and control spill over phenomena these phenomena would become more significant with the increase of the size of structure it could cause the invalidity of the proposed control methods and even deteriorate the performance of system balas mj 1978 to solve the above problems there are significant efforts for the control design to suppress the vibration of the distributed parameters systems where the control design is based on the original pde beam do 2017 hong and shah 2018 jin and guo 2015 nguyen et al 2013 pi and ouyang 2015b yang 2017 yang and gao 2016 zhao et al 2019 2020 for example in do and pan 2009 a marine riser is simulated as an euler bernoulli beam and boundary control at the top of the riser is applied to reduce the vibrations of the riser in he et al 2013 adaptive boundary controller is proposed and applied at the top and bottom boundaries of the riser to position the subsea payload to the desired set point and reduce the vibration in he et al he and ge 2014 a framework of dynamical analysis and control design is developed for various marine mechanical systems such as installation system flexible riser system and mooring system recently zhao et al zhao et al 2019 2020 respectively study the anti saturation control and dead zone compensation in the boundary control design for flexible riser systems to sum up the above contributions mainly study the boundary control with one boundary fixed furthermore the dynamic properties of floating beam structures with ocean effect are different from these existing studies since the restoring term due to gravity effect is included into the structural dynamics of fbs to explore the boundary control on fbs several studies have been done by yang and guo 2016 and yang 2017 with the certain system parameters in yang and gao 2016 the boundary control is first proposed for fbs under regular wave in yang 2017 a hybrid active and passive controller is designed to improve the system dynamics in fbs however system damping in the laminate floating beam structure is relatively hard to be evaluated especially in the effect of uncertain ocean hydromechanics since system damping may has significant effect to the beam structures riyansyah 2009 it is more meaningful to study fbs with unknown system damping to the best of our knowledge there is no research to study this problem for fbs in the literatures the main purpose of this paper is to design a novel boundary controller on two boundaries to suppress the vibration on fbs subject to the description of the specialized governing equations marine structures usually are a laminate structure patel 1989 in the literature the equivalent single layer structure could be effectively used to describe the dynamics of structure with purpose of structural analysis nettles 1994 this strategy is also used in this study the dynamic model of floating beam structure is simulated as a distributed parameter system with euler bernoulli beam structure in the fluid dynamics the incident and reflection effect of regular wave is described as a periodic force the system damping generally includes structural damping and hydrodynamic damping the hydrodynamic damping is affected by ocean environment nikolai 2011 in this study predefined properties and assumptions are given for the derived dynamic model by building proper functional the proposed boundary controllers can be designed and applied on the upstream and downstream boundaries through actuators at the mooring system shown in fig 1 where state observer is used to track the unknown system damping the numerical experiments are carried out to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed controller with various system parameters 2 problem statement in this study fbs found in fig 2 is numerically simulated as a uniform euler bernoulli beam structure the vertical displacement w x t is used to describe the motion of fbs in the regular waves the boundary controllers u l t and v 0 t are respectively acted on the upstream and downstream boundaries for the stabilization of fbs e k t is the kinetic energy of the fbs e p t is the potential energy of the fbs w t is the virtual work on the fbs δ denotes the variational operator x represents the partial derivative of function with

illustrated as 3 e p t 1 2 e i 0 l w x 2 x t d x 1 2 t 0 l w x 2 x t d x where e i is the bending rigidity and t is the tension on fbs the virtual work from ocean wave disturbance in fbs is described as 4 δ w f 0 l f x t δ w x t d x where f x t is the force loaded on fbs due to the incident wave and reflected wave it is assumed that f x t f with a constant f the virtual work from uncertain damping on fbs is given as 5 δ w d 0 l c d w t x t δ w x t d x c d δ w l t c d δ w 0 t where c d is the unknown system damping coefficient of the floating beam structure which mainly includes structure damping and hydrodynamic damping patel 1989 the virtual work from hydrostatic restoring force on fbs is given as δ w r 0 l k c w x t δ w x t d x k c δ w l t k c δ w 0 t where k c is the spring coefficient of the hydrostatic restoring force the virtual work from boundary controller is described as 6 δ w m u l t δ w l t v 0 t δ w 0 t where u l t is control force at the boundary l of fbs v 0 t is control force at the boundary 0 of fbs thus we have the total virtual work done on the floating beam structure as 7 δ w δ w f δ w m δ w d δ w r after the variation operator and integrating equations 2 7 by parts combining the results into hamilton s principle equation 1 we can obtain the governing equation as 8 ρ w t t x t t w x x x t e i w x x x x x t c d w t x t k c w x t f x t with

stability theorem of fbs the following lemmas and assumptions are presented lemma 1 hardy et al 1959 let w x t r be a function defined with x 0 l and t 0 that satisfies the boundary condition w 0 t 0 then the following inequalities hold 12 w 2 x t l 0 l w x 2 x t d x assumption 1 the damping coefficient c d can be lower and upper bounded with c l c d c m where c l and c m are two positive constants 3 control design in this study the objective of control aims to reduce the vibration of fbs with unknown damping and time varying distributed load originated from ocean disturbances in the active controller design the fbs will be stabilized in some neighborhood of its original state with the following theorem theorem 1 for the fbs described by 1 and boundary constraints 2 3 and 4 with the control gains k and k 1 and the positive constants β r g and α we have the active controllers 13 and 14 13 u l t k β α l 0 t w x l t d t β w l t γ 0 t w l t d t c ˆ d l t α l β w x l t γ c ˆ d l t

temporal or spatial integral he et al 2011 w 0 t w l t w x 0 t w x l t w x x x 0 t and w x x x l t could be measured by sensors the other items could be calculated by temporal or spatial integral according to sensor measurement remark 2 equations 17 20 will be applied in the building of layapunov functional for the stabilization of fbs in the appendix 4 simulation results 4 1 verification of the proposed boundary control to illustrate the performance of the controller designed in section 3 finite element method fem is used to simulate the dynamics of fbs where hermitian shape functions and galerkin s method is applied to yield the following fem governing matrix equation suzuki et al 1996 as stated in yang and gao 2016 the generalized wave force f x t acting on the floating beam structure can be written as 21 f x t f a m p sin k x x w f t where f a m p is the amplitude of wave force on the floating beam structure k x is the wave number of ocean wave on the floating beam structure and w f is the angular velocity of ocean wave on the floating beam structure the equivalent principle properties of the floating beam structure are given in table 1 k x is set to 0 1 and w is set to 0 5 rad s the system is uniformly divided into 150 elements and time intervals 0 001 s the time period is set to 100 s the appropriate dynamic performance of fbs could be obtained by the given control parameter values following as k k 1 2 4 10 7 r 1 g 1 β 9 1 10 7 α 310 the comparison of fbs vertical displacement with between no control and the proposed control are illustrated in fig 3 we can find that along the appropriate choice of control parameters the proposed boundary controllers 13 and 14 are able to significantly stabilize the vertical dynamics of fbs in a small neighborhood around zero the non dimensional boundary forces c f l 2 e i c f t are acted on the floating beam structure are shown in fig 4 in the structural design of marine structures the serviceability is of vital importance for marine structures to be an effective platform for land utility in order to quantitatively study this performance of fbs both the peak values and the root mean square rms values of displacement on fbs are considered and defined as following for application 22 m d x max w x t t 0 t 23 j d x 1 t 0 t w 2 x t d t where m d is the displacement peak value at the position x and j d is the displacement rms values at the position x six measurement positions with coordinates 0 m 1000 m 2000 m 3000 m 4000 m and 5000 m are utilized in this study for performance evaluation of fbs the maximum and rms displacement resulted by between no control and the proposed control are described in table 2 we can see the significant improvement of dynamic performance on fbs under the proposed boundary control in contrast there is a reduction of more than 40 on the maximum values of displacement and reduction of more than 35 on the rms values of displacement displacement response of the fbs at different positions is illustrated in fig 5 furthermore we compare the simulation results of the proposed method with the one estimated by yang and guo 2016 in this study we set that actual system damping is 5000 n s m 3 and the design system damping is 1000 n s m 3 the simulation results for these two methods are illustrated in fig 6 it can be found that the proposed method has a better performance on the area close to the boundary one can see that the vibration reduce by more than 15 it would probably because that more appropriate control force has been acted to stabilize the vibration of the boundaries the vibration reduction would significantly improve the comfortability when people work on the area close to boundary area the effect of boundary control will be decreased along the direction of the centre of fbs due to energy absorption by beam structure there is slightly slight improvement in the central area of fbs to further validate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm with the unknown system damping case studies are carried out for various system damping with the range from 100 to 1500 n s m 3 fig 7 a b illustrates the effect of the unknown system damping to the hydroelastic response the variation of rms displacement without control is shown in fig 7 a it could be found that the system damping has a uniform impact on the floating beam structure the hydroelastic response is reduced with increase in damping but the rate of reduction in the rms displacement tends to go down it indicates a drop in the impact of system damping to the hydroelastic response of floating beam structure fig 7 b illustrates the variation of rms displacement with the proposed boundary control one can see that the hydroelastic response on the whole floating beam system decreases with increase in system damping the rate of reduction has a same tendency with the system without control fig 8 illustrates the non dimensional rms control force c f r m s l 2 e i 1 t 0 t c f 2 t d t with various system damping it could be found that the increase of system damping is beneficial to decrease the control force so that the performance of actuator could be improved nevertheless the rate of improvement is going down with increase in system damping 4 2 the effect of ocean wave after the validation to the proposed control methods parametric studies are conducted to demonstrate the effects of ocean wave and bending stiffness on hydroelastic performance of the floating beam system with the same parameter definition in table 1 in order to investigate the effect of ocean wave on hydroelastic response with boundary control hydroelastic analyses are carried out for various wave amplitudes in the range from 5000 to 15000 n and various wave frequencies in the range from 0 4 to 1 0 respectively fig 9 illustrates total rms displacement t d i s p r m s 1 t l 0 l 0 t w 2 x t d t d x of floating beam structure for various wave amplitudes one can see that t d i s p r m s is going up with increase of wave amplitude nevertheless t d i s p r m s has a more significant increase when the floating beam structure freely vibrates without control fig 10 illustrates the non dimensional rms control force c f r m s with various wave amplitudes one can see that c f r m s is notably going up with the increase of wave amplitude thus in order to ensure the effectiveness of the proposed control method we have to choose the actuators with appropriate capacity depending on environmental assessment on the construction field fig 11 illustrates total rms displacement t d i s p r m s of fbs for various wave frequencies it is noted that t d i s p r m s on fbs with free vibration is obviously going up with increase of wave frequency the rate of increase is significantly arising with increase of wave frequency it also could be found that the wave frequency has a little effect to hydroelastic response when the floating beam structure vibrates under a proposed control in addition the control force shown in fig 12 has a little increase with wave frequency therefore we could conclude that the proposed control could effectively reduce the hydroelastic response from the effect of wave frequency 4 3 the effect of elastic rigidity fig 13 illustrates total rms displacement of fbs for various elastic rigidities one can see that compared with the hydroelastic response on free vibration hydroelastic response on the controlled fbs could be reduced to a comfort level for land utility purpose both t d i s p r m s with control and without control are going down with increase of wave elastic rigidity however the rate of improvement is gradually declining with increase of elastic rigidity furthermore the rms displacements along the fbs with various elastic rigidities are shown in fig 14 a and b it could be found from fig 14 a that the bending rigidities in the range from 0 5 1013 to 1 3 1013 nm have a great influence on hydroelastic response on the front portion of the floating beam system but has less effect to the middle and rear portion of the floating beam system it is same as the results with experiments by riyansyah 2009 it could be because that more energy is absorbed by the front portion of the floating beam system with higher bending stiffness fig 14 b illustrates the variation of rms displacement with the proposed boundary control one can see that the hydroelastic response decreases on the whole floating beam system as the rigid stiffness ei increases which is consistent with the illustration from equation a29 it is probably because the boundary controller could further prevent the propagation of the ocean wave energy from the front portion of the floating beam under the boundary control there is a more than 60 reduction of the rms displacement on the whole floating beam system when the bending stiffness increases from 0 5 1013 nm to 1 3 1013 nm fig 15 demonstrates the variation of the total rms input force with elastic rigidity one can see that along the performance improvement of hydroelastic response on the system the input control forces have an insignificant increase with elastic rigidity the rate of increase is reduced with increase in elastic rigidity it is obviously illustrated that the boundary control with an appropriate choice of the bending stiffness could more effectively improve the comfort and safety of the floating beam system 5 conclusion in this study we investigate the fbs system with unknown damping under regular waves the dynamic model of fbs is obtained by the hamilton s principle an appropriate boundary controller with state observer is recommended to strengthen the dynamic performance of fbs with unknown damping
