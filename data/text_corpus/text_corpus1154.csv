5770,the origin and effect of hydraulic resistances on the rate of ageing of radial collector wells are identified through numerical hydrodynamic analysis the research includes hydrodynamic modeling of one such well with new laterals at belgrade well field the performance of the laterals is aggravated by rapid ageing the change in the hydraulic parameters of the laterals during the first decade of operation is analyzed through simulations of the groundwater regime with realistically specified geometries and hydraulics of the laterals contrary to previous investigations two genetically different types of clogging were identified the initial hydraulic resistances are a result of colmation due to the gravel pack grain sizes and screen slot sizes being mismatched with the sand and gravel sediments of the aquifer deposited at the depth of the laterals colmation affects the hydraulic performance of the laterals well ageing is aggravated by incrustation caused by high iron concentrations in the captured groundwater the research highlights a strong correlation between increasing resistances at the laterals on account of iron precipitation and groundwater entrance velocities at the laterals it is possible to differentiate between colmation and incrustation and accurately define the increase in resistances at the laterals by specifying known thicknesses of the near lateral screen zones and quantifying hydraulic conductivities of those zones modflow usg code and connected linear network process package are recommended for simulating laterals and defining real rather than hydraulically equivalent characteristics of the laterals as an approach to hydrodynamic investigations relating to radial collector wells keywords colmation incrustation groundwater modeling modflow usg connected linear network process 1 introduction intergranular aquifers in alluvial plains of large rivers owing to their considerable spread thickness and hydraulic connection with surface water are among the most significant drinking water sources on a global scale in such natural circumstances the operation of a groundwater source is often based on bank filtration ray et al 2002 schubert 2002 and radial collector wells are a relatively frequent groundwater abstraction method of choice hunt et al 2002 natural properties of alluvial aquifers heterogeneous lithology and hydrochemical composition of the groundwater are limiting factors for the installation and operation of radial collector wells both factors are pronounced at belgrade well field with 99 radial collector wells and 900 laterals emplaced to date belgrade well field is one of the largest well fields of this type in the world the average well caisson depth is 24 50 m and the wells have between 3 and 16 laterals each the average number of laterals per well is 8 and their lenght 50 m on average given that the average iron concentration in the abstracted groundwater is 2 04 mg l range from 0 16 to 6 63 mg l dimkić et al 2012 well ageing has been essentially unavoidable since the beginning of belgrade well field development in 1953 as a process well ageing reduces the porosity of the near screen zone and screen due to the deposition products of mechanical chemical or microbial origin van beek 2011 houben and treskatis 2007 the geochemistry of the aquifer matrix in alluvial plains is often such that iron minerals are a substantial component houben 2003 majkić dursun et al 2015 the correlation between the hydraulic performance of wells and iron incrustation has been studied by houben 2006 and van beek 2018 systematic and multidisciplinary investigations of radial collector well ageing at belgrade well field began in 2005 they encompassed all the wells but extensive research focused on five rb 8 rb 15 rb 16 rb 20 and rb 5 m where new laterals were installed between 2005 and 2008 dimkić et al 2011 the new laterals were emplaced by the preussag method which includes a gravel pack aground the lateral screen while the previous steel laterals had been susceptible to corrosion the new laterals were made from non corrodible alloys colmation and incrustation are the only forms of ageing of the renewed wells based on the progress of well ageing at belgrade well field during the first five years of operation with new laterals dimkić et al 2011 and dimkić et al 2012 conclude that a there was negligible initial resistance at the laterals and b incrustation of the laterals during the study period was a function of the iron concentration redox potential of the groundwater and entrance velocities they base these conclusions on the magnitude of the resistance at the laterals quantified through periodic pumping tests however the authors of the present paper analyzed the pumping tests of the first renewed well rb 8 which had been simulated on a hydrodynamic model by dimkić et al 2010 and contrary to their report found that there were in fact considerable initial resistances as well as a dramatic increase in the resistances at the laterals of this well after a very short time houben 2015 provides a detailed analysis of the effect of resistance components on the flow field while groundwater is captured by tube wells houben 2015 concludes that the hydraulic effect of the skin layer is dominant among the resistance components associated with the well itself and that as a rule the effects of the gravel pack and the resistance to the flow through the screen slots and within the well caisson are negligible in view of the fact that the emplacement of horizontal laterals is a mechanical procedure with neither drilling fluid with chemical additives nor fine cuttings from the drilling process involved which are a frequent cause of tube well head loss a skin layer around a lateral can only be formed through the accumulation of fine grained aquifer material even in such cases the skin layer can relatively easily be removed from the contact contour between the lateral and the porous medium by appropriate development of the laterals the effectiveness of development can be assessed by quantifying hydraulic resistances on the basis of a pumping test that is why the identification of the causes of initial resistances at radial wells with newly emplaced laterals within the scope of the research reported in this paper focused on examining the effect of the gravel pack and any colmation layer on the lateral screen which was one of the possible causes of skin layer formation examined by barrash et al 2006 in a case study in hydrodynamic modeling of radial collector wells hydraulic performance of a lateral is represented by its resistance coefficient which is indicative of the resistance to the infiltration of groundwater from the aquifer into the lateral bakker et al 2005 kelson 2012 mohamed and rushton 2006 in the present case the approach described by lee et al 2010 and park and zhan 2002 was followed according to which the coefficient of leakage of a lateral represents the hydraulic conductivity to thickness ratio of the near screen zone the initial assumption of the research was that setting of the near screen zone thickness in the hydrodynamic model will make it possible to define the real hydraulic conductivity of that zone including critical values that might have led to the initial resistances of the laterals the ratio of the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone immediately upon emplacement of the laterals to the hydraulic conductivity of the porous sediments at the elevation of the laterals was deemed to be a representative indicator of colmation as a potential cause of the initial resistances at the laterals another hypothesis behind the hydrodynamic analysis was that over operating time the initial resistances at the laterals increased due to incrustation i e iron precipitation as such the objective was to determine to what extent the overall resistances at the new laterals were a result of two genetically different types of clogging according to houben et al 2018 increasing resistances where there is a high iron concentration in the groundwater are a result of decreasing porosity of the gravel pack lower permeability and screen to address the problem at hand a methodology was developed and applied through which the reduced porosity of the gravel pack was simulated by decreasing the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone over time the rate of iron incrustation depends on the operating mode of the well it was expressed using groundwater entrance velocities at the laterals if the rate of groundwater abstraction is increased by increasing the drawdown in the well caisson the discharge capacity of the well will also increase as will the groundwater flow velocity in the near screen zone in cases where entrance velocities exceed critical values iron precipitation within the pore volume of the near screen zone intensifies and reduces the porosity of the near screen zone or that of the gravel pack in the examined case as the pore volume for free groundwater flow within the gravel pack decreases the entrance velocities continue to increase even at the same pumping rate houben et al 2018 entrance velocities higher than critical thus keep contributing to the rate of clogging the present research included hydrodynamic analyses involving 3d numerical hydrodynamic modeling the hydrodynamic model was developed in the modflow usg code and the laterals were simulated by the numerical package connected linear network process cln panday et al 2013 the laterals were specified with actual geometric and structural characteristics length and diameter of screen pipe thickness of near screen zone as was the hydraulic mechanism of groundwater abstraction controlled drawdown in the well caisson the present hydrodynamic study addresses one of the five renewed wells designation rb 5 m where four new laterals 50 m long diameter ø250 mm gravel pack were emplaced at the beginning of 2008 compared to previous hydrodynamic research the present study followed the approach where well ageing is analyzed by simulating continuous operation of the well rather than occasional pumping tests with realistically represented structural characteristics of the laterals quantified real rather than hydraulically equivalent leakage characteristics of the laterals the effect of the sava river which is the main source of aquifer recharge represented by detailed river stage discretization inflow from the hinterland specified by time variable groundwater levels registered at observation wells and the hydrogeology and hydrodynamics of the aquifer modeled in detail 2 study area and development of hydrogeological model belgrade well field is formed in alluvial sediments of the sava river along its most downstream course a length of 55 km up to the confluence with the danube well rb 5 m is located on the right bank the well is at a distance of 13 km from the sava danube confluence and the well caisson at a distance of 120 m from the sava river channel the model domain and set boundary conditions are shown in fig 1 the model domain includes neighboring radial collector wells deemed to be potentially influenced by well rb 5 m and or vice versa these are wells rb 4 m and rb 6 m on the right bank and wells rb 45 rb 46 and rb 47 on the left bank of the sava the studied well is adjacent to the adica river branch which surrounds a small island on the right bank of the sava the branch was dammed at its upstream end several decades ago but its downstream end remains connected to the sava at a distance of 250 m from well rb 5 m four new laterals were emplaced in 2008 applying the preussag technology the laterals comprise a 45 m long bridge slot screen 5 m long solid blind pipe adjacent to the caisson and gravel pack around the screen the screen slot sizes i e bridge heights and grain sizes of the gravel pack vary along each lateral the laterals are not fully horizontal their deviation from the horizontal plane is not uniform and varies from 0 2 to 1 8 m the hydrochemistry of the captured groundwater is not favorable the concentration of bivalent iron is 2 8 mg l the total iron concentration 3 5 mg l and the redox potential around 85 mv dimkić et al 2011 the belgrade aquifer is composed of holocene and pleistocene sediments formed in a tectonically predisposed depositional setting of the sava trench marović et al 2002 toljić et al 2014 the stratification includes multiple interchanges of generally coarse grained river bedload gravels and sands as well as floodplain deposits of a typical silty and clayey composition the grain size diversity of the strata suggests short transport times and rapid deposition of geologic material the thickness of the aquifer in the study area is 20 25 m detailed hydrogeological discretization of the study area was undertaken for modeling purposes by developing a 3d hydrogeological model data were analyzed from nearly 150 exploratory boreholes of which 20 were in the immediate zone of well rb 5 m the discretization principle was based on parts of the aquifer profile or hydrogeologic lithostratigraphic layers composed of sediments with similar lithological compositions and grain size distributions similar hydrogeological properties and the same genetic origin bedload or floodplain oxbow deposits fig 2 is a 3d visualization of the hydrogeological hg model in the immediate vicinity of well rb 5 m with real spatial positions of the structural components of the well and incision geometries of the sava river and the adica branch in the modeled hg layers the youngest sediments in the study area are recent alluvial bedload deposits of clay and silt hg layer 1 in fig 2 due to their poor hydraulic conductivity and an average thickness of 4 m in the well zone in the hydrogeological sense these deposits represent a semi permeable cap rock that protects the aquifer relatively well against pollution from the land surface the holocene bedload sediments hg layers 2 and 3 in fig 2 are represented by relatively uniform fine to coarse grained sands with gravelly sands at the base the pleistocene bedload deposits were created during warm temperate stages of the lower and middle pleistocene through several consecutive sedimentation cycles they are referred to in the literature as the makiš strata layers with corbicula fluminalis polycyclic sediments and recently as layers with pleistocene corbicula gaudényi et al 2015 nenadić et al 2016 common to all the cycles is that as a rule the base is composed of gravel and sand which transition with depth into sands of varying grain sizes occasionally with some fine grained gravel and almost without exception with a certain proportion of silt these strata are identified as hg layers 5 6 8 and 10 in fig 2 the thickness of the pleistocene sediments in the study area is 10 15 m the final units of each cycle are floodplain deposits which occur in the form of lenses and interbeds hg layers 4 7 and 9 in fig 2 their lithology is composed of silty clay and sandy silt the thickness is in the centimeter to meter range in certain cases exploratory drilling revealed that some of the sedimentation cycles were missing or incomplete which is indicative of intensive erosion at the base of the bedload stage of the next cycle based on the results of 3d hg modeling among the floodplain deposits the sediments of the final stages of the second sedimentation cycle hg layer 7 have the greatest spread in plan view within the zone of influence of well rb 5 m these are clayey and sandy silts whose average thickness is 0 2 m along the vertical this unit is generally found around an elevation of 53 5 m or 3 m above the elevation of the new laterals the lower boundary of the alluvial sediments and the underlying strata in the study area are represented by plio pleistocene lacustrine palustrine sediments hg layer 11 they are composed of various clays silts and clayey and silty sands in places with lenses highly enriched with iron and manganese oolites around well rb 5 m they are found at a depth of 23 5 m elevation 49 m fig 2 shows how the hg layers were translated into hydrodynamic hd model layers hydrogeological units 4 and 9 were disregarded in hydrodynamic modeling because of their minor local spread and sporadic presence within the zone of the laterals the conclusion was that they did not have a significant effect on groundwater levels within the zone of influence of the well in the hydrodynamic model the aquifer cap rock is represented by hd layer i given that the holocene bedload sediments were water bearing hg layers 2 and 3 and that their spread was continuous in the hg model domain they were represented in the hd model by a single unit hd layer ii using the same principle the bedload deposits of the youngest pleistocene sedimentation cycle hg layers 5 and 6 were represented by hd layer iii in the hd discretization semi permeable floodplain deposits modeled as hg layer 7 were set as continuous within the immediate zone of well rb 5 m and hd layer iv the bedload deposits of the second pleistocene cycle hg layer 8 were represented by hd layer v and the oldest bedload sediments hg layer 10 by hd layer vi in view of the lithology and thickness the formations in hg layer 11 could with a high level of certainty be modeled as impermeable strata underlying the alluvial aquifer they were therefore left out of the hd model 3 3d hd modeling approach in the hd model the study area was generally represented by a grid of 16 16 m squares in plan view however quadtree refinement was applied within a zone slightly larger than that of the rb 5 m laterals where groundwater level gradients were the most pronounced and there was real 3d flow fig 3 such that the size of the cells around the well was reduced to 2 2 m in order to arrive at the real initial hydraulic parameters of the new laterals of well rb 5 m as well as their variation over operating time the model was used to assess the groundwater regime throughout the post rehabilitation period of the well the well was put into operation at the end of april 2008 the hd analysis included the period from 1 may 2008 to 30 september 2018 the simulated period was 3805 days long given the simulated period of nearly 10 5 years the duration of a single discrete simulation interval was determined such that changes in the sava stage were modeled in sufficient detail keeping in mind that the sava is the main source of belgrade aquifer recharge the simulation time step was five days with three exceptions meaning that there were 761 simulation intervals or stress periods the groundwater regime elements needed for model calibration were available from 120 stress periods the parameters needed to simulate well hydraulics and ageing of its laterals included well discharge capacity individual capacities of the laterals measured multiple times water levels in the well caisson and groundwater levels at observation wells in the immediate and extended zones of the well the water level in the well caisson hw or the pumping water level was not monitored continuously as such it had to be discretized this was achieved by setting within a single schematized time interval the groundwater level registered on the ground on a certain day date which fell within that particular five day time step between two field observations especially while the pumping water level declined continually from mid november 2010 to the end of march 2013 the pumping water level was discretized by analyzing data from other aquifer regime elements observed in the meantime piezometric heads and stages of the sava river the laterals of well rb 5 m were also realistically simulated in terms of their geometry the specified diameter of the screen was ø250 mm and the length 45 0 m the thickness of the gravel pack around the screen was set at d 0 085 m the specified laterals reflected the pre determined vertical deviations modflow usg and cln process support modeling of one dimensional connected objects whose cross sectional area is much smaller than that of the surrounding grid cells with no effect of such domain discretization on the model outputs panday et al 2013 even though the diameter of the laterals was small there was no need for the discrete cells within the zone of the laterals to be smaller than the otherwise used size of 2 2 m to achieve a numerical solution of required accuracy hydraulic resistances or losses in the near screen zone were represented by a hydraulic parameter leakage coefficient of the laterals which is the ratio of the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone to the thickness of that zone knsz d lee et al 2010 park and zhan 2002 dimkić et al 2010 describe the effects of incrustation by quantifying the change in the leakage coefficient over time of the new laterals of a rehabilitated well the same leakage coefficient of a lateral can be obtained by setting entirely different values of individual lateral resistance components hydraulic conductivity of the near lateral zone and its thickness if the thickness of that zone is inadequate too large in the model the hydraulic conductivity will be excessively high however the ratio of two resistance components will provide a lateral leakage coefficient that will ensure successful calibration of the model satisfactory fit of calculated and registered groundwater levels at observation wells and radial collector well discharge capacities in the present research the installed gravel pack was deemed to be the near screen zone kgp knsz given that the new laterals of well rb 5 m were of the preussag type and in view of the fact that there were indications of initial resistances at the laterals based on the difference between the water levels measured in the well caisson inside the laterals and the groundwater levels registered at nearby observation wells it was assumed that the thickness of the gravel pack near screen zone was constant during the study period and that the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone varied over time for that reason the variation in the hydraulic parameters of the laterals and the increase in resistances at the laterals were represented by varying the hydraulic coefficient of the near screen zone consequently the past approach to hydrodynamic analyses of radial collector well ageing was upgraded in that the change reduction in hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone of the laterals knsz represented ageing colmation and incrustation of the laterals rather than their leakage coefficient knsz d as far as the authors are aware this was the first time the above approach was successfully demonstrated in hydrodynamic studies of radial collector well ageing the methodology is summarized in fig 4 in view of the fact that variations in the sava s stages the well s water levels and the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone affected the discharge capacity of the well and groundwater levels the piezometric head and velocity field within the well zone changed in each stress period for that reason model calibration required a large number of iterations for each of the 120 stress periods each was calibrated to a satisfactory level of accuracy with regard to the observed and calculated well discharge capacities the differences were 1 2 l s and piezometric heads differences in the centimeter range only after as a rule several tens of repeated runs even though the specified neighboring wells were simplified compared to rb 5 m they too required calibration in terms of observed discharge capacities which had been declining during the studied decade due to ageing as well as groundwater levels that were consequently rising the connected linear network process upgraded β version included in the groundwater vistas interface rumbaugh and rumbaugh 2011 was used to simulate the laterals of well rb 5 m cln is an integral part of the modflow usg code and a professional standard in 3d simulations and analyses of groundwater flow based on a grid of unstructured cells and a system of differential equations founded upon the control volume finite difference method panday et al 2013 cln has successfully been used to simulate the laterals of real radial collector wells božović et al 2015 dahlstrom et al 2015 the advantage of using cln to simulate laterals lies in the fact that the hydraulic mechanism of groundwater abstraction and the geometry of the laterals can realistically be represented in the model as such in the general case calibration provides hydraulic characteristics of the laterals in the specific case of well rb 5 m the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone was defined as lee et al 2010 point out solving problems that involve radial collector wells by hydrodynamic modeling requires proper representation of three components of groundwater flow i within the aquifer ii from the aquifer to the radial collector well and iii within the laterals mathematical treatment of in well hydraulics and the selection of the internal boundary condition uniform flux or uniform head to represent the flow within the laterals are key to the success of the simulation of a well groundwater flow from the aquifer to the laterals along the lateral screen is non uniform and non linear as such uniform head provides a better approximation of the actual state than uniform flux kawecki 2000 park and zhan 2002 zhan 1999 however chen et al 2003 claim that the uniform head boundary condition is not true because there are always certain axial resistances along the center line of a horizontal well and consequently a decrease in the groundwater level which also applies to the laterals of the horizontal collector well so the question arises which of the two boundary conditions is adequate in the specific case to answer this question the decrease in the groundwater levels within the laterals or the flow velocity and friction resistance need to be determined bakker et al 2005 munson et al 2009 in view of the number and diameter of the laterals and the average and maximum well capacity during the study period qave 25 l s qmax 60 l s the groundwater flow velocity inside the laterals is low and the effect of the internal resistance practically negligible such that the average decline in groundwater levels along the laterals is less than δh 1 5 cm this leads to the conclusion that the selection of the uniform head approach represented by a constant head boundary condition in the hydrodynamic model is substantiated as a result of such representation of the laterals the flow to a lateral will be the highest at its end and will decline as it nears the well caisson because of the decreasing difference between the groundwater level in the aquifer adjacent to the lateral and the groundwater level within the lateral the decrease in groundwater levels along the lateral as well is in the flow into the lateral also depends on the influence of the other laterals their individual capacities and mutual distances therefore the effect is the smallest at the ends of the laterals and increases toward the well caisson a cln shortfall is associated with the constant head boundary condition used to represent the water level in the well caisson i e inside the laterals contrary to head dependent flux boundary conditions drain river or ghb the constant head boundary condition does not involve setting of the conductance coefficient that is why the values of hydraulic conductivity and thickness of the near screen zone were constant in the model during the simulations given that in the case of well rb 5 m the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone varied over time due to incrustation of the laterals each calibrated time period was treated as a separate model hence the limitation of the constant head boundary condition required the entire time period covered by the hd model to be divided into the number of models equal to the number of field observations of well discharge capacities and groundwater levels on which the calibration was based the hydraulic conductivities of the near screen zone identified in each of these models of shorter duration several months ensured successful calibration it follows from the above that the use of a constant head boundary condition to represent the water level in the well requires a lot of model calibration work 3 1 boundary conditions consistent with past experience gained from hydrodynamic analyses of belgrade well field radial collector wells božović et al 2015 dimkić et al 2010 the neighboring wells were represented by a boundary condition of known specified capacity whereas well rb 5 m was simulated as an actual radial collector well using the head dependent flux boundary condition hdf the hdf boundary condition was also used to simulate the effects of hydrology and piezometric head on the model s outer contours anderson and woessner 1992 bear and cheng 2010 the hdf boundary condition using the river package simulated the sava river and its adica branch this boundary condition was set based on daily river stage data with no decrease in the water surface gradient due to model size given that river channel geometry data was available channel incision into the hd model layers was defined two zones of different depths of channel incision into the aquifer sediments were identified the shallower zone was specified with the riverbed at an elevation of 63 m and the deeper zone at 61 m in both cases the fine grained riverbed deposits of the sava were set with a thickness of one meter and the hydraulically equivalent permeability the representative hydraulic conductivity of the sava riverbed sediments is ksava 3 75 10 7 m s the third type of boundary condition using the general head boundary package simulated the time variable piezometric head on the outer contours of the model in the hinterland of the series of wells on the left and right banks of the sava river the locations on which this boundary condition was set was determined based on the positions of the observation wells in the hinterland of the radial collector wells on the right bank the boundary condition was deeper inland relative to the left bank boundary this allowed the effect of aquifer recharge from the hinterland to be modeled more accurately in order to define the piezometric heads to be set within the boundary condition the groundwater level gradients from the river to the hinterland were defined by constructing piezometric profiles and correlating groundwater levels at available observation wells with the stages of the sava the neighboring radial collector wells featured a lower level of detail and were represented as equivalent large diameter tube wells by setting a known time variable well discharge capacity neumann s boundary condition if exploratory drilling within the zone of the neighboring wells had detected the presence of a semi permeable interbed or several interbeds in which case they were represented by the lithologically and hydrodynamically dominant interbed it was set in the model in accordance with the 3d hg schematization the hd layer in which this boundary condition was set was selected based on the elevation of the laterals of the well in question the hydraulic conductivity of the zone that corresponded to the spread of the laterals of a neighboring well was adjusted until calibration to set real pumping capacities resulted in satisfactory aquifer drawdowns recorded at the observation wells from the perspective of the task at hand the most important boundary condition was the radial collector well or its lateral the capacity of the lateral is a function of the difference between the piezometric head of the aquifer and the water level inside the lateral via the near screen zone whose hydraulic parameters determine the rate of groundwater exchange between the aquifer and the lateral which is in effect the inflow into the lateral eq 1 lee et al 2012 park and zhan 2002 hence in this case too hdf was the boundary condition haitjema et al 2010 kelson 2012 1 q l 2 r π l k nsz d h out h w where ql is the flow from the aquifer to the lateral capacity of the lateral r is the screen radius l is the screen length knsz is the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone d is the thickness of the near screen zone and hout and hw are piezometric heads immediately outside and inside of the lateral the difference between them represents the piezometric head decrease or hydraulic loss in the near screen zone the water level inside the laterals was assumed to be equivalent to that in the well caisson hydraulic resistances to the flow through the screen pipe were disregarded because of the low groundwater flow velocities which is consistent with the results reported by houben 2015 given that the aquifer is overlain by semi permeable sediments of considerable thickness and in view of the depth to groundwater aquifer recharge on account of infiltration of precipitation has no visible effect consequently modeling disregarded the elements of the vertical water balance the model was calibrated by trial and error the representativeness of the model was tested by calculating the model calibration error with regard to the groundwater level residuals and groundwater balance or in other words the difference between the model inflow and outflow anderson woesner 1992 statistical indicators root mean squared error rms and scaled root mean squared error srms were used to quantify the overall goodness of fit of the modeled and observed groundwater levels 4 results and discussion the representativeness analysis of the hydrodynamic model indicated small errors in the residuals table 1 with regard to the groundwater balance the statistical indications showed that the errors were well below 1 leading to the conclusion that the calibrated model was plausible calibration of the hydrodynamic model aimed to provide answers to questions regarding the presence of resistances at the laterals upon installation and variations over operating time the results of model calibration are shown below for the immediate zone of horizontal collector well rb 5 m 4 1 reconstruction of the well s operating mode it became clear from testing undertaken at the very beginning of the study period in early may 2008 that radial collector wells need to be tested by methods other than step testing or short single drawdown testing fig 5 in may 2008 testing began at a pumping rate of 70 l s which was reduced over seven days to 55 l s at the end of the test the water level inside the well was constant throughout the test the decrease in capacity was a result of aquifer drawdown in the zone of influence of the well as well as a slight river stage decline as such the decrease in the difference between the water level inside the well and the groundwater level resulted in a decreasing rate of groundwater withdrawal it follows that a certain time is required for the radius of influence of a radial collector well to increase and quasi steady hydrodynamic conditions to be achieved at least in the case of belgrade well field in mid may 2008 the operating mode of the well stabilized at a water level in the well caisson of hw 64 50 m above sea level with a height of the water column in the well of 14 m above the elevation of the new laterals the intensity of the operating conditions was low such conditions existed throughout the first year and resulted in a pumping rate of only qw 20 25 l s the calculated entrance velocities along the contours of the lateral screens were v 1 40 1 75 10 4 m s after one year at the end of may 2009 the withdrawal rate was intensified by lowering the water level in the well caisson by an additional 3 5 m or to an elevation of hw 61 00 m which was a monitored test of sorts for a short time the capacity of the well increased to more than 35 l s entrance velocities were v 2 50 10 4 m s until the end of 2009 the pumping water levels were in the hw 60 50 61 50 m elevation range and the capacity varied from qw 25 to 30 l s depending on hydrology entrance velocities of v 1 75 2 25 10 4 m s corresponded to these pumping rates the capacity of the well continued to decline to decelerate the ageing process the water level in the caisson was raised and maintained in an elevation range of hw 66 50 67 50 m however despite the reduced loading the capacity of the well continued to decline and was less than 10 l s in the spring of 2010 in an attempt to increase the discharge capacity the first of three mechanical rehabilitations of the new laterals was undertaken in the summer of 2010 belgrade well field has been following a standardized rehabilitation protocol for decades which involves a series of mechanical procedures for each lateral separately rehabilitation begins with jetting of the lateral screen at a water pressure of up to 150 bar using various rotary nozzles water is then pumped into the lateral at a rate of 35 l s followed by compressed air at 7 bar finally the lateral is rapidly opened and closed by means of a special fast closing gate valve this method hydraulically impacts the near screen zone and the lateral screen causing entrance velocities several times higher than during the course of normal operation the rehabilitation procedure continues until all iron deposits have been removed from the laterals as determined by water turbidity analyses until the water runs clear and until the near screen zone is stabilized corroborated by sampling and testing of fine grained material in the water as a result of the first rehabilitation iron encrustations were removed from the pore volumes of the gravel packs to increase their effective porosity and thus improve the hydraulic function of the laterals enhance well performance and increase the well s discharge capacity the operating mode of the well after the first rehabilitation was virtually the same as that after the well was placed online following the emplacement of new laterals from mid august to mid november 2010 the water level in the caisson was at an elevation of hw 64 50 m and the pumping rate was qw 25 30 l s then the well drawdown increased again to hw 61 25 62 70 m and resulted in a capacity increase to more than 40 l s and for a short time in synergy with high stages of the sava to as much as 50 l s however this increase in discharge capacity did not stabilize over time thereafter a passable pumping rate of qw 25 35 l s was achieved by lowering the water level in the caisson after march 2012 the operation of the well was highly strained with groundwater levels at less than 5 m above the elevation of the laterals this situation lasted until june 2012 when the laterals were rehabilitated for the second time after the second rehabilitation the operating mode of the well reverted to the water level at hw 55 40 m above sea level and lasted until the end of winter 2015 when the third rehabilitation was undertaken between the second and third rehabilitations the capacity of the well declined from qw 55 l s and corresponding entrance velocities of v 4 00 10 4 m s to less than 15 l s following the third rehabilitation the well was put into operation with a water level in the caisson at an elevation of hw 65 50 m and a pumping rate higher than 30 l s over the next several months the pumping water level was in the hw 64 00 65 00 m range and the capacity declined from qw 30 l s to qw 15 l s keeping in mind that a rehabilitation had been carried out only a few months earlier in mid 2015 the water level in the well was lowered once again to increase the pumping rate the water level was set at hw 56 00 m and was not changed from the time of the last lowering of the water level inside the well middle of 2015 to the end of the study period end of september 2018 the capacity of the well declined from nearly 30 l s to qw 10 l s a fourth rehabilitation is scheduled in the autumn of 2019 4 2 groundwater levels in the zone of influence of well rb 5m the operating history of the well as described above resulted in complex groundwater levels within the zone of influence of abstraction for a clearer depiction fig 6 shows groundwater level fluctuations at five out of nine available observation wells it is evident that observation wells rb 5m p 1 and ps 239 11 exhibit unique responses but that there are no considerable piezometric head differences among observation wells put 5m 1 put 5m 3 and put 5m 5 apparently there was an additional drawdown in the shallow part of the aquifer hd layers ii and iii after the second rehabilitation indicating that the spread of the interbed hd layer iv was not significant beyond the zone of the laterals and that the sediments are not impermeable consequently the interbed sediments on the location of well rb 5m were justifiably deemed to be semi permeable hydrogeologic formations whose contribution to the increase in resistances to groundwater flow through the aquifer is considerable the filtration characteristics of the interbed sediments are such that when the well is operational the shallow part of the aquifer is under the dominant influence of hydrological conditions river stages of the sava whereas the deeper part of the aquifer hd layers v and vi are under the influence of the operating well the differences in groundwater levels recorded by observation wells whose screens are above ps 239 11 put 5m 1 and put 5m 5 and below rb 5m p 1 the interbed corroborate this claim when the radial collector well was offline e g for rehabilitation at all the observation wells in the immediate zone of the radial collector well except for put 5m 3 which is at a distance of 300 m in the hinterland regardless of the positions of their screens the quasi steady groundwater levels were virtually the same increased resistances to groundwater flow through the near screen zone and the screen slots is believed to be a direct consequence of incrustation of the laterals over service time this increase was manifested by an increasing difference between the groundwater levels in the aquifer and inside the laterals accompanied by a decline in well discharge capacity representative groundwater monitoring points are therefore essential for any study of the ageing process and for quantifying the hydraulic resistances at radial collector well laterals representative monitoring points are observation wells within the spread of the laterals preferably adjacent to the laterals whose screens are short and whose vertical positions correspond to the elevations of the laterals božović et al 2016 polomčić et al 2016 it was not until observation well rb 5m p 1 was built at the end of 2010 that the true nature of the aquifer regime within the zone of influence of the production well was revealed the difference between the piezometric head registered by that representative observation well and the nearest shallow observation well put 5m 5 was time variable depending on the capacity of the radial collector well and the river stage of the sava at a radial collector well capacity of qw 25 30 l s the difference in piezometric heads between these two observation wells was 4 m even at low pumping rates qw less than 20 l s the aquifer drawdown at observation well rb 5m p 1 was considerable this led to the conclusion that there are substantial resistances to groundwater flow through the aquifer and that natural hydrogeological conditions on the location of radial collector well rb 5m are of low potential in terms of groundwater abstraction the reasons are pronounced stratification and modest hydraulic conductivity of the deposited sediments aggravated by high iron concentrations in the groundwater from mid july to the end of october 2012 the stage of the sava river was low hsava 70 20 m a s l which corresponds to a stage of 85 duration during that time the piezometric head at all the observation wells rose less at some more at others depending on the distance from the laterals the capacity of the nearest lateral the total capacity of the radial collector well the positions of the observation well screens in relation to both the geologic framework and the elevation of the laterals etc groundwater levels rose on account of a reduced pumping rate due to incrustation of the laterals with iron from the groundwater the contribution of groundwater flow from the hinterland was analyzed via piezometric heads at observation wells put 5m 1 and put 5m 3 located at a distance of 70 m and 300 m from the radial collector well caisson respectively when the discharge capacity of the radial collector well was low qw 20 l s and the stage of the sava around the multiyear average hsava 71 20 m a s l the two observation wells recorded virtually identical groundwater levels when the stage of the sava was low groundwater levels at put 5m 3 were higher than at put 5m 1 which was indicative of the gradient from the hinterland to the radial collector well and the river i e recharge from the hinterland when the river stage suddenly decreased the decline gradient at put 5m 1 was much steeper than at put 5m 3 the reason was that groundwater abstraction at times of reduced recharge from infiltration of river water spends static groundwater reserves to be replenished when river stages increase again this effect is pronounced in the immediate zone of the radial collector well and decreases with distance from the well when the river stage suddenly increased the piezometric head at put 5m 1 rose much more quickly than at put 5m 3 indicating high rates of aquifer recharge from the river and the river branch when river stages were generally low the groundwater level at observation well ps 239 11 was consistent with those observed at the other shallow observation wells at times when river stages were elevated or high the groundwater levels at this observation well were almost equal to the sava s stages regardless of the discharge capacity of the radial collector well even at a pumping rate of about qw 50 l s at the end of 2012 fig 6 shows that the activation threshold of sudden groundwater level increases at observation well ps 239 11 is around an elevation of 71 20 m which corresponds to the multiyear average stage of the sava pronounced fluctuation amplitudes at observation well ps 239 11 are indicative of an active hydraulic connection between the adica branch as the source of recharge of the aquifer in the immediate zone of well rb 5 m at sudden river stage increases or decreases the differences between the observed and calculated groundwater levels at the location of this observation well were more pronounced the reason was that under such hydrological conditions the actual daily river stages differed from the modeled 5 day averages in addition the change in water surface width of the river branch at high stages and local changes in branch channel geometry e g eroded right bank in the immediate vicinity of observation well ps 239 11 were not represented in detail in the hydrodynamic model 4 3 identification of representative characteristics of the aquifer sediments and the sava river and adica branch deposits calibration of the hydrodynamic model provided representative hydraulic conductivities of each layer interlayer that modeled the water bearing framework in the zone of influence of the studied radial collector well the hydraulic conductivity of the sediments that overlie the aquifer hd layer i was k 1 0 10 7 m s the hydraulic conductivities of the shallow section of the water bearing strata were lower than of the sediments at the depths of the laterals the holocene deposits hd layer ii and bedload deposits of the youngest pleistocene cycle of alluvial sedimentation hd layer iii featured a hydraulic conductivity of k 9 0 10 5 m s the hydraulic conductivity of the floodplain sediments hd layer iv was k 5 0 10 7 m s and certainly reflected the hydrodynamic role of the interbed the bedload sediments of the first and second pleistocene cycles hd layers v and vi or hg layers 8 and 10 had a hydraulic conductivity of k 3 5 10 4 m s a difference was determined between the vertical and horizontal components of hydraulic conductivity in all alluvial deposits within the zone of well rb 5 m except in recent overlaying sediments hd layer i anisotropy was kz 0 1 kx y the other hydraulic parameters were specific yield sy 0 1 specific storage ss 1 0 10 4 m 1 and porosity n 0 15 the reason for the modest hydraulic characteristics of the porous medium and the existence of anisotropy likely lies in the proportion of the silty fraction in the build up of the water bearing largely sand and gravel sediments model calibration identified a representative leakage coefficient of the sava s riverbed deposits of ksava d 3 75 10 7 s 1 the leakage coefficient of the adica branch riverbed was higher kadica d 1 0 10 6 s 1 the reason for this is believed to be the fact that the branch connects with the main stream in its downstream part and that the branch is fed with river water from its downstream to upstream end i e in the direction opposite to the flow of the sava as such the suspended sediment from the river is deposited at the mouth of the branch where the flow energy dissipates consequently there is less bedload along the river branch and the hydraulic contact between the branch and the water bearing strata is more direct 4 4 quantification of hydraulic parameters of laterals and variation over time during the first two and a half years of operation of radial collector well rb 5m there was no adequate observation well with a short screen in the part of the aquifer where the new laterals were emplaced to monitor groundwater levels within the zone of the laterals as a result the hydraulic parameters pertaining to that period were defined based on groundwater level data from the observation wells whose screens are in the shallow part of the aquifer and the capacity of the radial collector well the simulations were conducted with all laterals having the same hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone this time period is identified in fig 7 as nl 1 4 nl new lateral the changes in resistances at the laterals exhibited both negative and positive directions the parameters of the laterals deteriorated on account of incrustation and improved as a result of mechanical rehabilitation at the beginning of operation the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone of the new laterals was k1 4 nsz 3 5 10 5 m s this is undoubtedly a very low value an order of magnitude smaller that the representative hydraulic conductivity of the layers in which the laterals are emplaced specifically it corresponds to the vertical component of hydraulic conductivity during the first year the hydraulic parameters of the laterals did not change a decline in hydraulic parameters began immediately after the groundwater withdrawal rate increased because the pumping water level was lowered at the end of may 2009 this led to the deterioration of the initial hydraulic characteristics of the laterals that the reduction in the groundwater withdrawal capability of the laterals was considerable is evidenced by the fact that in four months of operation the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone of the laterals decreased by a factor of almost six to k1 4 nsz 6 0 10 6 m s the trend decelerated only after the pumping rate was reduced to 25 l s i e when the groundwater entrance velocities dropped to v 1 50 10 4 m s the first rehabilitation of the laterals was effective in that the hydraulic function of the laterals was renewed the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone of the laterals reverted to initial conditions for as long as the well was operated under normal conditions small drawdown after the rehabilitation there was no loss of the achieved effect however after the water level in the caisson was lowered in november 2010 the hydraulic parameters of the laterals began to deteriorate once again for no other reason than iron incrustation of the laterals facilitated by increased groundwater entrance velocities to the laterals after the representative observation well rb 5m p 1 was built at the end of november 2010 and the real hydrodynamic regime of the aquifer in the zone of influence of the radial collector well became apparent it was possible to individually quantify the hydraulic parameters of the laterals the change in hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone of lateral 1 was defined via groundwater levels at the nearest observation well rb 5m p 1 and of lateral 4 via those at observation well ps 239 11 adjacent to that lateral there was no observation well near laterals 2 and 3 because they were emplaced below the adica branch as such it was not possible to separately quantify the hydraulic characteristics of those laterals in the model in the ongoing hydrodynamic analysis they were specified with a common hydraulic conductivity nl 2 3 fig 7 from the very beginning of the study of ageing of the individual laterals it was evident that there were differences in hydraulic performance these differences increased over operating time for example immediately prior to the second rehabilitation the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone of lateral 1 was k1 nsz 8 5 10 6 m s of lateral 4 k4 nsz 3 0 10 6 m s and of laterals 2 and 3 k2 3 nsz 1 5 10 7 m s modeling did not provide a reliable indication whether the second rehabilitation too managed to improve hydraulic parameters to their initial levels the reason was that the first observations of groundwater levels at the observation wells were undertaken one month after the radial collector well became operational again end of july 2012 keeping in mind the decrease in the groundwater withdrawal capability of the laterals during the first month after the first and third rehabilitations as well as the forceful operating mode of the radial collector well after the second rehabilitation entrance velocities greater than v 4 00 10 4 m s it is likely that the second rehabilitation was equally effective in that case in the first month of operation the initial hydraulic conductivities were reduced to the observed k1 nsz 2 0 10 5 m s knsz 4 1 75 10 5 m s and k2 3 nsz 1 5 10 5 m s prior to the third regeneration the resistances at the laterals were high and the differences among them pronounced in early february 2015 the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone of lateral 1 was k1 nsz 2 75 10 6 m s of lateral 4 k4 nsz 1 25 10 6 m s and of laterals 2 and 3 k2 3 nsz 3 5 10 7 m s the third rehabilitation effectively removed chemical encrustations from the pore volumes of the gravel packs so that hydraulic conductivity reverted to initial levels however once the radial collector well was placed online the laterals began to age again and the process generally continued at a steady pace through to the end of september 2015 at which time the pumping capacity was again 25 l s at the end of the study period the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone of lateral 1 was only k1 nsz 1 5 10 6 m s and of 2 3 and 4 much lower the results of the hydrodynamic study provided arguments for the origin of the initial resistances however a comprehensive and clear conclusion required an assessment of the technical characteristics of the incorporated material and its suitability to the aquifer sediments at the elevations and along the routing of the laterals 5 critical analysis of the screen slot sizes and the gravel pack grain sizes of the new laterals per the applied preussag technology the geologic material was sampled every five meters of the casings for grain size distribution analyses in the field using a standard set of sieves the technical characteristics of the incorporated material were defined based on the results for this assessment data were available on slot sizes of the bridged screen and gravel pack grain sizes the percentage of screen porosity was unknown grain size distribution curves were constructed to gain insight into the grain size distribution of the clastic sediments at the elevation and along the routing of the laterals they are shown separately for each lateral in fig 8 since the fine silty fraction could not be preserved during sampling from the caisson while the casings were installed the samples were of a disturbed nature it was evident that the sediments were very heterogeneous sand and gravels whose typical 50 grain diameter was d50 0 4 5 0 mm or d50 1 4 mm on average also at the elevation of the laterals there were crosswise interchanges of sediments when a production well requires a gravel pack around the screen the characteristics of the gravel pack are determined from the grain size distribution of the aquifer matrix blair 1970 williams 1981 the procedure involves defining the pack aquifer ratio where the aquifer sediments are represented by a typical grain diameter based on the coefficient of grain uniformity commonly d50 the generally accepted rule is that the pack aquifer ratio should be between 4 and 6 saucier 1974 in view of the different lithology and varying grain size distribution of the sediments along the laterals as well as their pronounced non uniformity the grain size of the gravel pack along the laterals needs to vary in general for sections of the laterals where d50 1 0 mm 72 5 of the samples the grain size of a commercially available gravel pack should be 4 8 mm for finer grained intervals along the laterals a suitable gravel pack would be 2 4 mm or 3 5 mm with a longer development procedure the thickness of the installed gravel pack meets the criteria recommended by sterrett 2007 and williams 1981 the screen slots are sized so that they correspond to the 10 grain size on the gravel pack curve sterrett 2007 the corresponding slot size for the new laterals of well rb 5 m would be h 4 mm in the case of coarse grained intervals for mostly sandy sections the height of the bridge should be h 2 mm or h 3 mm if the pack is coarser and development of the laterals longer based on the characteristics of the construction material shown in table 2 it is clear that they are inconsistent with gravel pack grain size and screen slot size criteria the finest fraction of the pack 1 2 mm was installed along a considerable portion of laterals 2 and 3 there the screen opening is h 0 8 mm which is too small on average the pack aquifer ratio is less than 2 which according to saucier 1974 reduces the permeability of the pack the gravel packs of laterals 1 and 4 are coarser and their screen slot sizes larger owing to favorable hydraulic parameters laterals 1 and 4 individually withdrew larger amounts of water and had higher entrance velocities than laterals 2 and 3 contrary to expectations the rate of chemical incrustation of laterals 1 and 4 was lower 6 conclusion the reported research focused on reliably identifying the presence origin and impact of initial hydraulic resistances on rapid ageing of new laterals on one of five radial collector wells at the belgrade well field where new laterals were installed about a decade ago the research involved simulation of the achieved groundwater regime on a hydrodynamic model with realistically represented geometry and hydraulics of the laterals and the groundwater abstraction mechanism the results were as follows initial resistances were present since the very beginning of operation of the new laterals of the studied well rb 5 m they limited hydraulic performance in terms of groundwater abstraction to a considerable extent the initial resistances predisposed rapid well ageing through incrustation of the laterals due to high iron concentrations in the groundwater and the abstraction mode expressed via groundwater entrance velocities at the laterals the initial resistances were a result of inconsistencies between the grain size of the gravel pack and the size of the screen slots on the one hand and grain size distributions of the aquifer matrix at the elevation and along the routing of the laterals given that the pack is of a quartz mineral composition and the laterals made from corrosion resistant steel the functional constraints of the laterals are of a permanent nature coarser grain sizes of the pack resulted in larger pore volumes within the near screen zone which required more time to be filled with products of iron precipitation on the other hand a finer than optimal pack reduced the effective porosity of the near screen zone and accelerated incrustation even where entrance velocities were low when assessing ageing of radial collector wells i e the deterioration of hydraulic parameters of its laterals over time quantification of the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone of the laterals is the superior approach compared to defining the variation in the leakage coefficient of the laterals colmation of water wells is generally seen as a process whereby fine grains of the porous medium are moved by the energy of the flow and accumulate because they cannot pass through the screen slots the results of the present study indicated that a manifestation of this type although genetically different does not diverge from the initially disturbed hydraulic capability of the laterals wells because of improper sizing of the gravel pack and screen slots author contributions đorđije božović

5770,the origin and effect of hydraulic resistances on the rate of ageing of radial collector wells are identified through numerical hydrodynamic analysis the research includes hydrodynamic modeling of one such well with new laterals at belgrade well field the performance of the laterals is aggravated by rapid ageing the change in the hydraulic parameters of the laterals during the first decade of operation is analyzed through simulations of the groundwater regime with realistically specified geometries and hydraulics of the laterals contrary to previous investigations two genetically different types of clogging were identified the initial hydraulic resistances are a result of colmation due to the gravel pack grain sizes and screen slot sizes being mismatched with the sand and gravel sediments of the aquifer deposited at the depth of the laterals colmation affects the hydraulic performance of the laterals well ageing is aggravated by incrustation caused by high iron concentrations in the captured groundwater the research highlights a strong correlation between increasing resistances at the laterals on account of iron precipitation and groundwater entrance velocities at the laterals it is possible to differentiate between colmation and incrustation and accurately define the increase in resistances at the laterals by specifying known thicknesses of the near lateral screen zones and quantifying hydraulic conductivities of those zones modflow usg code and connected linear network process package are recommended for simulating laterals and defining real rather than hydraulically equivalent characteristics of the laterals as an approach to hydrodynamic investigations relating to radial collector wells keywords colmation incrustation groundwater modeling modflow usg connected linear network process 1 introduction intergranular aquifers in alluvial plains of large rivers owing to their considerable spread thickness and hydraulic connection with surface water are among the most significant drinking water sources on a global scale in such natural circumstances the operation of a groundwater source is often based on bank filtration ray et al 2002 schubert 2002 and radial collector wells are a relatively frequent groundwater abstraction method of choice hunt et al 2002 natural properties of alluvial aquifers heterogeneous lithology and hydrochemical composition of the groundwater are limiting factors for the installation and operation of radial collector wells both factors are pronounced at belgrade well field with 99 radial collector wells and 900 laterals emplaced to date belgrade well field is one of the largest well fields of this type in the world the average well caisson depth is 24 50 m and the wells have between 3 and 16 laterals each the average number of laterals per well is 8 and their lenght 50 m on average given that the average iron concentration in the abstracted groundwater is 2 04 mg l range from 0 16 to 6 63 mg l dimkić et al 2012 well ageing has been essentially unavoidable since the beginning of belgrade well field development in 1953 as a process well ageing reduces the porosity of the near screen zone and screen due to the deposition products of mechanical chemical or microbial origin van beek 2011 houben and treskatis 2007 the geochemistry of the aquifer matrix in alluvial plains is often such that iron minerals are a substantial component houben 2003 majkić dursun et al 2015 the correlation between the hydraulic performance of wells and iron incrustation has been studied by houben 2006 and van beek 2018 systematic and multidisciplinary investigations of radial collector well ageing at belgrade well field began in 2005 they encompassed all the wells but extensive research focused on five rb 8 rb 15 rb 16 rb 20 and rb 5 m where new laterals were installed between 2005 and 2008 dimkić et al 2011 the new laterals were emplaced by the preussag method which includes a gravel pack aground the lateral screen while the previous steel laterals had been susceptible to corrosion the new laterals were made from non corrodible alloys colmation and incrustation are the only forms of ageing of the renewed wells based on the progress of well ageing at belgrade well field during the first five years of operation with new laterals dimkić et al 2011 and dimkić et al 2012 conclude that a there was negligible initial resistance at the laterals and b incrustation of the laterals during the study period was a function of the iron concentration redox potential of the groundwater and entrance velocities they base these conclusions on the magnitude of the resistance at the laterals quantified through periodic pumping tests however the authors of the present paper analyzed the pumping tests of the first renewed well rb 8 which had been simulated on a hydrodynamic model by dimkić et al 2010 and contrary to their report found that there were in fact considerable initial resistances as well as a dramatic increase in the resistances at the laterals of this well after a very short time houben 2015 provides a detailed analysis of the effect of resistance components on the flow field while groundwater is captured by tube wells houben 2015 concludes that the hydraulic effect of the skin layer is dominant among the resistance components associated with the well itself and that as a rule the effects of the gravel pack and the resistance to the flow through the screen slots and within the well caisson are negligible in view of the fact that the emplacement of horizontal laterals is a mechanical procedure with neither drilling fluid with chemical additives nor fine cuttings from the drilling process involved which are a frequent cause of tube well head loss a skin layer around a lateral can only be formed through the accumulation of fine grained aquifer material even in such cases the skin layer can relatively easily be removed from the contact contour between the lateral and the porous medium by appropriate development of the laterals the effectiveness of development can be assessed by quantifying hydraulic resistances on the basis of a pumping test that is why the identification of the causes of initial resistances at radial wells with newly emplaced laterals within the scope of the research reported in this paper focused on examining the effect of the gravel pack and any colmation layer on the lateral screen which was one of the possible causes of skin layer formation examined by barrash et al 2006 in a case study in hydrodynamic modeling of radial collector wells hydraulic performance of a lateral is represented by its resistance coefficient which is indicative of the resistance to the infiltration of groundwater from the aquifer into the lateral bakker et al 2005 kelson 2012 mohamed and rushton 2006 in the present case the approach described by lee et al 2010 and park and zhan 2002 was followed according to which the coefficient of leakage of a lateral represents the hydraulic conductivity to thickness ratio of the near screen zone the initial assumption of the research was that setting of the near screen zone thickness in the hydrodynamic model will make it possible to define the real hydraulic conductivity of that zone including critical values that might have led to the initial resistances of the laterals the ratio of the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone immediately upon emplacement of the laterals to the hydraulic conductivity of the porous sediments at the elevation of the laterals was deemed to be a representative indicator of colmation as a potential cause of the initial resistances at the laterals another hypothesis behind the hydrodynamic analysis was that over operating time the initial resistances at the laterals increased due to incrustation i e iron precipitation as such the objective was to determine to what extent the overall resistances at the new laterals were a result of two genetically different types of clogging according to houben et al 2018 increasing resistances where there is a high iron concentration in the groundwater are a result of decreasing porosity of the gravel pack lower permeability and screen to address the problem at hand a methodology was developed and applied through which the reduced porosity of the gravel pack was simulated by decreasing the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone over time the rate of iron incrustation depends on the operating mode of the well it was expressed using groundwater entrance velocities at the laterals if the rate of groundwater abstraction is increased by increasing the drawdown in the well caisson the discharge capacity of the well will also increase as will the groundwater flow velocity in the near screen zone in cases where entrance velocities exceed critical values iron precipitation within the pore volume of the near screen zone intensifies and reduces the porosity of the near screen zone or that of the gravel pack in the examined case as the pore volume for free groundwater flow within the gravel pack decreases the entrance velocities continue to increase even at the same pumping rate houben et al 2018 entrance velocities higher than critical thus keep contributing to the rate of clogging the present research included hydrodynamic analyses involving 3d numerical hydrodynamic modeling the hydrodynamic model was developed in the modflow usg code and the laterals were simulated by the numerical package connected linear network process cln panday et al 2013 the laterals were specified with actual geometric and structural characteristics length and diameter of screen pipe thickness of near screen zone as was the hydraulic mechanism of groundwater abstraction controlled drawdown in the well caisson the present hydrodynamic study addresses one of the five renewed wells designation rb 5 m where four new laterals 50 m long diameter ø250 mm gravel pack were emplaced at the beginning of 2008 compared to previous hydrodynamic research the present study followed the approach where well ageing is analyzed by simulating continuous operation of the well rather than occasional pumping tests with realistically represented structural characteristics of the laterals quantified real rather than hydraulically equivalent leakage

well field is formed in alluvial sediments of the sava river along its most downstream course a length of 55 km up to the confluence with the danube well rb 5 m is located on the right bank the well is at a distance of 13 km from the sava danube confluence and the well caisson at a distance of 120 m from the sava river channel the model domain and set boundary conditions are shown in fig 1 the model domain includes neighboring radial collector wells deemed to be potentially influenced by well rb 5 m and or vice versa these are wells rb 4 m and rb 6 m on the right bank and wells rb 45 rb 46 and rb 47 on the left bank of the sava the studied well is adjacent to the adica river branch which surrounds a small island on the right bank of the sava the branch was dammed at its upstream end several decades ago but its downstream end remains connected to the sava at a distance of 250 m from well rb 5 m four new laterals were emplaced in 2008 applying the preussag technology the laterals comprise a 45 m long bridge slot screen 5 m long solid blind pipe adjacent to the caisson and gravel pack around the screen the screen slot sizes i e bridge heights and grain sizes of the gravel pack vary along each lateral the laterals are not fully horizontal their deviation from the horizontal plane is not uniform and varies from 0 2 to 1 8 m the hydrochemistry of the captured groundwater is not favorable the concentration of bivalent iron is 2 8 mg l the total iron concentration 3 5 mg l and the redox potential around 85 mv dimkić et al 2011 the belgrade aquifer is composed of holocene and pleistocene sediments formed in a tectonically predisposed depositional setting of the sava trench marović et al 2002 toljić et al 2014 the stratification includes multiple interchanges of generally coarse grained river bedload gravels and sands as well as floodplain deposits of a typical silty and clayey composition the grain size diversity of the strata suggests short transport times and rapid deposition of geologic material the thickness of the aquifer in the study area is 20 25 m detailed hydrogeological discretization of the study area was undertaken for modeling purposes by developing a 3d hydrogeological model data were analyzed from nearly 150 exploratory boreholes of which 20 were in the immediate zone of well rb 5 m the discretization principle was based on parts of the aquifer profile or hydrogeologic lithostratigraphic layers composed of sediments with similar lithological compositions and grain size distributions similar hydrogeological properties and the same genetic origin bedload or floodplain oxbow deposits fig 2 is a 3d visualization of the hydrogeological hg model in the immediate vicinity of well rb 5 m with real spatial positions of the structural components of the well and incision geometries of the sava river and the adica branch in the modeled hg layers the youngest sediments in the study area are recent alluvial bedload deposits of clay and silt hg layer 1 in fig 2 due to their poor hydraulic conductivity and an average thickness of 4 m in the well zone in the hydrogeological sense these deposits represent a semi permeable cap rock that protects the aquifer relatively well against pollution from the land surface the holocene bedload sediments hg layers 2 and 3 in fig 2 are represented by relatively uniform fine to coarse grained sands with gravelly sands at the base the pleistocene bedload deposits were created during warm temperate stages of the lower and middle pleistocene through several consecutive sedimentation cycles they are referred to in the literature as the makiš strata layers with corbicula fluminalis polycyclic sediments and recently as layers with pleistocene corbicula gaudényi et al 2015 nenadić et al 2016 common to all the cycles is that as a rule the base is composed of gravel and sand which transition with depth into sands of varying grain sizes occasionally with some fine grained gravel and almost without exception with a certain proportion of silt these strata are identified as hg layers 5 6 8 and 10 in fig 2 the thickness of the pleistocene sediments in the study area is 10 15 m the final units of each cycle are floodplain deposits which occur in the form of lenses and interbeds hg layers 4 7 and 9 in fig 2 their lithology is composed of silty clay and sandy silt the thickness is in the centimeter to meter range in certain cases exploratory drilling revealed that some of the sedimentation cycles were missing or incomplete which is indicative of intensive erosion at the base of the bedload stage of the next cycle based on the results of 3d hg modeling among the floodplain deposits the sediments of the final stages of the second sedimentation cycle hg layer 7 have the greatest spread in plan view within the zone of influence of well rb 5 m these are clayey and sandy silts whose average thickness is 0 2 m along the vertical this unit is generally found around an elevation of 53 5 m or 3 m above the elevation of the new laterals the lower boundary of the alluvial sediments and the underlying strata in the study area are represented by plio pleistocene lacustrine palustrine sediments hg layer 11 they are composed of various clays silts and clayey and silty sands in places with lenses highly enriched with iron and manganese oolites around well rb 5 m they are found at a depth of 23 5 m elevation 49 m fig 2 shows how the hg layers were translated into hydrodynamic hd model layers hydrogeological units 4 and 9 were disregarded in hydrodynamic modeling because of their minor local spread and sporadic presence within the zone of the laterals the conclusion was that they did not have a significant effect on groundwater levels within the zone of influence of the well in the hydrodynamic model the aquifer cap rock is represented by hd layer i given that the holocene bedload sediments were water bearing hg layers 2 and 3 and that their spread was continuous in the hg model domain they were represented in the hd model by a single unit hd layer ii using the same principle the bedload deposits of the youngest pleistocene sedimentation cycle hg layers 5 and 6 were represented by hd layer iii in the hd discretization semi permeable floodplain deposits modeled as hg layer 7 were set as continuous within the immediate zone of well rb 5 m and hd layer iv the bedload deposits of the second pleistocene cycle hg layer 8 were represented by hd layer v and the oldest bedload sediments hg layer 10 by hd layer vi in view of the lithology and thickness the formations in hg layer 11 could with a high level of certainty be modeled as impermeable strata underlying the alluvial aquifer they were therefore left out of the hd model 3 3d hd modeling approach in the hd model the study area was generally represented by a grid of 16 16 m squares in plan view however quadtree refinement was applied within a zone slightly larger than that of the rb 5 m laterals where groundwater level gradients were the most pronounced and there was real 3d flow fig 3 such that the size of the cells around the well was reduced to 2 2 m in order to arrive at the real initial hydraulic parameters of the new laterals of well rb 5 m as well as their variation over operating time the model was used to assess the groundwater regime throughout the post rehabilitation period of the well the well was put into operation at the end of april 2008 the hd analysis included the period from 1 may 2008 to 30 september 2018 the simulated period was 3805 days long given the simulated period of nearly 10 5 years the duration of a single discrete simulation interval was determined such that changes in the sava stage were modeled in sufficient detail keeping in mind that the sava is the main source of belgrade aquifer recharge the simulation time step was five days with three exceptions meaning that there were 761 simulation intervals or stress periods the groundwater regime elements needed for model calibration were available from 120 stress periods the parameters needed to simulate well hydraulics and ageing of its laterals included well discharge capacity individual capacities of the laterals measured multiple times water levels in the well caisson and groundwater levels at observation wells in the immediate and extended zones of the well the water level in the well caisson hw or the pumping water level was not monitored continuously as such it had to be discretized this was achieved by setting within a single schematized time interval the groundwater level registered on the ground on a certain day date which fell within that particular five day time step between two field observations especially while the pumping water level declined continually from mid november 2010 to the end of march 2013 the pumping water level was discretized by analyzing data from other aquifer regime elements observed in the meantime piezometric heads and stages of the sava river the laterals of well rb 5 m were also realistically simulated in terms of their geometry the specified diameter of the screen was ø250 mm and the length 45 0 m the thickness of the gravel pack around the screen was set at d 0 085 m the specified laterals reflected the pre determined vertical deviations modflow usg and cln process support modeling of one dimensional connected objects whose cross sectional area is much smaller than that of the surrounding grid cells with no effect of such domain discretization on the model outputs panday et al 2013 even though the diameter of the laterals was small there was no need for the discrete cells within the zone of the laterals to be smaller than the otherwise used size of 2 2 m to achieve a numerical solution of required accuracy hydraulic resistances or losses in the near screen zone were represented by a hydraulic parameter leakage coefficient of the laterals which is the ratio of the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone to the thickness of that zone knsz d lee et al 2010 park and zhan 2002 dimkić et al 2010 describe the effects of incrustation by quantifying the change in the leakage coefficient over time of the new laterals of a rehabilitated well the same leakage coefficient of a lateral can be obtained by setting entirely different values of individual lateral resistance components hydraulic conductivity of the near lateral zone and its thickness if the thickness of that zone is inadequate too large in the model the hydraulic conductivity will be excessively high however the ratio of two resistance components will provide a lateral leakage coefficient that will ensure successful calibration of the model satisfactory fit of calculated and registered groundwater levels at observation wells and radial collector well discharge capacities in the present research the installed gravel pack was deemed to be the near screen zone kgp knsz given that the new laterals of well rb 5 m were of the preussag type and in view of the fact that there were indications of initial resistances at the laterals based on the difference between the water levels measured in the well caisson inside the laterals and the groundwater levels registered at nearby observation wells it was assumed that the thickness of the gravel pack near screen zone was constant during the study period and that the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone varied over time for that reason the variation in the hydraulic parameters of the laterals and the increase in resistances at the laterals were represented by varying the hydraulic coefficient of the near screen zone consequently the past approach to hydrodynamic analyses of radial collector well ageing was upgraded in that the change reduction in hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone of the laterals knsz represented ageing colmation and incrustation of the laterals rather than their leakage coefficient knsz d as far as the authors are aware this was the first time the above approach was successfully demonstrated in hydrodynamic studies of radial collector well ageing the methodology is summarized in fig 4 in view of the fact that variations in the sava s stages the well s water levels and the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone affected the discharge capacity of the well and groundwater levels the piezometric head and velocity field within the well zone changed in each stress period for that reason model calibration required a large number of iterations for each of the 120 stress periods each was calibrated to a satisfactory level of accuracy with regard to the observed and calculated well discharge capacities the differences were 1 2 l s and piezometric heads differences in the centimeter range only after as a rule several tens of repeated runs even though the specified neighboring wells were simplified compared to rb 5 m they too required calibration in terms of observed discharge capacities which had been declining during the studied decade due to ageing as well as groundwater levels that were consequently rising the connected linear network process upgraded β version included in the groundwater vistas interface rumbaugh and rumbaugh 2011 was used to simulate the laterals of well rb 5 m cln is an integral part of the modflow usg code and a professional standard in 3d simulations and analyses of groundwater flow based on a grid of unstructured cells and a system of differential equations founded upon the control volume finite difference method panday et al 2013 cln has successfully been used to simulate the laterals of real radial collector wells božović et al 2015 dahlstrom et al 2015 the advantage of using cln to simulate laterals lies in the fact that the hydraulic mechanism of groundwater abstraction and the geometry of the laterals can realistically be represented in the model as such in the general case calibration provides hydraulic characteristics of the laterals in the specific case of well rb 5 m the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone was defined as lee et al 2010 point out solving problems that involve radial collector wells by hydrodynamic modeling requires proper representation of three components of groundwater flow i within the aquifer ii from the aquifer to the radial collector well and iii within the laterals mathematical treatment of in well hydraulics and the selection of the internal boundary condition uniform flux or uniform head to represent the flow within the laterals are key to the success of the simulation of a well groundwater flow from the aquifer to the laterals along the lateral screen is non uniform and non linear as such uniform head provides a better approximation of the actual state than uniform flux kawecki 2000 park and zhan 2002 zhan 1999 however chen et al 2003 claim that the uniform head boundary condition is not true because there are always certain axial resistances along the center line of a horizontal well and consequently a decrease in the groundwater level which also applies to the laterals of the horizontal collector well so the question arises which of the two boundary conditions is adequate in the specific case to answer this question the decrease in the groundwater levels within the laterals or the flow velocity and friction resistance need to be determined bakker et al 2005 munson et al 2009 in view of the number and diameter of the laterals and the average and maximum well capacity during the study period qave 25 l s qmax 60 l s the groundwater flow velocity inside the laterals is low and the effect of the internal resistance practically negligible such that the average decline in groundwater levels along the laterals is less than δh 1 5 cm this leads to the conclusion that the selection of the uniform head approach represented by a constant head boundary condition in the hydrodynamic model is substantiated as a result of such representation of the laterals the flow to a lateral will be the highest at its end and will decline as it nears the well caisson because of the decreasing difference between the groundwater level in the aquifer adjacent to the lateral and the groundwater level within the lateral the decrease in groundwater levels along the lateral as well is in the flow into the lateral also depends on the influence of the other laterals their individual capacities and mutual distances therefore the effect is the smallest at the ends of the laterals and increases toward the well caisson a cln shortfall is associated with the constant head boundary condition used to represent the water level in the well caisson i e inside the laterals contrary to head dependent flux boundary conditions drain river or ghb the constant head boundary condition does not involve setting of the conductance coefficient that is why the values of hydraulic conductivity and thickness of the near screen zone were constant in the model during the simulations given that in the case of well rb 5 m the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone varied over time due to incrustation of the laterals each calibrated time period was treated as a separate model hence the limitation of the constant head boundary condition required the entire time period covered by the hd model to be divided into the number of models equal to the number of field observations of well discharge capacities and groundwater levels on which the calibration was based the hydraulic conductivities of the near screen zone identified in each of these models of shorter duration several months ensured successful calibration it follows from the above that the use of a constant head boundary condition to represent the water level in the well requires a lot of model calibration work 3 1 boundary conditions consistent with past experience gained from hydrodynamic analyses of belgrade well field radial collector wells božović et al 2015 dimkić et al 2010 the neighboring wells were represented by a boundary condition of known specified capacity whereas well rb 5 m was simulated as an actual radial collector well using the head dependent flux boundary condition hdf the hdf boundary condition was also used to simulate the effects of hydrology and piezometric head on the model s outer contours anderson and woessner 1992 bear and cheng 2010 the hdf boundary condition using the river package simulated the sava river and its adica branch this boundary condition was set based on daily river stage data with no decrease in the water surface gradient due to model size given that river channel geometry data was available channel incision into the hd model layers was defined two zones of different depths of channel incision into the aquifer sediments were identified the shallower zone was specified with the riverbed at an elevation of 63 m and the deeper zone at 61 m in both cases the fine grained riverbed deposits of the sava were set with a thickness of one meter and the hydraulically equivalent permeability the representative hydraulic conductivity of the sava riverbed sediments is ksava 3 75 10 7 m s the third type of boundary condition using the general head boundary package simulated the time variable piezometric head on the outer contours of the model in the hinterland of the series of wells on the left and right banks of the sava river the locations on which this boundary condition was set was determined based on the positions of the observation wells in the hinterland of the radial collector wells on the right bank the boundary condition was deeper inland relative to the left bank boundary this allowed the effect of aquifer recharge from the hinterland to be modeled more accurately in order to define the piezometric heads to be set within the boundary condition the groundwater level gradients from the river to the hinterland were defined by constructing piezometric profiles and correlating groundwater levels at available observation wells with the stages of the sava the neighboring radial collector wells featured a lower level of detail and were represented as equivalent large diameter tube wells by setting a known time variable well discharge capacity neumann s boundary condition if exploratory drilling within the zone of the neighboring wells had detected the presence of a semi permeable interbed or several interbeds in which case they were represented by the lithologically and hydrodynamically dominant interbed it was set in the model in accordance with the 3d hg schematization the hd layer in which this boundary condition was set was selected based on the elevation of the laterals of the well in question the hydraulic conductivity of the zone that corresponded to the spread of the laterals of a neighboring well was adjusted until calibration to set real pumping capacities resulted in satisfactory aquifer drawdowns recorded at the observation wells from the perspective of the task at hand the most important boundary condition was the radial collector well or its lateral the capacity of the lateral is a function of the difference between the piezometric head of the aquifer and the water level inside the lateral via the near screen zone whose hydraulic parameters determine the rate of groundwater exchange between the aquifer and the lateral which is in effect the inflow into the lateral eq 1 lee et al 2012 park and zhan 2002 hence in this case too hdf was the boundary condition haitjema et al 2010 kelson 2012 1 q l 2 r π l k nsz d h out h w where ql is the flow from the aquifer to the lateral capacity of the lateral r is the screen radius l is the screen length knsz is the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone d is the thickness of the near screen zone and hout and hw are piezometric heads immediately outside and inside of the lateral the difference between them represents the piezometric head decrease or hydraulic loss in the near screen zone the water level inside the laterals was assumed to be equivalent to that in the well caisson hydraulic resistances to the flow through the screen pipe were disregarded because of the low groundwater flow velocities which is consistent with the results reported by houben 2015 given that the aquifer is overlain by semi permeable sediments of considerable thickness and in view of the depth to groundwater aquifer recharge on account of infiltration of precipitation has no visible effect consequently modeling disregarded the elements of the vertical water balance the model was calibrated by trial and error the representativeness of the model was tested by calculating the model calibration error with regard to the groundwater level residuals and groundwater balance or in other words the difference between the model inflow and outflow anderson woesner 1992 statistical indicators root mean squared error rms and scaled root mean squared error srms were used to quantify the overall goodness of fit of the modeled and observed groundwater levels 4 results and discussion the representativeness analysis of the hydrodynamic model indicated small errors in the residuals table 1 with regard to the groundwater balance the statistical indications showed that the errors were well below 1 leading to the conclusion that the calibrated model was plausible calibration of the hydrodynamic model aimed to provide answers to questions regarding the presence of resistances at the laterals upon installation and variations over operating time the results of model calibration are shown below for the immediate zone of horizontal collector well rb 5 m 4 1 reconstruction of the well s operating mode it became clear from testing undertaken at the very beginning of the study period in early may 2008 that radial collector wells need to be tested by methods other than step testing or short single drawdown testing fig 5 in may 2008 testing began at a pumping rate of 70 l s which was reduced over seven days to 55 l s at the end of the test the water level inside the well was constant throughout the test the decrease in capacity was a result of aquifer drawdown in the zone of influence of the well as well as a slight river stage decline as such the decrease in the difference between the water level inside the well and the groundwater level resulted in a decreasing rate of groundwater withdrawal it follows that a certain time is required for the radius of influence of a radial collector well to increase and quasi steady hydrodynamic conditions to be achieved at least in the case of belgrade well field in mid may 2008 the operating mode of the well stabilized at a water level in the well caisson of hw 64 50 m above sea level with a height of the water column in the well of 14 m above the elevation of the new laterals the intensity of the operating conditions was low such conditions existed throughout the first year and resulted in a pumping rate of only qw 20 25 l s the calculated entrance velocities along the contours of the lateral screens were v 1 40 1 75 10 4 m s after one year at the end of may 2009 the withdrawal rate was intensified by lowering the water level in the well caisson by an additional 3 5 m or to an elevation of hw 61 00 m which was a monitored test of sorts for a short time the capacity of the well increased to more than 35 l s entrance velocities were v 2 50 10 4 m s until the end of 2009 the pumping water levels were in the hw 60 50 61 50 m elevation range and the capacity varied from qw 25 to 30 l s depending on hydrology entrance velocities of v 1 75 2 25 10 4 m s corresponded to these pumping rates the capacity of the well continued to decline to decelerate the ageing process the water level in the caisson was raised and maintained in an elevation range of hw 66 50 67 50 m however despite the reduced loading the capacity of the well continued to decline and was less than 10 l s in the spring of 2010 in an attempt to increase the discharge capacity the first of three mechanical rehabilitations of the new laterals was undertaken in the summer of 2010 belgrade well field has been following a standardized rehabilitation protocol for decades which involves a series of mechanical procedures for each lateral separately rehabilitation begins with jetting of the lateral screen at a water pressure of up to 150 bar using various rotary nozzles water is then pumped into the lateral at a rate of 35 l s followed by compressed air at 7 bar finally the lateral is rapidly opened and closed by means of a special fast closing gate valve this method hydraulically impacts the near screen zone and the lateral screen causing entrance velocities several times higher than during the course of normal operation the rehabilitation procedure continues until all iron deposits have been removed from the laterals as determined by water turbidity analyses until the water runs clear and until the near screen zone is stabilized corroborated by sampling and testing of fine grained material in the water as a result of the first rehabilitation iron encrustations were removed from the pore volumes of the gravel packs to increase their effective porosity and thus improve the hydraulic function of the laterals enhance well performance and increase the well s discharge capacity the operating mode of the well after the first rehabilitation was virtually the same as that after the well was placed online following the emplacement of new laterals from mid august to mid november 2010 the water level in the caisson was at an elevation of hw 64 50 m and the pumping rate was qw 25 30 l s then the well drawdown increased again to hw 61 25 62 70 m and resulted in a capacity increase to more than 40 l s and for a short time in synergy with high stages of the sava to as much as 50 l s however this increase in discharge capacity did not stabilize over time thereafter a passable pumping rate of qw 25 35 l s was achieved by lowering the water level in the caisson after march 2012 the operation of the well was highly strained with groundwater levels at less than 5 m above the elevation of the laterals this situation lasted until june 2012 when the laterals were rehabilitated for the second time after the second rehabilitation the operating mode of the well reverted to the water level at hw 55 40 m above sea level and lasted until the end of winter 2015 when the third rehabilitation was undertaken between the second and third rehabilitations the capacity of the well declined from qw 55 l s and corresponding entrance velocities of v 4 00 10 4 m s to less than 15 l s following the third rehabilitation the well was put into operation with a water level in the caisson at an elevation of hw 65 50 m and a pumping rate higher than 30 l s over the next several months the pumping water level was in the hw 64 00 65 00 m range and the capacity declined from qw 30 l s to qw 15 l s keeping in mind that a rehabilitation had been carried out only a few months earlier in mid 2015 the water level in the well was lowered once again to increase the pumping rate the water level was set at hw 56 00 m and was not changed from the time of the last lowering of the water level inside the well middle of 2015 to the end of the study period end of september 2018 the capacity of the well declined from nearly 30 l s to qw 10 l s a fourth rehabilitation is scheduled in the autumn of 2019 4 2 groundwater levels in the zone of influence of well rb 5m the operating history of the well as described above resulted in complex groundwater levels within the zone of influence of abstraction for a clearer depiction fig 6 shows groundwater level fluctuations at five out of nine available observation wells it is evident that observation wells rb 5m p 1 and ps 239 11 exhibit unique responses but that there are no considerable piezometric head differences among observation wells put 5m 1 put 5m 3 and put 5m 5 apparently there was an additional drawdown in the shallow part of the aquifer hd layers ii and iii after the second rehabilitation indicating that the spread of the interbed hd layer iv was not significant beyond the zone of the laterals and that the sediments are not impermeable consequently the interbed sediments on the location of well rb 5m were justifiably deemed to be semi permeable hydrogeologic formations whose contribution to the increase in resistances to groundwater flow through the aquifer is considerable the filtration characteristics of the interbed sediments are such that when the well is operational the shallow part of the aquifer is under the dominant influence of hydrological conditions river stages of the sava whereas the deeper part of the aquifer hd layers v and vi are under the influence of the operating well the differences in groundwater levels recorded by observation wells whose screens are above ps 239 11 put 5m 1 and put 5m 5 and below rb 5m p 1 the interbed corroborate this claim when the radial collector well was offline e g for rehabilitation at all the observation wells in the immediate zone of the radial collector well except for put 5m 3 which is at a distance of 300 m in the hinterland regardless of the positions of their screens the quasi steady groundwater levels were virtually the same increased resistances to groundwater flow through the near screen zone and the screen slots is believed to be a direct consequence of incrustation of the laterals over service time this increase was manifested by an increasing difference between the groundwater levels in the aquifer and inside the laterals accompanied by a decline in well discharge capacity representative groundwater monitoring points are therefore essential for any study of the ageing process and for quantifying the hydraulic resistances at radial collector well laterals representative monitoring points are observation wells within the spread of the laterals preferably adjacent to the laterals whose screens are short and whose vertical positions correspond to the elevations of the laterals božović et al 2016 polomčić et al 2016 it was not until observation well rb 5m p 1 was built at the end of 2010 that the true nature of the aquifer regime within the zone of influence of the production well was revealed the difference between the piezometric head registered by that representative observation well and the nearest shallow observation well put 5m 5 was time variable depending on the capacity of the radial collector well and the river stage of the sava at a radial collector well capacity of qw 25 30 l s the difference in piezometric heads between these two observation wells was 4 m even at low pumping rates qw less than 20 l s the aquifer drawdown at observation well rb 5m p 1 was considerable this led to the conclusion that there are substantial resistances to groundwater flow through the aquifer and that natural hydrogeological conditions on the location of radial collector well rb 5m are of low potential in terms of groundwater abstraction the reasons are pronounced stratification and modest hydraulic conductivity of the deposited sediments aggravated by high iron concentrations in the groundwater from mid july to the end of october 2012 the stage of the sava river was low hsava 70 20 m a s l which corresponds to a stage of 85 duration during that time the piezometric head at all the observation wells rose less at some more at others depending on the distance from the laterals the capacity of the nearest lateral the total capacity of the radial collector well the positions of the observation well screens in relation to both the geologic framework and the elevation of the laterals etc groundwater levels rose on account of a reduced pumping rate due to incrustation of the laterals with iron from the groundwater the contribution of groundwater flow from the hinterland was analyzed via piezometric heads at observation wells put 5m 1 and put 5m 3 located at a distance of 70 m and 300 m from the radial collector well caisson respectively when the discharge capacity of the radial collector well was low qw 20 l s and the stage of the sava around the multiyear average hsava 71 20 m a s l the two observation wells recorded virtually identical groundwater levels when the stage of the sava was low groundwater levels at put 5m 3 were higher than at put 5m 1 which was indicative of the gradient from the hinterland to the radial collector well and the river i e recharge from the hinterland when the river stage suddenly decreased the decline gradient at put 5m 1 was much steeper than at put 5m 3 the reason was that groundwater abstraction at times of reduced recharge from infiltration of river water spends static groundwater reserves to be replenished when river stages increase again this effect is pronounced in the immediate zone of the radial collector well and decreases with distance from the well when the river stage suddenly increased the piezometric head at put 5m 1 rose much more quickly than at put 5m 3 indicating high rates of aquifer recharge from the river and the river branch when river stages were generally low the groundwater level at observation well ps 239 11 was consistent with those observed at the other shallow observation wells at times when river stages were elevated or high the groundwater levels at this observation well were almost equal to the sava s stages regardless of the discharge capacity of the radial collector well even at a pumping rate of about qw 50 l s at the end of 2012 fig 6 shows that the activation threshold of sudden groundwater level increases at observation well ps 239 11 is around an elevation of 71 20 m which corresponds to the multiyear average stage of the sava pronounced fluctuation amplitudes at observation well ps 239 11 are indicative of an active hydraulic connection between the adica branch as the source of recharge of the aquifer in the immediate zone of well rb 5 m at sudden river stage increases or decreases the differences between the observed and calculated groundwater levels at the location of this observation well were more pronounced the reason was that under such hydrological conditions the actual daily river stages differed from the modeled 5 day averages in addition the change in water surface width of the river branch at high stages and local changes in branch channel geometry e g eroded right bank in the immediate vicinity of observation well ps 239 11 were not represented in detail in the hydrodynamic model 4 3 identification of representative characteristics of the aquifer sediments and the sava river and adica branch deposits calibration of the hydrodynamic model provided representative hydraulic conductivities of each layer interlayer that modeled the water bearing framework in the zone of influence of the studied radial collector well the hydraulic conductivity of the sediments that overlie the aquifer hd layer i was k 1 0 10 7 m s the hydraulic conductivities of the shallow section of the water bearing strata were lower than of the sediments at the depths of the laterals the holocene deposits hd layer ii and bedload deposits of the youngest pleistocene cycle of alluvial sedimentation hd layer iii featured a hydraulic conductivity of k 9 0 10 5 m s the hydraulic conductivity of the floodplain sediments hd layer iv was k 5 0 10 7 m s and certainly reflected the hydrodynamic role of the interbed the bedload sediments of the first and second pleistocene cycles hd layers v and vi or hg layers 8 and 10 had a hydraulic conductivity of k 3 5 10 4 m s a difference was determined between the vertical and horizontal components of hydraulic conductivity in all alluvial deposits within the zone of well rb 5 m except in recent overlaying sediments hd layer i anisotropy was kz 0 1 kx y the other hydraulic parameters were specific yield sy 0 1 specific storage ss 1 0 10 4 m 1 and porosity n 0 15 the reason for the modest hydraulic characteristics of the porous medium and the existence of anisotropy likely lies in the proportion of the silty fraction in the build up of the water bearing largely sand and gravel sediments model calibration identified a representative leakage coefficient of the sava s riverbed deposits of ksava d 3 75 10 7 s 1 the leakage coefficient of the adica branch riverbed was higher kadica d 1 0 10 6 s 1 the reason for this is believed to be the fact that the branch connects with the main stream in its downstream part and that the branch is fed with river water from its downstream to upstream end i e in the direction opposite to the flow of the sava as such the suspended sediment from the river is deposited at the mouth of the branch where the flow energy dissipates consequently there is less bedload along the river branch and the hydraulic contact between the branch and the water bearing strata is more direct 4 4 quantification of hydraulic parameters of laterals and variation over time during the first two and a half years of operation of radial collector well rb 5m there was no adequate observation well with a short screen in the part of the aquifer where the new laterals were emplaced to monitor groundwater levels within the zone of the laterals as a result the hydraulic parameters pertaining to that period were defined based on groundwater level data from the observation wells whose screens are in the shallow part of the aquifer and the capacity of the radial collector well the simulations were conducted with all laterals having the same hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone this time period is identified in fig 7 as nl 1 4 nl new lateral the changes in resistances at the laterals exhibited both negative and positive directions the parameters of the laterals deteriorated on account of incrustation and improved as a result of mechanical rehabilitation at the beginning of operation the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone of the new laterals was k1 4 nsz 3 5 10 5 m s this is undoubtedly a very low value an order of magnitude smaller that the representative hydraulic conductivity of the layers in which the laterals are emplaced specifically it corresponds to the vertical component of hydraulic conductivity during the first year the hydraulic parameters of the laterals did not change a decline in hydraulic parameters began immediately after the groundwater withdrawal rate increased because the pumping water level was lowered at the end of may 2009 this led to the deterioration of the initial hydraulic characteristics of the laterals that the reduction in the groundwater withdrawal capability of the laterals was considerable is evidenced by the fact that in four months of operation the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone of the laterals decreased by a factor of almost six to k1 4 nsz 6 0 10 6 m s the trend decelerated only after the pumping rate was reduced to 25 l s i e when the groundwater entrance velocities dropped to v 1 50 10 4 m s the first rehabilitation of the laterals was effective in that the hydraulic function of the laterals was renewed the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone of the laterals reverted to initial conditions for as long as the well was operated under normal conditions small drawdown after the rehabilitation there was no loss of the achieved effect however after the water level in the caisson was lowered in november 2010 the hydraulic parameters of the laterals began to deteriorate once again for no other reason than iron incrustation of the laterals facilitated by increased groundwater entrance velocities to the laterals after the representative observation well rb 5m p 1 was built at the end of november 2010 and the real hydrodynamic regime of the aquifer in the zone of influence of the radial collector well became apparent it was possible to individually quantify the hydraulic parameters of the laterals the change in hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone of lateral 1 was defined via groundwater levels at the nearest observation well rb 5m p 1 and of lateral 4 via those at observation well ps 239 11 adjacent to that lateral there was no observation well near laterals 2 and 3 because they were emplaced below the adica branch as such it was not possible to separately quantify the hydraulic characteristics of those laterals in the model in the ongoing hydrodynamic analysis they were specified with a common hydraulic conductivity nl 2 3 fig 7 from the very beginning of the study of ageing of the individual laterals it was evident that there were differences in hydraulic performance these differences increased over operating time for example immediately prior to the second rehabilitation the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone of lateral 1 was k1 nsz 8 5 10 6 m s of lateral 4 k4 nsz 3 0 10 6 m s and of laterals 2 and 3 k2 3 nsz 1 5 10 7 m s modeling did not provide a reliable indication whether the second rehabilitation too managed to improve hydraulic parameters to their initial levels the reason was that the first observations of groundwater levels at the observation wells were undertaken one month after the radial collector well became operational again end of july 2012 keeping in mind the decrease in the groundwater withdrawal capability of the laterals during the first month after the first and third rehabilitations as well as the forceful operating mode of the radial collector well after the second rehabilitation entrance velocities greater than v 4 00 10 4 m s it is likely that the second rehabilitation was equally effective in that case in the first month of operation the initial hydraulic conductivities were reduced to the observed k1 nsz 2 0 10 5 m s knsz 4 1 75 10 5 m s and k2 3 nsz 1 5 10 5 m s prior to the third regeneration the resistances at the laterals were high and the differences among them pronounced in early february 2015 the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone of lateral 1 was k1 nsz 2 75 10 6 m s of lateral 4 k4 nsz 1 25 10 6 m s and of laterals 2 and 3 k2 3 nsz 3 5 10 7 m s the third rehabilitation effectively removed chemical encrustations from the pore volumes of the gravel packs so that hydraulic conductivity reverted to initial levels however once the radial collector well was placed online the laterals began to age again and the process generally continued at a steady pace through to the end of september 2015 at which time the pumping capacity was again 25 l s at the end of the study period the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone of lateral 1 was only k1 nsz 1 5 10 6 m s and of 2 3 and 4 much lower the results of the hydrodynamic study provided arguments for the origin of the initial resistances however a comprehensive and clear conclusion required an assessment of the technical characteristics of the incorporated material and its suitability to the aquifer sediments at the elevations and along the routing of the laterals 5 critical analysis of the screen slot sizes and the gravel pack grain sizes of the new laterals per the applied preussag technology the geologic material was sampled every five meters of the casings for grain size distribution analyses in the field using a standard set of sieves the technical characteristics of the incorporated material were defined based on the results for this assessment data were available on slot sizes of the bridged screen and gravel pack grain sizes the percentage of screen porosity was unknown grain size distribution curves were constructed to gain insight into the grain size distribution of the clastic sediments at the elevation and along the routing of the laterals they are shown separately for each lateral in fig 8 since the fine silty fraction could not be preserved during sampling from the caisson while the casings were installed the samples were of a disturbed nature it was evident that the sediments were very heterogeneous sand and gravels whose typical 50 grain diameter was d50 0 4 5 0 mm or d50 1 4 mm on average also at the elevation of the laterals there were crosswise interchanges of sediments when a production well requires a gravel pack around the screen the characteristics of the gravel pack are determined from the grain size distribution of the aquifer matrix blair 1970 williams 1981 the procedure involves defining the pack aquifer ratio where the aquifer sediments are represented by a typical grain diameter based on the coefficient of grain uniformity commonly d50 the generally accepted rule is that the pack aquifer ratio should be between 4 and 6 saucier 1974 in view of the different lithology and varying grain size distribution of the sediments along the laterals as well as their pronounced non uniformity the grain size of the gravel pack along the laterals needs to vary in general for sections of the laterals where d50 1 0 mm 72 5 of the samples the grain size of a commercially available gravel pack should be 4 8 mm for finer grained intervals along the laterals a suitable gravel pack would be 2 4 mm or 3 5 mm with a longer development procedure the thickness of the installed gravel pack meets the criteria recommended by sterrett 2007 and williams 1981 the screen slots are sized so that they correspond to the 10 grain size on the gravel pack curve sterrett 2007 the corresponding slot size for the new laterals of well rb 5 m would be h 4 mm in the case of coarse grained intervals for mostly sandy sections the height of the bridge should be h 2 mm or h 3 mm if the pack is coarser and development of the laterals longer based on the characteristics of the construction material shown in table 2 it is clear that they are inconsistent with gravel pack grain size and screen slot size criteria the finest fraction of the pack 1 2 mm was installed along a considerable portion of laterals 2 and 3 there the screen opening is h 0 8 mm which is too small on average the pack aquifer ratio is less than 2 which according to saucier 1974 reduces the permeability of the pack the gravel packs of laterals 1 and 4 are coarser and their screen slot sizes larger owing to favorable hydraulic parameters laterals 1 and 4 individually withdrew larger amounts of water and had higher entrance velocities than laterals 2 and 3 contrary to expectations the rate of chemical incrustation of laterals 1 and 4 was lower 6 conclusion the reported research focused on reliably identifying the presence origin and impact of initial hydraulic resistances on rapid ageing of new laterals on one of five radial collector wells at the belgrade well field where new laterals were installed about a decade ago the research involved simulation of the achieved groundwater regime on a hydrodynamic model with realistically represented geometry and hydraulics of the laterals and the groundwater abstraction mechanism the results were as follows initial resistances were present since the very beginning of operation of the new laterals of the studied well rb 5 m they limited hydraulic performance in terms of groundwater abstraction to a considerable extent the initial resistances predisposed rapid well ageing through incrustation of the laterals due to high iron concentrations in the groundwater and the abstraction mode expressed via groundwater entrance velocities at the laterals the initial resistances were a result of inconsistencies between the grain size of the gravel pack and the size of the screen slots on the one hand and grain size distributions of the aquifer matrix at the elevation and along the routing of the laterals given that the pack is of a quartz mineral composition and the laterals made from corrosion resistant steel the functional constraints of the laterals are of a permanent nature coarser grain sizes of the pack resulted in larger pore volumes within the near screen zone which required more time to be filled with products of iron precipitation on the other hand a finer than optimal pack reduced the effective porosity of the near screen zone and accelerated incrustation even where entrance velocities were low when assessing ageing of radial collector wells i e the deterioration of hydraulic parameters of its laterals over time quantification of the hydraulic conductivity of the near screen zone of the laterals is the superior approach compared to defining the variation in the leakage coefficient of the laterals colmation of water wells is generally seen as a process whereby fine grains of the porous medium are moved by the energy of the flow and accumulate because they cannot pass through the screen slots the results of the present study indicated that a manifestation of this type although genetically different does not diverge from the initially disturbed hydraulic capability of the laterals wells because of improper sizing of the gravel pack and screen slots author contributions đorđije božović

5771,forest harvesting often decreases soil infiltration capacity leading to rapid and increased delivery of surface runoff shallow subsurface runoff and sediment to streams while the general harvest area is typically the largest area of disturbance relative to forest roads or skid trails less is known about the degree to which the general harvest areas act as sources or sinks for runoff and sediment transport this includes a need to improve understanding of the potential for runoff and sediment delivery from harvest areas through riparian buffers to streams during infrequent high intensity precipitation events which are predicted to increase due to climate change in this study we used rainfall simulations to investigate surface shallow subsurface runoff and sediment transport from plots during extreme precipitation events within a steep headwater catchment in the rocky mountains simulations consisted of one hour of high intensity rainfall i60 70 80 mm h 1 representative of an 100 year or greater storm event for the northern rocky mountain region our objectives were to compare runoff rates sediment concentrations and sediment yields between the general harvest area along the edge of the riparian buffer at the interface with the harvested area and within the riparian buffer surface shallow subsurface runoff rates were greatest in the riparian buffer relative to the harvest area especially when soil conditions were dry mechanical soil disturbance during forest harvesting appeared to result in higher infiltration rates and vertical preferential flow relative to the riparian buffer however sediment concentrations in runoff from plots in the general harvest area were 15 8 times greater than in the riparian buffer and 4 2 times greater than at the harvest riparian edge comparatively sediment yields in the general harvest area were 2 0 times greater than in the riparian buffer and 1 2 times greater than at the harvest riparian edge quantitative and qualitative evidence suggests differences in runoff and sediment between the harvest area harvest riparian edge and riparian buffer were due to site differences in hydrophobicity surface roughness soil water content and sediment supply while we observed moderately high variability with only modest replication the spatial patterns in the amount and timing of runoff sediment production and their relationships with soil moisture were consistent and monotonic along the gradient from harvested areas through riparian buffers this highlights the need for additional research to explore if similar

2016 the hydrologic effects of forest harvesting activities in particular have been the focus of scientific investigation for decades bosch and hewlett 1982 brown et al 2005 stednick 1996 the majority of research has focused on the most compacted surfaces roads and skid trails luce 2002 sheridan et al 2006 sosa perez and macdonald 2017 these highly compacted surfaces decrease the soil infiltration capacity leading to more rapid and increased delivery of surface runoff shallow subsurface runoff and sediment to the stream luce and black 1999 macdonald et al 2001 research has shown an increase of 2 to 100 times more runoff and sediment from roads and skid trails compared to undisturbed surfaces even during low intensity rain events croke et al 1999a luce and black 1999 moreover many studies

equipment is used ampoorter et al 2012 miller et al 1996 heavy machinery such as harvesters skidders and forwarders can compact soils increase bulk density and decrease air filled porosity infiltration capacity and hydraulic conductivity across the general harvest area mohr et al 2013 sidle et al 2006 these effects are spatially heterogeneous leading to uncertainties about the contribution of the harvest area to runoff and sediment croke et al 1999a croke et al 1999b for example in the first two years after forest harvesting oyarzun and pena 1995 observed 1 8 to 3 9 times

less runoff and 54 less soil loss from harvested plots compared to undisturbed plots in indonesian rainforest catchments thus the degree to which the general harvest areas act as sources or sinks for runoff and sediment transport remains unclear mohr et al 2013 wallbrink and croke 2002 historical research 1950s and 1960s on the effects of forest management illustrated that the general harvest area could act as a principal source of increased runoff and sediment brown and krygier 1971 fredriksen 1970 harris 1977 the results from these early studies led to legislation requiring retention of riparian vegetation around streams to protect the freshwater environment cristan et al 2016 recent studies suggest that current best management practices bmps including retention of a riparian buffer are mostly effective at reducing the potential for sediment from general harvest areas to reach streams and negatively impact water quality and aquatic habitat hatten et al 2018 litschert and

precipitation in part due to wetter soil conditions and higher water tables improved understanding of the processes linking runoff and sediment delivery to streams during infrequent high intensity precipitation events are needed to help frame the scope of these predictions in forested environments here we provide insights into the role of the general harvest area and riparian buffer as sources or sinks for runoff and sediment transport during high intensity precipitation events specifically in this study we investigated surface shallow subsurface runoff and sediment transport from plots during extreme precipitation events within a steep headwater catchment recently harvested in the rocky mountains our objectives were to evaluate and compare runoff rates sediment concentrations and sediment yields during high intensity precipitation events between the general harvest area along the edge of the riparian buffer at the interface with the harvested area and within the riparian buffer specifically we used rainfall simulations of high intensity short duration storm events to a quantify surface or shallow sub surface runoff rates b quantify sediment concentrations and yields and c determine the influence of antecedent soil moisture on both runoff and sediment production within the general harvest area along the riparian buffer edge and within the riparian buffer 2 methods

facing with basin elevation ranging from 1479 to 2627 m the average catchment slope is 45 while the average channel slope is 11 wagner et al 2014 forest vegetation in the study catchment is dominated by stands of lodgepole pine pinus contorta var latifolia trembling aspen populus tremuloides and douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii var glauca at lower elevations upper montane at mid elevations sub alpine the vegetation is characterized by engelmann spruce picea engelmanii and subalpine fir abies lasiocarpa while high elevations are alpine meadow vegetation transitioning to talus slopes and bare rock soils are well to imperfectly drained eutric or dystric brunisols inceptisols u s soil taxonomy with weak soil horizon development typical of higher elevation northern environments geology is primarily cretaceous shale sandstone mudstone and limestone winters are typically cold mean monthly air temperature 7 c and summers are mild mean monthly air temperature 16 c the mean annual air temperature is 4 6 c the mean annual precipitation ranges between 800 and 1360 mm year 1 with mean annual streamflow ranging from 600 to 1225 mm year 1 silins et al 2016 precipitation predominantly falls as snow between october and april 50 70 leading to peak streamflow as snowmelt in may june mahat and anderson 2013 star creek west a 458 ha sub basin of the star creek catchment was harvested as a variable retention clearcut between january march 2015 forest harvesting operations consisted of the removal of 62 ha of timber using ground based equipment where felled trees were skidded to landings for processing following harvesting the cutover areas were drag scarified dozer anchor chain and left for natural regeneration this harvest treatment represented contemporary forest management practices in the region and was being compared with two alternative harvesting treatments in the other two sub basins of the star creek catchment as part of the southern rockies watershed project study silins et al 2016 operable areas were restricted to slopes less than 45 a 30 m riparian buffer was retained around all mapped waterbodies 2 2 rainfall simulation plots we selected 15 plots for rainfall simulations along three transects on a north facing hillslope aspect 358 and along two transects on a southeast facing hillslope aspect 129 fig 1 each transect consisted of three plots that were spaced 20 m apart along the planar hillslopes each plot was one square meter which was bounded by a three sided steel frame that was inserted into the soil with the open side facing down the slope the plots were located either a within the general harvest area b along the edge of the riparian buffer at the interface with the harvested area or c within the riparian buffer we characterized each of the 15 plots based on soil texture fig 2 aspect local slope canopy closure foliar and ground cover and litter depth table 1 the soil particle distribution for the sand silt and clay fraction was determined in the laboratory using the hydrometer method gee and or 2002 soil texture for the fine fraction 2 mm of the upper 0 6 cm of mineral soil was similar along the north facing and southeast facing hillslopes ranging from silty loam to silty clay loam fig 2 soil samples contained poorly sorted rocks and gravel estimated to make up 2 20 of the sample volume local plot slopes generally increased from the general harvest area into the riparian buffer table 1 slopes ranged from 13 to 29 within the harvested area 26 42 at the riparian harvest boundary and 36 55 within the riparian buffer canopy closure which is a measure of the portion of the sky hemisphere obscured by the vegetative canopy was estimated using a spherical concave densiometer held at the center of each plot canopy closure also increased from the general harvest area 15 to the buffer harvest edge 49 and into the riparian buffer 86 foliar and ground cover was estimated within each plot from 50 points along a 10 cm2 sampling grid using the line point intercept method bonham 2013 foliar cover classes included grasses forbs and shrubs ground cover classes included litter slash moss wood rocks and bare ground foliar cover was generally greater on the south east facing slope compared to the north facing slope it was 3 1 times greater in the general harvest area 2 2 times greater along the buffer harvest edge and 1 7 times greater in the riparian buffer table 1 we quantified litter depth o horizon by measuring the depth from the forest floor surface to the surface of the mineral soil a horizon at three points along the exposed soil face at the bottom edge of each plot we then averaged the three point measurements for each plot litter depths ranged from 2 to 9 cm but were similar between the general harvest area buffer harvest edge and in the riparian buffer mean upslope accumulated area above each of the 1 m2 plots was 63 3 14 0 m2 for the harvested plots 44 4 6 0 m2 for the buffer harvest edge plots 54 4 6 3 m2 for the buffer plots 2 3 rainfall simulations we conducted two rainfall simulations on each of the 15 plots once under dry antecedent moisture conditions and once under wet antecedent moisture conditions during august 2015 simulations consisted of one hour of high intensity rainfall i60 70 80 mm h 1 representative of a 100 year return period or longer storm event for the northern rocky mountain region the return period for the storm event was estimated using rainfall frequency analysis weibull formula with an annual maximum precipitation series from a centrally located precipitation gauge following the first dry conditions simulation the plot remained uncovered for 24 hr prior to performing the second wet conditions simulation the rainfall simulator design was adopted and modified from covert and jordan 2009 as a robust portable device well suited for remote steep terrain fig 3 the simulator consisted of a single wide angle spray nozzle 1 2hh 30wsq spraying systems co wheaton illinois mounted to the bottom of a small platform the platform was mounted on a tripod base that extended to 3 m height above the plot which was found to produce rainfall velocities that were representative of high intensity short duration convective storms that are common in the study region covert and jordan 2009 the water supply for simulations was drawn directly from the adjacent stream using a water pump honda wx 15 american honda power equipment division alpharetta ga positioned at the base of the riparian buffer to deliver water to the nozzle through 30 m of 3 8 cm diameter flat hose and 15 m of 1 6 cm diameter garden hose this design provided a continuous water supply to maintain the target rainfall intensity over the one hour simulation the pump intake was screened to minimize the potential for coarse debris to clog the system given that simulations occurred during baseflow conditions in august we assumed negligible fine sediment contribution from the stream water however we collected a composite water sample during simulations from two rain gauges model 6331 manual stratus rain gauge placed on opposite corners of the plot to confirm that fine sediment in the simulated precipitation was insignificant 2 4 runoff and sediment samples during each rainfall simulation we collected five surface shallow subsurface runoff samples from the bottom edge of the plot these runoff samples were a combination of near surface biomat flow sidle et al 2007 surface runoff and shallow subsurface flow upper 5 cm of soil water samples were collected in 500 ml polyurethane bottles from a trough which was connected to the hillslope with a 0 04 cm metal sheet inserted at the boundary between the organic layer and mineral soil horizon while a small amount of disturbance occurred directly at the interface with the metal insert installation was standardized across all plots to prevent introduction of bias into runoff results samples were collected at 12 minute intervals the amount of time required to fill each bottle varied thus a single bottle was used to capture runoff during each collection interval either until the bottle filled or the 12 min had elapsed we recorded the time of runoff initiation as time from the start of the simulation to the moment when runoff first exited the collection trough the collection trough was shielded from above during rainfall simulation with a clear plexiglas cover while the plots were bounded on three sides with a steel frame to ensure only runoff from within the plot contributed to the water sample sample volumes and total sediment concentrations were determined in the laboratory following field collection runoff samples were first passed through a 250 μm sieve to remove large particulates and then filtered using a vacuum pump and 0 7 μm glass microfiber filters whatman grade gf f prior to weighing the filters to determine the total mass of sediment we removed the organic fraction through loss on ignition by placing the filters in a muffle furnace at 450 c for three hours sediment concentrations were calculated as the mass mg of sediment per unit volume l of runoff collected sediment yields mg m 2 min 1 were calculated as the product of sediment concentration mg l 1 and plot discharge l min 1 divided by the plot area 1 m2 2 5 soil water content the baseline soil content conditions of the organic o and mineral soil horizons were determined directly preceding pre and following post each simulation to characterize antecedent and post rainfall soil moisture the volumetric water content of the o horizon θor was measured at two points adjacent to the exterior edge of the plot frame the o horizon sample was collected by removing a 5 cm2 area of the o horizon down to the mineral soil and averaging the depth at four points to obtain a known volume for each sample we re filled the void created when extracting the o horizon bulk density sample with representative organic matter to keep the forest floor cover as continuous as possible during the simulation water content of each sample was then determined in the laboratory by weighing the sample before and after oven drying at 40 c for 3 5 days the volumetric water content of the upper 0 6 cm of the mineral soil horizon θm was measured vertically at six points evenly distributed around the exterior edge of the plot frame with an impedance soil moisture probe ml3 thetaprobe delta t devices cambridge uk accuracy 1 the mineral soil surface was exposed for each reading by carefully displacing the o horizon for each reading we averaged three point measurements to account for high spatial variability in θm the o horizon was then replaced to cover the mineral soil during rainfall simulation as both the organic and mineral sampling procedures caused disturbance to the soil measurements were taken from unique slightly offset locations at each of the four sampling periods i e pre dry post dry pre wet post wet 2 6 statistical analysis we used one way analysis of variance anova to test for differences in means of runoff rates sediment concentrations sediment yields and soil water content assumptions of equal variance normality and independence in each of the data sets were evaluated sediment concentrations and yields exhibited skewed distributions and were log transformed for statistical tests while aspect was initially explored as a potential factor response variables were unrelated to aspect and all five transects were pooled to explore the effect of plot position i e general harvest area harvest riparian edge riparian buffer pseudoreplication in the study design was addressed by conducting independent tests for each of the time periods or soil moisture conditions i e pre post dry wet the five runoff samples collected during each simulation were repeated measures producing temporal autocorrelation in the repeated sampling data as a result statistical comparisons among sites used the aggregate mean runoff rate and geometric mean sediment concentration or yield back transformation of log values from each simulation post hoc comparisons between means of the general harvest area buffer harvest edge and riparian buffer were conducted using tukey hsd tests statistical significance was assessed at a threshold of α 0 05 all statistical

all other plot positions were weaker p 20 similarly all runoff ratios declined during the wet condition rainfall simulations relative to the dry condition simulations with no evidence for differences between any of the plot positions p 27 for all pairwise comparisons in contrast while the variation among plot positions was weaker the general pattern of time to surface shallow subsurface runoff initiation after the start of rainfall simulations under dry and wet conditions was opposite of that observed for runoff rate time of runoff initiation under the dry condition rainfall simulations was approximately the same in the riparian buffer plots 2 02 0 39 se mins and the harvest riparian edge plots 1 89 0 26 mins and only marginally longer in the harvest area plots 3 66 1 08 mins fig 5 all pairwise comparisons p 18 however during the wet condition rainfall simulations it took longer for surface shallow subsurface runoff to initiate and a weak pattern of time to runoff initiation was

concentrations and sediment yields were opposite of the runoff rates with the general harvest area harvest riparian edge riparian buffer fig 6 specifically the geometric mean and 95 confidence intervals back transformed for the sediment concentration was a 424 8 mg l 1 151 0 1195 3 mg l 1 in the general harvest area b 100 9 mg l 1 45 8 222 1 mg l 1 along the harvest riparian edge and c 26 9 mg l 1 12 2 59 1 mg l 1 in the riparian buffer statistically there was strong evidence for differences in sediment concentrations between the general harvest area and along the harvest riparian edge t 3 21 p 01 and between the harvest area and the riparian buffer t 6 17 p 001 there was moderate evidence for differences between the harvest riparian edge and the riparian buffer t 2 96 p 03 the

yields between any of the plot positions while the general pattern in sediment concentration among plot positions remained the same during the wet rainfall simulations as the dry rainfall simulations general harvest area harvest riparian edge riparian buffer fig 6 variation in sediment concentrations among plot positions was somewhat weaker than observed under dry rainfall simulations the geometric mean and 95 confidence intervals back transformed for the sediment concentration was a 285 7 mg l 1 67 9 1201 5 mg l 1 in the general harvest area b 79 6 mg l 1 36 5 173 5 mg l 1 along the harvest riparian edge and c 22 3 mg l 1 3 5 141 7 mg l 1 in the riparian buffer however while sediment concentrations differed most strongly between the general harvest area and the riparian buffer t 3 51 p 01 other pairwise comparisons were not significant p 20 as riparian edge sediment concentrations during wet rainfall simulations were intermediate between those of the other two plot positions the geometric mean and 95 confidence intervals back transformed for the sediment yields during the wet simulations was a 3 0 mg m 2 min 1 0 1 134 5 mg m 2 min 1 in the general harvest area b 2 3 mg m

yields between any of the plot positions 3 3 soil water content prior to the dry condition rainfall simulations mean volumetric water content of both the o horizon θor and the upper 0 6 cm of the mineral soil θm generally followed the pattern of general harvest area harvest riparian edge riparian buffer fig 7 a however variation in soil moisture among plot positions was weaker for θor than was evident for θm while differences in θor were observed between the harvest area and the riparian buffer t 2 55 p 04 there was no evidence of differences in θor among the other plot positions p 13 however we observed much stronger differences in θm between the harvest and the riparian buffer t 15 42 p 001 and between the harvest riparian edge and both the harvest area t 5 16 p 001 and the riparian buffer t 10 26 p 001 the soil water content of the o horizon θor increased from the dry condition simulation to the wet condition simulation by 11 3 in the harvest area 14 5 at the harvest riparian edge and 10 8 in the riparian buffer similarly the soil water content of the upper 6 cm of mineral soil θm increased 8 7 in the harvest area 5 1 at the harvest riparian edge and 10 6 in the riparian buffer thus prior to the wet condition rainfall simulations both the θor and the θm followed the pattern of general harvest area harvest riparian edge riparian buffer fig 7b however while no statistically meaningful variation in θor was evident among plot positions p 19 much stronger effects of plot position were observed in deeper layers for θm p 001 for all pairwise comparisons 4 discussion 4 1 runoff rates our study in a high elevation rocky mountain catchment demonstrated that surface and shallow subsurface runoff rates during high intensity rainfall events were greater in a riparian buffer relative to a recently harvested cutblock especially when soil conditions were dry this finding was counter to our expectation as mechanical soil disturbance during forest harvesting activities has previously been associated with decreased porosity infiltration capacity and hydraulic conductivity leading to intensified surface runoff birkinshaw et al 2011 huang et al 1996 malmer and grip 1990 however after forest harvesting in chile mohr et al 2013 also observed higher infiltration and lower runoff rates in the general harvest area which they partially attributed to the breakup of naturally occurring water repellency at the soil surface and prolonged ponding of water due to increased soil surface roughness in our study we observed many depressions in microtopography in the general harvest area plots from mechanistic disturbance which were not prevalent in the riparian buffer plots previous studies have illustrated that the presence of increased microtopographic variation can increase the proportion of precipitation infiltrating by 20 200 dunne et al 1991 thompson et al 2010 indeed in our study microtopography appeared to lead to greater ponding of water and infiltration in the plots in the harvest area compared to the riparian buffer however the effect of harvesting activity on surface microtopography was heterogeneous especially at the harvest riparian edge which contributed to high variability in runoff response observed between plots additionally we postulate that the greater runoff volumes fig 4 and shorter times to runoff initiation fig s2 during the dry condition simulations and within the riparian buffer were strongly governed by the presence absence of water repellency we observed hydrophobic conditions most frequently during the dry condition rainfall simulations in the riparian buffer and to a lesser extent at the harvest riparian edge specifically we observed water visibly flowing along the organic horizon surface above the mineral soil shortly after the start of each rainfall simulation we did not observe this phenomenon in the general harvest area this is consistent with the presence of resins waxes or aromatic oils associated with pine dominated forests and or organic matter which are most prevalent during hot dry conditions and are known to increase runoff generation at the surface brown et al 1999 doerr et al 2000 kim et al 2005 miyata et al 2007 these water repellent properties of the topsoil may have been broken up during forest harvesting or may have been reduced in the moister soils in harvested plots doerr et al 2000 thereby increasing infiltration rates and reducing surface or shallow subsurface runoff in the harvested plots mohr et al 2013 the differences in runoff rates between the harvest area and the riparian buffer may also be partially attributable to differences in soil water content prior to the dry condition rainfall simulations the volumetric water content in the upper horizons of the mineral soil was 2 9 times greater in the harvest area compared to the riparian buffer this finding is consistent with other studies which have documented increased soil water content after forest harvesting because of strongly reduced rainfall interception and transpiration losses ares et al 2005 bethlahmy 1962 rab 1996 including related research in our study catchments greenacre 2019 due to wetter soil conditions in the harvest area initiation of preferential flow through larger macropores likely occurred more rapidly enhancing vertical drainage and infiltration beven and germann 1982 indeed the greater infiltration we observed in the harvested area occurred despite much greater sediment entrainment in harvested plots supporting the notion that preferential macropore flow less susceptible to pore plugging was the likely pathway responsible for enhanced drainage in harvested plots in our study shallow runoff rates decreased in all plots in the wet condition rainfall simulations relative to the dry condition simulations this observation reinforces the idea of increased connection of pore networks as soil water content increases resulting in greater and more rapid vertical flow mcdonnell 1990 sidle et al 2000 tsuboyama et al 1994 while we established transects and plots across a gradient of harvested to riparian settings which had mostly similar environmental settings unfortunately there was a gradient of increasing slopes from harvested to riparian plots this occurred because the harvested areas were constrained to gentler slopes less than 45 which is typical for operations in high elevation mountainous catchments despite this difference in plots there was no clear reason to suspect slope had a major influence on infiltration or runoff from our small 1 m2 plots rather the well established effects of water repellency and soil moisture on small plot infiltration runoff were likely the more dominant factors mohr et al 2013 indeed others have also observed the importance of microtopography surface litter and soil conditions e g moisture content bulk density as dominant factors controlling infiltration and runoff at the small plot scale hartanto et al 2003 liu et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 moreover wu et al 2017 recently noted that the role of slope on infiltration remains uncertain and a controversial issue even at the hillslope scale with contrasting observations of increased runoff with increasing slope essig et al 2009 fox et al 1997 decreased runoff with increasing slope abrahams et al 1988 assouline and ben hur 2006 or no relationship between runoff and slope cerdà and garcia fayos 1997 grosh and jarrett 1994 4 2 sediment transfer in our study the geometric mean of the sediment concentrations in runoff from plots in the general harvest area was 15 8 times greater than in the riparian buffer and 4 2 times greater than at the harvest riparian edge thus it was apparent that forest harvesting activity increased sediment availability on hillslopes within the general harvest area as observed previously in other experiments croke et al 1999b while the percent exposed bare soil in our harvested plots was only moderately greater than in the harvest riparian edge or riparian area plots drag scarification decreased soil aggregation and increased soil surface roughness in the harvested plots such effects on soil properties would have increased hillslope sediment availability jordan et al 2010 within the limitations of the small 1 m2 erosion plots in this study the low runoff rates and high surface roughness in our general harvest area plots illustrated that the combination of greater particle detachment and initial sheet flow likely governed the greater sediment production from harvested plots however we also did not observe evidence of larger scale erosional features associated with broader concentrated surface flow or uniform sheet flow in the harvested areas known to entrain and redistribute sediment down hillslopes croke et al 2005 hairsine et al 2002 lakel et al 2010 neary et al 2009 rivenbark and jackson 2004 the low sediment concentrations in the riparian buffer plots may be attributable to surface runoff occurring at the duff litter layer above mineral soil the cover and surface roughness provided by the litter layer is often a dominant control on surface erosion in forested environments ghahramani and ishikawa 2013 powers 2002 stuart and edwards 2006 as such while there was a clear gradient in mean plot slope from riparian buffers riparian harvest edges harvested areas our results for sediment production showed the opposite pattern which supports the notion that the first order controls governing sediment production in this study were surface cover litter and soil exposure sediment concentrations decreased during the wet condition rainfall simulation in all of the plots in the general harvest area and along the harvest riparian edge we attribute this surprising result to the removal of the loose sediment supply during the initial dry condition rainfall simulation croke et al 1999b high surface roughness in the harvest area plots may also have contributed to moderately low sediment transport during the wet condition simulations bryan 2000 despite these observations we caution that scale effects from plots are typically more variable for erosion than runoff with sediment concentrations generally increasing with plot length along the hillslope bagarello and ferro 2017 given that most observations and model simulations indicate higher erosion rates during high intensity precipitation events praskievicz 2016 routschek et al 2014 it is critical to continue to improve our understanding of the drivers of erosional processes and sediment delivery to streams under these rare conditions at a range of spatial scales our study also provides mechanistic insights into functional roles of riparian buffers in the broader suite of best management practices bmps often employed in forest harvest operations many agencies describe one of the functions of riparian buffers as filter strips that serve to limit sediment transfer from harvested areas to receiving streams however considerable historic and contemporary research indicates forest soils typically have high infiltration capacities which rarely enable substantial surface runoff and sediment transfer into riparian reserves after harvesting litschert and macdonald 2009 indeed even under the extreme precipitation intensities employed in this study 100 yr return period i60 high surface roughness in the general harvest area promoted higher infiltration and both lower surface runoff and runoff ratios in the general harvest area which would make sediment penetration into or through riparian buffers highly unlikely in this setting 5 conclusions understanding the potential for surface or shallow subsurface runoff and erosion during infrequent high intensity precipitation is critical given the projections for greater occurrence of these events in the future due to climate change observation of these rare events is difficult however the data from our rainfall simulations indicate such events may produce moderate surface shallow subsurface runoff rates 17 6 105 4 mm h 1 in high elevation rocky mountain catchments forest harvesting activity appeared to result in higher infiltration rates and vertical preferential flow compared to the riparian buffer in contrast the surface shallow subsurface runoff rates were highest in the riparian buffer which was likely due to differences in hydrophobicity surface roughness and soil water content between the sites we also found differences in sediment concentrations the highest sediment concentrations were from the general harvest area plots surprisingly sediment concentrations decreased during the wet condition rainfall simulation relative to the dry condition rainfall simulations especially in the general harvest area this was likely due to exhaustion of a sediment supply reduced connectivity due to surface roughness and increased vertical preferential flow with increasing soil wetness overall while we observed moderately high variability in this plot scale study with only modest replication the spatial patterns in runoff generation both amount and timing of runoff initiation sediment production and their relationships with soil moisture were consistent and monotonic along the gradient from harvested areas through riparian buffers this highlights the need for additional research to further explore if similar patterns appear evident in other hydro climatic settings ultimately a better understanding of mechanisms that regulate efficacy of best management practices such as riparian buffers will contribute to continued improvements in practices for watershed protection credit authorship contribution statement kira c puntenney desmond conceptualization methodology formal analysis

5771,forest harvesting often decreases soil infiltration capacity leading to rapid and increased delivery of surface runoff shallow subsurface runoff and sediment to streams while the general harvest area is typically the largest area of disturbance relative to forest roads or skid trails less is known about the degree to which the general harvest areas act as sources or sinks for runoff and sediment transport this includes a need to improve understanding of the potential for runoff and sediment delivery from harvest areas through riparian buffers to streams during infrequent high intensity precipitation events which are predicted to increase due to climate change in this study we used rainfall simulations to investigate surface shallow subsurface runoff and sediment transport from plots during extreme precipitation events within a steep headwater catchment in the rocky mountains simulations consisted of one hour of high intensity rainfall i60 70 80 mm h 1 representative of an 100 year or greater storm event for the northern rocky mountain region our objectives were to compare runoff rates sediment concentrations and sediment yields between the general harvest area along the edge of the riparian buffer at the interface with the harvested area and within the riparian buffer surface shallow subsurface runoff rates were greatest in the riparian buffer relative to the harvest area especially when soil conditions were dry mechanical soil disturbance during forest harvesting appeared to result in higher infiltration rates and vertical preferential flow relative to the riparian buffer however sediment concentrations in runoff from plots in the general harvest area were 15 8 times greater than in the riparian buffer and 4 2 times greater than at the harvest riparian edge comparatively sediment yields in the general harvest area were 2 0 times greater than in the riparian buffer and 1 2 times greater than at the harvest riparian edge quantitative and qualitative evidence suggests differences in runoff and sediment between the harvest area harvest riparian edge and riparian buffer were due to site differences in hydrophobicity surface roughness soil water content and sediment supply while we observed moderately high variability with only modest replication the spatial patterns in the amount and timing of runoff sediment production and their relationships with soil moisture were consistent and monotonic along the gradient from harvested areas through riparian buffers this highlights the need for additional research to explore if similar

2016 the hydrologic effects of forest harvesting activities in particular have been the focus of scientific investigation for decades bosch and hewlett 1982 brown et al 2005 stednick 1996 the majority of research has focused on the most compacted surfaces roads and skid trails luce 2002 sheridan et al 2006 sosa perez and macdonald 2017 these highly compacted surfaces decrease the soil infiltration capacity leading to more rapid and increased delivery of surface runoff shallow subsurface runoff and sediment to the stream luce and black 1999 macdonald et al 2001 research has shown an increase of 2 to 100 times more runoff and sediment from roads and skid trails compared to undisturbed surfaces even during low intensity rain events croke et al 1999a luce and black 1999 moreover many studies have found that unpaved haul roads or skid trails in steep unstable terrain can increase the occurrence of mass movements by 25 to 350 times amaranthus et al 1985 gray and megahan 1981 wemple et al 2001 increasing the delivery of sediment to stream channels benda et al 2005 brardinoni et al 2003 however the general harvest area i e area of tree harvesting excluding primary skid trails and haul roads typically represents a much greater area of disturbance relative to forest roads or skid trails and harvesting activities also impact this area especially if ground based forest harvesting equipment is used ampoorter et al 2012 miller et al 1996 heavy machinery such as harvesters skidders and forwarders can compact soils increase bulk density and decrease air filled porosity infiltration capacity and hydraulic conductivity across the general harvest area mohr et al 2013 sidle et al 2006 these effects are spatially heterogeneous leading to uncertainties about the contribution of the harvest area to runoff and sediment croke et al 1999a croke et al 1999b for example in the first two years after forest harvesting oyarzun and pena 1995 observed 1 8 to 3 9 times greater runoff and 1 9 to 5 8 times greater sediment concentrations from harvested plots compared to undisturbed pinus radiata monterey pine forest plots in contrast hartanto et al 2003 observed 48 less runoff and 54 less soil loss from harvested plots compared to undisturbed plots in indonesian rainforest catchments thus the degree to which the general harvest areas act as sources or sinks for runoff and sediment transport remains unclear mohr et al 2013 wallbrink and croke 2002 historical research 1950s and 1960s on the effects of forest management illustrated that the general harvest area could act as a principal source of increased runoff and sediment brown and krygier 1971 fredriksen 1970 harris 1977 the results from these early studies led to legislation requiring retention of riparian vegetation around streams to protect the freshwater environment cristan et al 2016 recent studies suggest that current best management practices bmps including retention of a riparian buffer are mostly effective at reducing the potential for sediment from general harvest areas to reach streams and negatively impact water quality and aquatic habitat hatten et al 2018 litschert and macdonald 2009 however there are still instances where harvest units following contemporary forest harvesting practices can provide a source of sediment bywater reyes et al 2017 macdonald et al 2003 motha et al 2003 indicating a need to better understand processes and drivers of runoff and sediment production from general harvest areas into or through riparian buffers furthermore projections suggest climate change may lead to increased precipitation amounts and intensities in many regions easterling et al 2000 trenberth et al 2003 this may result in higher rainfall erosivity amplified

precipitation in part due to wetter soil conditions and higher water tables improved understanding of the processes linking runoff and sediment delivery to streams during infrequent high intensity precipitation events are needed to help frame the scope of these predictions in forested environments here we provide insights into the role of the general harvest area and riparian buffer as sources or sinks for runoff and sediment transport during high intensity precipitation events specifically in this study we investigated surface shallow subsurface runoff and sediment transport from plots during extreme precipitation events within a steep headwater catchment recently harvested in the rocky mountains our objectives were to evaluate and compare runoff rates sediment concentrations and sediment yields during high intensity precipitation events between the general harvest area along the edge of the riparian buffer at the interface with the harvested area and within the riparian buffer specifically we used rainfall simulations of high intensity short duration storm events to a quantify surface or shallow sub surface runoff rates b quantify sediment concentrations and yields and c determine the influence of antecedent soil moisture on both runoff and sediment production within the general harvest area along the riparian buffer edge and within the riparian buffer 2 methods

facing with basin elevation ranging from 1479 to 2627 m the average catchment slope is 45 while the average channel slope is 11 wagner et al 2014 forest vegetation in the study catchment is dominated by stands of lodgepole pine pinus contorta var latifolia trembling aspen populus tremuloides and douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii var glauca at lower elevations upper montane at mid elevations sub alpine the vegetation is characterized by engelmann spruce picea engelmanii and subalpine fir abies lasiocarpa while high elevations are alpine meadow vegetation transitioning to talus slopes and bare rock soils are well to imperfectly drained eutric or dystric brunisols inceptisols u s soil taxonomy with weak soil horizon development typical of higher elevation northern environments geology is

falls as snow between october and april 50 70 leading to peak streamflow as snowmelt in may june mahat and anderson 2013 star creek west a 458 ha sub basin of the star creek catchment was harvested as a variable retention clearcut between january march 2015 forest harvesting operations consisted of the removal of 62 ha of timber using ground based equipment where felled trees were skidded to landings for processing following harvesting the cutover areas were drag scarified dozer anchor chain and left for natural regeneration this harvest treatment represented contemporary forest management practices in the region and was being compared with two alternative harvesting treatments in the other two sub basins of the star creek catchment as part of the southern rockies watershed project study silins et al 2016 operable areas were restricted to slopes less than 45 a 30 m riparian buffer was retained around all mapped waterbodies 2 2 rainfall simulation plots we selected 15 plots for rainfall simulations along three transects on a north facing hillslope aspect 358 and along two transects on a southeast facing hillslope aspect 129 fig 1 each transect consisted of three plots that were spaced 20 m apart along the planar hillslopes each plot was one square meter which was bounded by a three sided steel frame that was inserted into the soil with the open side facing down the slope the plots were located either a within the general harvest area b along the edge of the riparian buffer at the interface with the harvested area or c within the riparian buffer we characterized each of the 15 plots based on soil texture fig 2 aspect local slope canopy closure foliar and ground cover and litter depth table 1 the soil particle distribution for the sand silt and clay fraction was determined in the laboratory using the hydrometer method gee and or 2002 soil texture for the fine fraction 2 mm of the upper 0 6 cm of mineral soil was similar along the north facing and southeast facing hillslopes ranging from silty loam to silty clay loam fig 2 soil samples contained poorly sorted rocks and gravel estimated to make up 2 20 of the sample volume local plot slopes generally increased from the general harvest area into the riparian buffer table 1 slopes ranged from 13 to 29 within the harvested area 26 42 at the riparian harvest boundary and 36 55 within the riparian buffer canopy closure which is a measure of the portion of the sky hemisphere obscured by the vegetative canopy was estimated using a spherical concave densiometer held at the center of each plot canopy closure also increased from the general harvest area 15 to the buffer harvest edge 49 and into the riparian buffer 86 foliar and ground cover was estimated within each plot from 50 points along a 10 cm2 sampling grid using the line point intercept method bonham 2013 foliar cover classes included grasses forbs and shrubs ground cover classes included litter slash moss wood rocks and bare ground foliar cover was generally greater on the south east facing slope compared to the north facing slope it was 3 1 times greater in the general harvest area 2 2 times greater along the buffer harvest edge and 1 7 times greater in the riparian buffer table 1 we quantified litter depth o horizon by measuring the depth from the forest floor surface to the surface of the mineral soil a horizon at three points along the exposed soil face at the bottom edge of each plot we then averaged the three point measurements for each plot litter depths ranged from 2 to 9 cm but were similar between the general harvest area buffer harvest edge and in the riparian buffer mean upslope accumulated area above each of the 1 m2 plots was 63 3 14 0 m2 for the harvested plots 44 4 6 0 m2 for the buffer harvest edge plots 54 4 6 3 m2 for the buffer plots 2 3 rainfall simulations we conducted two rainfall simulations on each of the 15 plots once under dry antecedent moisture conditions and once under wet antecedent moisture conditions during august 2015 simulations consisted of one hour of high intensity rainfall i60 70 80 mm h 1 representative of a 100 year return period or longer storm event for the northern rocky mountain region the return period for the storm event was estimated using rainfall frequency analysis weibull formula with an annual maximum precipitation series from a centrally located precipitation gauge following the first dry conditions simulation the plot remained uncovered for 24 hr prior to performing the second wet conditions simulation the rainfall simulator design was adopted and modified from covert and jordan 2009 as a robust portable device well suited for remote steep terrain fig 3 the simulator consisted of a single wide angle spray nozzle 1 2hh 30wsq spraying systems co wheaton illinois mounted to the bottom of a small platform the platform was mounted on a tripod base that extended to 3 m height above the plot which was found to produce rainfall velocities that were representative of high intensity short duration convective storms that are common in the study region covert and jordan 2009 the water supply for simulations was drawn directly from the adjacent stream using a water pump honda wx 15 american honda power equipment division alpharetta ga positioned at the base of the riparian buffer to deliver water to the nozzle through 30 m of 3 8 cm diameter flat hose and 15 m of 1 6 cm diameter garden hose this design provided a continuous water supply to maintain the target rainfall intensity over the one hour simulation the pump intake was screened to minimize the potential for coarse debris to clog the system given that simulations occurred during baseflow conditions in august we assumed negligible fine sediment contribution from the stream water however we collected a composite water sample during simulations from two rain gauges model 6331 manual stratus rain gauge placed on opposite corners of the plot to confirm that fine sediment in the simulated precipitation was insignificant 2 4 runoff and sediment samples during each rainfall simulation we collected five surface shallow subsurface runoff samples from the bottom edge of the plot these runoff samples were a combination of near surface biomat flow sidle et al 2007 surface runoff and shallow subsurface flow upper 5 cm of soil water samples were collected in 500 ml polyurethane bottles from a trough which was connected to the hillslope with a 0 04 cm metal sheet inserted at the boundary between the organic layer and mineral soil horizon while a small amount of disturbance occurred directly at the interface with the metal insert installation was standardized across all plots to prevent introduction of bias into runoff results samples were collected at 12 minute intervals the amount of time required to fill each bottle varied thus a single bottle was used to capture runoff during each collection interval either until the bottle filled or the 12 min had elapsed we recorded the time of runoff initiation as time from the start of the simulation to the moment when runoff first exited the collection trough the collection trough was shielded from above during rainfall simulation with a clear plexiglas cover while the plots were bounded on three sides with a steel frame to ensure only runoff from within the plot contributed to the water sample sample volumes and total sediment concentrations were determined in the laboratory following field collection runoff samples were first passed through a 250 μm sieve to remove large particulates and then filtered using a vacuum pump and 0 7 μm glass microfiber filters whatman grade gf f prior to weighing the filters to determine the total mass of sediment we removed the organic fraction through loss on ignition by placing the filters in a muffle furnace at 450 c for three hours sediment concentrations were calculated as the mass mg of sediment per unit volume l of runoff collected sediment yields mg m 2 min 1 were calculated as the product of sediment concentration mg l 1 and plot discharge l min 1 divided by the plot area 1 m2 2 5 soil water content the baseline soil content conditions of the organic o and mineral soil horizons were determined directly preceding pre and following post each simulation to characterize antecedent and post rainfall soil moisture the volumetric water content of the o horizon θor was measured at two points adjacent to the exterior edge of the plot frame the o horizon sample was collected by removing a 5 cm2 area of the o horizon down to the mineral soil and averaging the depth at four points to obtain a known volume for each sample we re filled the void created when extracting the o horizon bulk density sample with representative organic matter to keep the forest floor cover as continuous as possible during the simulation water content of each sample was then determined in the laboratory by weighing the sample before and after oven drying at 40 c for 3 5 days the volumetric water content of the upper 0 6 cm of the mineral soil horizon θm was measured vertically at six points evenly distributed around the exterior edge of the plot frame with an impedance soil moisture probe ml3 thetaprobe delta t devices cambridge uk accuracy 1 the mineral soil surface was exposed for each reading by carefully displacing the o horizon for each reading we averaged three point measurements to account for high spatial variability in θm the o horizon was then replaced to cover the mineral soil during rainfall simulation as both the organic and mineral sampling procedures caused disturbance to the soil measurements were taken from unique slightly offset locations at each of the four sampling periods i e pre dry post dry pre wet post wet 2 6 statistical analysis we used one way analysis of variance anova to test for differences in means of runoff rates sediment concentrations sediment yields and soil water content assumptions of equal variance normality and independence in each of the data sets were evaluated sediment concentrations and yields exhibited skewed distributions and were log transformed for statistical tests while aspect was initially explored as a potential factor response variables were unrelated to aspect and all five transects were pooled to explore the effect of plot position i e general harvest area harvest riparian edge riparian buffer pseudoreplication in the study design was addressed by conducting independent tests for each of the time periods or soil moisture conditions i e pre post dry wet the five runoff samples collected during each simulation were repeated measures producing temporal autocorrelation in the repeated sampling data as a result statistical comparisons among sites used the aggregate mean runoff rate and geometric mean sediment concentration or yield back transformation of log values from each simulation post hoc comparisons between means of the general harvest area buffer harvest edge and riparian buffer were conducted using tukey hsd tests statistical significance was assessed at a threshold of α 0 05 all statistical

approximately the same in the riparian buffer plots 2 02 0 39 se mins and the harvest riparian edge plots 1 89 0 26 mins and only marginally longer in the harvest area plots 3 66 1 08 mins fig 5 all pairwise comparisons p 18 however during the wet condition rainfall simulations it took longer for surface shallow subsurface runoff to initiate and a weak pattern of time to runoff initiation was

geometric mean and 95 confidence intervals back transformed for the sediment concentration was a 285 7 mg l 1 67 9 1201 5 mg l 1 in the general harvest area b 79 6 mg l 1 36 5 173 5 mg l 1 along the harvest riparian edge and c 22 3 mg l 1 3 5 141 7 mg l 1 in the riparian buffer however while sediment concentrations differed most strongly between the general harvest area and the riparian buffer t 3 51 p 01 other pairwise comparisons were not significant p 20 as riparian edge sediment concentrations during wet rainfall simulations were intermediate between those of the other two plot positions the geometric mean and 95 confidence intervals back transformed for the sediment yields during the wet simulations was a 3 0 mg m 2 min 1 0 1 134 5 mg m 2 min 1 in the general harvest area b 2 3 mg m

yields between any of the plot positions 3 3 soil water content prior to the dry condition rainfall simulations mean volumetric water content of both the o horizon θor and the upper 0 6 cm of the mineral soil θm generally followed the pattern of general harvest area harvest riparian edge riparian buffer fig 7 a however variation in soil moisture among plot positions was weaker for θor than was evident for θm while differences in θor were observed between the harvest area and the riparian buffer t 2 55 p 04 there was no evidence of differences in θor among the other plot positions p 13 however we observed much stronger differences in θm between the harvest and the riparian buffer t 15 42 p 001 and between the harvest riparian edge and both the harvest area t 5 16 p 001 and the riparian buffer t 10 26 p 001 the soil water content of the o horizon θor increased from the dry condition simulation to the wet condition simulation by 11 3 in the harvest area 14 5 at the harvest riparian edge and 10 8 in the riparian buffer similarly the soil water content of the upper 6 cm of mineral soil θm increased 8 7 in the harvest area 5 1 at the harvest riparian edge and 10 6 in the riparian buffer thus prior to the wet condition rainfall simulations both the θor and the θm followed the pattern of general harvest area harvest riparian edge riparian buffer fig 7b however while no statistically meaningful variation in θor was evident among plot positions p 19 much stronger effects of plot position were observed in deeper layers for θm p 001 for all pairwise comparisons 4 discussion 4 1 runoff rates our study in a high elevation rocky mountain catchment demonstrated that surface and shallow subsurface runoff rates during high intensity rainfall events were greater in a riparian buffer relative to a recently harvested cutblock especially when soil conditions were dry this finding was counter to our expectation as mechanical soil disturbance during forest harvesting activities has previously been associated with decreased porosity infiltration capacity and hydraulic conductivity leading to intensified surface runoff birkinshaw et al 2011 huang et al 1996 malmer and grip 1990 however after forest harvesting in chile mohr et al 2013 also observed higher infiltration and lower runoff rates in the general harvest area which they partially attributed to the breakup of naturally occurring water repellency at the soil surface and prolonged ponding of water due to increased soil surface roughness in our study we observed many depressions in microtopography in the general harvest area plots from mechanistic disturbance which were not prevalent in the riparian buffer plots previous studies have illustrated that the presence of increased microtopographic variation can increase the proportion of precipitation infiltrating by 20 200 dunne et al 1991 thompson et al 2010 indeed in our study microtopography appeared to lead to greater ponding of water and infiltration in the plots in the harvest area compared to the riparian buffer however the effect of harvesting activity on surface microtopography was heterogeneous especially at the harvest riparian edge which contributed to high variability in runoff response observed between plots additionally we postulate that the greater runoff volumes fig 4 and shorter times to runoff initiation fig s2 during the dry condition simulations and within the riparian buffer were strongly governed by the presence absence of water repellency we observed hydrophobic conditions most frequently during the dry condition rainfall simulations in the riparian buffer and to a lesser extent at the harvest riparian edge specifically we observed water visibly flowing along the organic horizon surface above the mineral soil shortly after the start of each rainfall simulation we did not observe this phenomenon in the general harvest area this is consistent with the presence of resins waxes or aromatic oils associated with pine dominated forests and or organic matter which are most prevalent during hot dry conditions and are known to increase runoff generation at the surface brown et al 1999 doerr et al 2000 kim et al 2005 miyata et al 2007 these water repellent properties of the topsoil may have been broken up during forest harvesting or may have been reduced in the moister soils in harvested plots doerr et al 2000 thereby increasing infiltration rates and reducing surface or shallow subsurface runoff in the harvested plots mohr et al 2013 the differences in runoff rates between the harvest area and the riparian buffer may also be partially attributable to differences in soil water content prior to the dry condition rainfall simulations the volumetric water content in the upper horizons of the mineral soil was 2 9 times greater in the harvest area compared to the riparian buffer this finding is consistent with other studies which have documented increased soil water content after forest harvesting because of strongly reduced rainfall interception and transpiration losses ares et al 2005 bethlahmy 1962 rab 1996 including related research in our study catchments greenacre 2019 due to wetter soil conditions in the harvest area initiation of preferential flow through larger macropores likely occurred more rapidly enhancing vertical drainage and infiltration beven and germann 1982 indeed the greater infiltration we observed in the harvested area occurred despite much greater sediment entrainment in harvested plots supporting the notion that preferential macropore flow less susceptible to pore plugging was the likely pathway responsible for enhanced drainage in harvested plots in our study shallow runoff rates decreased in all plots in the wet condition rainfall simulations relative to the dry condition simulations this observation reinforces the idea of increased connection of pore networks as soil water content increases resulting in greater and more rapid vertical flow mcdonnell 1990 sidle et al 2000 tsuboyama et al 1994 while we established transects and plots across a gradient of harvested to riparian settings which had mostly similar environmental settings unfortunately there was a gradient of increasing slopes from harvested to riparian plots this occurred because the harvested areas were constrained to gentler slopes less than 45 which is typical for operations in high elevation mountainous catchments despite this difference in plots there was no clear reason to suspect slope had a major influence on infiltration or runoff from our small 1 m2 plots rather the well established effects of water repellency and soil moisture on small plot infiltration runoff were likely the more dominant factors mohr et al 2013 indeed others have also observed the importance of microtopography surface litter and soil conditions e g moisture content bulk density as dominant factors controlling infiltration and runoff at the small plot scale hartanto et al 2003 liu et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 moreover wu et al 2017 recently noted that the role of slope on infiltration remains uncertain and a controversial issue even at the hillslope scale with contrasting observations of increased runoff with increasing slope essig et al 2009 fox et al 1997 decreased runoff with increasing slope abrahams et al 1988 assouline and ben hur 2006 or no relationship between runoff and slope cerdà and garcia fayos 1997 grosh and jarrett 1994 4 2 sediment transfer in our study the geometric mean of the sediment concentrations in runoff from plots in the general harvest area was 15 8 times greater than in the riparian buffer and 4 2 times greater than at the harvest riparian edge thus it was apparent that forest harvesting activity increased sediment availability on hillslopes within the general harvest area as observed previously in other experiments croke et al 1999b while the percent exposed bare soil in our harvested plots was only moderately greater than in the harvest riparian edge or riparian area plots drag scarification decreased soil aggregation and increased soil surface roughness in the harvested plots such effects on soil properties would have increased hillslope sediment availability jordan et al 2010 within the limitations of the small 1 m2 erosion plots in this study the low runoff rates and high surface roughness in our general harvest area plots illustrated that the combination of greater particle detachment and initial sheet flow likely governed the greater sediment production from harvested plots however we also did not observe evidence of larger scale erosional features associated with broader concentrated surface flow or uniform sheet flow in the harvested areas known to entrain and redistribute sediment down hillslopes croke et al 2005 hairsine et al 2002 lakel et al 2010 neary et al 2009 rivenbark and jackson 2004 the low sediment concentrations in the riparian buffer plots may be attributable to surface runoff occurring at the duff litter layer above mineral soil the cover and surface roughness provided by the litter layer is often a dominant control on surface erosion in forested environments ghahramani and ishikawa 2013 powers 2002 stuart and edwards 2006 as such while there was a clear gradient in mean plot slope from riparian buffers riparian harvest edges harvested areas our results for sediment production showed the opposite pattern which supports the notion that the first order controls governing sediment production in this study were surface cover litter and soil exposure sediment concentrations decreased during the wet condition rainfall simulation in all of the plots in the general harvest area and along the harvest riparian edge we attribute this surprising result to the removal of the loose sediment supply during the initial dry condition rainfall simulation croke et al 1999b high surface roughness in the harvest area plots may also have contributed to moderately low sediment transport during the wet condition simulations bryan 2000 despite these observations we caution that scale effects from plots are typically more variable for erosion than runoff with sediment concentrations generally increasing with plot length along the hillslope bagarello and ferro 2017 given that most observations and model simulations indicate higher erosion rates during high intensity precipitation events praskievicz 2016 routschek et al 2014 it is critical to continue to improve our understanding of the drivers of erosional processes and sediment delivery to streams under these rare conditions at a range of spatial scales our study also provides mechanistic insights into functional roles of riparian buffers in the broader suite of best management practices bmps often employed in forest harvest operations many agencies describe one of the functions of riparian buffers as filter strips that serve to limit sediment transfer from harvested areas to receiving streams however considerable historic and contemporary research indicates forest soils typically have high infiltration capacities which rarely enable substantial surface runoff and sediment transfer into riparian reserves after harvesting litschert and macdonald 2009 indeed even under the extreme precipitation intensities employed in this study 100 yr return period i60 high surface roughness in the general harvest area promoted higher infiltration and both lower surface runoff and runoff ratios in the general harvest area which would make sediment penetration into or through riparian buffers highly unlikely in this setting 5 conclusions understanding the potential for surface or shallow subsurface runoff and erosion during infrequent high intensity precipitation is critical given the projections for greater occurrence of these events in the future due to climate change observation of these rare events is difficult however the data from our rainfall simulations indicate such events may produce moderate surface shallow subsurface runoff rates 17 6 105 4 mm h 1 in high elevation rocky mountain catchments forest harvesting activity appeared to result in higher infiltration rates and vertical preferential flow compared to the riparian buffer in contrast the surface shallow subsurface runoff rates were highest in the riparian buffer which was likely due to differences in hydrophobicity surface roughness and soil water content between the sites we also found differences in sediment concentrations the highest sediment concentrations were from the general harvest area plots surprisingly sediment concentrations decreased during the wet condition rainfall simulation relative to the dry condition rainfall simulations especially in the general harvest area this was likely due to exhaustion of a sediment supply reduced connectivity due to surface roughness and increased vertical preferential flow with increasing soil wetness overall while we observed moderately high variability in this plot scale study with only modest replication the spatial patterns in runoff generation both amount and timing of runoff initiation sediment production and their relationships with soil moisture were consistent and monotonic along the gradient from harvested areas through riparian buffers this highlights the need for additional research to further explore if similar patterns appear evident in other hydro climatic settings ultimately a better understanding of mechanisms that regulate efficacy of best management practices such as riparian buffers will contribute to continued improvements in practices for watershed protection credit authorship contribution statement kira c puntenney desmond conceptualization methodology formal analysis

5772,this paper presents a new framework for quantitatively identifying characterizing and analyzing systematic hydrological cycles resulting from streamflow variability in a way that integrates water supply and water demand the hydrological cycles in question are measures of the most severe drought and pluvial events in a historical record of streamflow along with their respective durations the metrics developed here to quantify such episodes are based on an extended sequent peak algorithm that tracks the dynamic shifts in hydrological behavior of streamflow by accounting for water supply and demand with respect to streamflow in the interest of being able to analyze the largest possible scope of hydrological cycles and behavior we apply the quantitative methods developed in this paper to streamflow reconstructions in the upper missouri river basin umrb as a case study we find that the duration of dry periods increase conspicuously as a function of increasing demand levels the duration of pluvial events decrease as a function of increasing demand levels and that the general tendency is for streamflow gauges on or near the main stem of the river to have shorter dry spell durations and typically lower drought severity on the other hand being on or near the main stem tends to result in longer duration pluvial events though these pluvials are typically less severe than those off the main stem persistence and spatial variability of streamflow reconstructions were also analyzed to shed further light on the spatial patterns identified earlier and to see if this variability and persistence may have an influence on the behavior of the streamflow as quantified by the metrics defined in this paper finally it was found that there is a stochastic dependence between the length of a drought and the time to recovery from that drought and this dependence is used to create simple conditional probability curves to help water managers prepare for future extreme events keywords streamflow regimes droughts pluvial streamflow reconstructions extreme hydrological events 1 introduction ocean atmosphere interactions that lead to inter annual and decadal quasi periodic behavior manifest themselves as periodic runs of wet or dry years often translating to periods of surplus or inadequate regional water supplies jain and lall 2001 such epochal changes in regional water resources can have important implications for the natural ecosystem society and the economy of the region they can be incredibly costly in multiple ways depending on the extent of the severity and duration of these cycles for instance the average cost of droughts and floods in the usa have been estimated to be around 9 5 billion per event and 4 3 billion per event respectively ncei noaa 2019 drought events in north dakota south dakota and montana during march december of 2017 in the usa caused 2 5 billion in damage most of which hit the agricultural sector nidis u s drought portal 2018 these are simply tangible financial costs and do not account for certain latent or hidden costs to the environment and biodiversity for these reasons it is clear that the ability to objectively and quantitatively identify dry and wet periods of streamflow and characterize them in terms of their lengths and level of severity is crucial to water planning and management furthermore it is crucial that this type of analysis is done with streamflow records that reach sufficiently far back in history in order to get a more complete idea of the return period of major hydrological events low frequency events and patterns of streamflow variability that may repeat in the future multi century paleo reconstructed streamflow data allows for a robust identification of such persistent and recurrent structure that appears anomalous relative to the traditional stochastic models used with the limited historical series this latter statement makes the need for extended records of reconstructed streamflow clear this paper details quantitative methods for characterizing and defining drought and pluvial severity and duration and demonstrates the importance of applying this method of analysis to paleo reconstructed streamflow data in which streamflow records are extended hundreds of years into the past in order to have a more complete understanding of the effects of streamflow variability several studies have been conducted along the lines of determining spatio temporal trends and patterns in hydrological droughts and floods mauget 2003 developed a method for identifying and evaluating intra and multidecadal variation in annual streamflow precipitation and temperature over conus continental united states using mann whitney u statistics over running time windows of 6 30 year durations in particular this method was able to capture the spatio temporal patterns of high and low flow periods in the us and how it was connected with such patterns found in precipitation and temperature sanborn and bledsoe 2005 computed 84 streamflow metrics characterizing various flow regime attributes for 150 streams in colorado washington and oregon and used multiple regression models unique to each flow regime type to predict these metrics a major concern in this paper was the careful stratification of stream types before implementing the models du et al 2013 investigated the spatiotemporal variation of dry wet conditions and their annual seasonal trends in the hunan province in china using the standardized precipitation index or spi mckee et al 1993 at various time scales the authors of this work also explored the relationship between extreme spi and the occurrence of historical drought and flood events as a means of investigating the potential utility of spi as a drought flood monitor spi was essentially used as a proxy for dry wet conditions and spi trends for each of the four seasons were examined using the mann kendall statistical test bales and pope 2001 developed a set of procedures for identifying changes in selected streamflow characteristics in this study the goal of the authors was to identify if trends or changes in the streamflow characteristics of the waccamaw river were localized and whether they were the result of anthropogenic activity or consistent with regional variation the indicators used here were annual yield which is defined as the ratio of annual streamflow to precipitation and streamflow itself it must be noted that the above cited studies entirely emphasized the supply side of streamflow variability through quantitative analysis of either streamflow or precipitation data or both this is true of many other studies as well see for example khaliq et al 2008 rubio alvarez and mcphee 2010 saadat et al 2013 however the risks and vulnerabilities facing water systems also change with changing water demands as a result of changing population and urbanization and with shifts in the way society views other externalities such as environmental protection and energy production barnosky et al 2012 kumar 2015 vogel et al 2015 vörösmarty et al 2015 consequently the goal of this paper is to begin creating an objective systematic and quantitative approach to identifying changes in streamflow behavior integrated with demand where we classify such behavior somewhat broadly in terms of a dry or wet phase relative to the demand our approach puts a very strong emphasis on the demand side of streamflow variability while maintaining the importance of supply note that there exist studies that incorporate the role of water demand these indices include the water stress index falkenmark et al 1989 water resource vulnerability index raskin et al 1997 international water management institute iwmi indicator seckler et al 1998 critical ratio alcamo et al 1997 2003 the water poverty index sullivan 2002 and the multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index msrri mehran et al 2015 among others one important difference between these studies and the present study is that this paper does not attempt to describe another index for quantifying drought conditions or availability of water for consumptive use this paper creates an entire framework for quantifying and identifying regime shifts and regime behavior in streamflow and creating quantitative assessment tools for reservoir managers in preparing for dry and wet pluvial phases all of this leads to a new set of metrics along with their governing equations that are defined discussed and applied to streamflow reconstructions to demonstrate how effectively the metrics work in describing phases of streamflow variability and how crucial the incorporation of water demand really is with the use of data arises the existence of a case study to which we apply the novel techniques developed in this study in this case the streamflow reconstructions used are from our recent study ravindranath et al 2019 on streamflow reconstruction in the upper missouri river basin umrb hence the umrb is our case study in this paper the paper is organized as follows section 2 gives an introduction and thorough description of the concepts definitions and equations that give rise to the methods and analyses demonstrated in this paper section 3 gives an overview of the mechanics of the analysis carried out in this paper emphasizes the importance of demand in the analyses for water management and provides a segue from the theoretical definitions and concepts of section 2 to the applied analytical nature of sections 4 and 5 section 4 discusses the case study and the specific approach of applying the ideas discussed in section 2 to the data for the case study section 5 shows the results of our analysis and discusses them in detail finally section 6 summarizes the paper and ends the paper with some concluding thoughts 2 background cycles regimes and drought metrics we begin our investigation by introducing several key equations and concepts that will form the basis of our proposed framework the metrics defined here are designed to quantify the impacts of varying water supply and varying water demand on water availability in the present context we are primarily concerned with reservoir management systems and so we restrict our discussion of water supply to streamflow from river basins take an n year record of streamflow data as the water supply variable and an n year record of water demand as the demand variable we first calculate the annual deficit def t as the difference between demand and supply and the year by year accumulation of deficit in water availability cdi t 1a def t d t s t f o r t 1 2 n 1b cdi t max 0 def t cdi t 1 f o r t 1 w i t h cdi 1 m a x 0 def 1 in eqs 1a and 1b d t represents demand for water in year t s t represents water supply in year t and cdi t is the value of the cumulative deficit index in year t it is typical and sufficient to assume that demand is a static value d while supply alone varies this way one can derive the impact of supply variability relative to a chosen demand level the value of the cumulative deficit in a given year represents the amount of water deficit accumulated from the beginning up until the current point in time note that the use of the max maximum function in eq 1b disallows us from considering negative cumulative deficit values which is tantamount to a water surplus whenever the cumulative deficit value is non positive it is automatically zeroed out to indicate the absence of drought and accounted as excess or ex t 2a ex t min 0 def t cdi t 1 for t 1 w i t h ex 1 m i n 0 def 1 2b ce i t i 1 t e x i c d i i 0 0 c d i i 0 in eq 2a ex t is the value of the water surplus for year t the remaining quantities are exactly as they were defined in eqs 1a and 1b the use of the min minimum here ensures that we are now considering only the negative values of the previously defined cdi or surplus values whereas cdi only considered positive values or deficit values in eq 2b cei t is the water surplus analog to cdi t it accumulates the excess ex t over time but only for the years where there is recorded excess i e when cdi t is zero hence the cei t is a dynamic proxy of water excess as it accumulates over time and we have now defined an equally effective measure for excess water supplies and how this evolves over time recall that the water supply considered here is also only streamflow as a final note it should be pointed out that the algorithm used to calculate the cdi is based on the sequent peak method that is commonly used for sizing of reservoirs thomas and burden 1963 ripl 1887 whereas in the sequent peak algorithm the spills non positive cumulative deficit values are not considered we extend the algorithm to account for the water excess that spills out of the reservoir as cei t hence forming the basis for dynamically defining the drought phase cdi t and the pluvial phase cei t the concepts of cdi and cei essentially define and characterize the impacts of water demand on freshwater supplied by streamflow and this characterization quantifies the concept of regimes which refers to the alternating dry and pluvial phases of streamflow variability a dry regime which can be somewhat casually referred to as a drought period occurs whenever the cdi returns consistently strictly positive values for a stretch of time fig 1 provides a useful visual for understanding regimes the upper panel of fig 1 shows a synthetic streamflow time series as an example of water supply with a horizontal line cutting through this time series representing water demand the regimes are difficult to make out by simply staring at this graph given the high degree of variability it is not true that a drought has ended and a pluvial has begun simply because the supply begins to peak above the demand depending on the extent of dryness prior to the point at which supply exceeds demand a rise of supply above demand would have to occur often enough and with sufficient magnitude in order to overcome the earlier deficits of water supply whilst the dips in between must not accumulate enough to counterbalance the peaks hence the bottom panel shows the regime time series that results from combining cdi and cei calculations made from the supply demand plot in the upper panel into one comprehensive time series plot this time series is a transformation of the original streamflow record using the demand line and eqs 1 and 2 an example of a dry regime is seen in the bottom panel of fig 1 as the first portion of the yellow shaded box in the time series plot above which is written dry phase a pluvial regime is the opposite of a drought dry phase and is characterized by excessive water supplies and a cei that is strictly positive in value over a stretch of time for convenience we show it here using negative ordinates an example of a pluvial is seen in the second portion of the yellow shaded box in the bottom panel of fig 1 above which is written pluvial a dry regime is inevitably followed by a pluvial a dry and pluvial regime together constitutes a cycle and a shift from dry to pluvial is known as a regime shift for the sake of simplicity we consider a cycle to begin with a creeping drought and end with the conclusion of a pluvial phase hence a cycle begins and ends at 0 and exhibits both a dry and pluvial regime in between in that order based on the concepts outlined in the previous paragraph we will now define a few simple but useful regime identification metrics and provide some equations to quantify these definitions drought severity s in fig 1 bottom panel is the maximum value of the cdi time series and in fig 1 bottom panel is the largest peak in the entire time series we can think of this as the drought of record for the time series the drought duration d in fig 1 bottom panel is the amount of time that elapses from the beginning of the drought of record at 0 to the point at which severity s is achieved for this illustration the spill volume v in fig 1 bottom panel is the minimum value of the entire cdi cei regime time series and is represented by the largest trough of the cei time series since it is shown as negative ordinates it is essentially a measure of the severity of the pluvial regime this is akin to the flood of record the pluvial duration dp in fig 1 bottom panel is the amount of time that elapses from onset of the pluvial to the conclusion of the pluvial whereby cei 0 again the recovery which is depicted by r in the bottom panel of fig 1 in the first portion of the highlighted cycle drought portion is defined as the amount of time that is required to travel from the peak severity of the drought of record to the end of that dry regime in other words r is the de escalation time of the drought of record given these definitions we have the accompanying equations to quantify these concepts as one dry and one pluvial regime each occur consecutively in one cycle we must understand that over an n year record of time multiple cycles will occur depending on the magnitude of n and the length of the cycles 3 s max t cdi t 4 d t 1 t cdi t s t t t a where t is the point in time at which cdit s a is the set of all time indices t that correspond to the cycle during which the drought of record is observed and 1 t cdi t s t t t a 1 i f t t cdi t s t t t a 0 o t h e r w i s e 5 v max t cei t 6 dp t 1 t cei t 0 cdi t 0 t b where b is the set of all time indices t that correspond to the cycle during which the flood of record is observed 7 r t 1 t 0 cdi t s t t it has to be noted that although a dry regime is inevitably followed by a pluvial s and v do not have to be synchronous i e the flood of record does not have to occur after the drought of record we now proceed to the next section equipped with these concepts definitions and equations 3 a demand driven regime identification scheme in the previous section we completely defined the concepts of the cumulative deficit and excess indices cdi and cei respectively cycles hydrological regimes regime shifts drought duration drought severity recovery pluvial duration and spill volume for an n year record of flow we calculate the cdi and cei indices for the entire record and thus generate the regime cycle time series corresponding to the original streamflow record we can count the number of cycles from this time series and characterize the duration severity recovery and spill volume of each cycle using eqs 3 through 7 we now in turn have time series of dry regime and pluvial regime durations drought severity drought recovery and spill volume corresponding to the original flow record we can extrapolate these time series and hence forecast regime behavior for the future which can then be used to help guide water policy water planning management and infrastructure development for dams as future projects using a reasonable probability or statistical model it is desired to have a sufficiently long time series of regime cycle characteristics and in turn of streamflow data in order to make meaningful extrapolations this is where it is useful to use paleo reconstructed streamflow records for this type of analysis and analyze historical regime behavior first before extrapolating into the future with a now sizable dataset as discussed in the introduction typical analyses of drought and pluvial events rely on the supply side of the story that is to say that these analyses do not pay sufficient heed to the influence of water demand on water deficit and stress our cdi and cei metrics as demonstrated in eqs 1a 1b and 2a 2b are based on both supply and demand the demand side of water stress is crucial in determining the level of water stress and we now show that any measure of water stress that considers only supply is most likely an incomplete measure of stress depending on the specific context in which it is being applied 4 case study exploring historical regime behavior in the umrb we apply the techniques and concepts from the previous two sections to paleo reconstructed streamflow records in the upper missouri river basin umrb in order to study the historical regime behavior of the umrb and demonstrate how our approach works the missouri river basin mrb is the second largest drainage basin in the united states and drains roughly one sixth of the conterminous united states and roughly 25 100 km2 or 9 691 square miles of canada galat et al 2005 the watershed area of the mrb is over 500 000 square miles and the missouri river produces annual yields of 40 million acre feet united states department of the interior bureau of reclamation 2016 the basin is interesting due to its size importance and geographic topographic and climatic complexities for instance wise et al 2018 found that different seasonal controls affect the upper and lower portions of the basin and that streamflow and temperature trends were quite different between these two parts it is especially interesting to use the umrb as a case study and not just as a matter of an instructive use of streamflow reconstructions this is because since 1898 when record keeping of streamflow in the umrb officially began nine out of ten of the biggest flood events in the umrb occurred after 1970 livneh et al 2016 this indicates a greater tendency towards extreme pluvial events as it is possible that events such as these have occurred in the distant past beyond the temporal scope of our observed data we must extend the historical record in order to see this the spatial structure of the dams and reservoirs in the umrb and the mrb more generally is one of a network whereby the flows from one streamflow site eventually joins into another as a tributary in this way the flows from several individual sites join other sites at a junction which then flows to other sites culminating in a terminal site somewhere on the main stem that accumulates all of the flows accounted for starting from the most upstream headwaters of the river in the present situation we are considering a portion of the umrb that consists of eighteen streamflow sites see fig 2 top panel for a map of the portion of the umrb under consideration in this figure the red triangles are the streamflow sites and the green objects that non coincidentally resemble trees represent the local tree ring chronologies corresponding to those sites the trees provide paleo climatic information for the streamflow reconstructions via their observed tree rings from which tree ring chronology data is generated the record length of the observed data from each of these streamflow sites ranges from forty seven to seventy four years with an average record length of roughly sixty one years in order to get a better sense of the hydrological regime patterns in the umrb over its history we generate reconstructions for all eighteen stations simultaneously considering the network structure of the dams and river topography we use a novel bayesian network model as described in ravindranath et al 2019 in order to obtain the reconstructed flows from all eighteen stations given the network structure of the umrb the model places a multivariate lognormal joint likelihood function on the entire river network estimates its parameters in a bayesian regression setting using the tree ring chronologies and any inflows from other upstream sites as predictors and generates reconstructions from the river network s likelihood function as far back as the tree ring chronologies dictate using once again the tree ring chronologies and the median of the reconstructed tributary flows as covariates the reconstructions for each of the eighteen stations are generated as a sequence of distributions over the extended record of time rather than as a sequence of points fig 2 bottom panel shows an example of the reconstructions for one of the eighteen stations rather than generating a time series of single points the bayesian network model generates a time series of boxplots one boxplot for each year reconstructed from 1800 to 1989 the boxplot itself represents the posterior distribution of the reconstructed flow estimates the reconstruction model generates posterior streamflow distributions that are relatively low in distributional uncertainty and that on average follow the same trends as the observations while not being far from the observations in median value as seen when comparing the blue lowess loader 1999 curve with the red lowess curve over the instrumental period see fig 2 caption for necessary explanations for a given year the distributional streamflow reconstruction consists of 3 000 values simulated from the posterior distribution of the joint likelihood distribution function placed on the riverine network structure of these eighteen stations hence for the 190 reconstructed years we essentially have 3 000 time series strands or strings each string being a time series of 190 points each of these time series has a probability of being the true 190 year record that is assigned by the posterior distribution the main purpose of this work is to implement the concepts discussed in section 2 and eqs 1 through 7 on reconstructed flows in order to systematize a method for characterizing regime behavior over sufficiently long periods of time longer records of flow offer the advantage of being able to reveal a greater number of important patterns in the streamflow variability and in regime behavior in order to properly understand the role played by integrating water demand we experiment with our proposed framework at several different successive levels of demand we now briefly describe the methodology taken to carry out the analysis the reconstructions for each of the eighteen streamflow sites in the umrb created a streamflow record ranging over 1800 1989 on the water year temporal resolution that is one reconstructed datum per year each reconstructed datum is a distribution consisting of 3 000 simulated streamflow values under a normal probability distribution the reconstruction for a given year is therefore presented as a boxplot representing the distribution of 3 000 values a reconstruction therefore consists of 190 boxplots each boxplot depicting a probability distribution of 3 000 values to produce a boxplot time series as opposed to the standard point based time series fig 2 bottom panel shows the reconstructions for landusky given the 190 year record of streamflow that we now have we have 3 000 time series of 190 year long reconstructions for each site for each of the eighteen streamflow stations we take the following steps consider q t i to be the i th time series of paleo reconstructed streamflow indexed by year t i 1 3 000 and t 1 190 we assign this as our supply variable we then simulate values of a parameter α from the open interval 0 1 in increments of 0 05 this gives us a total of twenty three values of α we can then calculate twenty three levels of demand simply by computing d α q where q 1 n t q t is the average value of the observed streamflow time series for a given streamflow site and α is one of the twenty three fixed values simulated we refer to the multiplier α as the demand fraction it represents the fraction of the long term average streamflow value that is required by the water consumers for each fixed α i and t we use the designated supply and demand variables to calculate the cdi and cei time series and use these to compute the derived variables severity s duration d spill volume v pluvial duration dp and recovery r each of these derived quantities represents one number for each streamflow time series in this analysis we modify the calculation of severity and spill volume by normalizing them by a product of the demand level and duration more specifically we use s s d d instead of s and v v d d p instead of v hence s and v are the annualized measures of drought severity and pluvial volume relative to the annual demand s v greater than 1 indicates that the annualized drought severity pluvial volume exceeds annual water demand we also calculate the drought recovery to duration ratio r d in addition to the recovery metric r in order to get an idea of how long the recovery time from a drought is relative to the amount of time elapsed to reach the drought severity an r d ratio less than 1 is most desirable as that indicates a relatively quick recovery from a drought and therefore a relatively quick return to more normal conditions since we repeat the above procedure for all 3 000 simulated streamflow time series we wind up with a sequence of twenty three distributions for each of the six derived quantities s d v dp r and r d where each of these distributions consists of 3 000 calculated values of the statistic one for each of the 3 000 paleo reconstructed streamflow time series we repeat this procedure with only the observations and compare the results with those using the reconstructions to identify if the paleo reconstructed streamflow offers quasi periodic information beyond what exists in the instrumental record we also include an examination of the spatial distribution of the results on a map of the umrb to see how some of these hydrological quantifiers indicators change as we move along the river network both on and around the main stem of the river 5 results and discussion we now discuss the results of applying the regime behavior identification techniques described earlier to the streamflow reconstructions for the umrb generated by the network bayesian model from ravindranath et al 2019 as an example of the analysis let us take a look at the most downstream site in the 18 site umrb network landusky 5 1 application of regime quantifying metrics to streamflow data fig 3 shows the results of applying the procedure described in detail in section 4 to landusky the upper left panel of fig 3 shows the results for the duration of the drought of record prior to a demand fraction value of α 0 5 the boxplot distributions are collapsed at their median value of 0 this means that when the demand fraction is sufficiently low in this case anywhere from 0 to 55 of the average observed streamflow for landusky the drought of record duration is essentially nonexistent this is because there are no droughts that occur for such low water demands in other words while there is inter annual to decadal variability in the streamflow supply when integrated with a low demand the drought signal is practically non existent however this begins to change at the demand fraction value of α 0 6 at which point there is virtually no spread around the median value aside from a couple of outliers circles above the box but for which the median value is slightly positive this median value increases for the remainder of the plot with the most significant increases occurring between demand fraction values of 0 75 to 0 80 furthermore a significant spread around the median begins to be observed at the demand fraction value of α 0 8 hence as we increase the water demand to at least 60 of the observed average and beyond the average length of the drought of record increases demonstrating the important role that demand plays in determining the occurrence of droughts and dry regimes more generally the blue pseudo curve superimposed on the boxplot sequence of the upper left hand panel of fig 3 represents the time series of drought durations for the observed data we can clearly see that it follows an identical trend to the average values medians of those from the reconstructed records although higher in value in most cases the reason for this slight discrepancy in the duration of the droughts between paleo reconstructed and observed records is simply that fewer droughts dry regimes are observed in the far shorter 62 year observed record of flow for landusky it just so happens that the most severe drought seen in the reconstructions occurring at a point in time in the past beyond the temporal scope of the observed record had shorter duration than the most severe drought in the observational data and this is true at any and all demand fractions this is something that a longer record of flow can capture that the insufficient observed record cannot the upper right hand panel of fig 3 shows a sequence of boxplot distributions displaying the results of applying the normalized severity metric to the same data and within the same procedure described above the metric s identified as s2d ratio in the title of the boxplot in the upper right hand panel of fig 3 is the severity normalized first by the demand level and then divided by its duration giving a demand normalized severity to duration ratio normalizing severity by demand gives us the largest possible fraction of water demand that is lost to a dry regime in the entire record hence a value like 0 50 tells us that our water system is experiencing a drought that has depleted an amount of water equivalent to 50 of the water demand level this water demand may be an aggregate of water demanded by various sectors and stakeholders such as agricultural domestic industrial etc when this is divided by the duration of that drought of record the metric now measures the amount of water depletion expressed as a fraction of the water demand that occurs each year over the lifetime of the dry regime with the maximum severity values of this ratio only appear at the 0 6 demand fraction with the exception of some outlying values the maximum approximate amount of yearly water depletion according to the reconstructed flows never exceeds 20 of the water demanded which occurs as a maximum value of the boxplot at the 0 95 demand fraction it is clearly seen that between the 0 6 and 0 8 demand fraction values the amount of water depleted each year increases quite dramatically demonstrating that an increase in water demand tends to lead to an increase in the severity of the depletion at demand fraction α 0 8 the entire normalized severity to drought index distribution shifts down from its position at α 0 75 implying that at this demand level the duration of the drought of record has grown by a greater proportion than the severity hence there is an important shift that occurs at demand fraction 0 8 at which point the duration increases disproportionately more than the severity of the drought itself from that point on we see a similar trend of increasing water depletion as a result of larger demands from the demand level of 0 6 this step change happens for every 15 units increase in the demand level the superimposed normalized severity to duration ratio based on the observations follows a similar but somewhat different trend we see an increase over the demand fractions 0 6 0 65 and 0 70 but a dip at 0 75 and increases thereafter until 0 90 where the value again dips to a lower value at 0 95 it appears that the pattern here for landusky is that the observed severity to duration series increases for three consecutive demand fraction values 10 units dips and then goes back to increasing for the next three values dips etc for the ratio values calculated from the reconstructed flows the pattern clearly entails an increase for every consecutive four 15 units a dip and then a repeat of this cycle indefinitely for landusky the duration increases disproportionately every 10 units for the severity to duration ratio calculated from the observed streamflow record and increases every 15 units for the severity to duration ratio calculated from the reconstructed streamflow distributions a quick glance at the upper left plot of peak dry regime duration reveals this pattern to be true a more detailed study would be required to see if this patterns holds for streamflow gauges more generally the lower left hand plot in the four panel portion of fig 3 shows the boxplot for the peak pluvial duration intuitively the trends in this plot are exactly opposite to those seen in the peak dry regime duration plot that is as demand fraction increases the distribution and or duration of pluvial events drops drastically the pluvial duration calculated from the observed streamflow behaves somewhat inconsistently from how it behaved in the very first boxplot in fig 3 dry regime duration in this plot the observation based peak pluvial duration is persistently far lower than the minimum value of the boxplot distributions which represent the paleo based peak pluvial durations for lower demand level this trend is just replicating the fact that there is very little drought and all the years are pluvial relative to demand as seen through a shorter observed record or through a longer paleo record however for larger demand fractions it may be the case that we lack a sufficient amount of information from the shorter observed records and need the more robust and much longer reconstructed records to deliver a more reasonable estimate of the peak pluvial duration the normalized volume to duration ratio is shown in the fourth panel of fig 3 located to the bottom right of the four panel portion of the figure there is a consistent decreasing trend in the boxplots as the demand fraction increases in value at demand fraction values less than or equal to 0 5 the entire distribution of the normalized volume to duration ratio generated from the paleo reconstructions of landusky streamflow collapses to a median value of 1 0 meaning that an amount that is equivalent to 100 of the water demanded is spilled each year which in turn implies that the excess water in the reservoir beyond what is held in full capacity and therefore the water that is spilled is exactly equal to the water demand level in other words for lower demand fractions since there is no drought signal relative to the demand the system is always under excess the percentage of water demand that is spilled each year is less than 100 when the demand fraction increases to 0 55 and beyond it is interesting to see that the distributions of the normalized spill volume to pluvial duration ratio have very little variability around their median values and in some cases none at all the distributions are generated by and are therefore a function of the distributions that define the streamflow reconstructions for landusky which have a remarkably low level of distributional variability themselves the two panel plot at the bottom of fig 3 depicts the drought recovery time and recovery to duration ratio where the duration here refers to d the drought duration metric there is a very clear increasing trend in the recovery metric as the demand fraction increases hence as the level of water demand increases the recovery time also increases which makes sense as increased water withdrawals and demands will tend to prolong the effect of the drought the blue curve reflecting the calculation of the recovery metric using the observed streamflow data with the demand fraction values shows the same increasing trend as the recovery metric calculated from the reconstructions prior to a demand fraction value of 0 66 the distribution of the recovery metric for landusky is collapsed at its median value of 0 indicating that for sufficiently low demand values there is no drought signal and hence no recovery time required this is affirmed by the top left plot in fig 3 depicting the drought duration in which there are no dry periods for a demand fraction less than 0 6 the increase in the recovery metric for landusky as a function of the demand fraction is approximately exponential and much more clearly so than the growth rate for drought duration which is the complementary measure for the dry phase of the regime cycle we may conclude that recovery is more sensitive to changes in demand fraction than the length of the drought at least for landusky this is confirmed in the recovery to duration ratio plot in which four of the six boxes display median values greater than or equal to 1 this indicates that the amount of time to recover from the drought dominates the drought duration the drought durations exceeds the recovery period by a small amount for the demand fractions 0 81 and 0 86 for the landusky gauge for a fixed demand level which changes solely in accordance with demand fraction α we observe that there is generally very little variation around the medians across all six panels of fig 3 the reason for this becomes obvious when we examine fig 2 second panel the variability around the medians in the boxplots in the landusky streamflow reconstructions are quite small owing to the uncertainty reduction paradigm built into the reconstruction model ravindranath et al 2019 the variability around the boxplot medians in the reconstruction time series appears to be around 10 000 cfs on average for each of the 3 000 iterations of the cdi calculation the supply input for a fixed demand fraction is the same contributing zero variability to the distribution of the drought spill metric in question the only exceptions to this rule are the peak pluvial duration distribution at demand fraction 0 65 whose lower quartile is around eighty years and upper quartile is a little more than one hundred and fifty years and the recovery to duration ratio distributions at demand fraction values 0 76 and 0 81 for the exceptional peak pluvial duration distribution the median value is around 125 years this is most likely a critical demand fraction value where the transition from low demand characterized by long duration 200 year pluvial events non existent droughts and 100 spill rate to high demand takes place since there is a sudden and dramatic drop in the peak pluvial duration between the 0 6 demand fraction and 0 7 demand fraction values the pluvial duration distribution is stretched between these two extremes this transition results in extremely high and low values creating a large range of values and hence large variance in the distribution rather than repeating the analysis just done for all eighteen stations we summarize the results of all streamflow sites with fig 4 for drought duration severity to duration ratio pluvial duration and spill volume to pluvial duration ratio fig 4 shows for each of the four derived variables presented in fig 3 the median of the boxplot distributions over all of the demand fraction values for all eighteen of the streamflow sites this gives us an idea of the average trend in the evolution of each of these four metrics over the increasing demand levels for all eighteen of the streamflow sites simultaneously the first panel upper left of fig 4 shows the trends in the dry regime duration for all eighteen stations we notice that there are several clusters present there are only two streamflow sites for which the duration trends grow beyond a value of 100 years the first of these rises beyond a drought duration value of 150 years and begins its ascent approximately at a demand fraction value of 0 68 while the second barely rises above 100 years and begins its ascent approximately at a demand fraction value of 0 76 the second cluster are the two sites whose average trends rise just beyond a duration value of 50 years but never make it near 100 years and begin a noticeable ascent around 0 82 demand fraction value the third cluster has an average trend line that begins a very sharp ascent around 0 9 demand fraction value and never quite makes it to 50 years the remaining streamflow sites have duration trends that never achieve a sharp ascent at all throughout the figure for the given demand fraction values although a small increase in the trend begins to occur after 0 8 demand fraction value the obvious conclusion is that dry regime duration is an increasing function of demand fraction although this increasing function can vary from station to station or region to region the third panel lower left of fig 4 shows an analogous average trend chart for the peak pluvial duration variable here we can make out at least two clusters the first are streamflow sites for which the average pluvial duration trend starts out very high over 150 years for low demand fraction values and decreases rapidly as the demand fraction increases the second cluster consists of streamflow sites for which the average pluvial duration trend starts out with relatively low values less than 100 years and continues to decrease as the demand fraction increases though the decrease in duration for this second cluster is generally less rapid than those of the first cluster we observe greater persistence for high duration values for a couple of sites the second panel upper right of fig 4 shows the average trends of the demand normalized severity to duration ratio as a function of the demand fraction these trends appear as curves with peaks and dips though many of the curves have several peaks or modes there is an observable pattern among the curves the streamflow sites with severity to duration trend curves that occupy a higher position along the vertical axis tend to have their largest peaks at lower demand fraction values and as we progress with sites that have curves that are successively lower in value along the vertical axis their largest peaks tend to occur at larger demand fraction values to a certain extent this pattern is logically sound as lower demand levels with higher severity trends will tend to peak earlier when severity is so much larger than duration and demand fraction increases are not yet enough to impact duration significantly whereas higher demand levels at lower severity trends will tend to peak later when an increase in demand fraction forces the severity to increase proportionately more than the duration there may be a spatial signal here where the streamflow gauges are impacted differentially with respect to regime severity and duration depending on their distance from the river s main stem the fourth and final panel lower right of fig 4 shows the demand normalized spill volume to pluvial duration average trend curves again taken as the median values of the distributional forms calculated from the streamflow reconstructions for each of the eighteen stations this graph simply demonstrates that we have a uniform decreasing trend for all eighteen of the streamflow sites as the demand fraction increases however there is again a spatial discrepancy in that certain streamflow sites have consistently higher spill volumes than others 5 2 spatial attributes of regime behavior in watersheds in fig 4 we observed discrepancies in the regime behavior across the eighteen streamflow sites as quantified by two duration indices and two drought pluvial indices we also observed a clustering of similar trends in regime behavior among groups of sites and we now ask the question is there a spatial pattern in regime behavior across the eighteen sites in the umrb in order to answer this question we plot the same data represented in fig 4 onto a riverine map of the umrb the lengths of the drought or pluvial duration and the intensity of the dry or pluvial regimes are all represented by dots located at the streamflow sites geographical coordinates on the map of the river basin shaded in different colors whereby darker colors represent longer durations or more intense hydrological regimes the color scheme on the maps is determined by dividing the range or output values of the four derived variables as seen on the vertical axis in the panels of fig 4 into five categories based on their quantiles the main stem of the river is in blue with minor feeder streams in lighter blue fig 5 depicts these maps in four panels one panel for each of the four derived variables under consideration these maps also help us to determine which of the trend curves plotted in the four panels of fig 4 correspond to which streamflow site note that the maps in fig 5 are done only for a demand fraction value of 0 91 panel 1 upper left of fig 5 shows us that generally streamflow sites along the main stem of the river have a shorter drought of record as the yellow colors along or very near the blue curve of the missouri river are usually within the first two categories of 10 11 and 12 13 although a handful fall into the third category sites that are further away from the river are generally in the third fourth and fifth categories thus it can be concluded that the dry regime duration trend curves of panel 1 in fig 4 that tend towards larger values take place in sites that are not along the main stem of the river this makes sense as inter annual flow variability is relatively lower along the main stem than it is in the tributaries and hence the sites along the main stem should be much less prone to long droughts panel 2 upper right of fig 5 shows us that the annual severity for each year of the life of the drought of record as a fraction of the demand level which is α 0 91 either does not have a straightforward pattern as we found with panel 1 or there is more to consider let us consider panel 1 in conjunction with panel 2 when duration is low and it tends to be lower with the main stem gauges the severity to duration ratio increases unless an adjustment is made in the severity to compensate what we can conclude is that the lighter colors have a greater tendency to occur on the main stem despite generally lower durations this implies that the severity is also considerably lower along the main stem which makes sense as the main stem has lower variance due to flow aggregation hence droughts will tend to be less severe where we see a low normalized drought severity to duration number in panel 2 corresponding to a high drought duration in panel 1 of fig 5 this simply implies that the severity of the drought of record is low enough relative to the duration that there is a small amount of contribution that each year makes to the cumulative drought value panel 3 lower left of fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of the duration in years of the most severe pluvial event for the demand fraction value of α 0 91 as expected we see the inverse of panel 1 for the gauges where there were lighter colors in panel 1 we see that those gauges now have darker colors and vice versa conceptually this is to be expected as pluvials are the complementary events to droughts and mathematically cei is essentially the inverse of cdi see section 2 hence in locations where there are low duration floods there is a tendency to find higher duration droughts panel 4 lower right shows that the colors near and along the main stem are the opposite for those very same gauges in panel 2 in other words large severity to duration ratios imply low spill volume to pluvial duration ratios this is expected as high drought severity in one location would seem to imply a low spill volume in that same location this inverse relationship across most of the gauges between panels 2 and 4 is then maintained even after dividing the severity or spill volume by duration due to the inverse relationship between panels 1 and 3 interestingly enough we find that streamflow gauges on or very close to the main stem have longer pluvial durations but according to panel 4 of fig 5 also have less severe pluvial events the tendency for such sites is to experience extended pluvial events with low severity this makes sense as the main stem of the river has lower variance than its tributaries and hence the long pluvial events with lower severity this four panel map fig 5 nicely summarizes the spatial distribution of the different regime quantifying metrics across the gauges and this was necessary as a means of sorting out the ambiguity inherent in fig 4 where it was difficult to label each curve with the appropriate streamflow gauge designation when streamflow variability is greater or generally larger in magnitude there is a greater tendency towards extreme behavior such as droughts and floods pluvials fig 8 panel 1 top shows the distributions of the coefficient of variation standard deviation divided by mean for each of the eighteen gauges in the umrb for a given streamflow gauge this was calculated by taking each of the 3 000 strands in the posterior distribution of the reconstructed flows and calculating the coefficient of variation cv for each of those 3 000 time series this gives us distributions graphically represented as boxplots for the cv for each of the eighteen sites generally speaking the streamflow gauges closest to the main stem namely landusky loma fort benton toston three forks madison three forks jefferson vaughn mcallister and logan all have cv distributions that are quite low in value according to the top panel of fig 8 vaughn is the furthest of all of these gauges from the main stem and appears to have a cv distribution with the highest values among all of these this corresponds with the fact that sites closest to the main stem tend to have shorter drought durations and a less severe drought of record and less severe pluvial events as seen in fig 5 in addition the uncertainty levels in the distributions for these cv values are minimal the only exception to this is winifred which is close to the main stem as seen in fig 1 but has large cv values and a cv distribution with high uncertainty a final point is that nearly all of the aforementioned streamflow sites with low uncertainty in cv distributions and low cv values are sites for which the reconstructions made use of sites immediately upstream whose flow fed into the site being reconstructed i e feeder sites as discussed in ravindranath et al 2019 and briefly mentioned in section 4 hence a spatial aggregation of flows leads to a reduction in variability at least in the reconstruction finally persistence of dry or wet conditions is what chiefly contributes to drought and flood conditions for rivers fig 8 panel 2 bottom panel shows a distribution of the autocorrelation values for each of the eighteen streamflow sites under consideration in the umrb these distributions were generated in a similar way to the cv values in fig 8 panel 1 with a maximum lag value of 1 the autocorrelation values give us an idea of persistence of hydrological regime behavior the sites with the highest autocorrelation values and lowest uncertainties in their autocorrelation distributions are once again the sites closest to the main stem landusky loma fort benton toston vaughn three forks jefferson and three forks madison these are sites that are also fed by upstream gauges evidently the low degree of persistence and variance is one reason for lower duration and intensity of the hydrologic regimes 5 3 dependence relationship between recovery and duration metrics there is an important rationale behind defining the duration and recovery metrics separately instead of considering their sum to be the duration of the entire drought period this reflects the fact that the peak of the drought phase passing and the cumulative deficit drawing down is a symptom of water supply exceeding water demand at this point drought conditions end and recovery back to a neutral state begins hence it makes sense to consider the period from the beginning of the dry phase up until the point at which the severity s is achieved to be the drought duration and the remainder of the time in the dry phase to be the recovery r the importance in separating duration and recovery is demonstrated by examining the joint dependency distribution of the two metrics fig 6 shows for four different demand fraction values of 0 81 0 86 0 91 and 0 96 estimated bivariate distributions for the log transformed with respect to natural base drought duration against the log transformed recovery the bivariate densities are estimated from and fit to the scatterplot of the log transformed data and are generated based on the clustering and scattering of these data points using a bivariate kernel density estimator these plots were created using the kde2d function in the locfit package in r software these plots are only created for the landusky streamflow gauge as an illustration for demand fraction α 0 81 upper left plot of fig 6 nonzero probabilities exist roughly between 2 year and 12 year drought duration horizontal axis and 1 year and 7 year drought recovery vertical axis this is essentially the support of the bivariate distribution corresponding to this demand fraction the bivariate distributions are plotted as level curves with the innermost curve representing a mode of the distribution these modes obviously occur whenever there is a significant clustering of duration recovery data for demand fraction 0 81 the highest probability mass is placed on the roughly 5 year duration mark i e 1 6 log duration units and roughly 5 year recovery mark hence an approximately symmetric dry phase with a drought lasting 5 years and a recovery period lasting 5 years is most likely to occur when the demand fraction is 0 81 this makes sense as larger demand values tend to lead to longer drought durations but do longer drought durations necessarily tell us something about the time to recovery for demand fraction 0 81 for landusky it is not clear that it does the higher probabilities are always placed on longer drought durations that are multidecadal in length but these probability masses are spread across the lower and higher recovery values fairly evenly within the support of the distribution for a demand fraction of 0 86 the support of the bivariate distribution shrinks considerably when compared to the demand fraction of 0 81 and the range over the drought duration tends towards larger values than the previous demand level however we see a nearly uniform amount of probability mass placed on each of the values within the support of the bivariate distribution essentially the distribution has shifted to the right showing a preference for larger values of drought duration additionally the distribution has shifted up implying larger values of recovery for the next demand fraction of 0 91 the distribution has an even narrower support has shifted very slightly towards larger values of the drought duration and has shifted up noticeably towards higher values of recovery for the final demand fraction of 0 96 the distribution has again shifted towards larger values of drought duration and larger values of recovery however there is a greater spread across the drought duration values resulting in a wider support for this bivariate distribution when compared to the previous two hence the pattern appears to be that as the demand fraction grows there is a tendency for the joint distribution of the drought duration and recovery to slide to larger values of both metrics and both move in concordance with another though there is more lag in the drought duration finally fig 7 shows conditional probability distributions for the probability that the recovery is less than some threshold value given that the duration is larger than that threshold for a multitude of such threshold values from 0 to 40 years this choice of years corresponds to the cycle lengths of the most common large scale teleconnection climate patterns namely the interannual enso the decadal nao and pdo and the multidecadal amo whose cycles are typically around 30 40 years in length hence we are looking at the likelihood that recovery is swifter than the duration given information about the duration of the drought we generate such a distribution for the same four demand fraction values for landusky we see two primary features here 1 there is a rightward shift of the probability curves as the demand fraction increases and 2 the persistence observed in the left tail of the plot intensifies and gets longer as the demand fraction increases for the first point as the demand fraction increases the plausible threshold values for recovery must also increase as more water is being withdrawn from the river or reservoir leading to longer recovery times for instance at a demand fraction of 0 96 the likelihood of requiring fewer than 10 or 20 years to recover from a drought that is longer than 10 or 20 years respectively is highly unlikely as recovery would require more years at this demand fraction level this also addresses the observance of the second feature listed such conditional probabilities are a quick and easy way to aid water managers and planners in making decisions about how to act or how far ahead to plan for major droughts such plots can even serve as probability rule curves for decision makers in the water resources industry recall from the introduction to this paper that droughts are typically much more costly than floods in that context this type of information is vital 6 summary and conclusions this paper gave rise to a new way of characterizing quantifying and identifying hydrological regime behavior using novel original metrics that are jointly dependent on the supply side as well as demand side of streamflow activity additionally this paper discussed the importance of partitioning the dry phase of a regime cycle into two distinct sub phases of drought duration and recovery investigated their regime behavior and joint dependency and exploited this joint dependency to develop a concept of conditional probability plots that water managers can use to help plan and prepare for drought flood events which we identified as being societally costly and traumatic events in the introduction we developed seven metrics to quantitatively define a particular aspect of regime behavior that can then be used as an analytical tool on streamflow data preferably reconstructed streamflow data to understand the patterns of regime behavior in the given data record these metrics build on our ongoing efforts to advance our understanding quantification and prediction of hydrologic extremes and regimes particularly in creating a body of literature that looks at water demand as an integral part of the analysis kim et al 2018 ravindranath et al 2018 ravindranath et al 2016 ho et al 2016 etienne et al 2016 devineni et al 2015 chen et al 2014 devineni et al 2013 understanding the past relative to current and future demand is the only way to know the risks to the water systems and what to expect in the future making this a crucial element of water resources management the metrics introduced here allow us to 1 calculate all dry regime signals in given streamflow data relative to a chosen demand thus creating a new transformed time series of the original data that gives us all basic characteristics of these dry spells 2 calculate all pluvial signals in a similar way to the dry signals by essentially just defining an inverse to the first metric 3 calculate the magnitude of the worst drought on record from metric 1 4 calculate the magnitude of the most extreme pluvial event on record from metric 2 5 calculate the length duration in years of the most extreme drought phase 6 calculate the length duration in years of the most extreme pluvial 7 calculate the amount of time required to evolve from the beginning of the worst drought in the record to the peak or magnitude of that drought these metrics were applied to streamflow reconstructions of eighteen sites in the umrb ravindranath et al 2019 as both a demonstration of how this method works on reconstructed flows and what information it can give us and as an interesting case study the results of the methodology developed and employed in this paper can be useful to a next step in which we use the results about past hydrological behavior concerning drought and pluvial events to simulate ensembles of future streamflow scenarios that can then be used directly in a basin management process model these models are in turn used to develop water policies for now as well as the future this is a project that the authors of this paper are planning on tackling next the authors would also like to spend some time exploring the utility of the recovery metric and its relationship with the drought duration metric more thoroughly declaration of

5772,this paper presents a new framework for quantitatively identifying characterizing and analyzing systematic hydrological cycles resulting from streamflow variability in a way that integrates water supply and water demand the hydrological cycles in question are measures of the most severe drought and pluvial events in a historical record of streamflow along with their respective durations the metrics developed here to quantify such episodes are based on an extended sequent peak algorithm that tracks the dynamic shifts in hydrological behavior of streamflow by accounting for water supply and demand with respect to streamflow in the interest of being able to analyze the largest possible scope of hydrological cycles and behavior we apply the quantitative methods developed in this paper to streamflow reconstructions in the upper missouri river basin umrb as a case study we find that the duration of dry periods increase conspicuously as a function of increasing demand levels the duration of pluvial events decrease as a function of increasing demand levels and that the general tendency is for streamflow gauges on or near the main stem of the river to have shorter dry spell durations and typically lower drought severity on the other hand being on or near the main stem tends to result in longer duration pluvial events though these pluvials are typically less severe than those off the main stem persistence and spatial variability of streamflow reconstructions were also analyzed to shed further light on the spatial patterns identified earlier and to see if this variability and persistence may have an influence on the behavior of the streamflow as quantified by the metrics defined in this paper finally it was found that there is a stochastic dependence between the length of a drought and the time to recovery from that drought and this dependence is used to create simple conditional probability curves to help water managers prepare for future extreme events keywords streamflow regimes droughts pluvial streamflow reconstructions extreme hydrological events 1 introduction ocean atmosphere interactions that lead to inter annual and decadal quasi periodic behavior manifest themselves as periodic runs of wet or dry years often translating to periods of surplus or inadequate regional water supplies jain and lall 2001 such epochal changes in regional water resources can have important implications for the natural ecosystem society and the economy of the region they can be incredibly costly in multiple ways depending on the extent of the severity and duration of these cycles for instance the average cost of droughts and floods in the usa have been estimated to be around 9 5 billion per event and 4 3 billion per event respectively ncei noaa 2019 drought events in north dakota south dakota and montana during march december of 2017 in the usa caused 2 5 billion in damage most of which hit the agricultural sector nidis u s drought portal 2018 these are simply tangible financial costs and do not account for certain latent or hidden costs to the environment and biodiversity for these reasons it is clear that the ability to objectively and quantitatively identify dry and wet periods of streamflow and characterize them in terms of their lengths and level of severity is crucial to water planning and management furthermore it is crucial that this type of analysis is done with streamflow records that reach sufficiently far back in history in order to get a more complete idea of the return period of major hydrological events low frequency events and patterns of streamflow variability that may repeat in the future multi century paleo reconstructed streamflow data allows for a robust identification of such persistent and recurrent structure that appears anomalous relative to the traditional stochastic models used with the limited historical series this latter statement makes the need for extended records of reconstructed streamflow clear this paper details quantitative methods for characterizing and defining drought and pluvial severity and duration and demonstrates the importance of applying this method of analysis to paleo reconstructed streamflow data in which streamflow records are extended hundreds of years into the past in order to have a more complete understanding of the effects of streamflow variability several studies have been conducted along the lines of determining spatio temporal trends and patterns in hydrological droughts and floods mauget 2003 developed a method for identifying and evaluating intra and multidecadal variation in annual streamflow precipitation and temperature over conus continental united states using mann whitney u statistics over running time windows of 6 30 year durations in particular this method was able to capture the spatio temporal patterns of high and low flow periods in the us and how it was connected with such patterns found in precipitation and temperature sanborn and bledsoe 2005 computed 84 streamflow metrics characterizing various flow regime attributes for 150 streams in colorado washington and oregon and used multiple regression models unique to each flow regime type to predict these metrics a major concern in this paper was the careful stratification of stream types before implementing the models du et al 2013 investigated the spatiotemporal variation of dry wet conditions and their annual seasonal trends in the hunan province in china using the standardized precipitation index or spi mckee et al 1993 at various time scales the authors of this work also explored the relationship between extreme spi and the occurrence of historical drought and flood events as a means of investigating the potential utility of spi as a drought flood monitor spi was essentially used as a proxy for dry wet conditions and spi trends for each of the four seasons were examined using the mann kendall statistical test bales and pope 2001 developed a set of procedures for identifying changes in selected streamflow characteristics in this study the goal of the authors was to identify if trends or changes in the streamflow characteristics of the waccamaw river were localized and whether they were the result of anthropogenic activity or consistent with regional variation the indicators used here were annual yield which is defined as the ratio of annual streamflow to precipitation and streamflow itself it must be noted that the above cited studies entirely emphasized the supply side of streamflow variability through quantitative analysis of either streamflow or precipitation data or both this is true of many other studies as well see for example khaliq et al 2008 rubio alvarez and mcphee 2010 saadat et al 2013 however the risks and vulnerabilities facing water systems also change with changing water demands as a result of changing population and urbanization and with shifts in the way society views other externalities such as environmental protection and energy production barnosky et al 2012 kumar 2015 vogel et al 2015 vörösmarty et al 2015 consequently the goal of this paper is to begin creating an objective systematic and quantitative approach to identifying changes in streamflow behavior integrated with demand where we classify such behavior somewhat broadly in terms of a dry or wet phase relative to the demand our approach puts a very strong emphasis on the demand side of streamflow variability while maintaining the importance of supply note that there exist studies that incorporate the role of water demand these indices include the water stress index falkenmark et al 1989 water resource vulnerability index raskin et al 1997 international water management institute iwmi indicator seckler et al 1998 critical ratio alcamo et al 1997 2003 the water poverty index sullivan 2002 and the multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index msrri mehran et al 2015 among others one important difference between these studies and the present study is that this paper does not attempt to describe another index for quantifying drought conditions or availability of water for consumptive use this paper creates an entire framework for quantifying and identifying regime shifts and regime behavior in streamflow and creating quantitative assessment tools for reservoir managers in preparing for dry and wet pluvial phases all of this leads to a new set of metrics along with their governing equations that are defined discussed and applied to streamflow reconstructions to demonstrate how effectively the metrics work in describing phases of streamflow variability and how crucial the incorporation of water demand really is with the use of data arises the existence of a case study to which we apply the novel techniques developed in this study in this case the streamflow reconstructions used are from our recent study ravindranath et al 2019 on streamflow reconstruction in the upper missouri river basin umrb hence the umrb is our case study in this paper the paper is organized as follows section 2 gives an introduction and thorough description of the concepts definitions and equations that give rise to the methods and analyses demonstrated in this paper section 3 gives an overview of the mechanics of the analysis carried out in this paper emphasizes the importance of demand in the analyses for water management and provides a segue from the theoretical definitions and concepts of section 2 to the applied analytical nature of sections 4 and 5 section 4 discusses the case study and the specific approach of applying the ideas discussed in section 2 to the data for the case study section 5 shows the results of our analysis and discusses them in detail finally section 6 summarizes the paper and ends the paper with some concluding thoughts 2 background cycles regimes and drought metrics we begin our investigation by introducing several key equations and concepts that will form the basis of our proposed framework the metrics defined here are designed to quantify the impacts of varying water supply and varying water demand on water availability in the present context we are primarily concerned with reservoir management systems and so we restrict our discussion of water supply to streamflow from river basins take an n year record of streamflow data as the water supply variable and an n year record of water demand as the demand variable we first calculate the annual deficit def t as the difference between demand and supply and the year by year accumulation of deficit in water availability cdi t 1a def t d t s t f o r t 1 2 n 1b cdi t max 0 def t cdi t 1 f o r t 1 w i t h cdi 1 m a x 0 def 1 in eqs 1a and 1b d t represents demand for water in year t s t represents water supply in year t and cdi t is the value of the cumulative deficit index in year t it is typical and sufficient to assume that demand is a static value d while supply alone varies this way one can derive the impact of supply variability relative to a chosen demand level the value of the cumulative deficit in a given year represents the amount of water deficit accumulated from the beginning up until the current point in time note that the use of the max maximum function in eq 1b disallows us from considering negative cumulative deficit values which is tantamount to a water surplus whenever the cumulative deficit value is non positive it is automatically zeroed out to indicate the absence of drought and accounted as excess or ex t 2a ex t min 0 def t cdi t 1 for t 1 w i t h ex 1 m i n 0 def 1 2b ce i t i 1 t e x i c d i i 0 0 c d i i 0 in eq 2a ex t is the value of the water surplus for year t the remaining quantities are exactly as they were defined in eqs 1a and 1b the use of the min minimum here ensures that we are now considering only the negative values of the previously defined cdi or surplus values whereas cdi only considered positive values or deficit values in eq 2b cei t is the water surplus analog to cdi t it accumulates the excess ex t over time but only for the years where there is recorded excess i e when cdi t is zero hence the cei t is a dynamic proxy of water excess as it accumulates over time and we have now defined an equally effective measure for excess water supplies and how this evolves over time recall that the water supply considered here is also only streamflow as a final note it should be pointed out that the algorithm used to calculate the cdi is based on the sequent peak method that is commonly used for sizing of reservoirs thomas and burden 1963 ripl 1887 whereas in the sequent peak algorithm the spills non positive cumulative deficit values are not considered we extend the algorithm to account for the water excess that spills out of the reservoir as cei t hence forming the basis for dynamically defining the drought phase cdi t and the pluvial phase cei t the concepts of cdi and cei essentially define and characterize the impacts of water demand on freshwater supplied by streamflow and this characterization quantifies the concept of regimes which refers to the alternating dry and pluvial phases of streamflow variability a dry regime which can be somewhat casually referred to as a drought period occurs whenever the cdi returns consistently strictly positive values for a stretch of time fig 1 provides a useful visual for understanding regimes the upper panel of fig 1 shows a synthetic streamflow time series as an example of water supply with a horizontal line cutting through this time series representing water demand the regimes are difficult to make out by simply staring at this graph given the high degree of variability it is not true that a drought has ended and a pluvial has begun simply because the supply begins to peak above the demand depending on the extent of dryness prior to the point at which supply exceeds demand a rise of supply above demand would have to occur often enough and with sufficient magnitude in order to overcome the earlier deficits of water supply whilst the dips in between must not accumulate enough to counterbalance the peaks hence the bottom panel shows the regime time series that results from combining cdi and cei calculations made from the supply demand plot in the upper panel into one comprehensive time series plot this time series is a transformation of the original streamflow record using the demand line and eqs 1 and 2 an example of a dry regime is seen in the bottom panel of fig 1 as the first portion of the yellow shaded box in the time series plot above which is written dry phase a pluvial regime is the opposite of a drought dry phase and is characterized by excessive water supplies and a cei that is strictly positive in value over a stretch of time for convenience we show it here using negative ordinates an example of a pluvial is seen in the second portion of the yellow shaded box in the bottom panel of fig 1 above which is written pluvial a dry regime is inevitably followed by a pluvial a dry and pluvial regime together constitutes a cycle and a shift from dry to pluvial is known as a regime shift for the sake of simplicity we consider a cycle to begin with a creeping drought and end with the conclusion of a pluvial phase hence a cycle begins and ends at 0 and exhibits both a dry and pluvial regime in between in that order based on the concepts outlined in the previous paragraph we will now define a few simple but useful regime identification metrics and provide some equations to quantify these definitions drought severity s in fig 1 bottom panel is the maximum value of the cdi time series and in fig 1 bottom panel is the largest peak in the entire time series we can think of this as the drought of record for the time series the drought duration d in fig 1 bottom panel is the amount of time that elapses from the beginning of the drought of record at 0 to the point at which severity s is achieved for this illustration the spill volume v in fig 1 bottom panel is the minimum value of the entire cdi cei regime time series and is represented by the largest trough of the cei time series since it is shown as negative ordinates it is essentially a measure of the severity of the pluvial regime this is akin to the flood of record the pluvial duration dp in fig 1 bottom panel is the amount of time that elapses from onset of the pluvial to the conclusion of the pluvial whereby cei 0 again the recovery which is depicted by r in the bottom panel of fig 1 in the first portion of the highlighted cycle drought portion is defined as the amount of time that is required to travel from the peak severity of the drought of record to the end of that dry regime in other words r is the de escalation time of the drought of record given these definitions we have the accompanying equations to quantify these concepts as one dry and one pluvial regime each occur consecutively in one cycle we must understand that over an n year record of time multiple cycles will occur depending on the magnitude of n and the length of the cycles 3 s max t cdi t 4 d t 1 t cdi t s t t t a where t is the point in time at which cdit s a is the set of all time indices t that correspond to the cycle during which the drought of record is observed and 1 t cdi t s t t t a 1 i f t t cdi t s t t t a 0 o t h e r w i s e 5 v max t cei t 6 dp t 1 t cei t 0 cdi t 0 t b where b is the set of all time indices t that correspond to the cycle during which the flood of record is observed 7 r t 1 t 0 cdi t s t t it has to be noted that although a dry regime is inevitably followed by a pluvial s and v do not have to be synchronous i e the flood of record does not have to occur after the drought of record we now proceed to the next section equipped with these concepts definitions and equations 3 a demand driven regime identification scheme in the previous section we completely defined the concepts of the cumulative deficit and excess indices cdi and cei respectively cycles hydrological regimes regime shifts drought duration drought severity recovery pluvial duration and spill volume for an n year record of flow we calculate the cdi and cei indices for the entire record and thus generate the regime cycle time series corresponding to the original streamflow record we can count the number of cycles from this time series and characterize the duration severity recovery and spill volume of each cycle using eqs 3 through 7 we now in turn have time series of dry regime and pluvial regime durations drought severity drought recovery and spill volume corresponding to the original flow record we can extrapolate these time series and hence forecast regime behavior for the future which can then be used to help guide water policy water planning management and infrastructure development for dams as future projects using a reasonable probability or statistical model it is desired to have a sufficiently long time series of regime cycle characteristics and in turn of streamflow data in order to make meaningful extrapolations this is where it is useful to use paleo reconstructed streamflow records for this type of analysis and analyze historical regime behavior first before extrapolating into the future with a now sizable dataset as discussed in the introduction typical analyses of drought and pluvial events rely on the supply side of the story that is to say that these analyses do not pay sufficient heed to the influence of water demand on water deficit and stress our cdi and cei metrics as demonstrated in eqs 1a 1b and 2a 2b are based on both supply and demand the demand side of water stress is crucial in determining the level of water stress and we now show that any measure of water stress that considers only supply is most likely an incomplete measure of stress depending on the specific context in which it is being applied 4 case study exploring historical regime behavior in the umrb we apply the techniques and concepts from the previous two sections to paleo reconstructed streamflow records in the upper missouri river basin umrb in order to study the historical regime behavior of the umrb and demonstrate how our approach works the missouri river basin mrb is the second largest drainage basin in the united states and drains roughly one sixth of the conterminous united states and roughly 25 100 km2 or 9 691 square miles of canada galat et al 2005 the watershed area of the mrb is over 500 000 square miles and the missouri river produces annual yields of 40 million acre feet united states department of the interior bureau of reclamation 2016 the basin is interesting due to its size importance and geographic topographic and climatic complexities for instance wise et al 2018 found that different seasonal controls affect the upper and lower portions of the basin and that streamflow and temperature trends were quite different between these two parts it is especially interesting to use the umrb as a case study and not just as a matter of an instructive use of streamflow reconstructions this is because since 1898 when record keeping of streamflow in the umrb officially began nine out of ten of the biggest flood events in the umrb occurred after 1970 livneh et al 2016 this indicates a greater tendency towards extreme pluvial events as it is possible that events such as these have occurred in the distant past beyond the temporal scope of our observed data we must extend the historical record in order to see this the spatial structure of the dams and reservoirs in the umrb and the mrb more generally is one of a network whereby the flows from one streamflow site eventually joins into another as a tributary in this way the flows from several individual sites join other sites at a junction which then flows to other sites culminating in a terminal site somewhere on the main stem that accumulates all of the flows accounted for starting from the most upstream headwaters of the river in the present situation we are considering a portion of the umrb that consists of eighteen streamflow sites see fig 2 top panel for a map of the portion of the umrb under consideration in this figure the red triangles are the streamflow sites and the green objects that non coincidentally resemble trees represent the local tree ring chronologies corresponding to those sites the trees provide paleo climatic information for the streamflow reconstructions via their observed tree rings from which tree ring chronology data is generated the record length of the observed data from each of these streamflow sites ranges from forty seven to seventy four years with an average record length of roughly sixty one years in order to get a better sense of the hydrological regime patterns in the umrb over its history we generate reconstructions for all eighteen stations simultaneously considering the network structure of the dams and river topography we use a novel bayesian network model as described in ravindranath et al 2019 in order to obtain the reconstructed flows from all eighteen stations given the network structure of the umrb the model places a multivariate lognormal joint likelihood function on the entire river network estimates its parameters in a bayesian regression setting using the tree ring chronologies and any inflows from other upstream sites as predictors and generates reconstructions from the river network s likelihood function as far back as the tree ring chronologies dictate using once again the tree ring chronologies and the median of the reconstructed tributary flows as covariates the reconstructions for each of the eighteen stations are generated as a sequence of distributions over the extended record of time rather than as a sequence of points fig 2 bottom panel shows an example of the reconstructions for one of the eighteen stations rather than generating a time series of single points the bayesian network model generates a time series of boxplots one boxplot for each year reconstructed from 1800 to 1989 the boxplot itself represents the posterior distribution of the reconstructed flow estimates the reconstruction model generates posterior streamflow distributions that are relatively low in distributional uncertainty and that on average follow the same trends as the observations while not being far from the observations in median value as seen when comparing the blue lowess loader 1999 curve with the red lowess curve over the instrumental period see fig 2 caption for necessary explanations for a given year the distributional streamflow reconstruction consists of 3 000 values simulated from the posterior distribution of the joint likelihood distribution function placed on the riverine network structure of these eighteen stations hence for the 190 reconstructed years we essentially have 3 000 time series strands or strings each string being a time series of 190 points each of these time series has a probability of being the true 190 year record that is assigned by the posterior distribution the main purpose of this work is to implement the concepts discussed in section 2 and eqs 1 through 7 on reconstructed flows in order to systematize a method for characterizing regime behavior over sufficiently long periods of time longer records of flow offer the advantage of being able to reveal a greater number of important patterns in the streamflow variability and in regime behavior in order to properly understand the role played by integrating water demand we experiment with our proposed framework at several different successive levels of demand we now briefly describe the methodology taken to carry out the analysis the reconstructions for each of the eighteen streamflow sites in the umrb created a streamflow record ranging over 1800 1989 on the water year temporal resolution that is one reconstructed datum per year each reconstructed datum is a distribution consisting of 3 000 simulated streamflow values under a normal probability distribution the reconstruction for a given year is therefore presented as a boxplot representing the distribution of 3 000 values a reconstruction therefore consists of 190 boxplots each boxplot depicting a probability distribution of 3 000 values to produce a boxplot time series as opposed to the standard point based time series fig 2 bottom panel shows the reconstructions for landusky given the 190 year record of streamflow that we now have we have 3 000 time series of 190 year long reconstructions for each site for each of the eighteen streamflow stations we take the following steps consider q t i to be the i th time series of paleo reconstructed streamflow indexed by year t i 1 3 000 and t 1 190 we assign this as our supply variable we then simulate values of a parameter α from the open interval 0 1 in increments of 0 05 this gives us a total of twenty three values of α we can then calculate twenty three levels of demand simply by computing d α q where q 1 n t q t is the average value of the observed streamflow time series for a given streamflow site and α is one of the twenty three fixed values simulated we refer to the multiplier α as the demand fraction it represents the fraction of the long term average streamflow value that is required by the water consumers for each fixed α i and t we use the designated supply and demand variables to calculate the cdi and cei time series and use these to compute the derived variables severity s duration d spill volume v pluvial duration dp and recovery r each of these derived quantities represents one number for each streamflow time series in this analysis we modify the calculation of severity and spill volume by normalizing them by a product of the demand level and duration more specifically we use s s d d instead of s and v v d d p instead of v hence s and v are the annualized measures of drought severity and pluvial volume relative to the annual demand s v greater than 1 indicates that the annualized drought severity pluvial volume exceeds annual water demand we also calculate the drought recovery to duration ratio r d in addition to the recovery metric r in order to get an idea of how long the recovery time from a drought is relative to the amount of time elapsed to reach the drought severity an r d ratio less than 1 is most desirable as that indicates a relatively quick recovery from a drought and therefore a relatively quick return to more normal conditions since we repeat the above procedure for all 3 000 simulated streamflow time series we wind up with a sequence of twenty three distributions for each of the six derived quantities s d v dp r and r d where each of these distributions consists of 3 000 calculated values of the statistic one for each of the 3 000 paleo reconstructed streamflow time series we repeat this procedure with only the observations and compare the results with those using the reconstructions to identify if the paleo reconstructed streamflow offers quasi periodic information beyond what exists in the instrumental record we also include an examination of the spatial distribution of the results on a map of the umrb to see how some of these hydrological quantifiers indicators change as we move along the river network both on and around the main stem of the river 5 results and discussion we now discuss the results of applying the regime behavior identification techniques described earlier to the streamflow reconstructions for the umrb generated by the network bayesian model from ravindranath et al 2019 as an example of the analysis let us take a look at the most downstream site in the 18 site umrb network landusky 5 1 application of regime quantifying metrics to streamflow data fig 3 shows the results of applying the procedure described in detail in section 4 to landusky the upper left panel of fig 3 shows the results for the duration of the drought of record prior to a demand fraction value of α 0 5 the boxplot distributions are collapsed at their median value of 0 this means that when the demand fraction is sufficiently low in this case anywhere from 0 to 55 of the average observed streamflow for landusky the drought of record duration is essentially nonexistent this is because there are no droughts that occur for such low water demands in other words while there is inter annual to decadal variability in the streamflow supply when integrated with a low demand the drought signal is practically non existent however this begins to change at the demand fraction value of α 0 6 at which point there is virtually no spread around the median value aside from a couple of outliers circles above the box but for which the median value is slightly positive this median value increases for the remainder of the plot with the most significant increases occurring between demand fraction values of 0 75 to 0 80 furthermore a significant spread around the median begins to be observed at the demand fraction value of α 0 8 hence as we increase the water demand to at least 60 of the observed average and beyond the average length of the drought of record increases demonstrating the important role that demand plays in determining the occurrence of droughts and dry regimes more generally the blue pseudo curve superimposed on the boxplot sequence of the upper left hand panel of fig 3 represents the time series of drought durations for the observed data we can clearly see that it follows an identical trend to the average values medians of those from the reconstructed records although higher in value in most cases the reason for this slight discrepancy in the duration of the droughts between paleo reconstructed and observed records is simply that fewer droughts dry regimes are observed in the far shorter 62 year observed record of flow for landusky it just so happens that the most severe drought seen in the reconstructions occurring at a point in time in the past beyond the temporal scope of the observed record had shorter duration than the most severe drought in the observational data and this is true at any and all demand fractions this is something that a longer record of flow can capture that the insufficient observed record cannot the upper right hand panel of fig 3 shows a sequence of boxplot distributions displaying the results of applying the normalized severity metric to the same data and within the same procedure described above the metric s identified as s2d ratio in the title of the boxplot in the upper right hand panel of fig 3 is the severity normalized first by the demand level and then divided by its duration giving a demand normalized severity to duration ratio normalizing severity by demand gives us the largest possible fraction of water demand that is lost to a dry regime in the entire record hence a value like 0 50 tells us that our water system is experiencing a drought that has depleted an amount of water equivalent to 50 of the water demand level this water demand may be an aggregate of water demanded by various sectors and stakeholders such as agricultural domestic industrial etc when this is divided by the duration of that drought of record the metric now measures the amount of water depletion expressed as a fraction of the water demand that occurs each year over the lifetime of the dry regime with the maximum severity values of this ratio only appear at the 0 6 demand fraction with the exception of some outlying values the maximum approximate amount of yearly water depletion according to the reconstructed flows never exceeds 20 of the water demanded which occurs as a maximum value of the boxplot at the 0 95 demand fraction it is clearly seen that between the 0 6 and 0 8 demand fraction values the amount of water depleted each year increases quite dramatically demonstrating that an increase in water demand tends to lead to an increase in the severity of the depletion at demand fraction α 0 8 the entire normalized severity to drought index distribution shifts down from its position at α 0 75 implying that at this demand level the duration of the drought of record has grown by a greater proportion than the severity hence there is an important shift that occurs at demand fraction 0 8 at which point the duration increases disproportionately more than the severity of the drought itself from that point on we see a similar trend of increasing water depletion as a result of larger demands from the demand level of 0 6 this step change happens for every 15 units increase in the demand level the superimposed normalized severity to duration ratio based on the observations follows a similar but somewhat different trend we see an increase over the demand fractions 0 6 0 65 and 0 70 but a dip at 0 75 and increases thereafter until 0 90 where the value again dips to a lower value at 0 95 it appears that the pattern here for landusky is that the observed severity to duration series increases for three consecutive demand fraction values 10 units dips and then goes back to increasing for the next three values dips etc for the ratio values calculated from the reconstructed flows the pattern clearly entails an increase for every consecutive four 15 units a dip and then a repeat of this cycle indefinitely for landusky the duration increases disproportionately every 10 units for the severity to duration ratio calculated from the observed streamflow record and increases every 15 units for the severity to duration ratio calculated from the reconstructed streamflow distributions a quick glance at the upper left plot of peak dry regime duration reveals this pattern to be true a more detailed study would be required to see if this patterns holds for streamflow gauges more generally the lower left hand plot in the four panel portion of fig 3 shows the boxplot for the peak pluvial duration intuitively the trends in this plot are exactly opposite to those seen in the peak dry regime duration plot that is as demand fraction increases the distribution and or duration of pluvial events drops drastically the pluvial duration calculated from the observed streamflow behaves somewhat inconsistently from how it behaved in the very first boxplot in fig 3 dry regime duration in this plot the observation based peak pluvial duration is persistently far lower than the minimum value of the boxplot distributions which represent the paleo based peak pluvial durations for lower demand level this trend is just replicating the fact that there is very little drought and all the years are pluvial relative to demand as seen through a shorter observed record or through a longer paleo record however for larger demand fractions it may be the case that we lack a sufficient amount of information from the shorter observed records and need the more robust and much longer reconstructed records to deliver a more reasonable estimate of the peak pluvial duration the normalized volume to duration ratio is shown in the fourth panel of fig 3 located to the bottom right of the four panel portion of the figure there is a consistent decreasing trend in the boxplots as the demand fraction increases in value at demand fraction values less than or equal to 0 5 the entire distribution of the normalized volume to duration ratio generated from the paleo reconstructions of landusky streamflow collapses to a median value of 1 0 meaning that an amount that is equivalent to 100 of the water demanded is spilled each year which in turn implies that the excess water in the reservoir beyond what is held in full capacity and therefore the water that is spilled is exactly equal to the water demand level in other words for lower demand fractions since there is no drought signal relative to the demand the system is always under excess the percentage of water demand that is spilled each year is less than 100 when the demand fraction increases to 0 55 and beyond it is interesting to see that the distributions of the normalized spill volume to pluvial duration ratio have very little variability around their median values and in some cases none at all the distributions are generated by and are therefore a function of the distributions that define the streamflow reconstructions for landusky which have a remarkably low level of distributional variability themselves the two panel plot at the bottom of fig 3 depicts the drought recovery time and recovery to duration ratio where the duration here refers to d the drought duration metric there is a very clear increasing trend in the recovery metric as the demand fraction increases hence as the level of water demand increases the recovery time also increases which makes sense as increased water withdrawals and demands will tend to prolong the effect of the drought the blue curve reflecting the calculation of the recovery metric using the observed streamflow data with the demand fraction values shows the same increasing trend as the recovery metric calculated from the reconstructions prior to a demand fraction value of 0 66 the distribution of the recovery metric for landusky is collapsed at its median value of 0 indicating that for sufficiently low demand values there is no drought signal and hence no recovery time required this is affirmed by the top left plot in fig 3 depicting the drought duration in which there are no dry periods for a demand fraction less than 0 6 the increase in the recovery metric for landusky as a function of the demand fraction is approximately exponential and much more clearly so than the growth rate for drought duration which is the complementary measure for the dry phase of the regime cycle we may conclude that recovery is more sensitive to changes in demand fraction than the length of the drought at least for landusky this is confirmed in the recovery to duration ratio plot in which four of the six boxes display median values greater than or equal to 1 this indicates that the amount of time to recover from the drought dominates the drought duration the drought durations exceeds the recovery period by a small amount for the demand fractions 0 81 and 0 86 for the landusky gauge for a fixed demand level which changes solely in accordance with demand fraction α we observe that there is generally very little variation around the medians across all six panels of fig 3 the reason for this becomes obvious when we examine fig 2 second panel the variability around the medians in the boxplots in the landusky streamflow reconstructions are quite small owing to the uncertainty reduction paradigm built into the reconstruction model ravindranath et al 2019 the variability around the boxplot medians in the reconstruction time series appears to be around 10 000 cfs on average for each of the 3 000 iterations of the cdi calculation the supply input for a fixed demand fraction is the same contributing zero variability to the distribution of the drought spill metric in question the only exceptions to this rule are the peak pluvial duration distribution at demand fraction 0 65 whose lower quartile is around eighty years and upper quartile is a little more than one hundred and fifty years and the recovery to duration ratio distributions at demand fraction values 0 76 and 0 81 for the exceptional peak pluvial duration distribution the median value is around 125 years this is most likely a critical demand fraction value where the transition from low demand characterized by long duration 200 year pluvial events non existent droughts and 100 spill rate to high demand takes place since there is a sudden and dramatic drop in the peak pluvial duration between the 0 6 demand fraction and 0 7 demand fraction values the pluvial duration distribution is stretched between these two extremes this transition results in extremely high and low values creating a large range of values and hence large variance in the distribution rather than repeating the analysis just done for all eighteen stations we summarize the results of all streamflow sites with fig 4 for drought duration severity to duration ratio pluvial duration and spill volume to pluvial duration ratio fig 4 shows for each of the four derived variables presented in fig 3 the median of the boxplot distributions over all of the demand fraction values for all eighteen of the streamflow sites this gives us an idea of the average trend in the evolution of each of these four metrics over the increasing demand levels for all eighteen of the streamflow sites simultaneously the first panel upper left of fig 4 shows the trends in the dry regime duration for all eighteen stations we notice that there are several clusters present there are only two streamflow sites for which the duration trends grow beyond a value of 100 years the first of these rises beyond a drought duration value of 150 years and begins its ascent approximately at a demand fraction value of 0 68 while the second barely rises above 100 years and begins its ascent approximately at a demand fraction value of 0 76 the second cluster are the two sites whose average trends rise just beyond a duration value of 50 years but never make it near 100 years and begin a noticeable ascent around 0 82 demand fraction value the third cluster has an average trend line that begins a very sharp ascent around 0 9 demand fraction value and never quite makes it to 50 years the remaining streamflow sites have duration trends that never achieve a sharp ascent at all throughout the figure for the given demand fraction values although a small increase in the trend begins to occur after 0 8 demand fraction value the obvious conclusion is that dry regime duration is an increasing function of demand fraction although this increasing function can vary from station to station or region to region the third panel lower left of fig 4 shows an analogous average trend chart for the peak pluvial duration variable here we can make out at least two clusters the first are streamflow sites for which the average pluvial duration trend starts out very high over 150 years for low demand fraction values and decreases rapidly as the demand fraction increases the second cluster consists of streamflow sites for which the average pluvial duration trend starts out with relatively low values less than 100 years and continues to decrease as the demand fraction increases though the decrease in duration for this second cluster is generally less rapid than those of the first cluster we observe greater persistence for high duration values for a couple of sites the second panel upper right of fig 4 shows the average trends of the demand normalized severity to duration ratio as a function of the demand fraction these trends appear as curves with peaks and dips though many of the curves have several peaks or modes there is an observable pattern among the curves the streamflow sites with severity to duration trend curves that occupy a higher position along the vertical axis tend to have their largest peaks at lower demand fraction values and as we progress with sites that have curves that are successively lower in value along the vertical axis their largest peaks tend to occur at larger demand fraction values to a certain extent this pattern is logically sound as lower demand levels with higher severity trends will tend to peak earlier when severity is so much larger than duration and demand fraction increases are not yet enough to impact duration significantly whereas higher demand levels at lower severity trends will tend to peak later when an increase in demand fraction forces the severity to increase proportionately more than the duration there may be a spatial signal here where the streamflow gauges are impacted differentially with respect to regime severity and duration depending on their distance from the river s main stem the fourth and final panel lower right of fig 4 shows the demand normalized spill volume to pluvial duration average trend curves again taken as the median values of the distributional forms calculated from the streamflow reconstructions for each of the eighteen stations this graph simply demonstrates that we have a uniform decreasing trend for all eighteen of the streamflow sites as the demand fraction increases however there is again a spatial discrepancy in that certain streamflow sites have consistently higher spill volumes than others 5 2 spatial attributes of regime behavior in watersheds in fig 4 we observed discrepancies in the regime behavior across the eighteen streamflow sites as quantified by two duration indices and two drought pluvial indices we also observed a clustering of similar trends in regime behavior among groups of sites and we now ask the question is there a spatial pattern in regime behavior across the eighteen sites in the umrb in order to answer this question we plot the same data represented in fig 4 onto a riverine map of the umrb the lengths of the drought or pluvial duration and the intensity of the dry or pluvial regimes are all represented by dots located at the streamflow sites geographical coordinates on the map of the river basin shaded in different colors whereby darker colors represent longer durations or more intense hydrological regimes the color scheme on the maps is determined by dividing the range or output values of the four derived variables as seen on the vertical axis in the panels of fig 4 into five categories based on their quantiles the main stem of the river is in blue with minor feeder streams in lighter blue fig 5 depicts these maps in four panels one panel for each of the four derived variables under consideration these maps also help us to determine which of the trend curves plotted in the four panels of fig 4 correspond to which streamflow site note that the maps in fig 5 are done only for a demand fraction value of 0 91 panel 1 upper left of fig 5 shows us that generally streamflow sites along the main stem of the river have a shorter drought of record as the yellow colors along or very near the blue curve of the missouri river are usually within the first two categories of 10 11 and 12 13 although a handful fall into the third category sites that are further away from the river are generally in the third fourth and fifth categories thus it can be concluded that the dry regime duration trend curves of panel 1 in fig 4 that tend towards larger values take place in sites that are not along the main stem of the river this makes sense as inter annual flow variability is relatively lower along the main stem than it is in the tributaries and hence the sites along the main stem should be much less prone to long droughts panel 2 upper right of fig 5 shows us that the annual severity for each year of the life of the drought of record as a fraction of the demand level which is α 0 91 either does not have a straightforward pattern as we found with panel 1 or there is more to consider let us consider panel 1 in conjunction with panel 2 when duration is low and it tends to be lower with the main stem gauges the severity to duration ratio increases unless an adjustment is made in the severity to compensate what we can conclude is that the lighter colors have a greater tendency to occur on the main stem despite generally lower durations this implies that the severity is also considerably lower along the main stem which makes sense as the main stem has lower variance due to flow aggregation hence droughts will tend to be less severe where we see a low normalized drought severity to duration number in panel 2 corresponding to a high drought duration in panel 1 of fig 5 this simply implies that the severity of the drought of record is low enough relative to the duration that there is a small amount of contribution that each year makes to the cumulative drought value panel 3 lower left of fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of the duration in years of the most severe pluvial event for the demand fraction value of α 0 91 as expected we see the inverse of panel 1 for the gauges where there were lighter colors in panel 1 we see that those gauges now have darker colors and vice versa conceptually this is to be expected as pluvials are the complementary events to droughts and mathematically cei is essentially the inverse of cdi see section 2 hence in locations where there are low duration floods there is a tendency to find higher duration droughts panel 4 lower right shows that the colors near and along the main stem are the opposite for those very same gauges in panel 2 in other words large severity to duration ratios imply low spill volume to pluvial duration ratios this is expected as high drought severity in one location would seem to imply a low spill volume in that same location this inverse relationship across most of the gauges between panels 2 and 4 is then maintained even after dividing the severity or spill volume by duration due to the inverse relationship between panels 1 and 3 interestingly enough we find that streamflow gauges on or very close to the main stem have longer pluvial durations but according to panel 4 of fig 5 also have less severe pluvial events the tendency for such sites is to experience extended pluvial events with low severity this makes sense as the main stem of the river has lower variance than its tributaries and hence the long pluvial events with lower severity this four panel map fig 5 nicely summarizes the spatial distribution of the different regime quantifying metrics across the gauges and this was necessary as a means of sorting out the ambiguity inherent in fig 4 where it was difficult to label each curve with the appropriate streamflow gauge designation when streamflow variability is greater or generally larger in magnitude there is a greater tendency towards extreme behavior such as droughts and floods pluvials fig 8 panel 1 top shows the distributions of the coefficient of variation standard deviation divided by mean for each of the eighteen gauges in the umrb for a given streamflow gauge this was calculated by taking each of the 3 000 strands in the posterior distribution of the reconstructed flows and calculating the coefficient of variation cv for each of those 3 000 time series this gives us distributions graphically represented as boxplots for the cv for each of the eighteen sites generally speaking the streamflow gauges closest to the main stem namely landusky loma fort benton toston three forks madison three forks jefferson vaughn mcallister and logan all have cv distributions that are quite low in value according to the top panel of fig 8 vaughn is the furthest of all of these gauges from the main stem and appears to have a cv distribution with the highest values among all of these this corresponds with the fact that sites closest to the main stem tend to have shorter drought durations and a less severe drought of record and less severe pluvial events as seen in fig 5 in addition the uncertainty levels in the distributions for these cv values are minimal the only exception to this is winifred which is close to the main stem as seen in fig 1 but has large cv values and a cv distribution with high uncertainty a final point is that nearly all of the aforementioned streamflow sites with low uncertainty in cv distributions and low cv values are sites for which the reconstructions made use of sites immediately upstream whose flow fed into the site being reconstructed i e feeder sites as discussed in ravindranath et al 2019 and briefly mentioned in section 4 hence a spatial aggregation of flows leads to a reduction in variability at least in the reconstruction finally persistence of dry or wet conditions is what chiefly contributes to drought and flood conditions for rivers fig 8 panel 2 bottom panel shows a distribution of the autocorrelation values for each of the eighteen streamflow sites under consideration in the umrb these distributions were generated in a similar way to the cv values in fig 8 panel 1 with a maximum lag value of 1 the autocorrelation values give us an idea of persistence of hydrological regime behavior the sites with the highest autocorrelation values and lowest uncertainties in their autocorrelation distributions are once again the sites closest to the main stem landusky loma fort benton toston vaughn three forks jefferson and three forks madison these are sites that are also fed by upstream gauges evidently the low degree of persistence and variance is one reason for lower duration and intensity of the hydrologic regimes 5 3 dependence relationship between recovery and duration metrics there is an important rationale behind defining the duration and recovery metrics separately instead of considering their sum to be the duration of the entire drought period this reflects the fact that the peak of the drought phase passing and the cumulative deficit drawing down is a symptom of water supply exceeding water demand at this point drought conditions end and recovery back to a neutral state begins hence it makes sense to consider the period from the beginning of the dry phase up until the point at which the severity s is achieved to be the drought duration and the remainder of the time in the dry phase to be the recovery r the importance in separating duration and recovery is demonstrated by examining the joint dependency distribution of the two metrics fig 6 shows for four different demand fraction values of 0 81 0 86 0 91 and 0 96 estimated bivariate distributions for the log transformed with respect to natural base drought duration against the log transformed recovery the bivariate densities are estimated from and fit to the scatterplot of the log transformed data and are generated based on the clustering and scattering of these data points using a bivariate kernel density estimator these plots were created using the kde2d function in the locfit package in r software these plots are only created for the landusky streamflow gauge as an illustration for demand fraction α 0 81 upper left plot of fig 6 nonzero probabilities exist roughly between 2 year and 12 year drought duration horizontal axis and 1 year and 7 year drought recovery vertical axis this is essentially the support of the bivariate distribution corresponding to this demand fraction the bivariate distributions are plotted as level curves with the innermost curve representing a mode of the distribution these modes obviously occur whenever there is a significant clustering of duration recovery data for demand fraction 0 81 the highest probability mass is placed on the roughly 5 year duration mark i e 1 6 log duration units and roughly 5 year recovery mark hence an approximately symmetric dry phase with a drought lasting 5 years and a recovery period lasting 5 years is most likely to occur when the demand fraction is 0 81 this makes sense as larger demand values tend to lead to longer drought durations but do longer drought durations necessarily tell us something about the time to recovery for demand fraction 0 81 for landusky it is not clear that it does the higher probabilities are always placed on longer drought durations that are multidecadal in length but these probability masses are spread across the lower and higher recovery values fairly evenly within the support of the distribution for a demand fraction of 0 86 the support of the bivariate distribution shrinks considerably when compared to the demand fraction of 0 81 and the range over the drought duration tends towards larger values than the previous demand level however we see a nearly uniform amount of probability mass placed on each of the values within the support of the bivariate distribution essentially the distribution has shifted to the right showing a preference for larger values of drought duration additionally the distribution has shifted up implying larger values of recovery for the next demand fraction of 0 91 the distribution has an even narrower support has shifted very slightly towards larger values of the drought duration and has shifted up noticeably towards higher values of recovery for the final demand fraction of 0 96 the distribution has again shifted towards larger values of drought duration and larger values of recovery however there is a greater spread across the drought duration values resulting in a wider support for this bivariate distribution when compared to the previous two hence the pattern appears to be that as the demand fraction grows there is a tendency for the joint distribution of the drought duration and recovery to slide to larger values of both metrics and both move in concordance with another though there is more lag in the drought duration finally fig 7 shows conditional probability distributions for the probability that the recovery is less than some threshold value given that the duration is larger than that threshold for a multitude of such threshold values from 0 to 40 years this choice of years corresponds to the cycle lengths of the most common large scale teleconnection climate patterns namely the interannual enso the decadal nao and pdo and the multidecadal amo whose cycles are typically around 30 40 years in length hence we are looking at the likelihood that recovery is swifter than the duration given information about the duration of the drought we generate such a distribution for the same four demand fraction values for landusky we see two primary features here 1 there is a rightward shift of the probability curves as the demand fraction increases and 2 the persistence observed in the left tail of the plot intensifies and gets longer as the demand fraction increases for the first point as the demand fraction increases the plausible threshold values for recovery must also increase as more water is being withdrawn from the river or reservoir leading to longer recovery times for instance at a demand fraction of 0 96 the likelihood of requiring fewer than 10 or 20 years to recover from a drought that is longer than 10 or 20 years respectively is highly unlikely as recovery would require more years at this demand fraction level this also addresses the observance of the second feature listed such conditional probabilities are a quick and easy way to aid water managers and planners in making decisions about how to act or how far ahead to plan for major droughts such plots can even serve as probability rule curves for decision makers in the water resources industry recall from the introduction to this paper that droughts are typically much more costly than floods in that context this type of information is vital 6 summary and conclusions this paper gave rise to a new way of characterizing quantifying and identifying hydrological regime behavior using novel original metrics that are jointly dependent on the supply side as well as demand side of streamflow activity additionally this paper discussed the importance of partitioning the dry phase of a regime cycle into two distinct sub phases of drought duration and recovery investigated their regime behavior and joint dependency and exploited this joint dependency to develop a concept of conditional probability plots that water managers can use to help plan and prepare for drought flood events which we identified as being societally costly and traumatic events in the introduction we developed seven metrics to quantitatively define a particular aspect of regime behavior that can then be used as an analytical tool on streamflow data preferably reconstructed streamflow data to understand the patterns of regime behavior in the given data record these metrics build on our ongoing efforts to advance our understanding quantification and prediction of hydrologic extremes and regimes particularly in creating a body of literature that looks at water demand as an integral part of the analysis kim et al 2018 ravindranath et al 2018 ravindranath et al 2016 ho et al 2016 etienne et al 2016 devineni et al 2015 chen et al 2014 devineni et al 2013 understanding the past relative to current and future demand is the only way to know the risks to the water systems and what to expect in the future making this a crucial element of water resources management the metrics introduced here allow us to 1 calculate all dry regime signals in given streamflow data relative to a chosen demand thus creating a new transformed time series of the original data that gives us all basic characteristics of these dry spells 2 calculate all pluvial signals in a similar way to the dry signals by essentially just defining an inverse to the first metric 3 calculate the magnitude of the worst drought on record from metric 1 4 calculate the magnitude of the most extreme pluvial event on record from metric 2 5 calculate the length duration in years of the most extreme drought phase 6 calculate the length duration in years of the most extreme pluvial 7 calculate the amount of time required to evolve from the beginning of the worst drought in the record to the peak or magnitude of that drought these metrics were applied to streamflow reconstructions of eighteen sites in the umrb ravindranath et al 2019 as both a demonstration of how this method works on reconstructed flows and what information it can give us and as an interesting case study the results of the methodology developed and employed in this paper can be useful to a next step in which we use the results about past hydrological behavior concerning drought and pluvial events to simulate ensembles of future streamflow scenarios that can then be used directly in a basin management process model these models are in turn used to develop water policies for now as well as the future this is a project that the authors of this paper are planning on tackling next the authors would also like to spend some time exploring the utility of the recovery metric and its relationship with the drought duration metric more thoroughly declaration of

5773,monitoring changes in flood extent is critical for flood control and mitigation purposes in areas where flooding affects many people and dense infrastructure and properties remote sensing can be an effective technique to detect changes in surface water extent and its dynamics compared to optical remote sensing microwave information is suitable for working in any weather condition without severe cloud interference usually passive microwave data has a high temporal but a rather coarse spatial resolution whereas for active microwave data this is reversed and only with ideal satellite constellation observations it can reach high sampling rates to overcome these spatial and temporal restrictions we proposed an integrated methodology to combine the passive and active microwave remote sensing and thus provide flood information more frequently at a high resolution in this paper a demonstration of the methodology is presented for a flood event occurring in wuhan hubei province of china in july 2016 the major inundation occurred along the jushui river part of the middle yangtze river basin using the brightness temperature data from a special data set measures a daily passive microwave signal at the resolution of 3 125 km is used as an indicator to monitor flood occurrence and obtain the flood duration over time synthetic aperture radar sar imagery 12 day revisit 10 m spatial resolution from sentinel 1 was processed to estimate high resolution flood extents within the time span of the flood based on a threshold based method together with the high above nearest drainage hand index post processor surface water fraction data generated from sar images presents a strong correlation with the passive microwave signal r2 0 84 when using a quadratic polynomial fit the average bias between surface water fraction computed by the passive microwave signals and sar observations for water pixels within the jushui river basin for the validation dates is 0 34 indicating that this relationship can be applied to interpolate surface water fraction for each pixel along the river and other permanent water bodies for days when sar observations are not available this integrated method takes advantage of both passive and active microwave remote sensing and enriches temporally sparse flood data given the global coverage of the datasets used in this study it can be utilized to estimate flood status for other flood prone areas and thus contribute towards societal flood preparedness and response keywords flood monitoring microwave remote sensing measures cetb sentinel 1 sar 1 introduction 1 1 background monitoring flood inundation extent is critical as flooding is one of the most destructive and devastating natural disasters and is responsible yearly for thousands of fatalities many more displacements and loss of properties and infrastructure hirabayashi et al 2013 jonkman 2005 timely mapping to determine impacted regions over the course of a flood event can be fundamental in providing timely decision support data to emergency responders especially for warning or supporting evacuations in urban areas klemas 2015 additionally a long time record of inundation maps provides important information for many other applications including flood hazard assessment public health management biodiversity conservation water use and urban planning eppink et al 2004 gessner 2014 moel et al 2009 viala 2008 however flood extent is highly dynamic and the terrain of flood prone areas is often complex requiring high resolution data which makes flood extent estimation a challenge brivio et al 2002 current flood monitoring methods can be divided into two main categories hydrological hydraulic modelling and satellite observation bates 2004 bates et al 1997 khan et al 2011 flood monitoring based on hydrological hydraulic models can provide real time guidance for flood control and mitigation if the model is well calibrated and running operationally using high resolution data however information on model inputs such as observed discharge and accurate river morphology are often inadequate for many areas which restricts the applicability of the modelling method gleason et al 2014 pechlivanidis et al 2011 weather data over a large region e g the meteorological forcing inputs provided by coarse resolution satellite estimates or point scale ground observations can also limit the accuracy of hydrological hydraulic modelling tang et al 2018 with rapid development of remote sensing techniques a number of earth observation satellites are monitoring some of the ongoing processes on the earth s surface at multiple spatial and temporal scales providing an alternative way to estimate flood dynamics over time studies have shown that surface water distribution across the globe can be estimated using moderate resolution imagery such as obtained by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis 250 m twice a day brakenridge and anderson 2006 carroll et al 2009 and landsat 30 m once every 8 days frazier and page 2000 pekel et al 2016 however water bodies mapping based on these optical remote sensing images can be complicated even in good weather conditions for example influenced by the factors including variabilities in the optical properties seasonal patterns of phytoplankton and suspended matter optical remote sensing algorithms have to be different for different water bodies or even the same water body in different regions arst 2003 haas et al 2009 another restriction is that flood monitoring for a certain region at a high spatial resolution with a frequent return period e g daily or near daily repeats can hardly be achieved by only optical satellite observations due to cloud cover dense cloud cover and flooding often goes hand in hand hampering the use of optical satellite data to detect flood extent at least for part of the time an area is inundated during these unsuitable meteorological conditions instead of detecting inundation by optical imagery microwave remote sensing is advantageous due to its cloud penetrating properties woodhouse 2017 the fundamental parameter measured by passive microwave radiometers brightness temperature t b is a measurement of the radiance of the microwave radiation traveling upward from the earth s surface to the satellite alley and jentoft 1999 mcfarland et al 1990 these t b observations can be provided by satellite sensors such as the advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e the scanning multi channel microwave radiometer smmr and the special sensor microwave imager and the special sensor microwave imager sounder ssm i ssmis for the most common sensor channels the low frequency channels of 6 6 and 10 7 ghz ssmr or 6 9 and 10 7 ghz amsr e suffer from radio frequency interferences njoku et al 2005 the 19 and 22 ghz ssm i ssmis or 18 7 and 23 8 ghz amsr e channels are close to the water vapor spectral line which could be susceptible to atmospheric contaminations skou 1989 therefore 36 5 or 37 ghz is optimal for detecting surface water change previous studies have proven that t b data in the h polarization at 36 5 or 37 ghz have the strongest differential response to water and land with a lesser sensitivity to soil moisture e g brakenridge et al 2007 van dijk et al 2016 such remote sensing data can be used to detect changes in surface water areas and thus monitor river discharge changes increased discharge is accompanied by both higher stage and a larger area of surface water brakenridge et al 2005 2012 besides these relative low resolution measurements microwave spaceborne synthetic aperture radar sar sensors can also provide valuable high resolution spatial observations and thus map flood extent henry et al 2006 oberstadler et al 1997 non disturbed surface water acts like a mirror to the side looking beamed radar resulting in dramatically lower backscatter than most non water land cover types this makes water appear very dark in sar images which can thus discriminate water and non water features brivio et al 2002 martinis and voigt 2009 to improve flood mapping accuracy based on sar imagery is one of the research focuses different approaches have been proposed and presented in many successful flood mapping cases e g behnamian et al 2017 bolanos et al 2016 borghys et al 2006 li and wang 2015 martinis et al 2015 schlaffer et al 2015 among them because of the simplicity and expediency threshold based approaches have been extensively used especially in detecting surface water operationally shen et al 2019a b twele et al 2016 selecting an appropriate threshold of the intensity sar imagery to differentiate water from land is critical in these approaches in recent techniques the threshold value can be determined by combining the backscatter image thresholding with segmentation algorithms which involve data or approaches such as active contours e g hahmann et al 2010 object oriented method e g martinis et al 2015 texture information e g bolanos et al 2016 li and wang 2015 and topography data e g bioresita et al 2018 relying on the ancillary data or approaches these techniques often result in high accuracies mainly by reducing image speckle and false classification for flood mapping and in the meanwhile longer processing times to date techniques for flood extent monitoring based on both passive microwave and sar imagery have led to many successful applications to flood detection e g galantowicz and picton 2014 martinis et al 2015 ormsby et al 1985 sippel et al 1994 flood monitoring requires frequent large coverage observations with a high spatial resolution generally observations at an interval of 6 to 12 h with a resolution of 20 m are recommended to successfully map the extent of flash flooding mouratidis and sarti 2013 the time constraint for regular floods can be less critical but daily observations should be achieved yilmaz et al 2010 methods using passive microwave remote sensing can obtain signals at a high frequency e g twice a day however the coarse resolution e g 10 70 km is often impractical for detailed flood mapping in contrast sar sensors such as terrasar x cosmo skymed alos 2 and sentinel 1 achieve much higher spatial resolutions e g up to 1 10 m their repeat cycle is often 6 16 days depending on the latitudinal location on the earth in some instances with sar constellations higher temporal sampling rate can be reached for example repeat time can be occasional 1 day and average 4 day for cosmo skymed milillo et al 2016 and revisit frequency is 3 day at equator and less than 1 day at high latitudes for sentinel 1 torres et al 2012 however such temporal sampling rate can hardly meet the demands of high resolution flood mapping especially of capturing the maximum extent of inundation it is clear that at present neither sar nor passive microwave imaging alone can provide adequate data therefore this paper explores the use of both together 1 2 framework and objectives in this paper we proposed an integrated methodology to combine both passive and active microwave remote sensing algorithms to overcome spatial and temporal restrictions for high resolution flood monitoring specifically this integrated methodology is based on the t b data provided by the making earth system data records for use in research for earth science measures multi platform calibrated brightness temperature earth system data record esdr cetb brodzik et al 2016 and sar images from sentinel 1 satellites torres et al 2012 the main objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of using passive microwave remote sensing data to estimate flood extent combined with sar based flood mapping information this paper was organized as follows first the study area and the test event was introduced followed by a description of the data used for analysis and validation then the proposed methodology was described and applied in these three steps 1 with a high temporal sampling rate t b data were used to derive a daily flood occurrence signal i e m c signal hereinafter using an existing method proposed by brakenridge et al 2007 which was subsequently analyzed to determine the flood time span 2 according to this time span sar imagery from sentinel 1 were selected to produce flood maps at an interval of 12 days with 10 m spatial resolution based on a widely used water land classification algorithm accuracy assessment was performed based on a high resolution geoeye 1 image and the flood inundation result from another reliable source 3 further investigation was conducted to explore how the m c signal correlated with the surface water fraction derived from sar based flood mapping results their relation curve could then be used together with the daily m c signal to provide the dynamic surface water fraction information at a high spatial and temporal resolution 3 125 km 3 125 km daily in the end the significances and limitations of this integrated methodology were discussed and summary and conclusions were drawn 2 study area flood event and data coverage 2 1 study

using imaging reconstruction algorithms developed at brigham young university long and stroeve 2011 the resolution enhancement for the data is channel dependent long 2015 for this study the microwave domain of 37 ghz in the h polarization from the ssmis on the defense meteorological satellite program dmsp was chosen to provide the t b data it has the highest spatial resolution 3 125 km with the temporal resolution of twice a day 2 2 2 sar imagery sentinel 1 is a constellation of two satellites including sentinel 1a launched in april 2014 and sentinel 1b launched in april 2016 by the european space agency esa it provides c band data in two polarization configurations vh and vv with a temporal single pass return period of 12 days at the equator the data are acquired in four modes stripmap sm interferometric wide swath iw extra wide swath ew and wave ww to detect surface water changes related to a flood event we used level 1 ground range detected grd products in iw mode of vh polarization because sar images from sentinel 1b are not available for the flood event only specifications of the sar scenes from sentinel 1a are provided in table 1 6 scenes of pre storm and during flood and table 2 one scene of after flood 2 2 3 reference data geoeye 1 is a high resolution commercial earth observation satellite operated by digitalglobe launched on september 6th 2008 it collects images at a spatial resolution of 0 46 m panchromatic and 1 84 m multispectral 4 bands the satellite uses a low earth sun synchronous orbit with a mean altitude of 681 km and its swath width is 15 2 km we selected one geoeye 1 scene acquired on august 10th 2016 from the digitalglobe gbdx platform https platform digitalglobe com gbdx as around july only on that day both geoeye 1 and sentinel 1 had observations for the study area table 2 shows the parameters of the available geoeye 1 imagery for validation and its corresponding sentinel 1a scene the coverage of this geoeye 1 image is presented in in addition the srtm 1 arc second dem and the river network shapefile from the global river network grin database schneider et al 2017 was used to generate the height above the nearest drainage hand index rennó et al 2008 to reduce falsely classified water pixels derived from the sar images 3 methods we developed a workflow of the new data integration methodology to detect inundation extent over time as shown in fig 2 it includes four major steps 1 generating daily time series of the passive microwave signal i e m c signal see section 3 1 from t b data of the measures cetb product 2 classifying water land based on sentinel 1a sar imagery and assessing the accuracy 3 developing the relation curve between m c signal and surface water fraction derived from sar based water maps from step 2 and 4 generating the daily surface water fraction estimated by m c signal using the relationship developed in step 3 in step 2 the accuracy assessment of water land classification from sar imagery is conducted separately based on the water map derived from the geoeye 1 image and flood inundation mapped by a recently developed nrt system named radar produced inundation diary rapid shen et al 2019a 3 1 processing steps for passive microwave data there is a significant radiation dissimilarity of water and land and therefore the t b data can be used to detect changes in surface water area however t b measurements are often influenced by factors that could vary in time and space such as physical temperature atmosphereattenuation and differences in emissivity and the relative contribution of these factors to the t b value cannot be measured studies have shown that if the contribution of these factors is assumed to be constant over a certain region when comparing a wet pixel measurement pixel hereafter m partly covering a river channel for a potential inundation location with the nearby dry pixel calibration pixel hereafter c only covering land the potential noise caused by the aforementioned factors can be mostly eliminated brakenridge et al 2012 de groeve 2010 specifically the m value is the t b value of the m located on the river including the river channel and parts of the floodplain along it the c value is the brightest 95th percentile to avoid selecting outliers value of the pixels within a 9 9 pixel array centered on the m the m and c values can be expressed via eqs 1 3 1 t b 1 w t b l a n d w t b w a t e r 2 m t b m t m 1 w ε l a n d m w ε w a t e r 3 c t b c t c ε l a n d c where w stands for the surface water fraction of the pixel t b l a n d is the t b of land t b w a t e r is the t b of water t b m is the t b of the m t m is the physical temperature of the m ε l a n d m is the emissivity of the land part of the m t b c is the t b of the c t c is the physical temperature of the c ε l a n d c is the emissivity of the land part of the c and ε w a t e r is the emissivity of water for nearby pixels within a certain area their physical temperatures can be considered as the same and the emissivity of the land portion for each pixel can be assumed to be approximately equal marked as ε l a n d de groeve 2010 shown by eqs 4 and 5 4 ε l a n d m ε l a n d c ε l a n d 5 t m t c then the ratio m c is simplified as a function of w as shown in eq 6 6 m c t b m t b c t m 1 w ε l a n d w ε w a t e r t c ε l a n d 1 w w ε w a t e r ε l a n d f w m c has been proven to have a strong correlation with observed discharge in some regional studies e g brakenridge et al 2005 2012 de groeve et al 2015 it would be more correlated to the surface water fraction than the discharge for the flood occurrence indicator a low ratio of m to c value means high coverage of the pixel by water in this study we used the average value of ascending and descending orbits night and day around 6 35 pm and 6 35 am for dmsp f17 17th flight respectively to best match with the sentinel 1a observation around 10 20 am for scenes in tables 1 and 2 to reduce noise and remove data gaps a 4 day forward running mean was applied generate the time series of daily m c signals because it can fill between any missing days without over smoothing the m c time series 3 2 preprocessing for sar images level 1 grd data was preprocessed using the esa s sentinel 1 toolbox s1tbx embedded in the sentinel application platform snap https sentinel esa int web sentinel toolboxes sentinel 1 after removing the thermal noise sar images were calibrated to directly relate pixel values to radar backscatter which then was filtered using a 7 7 window lee filter lee 1980 this filter can remove the speckle noise by minimizing either the mean square error or the weighted least square estimation for the sar imagery without eliminating fine details jensen 2004 additionally a terrain correction was conducted to compensate for topography induced distortion and then scenes were reprojected to the wgs84 geographic projection after these steps as usually expressed the digital number dn values of each sar scene were converted into backscatter coefficients in decibel db scale as σ 0 at a resolution of 10 m incidence angles range from 1 to 60 78 which can cause a backscatter energy reduction from near to far range to limit the σ 0 variations a widely used cosine based normalization method was applied mladenova et al 2013 7 σ r e f 0 σ θ 0 cos 2 θ r e f cos 2 θ where σ r e f 0 stands for the normalized backscattering coefficient σ θ 0 is the measured backscattering coefficient θ is the incidence angle and θ r e f is the reference angle which is set to be 30 in this study 3 3 flood mapping based on sar images 3 3 1 threshold based algorithm for water land classification threshold based methods are commonly used in unsupervised classification because of its simplicity and flexibility because backscatter of the cross polarized channels hv vh is less affected by wind than that of the co polarized channels hh vv henry et al 2006 schumann et al 2007 the threshold was applied to generate an initial water land classification based on the normalized backscattering coefficient of the vh polarization the threshold value for each sar scene was obtained using the otsu s method otsu 1979 which is an automatic grey level histogram shape based binarization algorithm widely used for sar based classification this method separates water and land pixels for images having a bimodal histogram and is often adopted in sar based flood mapping e g huang et al 2018a li and wang 2015 schlaffer et al 2015 schumann et al 2010 3 3 2 post processing for water land classification instead of using a simple slope or elevation filter to remove potential misclassifications results of the threshold based sar flood algorithm were post processed by the hand index to eliminate the false positive water classification it can be regarded as a normalized dem terrain descriptor to show the terrain s ability of having standing surface water as some riverbank pixels with high slope can also be flooded this index is defined as the height difference between a certain dem pixel and its nearest drainage network pixel large height difference represents high draining ability based on the grin river network and srtm 1 arc second dem data flow direction and flow accumulation were derived to determine the drainage pixels and height difference was then calculated fig 3 shows the hand index for the study area we assume that regions with a hand index above 15 m are not prone to flooding this criterion was then used to remove the pixels which were falsely classified as water due to the shadow effect caused by the steep terrain in the sar images therefore to improve the classification accuracy of the threshold based algorithm in a hydrologically plausible way 3 3 3 flood inundation mapping after the above steps the surface water extent was estimated for each sar images therefore the flood caused inundation can be derived from the water land classification results from a pair of sar images pre storm and during flood if a pixel is classified as water for the during flood scene and as land for the pre storm scene it is defined as an inundation pixel 3 4 water classification based on geoeye 1 data the high resolution geoeye 1 image was used to provide reference water map there are generally two types of index formulation models for water non water classification for near infrared and rgb bands the coefficient model such as the high resolution water index hrwi yao et al 2015 and the ratio model such as the normalized difference water index ndwi mcfeeters 1996 these two typical water indices can be calculated by the following equations respectively 8 h r w i 6 g r 6 5 n i r 0 2 9 n d w i g n i r g n i r where g is the reflectance of the green band r is the reflectance of the red band and nir is the reflectance of the near infrared band after choosing a proper threshold for each water index the ndwi based and hrwi based water classification maps 2 m from the geoeye 1 image can be derived to assess the classification results of both water indices a point set containing 1500 points for each class was extracted based on geoeye 1 imagery by visual interpretation the one with higher accuracy can be used to evaluate the sar based water land classification results 4 results 4 1 m c indicator for flood occurrence considering the pixel size of m is 3 125 km and the major inundation area for the flood event was along this river after a levee failure occurred sites for the m were selected on the jushui river to make the approach easy to apply it is recommended that if chosen properly just one site is needed to develop the relation curve between m c and the observed discharge by previous studies e g brakenridge et al 2007 2012 de groeve et al 2015 in this study after much trial and error two typical sites were chosen to generate the m c time series given their representative geomorphologic features fig 4 a shows the site locations background google map and fig 4 b is the boxplot of the 4 day running mean of the m c signal for each site from march 2008 to april 2016 site 1 covers parts of an active floodplain which inundates when stage height rises while site 2 does not as shown in fig 4 c for both two sites the m c signal presents a seasonal fluctuation which is usually lower during the wet season when discharge is higher corresponding to a decrease in the m value and during the winter period when the surface is covered by snow corresponding to an increase in the c value floods happen very seldom between december to april in this area and thus only low values from may to november are considered as signals of flood occurrence for this flood event m c signal stays in low value almost throughout july 0 943 for site 1 and 0 970 for site 2 as the lowest below the 10th percentile of its long term record see fig 4 b before and after that period the value of it remains at a higher level it can be an indicator of flooding on a daily basis therefore the flood time span was estimated as july 2016 which is consistent with the results of some relevant studies e g http iccr drr bnu edu cn wp content uploads 2016 12 rapid assessment of flood damage and community based risk mapping in flood diversion area case study in wuhan hubei province pdf moreover site 1 shows a lower mean m c signal with a wider range when comparing to site 2 as the floodplain in the river at site 1 can lead to higher m values in dry conditions and lower values when inundated such information can be used to choose the optimal location for the m assuring the m c signal is sensitive enough to flood events 4 2 water map based on geoeye 1 image to classify water and land both of the default threshold values for hrwi and ndwi are around zero guo et al 2017 yao et al 2015 after searching in the neighborhood of zero the thresholds for hrwi and ndwi were set to be 0 and 0 25 respectively in general both water indices of hrwi and ndwi can differentiate water from land with very good accuracies while hrwi outperforms ndwi especially in detecting small water bodies fig 5 a is the false color composite map of a typical subscene of the geoeye 1 image consisting of three main land cover types water crop land and urban area ndwi shows many omission errors near the boundaries of small water bodies and some water bodies were discontinuous see fig 5 b while hrwi can detect most water bodies see fig 5 c and d with an accuracy of 97 47 for the entire geoeye 1 scene see table 3 small water bodies can be reliably detected by hrwi therefore the result of water non water classification by hrwi for the geoeye 1 image is used as reference data to evaluate the sar based classification results the geoeye 1 image validation areas were chosen such that areas hampered by clouds and shades were eliminated the cloud mask was generated using thresholds from gray level histograms of the geoeye 1 scene after atmospheric correction and the shade mask was manually created the classification map based on hrwi was then converted to vector and small polygon patches of areas less than 100 m2 or with a perimeter less than 40 m were deleted the total validation area is 732 71 km2 containing 158 80 km2 of water and 573 91 km2 of non water 4 3 results of the water land classification based on sar images otsu s threshold for water land segmentation was applied for each sar image to provide timely information on flood dynamics the flood extent dynamically extracted by this threshold based method inundated the largest area on july 5th and showed insignificant recession till july 17th 2016 see fig 6 notably the zhangdu lake towards the middle of each subset of the sar images shows a decrease in size from may to july even during flooding the lake is where one of the largest wetland parks in wuhan city is located during summer hydrophytes in the lake grow and prosper and their canopy cover cannot be penetrated by c band radar microwaves subsequently causing the abnormality in flood dynamic changes generally the threshold based method underestimates the extent of small water bodies such as small ponds rice paddies and narrow channels see fig 7 a and b there are two reasons for the underestimation 1 the resolution of 10 m of sar data cannot meet the demand of detecting narrow edge shaped water bodies and 2 the speckle filtering process often results in a mixing of land and water pixels resulting in a reduction of differences between water and land pixels and subsequently limit the ability of differentiating them centers of water bodies are rarely misclassified by the threshold based method but it shows less capability of detecting boundaries of lakes and rivers see fig 7 c and d this can be explained by the existence of surface water roughness like waves and noises caused by the fading effect in sar images dobson et al 1996 4 4 accuracy assessments for water land classification derived from sar imagery 4 4 1 accuracy assessment for water land classification results based on geoeye 1 water map the accuracy assessment see table 4 indicates that the threshold based method can detect water bodies very well with a total accuracy oa score of 89 83 and a kappa coefficient of 0 681 about 70 of water bodies were detected accurately and the error of commission is 19 75 it outperforms some typical supervised classifiers for water mapping see detailed comparisons of accuracy assessments for some commonly used supervised classifiers and the threshold based method classifier in table s1 with a classification accuracy not lower than but processing time much shorter than the other supervised classifiers the threshold based method with the hand index post processor can provide reliable water land classification for each date when sar observation was available 4 4 2 comparison of maximum flood inundation results generated by the threshold based method and the rapid system the rapid system can process each sentinel 1 sar image to map the surface water automatically with a high water land classification accuracy via several steps including the binary classification morphological processing compensation for underestimation and threshold correction shen et al 2019a for this flood event the inundation caused was assumed as the maximum water extent by comparing flood maps of july 5th 2016 during flood scene and may 18th 2016 pre storm scene fig 8 shows the comparison of the maximum flood inundated water extent developed by the threshold based method in red total area 302 km2 and the rapid system in black total area 310 km2 both of the two results show that most of the flood water existed in regions such as floodplains along the jushui river or areas adjacent to other permanent water bodies most inundation is related to the rising water level of the rivers lakes ponds and regions like farmlands and residential areas where depressed areas are widely distributed and prone to hold water also after water levels start to decrease the threshold based method shows a good agreement in inundation mapping with the rapid inundation result as the user s accuracy and producer s accuracy reach 74 4 and 72 8 respectively therefore it can be considered as an effective way to estimate flood dynamics with high confidence 4 5 development and application of the relation curve surface water fraction for the m 3 125 3 125 km2 of site 1 and 2 for each sar image in table 1 and 2 was extracted and compared with the m c signal for the corresponding dates to explore the relationship between m c signal and sar observed surface water fraction the relation curve presented in fig 9 can be applied to combine the passive and active microwave data to monitor daily surface water fraction the m c signal shows a decreasing trend when surface water fraction increases r2 reaches 0 84 when using quadratic polynomial regression therefore interpolating the surface water fraction map for the periods between each sentinel 1 observation at the resolution of 3 125 km can help to monitor the flood situation along a river when sar images are not available bias between surface water fraction computed by passive microwave m c signal estimation and sar observation for may 6th may 30th june 11st july 5th july 17th and august 10th 2016 for river and lake pixels in the jushui river basin outlet site 1 ranges between 20 to 20 with an average of 0 34 see fig 10 a bias for may 18th 2016 was not calculated because there was no passive microwave observation for that day more than 74 of the water pixels show a bias within 10 to 10 which indicates that surface water fraction can be extracted to provide continuous information at a daily interval for flood events using this relationship for the jushui river basin fig 10 b presents the variation of bias for each validation date and the overall of which july 5th shows the largest range and june 11th the least the flood peak was reached around july 4th see fig 4 c which means the flood extent could be very dynamic and changing quickly even within a day due to the mismatch of timescales of sentinel 1a and dmsp f17 observations some bias might be introduced for surface water fraction estimation especially during the flood peak additionally the downscaling algorithm can also introduce uncertainties into the t b data and thus contributed to the bias 5 discussion flood occurrence can be monitored daily using the aforementioned m c signal if the m c signal reaches its low value of the long term record during the rainy season below the 10th percentile in this study a high flood probability should be considered accuracy assessment see table 3 indicates that hrwi increases the water classification accuracy by 1 6 compared with ndwi especially for detecting small water bodies this can be a reliable source of reference data for evaluating sar based water classification results to extract water from sar data the threshold based method based on the otsu s algorithm performs well with a promising overall accuracy of 89 83 and a kappa coefficient of 0 681 in addition factors influencing the accuracy of sar based water classification also include a the limited resolution 10 m comparing to commercial optical imagery 2 m and b uncertainties in the hand index mask derived from the srtm dem data in the proposed integrated methodology it should be noted that the relation curve is site specific as each site can be regarded as a control point of the river basin with its unique geomorphology and hydrologic condition which can affect the coefficients in the regression function generally this relationship should be inverse and can be applied to upstream areas because the m is defined to be a river pixel meaning that only part of the pixel incorporates a river the m c signal can be used to estimate the water and land proportion for areas where permanent water exists due to layover and radar shadow threshold based algorithms for water land classification generally perform better in areas with relatively flat and open terrain schlaffer et al 2015 schumann et al 2011 the proposed methodology is consequently more capable of monitoring floods for these areas if passive microwave data with frequent return periods and sar imagery at high spatial resolutions are available results also show that the integrated methodology is capable of estimating inundation happening a few days after the flood peak however surface water fraction generated by this approach just presents water area percentage at pixel scale 3 125 3 125 km2 and water distribution in sub pixels cannot be calculated it remains a challenge to estimate surface water fraction in more detailed scales due to the limited spatial resolution of passive microwave observation future studies can focus on developing passive microwave products with finer spatial resolutions or combining microwave data with ground information such as the open access high resolution dem suggested by schumann and bates 2018 and river water levels from satellite altimetry e g huang et al 2018b to explore water distribution at the sub pixel level it can help our approach improve its accuracy of flood monitoring results 6 summary and conclusions to overcome spatial and temporal restrictions of microwave remote sensing observation for flooding we proposed an integrated methodology using passive microwave remote sensing signal and sar imagery to monitor and estimate flood occurrence and its dynamics this methodology supports daily monitoring for flood occurrence at selected river locations based on the passive microwave m c signal it can also achieve detailed observations of 10 m resolution for water extent using sentinel 1 sar imagery at an interval of several days depending on latitude with a 5 or 6 day revisit and 12 day same orbit revisit time at the equator furthermore daily surface water fraction at the resolution of 3 125 km can be obtained by combining passive and active microwave observations the main conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows 1 by selecting a suitable location of the measurement pixel m m c signal can be very sensitive to surface water change thus to determine the flood time span for the 2016 flood occurring in the jushui river m c signal shows low values almost for the entire month of july which can be determined as the approximation of the flood duration 2 by determining the threshold using the pattern of backscatter distribution the threshold based method is effective and efficient for detailed flood mapping based on sar imagery based on the water extent map derived from the geoeye 1 image based on the hwri algorithm the accuracy assessment shows the threshold based method has a promising performance for detecting water bodies for the 2016 flood event 3 comparing passive microwave signals with sar observations of site 1 and 2 an equation of m c signal ratio versus sar observed surface water fraction swf was developed as s w f 49674 r a t i o 2 96903 r a t i o 47270 with an r2 of 0 84 which means m c signal can be used to estimate surface water fraction and its change thus to achieve daily monitoring for flood events 4 this methodology results in bias of surface water fraction ranging from 20 to 20 for water pixels of the validation dates see fig 10 showing a good ability in estimating surface water fraction combining both passive and active remote sensing observations surface water fraction for permanent water pixels e g river lake and pond within the jushui river basin can be generated based on m c signals for the days between each sar observation it can improve the temporal continuity of microwave remote sensing observations and thus provide more complete information on flood dynamics this study describes a reliable and efficient methodology to monitor floods which offers continuous information on daily flood dynamics in general based on high resolution microwave remote sensing data this integrated methodology can be applied

5773,monitoring changes in flood extent is critical for flood control and mitigation purposes in areas where flooding affects many people and dense infrastructure and properties remote sensing can be an effective technique to detect changes in surface water extent and its dynamics compared to optical remote sensing microwave information is suitable for working in any weather condition without severe cloud interference usually passive microwave data has a high temporal but a rather coarse spatial resolution whereas for active microwave data this is reversed and only with ideal satellite constellation observations it can reach high sampling rates to overcome these spatial and temporal restrictions we proposed an integrated methodology to combine the passive and active microwave remote sensing and thus provide flood information more frequently at a high resolution in this paper a demonstration of the methodology is presented for a flood event occurring in wuhan hubei province of china in july 2016 the major inundation occurred along the jushui river part of the middle yangtze river basin using the brightness temperature data from a special data set measures a daily passive microwave signal at the resolution of 3 125 km is used as an indicator to monitor flood occurrence and obtain the flood duration over time synthetic aperture radar sar imagery 12 day revisit 10 m spatial resolution from sentinel 1 was processed to estimate high resolution flood extents within the time span of the flood based on a threshold based method together with the high above nearest drainage hand index post processor surface water fraction data generated from sar images presents a strong correlation with the passive microwave signal r2 0 84 when using a quadratic polynomial fit the average bias between surface water fraction computed by the passive microwave signals and sar observations for water pixels within the jushui river basin for the validation dates is 0 34 indicating that this relationship can be applied to interpolate surface water fraction for each pixel along the river and other permanent water bodies for days when sar observations are not available this integrated method takes advantage of both passive and active microwave remote sensing and enriches temporally sparse flood data given the global coverage of the datasets used in this study it can be utilized to estimate flood status for other flood prone areas and thus contribute towards societal flood preparedness and response keywords flood monitoring microwave remote sensing measures cetb sentinel 1 sar 1 introduction 1 1 background monitoring flood inundation extent is critical as flooding is one of the most destructive and devastating natural disasters and is responsible yearly for thousands of fatalities many more displacements and loss of properties and infrastructure hirabayashi et al 2013 jonkman 2005 timely mapping to determine impacted regions over the course of a flood event can be fundamental in providing timely decision support data to emergency responders especially for warning or supporting evacuations in urban areas klemas 2015 additionally a long time record of inundation maps provides important information for many other applications including flood hazard assessment public health management biodiversity conservation water use and urban planning eppink et al 2004 gessner 2014 moel et al 2009 viala 2008 however flood extent is highly dynamic and the terrain of flood prone areas is often complex requiring high resolution data which makes flood extent estimation a challenge brivio et al 2002 current flood monitoring methods can be divided into two main categories hydrological hydraulic modelling and satellite observation bates 2004 bates et al 1997 khan et al 2011 flood monitoring based on hydrological hydraulic models can provide real time guidance for flood control and mitigation if the model is well calibrated and running operationally using high resolution data however information on model inputs such as observed discharge and accurate river morphology are often inadequate for many areas which restricts the applicability of the modelling method gleason et al 2014 pechlivanidis et al 2011 weather data over a large region e g the meteorological forcing inputs provided by coarse resolution satellite estimates or point scale ground observations can also limit the accuracy of hydrological hydraulic modelling tang et al 2018 with rapid development of remote sensing techniques a number of earth observation satellites are monitoring some of the ongoing processes on the earth s surface at multiple spatial and temporal scales providing an alternative way to estimate flood dynamics over time studies have shown that surface water distribution across the globe can be estimated using moderate resolution imagery such as obtained by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis 250 m twice a day brakenridge and anderson 2006 carroll et al 2009 and landsat 30 m once every 8 days frazier and page 2000 pekel et al 2016 however water bodies mapping based on these optical remote sensing images can be complicated even in good weather conditions for example influenced by the factors including variabilities in the optical properties seasonal patterns of phytoplankton and suspended matter optical remote sensing algorithms have to be different for different water bodies or even the same water body in different regions arst 2003 haas et al 2009 another restriction is that flood monitoring for a certain region at a high spatial resolution with a frequent return period e g daily or near daily repeats can hardly be achieved by only optical satellite observations due to cloud cover dense cloud cover and flooding often goes hand in hand hampering the use of optical satellite data to detect flood extent at least for part of the time an area is inundated during these unsuitable meteorological conditions instead of detecting inundation by optical imagery microwave remote sensing is advantageous due to its cloud penetrating properties woodhouse 2017 the fundamental parameter measured by passive microwave radiometers brightness temperature t b is a measurement of the radiance of the microwave radiation traveling upward from the earth s surface to the satellite alley and jentoft 1999 mcfarland et al 1990 these t b observations can be provided by satellite sensors such as the advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e the scanning multi channel microwave radiometer smmr and the special sensor microwave imager and the special sensor microwave imager sounder ssm i ssmis for the most common sensor channels the low frequency channels of 6 6 and 10 7 ghz ssmr or 6 9 and 10 7 ghz amsr e suffer from radio frequency interferences njoku et al 2005 the 19 and 22 ghz ssm i ssmis or 18 7 and 23 8 ghz amsr e channels are close to the water vapor spectral line which could be susceptible to atmospheric contaminations skou 1989 therefore 36 5 or 37 ghz is optimal for detecting surface water change previous studies have proven that t b data in the h polarization at 36 5 or 37 ghz have the strongest differential response to water and land with a lesser sensitivity to soil moisture e g brakenridge et al 2007 van dijk et al 2016 such remote sensing data can be used to detect changes in surface water areas and thus monitor river discharge changes increased discharge is accompanied by both higher stage and a larger area of surface water brakenridge et al 2005 2012 besides these relative low resolution measurements microwave spaceborne synthetic aperture radar sar sensors can also provide valuable high resolution spatial observations and thus map flood extent henry et al 2006 oberstadler et al 1997 non disturbed surface water acts like a mirror to the side looking beamed radar resulting in dramatically lower backscatter than most non water land cover types this makes water appear very dark in sar images which can thus discriminate water and non water features brivio et al 2002 martinis and voigt 2009 to improve flood mapping accuracy based on sar imagery is one of the research focuses different approaches have been proposed and presented in many successful flood mapping cases e g behnamian et al 2017 bolanos et al 2016 borghys et al 2006 li and wang 2015 martinis et al 2015 schlaffer et al 2015 among them because of the simplicity and expediency threshold based approaches have been extensively used especially in detecting surface water operationally shen et al 2019a b twele et al 2016 selecting an appropriate threshold of the intensity sar imagery to differentiate water from land is critical in these approaches in recent techniques

these techniques often result in high accuracies mainly by reducing image speckle and false classification for flood mapping and in the meanwhile longer processing times to date techniques for flood extent monitoring based on both passive microwave and sar imagery have led to many successful applications to flood detection e g galantowicz and picton 2014 martinis et al 2015 ormsby et al 1985 sippel et al 1994 flood monitoring requires frequent large coverage observations with a high spatial resolution generally observations at an interval of 6 to 12 h with a resolution of 20 m are recommended to successfully map the extent of flash flooding mouratidis and sarti 2013 the time constraint for regular floods can be less critical but daily observations should be achieved yilmaz et al 2010 methods using passive microwave remote sensing can obtain signals at a high frequency e g twice a day however the coarse resolution e g 10 70 km is often impractical for detailed flood mapping in contrast sar sensors such as terrasar x cosmo skymed alos 2 and sentinel 1 achieve much higher spatial resolutions e g up to 1 10 m their repeat cycle is often 6 16 days depending on the latitudinal location on the earth in some instances with sar constellations higher temporal sampling rate can be reached for example repeat time can be occasional 1 day and average 4 day for cosmo skymed milillo et al 2016 and revisit frequency is 3 day at equator and less than 1 day at high latitudes for sentinel 1 torres et al 2012 however such temporal sampling rate can hardly meet the demands of high resolution flood mapping especially of capturing the maximum extent of inundation it is clear that at present neither sar nor passive microwave imaging alone can provide adequate data therefore this paper explores the use of both together 1 2 framework and objectives in this paper we proposed an integrated methodology to combine both passive and active microwave remote sensing algorithms to overcome spatial and temporal restrictions for high resolution flood monitoring specifically this integrated methodology is based on the t b data provided by the making earth system data records for use in research for earth science measures multi platform calibrated brightness temperature earth system data record esdr cetb brodzik et al 2016 and sar images from sentinel 1 satellites torres et al 2012 the main objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of using passive microwave remote sensing data to estimate flood extent combined with sar based flood mapping information this paper was organized as follows first the study area and the test event was introduced followed by a description of the data used for analysis and validation then the proposed methodology was described and applied in these three steps 1 with a high temporal sampling rate t b data were used to derive a daily flood occurrence signal i e m c signal hereinafter using an existing method proposed by brakenridge et al 2007 which was subsequently analyzed to determine the flood time span 2 according to this time span sar imagery from sentinel 1 were selected to produce flood maps at an interval of 12 days with 10 m spatial resolution based on a widely used water land classification algorithm accuracy assessment was performed based on a high resolution geoeye 1 image and the flood inundation result from another reliable source 3 further investigation was conducted to explore how the m c signal correlated with the surface water fraction derived from sar based flood mapping results their relation curve could then be used together with the daily m c signal to provide the dynamic surface water fraction information at a high spatial and temporal resolution 3 125 km 3 125 km daily in the end the significances and limitations of this integrated methodology were discussed and summary and conclusions were drawn 2 study area flood event and data coverage 2 1 study area and flood event in southern and central china driven by the strong el niño of 2015 2016 precipitation started earlier and was more pronounced in the summer of 2016 than usual thus resulting in severe flooding tang et al 2017 the xinzhou district in wuhan city of hubei province located along the yangtze river 30 68 n 114 84 e was one of the most affected areas precipitation of record breaking magnitude caused a levee failure on july 1st 2016 on one of the tributaries of the yangtze river the jushui river fig 1 shows the topography of the study area a subset of a sentinel 1a sar scene from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm 1 arc second digital elevation model dem farr et al 2007 with a superimposed flood occurrence map from the global surface water dataset pekel et al 2016 derived from landsat imagery which is provided by the european commission s joint research center jrc permanent water surfaces are defined here as areas that experience 80 100 occurrence of surface water over a 32 year period 1984 to 2015 2 2 data 2 2 1 passive microwave data passive microwave data used in this study is from the measures cetb product https nsidc org data nsidc 0630 released by the national snow and ice data center nsidc it provides global brightness temperature time series generated from data records of the smmr ssm i ssmis and amsr e sensors from 1978 to mid 2017 in the equal area scalable earth grid 2 0 ease grid 2 0 projection brodzik et al 2012 these data have been produced at smoothed 25 km resolution and spatially enhanced resolutions up to 3 125 km using imaging reconstruction algorithms developed at brigham young university long and stroeve 2011 the resolution enhancement for the data is channel dependent long 2015 for this study the microwave domain of 37 ghz in the h polarization from the ssmis on the defense meteorological satellite program dmsp was chosen to provide the t b data it has the highest spatial resolution 3 125 km with the temporal resolution of twice a day 2 2 2 sar imagery sentinel 1 is a constellation of two satellites including sentinel 1a launched in april 2014 and sentinel 1b launched in april 2016 by the european space agency esa it provides c band data in two polarization configurations vh and vv with a temporal single pass return period of 12 days at the equator the data are acquired in four modes stripmap sm interferometric wide swath iw extra wide swath ew and wave ww to detect surface water changes related to a flood event we used level 1 ground range detected grd products in iw mode of vh polarization because sar images from sentinel 1b are not available for the flood event only specifications of the sar scenes from sentinel 1a are provided in table 1 6 scenes of pre storm and during flood and table 2 one scene of after flood 2 2 3 reference data geoeye 1 is a high resolution commercial earth observation satellite operated by digitalglobe launched on september 6th 2008 it collects images at a spatial resolution of 0 46 m panchromatic and 1 84 m multispectral 4 bands the satellite uses a low earth sun synchronous orbit with a mean altitude of 681 km and its swath width is 15 2 km we selected one geoeye 1 scene acquired on august 10th 2016 from the digitalglobe gbdx platform https platform digitalglobe com gbdx as around july only on that day both geoeye 1 and sentinel 1 had observations for the study area table 2 shows the parameters of the available geoeye 1 imagery for validation and its corresponding sentinel 1a scene the coverage of this geoeye 1 image is presented in in addition the srtm 1 arc second dem and the river network shapefile from the global river network grin database schneider et al 2017 was used to generate the height above the nearest drainage hand index rennó et al 2008 to reduce falsely classified water pixels derived from the sar images 3 methods we developed a workflow of the new data integration methodology to detect inundation extent over time as shown in fig 2 it includes four major steps 1 generating daily time series of the passive microwave signal i e m c signal see section 3 1 from t b data of the measures cetb product 2 classifying water land based on sentinel 1a sar imagery and assessing the accuracy 3 developing the relation curve between m c signal and surface water fraction derived from sar based water maps from step 2 and 4 generating the daily surface water fraction estimated by m c signal using the relationship developed in step 3 in step 2 the accuracy assessment of water land classification from sar imagery is conducted separately based on the water map derived from the geoeye 1 image and flood inundation mapped by a recently developed nrt system named radar produced inundation diary rapid shen et al 2019a 3 1 processing steps for passive microwave data there is a significant radiation dissimilarity of water and land and therefore the t b data can be used to detect changes in surface water area however t b measurements are often influenced by factors that could vary in time and space such as physical temperature atmosphereattenuation and differences in emissivity and the relative contribution of these factors to the t b value cannot be measured studies have shown that if the contribution of these factors is assumed to be constant over a certain region when comparing a wet pixel measurement pixel hereafter m partly covering a river channel for a potential inundation location with the nearby dry pixel calibration pixel hereafter c only covering land the potential noise caused by the aforementioned factors can be mostly eliminated brakenridge et al 2012 de groeve 2010 specifically the m value is the t b value of the m located on the river including the river channel and parts of the floodplain along it the c value is the brightest 95th percentile to avoid selecting outliers value of the pixels within a 9 9 pixel array centered on the m the m and c values can be expressed via eqs 1 3 1 t b 1 w t b l a n d w t b w a t e r 2 m t b m t m 1 w ε l a n d m w ε w a t e r 3 c t b c t c ε l a n d c where w stands for the surface water fraction of the pixel t b l a n d is the t b of land t b w a t e r is the t b of water t b m is the t b of the m t m is the physical temperature of the m ε l a n d m is the emissivity of the land part of the m t b c is the t b of the c t c is the physical temperature of the c ε l a n d c is the emissivity of the land part of the c and ε w a t e r is the emissivity of water for nearby pixels within a certain area their physical temperatures can be considered as the same and the emissivity of the land portion for each pixel can be assumed to be approximately equal marked as ε l a n d de groeve 2010 shown by eqs 4 and 5 4 ε l a n d m ε l a n d c ε l a n d 5 t m t c then the ratio m c is simplified as a function of w as shown in eq 6 6 m c t b m t b c t m 1 w ε l a n d w ε w a t e r t c ε l a n d 1 w w ε w a t e r ε l a n d f w m c has been proven to have a strong correlation with observed discharge in some regional studies e g brakenridge et al 2005 2012 de groeve et al 2015 it would be more correlated to the surface water fraction than the discharge for the flood occurrence indicator a low ratio of m to c value means high coverage of the pixel by water in this study we used the average value of ascending and descending orbits night and day around 6 35 pm and 6 35 am for dmsp f17 17th flight respectively to best match with the sentinel 1a observation around 10 20 am for scenes in tables 1 and 2 to reduce noise and remove data gaps a 4 day forward running mean was applied generate the time series of daily m c signals because it can fill between any missing days without over smoothing the m c time series 3 2 preprocessing for sar images level 1 grd data was preprocessed using the esa s sentinel 1 toolbox s1tbx embedded in the sentinel application platform snap https sentinel esa int web sentinel toolboxes sentinel 1 after removing the thermal noise sar images were calibrated to directly relate pixel values to radar backscatter which then was filtered using a 7 7 window lee filter lee 1980 this filter can remove the speckle noise by minimizing either the mean square error or the weighted least square estimation for the sar imagery without eliminating fine details jensen 2004 additionally a terrain correction was conducted to compensate for topography induced distortion and then scenes were reprojected to the wgs84 geographic projection after these steps as usually expressed the digital number dn values of each sar scene were converted into backscatter coefficients in decibel db scale as σ 0 at a resolution of 10 m incidence angles range from 1 to 60 78 which can cause a backscatter energy reduction from near to far range to limit the σ 0 variations a widely used cosine based normalization method was applied mladenova et al 2013 7 σ r e f 0 σ θ 0 cos 2 θ r e f cos 2 θ where σ r e f 0 stands for the normalized backscattering coefficient σ θ 0 is the measured backscattering coefficient θ is the incidence angle and θ r e f is the reference angle which is set to be 30 in this study 3 3 flood mapping based on sar images 3 3 1 threshold based algorithm for water land classification threshold based methods are commonly used in unsupervised classification because of its simplicity and flexibility because backscatter of the cross polarized channels hv vh is less affected by wind than that of the co polarized channels hh vv henry et al 2006 schumann et al 2007 the threshold was applied to generate an initial water land classification based on the normalized backscattering coefficient of the vh polarization the threshold value for each sar scene was obtained using the otsu s method otsu 1979 which is an automatic grey level histogram shape based binarization algorithm widely used for sar based classification this method separates water and land pixels for images having a bimodal histogram and is often adopted in sar based flood mapping e g huang et al 2018a li and wang 2015 schlaffer et al 2015 schumann et al 2010 3 3 2 post processing for water land classification instead of using a simple slope or elevation filter to remove potential misclassifications results of the threshold based sar flood algorithm were post processed by the hand index to eliminate the false positive water classification it can be regarded as a normalized dem terrain descriptor to show the terrain s ability of having standing surface water as some riverbank pixels with high slope can also be flooded this index is defined as the height difference between a certain dem pixel and its nearest drainage network pixel large height difference represents high draining ability based on the grin river network and srtm 1 arc second dem data flow direction and flow accumulation were derived to determine the drainage pixels and height difference was then calculated fig 3 shows the hand index for the study area we assume that regions with a hand index above 15 m are not prone to flooding this criterion was then used to remove the pixels which were falsely classified as water due to the shadow effect caused by the steep terrain in the sar images therefore to improve the classification accuracy of the threshold based algorithm in a hydrologically plausible way 3 3 3 flood inundation mapping after the above steps the surface water extent was estimated for each sar images therefore the flood caused inundation can be derived from the water land classification results from a pair of sar images pre storm and during flood if a pixel is classified as water for the during flood scene and as land for the pre storm scene it is defined as an inundation pixel 3 4 water classification based on geoeye 1 data the high resolution geoeye 1 image was used to provide reference water map there are generally two types of index formulation models for water non water classification for near infrared and rgb bands the coefficient model such as the high resolution water index hrwi yao et al 2015 and the ratio model such as the normalized difference water index ndwi mcfeeters 1996 these two typical water indices can be calculated by the following equations respectively 8 h r w i 6 g r 6 5 n i r 0 2 9 n d w i g n i r g n i r where g is the reflectance of the green band r is the reflectance of the red band and nir is the reflectance of the near infrared band after choosing a proper threshold for each water index the ndwi based and hrwi based water classification maps 2 m from the geoeye 1 image can be derived to assess the classification results of both water indices a point set containing 1500 points for each class was extracted based on geoeye 1 imagery by visual interpretation the one with higher accuracy can be used to evaluate the sar based water land classification results 4 results 4 1 m c indicator for flood occurrence considering the pixel size of m is 3 125 km and the major inundation area for the flood event was along this river after a levee failure occurred sites for the m were selected on the jushui river to make the approach easy to apply it is recommended that if chosen properly just one site is needed to develop the relation curve between m c and the observed discharge by previous studies e g brakenridge et al 2007 2012 de groeve et al 2015 in this study after much trial and error two typical sites were chosen to generate the m c time series given their representative geomorphologic features fig 4 a shows the site locations background google map and fig 4 b is the boxplot of the 4 day running mean of the m c signal for each site from march 2008 to april 2016 site 1 covers parts of an active floodplain which inundates when stage height rises while site 2 does not as shown in fig 4 c for both two sites the m c signal presents a seasonal fluctuation which is usually lower during the wet season when discharge is higher corresponding to a decrease in the m value and during the winter period when the surface is covered by snow corresponding to an increase in the c value floods happen very seldom between december to april in this area and thus only low values from may to november are considered as signals of flood occurrence for this flood event m c signal stays in low value almost throughout july 0 943 for site 1 and 0 970 for site 2 as the lowest below the 10th percentile of its long term record see fig 4 b before and after that period the value of it remains at a higher level it can be an indicator of flooding on a daily basis therefore the flood time span was estimated as july 2016 which is consistent with the results of some relevant studies e g http iccr drr bnu edu cn wp content uploads 2016 12 rapid assessment of flood damage and community based risk mapping in flood diversion area case study in wuhan hubei province pdf moreover site 1 shows a lower mean m c signal with a wider range when comparing to site 2 as the floodplain in the river at site 1 can lead to higher m values in dry conditions and lower values when inundated such information can be used to choose the optimal location for the m assuring the m c signal is sensitive enough to flood events 4 2 water map based on geoeye 1 image to classify water and land both of the default threshold values for hrwi and ndwi are around zero guo et al 2017 yao et al 2015 after searching in the neighborhood of zero the thresholds for hrwi and ndwi were set to be 0 and 0 25 respectively in general both water indices of hrwi and ndwi can differentiate water from land with very good accuracies while hrwi outperforms ndwi especially in detecting small water bodies fig 5 a is the false color composite map of a typical subscene of the geoeye 1 image consisting of three main land cover types water crop land and urban area ndwi shows many omission errors near the boundaries of small water bodies and some water bodies were discontinuous see fig 5 b while hrwi can detect most water bodies see fig 5 c and d with an accuracy of 97 47 for the entire geoeye 1 scene see table 3 small water bodies can be reliably detected by hrwi therefore the result of water non water classification by hrwi for the geoeye 1 image is used as reference data to evaluate the sar based classification results the geoeye 1 image validation areas were chosen such that areas hampered by clouds and shades were eliminated the cloud mask was generated using thresholds from gray level histograms of the geoeye 1 scene after atmospheric correction and the shade mask was manually created the classification map based on hrwi was then converted to vector and small polygon patches of areas less than 100 m2 or with a perimeter less than 40 m were deleted the total validation area is 732 71 km2 containing 158 80 km2 of water and 573 91 km2 of non water 4 3 results of the water land classification based on sar images otsu s threshold for water land segmentation was applied for each sar image to provide timely information on flood dynamics the flood extent dynamically extracted by this threshold based method inundated the largest area on july 5th and showed insignificant recession till july 17th 2016 see fig 6 notably the zhangdu lake towards the middle of each subset of the sar images shows a decrease in size from may to july even during flooding the lake is where one of the largest wetland parks in wuhan city is located during summer hydrophytes in the lake grow and prosper and their canopy cover cannot be penetrated by c band radar microwaves subsequently causing the abnormality in flood dynamic changes generally the threshold based method underestimates the extent of small water bodies such as small ponds rice paddies and narrow channels see fig 7 a and b there are two reasons for the underestimation 1 the resolution of 10 m of sar data cannot meet the demand of detecting narrow edge shaped water bodies and 2 the speckle filtering process often results in a mixing of land and water pixels resulting in a reduction of differences between water and land pixels and subsequently limit the ability of differentiating them centers of water bodies are rarely misclassified by the threshold based method but it shows less capability of detecting boundaries of lakes and rivers see fig 7 c and d this can be explained by the existence of surface water roughness like waves and noises caused by the fading effect in sar images dobson et al 1996 4 4 accuracy assessments for water land classification derived from sar imagery 4 4 1 accuracy assessment for water land classification results based on geoeye 1 water map the accuracy assessment see table 4 indicates that the threshold based method can detect water bodies very well with a total accuracy oa score of 89 83 and a kappa coefficient of 0 681 about 70 of water bodies were detected accurately and the error of commission is 19 75 it outperforms some typical supervised classifiers for water mapping see detailed comparisons of accuracy assessments for some commonly used supervised classifiers and the threshold based method classifier in table s1 with a classification accuracy not lower than but processing time much shorter than the other supervised classifiers the threshold based method with the hand index post processor can provide reliable water land classification for each date when sar observation was available 4 4 2 comparison of maximum flood inundation results generated by the threshold based method and the rapid system the rapid system can process each sentinel 1 sar image to map the surface water automatically with a high water land classification accuracy via several steps including the binary classification morphological processing compensation for underestimation and threshold correction shen et al 2019a for this flood event the inundation caused was assumed as the maximum water extent by comparing flood maps of july 5th 2016 during flood scene and may 18th 2016 pre storm scene fig 8 shows the comparison of the maximum flood inundated water extent developed by the threshold based method in red total area 302 km2 and the rapid system in black total area 310 km2 both of the two results show that most of the flood water existed in regions such as floodplains along the jushui river or areas adjacent to other permanent water bodies most inundation is related to the rising water level of the rivers lakes ponds and regions like farmlands and residential areas where depressed areas are widely distributed and prone to hold water also after water levels start to decrease the threshold based method shows a good agreement in inundation mapping with the rapid inundation result as the user s accuracy and producer s accuracy reach 74 4 and 72 8 respectively therefore it can be considered as an effective way to estimate flood dynamics with high confidence 4 5 development and application of the relation curve surface water fraction for the m 3 125 3 125 km2 of site 1 and 2 for each sar image in table 1 and 2 was extracted and compared with the m c signal for the corresponding dates to explore the relationship between m c signal and sar observed surface water fraction the relation curve presented in fig 9 can be applied to combine the passive and active microwave data to monitor daily surface water fraction the m c signal shows a decreasing trend when surface water fraction increases r2 reaches 0 84 when using quadratic polynomial regression therefore interpolating the surface water fraction map for the periods between each sentinel 1 observation at the resolution of 3 125 km can help to monitor the flood situation along a river when sar images are not available bias between surface water fraction computed by passive microwave m c signal estimation and sar observation for may 6th may 30th june 11st july 5th july 17th and august 10th 2016 for river and lake pixels in the jushui river basin outlet site 1 ranges between 20 to 20 with an average of 0 34 see fig 10 a bias for may 18th 2016 was not calculated because there was no passive microwave observation for that day more than 74 of the water pixels show a bias within 10 to 10 which indicates that surface water fraction can be extracted to provide continuous information at a daily interval for flood events using this relationship for the jushui river basin fig 10 b presents the variation of bias for each validation date and the overall of which july 5th shows the largest range and june 11th the least the flood peak was reached around july 4th see fig 4 c which means the flood extent could be very dynamic and changing quickly even within a day due to the mismatch of timescales of sentinel 1a and dmsp f17 observations some bias might be introduced for surface water fraction estimation especially during the flood peak additionally the downscaling algorithm can also introduce uncertainties into the t b data and thus contributed to the bias 5 discussion flood occurrence can be monitored daily using the aforementioned m c signal if the m c signal reaches its low value of the long term record during the rainy season below the 10th percentile in this study a high flood probability should be considered accuracy assessment see table 3 indicates that hrwi increases the water classification accuracy by 1 6 compared with ndwi especially for detecting small water bodies this can be a reliable source of reference data for evaluating sar based water classification results to extract water from sar data the threshold based method based on the otsu s algorithm performs well with a promising overall accuracy of 89 83 and a kappa coefficient of 0 681 in addition factors influencing the accuracy of sar based water classification also include a the limited resolution 10 m comparing to commercial optical imagery 2 m and b uncertainties in the hand index mask derived from the srtm dem data in the proposed integrated methodology it should be noted that the relation curve is site specific as each site can be regarded as a control point of the river basin with its unique geomorphology and hydrologic condition which can affect the coefficients in the regression function generally this relationship should be inverse and can be applied to upstream areas because the m is defined to be a river pixel meaning that only part of the pixel incorporates a river the m c signal can be used to estimate the water and land proportion for areas where permanent water exists due to layover and radar shadow threshold based algorithms for water land classification generally perform better in areas with relatively flat and open terrain schlaffer et al 2015 schumann et al 2011 the proposed methodology is consequently more capable of monitoring floods for these areas if passive microwave data with frequent return periods and sar imagery at high spatial resolutions are available results also show that the integrated methodology is capable of estimating inundation happening a few days after the flood peak however surface water fraction generated by this approach just presents water area percentage at pixel scale 3 125 3 125 km2 and water distribution in sub pixels cannot be calculated it remains a challenge to estimate surface water fraction in more detailed scales due to the limited spatial resolution of passive microwave observation future studies can focus on developing passive microwave products with finer spatial resolutions or combining microwave data with ground information such as the open access high resolution dem suggested by schumann and bates 2018 and river water levels from satellite altimetry e g huang et al 2018b to explore water distribution at the sub pixel level it can help our approach improve its accuracy of flood monitoring results 6 summary and conclusions to overcome spatial and temporal restrictions of microwave remote sensing observation for flooding we proposed an integrated methodology using passive microwave remote sensing signal and sar imagery to monitor and estimate flood occurrence and its dynamics this methodology supports daily monitoring for flood occurrence at selected river locations based on the passive microwave m c signal it can also achieve detailed observations of 10 m resolution for water extent using sentinel 1 sar imagery at an interval of several days depending on latitude with a 5 or 6 day revisit and 12 day same orbit revisit time at the equator furthermore daily surface water fraction at the resolution of 3 125 km can be obtained by combining passive and active microwave observations the main conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows 1 by selecting a suitable location of the measurement pixel m m c signal can be very sensitive to surface water change thus to determine the flood time span for the 2016 flood occurring in the jushui river m c signal shows low values almost for the entire month of july which can be determined as the approximation of the flood duration 2 by determining the threshold using the pattern of backscatter distribution the threshold based method is effective and efficient for detailed flood mapping based on sar imagery based on the water extent map derived from the geoeye 1 image based on the hwri algorithm the accuracy assessment shows the threshold based method has a promising performance for detecting water bodies for the 2016 flood event 3 comparing passive microwave signals with sar observations of site 1 and 2 an equation of m c signal ratio versus sar observed surface water fraction swf was developed as s w f 49674 r a t i o 2 96903 r a t i o 47270 with an r2 of 0 84 which means m c signal can be used to estimate surface water fraction and its change thus to achieve daily monitoring for flood events 4 this methodology results in bias of surface water fraction ranging from 20 to 20 for water pixels of the validation dates see fig 10 showing a good ability in estimating surface water fraction combining both passive and active remote sensing observations surface water fraction for permanent water pixels e g river lake and pond within the jushui river basin can be generated based on m c signals for the days between each sar observation it can improve the temporal continuity of microwave remote sensing observations and thus provide more complete information on flood dynamics this study describes a reliable and efficient methodology to monitor floods which offers continuous information on daily flood dynamics in general based on high resolution microwave remote sensing data this integrated methodology can be applied

available in many catchments of interest e g he et al 2011 parajka et al 2013 this fact made the topic predictions in basins without observed discharge data ungauged basins attractive and challenging for hydrologists e g parajka et al 2007 sivapalan et al 2003 xu 2003 as a result the international association of hydrological sciences iahs established a decade on predictions in ungauged basins pub 2003 2012 and great progress has been achieved during this period hrachowitz et al 2013 regionalization is defined as the method for predicting runoff in ungauged basins by transferring information from gauged donor to ungauged target catchments e g rojas serna et al 2016 razavi and coulibaly 2013 in general regionalization methods are classified into three categories a spatial proximity methods assume that geographically close catchments have similar hydrological behaviors e g egbuniwe and todd 1976 vandewiele et al 1991 b physical similarity methods assume that catchments with similar physical characteristics have the same hydrological response e g burn and boorman 1993 mcintyre et al 2005 thus the parameter values are transferred to ungauged basins from either geographically close or physically similar gauged basins and c the regression method which is one of the most popular and oldest regionalization approaches oudin et al 2008 links model parameters to physical and climatic catchment characteristics by regression functions and assumes that the relationship is transferable from gauged to ungauged basins e g magette et al 1976 young 2006 many studies have applied and compared regionalization methods for various regions in combination with a wide range of hydrological models however in many cases the conclusion about which method performed best differs largely among the studies for example merz and blöschl 2004 concluded that the spatial proximity method performed better than the regression method for catchments in austria using the hbv model on the other hand young 2006 found that the regression method gave better results than the spatial proximity method in the uk bao et al 2012 concluded that the physical similarity method was best by using the akaike information criterion aic on 55 catchments in china different models were applied for different regions in these studies and therefore many hydrologists claim that the performance of regionalization methods depends on the study area and the choice of hydrological model e g parajka et al 2013 reichl et al 2009 salinas et al 2013 samuel et al 2011 viglione et al 2013 most of the above mentioned studies only used one hydrological model in a specific region and conclusions cannot be drawn on how the model selection or study region affects the performance of the regionalization methods few studies have assessed the performance of regionalization methods using multiple models li and zhang 2017 used simhyd 10 model parameters and xaj 12 model parameters in australia and found consistent regionalization results for both models the same conclusion was drawn by li et al 2014 where gr4j 7 model parameters and simhyd 12 model parameters were applied in the southeast tibetan plateau furthermore petheram et al 2012 conducted a comparison by using five rainfall runoff models and concluded that the difference between hydrological models was negligible for runoff prediction in ungauged basins this conclusion was consistent with two other studies chiew 2010 viney et al 2009b which also included five hydrological models however none of these studies included a regression approach which provided very different results when used with either the gr4j 4 model parameters or topmo 6 model parameters model in the study of oudin et al 2008 who tested three kinds of regionalization methods using two hydrological models for 913 catchments in france either the number of regionalization methods or the number of models used in previous studies is still too small to draw a general conclusion in addition all these evaluations have been performed for relatively warm climate regions where the snow process is of limited importance thus a more comprehensive study is needed to investigate how regionalization performance differs with multiple hydrological models of different complexity for runoff prediction in ungauged basins especially for cold and seasonally snow covered regions furthermore climate is changing ipcc 2014 resulting in nonstationary relationships between rainfall and runoff zhang et al 2011 which makes the reliability of applying the conclusions made in a historical period into future application questionable thus for future runoff prediction in ungauged basins it is essential to investigate the transferability of the regionalization methods under changing climatic conditions e g broderick 2016 yang et al 2019 finally regionalization performances also vary between regions according to parajka et al 2013 who statistically summarized this conclusion from 34 regionalization studies however it cannot explicitly present the performance difference between regions for specifically selected regionalization methods because different hydrological models and regionalization methods were applied in the studies cited and summarized by parajka et al 2013 in this study we perform a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of five widely used regionalization methods see section 3 2 combined with four frequently used hydrological models gr4j 6 parameters wasmod 8 parameters hbv 13 parameters and xaj 17 parameters in regions with highly contrasting physiographic and climatic settings the evaluation is based on 86 catchments in norway belonging to three different climatic regions according to the köppen geiger classification kottek et al 2006 and under different climate conditions this is the first study that specifically addresses how the performance of the regionalization methods a depends on the selection of hydrological models b changes in different climate conditions i e when air temperature increases and c varies between different climate regions as defined by the köppen geiger classification 2 study area and data 2 1 study area our study catchments are located in norway which is situated in northern europe in the western and northern part of the scandinavian peninsula norway has a long and rugged coastline elevation spanning from sea level to 2469 m a sl and latitudes ranging from 58 to 71 n this results in highly variable hydroclimatological conditions across the study domain vormoor et al 2016 yang et al 2018 2019 in this study we used data from 86 nonoverlapping catchments distributed evenly throughout our study domain figure 1 these stations have continuous meteorological data and discharge data records with less than 40 missing values during the periods from 1980 to 1989 as well as 2006 to 2015 these two periods are used in this study the left panel map in figure 1 also displays the köppen geiger climate classification which is based on data from 1976 to 2000 kottek et al 2006 peel et al 2007 beck et al 2018 note that the original classification divided norway into five different climate groups however in two of these groups less than 10 catchments were located we therefore merged some of the groups resulting in the following three regions a oceanic climate containing 19 catchments b continental climate containing 52 catchments and c polar tundra climate containing 15 catchments 2 2 data for the hydrological simulations we used daily precipitation and temperature data acquired from the gridded senorge dataset with a resolution of 1 km produced by the norwegian meteorological institute tveito et al 2005 mohr 2009 jansson 2007 daily discharge data were obtained from the hydrometric observation network of the norwegian water resources and energy directorate nve to test the performance of the regionalization methods under varying climate conditions we analyzed the precipitation and temperature records for the period from 1980 to 2015 figure 2 for precipitation there is no clear trend whereas temperature increases throughout the study period for model calibration and verification we selected ten years at the start 1980 to 1989 and the end 2006 to 2015 of the whole period since these two periods show the largest difference in air temperature for the first period the average precipitation is 1932 mm year and the air temperature is 1 2 c for the second period the average precipitation is 2027 mm year and the air temperature is 2 6 c the right panels in figure 2 show the average monthly precipitation temperature and pardé coefficient ratio between the average monthly discharge and the mean annual runoff for the catchments in each climatic group the oceanic climate group is characterized by higher precipitation during autumn and winter and higher air temperature than that of the two remaining groups the watersheds in the oceanic climate group also show two peaks in runoff compare the pardé coefficient between the groups resulting from spring snowmelt and strong rainfall during autumn the continental climate group displays low seasonality for precipitation but high seasonal variations in temperature resulting in one peak runoff caused by snowmelt the climate characteristics for the polar tundra climate group are similar to those of the continental group but with lower temperature and the snowmelt induced peak in runoff occurs later table 1 shows the average annual and seasonal precipitation temperature and runoff for the three climate classes precipitation in the oceanic climate group is substantially larger than that in the other two groups which show rather similar precipitation amounts for temperature the oceanic climate group shows the highest values whereas the coldest temperatures are recorded in the polar tundra climate group in particular for the oceanic group precipitation increases from the calibration to verification period for the winter season but for the summer season the difference is small between the two periods for temperature the increase from the calibration to verification period is smallest in the oceanic region compared to the other regions the seasonal characteristics in runoff are similar to those of precipitation note that summer runoff decreases from the calibration to the verification period for all groups since there is no potential evapotranspiration ep data available in our study area which are needed as the input data for the hydrological models we applied the hargreaves equation hargreaves 1975 to calculate ep mm day which is recommended by shuttleworth 1993 and xu and singh 2002 1 e p 0 0023 r a t c 17 8 tr where r a is the extraterrestrial radiation for the location in mm day evaporation equivalent allen et al 1998 tc is the temperature c and tr is the daily temperature range c a set of catchment descriptors is needed for two of the regionalization methods namely the physical similarity and regression methods see table 2 these catchment descriptors were used in yang et al 2018 2019 similar catchment descriptors have been used in several studies for evaluating regionalization methods e g he et al 2011 mcintyre et al 2005 merz and blöschl 2004 3 methods 3 1 hydrological models four widely used conceptual rainfall runoff models running at a daily time step were selected for the analysis in this study and a snow module was included in the models since runoff in many of the catchments is strongly affected by the accumulation and melting of snow the number of model parameters varies from 6 to 17 between the models after adding the snow routine figure 3 shows the model structures and a description of the parameters is available in table 3 gr4j génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier is a model based on unit hydrograph principles with four free parameters perrin et al 2003 it has been widely used in regionalization studies worldwide such as in france oudin et al 2008 china li et al 2014 and australia zhang et al 2014 2016 we coupled the gr4j model with a degree day type snow module called cemaneige that was developed by valéry 2010 this snow module allows us to estimate snowmelt and simulate snowpack evolution using two additional parameters and the coupling of gr4j and cemaneige has been tested in other studies e g coron et al 2014 hublart et al 2015 wasmod the water and snow balance modelling system is a model with simple structure and has been validated in many different climate regions e g xu and singh 2002 li et al 2013 2015 widén nilsson et al 2007 xu and halldin 1997 for regionalization studies it has been applied in sweden xu 2003 denmark muller wohlfeil et al 2003 and norway yang et al 2018 2019 the version of wasmod used in this study has eight free parameters hbv hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning is a popular model used for runoff simulation in both gauged and ungauged basins for regionalization studies it has been applied in different climate regions such as austria e g merz and blöschl 2004 parajka et al 2005 sweden seibert and beven 2009 china jin et al 2009 canada samuel et al 2011 and the us pool et al 2017 in our study we followed the structure and formulas in the hbv light version seibert and vis 2012 which includes a snow routine soil moisture routine response function and routing routine in total this model has thirteen calibration parameters the xaj xin an jiang model was developed for humid regions in china by zhao et al 1980 1992 and has since become a widely used model in flood forecasting water resources assessment and climate change assessments the original model consists of modules for computing evapotranspiration runoff production runoff separation and flow routing it has also been applied in many regionalization studies e g zhang and chiew 2009 li et al 2009 2017 we implemented the structure shown in lin et al 2014 without the muskingum routing module because our catchments are rather small in size with steep slopes and therefore river flow routing is not an important process li et al 2014 however there is no snow module in xaj and therefore we coupled it with the cemaneige snow module see description of the gr4j model above this model system contains seventeen parameters in total 3 2 regionalization methods spatial proximity physical similarity and regression methods are commonly used in regionalization studies e g oudin et al 2008 petheram et al 2012 hrachowitz et al 2013 for spatial proximity and physical similarity methods which are classified as distance based regionalization methods according to he et al 2011 the model parameter values in ungauged catchments are transferred from gauged donor catchments for the regression method the model parameter values in ungauged catchments are determined by regression functions established using data from gauged basins the regression method in this study is principal component regression pcr which couples principal component analysis pca with the multiple linear regression method using pca a set of observations of possibly correlated catchment descriptors is converted into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components then the relationships among model parameters and selected catchment descriptors are established using multiple linear regression finally these functions are used for estimating model parameters in the ungauged catchments table 4 describes the equations and assumptions for the regionalization methods applied in this study for distance based regionalization methods i e spatial proximity and physical similarity two approaches are often used for transferring the model parameters from the gauged donor to the ungauged target catchments e g mcintyre et al 2005 oudin et al 2008 a for the so called parameter averaging option the model parameters from the donor catchments are first averaged and then used to run the model for the target catchment b for the so called output averaging option the model is first run using the parameter sets from the donor catchments i e basins with runoff where model calibration is possible on the target catchment and the outputs from the model are then averaged as a result there are five regionalization approaches used in this study as shown in table 5 for a more detailed description please see yang et al 2018 2019 3 3 performance evaluation 3 3 1 model calibration and verification in this study we applied a widely used objective function proposed by viney et al 2009a when calibrating the models this objective function is a weighted combination of the nash and sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 and a logarithmic penalty function based on the bias as follows 2 f n s e 5 l n 1 b i a s 2 5 where 3 nse 1 q sim q obs 2 q obs q obs 2 4 bias q sim q obs q obs qobs represents the observed runoff and qsim represents the simulated runoff f values can vary from to the optimal value of 1 this objective function can come close to maximizing nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse and minimizing the bias at the same time vaze et al 2010 for the calibration process we used a standard gradient based automatic optimization method lagarias et al 1998 implemented in the matlab software package fmincon function matlab r2016b the mathworks inc natick massachusetts united states the split sample test is commonly used for model verification aiming to show the model validity in different climate conditions e g coron et al 2012 xu 1999 klemeš 1986 in the current study we evaluate the model performance for 1980 1989 and 2006 2015 and the temperature and precipitation in the latter period are approximately 1 4 c and 5 higher than that in the first period 3 3 2 evaluation of regionalization methods we performed three different evaluations of the regionalization methods in the first evaluation the performance of the regionalization methods was tested for all models using data from the calibration period aiming to show the differences among the models in this step we applied a leave one out cross verification method as in many other studies e g yang et al 2018 mcintyre et al 2005 in the second analysis we repeated the same evaluation but for the warmer and wetter verification period this analysis thus tests the transferability of both the regionalization methods and hydrological models under climate change conditions e g broderick 2016 li et al 2012 in the final evaluation we summarize and discuss the performance of the regionalization methods for the three different climatic regions see section 2 1 since the climate is changing to be warmer in the future ipcc 2014 the following regionalization performance for different climate conditions is investigated from 1980 to 1989 calibration to 2006 2015 verification 3 3 3 evaluation criteria to investigate the performance from different aspects we applied four different criteria in this study the calibration function f eq 2 is the first selection since it considers both the goodness of fit and the water balance aspects between the simulated and observed runoff nse eq 3 is the second evaluation criterion which is the most commonly used criterion in hydrology to measure the fit of the hydrographs between the observed and simulated runoff and is relatively sensitive to high flow e g oudin et al 2008 pushpalatha et al 2012 zhang and chiew 2009 thus we included another criterion nselog which is based on the same formulation as nse but computed on logarithmic transformed flows and with more emphasis on low flow e g oudin et al 2008 pushpalatha et al 2012 finally the percentage of bias pbias eq 4 is applied to measure the average tendency of the simulation to be larger or smaller than the observed counterparts the range for f nse and nselog is 1 where 1 means the simulated runoff perfectly fits the observed runoff and less than 0 suggests that the model is no better than the observed mean value for pbias it varies between with the optimal value equal to 0 and worse performance for water balance simulation if the absolute pbias is larger 4 results 4 1 hydrological model performance in cross verification before evaluating both the hydrological models and the regionalization methods we first assessed the performance of the models by a split sample test figure 4 presents the cumulative density function cdf curves for all hydrological models over 86 catchments measured by f value during 1980 1989 and 2006 2015 for the first calibration period 1980 1989 the left panel in figure 4 the cdf curves from all the hydrological models stay close and xaj appears to be slightly better the average f value is approximately 0 75 for xaj 0 73 for wasmod 0 72 for hbv and 0 69 for gr4j in the verification period 2006 2015 the models perform differently meaning the temporal transferability varies between the hydrological models however the best performance is still produced by xaj whose mean f value is approximately 0 68 followed by wasmod 0 64 the hbv model shows the worst performance with a mean f value of approximately 0 61 and the highest degradation of performance between the calibration and verification periods the results in the right panel calibration in 2006 2015 and verification in 1980 1989 shows very similar characteristics to those in the left panel xaj produced the best performance for both the calibration and the verification periods following the rating classification from moriasi et al 2007 who labeled the performance as good if nse is larger than 0 65 and pbias is less than 15 the f values larger than 0 61 are considered good model performance considering the average aspect all mean f values for our split sample test are higher than 0 61 thus all hydrological models applied in the current study are classified as good performing models for runoff simulation for both calibration and verification periods table 6 gives the average model performance corresponding to the split sample test by using other assessment criteria first regarding the water balance aspect all models yield similarly good performance for both subperiods with pbias values smaller than 5 second the model performance measured by nse shows consistent findings with the results from the f value i e a the models show similar performance in the calibration period but perform differently in the verification period b xaj is considered the best performing model for both the calibration and the verification cases and c hbv shows the largest decline in performance from the calibration to the verification period this similarity between the results from the f value and nse can be explained by the small pbias for all the simulation results finally according to the results of nselog which is more sensitive to low flow the simple models gr4j and wasmod display higher values in the calibration period while wasmod and xaj show better performance in the verification period considering the performance loss from calibration to verification relatively larger degradation appears for the nselog than for the nse and pbias especially for the gr4j model 4 2 evaluation of regionalization methods 4 2 1 influence of the number of donor catchments on performance under stationary conditions figure 5 shows that the output averaging option gives better average performance than the parameter averaging option in both spatial proximity and physical similarity methods and for all the models except for the case of one donor catchment where both options provided the identical results as expected when considering the number of donor catchments the largest increase in performance typically occurs when changing from using one donor catchment to using two donor catchments with the parameter option for xaj as the only exception this is in line with earlier studies that the number of donor catchments typically affects the performance of distance based regionalization methods e g oudin et al 2008 yang et al 2018 however the number of donor catchments providing the best performance differs among the hydrological models and regionalization methods for instance for xaj two donor catchments give the best results for sp out whereas 8 donor catchments are needed for hbv to achieve the optimal performance finally the difference in performance between the output and parameter averaging options increases with the number of model parameters for example the difference in the average f value between the two options for the gr4j model was approximately 0 025 and increased to 0 075 for xaj thus when using a model with many parameters it is more important to use the output averaging option to achieve optimal performance for runoff simulations in ungauged basins the physical similarity methods require fewer donor catchments to achieve optimal performance for runoff simulations in ungauged basins compared to that for the spatial proximity methods table 7 on average the best performance by the physical similarity methods was produced by 3 donor catchments whereas the corresponding number for the spatial proximity methods was 8 it is also noteworthy that the parameter averaging option requires fewer donor catchments than the output averaging option for both the physical similarity and the spatial proximity methods therefore for practical applications it is highly recommended to analyze the relationship between the regionalization performance and the number of donor catchments to choose the best configuration to obtain the optimal results for each case 4 2 2 regionalization performance assessment for all catchments as discussed in section 2 2 figure 2 and table 1 the climate conditions especially air temperature differed between 1980 and 1989 and 2006 2015 this section presents the influence of climate conditions on regionalization performance when the models are calibrated in 1980 1989 the evaluation results presented here applied the optimized number of donor catchments for each method and model as shown in table 7 4 2 2 1 comparison of regionalization performance between hydrological models figure 6 shows the distribution of f values as split violin plots for the five regionalization methods and four hydrological models for both the calibration and verification periods foremost for all the hydrological models the regionalization methods applying the output averaging option sp out and phy out showed better performance than the parameter averaging option sp par and phy par and the regression method is the worst compare black dots with circles this ranking applies for both the calibration and the verification periods where the methods with output averaging options presented more negative skewed distributions and higher mode values than those of the other methods on the other hand for both periods the difference in the average performance between the regionalization methods is smaller for gr4j than for the other models this difference seems to increase with the number of model parameters and is thus largest for xaj for instance in the calibration period the range in the average f values between the regionalization methods equals 0 04 for gr4j and 0 09 for xaj finally from the calibration to verification period performances decreased for all the hydrological models and regionalization methods but to various extents measured by the decrease in the overall mean f values from the calibration solid line to verification dashed line period hbv and xaj displayed larger declines in performance than those of gr4j and wasmod figure7 compares the regionalization performance in terms of the average values of pbias nse and nselog for all catchments using four hydrological models in the calibration and verification periods appendix a presents the violin plot for the evaluation criteria over all the tested catchments regarding the water balance simulation all average values of pbias vary within 10 10 the smallest water balance error for regionalized runoff simulation varies with the hydrological models and regionalization methods in general sp out and phy out tend to yield smaller errors for water balance simulation than those of the other methods the nse results give similar findings as the f value first sp out and phy out methods perform best for all the hydrological models with all average nse values larger than 0 6 and pcr performs worst second the difference in nse between the regionalization methods increases with the growing number of parameters for the hydrological models for example the regionalization performance in the calibration period ranges within 0 57 0 61 for gr4j and 0 57 0 67 for xaj third relatively larger degradation of the average regionalization performance is found using the hbv and xaj models from the calibration to the verification period for the low flow evaluation the regionalization methods with the output average option sp out and phy out substantially outperform the other methods and the performance differences between the regionalization methods are more distinct for hbv and xaj furthermore the average performance of the regionalization methods is highly influenced by the hydrological models in this study wasmod and hbv produced the highest and lowest average nselog values for the regionalization methods respectively compared with the results from the nse and f values the evaluation by nselog presents a more recognizable performance difference between the regionalization methods and hydrological models as well as the difference between the two subperiods 4 2 2 2 comparison of performance between regionalization methods figure 8 compares the performance difference in terms of nse and nselog between the hydrological models for each regionalization method during the calibration and verification periods we omit the results of the f value and pbias in the following analysis due to high similarity between the results from the f value and nse see figure 6 and appendix a and small average pbias values see figure 7 according to the average nse values xaj is considered the best hydrological model for all the distance based regionalization methods and the second best model for pcr gr4j shows the best results for pcr but the difference in performance between the models the gray bars for pcr is smallest among the regionalization methods indicating that the hydrological models have relatively smaller influence on the regression method than on the distance based methods however this difference is enhanced from the calibration to the verification period indicating a larger influence of the hydrological model on future runoff predictions according to nselog wasmod shows the best performance for all the regionalization methods and for both periods in general a larger difference between the hydrological models appears for low flows indicated by nselog than for high flows indicated by nse 4 2 3 assessment of regionalization performance for different climatic regions the three climatic regions shown in figure 1 display very different runoff regimes particularly between the oceanic and the two remaining groups figure 2 for illustration purposes the dependence of the performance of the regionalization methods on the geographical regions as measured by nse is shown in figure 9 it is seen that the oceanic region presented generally better regionalization performance than that of the other two regions whose performance variation was smaller as well only four performance classes shown on the figure then some common characteristics are presented in all the regions first when considering the regionalization methods the output averaging option tended to give higher performance than all the other methods when focusing on the hydrological models xaj showed the best performance in most cases for both the calibration and verification periods otherwise none of the remaining models consistently showed better results than the other models for all climatic regions and regionalization methods finally gr4j produced the lowest variation in performance within the climatic regions between the regionalization methods in almost all cases from the calibration to verification period the highest ranking for xaj with sp out and phy out methods did not change 5 discussion 5 1 hydrological model performance according to the performance classification presented by moriasi et al 2007 the split sample test result in our study indicated that all the hydrological models were able to provide good simulations of runoff for both the calibration and the verification periods especially for the water balance simulation the mean values of pbias for all the studied models are smaller than 5 according to the evaluations in the calibration period based on the f value and nse in our study area xaj is the best performing model and the performance tends to decrease with a decrease in the number of parameters for the hydrological models this finding is in line with the statement that increasing the number of model parameters can lead to better performance during the calibration period e g perrin et al 2001 petheram et al 2012 parajka et al 2013 however the result in terms of low flow simulation evaluations by nselog did not support that statement for example wasmod outperformed xaj and hbv for both subperiods therefore further study is needed to assess the relationship between hydrological model complexity and performance in terms of low flow furthermore for the verification results the performances among the models varied substantially the degradation of performance is quite similar between the hydrological models evaluating by the f value and nse but distinct differences are shown in the nselog results it reminds us that specific criteria are needed for evaluation of hydrological models when the emphasis stands on low flow or draughts regarding the model performance change from the calibration to the verification period the model performance of the xaj model did not vary substantially this is incompatible with earlier findings which suggest that a complex model tends to have less stable performance than simple models in the verification period e g perrin et al 2001 holländer et al 2009 this phenomenon might relate to the model structure for instance the runoff concentration in the xaj model includes surface runoff interflow runoff and groundwater runoff with three parameters that may better represent the processes in our study catchments 5 2 evaluation of regionalization methods 5 2 1 influence of the number of donor catchments on performance to test the influence of the number of donor catchments on model performance we examined the relationship between regionalization performance and the number of donor catchments for all the models with distance based methods the results indicate that using one donor catchment which might be either the spatially nearest or physically most similar watershed gives worse results than using a set of donor catchments this conclusion is supported by all the tested models in our study which is in line with previous findings e g arsenault and brissette 2014 oudin et al 2008 multiple donor catchments typically provide more information than single donor catchments which may explain the behavior described above e g viney et al 2009b however the output averaging option might tend to smooth the flow variability as the number of donor catchments increases this is especially the case if the donors give models with different time lags between rainfall and peak flow therefore the smoothing effect and trade off between the benefits of gains in performance with more information and loss of performance due to this possible smoothing is worth further investigation in future studies our results additionally confirmed that the output averaging option provided better performance than the parameter averaging option in all the model and method combinations e g oudin et al 2008 bao et al 2012 yang et al 2018 since we applied hydrological models with different complexities and number of parameters a promising and new finding is presented in this study the difference in performance between the parameter averaging and output averaging options increases with the number of model parameters see figure 5 first this result can be explained by the nonlinear independence influence between model parameters thus transferring the linearly interpolated individual model parameter value the parameter averaging option will lead to unreasonable model parameters and results bárdossy 2007 second hydrological models with more parameters tend to increase the interaction between their parameters e g perrin et al 2003 poissant et al 2017 hence we should consider the model parameters as a whole set rather than individual values for regionalization research as suggested by bárdossy 2007 and oudin et al 2008 some previous studies used one donor catchment for regionalization evaluation according to spatial or physical similarity and concluded that the difference in performance between hydrological models is negligible e g viney et al 2009b chiew 2010 petheram et al 2012 however in the current study xaj produced distinct results from the other models see figure 5 results with 1 donor catchment which suggests that the performance of regionalization methods is affected by the choice of hydrological models even with one donor catchment 5 2 2 assessment over hydrological models although we claimed that the methods with the output averaging option sp out and phy out produced better performance than the other methods it is difficult to determine the most appropriate method between the spatial proximity sp out and physical similarity phy out methods also valid for excluding the influence on the hydrological model performance of calibration and verification see appendix b this is consistent with the evaluation by using one hydrological model monthly wasmod in the same area by yang et al 2018 according to the explanation from oudin et al 2008 it is not possible to decide which approach sp out or phy out is the most appropriate one when the streaming network density is lower than 60 stations per 100 000 km2 as we used four hydrological models at different complexity levels this result additionally confirmed that this assertion is independent of the selection of hydrological models investigating the model preference for regionalization methods from different aspects xaj should be preferred when the evaluation is more focused on high flow while wasmod should be considered for low flow analysis this result is consistent with the model performance for gauged catchments see figure 4 and table 6 this result tends to support the claim that there is no incentive to prefer a parsimonious hydrological model for regionalization studies rather than a model with adequate complexity arsenault et al 2015 poissant et al 2017 however hydrological models with fewer parameters are recommended when no preknowledge about the regionalization performance is available since the performance difference between the regionalization methods is relatively smaller for the regression method the model with more parameters works worse probably due to the stronger interaction influence when increasing the number of parameters e g perrin et al 2003 poissant et al 2017 another limitation of the regression method is that not all the functions for the model parameters follow the linear assumption e g blöschl 2005 and poor performance results from the accumulated errors 5 2 3 assessment in different climatic regions according to both the nse and nselog results sp out and phy out perform best for all the climatic regions therefore it seems reasonable to conclude that the selection of the climatic region has no large effect on the ranking of regionalization methods however the average regionalization performance in the oceanic climate region is substantially better and varies within a smaller range than in the other two cold regions this indicates that the uncertainty in the selection of regionalization methods is larger in cold and dry regions than in warm and wet regions see figure 2 due to the limited number of catchments in the oceanic climate and polar tundra climate regions further comprehensive studies are needed to conclude the preferences of hydrological models and regionalization methods over various regions 6 conclusions the main aim of this study was to investigate how different combinations of regionalization methods hydrological models and climate conditions will influence the overall performance of hydrological simulations in ungauged basins we assessed the performance of four hydrological models and five regionalization schemes a under stationary climate conditions to test how the performance of the regionalization methods depends on the choice of hydrological models b under different climate conditions to assess the stability in performance of the hydrological models and regionalization methods as climate changes and c in different climatic regions to test how the performances of the simulations vary between these regions the study was performed using data from 86 catchments in norway covering three climatic groups according to the köppen geiger classification in this study we found that for all the hydrological models the distance based approaches with the output averaging option sp out and phy out always outperformed the other tested methods especially for the low flow estimation second the difference in performance between the output and parameter averaging options is not stable and positively increases with the number of parameters for the hydrological models from our study the performance difference between these options is the largest for xaj and the smallest for gr4j third the performance difference among the regionalization methods was smaller for models with fewer parameters gr4j and wasmod compared to that of the models with more tunable parameters hbv and xaj regarding the model influence on regionalization performance xaj is recommended as the best performing model according to the evaluations by nse and f values whereas nselog recommends wasmod as the best through the evaluation furthermore clear differences in general were displayed for three climatic regions and oceanic climatic regions provided the best performance and smallest variance over the regionalization methods and hydrological models moreover the difference in hydrological model performance seems smaller among the regionalization methods than among the climate regions from calibration to verification periods the general performance for the regionalization methods did not show large degradations although this study produced some solid conclusions that were not available before there are some limitations of the current study compared with the general evaluation of hydrograph fit and water balance assessment with emphasis on low flow showed more contrasting results which requires closer attention in future work in addition studies with more different hydrological models are needed to show the influence of hydrological model selection on regionalization performance moreover studies with more contrast in climate conditions are recommended to investigate the transferability of conclusions across climate regions and climate changing conditions which is

5774,hydrological models have been widely used to predict runoff in regions with observed discharge data and regionalization methods have been extensively discussed for providing runoff predictions in ungauged basins pub especially during the pub decade 2003 2012 great progress has been achieved in the field of regionalization in previous studies in which different hydrological models have been coupled with various regionalization methods however different conclusions have been drawn due to the use of different hydrological models regionalization methods and study regions in this study we assessed the performance of the five most widely used regionalization methods spatial proximity with parameter averaging option sp par spatial proximity with output averaging option sp out physical similarity with parameter averaging option phy par physical similarity with output averaging option phy out and regression methods pcr and four daily rainfall runoff models gr4j wasmod hbv and xaj with 6 8 13 and 17 parameters respectively at the same time our aim was to evaluate how the performance of the regionalization methods depends on a the selection of hydrological models b nonstationary climate conditions and c different climatic regions this investigation used data from 86 independent catchments evenly distributed throughout norway covering three different climate zones oceanic continental and polar tundra according to the köppen geiger classification the results showed that a the sp out and phy out methods performed better than the sp par and phy par for all the hydrological models and the regression method performed worst in most cases b the difference between the parameter averaging option and the output averaging option is positively related to the number of hydrological model parameters i e the greater the number of parameters the larger the difference between the two options c the xaj model with the greatest number of parameters produced the best results in most cases and models with fewer parameters tend to produce similar performance for the different regionalization methods d models with more parameters displayed larger declines in performance than those with fewer parameters for nonstationary conditions and e clear differences in the performance of the regionalization methods exist among the three climatic regions this study provides insight into the relationship between the complexity of hydrological models and regionalization methods in cold and seasonally snow covered regions keywords regionalization methods hydrological models climatic zones ungauged catchments 1 introduction runoff prediction plays a significant and essential role in water resources management the assessment of the impact of environmental change e g climate and land use and hydrological design e g blöschl and montanari 2010 parajka et al 2013 during the last several decades hydrological models have become the most popular and common solution for runoff predictions however the models have free parameters to be calibrated by using the observed discharge data before predicting the runoff hydrographs which are not available in many catchments of interest e g he et al 2011 parajka et al 2013 this fact made the topic predictions in basins without observed discharge data ungauged basins attractive and challenging for hydrologists e g parajka et al 2007 sivapalan et al 2003 xu 2003 as a result the international association of hydrological sciences iahs established a decade on predictions in ungauged basins pub 2003 2012 and great progress has been achieved during this period hrachowitz et al 2013 regionalization is defined as the method for predicting runoff in ungauged basins by transferring information from gauged donor to ungauged target catchments e g rojas serna et al 2016 razavi and coulibaly 2013 in general regionalization methods are classified into three categories a spatial proximity methods assume that geographically close catchments have similar hydrological behaviors e g egbuniwe and todd 1976 vandewiele et al 1991 b physical similarity methods assume that catchments with similar physical characteristics have the same hydrological response e g burn and boorman 1993 mcintyre et al 2005 thus the parameter values are transferred to ungauged basins from either geographically close or physically similar gauged basins and c the regression method which is one of the most popular and oldest regionalization approaches oudin et al 2008 links model parameters to physical and climatic catchment characteristics by regression functions and assumes that the relationship is transferable from gauged to ungauged basins e g magette et al 1976 young 2006 many studies have applied and compared regionalization methods for various regions in combination with a wide range of hydrological models however in many cases the conclusion about which method performed best differs largely among the studies for example merz and blöschl 2004 concluded that the spatial proximity method performed better than the regression method for catchments in austria using the hbv model on the other hand young 2006 found that the regression method gave better results than the spatial proximity method in the uk bao et al 2012 concluded that the physical similarity method was best by using the akaike information criterion aic on 55 catchments in china different models were applied for different regions in these studies and therefore many hydrologists claim that the performance of regionalization methods depends on the study area and the choice of hydrological model e g parajka et al 2013 reichl et al 2009 salinas et al 2013 samuel et al 2011 viglione et al 2013 most of the above mentioned studies only used one hydrological model in a specific region and conclusions cannot be drawn on how the model selection or study region affects the performance of the regionalization methods few studies have assessed the performance of regionalization methods using multiple models li and zhang 2017 used simhyd 10 model parameters and xaj 12 model parameters in australia and found consistent regionalization results for both models the same conclusion was drawn by li et al 2014 where gr4j 7 model parameters and simhyd 12 model parameters were applied in the southeast tibetan plateau furthermore petheram et al 2012 conducted a comparison by using five rainfall runoff models and concluded that the difference between hydrological models was negligible for runoff prediction in ungauged basins this conclusion was consistent with two other studies chiew 2010 viney et al 2009b which also included five hydrological models however none of these studies included a regression approach which provided very different results when used with either the gr4j 4 model parameters or topmo 6 model parameters model in the study of oudin et al 2008 who tested three kinds of regionalization methods using two hydrological models for 913 catchments in france either the number of regionalization methods or the number of models used in previous studies is still too small to draw a general conclusion in addition all these evaluations have been performed for relatively warm climate regions where the snow process is of limited importance thus a more comprehensive study is needed to investigate how regionalization performance differs with multiple hydrological models of different complexity for runoff prediction in ungauged basins especially for cold and seasonally snow covered regions furthermore climate is changing ipcc 2014 resulting in nonstationary relationships between rainfall and runoff zhang et al 2011 which makes the reliability of applying the conclusions made in a historical period into future application questionable thus for future runoff prediction in ungauged basins it is essential to investigate the transferability of the regionalization methods under changing climatic conditions e g broderick 2016 yang et al 2019 finally regionalization performances also vary between regions according to parajka et al 2013 who statistically summarized this conclusion from 34 regionalization studies however it cannot explicitly present the performance difference between regions for specifically selected regionalization methods because different hydrological models and regionalization methods were applied in the studies cited and summarized by parajka et al 2013 in this study we perform a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of five widely used regionalization methods see section 3 2 combined with four frequently used hydrological models gr4j 6 parameters wasmod 8 parameters hbv 13 parameters and xaj 17 parameters in regions with highly contrasting physiographic and climatic settings the evaluation is based on 86 catchments in norway belonging to three different climatic regions according to the köppen geiger classification kottek et al 2006 and under different climate conditions this is the first study that specifically addresses how the performance of the regionalization methods a depends on the selection of hydrological models b changes in different climate conditions i e when air temperature increases and c varies between different climate regions as defined by the köppen geiger classification 2 study area and data 2 1 study area our study catchments are located in norway which is situated in northern europe in the western and northern part of the scandinavian peninsula norway has a long and rugged coastline elevation spanning from sea level to 2469 m a sl and latitudes ranging from 58 to 71 n this results in highly variable hydroclimatological conditions across the study domain vormoor et al 2016 yang et al 2018 2019 in this study we used data from 86 nonoverlapping catchments distributed evenly throughout our study domain figure 1 these stations have continuous meteorological data and discharge data records with less than 40 missing values during the periods from 1980 to 1989 as well as 2006 to 2015 these two periods are used in this study the left panel map in figure 1 also displays the köppen geiger climate classification which is based on data from 1976 to 2000 kottek et al 2006 peel et al 2007 beck et al 2018 note that the original classification divided norway into five different climate groups however in two of these groups less than 10 catchments were located we therefore merged some of the groups resulting in the following three regions a oceanic climate containing 19 catchments b continental climate containing 52 catchments and c polar tundra climate containing 15 catchments 2 2 data for the hydrological simulations we used daily precipitation and temperature data acquired from the gridded senorge dataset with a resolution of 1 km produced by the norwegian meteorological institute tveito et al 2005 mohr 2009 jansson 2007 daily discharge data were obtained from the hydrometric observation network of the norwegian water resources and energy directorate nve to test the performance of the regionalization methods under varying climate conditions we analyzed the precipitation and temperature records for the period from 1980 to 2015 figure 2 for precipitation there is no clear trend whereas temperature increases throughout the study period for model calibration and verification we selected ten years at the start 1980 to 1989 and the end 2006 to 2015 of the whole period since these two periods show the largest difference in air temperature for the first period the average precipitation is 1932 mm year and the air temperature is 1 2 c for the second period the average precipitation is 2027 mm year and the air temperature is 2 6 c the right panels in figure 2 show the average monthly precipitation temperature and pardé coefficient ratio between the average monthly discharge and the mean annual runoff for the catchments in each climatic group the oceanic climate group is characterized by higher precipitation during autumn and winter and higher air temperature than that of the two remaining groups the watersheds in the oceanic climate group also show two peaks in runoff compare the pardé coefficient between the groups resulting from spring snowmelt and strong rainfall during autumn the continental climate group displays low seasonality for precipitation but high seasonal variations in temperature resulting in one peak runoff caused by snowmelt the climate characteristics for the polar tundra climate group are similar to those of the continental group but with lower temperature and the snowmelt induced peak in runoff occurs later table 1 shows the average annual and seasonal precipitation temperature and runoff for the three climate classes precipitation in the oceanic climate group is substantially larger than that in the other two groups which show rather similar precipitation amounts for temperature the oceanic climate group shows the highest values whereas the coldest temperatures are recorded in the polar tundra climate group in particular for the oceanic group precipitation increases from the calibration to verification period for the winter season but for the summer season the difference is small between the two periods for temperature the increase from the calibration to verification period is smallest in the oceanic region compared to the other regions the seasonal characteristics in runoff are similar to those of precipitation note that summer runoff decreases from the calibration to the verification period for all groups since there is no potential evapotranspiration ep data available in our study area which are needed as the input data for the hydrological models we applied the hargreaves equation hargreaves 1975 to calculate ep mm day which is recommended by shuttleworth 1993 and xu and singh 2002 1 e p 0 0023 r a t c 17 8 tr where r a is the extraterrestrial radiation for the location in mm day evaporation equivalent allen et al 1998 tc is the temperature c and tr is the daily temperature range c a set of catchment descriptors is needed for two of the regionalization methods namely the physical similarity and regression methods see table 2 these catchment descriptors were used in yang et al 2018 2019 similar catchment descriptors have been used in several studies for evaluating regionalization methods e g he et al 2011 mcintyre et al 2005 merz and blöschl 2004 3 methods 3 1 hydrological models four widely used conceptual rainfall runoff models running at a daily time step were selected for the analysis in this study and a snow module was included in the models since runoff in many of the catchments is strongly affected by the accumulation and melting of snow the number of model parameters varies from 6 to 17 between the models after adding the snow routine figure 3 shows the model structures and a description of the parameters is available in table 3 gr4j génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier is a model based on unit hydrograph principles with four free parameters perrin et al 2003 it has been widely used in regionalization studies worldwide such as in france oudin et al 2008 china li et al 2014 and australia zhang et al 2014 2016 we coupled the gr4j model with a degree day type snow module called cemaneige that was developed by valéry 2010 this snow module allows us to estimate snowmelt and simulate snowpack evolution using two additional parameters and the coupling of gr4j and cemaneige has been tested in other studies e g coron et al 2014 hublart et al 2015 wasmod the water and snow balance modelling system is a model with simple structure and has been validated in many different climate regions e g xu and singh 2002 li et al 2013 2015 widén nilsson et al 2007 xu and halldin 1997 for regionalization studies it has been applied in sweden xu 2003 denmark muller wohlfeil et al 2003 and norway yang et al 2018 2019 the version of wasmod used in this study has eight free parameters hbv hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning is a popular model used for runoff simulation in both gauged and ungauged basins for regionalization studies it has been applied in different climate regions such as austria e g merz and blöschl 2004 parajka et al 2005 sweden seibert and beven 2009 china jin et al 2009 canada samuel et al 2011 and the us pool et al 2017 in our study we followed the structure and formulas in the hbv light version seibert and vis 2012 which includes a snow routine soil moisture routine response function and routing routine in total this model has thirteen calibration parameters the xaj xin an jiang model was developed for humid regions in china by zhao et al 1980 1992 and has since become a widely used model in flood forecasting water resources assessment and climate change assessments the original model consists of modules for computing evapotranspiration runoff production runoff separation and flow routing it has also been applied in many regionalization studies e g zhang and chiew 2009 li et al 2009 2017 we implemented the structure shown in lin et al 2014 without the muskingum routing module because our catchments are rather small in size with steep slopes and therefore river flow routing is not an important process li et al 2014 however there is no snow module in xaj and therefore we coupled it with the cemaneige snow module see description of the gr4j model above this model system contains seventeen parameters in total 3 2 regionalization methods spatial proximity physical similarity and regression methods are commonly used in regionalization studies e g oudin et al 2008 petheram et al 2012 hrachowitz et al 2013 for spatial proximity and physical similarity methods which are classified as distance based regionalization methods according to he et al 2011 the model parameter values in ungauged catchments are transferred from gauged donor catchments for the regression method the model parameter values in ungauged catchments are determined by regression functions established using data from gauged basins the regression method in this study is principal component regression pcr which couples principal component analysis pca with the multiple linear regression method using pca a set of observations of possibly correlated catchment descriptors is converted into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components then the relationships among model parameters and selected catchment descriptors are established using multiple linear regression finally these functions are used for estimating model parameters in the ungauged catchments table 4 describes the equations and assumptions for the regionalization methods applied in this study for distance based regionalization methods i e spatial proximity and physical similarity two approaches are often used for transferring the model parameters from the gauged donor to the ungauged target catchments e g mcintyre et al 2005 oudin et al 2008 a for the so called parameter averaging option the model parameters from the donor catchments are first averaged and then used to run the model for the target catchment b for the so called output averaging option the model is first run using the parameter sets from the donor catchments i e basins with runoff where model calibration is possible on the target catchment and the outputs from the model are then averaged as a result there are five regionalization approaches used in this study as shown in table 5 for a more detailed description please see yang et al 2018 2019 3 3 performance evaluation 3 3 1 model calibration and verification in this study we applied a widely used objective function proposed by viney et al 2009a when calibrating the models this objective function is a weighted combination of the nash and sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 and a logarithmic penalty function based on the bias as follows 2 f n s e 5 l n 1 b i a s 2 5 where 3 nse 1 q sim q obs 2 q obs q obs 2 4 bias q sim q obs q obs qobs represents the observed runoff and qsim represents the simulated runoff f values can vary from to the optimal value of 1 this objective function can come close to maximizing nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse and minimizing the bias at the same time vaze et al 2010 for the calibration process we used a standard gradient based automatic optimization method lagarias et al 1998 implemented in the matlab software package fmincon function matlab r2016b the mathworks inc natick massachusetts united states the split sample test is commonly used for model verification aiming to show the model validity in different climate conditions e g coron et al 2012 xu 1999 klemeš 1986 in the current study we evaluate the model performance for 1980 1989 and 2006 2015 and the temperature and precipitation in the latter period are approximately 1 4 c and 5 higher than that in the first period 3 3 2 evaluation of regionalization methods we performed three different evaluations of the regionalization methods in the first evaluation the performance of the regionalization methods was tested for all models using data from the calibration period aiming to show the differences among the models in this step we applied a leave one out cross verification method as in many other studies e g yang et al 2018 mcintyre et al 2005 in the second analysis we repeated the same evaluation but for the warmer and wetter verification period this analysis thus tests the transferability of both the regionalization methods and hydrological models under climate change conditions e g broderick 2016 li et al 2012 in the final evaluation we summarize and discuss the performance of the regionalization methods for the three different climatic regions see section 2 1 since the climate is changing to be warmer in the future ipcc 2014 the following regionalization performance for different climate conditions is investigated from 1980 to 1989 calibration to 2006 2015 verification 3 3 3 evaluation criteria to investigate the performance from different aspects we applied four different criteria in this study the calibration function f eq 2 is the first selection since it considers both the goodness of fit and the water balance aspects between the simulated and observed runoff nse eq 3 is the second evaluation criterion which is the most commonly used criterion in hydrology to measure the fit of the hydrographs between the observed and simulated runoff and is relatively sensitive to high flow e g oudin et al 2008 pushpalatha et al 2012 zhang and chiew 2009 thus we included another criterion nselog which is based on the same formulation as nse but computed on logarithmic transformed flows and with more emphasis on low flow e g oudin et al 2008 pushpalatha et al 2012 finally the percentage of bias pbias eq 4 is applied to measure the average tendency of the simulation to be larger or smaller than the observed counterparts the range for f nse and nselog is 1 where 1 means the simulated runoff perfectly fits the observed runoff and less than 0 suggests that the model is no better than the observed mean value for pbias it varies between with the optimal value equal to 0 and worse performance for water balance simulation if the absolute pbias is larger 4 results 4 1 hydrological model performance in cross verification before evaluating both the hydrological models and the regionalization methods we first assessed the performance of the models by a split sample test figure 4 presents the cumulative density function cdf curves for all hydrological models over 86 catchments measured by f value during 1980 1989 and 2006 2015 for the first calibration period 1980 1989 the left panel in figure 4 the cdf curves from all the hydrological models stay close and xaj appears to be slightly better the average f value is approximately 0 75 for xaj 0 73 for wasmod 0 72 for hbv and 0 69 for gr4j in the verification period 2006 2015 the models perform differently meaning the temporal transferability varies between the hydrological models however the best performance is still produced by xaj whose mean f value is approximately 0 68 followed by wasmod 0 64 the hbv model shows the worst performance with a mean f value of approximately 0 61 and the highest degradation of performance between the calibration and verification periods the results in the right panel calibration in 2006 2015 and verification in 1980 1989 shows very similar characteristics to those in the left panel xaj produced the best performance for both the calibration and the verification periods following the rating classification from moriasi et al 2007 who labeled the performance as good if nse is larger than 0 65 and pbias is less than 15 the f values larger than 0 61 are considered good model performance considering the average aspect all mean f values for our split sample test are higher than 0 61 thus all hydrological models applied in the current study are classified as good performing models for runoff simulation for both calibration and verification periods table 6 gives the average model performance corresponding to the split sample test by using other assessment criteria first regarding the water balance aspect all models yield similarly good performance for both subperiods with pbias values smaller than 5 second the model performance measured by nse shows consistent findings with the results from the f value i e a the models show similar performance in the calibration period but perform differently in the verification period b xaj is considered the best performing model for both the calibration and the verification cases and c hbv shows the largest decline in performance from the calibration to the verification period this similarity between the results from the f value and nse can be explained by the small pbias for all the simulation results finally according to the results of nselog which is more sensitive to low flow the simple models gr4j and wasmod display higher values in the calibration period while wasmod and xaj show better performance in the verification period considering the performance loss from calibration to verification relatively larger degradation appears for the nselog than for the nse and pbias especially for the gr4j model 4 2 evaluation of regionalization methods 4 2 1 influence of the number of donor catchments on performance under stationary conditions figure 5 shows that the output averaging option gives better average performance than the parameter averaging option in both spatial proximity and physical similarity methods and for all the models except for the case of one donor catchment where both options provided the identical results as expected when considering the number of donor catchments the largest increase in performance typically occurs when changing from using one donor catchment to using two donor catchments with the parameter option for xaj as the only exception this is in line with earlier studies that the number of donor catchments typically affects the performance of distance based regionalization methods e g oudin et al 2008 yang et al 2018 however the number of donor catchments providing the best performance differs among the hydrological models and regionalization methods for instance for xaj two donor catchments give the best results for sp out whereas 8 donor catchments are needed for hbv to achieve the optimal performance finally the difference in performance between the output and parameter averaging options increases with the number of model parameters for example the difference in the average f value between the two options for the gr4j model was approximately 0 025 and increased to 0 075 for xaj thus when using a model with many parameters it is more important to use the output averaging option to achieve optimal performance for runoff simulations in ungauged basins the physical similarity methods require fewer donor catchments to achieve optimal performance for runoff simulations in ungauged basins compared to that for the spatial proximity methods table 7 on average the best performance by the physical similarity methods was produced by 3 donor catchments whereas the corresponding number for the spatial proximity methods was 8 it is also noteworthy that the parameter averaging option requires fewer donor catchments than the output averaging option for both the physical similarity and the spatial proximity methods therefore for practical applications it is highly recommended to analyze the relationship between the regionalization performance and the number of donor catchments to choose the best configuration to obtain the optimal results for each case 4 2 2 regionalization performance assessment for all catchments as discussed in section 2 2 figure 2 and table 1 the climate conditions especially air temperature differed between 1980 and 1989 and 2006 2015 this section presents the influence of climate conditions on regionalization performance when the models are calibrated in 1980 1989 the evaluation results presented here applied the optimized number of donor catchments for each method and model as shown in table 7 4 2 2 1 comparison of regionalization performance between hydrological models figure 6 shows the distribution of f values as split violin plots for the five regionalization methods and four hydrological models for both the calibration and verification periods foremost for all the hydrological models the regionalization methods applying the output averaging option sp out and phy out showed better performance than the parameter averaging option sp par and phy par and the regression method is the worst compare black dots with circles this ranking applies for both the calibration and the verification periods where the methods with output averaging options presented more negative skewed distributions and higher mode values than those of the other methods on the other hand for both periods the difference in the average performance between the regionalization methods is smaller for gr4j than for the other models this difference seems to increase with the number of model parameters and is thus largest for xaj for instance in the calibration period the range in the average f values between the regionalization methods equals 0 04 for gr4j and 0 09 for xaj finally from the calibration to verification period performances decreased for all the hydrological models and regionalization methods but to various extents measured by the decrease in the overall mean f values from the calibration solid line to verification dashed line period hbv and xaj displayed larger declines in performance than those of gr4j and wasmod figure7 compares the regionalization performance in terms of the average values of pbias nse and nselog for all catchments using four hydrological models in the calibration and verification periods appendix a presents the violin plot for the evaluation criteria over all the tested catchments regarding the water balance simulation all average values of pbias vary within 10 10 the smallest water balance error for regionalized runoff simulation varies with the hydrological models and regionalization methods in general sp out and phy out tend to yield smaller errors for water balance simulation than those of the other methods the nse results give similar findings as the f value first sp out and phy out methods perform best for all the hydrological models with all average nse values larger than 0 6 and pcr performs worst second the difference in nse between the regionalization methods increases with the growing number of parameters for the hydrological models for example the regionalization performance in the calibration period ranges within 0 57 0 61 for gr4j and 0 57 0 67 for xaj third relatively larger degradation of the average regionalization performance is found using the hbv and xaj models from the calibration to the verification period for the low flow evaluation the regionalization methods with the output average option sp out and phy out substantially outperform the other methods and the performance differences between the regionalization methods are more distinct for hbv and xaj furthermore the average performance of the regionalization methods is highly influenced by the hydrological models in this study wasmod and hbv produced the highest and lowest average nselog values for the regionalization methods respectively compared with the results from the nse and f values the evaluation by nselog presents a more recognizable performance difference between the regionalization methods and hydrological models as well as the difference between the two subperiods 4 2 2 2 comparison of performance between regionalization methods figure 8 compares the performance difference in terms of nse and nselog between the hydrological models for each regionalization method during the calibration and verification periods we omit the results of the f value and pbias in the following analysis due to high similarity between the results from the f value and nse see figure 6 and appendix a and small average pbias values see figure 7 according to the average nse values xaj is considered the best hydrological model for all the distance based regionalization methods and the second best model for pcr gr4j shows the best results for pcr but the difference in performance between the models the gray bars for pcr is smallest among the regionalization methods indicating that the hydrological models have relatively smaller influence on the regression method than on the distance based methods however this difference is enhanced from the calibration to the verification period indicating a larger influence of the hydrological model on future runoff predictions according to nselog wasmod shows the best performance for all the regionalization methods and for both periods in general a larger difference between the hydrological models appears for low flows indicated by nselog than for high flows indicated by nse 4 2 3 assessment of regionalization performance for different climatic regions the three climatic regions shown in figure 1 display very different runoff regimes particularly between the oceanic and the two remaining groups figure 2 for illustration purposes the dependence of the performance of the regionalization methods on the geographical regions as measured by nse is shown in figure 9 it is seen that the oceanic region presented generally better regionalization performance than that of the other two regions whose performance variation was smaller as well only four performance classes shown on the figure then some common characteristics are presented in all the regions first when considering the regionalization methods the output averaging option tended to give higher performance than all the other methods when focusing on the hydrological models xaj showed the best performance in most cases for both the calibration and verification periods otherwise none of the remaining models consistently showed better results than the other models for all climatic regions and regionalization methods finally gr4j produced the lowest variation in performance within the climatic regions between the regionalization methods in almost all cases from the calibration to verification period the highest ranking for xaj with sp out and phy out methods did not change 5 discussion 5 1 hydrological model performance according to the performance classification presented by moriasi et al 2007 the split sample test result in our study indicated that all the hydrological models were able to provide good simulations of runoff for both the calibration and the verification periods especially for the water balance simulation the mean values of pbias for all the studied models are smaller than 5 according to the evaluations in the calibration period based on the f value and nse in our study area xaj is the best performing model and the performance tends to decrease with a decrease in the number of parameters for the hydrological models this finding is in line with the statement that increasing the number of model parameters can lead to better performance during the calibration period e g perrin et al 2001 petheram et al 2012 parajka et al 2013 however the result in terms of low flow simulation evaluations by nselog did not support that statement for example wasmod outperformed xaj and hbv for both subperiods therefore further study is needed to assess the relationship between hydrological model complexity and performance in terms of low flow furthermore for the verification results the performances among the models varied substantially the degradation of performance is quite similar between the hydrological models evaluating by the f value and nse but distinct differences are shown in the nselog results it reminds us that specific criteria are needed for evaluation of hydrological models when the emphasis stands on low flow or draughts regarding the model performance change from the calibration to the verification period the model performance of the xaj model did not vary substantially this is incompatible with earlier findings which suggest that a complex model tends to have less stable performance than simple models in the verification period e g perrin et al 2001 holländer et al 2009 this phenomenon might relate to the model structure for instance the runoff concentration in the xaj model includes surface runoff interflow runoff and groundwater runoff with three parameters that may better represent the processes in our study catchments 5 2 evaluation of regionalization methods 5 2 1 influence of the number of donor catchments on performance to test the influence of the number of donor catchments on model performance we examined the relationship between regionalization performance and the number of donor catchments for all the models with distance based methods the results indicate that using one donor catchment which might be either the spatially nearest or physically most similar watershed gives worse results than using a set of donor catchments this conclusion is supported by all the tested models in our study which is in line with previous findings e g arsenault and brissette 2014 oudin et al 2008 multiple donor catchments typically provide more information than single donor catchments which may explain the behavior described above e g viney et al 2009b however the output averaging option might tend to smooth the flow variability as the number of donor catchments increases this is especially the case if the donors give models with different time lags between rainfall and peak flow therefore the smoothing effect and trade off between the benefits of gains in performance with more information and loss of performance due to this possible smoothing is worth further investigation in future studies our results additionally confirmed that the output averaging option provided better performance than the parameter averaging option in all the model and method combinations e g oudin et al 2008 bao et al 2012 yang et al 2018 since we applied hydrological models with different complexities and number of parameters a promising and new finding is presented in this study the difference in performance between the parameter averaging and output averaging options increases with the number of model parameters see figure 5 first this result can be explained by the nonlinear independence influence between model parameters thus transferring the linearly interpolated individual model parameter value the parameter averaging option will lead to unreasonable model parameters and results bárdossy 2007 second hydrological models with more parameters tend to increase the interaction between their parameters e g perrin et al 2003 poissant et al 2017 hence we should consider the model parameters as a whole set rather than individual values for regionalization research as suggested by bárdossy 2007 and oudin et al 2008 some previous studies used one donor catchment for regionalization evaluation according to spatial or physical similarity and concluded that the difference in performance between hydrological models is negligible e g viney et al 2009b chiew 2010 petheram et al 2012 however in the current study xaj produced distinct results from the other models see figure 5 results with 1 donor catchment which suggests that the performance of regionalization methods is affected by the choice of hydrological models even with one donor catchment 5 2 2 assessment over hydrological models although we claimed that the methods with the output averaging option sp out and phy out produced better performance than the other methods it is difficult to determine the most appropriate method between the spatial proximity sp out and physical similarity phy out methods also valid for excluding the influence on the hydrological model performance of calibration and verification see appendix b this is consistent with the evaluation by using one hydrological model monthly wasmod in the same area by yang et al 2018 according to the explanation from oudin et al 2008 it is not possible to decide which approach sp out or phy out is the most appropriate one when the streaming network density is lower than 60 stations per 100 000 km2 as we used four hydrological models at different complexity levels this result additionally confirmed that this assertion is independent of the selection of hydrological models investigating the model preference for regionalization methods from different aspects xaj should be preferred when the evaluation is more focused on high flow while wasmod should be considered for low flow analysis this result is consistent with the model performance for gauged catchments see figure 4 and table 6 this result tends to support the claim that there is no incentive to prefer a parsimonious hydrological model for regionalization studies rather than a model with adequate complexity arsenault et al 2015 poissant et al 2017 however hydrological models with fewer parameters are recommended when no preknowledge about the regionalization performance is available since the performance difference between the regionalization methods is relatively smaller for the regression method the model with more parameters works worse probably due to the stronger interaction influence when increasing the number of parameters e g perrin et al 2003 poissant et al 2017 another limitation of the regression method is that not all the functions for the model parameters follow the linear assumption e g blöschl 2005 and poor performance results from the accumulated errors 5 2 3 assessment in different climatic regions according to both the nse and nselog results sp out and phy out perform best for all the climatic regions therefore it seems reasonable to conclude that the selection of the climatic region has no large effect on the ranking of regionalization methods however the average regionalization performance in the oceanic climate region is substantially better and varies within a smaller range than in the other two cold regions this indicates that the uncertainty in the selection of regionalization methods is larger in cold and dry regions than in warm and wet regions see figure 2 due to the limited number of catchments in the oceanic climate and polar tundra climate regions further comprehensive studies are needed to conclude the preferences of hydrological models and regionalization methods over various regions 6 conclusions the main aim of this study was to investigate how different combinations of regionalization methods hydrological models and climate conditions will influence the overall performance of hydrological simulations in ungauged basins we assessed the performance of four hydrological models and five regionalization schemes a under stationary climate conditions to test how the performance of the regionalization methods depends on the choice of hydrological models b under different climate conditions to assess the stability in performance of the hydrological models and regionalization methods as climate changes and c in different climatic regions to test how the performances of the simulations vary between these regions the study was performed using data from 86 catchments in norway covering three climatic groups according to the köppen geiger classification in this study we found that for all the hydrological models the distance based approaches with the output averaging option sp out and phy out always outperformed the other tested methods especially for the low flow estimation second the difference in performance between the output and parameter averaging options is not stable and positively increases with the number of parameters for the hydrological models from our study the performance difference between these options is the largest for xaj and the smallest for gr4j third the performance difference among the regionalization methods was smaller for models with fewer parameters gr4j and wasmod compared to that of the models with more tunable parameters hbv and xaj regarding the model influence on regionalization performance xaj is recommended as the best performing model according to the evaluations by nse and f values whereas nselog recommends wasmod as the best through the evaluation furthermore clear differences in general were displayed for three climatic regions and oceanic climatic regions provided the best performance and smallest variance over the regionalization methods and hydrological models moreover the difference in hydrological model performance seems smaller among the regionalization methods than among the climate regions from calibration to verification periods the general performance for the regionalization methods did not show large degradations although this study produced some solid conclusions that were not available before there are some limitations of the current study compared with the general evaluation of hydrograph fit and water balance assessment with emphasis on low flow showed more contrasting results which requires closer attention in future work in addition studies with more different hydrological models are needed to show the influence of hydrological model selection on regionalization performance moreover studies with more contrast in climate conditions are recommended to investigate the transferability of conclusions across climate regions and climate changing conditions which is
