11475,this work was mainly aimed at studying the spatio temporal distribution of water content θw bulk eca and soil solution ecss electrical conductivity measured with a dielectric sensor gs3 and a tension lysimeter suction cup throughout three drip irrigated tomato crops in mediterranean greenhouses the mean θw gs3 for the wet bulb was well estimated by measuring at representative positions especially at the centre of the wet bulb the ecss substantially increased in the wet bulb irrespective of the soil position reaching relatively high values 6 7 ds m 1 in the second half of the cycles mostly due to sodium and chloride accumulation the mean ecss for the wet bulb was narrowly and linearly related to that measured at any of four representative positions in the wet bulb which presented similar seasonal dynamics and absolute values throughout most of the crops the mean ecss for the wet bulb can be well estimated by measuring at one of these positions since the errors of using measurements from these positions were relatively low the relationship between the ecss estimated from gs3 and that measured with suction cup varied depending mostly on soil position and cropping year but the gs3 did not generally provide accurate ecss estimates especially in the second half of the cycles when salts accumulated in the soil despite this measurements of eca and ecss from gs3 at the centre of the wet bulb might be useful for identifying tendencies or relevant salinity changes for automated irrigation systems the solution concentration for main salts and nutrients can be fairly well monitored by sampling at any of the four representative positions of the wet bulb however it appears advisable to measure at the centre of the wet bulb as samples from this position might respond faster to changes in the nutrient solution supply or the root activity especially for very mobile elements such as nitrate keywords bulk and solution electrical conductivity dielectric permittivity gs3 soil matric potential salinity suction cup 1 introduction in heavily fertigated intensive agricultural systems such as mediterranean greenhouses feasible soil monitoring protocols are needed for optimising crop irrigation and fertilization and especially for minimising soil and water pollution this is particularly relevant in irrigation areas with scarce water resources of low or medium quality such as the se spanish mediterranean coast in this area the groundwater the main irrigation source has been vastly overexploited and presents increasing problems of nitrate contamination and salinization casas et al 2015 but most greenhouse farmers still continue using irrigation and fertigation practices based on their experiences thompson et al 2007b without monitoring or controlling the soil water nutrient and salt status a representative monitoring of the soil solute content in agricultural soils requires a thorough knowledge of the soil spatial distribution of water nutrients and salts throughout the crop cycles especially in intensive drip irrigated crops several lysimetry methods have been introduced for nutrient and salt soil monitoring and the suction cup sampler is the most common one in spanish mediterranean greenhouse crops cabrera corral et al 2016 de pascale et al 2017 in this area there has been appreciable experimental work in recent years with the use of suction cup samplers and extension materials with protocols for their use have been developed de pascale et al 2017 this method which extracts the soil solution with a low cost tension lysimeter is effective in greenhouse soils usually maintained moist at soil matric potentials close to field capacity and appears to represent well the soil concentration of the available elements especially under unsaturated flow conditions cabrera corral et al 2016 additionally an increasing number of dielectric sensors are being developed for continuous measurement of the water content θw and the apparent or bulk electrical conductivity eca of soils for agricultural and environmental purposes some of these sensors can also estimate the electrical conductivity of the pore a variable closely related to the soil salinity in contact with plant roots or the electrical conductivity of soil solution ecss the eca i e the ec of the soil water and air complex is influenced by several physical and chemical soil properties such as salinity saturation percentage water content bulk density and temperature it usually increases with water content and the slope of this relationship depends on the level of salinity the higher the salinity the steeper the slope amente et al 2000 moret fernández et al 2012 these authors also observed that the eca at a constant θw was linearly related to the ecss showing steeper slopes at higher θw values incrocci et al 2009 also found that the eca of horticultural substrates was best related to the ecss at high θw values moreover valdés et al 2014 found that although the eca is not a true reading of the soil solution salinity it is a closely related parameter which can be regarded as a useful tool for mitigating the negative effects of saline conditions in the production of potted ornamental plants thus when the ecss cannot be measured directly or estimated accurately the eca appears to be a reliable variable for evaluating soil salinity in crop media usually maintained at high water contents the ecss can be measured periodically in soil solution samples extracted with suction cup or estimated continually with empirical calibration equations or physical based models using eca and θw measurements hendrickx et al 2002 several models of varying complexity have been developed to determine the ecss from dielectric sensor measurements amente et al 2000 hilhorst 2000 incrocci et al 2009 moret fernández et al 2012 e g gs3 and wet sensors estimate the ecss with the expression developed by hilhorst 2000 however there are a variety of factors such as soil solution salinity or soil type which can influence the output of these sensors and their estimation methods malicki and walczak 1999 visconti et al 2014 though the use of dielectric sensors for continuous monitoring of θw eca and ecss in agricultural soils appears to be promising further work and testing is required to improve their accuracy and applicability in the field especially in intensive systems under saline soil conditions this work was mainly aimed at i studying the spatio temporal distribution of water content bulk and soil solution electrical conductivity measurements with a dielectric sensor gs3 and a tension lysimeter suction cup throughout drip irrigated greenhouse tomato crops ii assessing the reliability of bulk electrical and soil solution conductivity measurements using gs3 to monitor soil salinity status 2 material and methods 2 1 site and experiment experiments were carried out in parral types greenhouses 24 m 18 m located at las palmerillas cajamar foundation 2 43 w 36 4 n 155 m a s l on the almería coast se spain the greenhouses were low cost structures covered with plastic film and with layered soils known as enarenado and of widespread use in the region wittwer and castilla 1995 a first tomato crop solanum lycopersicum l cv genio was grown from 3 february to 6 july 2015 the soil consisted of the naturally occurring gravelly sandy loam soil covered with a 0 4 m layer of imported silty clay loam soil a 0 02 m layer of dried manure and an upper 0 1 m mulch layer of coarse sand and fine gravel particles with time and use the manure layer was practically mineralised and disappeared and the 0 1 m upper part of the imported soil layer was mixed with sand and gravel particles from the top layer the upper limit of drained water content field capacity for the imported silty clay loam layer was 0 37 m3 m 3 and the lower limit wilting point was 0 14 m3 m 3 the total amount of irrigation water supplied was 348 mm 12 mm applied before planting and irrigation was applied daily except at the beginning of the cycle february the estimated seasonal crop evapotranspiration was 307 mm this tomato crop was subjected to five irrigation strategies in order to obtain a wide and representative range of water and salt soil conditions strategy 1 s1 25 02 29 03 2015 irrigation rates slightly lower than the crop water requirements short irrigations of about 0 67 mm with water of about 1 7 ds m 1 ec or with nutrient solution of 2 5 ds m 1 ec to enhance crop rooting strategy 2 s2 30 03 23 04 irrigation rates about 30 higher than the crop water requirements long irrigation events with a nutrient solution of about 2 5 ds m 1 ec to increase soil water availability strategy 3 s3 24 04 21 05 short irrigation events of 0 67 mm with a nutrient solution of about 2 ds m 1 ec supplied automatically when the soil matric potential was lower than 20 kpa at two of the three digital tensiometers or than 30 kpa at one tensiometer strategy 4 s4 22 05 14 06 irrigation rates about 30 higher than the crop water requirements long irrigation events with a nutrient solution of about 2 0 ds m 1 ec for salt leaching strategy 5 s5 15 06 06 07 short irrigation events of about 0 67 mm with a nutrient solution of about 2 5 ds m 1 ec supplied when the θw at 0 35 m depth below the emitter and plant was below 0 35 m3 m 3 at two of the three gs3 sensors or below 0 33 m3 m 3 at one gs3 at the end of this strategy the threshold θw values increased to 0 38 m3 m 3 at two of the sensors and to 0 36 m3 m 3 at one a second cv valkiria and third cv ateneo tomato crop were also grown from 3 february to 29 june 2016 and from 13 september 2016 to 24 may 2017 respectively in a similar parral type greenhouse 24 m 18 m the enarenado soil was of similar textural characteristics to that used in the previous season but only about 0 05 m upper part of the imported soil layer was mixed with sand and gravel particles from the top layer irrigation water of 1 5 1 7 ds m 1 ec table 1 mixed with fertilizers was applied through a surface drip system with over 90 distribution uniformity emitters one per plant of 3 1 l h 1 2015

methodology adapted to mediterranean greenhouses bonachela et al 2006 fernández et al 2010 orgaz et al 2005 before each crop cycle the greenhouse was irrigated abundantly to wet the soil and especially to leach the salts accumulated over the previous cropping year thompson et al 2007b the external surface of the plastic greenhouses was whitewashed throughout the spring to avoid excessive greenhouse air temperatures 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 soil solution sampling in the 2015 tomato cycle 12 suction cups model ssat irrometer riverside ca usa sc were installed randomly before crop planting at four soil positions three repetitions per position in the silty clay loam layer fig 1 six were installed at 0 02 0 05 m from emitter and plant three in the middle at 0 35 m depth a35 and the other three in the lower part at 0 45 m depth a45 of the silty clay loam layer six were installed at 0 25 m from the emitter in the middle of silty clay loam layer at 0 35 m depth three perpendicular to the drip line br35 and three between two contiguous emitters below the drip line be35 in the 2016 and 2016 17 tomato cycles 12 suction cups three per position were also installed at a35 a45 be35 and br35 every two three weeks a suction of about 50 60 kpa was applied to each suction cup four hours after irrigation and the soil solution was collected early the following day and stored at 4 c before use the cups were cleaned by rinsing with hydrochloric acid and deionized water weihermüller et al 2007 the electrical conductivity of the soil solution ecss ds m 1 was measured with a conductivimeter basic model 30 crison instruments sa barcelona spain concentration of the main soil nutrients nitrate potassium calcium magnesium sodium chloride and sulphate was measured throughout the 2015 cycle using standard laboratory methods mapa 1994 at most sampling dates the concentration of nitrate potassium calcium and sodium was also measured with laqua twin no3 k ca2 and na sensors horiba instruments inc ca usa respectively at all the sampling dates throughout the three tomato cycles strong linear relationships between laqua sensors and laboratory measurements were found for nitrate potassium calcium and sodium and the errors of using these rapid analysis methods were relatively low cabrera corral et al 2016 these relationships were applied to correct laqua data for the sampling dates when laboratory measurements were not conducted 2 2 2 soil water potential the soil matric potential ψm was continuously measured in the centre of the wet soil bulb a35 with three digital tensiometers model isrrsu 300 irrometer 2 2 3 soil water content and bulk electrical conductivity soil bulk dielectric permittivity εa unitless temperature c and bulk electrical conductivity eca ds m

installed before planting december 2014 at eight representative soil positions three per position fig 1 at a35 a45 be35 and br35 at 0 45 m depth and 0 25 m from the emitter perpendicular to the drip line br45 and between two contiguous emitters below the drip line be45 in the upper part of the gravelly sandy loam layer at 0 55 m depth and 0 02 0 05 m from emitter and plant a55 and at 0 35 m depth and 0 5 m from the emitter perpendicular to the drip line c35 during the 2016 and 2016 17 tomato cycles six gs3 sensors installed before planting december 2015 at the two more representative positions in the silty clay loam layer three at a35 and three at be35 fig 1 were monitored at each position the volumetric soil water content θw m3 m 3 was determined from εa values using the default calibration supplied by the manufacturer and the pore water or soil solution electrical conductivity ecss ds m 1 was estimated with eq 1 hilhorst 2000 1 ecss εw eca εa εeca 0 where εa is the real portion of the electrical permittivity of the bulk soil εeca 0 is the real portion of the dielectric permittivity of the bulk soil when eca 0 6 0 for this soil and εw is the real portion of the electrical permittivity of the soil pore water which was calculated from soil temperature ts c with eq 2 2 εw 80 3 0 37 ts 20 a dataset of this work is deposited in mandeley data repository doi 10 17632 hsncnbwv2f 1 3 results 3 1 soil matric potential water content and bulk electrical conductivity for a wide range of irrigation conditions throughout the 2015 crop the seasonal evolution of the mean daily values of the soil water content θw and the soil bulk electrical conductivity eca at different soil depths pooling data from all the positions at the same depth in the soil wetted by the emitters or wet bulb and at the most representative positions within the wet bulb are shown by figs 2 and 3 respectively the irrigation water generally reached all the measured positions throughout most of the 2015 tomato cycle figs 2 and 3 except the soil located 0 5 m perpendicular to the drip line in the middle of the silty clay loam layer c35 the θw at this position was steady throughout most of the cycle and presented values substantially lower than those measured at the other positions in the silty clay loam layer fig 2 which indicates that the irrigation water front did not usually reach this position therefore considering the measurement volume sensed by the gs3 decagon devices 2016 the emitters wetted the silty clay loam layer to about 0 30 m on both sides of the drip line wet bulb in general rather similar dynamics were observed for the θw and the eca at the measured positions in the wet soil bulb throughout most of the 2015 tomato crop figs 2 and 3 at the beginning of the cycle the crop was slightly under irrigated to enhance root growth and crop establishment s1 which reduced progressively the ψm in the middle of the silty clay loam soil layer below the emitter and plant a35 and the mean θw and the mean eca in the middle 0 35 m depth and at the bottom 0 45 m depth of the wet silty clay loam layer fig 2 the automatic application of short irrigations to keep the ψm above 20 or 30 kpa s3 maintained relatively steady the θw and the eca at a35 and at a45 and in the upper part of the gravelly sandy loam soil layer at 0 55 m depth a55 however this irrigation strategy increased substantially the θw and especially the eca at be35 the soil position between two contiguous emitters in the middle of the wet silty clay loam layer the application of long irrigations events with irrigation rates higher than the tomato water requirements increased substantially s2 or maintained high s4 the ψm at a35 and the mean values of θw and eca in the middle and at the bottom of the wet silty clay loam layer fig 2 this strategy also increased the θw at a55 in both scenarios and reduced the θw and the eca at be35 during s4 finally the application of short irrigations to keep the θw above a threshold value of 35 m3 m 3 at a35 s5 resulted in irrigation rates lower than the tomato water requirements which decreased substantially the ψm at a35 and to a much lesser extent the θw in the middle and lower parts of the wet silty clay loam layer and in the upper part of the gravelly sandy loam soil layer this strategy also increased the eca at a35 and be35 moreover when the threshold of θw was raised to 38 m3 m 3 at the end of this scenario the ψm drastically increased to values above 20 kpa and the θw and the eca substantially increased at all the measured positions figs 2 and 3 the θw in the middle pooling measurements at 0 35 m depth of the wet silty clay loam layer was relatively similar to that in the lower part of this layer pooling data at 0 45 m depth throughout the 2015 tomato cycle irrespective of the irrigation scenario fig 2 the seasonal θw dynamics was also generally similar at the more representative soil positions of the wet silty clay loam layer fig 3 while there were differences in the absolute values between some positions especially at be35 and br35 the positions located between two contiguous emitters and further from the emitter line respectively in the middle of the wet silty clay loam layer fig 3 in the linear regression analysis fig 4 and table 2 good fits were observed between the θw at a35 and a45 and the mean θw for the whole wet silty clay loam layer and the errors of using measurements at a35 and a45 for estimating the mean θw in the wet silty clay loam layer were low table 2 the rmse and the mean absolute error mae were lower than 0 01 m3 m 3 for both positions the eca in the middle pooling data at 0 35 m depth of the wet silty clay loam layer was also similar to that measured in the lower part of this soil layer throughout the 2015 tomato cycle regardless of the irrigation scenario fig 2 the seasonal dynamics of the eca was also rather similar at the more representative soil positions in the wet silty clay loam layer fig 3 but there were differences in the absolute values between some positions especially at br35 in the linear regression analysis good fits were observed between the eca at a35 a45 and be35 and the mean eca for the wet silty clay loam layer fig 4 and table 2 although measurements from these positions tended to underestimate the mean eca in the wet silty clay loam layer fig 4 for be35 the rmse was 0 08 ds m 1 and the mae was 0 07 ds m 1 for a35 the rmse was 0 11 ds m 1 and the mae was 0 10 ds m 1 and for a45 the rmse and the mae were 0 11 ds m 1 table 2 the seasonal dynamics of the mean daily eca appears to be similar to that of the mean daily θw in the middle and in the lower part of the wet silty clay loam layer throughout most of the 2015 tomato cycle fig 2 the linear regression analysis showed that the mean daily eca in the wet silty clay loam layer was narrowly and linearly related to the mean daily θw especially when data from the first scenario s1 were separated from the other scenarios fig 4 eca ds m 1 3 69θw m3 m 3 0 51 r2 0 99 over the whole 2015 tomato cycle the average standard deviation of the mean daily θw among gs3 sensors located in the same position varied depending on the soil position reaching values of 0 05 m3 m 3 table 3 the average standard deviation of the mean daily eca behaved similarly table 3 reaching even higher values in some positions up to 0 24 ds m 1 3 2 soil solution electrical conductivity the soil spatial distribution throughout the 2015 tomato crop of the ecss measured in solution samples collected with suction cup at four representative positions in the wet silty clay loam layer is shown in fig 5 the ecss at the beginning of the cycle when the crop was slightly under irrigated s1 maintained relatively steady and was similar for the four positions later the crop was over irrigated s2 and the ecss substantially increased for all the positions reaching values between 6 and 7 ds m 1 at end of this scenario then the automatic application of short irrigations to ensure a high ψm s3 maintained or increased the ecss higher values were found for the positions located further from emitters at be35 and br35 although there were no significant differences between positions hereafter the crop was over irrigated with long irrigation events s4 which reduced the ecss at most positions especially those located further from emitters finally the ecss increased at all the positions at the end of the last scenario s5 when the crop was first under irrigated and later over irrigated by applying short irrigations to keep the swc above various set points overall considering the whole 2015 tomato cycle the mean seasonal ecss was slightly but significantly lower at a35 5 4 ds m 1 than at a45 5 8 ds m 1 br35 6 1 ds m 1 and be35 5 9 ds m 1 in general the seasonal ecss dynamics was similar at the four measured positions throughout most of the 2015 fig 5 2016 and 2016 17 tomato cycles data not shown overall considering the three cycles good linear regression fits were found between the ecss measured at a45 br35 and especially at a35 and be35 and the mean ecss for the whole wet silty clay loam layer fig 5 moreover the errors of using data from these positions for estimating the mean ecss for the wet silty clay loam layer were low table 4 the rmse varied between 0 3 and 0 5 ds m 1 and the mae between 0 2 and 0 4 ds m 1 the ecss from suction cup was related to the eca measured with gs3 at two representative positions in the wet silty clay loam layer throughout the three tomato cycles fig 4 pooling data from both positions in the three crops the regression analysis presented a moderate fit r2 0 67 between both variables which were related by a polynomic curve the ecss measured in solution samples extracted with suction cups was compared to that estimated from gs3 data at representative positions in the wet silty clay loam layer throughout the three tomato cycles fig 6 in the first crop the seasonal ecss dynamics was similar for both methods at a45 and especially at a35 but not for the whole tomato cycle while it substantially differed between methods at the two other positions e g the ecss from gs3 at br35 hardly changed during the cycle while that from the suction cup presented substantial changes moreover the ecss from gs3 was usually lower than that from the suction cup at all the positions during the second half of this tomato cycle with significant differences for some sampling dates at be35 and especially at a45 and br35 overall the mean seasonal ecss estimated from gs3 was significantly lower than that measured in the suction cup at a35 and a45 table 4 in the second tomato crop similar ecss dynamics was observed for both methods at a35 fig 6 and be35 data not shown but the ecss from gs3 was usually lower than that from the suction cup during the second half of the cycle at both positions finally the seasonal dynamics and the absolute values of ecss at a35 were rather similar for both methods throughout most of the 2016 17 cycle fig 6 although ecss values from gs3 were slightly lower during the second half of the crop overall the mean seasonal ecss estimated from gs3 measurements was significantly lower than that measured in the suction cup at a35 and be35 in the 2016 crop but no significant differences were found between methods in the 2016 17 crop table 4 for the 2015 tomato crop the average standard deviation of the mean daily ecss reached relatively high values in some soil positions table 3 ranging between 0 26 and 1 43 ds m 1 for estimated gs3 values and between 0 54 and 0 82 ds m 1 for measured suction cup values 3 3 soil solution nutrient and salt concentration the concentrations of potassium calcium and sodium increased throughout most of the 2015 tomato cycle especially sodium figs 5 and 7 the seasonal concentration dynamics of these elements was rather similar at the four positions throughout most of this tomato cycle figs 5 and 7 although the absolute values of sodium were usually lower at a35 than at the other positions similar responses were found for the concentrations of magnesium chloride and sulphate data not shown when the sodium potassium or calcium concentrations from the three tomato cycles were assessed together using linear regression analysis good to moderate fits were found between the concentration of these elements at each of the four measured positions and the mean concentration for the whole wet silty clay loam layer figs 5 and 7 table 5 the errors of using measurements from these positions for estimating the mean concentration in the wet silty clay loam layer were generally low to moderate depending on the position and element in general the a35 position presented lower concentration values for sodium and more variable concentration values for potassium and calcium the nitrate concentration in the soil solution decreased throughout most of the 2015 tomato cycle at the four representative positions of the wet silty clay loam layer fig 7 this concentration was generally around or below that of the supplied nutrient solution but it reached values close to zero at the end of the period when the crop was over irrigated with long irrigation events to reduce salt accumulation s4 the seasonal dynamics of nitrate concentration was rather similar at the four measured positions except at the end of the crop when it was significantly higher at a35 fig 7 moreover when the three tomato cycles were assessed together the linear regression analysis between the nitrate concentration at each of the four measured positions and the mean value for the wet silty clay loam layer fig 7 presented moderate fits table 5 especially at a35 which showed the lowest and the highest nitrate concentration values the errors of using data from these four positions for estimating the mean nitrate concentration for the wet silty clay loam layer were relatively higher than those found for the other elements especially at a35 table 5 the rmse ranged between 1 4 and 2 7 mmol l 1 and the mae varied between 1 0 and 1 6 mmol l 1 4 discussion the spatio temporal distribution of θw eca and ecss was assessed in depth using dielectric gs3 and lysimetry suction cup methods throughout drip irrigated greenhouse tomato crops the emitters wetted the silty clay loam soil layer to about 0 30 m from both sides of the drip line throughout most of the 2015 crop cycle fig 2 a similar soil volume was wetted by the emitters in a cucumber crop grown in a mediterranean greenhouse with an enarenado soil gonzález 2003 this wet layer or bulb usually concentrates most roots and water and nutrient uptake of fruit vegetable crops in mediterranean greenhouses gonzález 2003 padilla et al 2017 the seasonal dynamics and the absolute values of the mean daily θw in the middle of the wet layer or bulb pooling measurements at 0 35 m depth were similar to those found in the lower part of this layer throughout most of the 2015 tomato cycle fig 2 moreover the mean daily θw for the whole wet bulb layer was narrowly and linearly related to the θw measured at some representative positions fig 4 the mean daily θw for the wet bulb was correctly estimated by measuring at a45 and especially at a35 fig 4 since the errors of using measurements from these two positions were low and below the accuracy of soil water content sensors table 2 the measurement at a35 the position located in the centre of the wet bulb fig 1 appears to be the best position for estimating the mean daily θw in the wet bulb fig 4 table 2 although other representative positions can also provide good predictions the variability of the mean daily θw among sensors located in the same position was relatively high at some soil positions table 3 the average standard deviation of the mean daily θw for the 2015 tomato crop reached values of 0 05 m3 m 3 at some positions this relatively high θw variability might be explained at least partially by heterogeneity in soil properties and water relations inherent or induced by sensor installation presence of gravel or larger particles soil density air gaps etc and other variability sources evett et al 2007 as well as by the relatively small soil volume sensed by the gs3 decagon devices 2016 this phenomenon which is common in dielectric devices sensing small soil volumes might also explain some of the θw differences observed between soil positions in the wet bulb such as the lower absolute θw values found at be35 fig 3 on the other hand the ψm measured with tensiometer at a35 was generally more sensitive to changes in soil water status than the θw measured with gs3 especially during the s5 strategy figs 2 and 3 in this period the ψm decreased substantially while the θw decreased only slightly the high soil salinity level found in this period about 6 ds m 1 or higher fig 5 might have affected θw measurements with gs3 bitelli 2011 pardossi et al 2009 visconti et al 2014 in conclusion when monitoring the soil water status in soil grown mediterranean greenhouse crops with dielectric sensors such as the gs3 it appears advisable to i locate the gs3 in the centre of the wet bulb below the emitter ii work with relative θw values in order to minimize data variability among sensors located in the same position iii define a comfort θw range i e the threshold value of available soil water content thompson et al 2007a based on ψm measurements at the beginning of the crop cycle and iv redefine this comfort θw range if soil salinity or other relevant conditions change substantially during the crop cycle additionally an extra dielectric sensor might be located in the upper part of the gravelly sandy loam layer at a55 so as to minimize or control over irrigation the seasonal dynamics and the absolute values of the mean daily eca in the middle part of the wet bulb were also similar to those measured in the lower part of this layer throughout most of the 2015 tomato cycle fig 2 the mean daily eca for the wet bulb was also narrowly and linearly related to the eca measured at some representative positions e g at a35 a45 and be35 fig 4 but the errors of using measurements from these positions for estimating the mean eca in the wet bulb were relatively higher than those found for θw table 2 moreover the mean daily values of the eca in the wet bulb were linearly related to the corresponding mean daily θw values fig 4 but the slope of this relationship changed with the level of soil salinity as observed in previous works amente et al 2000 moret fernández et al 2012 the slope of this relationship was steeper for measurements from scenarios s2 to s5 than for those taken at the beginning of the tomato cycle s1 when the salinity in the wet bulb was substantially lower fig 4 greenhouse farmers from the se spanish mediterranean coast usually irrigate abundantly in summer during the period without crop to wet the soil and especially to leach the salts accumulated over the previous cropping year thompson et al 2007b however this irrigation practice may not suffice to control the soil salinity the following crop cycle if moderate brackish or saline waters are used for irrigation as frequently occurs in this area where the groundwater the main agricultural water source is becoming increasingly salinized due to seawater intrusion throughout most of the 2015 tomato cycle the ecss substantially increased in the wet bulb regardless of the soil position fig 5 reaching relatively high values of about 6 7 ds m 1 these values appear to be above those considered optimum for greenhouse tomato production maas and hoffman 1977 sonneveld and vogt 2009 the ecss increment was mostly due to the accumulation of sodium and chloride in the wet bulb fig 5 which were abundantly supplied in the irrigation water table 1 and are scarcely absorbed by the tomato crop sonneveld and vogt 2009 the mean solution concentration of these elements for the wet bulb reached values of 31 5 mmol l 1 for sodium and 59 6 mmol l 1 for chloride at the end of 2015 tomato cycle these concentrations may also induce specific salinity effects toxicity or nutrient disturbance but no symptoms were detected throughout this cycle in order to reduce excessive soil salinity levels some greenhouse tomato growers from this area over irrigate their crops although this practice has not been well documented in the 2015 tomato cycle the effectiveness of over irrigating varied depending on the water and salinity status of the soil over irrigating after a mild soil drying period with relatively low soil salinity levels s2 substantially increased the soil content of water salts and some nutrients at all the positions of the wet bulb figs 3 5 7 at relatively low soil salinity levels in the wet bulb s2 the rate of soil salinization mostly depends on the amount of saline water applied meiri 1984 shalhevet 1994 on the other hand over irrigating when the soil content of water and solutes in the wet bulb was high s4 reduced the concentration of salts and some nutrients figs 5 and 7 therefore the leaching fraction should be applied once the salt accumulation in the root environment reaches hazardous levels meiri 1984 shalhevet 1994 e g for mediterranean greenhouse tomato crops it should be applied over the spring period when the soil salinity has usually reached high values fig 5 and the evaporative demand increases fernández et al 2010 the seasonal dynamics and the absolute values of ecss were relatively similar at the four representative positions in the wet bulb throughout most of the 2015 tomato cycle fig 5 although absolute values were often slightly lower at a35 and slightly higher at be35 fig 5 this ecss distribution is generally in accordance with the typical salt distribution pattern found in drip irrigated crops low salt accumulation under the emitters and accumulation of salts at the perimeter of the wetting front shalhevet 1994 thus the mean ecss for the 2015 tomato crop determined from gs3 measurements was substantially higher outside 7 2 ds m 1 at c35 than inside the wet silty clay loam layer table 3 moreover the mean ecss in the wet bulb was narrowly and linearly related to that measured at each of the four representative positions fig 5 consequently the mean ecss in the wet bulb can be correctly controlled by monitoring one of these representative positions since the errors of using measurements from these positions were relatively low table 5 nonetheless it should be taken into account that the measurement at a35 may slightly underestimate the mean ecss of the wet bulb while the measurement at be35 may slightly overestimate it two methods of monitoring the ecss were assessed throughout three tomato crops the suction cup a lysimeter method cabrera corral et al 2016 de pascale et al 2017 and the gs3 a dielectric method of interest for automated control of irrigations systems visconti et al 2014 the relationships between the ecss estimated from gs3 measurements and that measured with the suction cup varied depending mostly on the position within the wet bulb and on the cropping year fig 6 but the expression of hilhorst 2000 used by the gs3 did not generally provide accurate estimates of the ecss measured with suction cup fig 6 and table 3 especially during the second half of the crops when salts accumulated in the soil malicki and walczak 1999 visconti et al 2014 besides soil solution salinity or soil type other factors may influence the output of this sensor and or its estimation method since the absolute values and the seasonal dynamics observed at the four positions of the wet bulb were different fig 5 the best position for monitoring the ecss with gs3 appears to be a35 the centre of the wet bulb in this position the seasonal ecss dynamics was relatively similar for both methods and the absolute values coincided throughout most of the first half of the three tomato cycles fig 6 moreover in this position salinity changes might occur faster or more clearly overall the gs3 at a35 did not provide accurate ecss estimates to be used for detailed studies especially under soil salinity conditions but it might be useful for identifying tendencies or relevant changes in automated irrigation systems pooling data from this position for the three crops studied the regression analysis between both variables presented a moderate linear fit ecss sc 1 56 ecss gs3 2 45 r2 0 81 n 33 consequently when monitoring soil salinity in soil grown mediterranean greenhouse crops with gs3 type sensors it may be advisable to check the accuracy of the ecss estimations by taking simultaneously measurements with suction cup at relevant crop phases especially if the soil salinity is expected to change substantially e g during the second half of tomato crop cycles in spring when salts usually accumulate in the wet bulb incrocci et al 2009 in horticultural substrates and valdés et al 2014 in potted ornamental plants found that the eca was closely related to the ecss and can be regarded as a useful tool for monitoring and controlling soil salinity however in soil grown mediterranean greenhouse crops the eca from gs3 can be used for identifying tendencies or relevant changes but not for detailed studies since it was only moderately related to ecss measured with suction cup fig 4 the seasonal dynamics of the concentration of sodium potassium nitrate or calcium was rather similar at the four representative positions of the wet bulb throughout most of the 2015 tomato cycle figs 5 and 7 a similar response was observed for chloride magnesium and sulphate although the number of samples considered was lower data not shown moreover the mean concentration of sodium potassium nitrate or calcium in the wet bulb was linearly related to that measured at each of the four representative positions especially for sodium and potassium figs 5 and 7 and the errors of using measurements from these positions for estimating the mean concentration in the wet bulb were generally low to moderate depending on the position and the element table 5 in general at a35 the centre of the wet bulb the nutrient concentration especially for very mobile elements such as nitrate was more variable than at the other more distant positions fig 7 in conclusion the soil solution concentration of the main salts and nutrients in drip irrigated soil grown tomato crops in mediterranean greenhouses can be fairly well monitored by sampling the soil solution with suction cup at any of the four representative positions of the wet bulb this can be attributed to the relatively low spatial gradient of salts and nutrients observed in the wet bulb where most roots grow and absorb water and nutrients gonzález 2003 and to the capacity of tomato roots to adapt to the unequal distribution of salts and nutrients in the root environment sonneveld and vogt 1990 however it appears advisable to collect soil solution samples at the centre of the wet bulb a35 because samples from this position might respond faster to changes in the nutrient solution supplied or the root activity especially for very mobile elements such as nitrate 5 conclusions in three drip irrigated greenhouse tomato crops the seasonal dynamics and the absolute values of the θw gs3 and especially the ecss and the concentrations of relevant nutrients and salts measured in samples collected with suction cup were relatively homogeneous within the wet bulb however the best position for soil monitoring the concentration of nutrients and salts appears to be the centre of the wet bulb because samples from this position might respond faster to changes in the nutrient solution supplied or the root activity especially for very mobile elements such as nitrate the relationship between the ecss measured with suction cup and that estimated from gs3 varied depending mostly on the position in the wet bulb and on the cropping year in general the gs3 did not provide accurate ecss estimates to be used for detailed studies especially during the second half of the tomato crops when salts accumulated in the soil however measurements of gs3 eca or ecss at the centre of the wet bulb might be useful for identifying tendencies or relevant changes in automated irrigation systems acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the spanish ministry of economy and competitiveness the

11475,this work was mainly aimed at studying the spatio temporal distribution of water content θw bulk eca and soil solution ecss electrical conductivity measured with a dielectric sensor gs3 and a tension lysimeter suction cup throughout three drip irrigated tomato crops in mediterranean greenhouses the mean θw gs3 for the wet bulb was well estimated by measuring at representative positions especially at the centre of the wet bulb the ecss substantially increased in the wet bulb irrespective of the soil position reaching relatively high values 6 7 ds m 1 in the second half of the cycles mostly due to sodium and chloride accumulation the mean ecss for the wet bulb was narrowly and linearly related to that measured at any of four representative positions in the wet bulb which presented similar seasonal dynamics and absolute values throughout most of the crops the mean ecss for the wet bulb can be well estimated by measuring at one of these positions since the errors of using measurements from these positions were relatively low the relationship between the ecss estimated from gs3 and that measured with suction cup varied depending mostly on soil position and cropping year but the gs3 did not generally provide accurate ecss estimates especially in the second half of the cycles when salts accumulated in the soil despite this measurements of eca and ecss from gs3 at the centre of the wet bulb might be useful for identifying tendencies or relevant salinity changes for automated irrigation systems the solution concentration for main salts and nutrients can be fairly well monitored by sampling at any of the four representative positions of the wet bulb however it appears advisable to measure at the centre of the wet bulb as samples from this position might respond faster to changes in the nutrient solution supply or the root activity especially for very mobile elements such as nitrate keywords bulk and solution electrical conductivity dielectric permittivity gs3 soil matric potential salinity suction cup 1 introduction in heavily fertigated intensive agricultural systems such as mediterranean greenhouses feasible soil monitoring protocols are needed for optimising crop irrigation and fertilization and especially for minimising soil and water pollution this is particularly relevant in irrigation areas with scarce water resources of low or medium quality such as the se spanish mediterranean coast in this area the groundwater the main irrigation source has been vastly overexploited and presents increasing problems of nitrate contamination and salinization casas et al 2015 but most greenhouse farmers still continue using irrigation and fertigation practices based on their experiences thompson et al 2007b without monitoring or controlling the soil water nutrient and salt status a representative monitoring of the soil solute content in agricultural soils requires a thorough knowledge of the soil spatial distribution of water nutrients and salts throughout the crop cycles especially in intensive drip irrigated crops several lysimetry methods have been introduced for nutrient and salt soil monitoring and the suction cup sampler is the most common one in spanish mediterranean greenhouse crops cabrera corral et al 2016 de pascale et al 2017 in this area there has been appreciable experimental work in recent years with the use of suction cup samplers and extension materials with protocols for their use have been developed de pascale et al 2017 this method which extracts the soil solution with a low cost tension lysimeter is effective in greenhouse soils usually maintained moist at soil matric potentials close to field capacity and appears to represent well the soil concentration of the available elements especially under unsaturated flow conditions cabrera corral et al 2016 additionally an increasing number of dielectric sensors are being developed for continuous measurement of the water content θw and the apparent or bulk electrical conductivity eca of soils for agricultural and environmental purposes some of these sensors can also estimate the electrical conductivity of the pore a variable closely related to the soil salinity in contact with plant roots or the electrical conductivity of soil solution ecss the eca i e the ec of the soil water and air complex is influenced by several physical and chemical soil properties such as salinity saturation percentage water content bulk density and temperature it usually increases with water content and the slope of this relationship depends on the level of salinity the higher the salinity the steeper the slope amente et al 2000 moret fernández et al 2012 these authors also observed that the eca at a constant θw was linearly related to the ecss showing steeper slopes at higher θw values incrocci et al 2009 also found that the eca of horticultural substrates was best related to the ecss at high θw values moreover valdés et al 2014 found that although the eca is not a true reading of the soil solution salinity it is a closely related parameter which can be regarded as a useful tool for mitigating the negative effects of saline conditions in the production of potted ornamental plants thus when the ecss cannot be measured directly or estimated accurately the eca appears to be a reliable variable for evaluating soil salinity in crop media usually maintained at high water contents the ecss can be measured periodically in soil solution samples extracted with suction cup or estimated continually with empirical calibration equations or physical based models using eca and θw measurements hendrickx et al 2002 several models of varying complexity have been developed to determine the ecss from dielectric sensor measurements amente et al 2000 hilhorst 2000 incrocci et al 2009 moret fernández et al 2012 e g gs3 and wet sensors estimate the ecss with the expression developed by hilhorst 2000 however there are a variety of factors such as soil solution salinity or soil type which can influence the output of these sensors and their estimation methods malicki and walczak 1999 visconti et al 2014 though the use of dielectric sensors for continuous monitoring of θw eca and ecss in agricultural soils appears to be promising further work and testing is required to improve their accuracy and applicability in the field especially in intensive systems under saline soil conditions this work was mainly aimed at i studying the spatio temporal distribution of water content bulk and soil solution electrical conductivity measurements with a dielectric sensor gs3 and a tension lysimeter suction cup throughout drip irrigated greenhouse tomato crops ii assessing the reliability of bulk electrical and soil solution conductivity measurements using gs3 to monitor soil salinity status 2 material and methods 2 1 site and experiment experiments were carried out in parral types greenhouses 24 m 18 m located at las palmerillas cajamar foundation 2 43 w 36 4 n 155 m a s l on the almería coast se spain the greenhouses were low cost structures covered with plastic film and with layered soils known as enarenado and of widespread use in the region wittwer and castilla 1995 a first tomato crop solanum lycopersicum l cv genio was grown from 3 february to 6 july 2015 the soil consisted of the naturally occurring gravelly sandy loam soil covered with a 0 4 m layer of imported silty clay loam soil a 0 02 m layer of dried manure and an upper 0 1 m mulch layer of coarse sand and fine gravel particles with time and use the manure layer was practically mineralised and disappeared and the 0 1 m upper part of the imported soil layer was mixed with sand and gravel particles from the top layer the upper limit of drained water content field capacity for the imported silty clay loam layer was 0 37 m3 m 3 and the lower limit wilting point was 0 14 m3 m 3 the total amount of irrigation water supplied was 348 mm 12 mm applied before planting and irrigation was applied daily except at the beginning of the cycle february the estimated seasonal crop evapotranspiration was 307 mm this tomato crop was subjected to five irrigation strategies in order to obtain a wide and representative range of water and salt soil conditions strategy 1 s1 25 02 29 03 2015 irrigation rates slightly lower than the crop water requirements short irrigations of about 0 67 mm with water of about 1 7 ds m 1 ec or with nutrient solution of 2 5 ds m 1 ec to enhance crop rooting strategy 2 s2 30 03 23 04 irrigation rates about 30 higher than the crop water requirements long irrigation events with a nutrient solution of about 2 5 ds m 1 ec to increase soil water availability strategy 3 s3 24 04 21 05 short irrigation events of

tensiometer strategy 4 s4 22 05 14 06 irrigation rates about 30 higher than the crop water requirements long irrigation events with a nutrient solution of about 2 0 ds m 1 ec for salt leaching strategy 5 s5 15 06 06 07 short irrigation events of about 0 67 mm with a nutrient solution of about 2 5 ds m 1 ec supplied when the θw at 0 35 m depth below the emitter and plant was below 0 35 m3 m 3 at two of the three gs3 sensors or below 0 33 m3 m 3 at one gs3 at the end of this strategy the threshold θw values increased to 0 38 m3 m 3 at two of the sensors and to 0 36 m3 m 3 at one a second cv valkiria and third cv ateneo tomato crop were also grown from 3 february to 29 june 2016 and from 13 september 2016 to 24 may 2017 respectively in a similar parral type greenhouse 24 m 18 m the enarenado soil was of similar textural characteristics to that used in the previous season but only about 0 05 m upper part of the imported soil layer was mixed with sand and gravel particles from the

methodology adapted to mediterranean greenhouses bonachela et al 2006 fernández et al 2010 orgaz et al 2005 before each crop cycle the greenhouse was irrigated abundantly to wet the soil and especially to leach the salts accumulated over the previous cropping year thompson et al 2007b the external surface of the plastic greenhouses was whitewashed throughout the spring to avoid excessive greenhouse air temperatures 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 soil solution sampling in the 2015 tomato cycle 12 suction cups model ssat irrometer riverside ca usa sc were installed randomly before crop planting at four soil positions three repetitions per position in the silty clay loam layer fig 1 six were installed at 0 02 0 05 m from emitter and plant three in the middle at 0 35 m depth a35 and the other three in the lower part at 0 45 m depth a45 of the silty clay loam layer six were installed at 0 25 m from the emitter in the middle of silty clay loam layer at 0 35 m depth three perpendicular to the drip line br35 and three between two contiguous emitters below the drip line be35 in the 2016 and 2016 17 tomato cycles 12 suction cups three per position were also installed at a35 a45 be35 and br35 every two three weeks a suction of about 50 60 kpa was applied to each suction cup four hours after irrigation and the soil solution was collected early the following day and stored at 4 c before use the cups were cleaned by rinsing with hydrochloric acid and deionized water weihermüller et al 2007 the electrical conductivity of the soil solution ecss ds m 1 was measured with a conductivimeter basic model 30 crison instruments sa barcelona spain concentration of the main soil nutrients nitrate potassium calcium magnesium sodium chloride and sulphate was measured throughout the 2015 cycle using standard laboratory methods mapa 1994 at most sampling dates the concentration of nitrate potassium calcium and sodium was also measured with laqua twin no3 k ca2 and na sensors horiba instruments inc ca usa respectively at all the sampling dates throughout the three tomato cycles strong linear relationships between laqua sensors and laboratory measurements were found for nitrate potassium calcium and sodium and the errors of using these rapid analysis methods were relatively low cabrera corral et al 2016 these relationships were applied to correct laqua data for the sampling dates when laboratory measurements were not conducted 2 2 2 soil water potential the soil matric potential ψm was continuously measured in the centre of the wet soil bulb a35 with three digital tensiometers model isrrsu 300 irrometer 2 2 3 soil water content and bulk electrical conductivity soil bulk dielectric permittivity εa unitless temperature c and bulk electrical conductivity eca ds m

installed before planting december 2014 at eight representative soil positions three per position fig 1 at a35 a45 be35 and br35 at 0 45 m depth and 0 25 m from the emitter perpendicular to the drip line br45 and between two contiguous emitters below the drip line be45 in the upper part of the gravelly sandy loam layer at 0 55 m depth and 0 02 0 05 m from emitter and plant a55 and at 0 35 m depth and 0 5 m from the emitter perpendicular to the drip line c35 during the 2016 and 2016 17 tomato cycles six gs3 sensors installed before planting december 2015 at the two more representative positions in the silty clay loam layer three at a35 and three at be35 fig 1 were monitored at each position the volumetric soil water content θw m3 m 3 was determined from εa values using the default

17632 hsncnbwv2f 1 3 results 3 1 soil matric potential water content and bulk electrical conductivity for a wide range of irrigation conditions throughout the 2015 crop the seasonal evolution of the mean daily values of the soil water content θw and the soil bulk electrical conductivity eca at different soil depths pooling data from all the positions at the same depth in the soil wetted by the emitters or wet bulb and at the most representative positions within the wet bulb are shown by figs 2 and 3 respectively the irrigation water generally reached all the measured positions throughout most of the 2015 tomato cycle figs 2 and 3 except the soil located 0 5 m perpendicular to the drip line in the middle of the silty clay loam layer c35 the θw at this position was steady throughout most of the cycle and presented values substantially lower than those measured at the other positions in the silty clay loam layer fig 2 which indicates that the irrigation water front did not usually reach this position therefore considering the measurement volume sensed by the gs3 decagon devices 2016 the emitters wetted the silty clay loam layer to about 0 30 m on both sides of the drip line wet bulb in general rather similar dynamics were observed for the θw and the eca at the measured positions in the wet soil bulb throughout most of the 2015 tomato crop figs 2 and 3 at the beginning of the cycle the crop was slightly under irrigated to enhance root growth and crop establishment s1 which reduced progressively the ψm in the middle of the silty clay loam soil layer below the emitter and plant a35 and the mean θw and the mean eca in the middle 0 35 m depth and at the bottom 0 45 m depth of the wet silty clay loam layer fig 2 the automatic application of short irrigations to keep the ψm above 20 or 30 kpa s3 maintained relatively steady the θw and the eca at a35 and at a45 and in the upper part of the gravelly sandy loam soil layer at 0 55 m depth a55 however this irrigation strategy increased substantially the θw and especially the eca at be35 the soil position between two contiguous emitters in the middle of the wet silty clay loam layer the application of long irrigations events with irrigation rates higher than the tomato water requirements increased substantially s2 or maintained high s4 the ψm at a35 and the mean values of θw and eca in the middle and at the bottom of the wet silty clay loam layer fig 2 this strategy also increased the θw at a55 in both scenarios and reduced the θw and the eca at be35 during s4 finally the application of short irrigations to keep the θw above a threshold value of 35 m3 m 3 at a35 s5 resulted in irrigation rates lower than the tomato water requirements which decreased substantially the ψm at a35 and to a much lesser extent the θw in the middle and lower parts of the wet silty clay loam layer and in the upper part of the gravelly sandy loam soil layer this strategy also increased the eca at a35 and be35 moreover when the threshold of θw was raised to 38 m3 m 3 at the end of this scenario the ψm drastically increased to values above 20 kpa and the θw and the eca substantially increased at all the measured positions figs 2 and 3 the θw in the middle pooling measurements at 0 35 m depth of the wet silty clay loam layer was relatively similar to that in the lower part of this layer pooling data at 0 45 m depth throughout the 2015 tomato cycle irrespective of the irrigation scenario fig 2 the seasonal θw dynamics was also generally similar at the more representative soil positions of the wet silty clay loam layer fig 3 while there were differences in the absolute values between some positions especially at be35 and br35 the positions located between two contiguous emitters and further from the emitter line respectively in the middle of the wet silty clay loam layer fig 3 in the linear regression analysis fig 4 and table 2 good fits were observed between the θw at a35 and a45 and the mean θw for the whole wet silty clay loam layer and the errors of using measurements at a35 and a45 for estimating the mean θw in the wet silty clay loam layer were low table 2 the rmse and the mean absolute error mae were lower than 0 01 m3 m 3 for both positions the eca in the middle pooling data at 0 35 m depth of the wet silty clay loam layer was also similar to that measured in the lower part of this soil layer throughout the 2015 tomato cycle regardless of the irrigation scenario fig 2 the seasonal dynamics of the eca was also rather similar at the more representative soil positions in the wet silty clay loam layer fig 3 but there were differences in the absolute values between some positions especially at br35 in the linear regression analysis good fits were observed between the eca at a35 a45 and be35 and the mean eca for the wet silty clay loam layer fig 4 and table 2 although measurements from these positions tended to underestimate the mean eca in the wet silty clay loam layer fig 4 for be35 the rmse was 0 08 ds m 1 and the mae was 0 07 ds m 1 for a35 the rmse was 0 11 ds m 1 and the mae was 0 10 ds m 1 and for a45 the rmse and the mae were 0 11 ds m 1 table 2 the seasonal dynamics of the mean daily eca appears to be similar to that of the mean daily θw in the middle and in the lower part of the wet silty clay loam layer throughout most of the 2015 tomato cycle fig 2 the linear regression analysis showed that the mean daily eca in the wet silty clay loam layer was narrowly and linearly related to the mean daily θw especially when data from the first scenario s1 were separated from the other scenarios fig 4 eca ds m 1 3 69θw m3 m 3 0 51 r2 0 99 over the whole 2015 tomato cycle the average standard deviation of the mean daily θw among gs3 sensors located in the same position varied depending on the soil position reaching values of 0 05 m3 m 3 table 3 the average standard deviation of the mean daily eca behaved similarly table 3 reaching even higher values in some positions up to 0 24 ds m 1 3 2 soil solution electrical conductivity the soil spatial distribution throughout the 2015 tomato crop of the ecss measured in solution samples collected with suction cup at four representative positions in the wet silty clay loam layer is shown in fig 5 the ecss at the beginning of the cycle when the crop was slightly under irrigated s1 maintained relatively steady and was similar for the four positions later the crop was over irrigated s2 and the ecss substantially increased for all the positions reaching values between 6 and 7 ds m 1 at end of this scenario then the automatic application of short irrigations to ensure a high ψm s3 maintained or increased the ecss higher values were found for the positions located further from emitters at be35 and br35 although there were no significant differences between positions hereafter the crop was over irrigated with long irrigation events s4 which reduced the ecss at most positions especially those located further from emitters finally the ecss increased at all the positions at the end of the last scenario s5 when the crop was first under irrigated and later over irrigated by applying short irrigations to keep the swc above various set points overall considering the whole 2015 tomato cycle the mean seasonal ecss was slightly but significantly lower at a35 5 4 ds m 1 than at a45 5 8 ds m 1 br35 6 1 ds m 1 and be35 5 9 ds m 1 in general the seasonal ecss dynamics was similar at the four measured positions throughout most of the 2015 fig 5 2016 and 2016 17 tomato cycles data not shown overall considering the three cycles good linear regression fits were found between the ecss measured at a45 br35 and especially at a35 and be35 and the mean ecss for the whole wet silty clay loam layer fig 5 moreover the errors of using data from these positions for estimating the mean ecss for the wet silty clay loam layer were low table 4 the rmse varied between 0 3 and 0 5 ds m 1 and the mae between 0 2 and 0 4 ds m 1 the ecss from suction cup was related to the eca measured with gs3 at two representative positions in the wet silty clay loam layer throughout the three tomato cycles fig 4 pooling data from both positions in the three crops the regression analysis presented a moderate fit r2 0 67 between both variables which were related by a polynomic curve the ecss measured in solution samples extracted with suction cups was compared to that estimated from gs3 data at representative positions in the wet silty clay loam layer throughout the three tomato cycles fig 6 in the first crop the seasonal ecss dynamics was similar for both methods at a45 and especially at a35 but not for the whole tomato cycle while it substantially differed between methods at the two other positions e g the ecss from gs3 at br35 hardly changed during the cycle while that from the suction cup presented substantial changes moreover the ecss from gs3 was usually lower than that from the suction cup at all the positions during the second half of this tomato cycle with significant differences for some sampling dates at be35 and especially at a45 and br35 overall the mean seasonal ecss estimated from gs3 was significantly lower than that measured in the suction cup at a35 and a45 table 4 in the second tomato crop similar ecss dynamics was observed for both methods at a35 fig 6 and be35 data not shown but the ecss from gs3 was usually lower than that from the suction cup during the second half of the cycle at both positions finally the seasonal dynamics and the absolute values of ecss at a35 were rather similar for both methods throughout most of the 2016 17 cycle fig 6 although ecss values from gs3 were slightly lower during the second half of the crop overall the mean seasonal ecss estimated from gs3 measurements was significantly lower than that measured in the suction cup at a35 and be35 in the 2016 crop but no significant differences were found between methods in the 2016 17 crop table 4 for the 2015 tomato crop the average standard deviation of the mean daily ecss reached relatively high values in some soil positions table 3 ranging between 0 26 and 1 43 ds m 1 for estimated gs3 values and between 0 54 and 0 82 ds m 1 for measured suction cup values 3 3 soil solution nutrient and salt concentration the concentrations of potassium calcium and sodium increased throughout most of the 2015 tomato cycle especially sodium figs 5 and 7 the seasonal concentration dynamics of these elements was rather similar at the four positions throughout most of this tomato cycle figs 5 and 7 although the absolute values of sodium were usually lower at a35 than at the other positions similar responses were found for the concentrations of magnesium chloride and sulphate data not shown when the sodium potassium or calcium concentrations from the three tomato cycles were assessed together using linear regression analysis good to moderate fits were found between the concentration of these elements at each of the four measured positions and the mean concentration for the whole wet silty clay loam layer figs 5 and 7 table 5 the errors of using measurements from these positions for estimating the mean concentration in the wet silty clay loam layer were generally low to moderate depending on the position and element in general the a35 position presented lower concentration values for sodium and more variable concentration values for potassium and calcium the nitrate concentration in the soil solution decreased throughout most of the 2015 tomato cycle at the four representative positions of the wet silty clay loam layer fig 7 this concentration was generally around or below that of the supplied nutrient solution but it reached values close to zero at the end of the period when the crop was over irrigated with long irrigation events to reduce salt accumulation s4 the seasonal dynamics of nitrate concentration was rather similar at the four measured positions except at the end of the crop when it was significantly higher at a35 fig 7 moreover when the three tomato cycles were assessed together the linear regression analysis between the nitrate concentration at each of the four measured positions and the mean value for the wet silty clay loam layer fig 7 presented moderate fits table 5 especially at a35 which showed the lowest and the highest nitrate concentration values the errors of using data from these four positions for estimating the mean nitrate concentration for the wet silty clay loam layer were relatively higher than those found for the other elements especially at a35 table 5 the rmse ranged between 1 4 and 2 7 mmol l 1 and the mae varied between 1 0 and 1 6 mmol l 1 4 discussion the spatio temporal distribution of θw eca and ecss was assessed in depth using dielectric gs3 and lysimetry suction cup methods throughout drip irrigated greenhouse tomato crops the emitters wetted the silty clay loam soil layer to about 0 30 m from both sides of the drip line throughout most of the 2015 crop cycle fig 2 a similar soil volume was wetted by the emitters in a cucumber crop grown in a mediterranean greenhouse with an enarenado soil gonzález 2003 this wet layer or bulb usually concentrates most roots and water and nutrient uptake of fruit vegetable crops in mediterranean greenhouses gonzález 2003 padilla et al 2017 the seasonal dynamics and the absolute values of the mean daily θw in the middle of the wet layer or bulb pooling measurements at 0 35 m depth were similar to those found in the lower part of this layer throughout most of the 2015 tomato cycle fig 2 moreover the mean daily θw for the whole wet bulb layer was narrowly and linearly related to the θw measured at some representative positions fig 4 the mean daily θw for the wet bulb was correctly estimated by measuring at a45 and especially at a35 fig 4 since the errors of using measurements from these two positions were low and below the accuracy of soil water content sensors table 2 the measurement at a35 the position located in the centre of the wet bulb fig 1 appears to be the best position for estimating the mean daily θw in the wet bulb fig 4 table 2 although other representative positions can also provide good predictions the variability of the mean daily θw among sensors located in the same position was relatively high at some soil positions table 3 the average standard deviation of the mean daily θw for the 2015 tomato crop reached values of 0 05 m3 m 3 at some positions this relatively high θw variability might be explained at least partially by heterogeneity in soil properties and water relations inherent or induced by sensor installation presence of gravel or larger particles soil density air gaps etc and other variability sources evett et al 2007 as well as by the relatively small soil volume sensed by the gs3 decagon devices 2016 this phenomenon which is common in dielectric devices sensing small soil volumes might also explain some of the θw differences observed between soil positions in the wet bulb such as the lower absolute θw values found at be35 fig 3 on the other hand the ψm measured with tensiometer at a35 was generally more sensitive to changes in soil water status than the θw measured with gs3 especially during the s5 strategy figs 2 and 3 in this period the ψm decreased substantially while the θw decreased only slightly the high soil salinity level found in this period about 6 ds m 1 or higher fig 5 might have affected θw measurements with gs3 bitelli 2011 pardossi et al 2009 visconti et al 2014 in conclusion when monitoring the soil water status in soil grown mediterranean greenhouse crops with dielectric sensors such as the gs3 it appears advisable to i locate the gs3 in the centre of the wet bulb below the emitter ii work with relative θw values in order to minimize data variability among sensors located in the same position iii define a comfort θw range i e the threshold value of available soil water content thompson et al 2007a based on ψm measurements at the beginning of the crop cycle and iv redefine this comfort θw range if soil salinity or other relevant conditions change substantially during the crop cycle additionally an extra dielectric sensor might be located in the upper part of the gravelly sandy loam layer at a55 so as to minimize or control over irrigation the seasonal dynamics and the absolute values of the mean daily eca in the middle part of the wet bulb were also similar to those measured in the lower part of this layer throughout most of the 2015 tomato cycle fig 2 the mean daily eca for the wet bulb was also narrowly and linearly related to the eca measured at some representative positions e g at a35 a45 and be35 fig 4 but the errors of using measurements from these positions for estimating the mean eca in the wet bulb were relatively higher than those found for θw table 2 moreover the mean daily values of the eca in the wet bulb were linearly related to the corresponding mean daily θw values fig 4 but the slope of this relationship changed with the level of soil salinity as observed in previous works amente et al 2000 moret fernández et al 2012 the slope of this relationship was steeper for measurements from scenarios s2 to s5 than for those taken at the beginning of the tomato cycle s1 when the salinity in the wet bulb was substantially lower fig 4 greenhouse farmers from the se spanish mediterranean coast usually irrigate abundantly in summer during the period without crop to wet the soil and especially to leach the salts accumulated over the previous cropping year thompson et al 2007b however this irrigation practice may not suffice to control the soil salinity the following crop cycle if moderate brackish or saline waters are used for irrigation as frequently occurs in this area where the groundwater the main agricultural water source is becoming increasingly salinized due to seawater intrusion throughout most of the 2015 tomato cycle the ecss substantially increased in the wet bulb regardless of the soil position fig 5 reaching relatively high values of about 6 7 ds m 1 these values appear to be above those considered optimum for greenhouse tomato production maas and hoffman 1977 sonneveld and vogt 2009 the ecss increment was mostly due to the accumulation of sodium and chloride in the wet bulb fig 5 which were abundantly supplied in the irrigation water table 1 and are scarcely absorbed by the tomato crop sonneveld and vogt 2009 the mean solution concentration of these elements for the wet bulb reached values of 31 5 mmol l 1 for sodium and 59 6 mmol l 1 for chloride at the end of 2015 tomato cycle these concentrations may also induce specific salinity effects toxicity or nutrient disturbance but no symptoms were detected throughout this cycle in order to reduce excessive soil salinity levels some greenhouse tomato growers from this area over irrigate their crops although this practice has not been well documented in the 2015 tomato cycle the effectiveness of over irrigating varied depending on the water and salinity status of the soil over irrigating after a mild soil drying period with relatively low soil salinity levels s2 substantially increased the soil content of water salts and some nutrients at all the positions of the wet bulb figs 3 5 7 at relatively low soil salinity levels in the wet bulb s2 the rate of soil salinization mostly depends on the amount of saline water applied meiri 1984 shalhevet 1994 on the other hand over irrigating when the soil content of water and solutes in the wet bulb was high s4 reduced the concentration of salts and some nutrients figs 5 and 7 therefore the leaching fraction should be applied once the salt accumulation in the root environment reaches hazardous levels meiri 1984 shalhevet 1994 e g for mediterranean greenhouse tomato crops it should be applied over the spring period when the soil salinity has usually reached high values fig 5 and the evaporative demand increases fernández et al 2010 the seasonal dynamics and the absolute values of ecss were relatively similar at the four representative positions in the wet bulb throughout most of the 2015 tomato cycle fig 5 although absolute values were often slightly lower at a35 and slightly higher at be35 fig 5 this ecss distribution is generally in accordance with the typical salt distribution pattern found in drip irrigated crops low salt accumulation under the emitters and accumulation of salts at the perimeter of the wetting front shalhevet 1994 thus the mean ecss for the 2015 tomato crop determined from gs3 measurements was substantially higher outside 7 2 ds m 1 at c35 than inside the wet silty clay loam layer table 3 moreover the mean ecss in the wet bulb was narrowly and linearly related to that measured at each of the four representative positions fig 5 consequently the mean ecss in the wet bulb can be correctly controlled by monitoring one of these representative positions since the errors of using measurements from these positions were relatively low table 5 nonetheless it should be taken into account that the measurement at a35 may slightly underestimate the mean ecss of the wet bulb while the measurement at be35 may slightly overestimate it two methods of monitoring the ecss were assessed throughout three tomato crops the suction cup a lysimeter method cabrera corral et al 2016 de pascale et al 2017 and the gs3 a dielectric method of interest for automated control of irrigations systems visconti et al 2014 the relationships between the ecss estimated from gs3 measurements and that measured with the suction cup varied depending mostly on the position within the wet bulb and on the cropping year fig 6 but the expression of hilhorst 2000 used by the gs3 did not generally provide accurate estimates of the ecss measured with suction cup fig 6 and table 3 especially during the second half of the crops when salts accumulated in the soil malicki and walczak 1999 visconti et al 2014 besides soil solution salinity or soil type other factors may influence the output of this sensor and or its estimation method since the absolute values and the seasonal dynamics observed at the four positions of the wet bulb were different fig 5 the best position for monitoring the ecss with gs3 appears to be a35 the centre of the wet bulb in this position the seasonal ecss dynamics was relatively similar for both methods and the absolute values coincided throughout most of the first half of the three tomato cycles fig 6 moreover in this position salinity changes might occur faster or more clearly overall the gs3 at a35 did not provide accurate ecss estimates to be used for detailed studies especially under soil salinity conditions but it might be useful for identifying tendencies or relevant changes in automated irrigation systems pooling data from this position for the three crops studied the regression analysis between both variables presented a moderate linear fit ecss sc 1 56 ecss gs3 2 45 r2 0 81 n 33 consequently when monitoring soil salinity in soil grown mediterranean greenhouse crops with gs3 type sensors it may be advisable to check the accuracy of the ecss estimations by taking simultaneously measurements with suction cup at relevant crop phases especially if the soil salinity is expected to change substantially e g during the second half of tomato crop cycles in spring when salts usually accumulate in the wet bulb incrocci et al 2009 in horticultural substrates and valdés et al 2014 in potted ornamental plants found that the eca was closely related to the ecss and can be regarded as a useful tool for monitoring and controlling soil salinity however in soil grown mediterranean greenhouse crops the eca from gs3 can be used for identifying tendencies or relevant changes but not for detailed studies since it was only moderately related to ecss measured with suction cup fig 4 the seasonal dynamics of the concentration of sodium potassium nitrate or calcium was rather similar at the four representative positions of the wet bulb throughout most of the 2015 tomato cycle figs 5 and 7 a similar response was observed for chloride magnesium and sulphate although the number of samples considered was lower data not shown moreover the mean concentration of sodium potassium nitrate or calcium in the wet bulb was linearly related to that measured at each of the four representative positions especially for sodium and potassium figs 5 and 7 and the errors of using measurements from these positions for estimating the mean concentration in the wet bulb were generally low to moderate depending on the position and the element table 5 in general at a35 the centre of the wet bulb the nutrient concentration especially for very mobile elements such as nitrate was more variable than at the other more distant positions fig 7 in conclusion the soil solution concentration of the main salts and nutrients in drip irrigated soil grown tomato crops in mediterranean greenhouses can be fairly well monitored by sampling the soil solution with suction cup at any of the four representative positions of the wet bulb this can be attributed to the relatively low spatial gradient of salts and nutrients observed in the wet bulb where most roots grow and absorb water and nutrients gonzález 2003 and to the capacity of tomato roots to adapt to the unequal distribution of salts and nutrients in the root environment sonneveld and vogt 1990 however it appears advisable to collect soil solution samples at the centre of the wet bulb a35 because samples from this position might respond faster to changes in the nutrient solution supplied or the root activity especially for very mobile elements such as nitrate 5 conclusions in three drip irrigated greenhouse tomato crops the seasonal dynamics and the absolute values of the θw gs3 and especially the ecss and the concentrations of relevant nutrients and salts measured in samples collected with suction cup were relatively homogeneous within the wet bulb however the best position for soil monitoring the concentration of nutrients and salts appears to be the centre of the wet bulb because samples from this position might respond faster to changes in the nutrient solution supplied or the root activity especially for very mobile elements such as nitrate the relationship between the ecss measured with suction cup and that estimated from gs3 varied depending mostly on the position in the wet bulb and on the cropping year in general the gs3 did not provide accurate ecss estimates to be used for detailed studies especially during the second half of the tomato crops when salts accumulated in the soil however measurements of gs3 eca or ecss at the centre of the wet bulb might be useful for identifying tendencies or relevant changes in automated irrigation systems acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the spanish ministry of economy and competitiveness the

11476,in the face of population growth and the consequent increase in water and energy consumption coupled with concern about climate change society has sought renewable energy sources such as biofuels brazil has excelled in the production of ethanol using sugarcane as its raw material and in recent years there has been an advance in sugarcane production towards the brazilian cerrado due to the existence of suitable areas and the availability of water to expand irrigated agriculture recognizing this we sought to analyze the potential for expansion of the planted areas in the paracatu river basin under full and deficit conditions of irrigation and both natural and potential water availability potential irrigation areas pias were estimated as a function of the average required unit flow rates for sugarcane irrigation and water availability according to the criteria for granting concessions in the state of minas gerais which were compared to the areas currently planted with sugarcane and with all crops in a macro scale analysis considering that the water available is only for irrigation and that it is the only restrictive factor for the expansion of the agricultural areas based on the minimum annual flow it would be possible to irrigate in the paracatu river basin more than 120 000 ha indicating that the water demands could be supplied in 21 of the planted areas already existing in the basin which could be increased by up to 19 by the use of deficit irrigation with the availability of water potential it would be possible to supply the water demands of the entire area planted with permanent and temporary crops and there is also the possibility of expansion into up to 170 of these areas keywords water resource biofuels sustainability 1 introduction the increase in the per capita consumption of essential inputs such as water and energy coupled with growing concern about climate change has made society increasingly seek sources of renewable energy as an alternative for reducing oil consumption fargione et al 2008 silva et al 2011 lourenzani et al 2016 renewable sources include biofuels mainly produced by oilseeds and sugarcane thus increasing the search for areas suitable for planting these crops brazil has been considered a great power for the expansion of biofuel production without compromising food production since there are agricultural areas suitable for the production of the raw material with favorable edaphoclimatic conditions and relative abundance in water resources and in addition the country has the technology and labor highlighting it in the international market nass et al 2007 goldemberg et al 2008 lourenzani et al 2016 due to these characteristics among the raw materials for the production of biofuels brazil has been outstanding in the production of soybeans corn and sugarcane among the three crops cited sugarcane is the third temporary crop in terms of area occupation but nonetheless the country has stood out in the production of ethanol using it as raw material that is also used in sugar production and animal feed mainly due to the photosynthetic conversion of sugarcane which allows productivity well above other crops in 2015 brazil produced about 30 billion liters of ethanol and it was estimated that in the 2016 17 crop the production could exceed this value epe 2015 conab 2016 sugarcane production in brazil started in the northeast region and today is concentrated in the center south region due to the favorable climatic conditions for its production however in the search for new areas for cane production in recent years there has been an advance of the agricultural frontier toward the brazilian cerrado owing to the greater availability of water and the existence of areas suitable for sugarcane cultivation even if precipitation is concentrated in certain months of the year loarie et al 2011 thus the possibility of expanding agricultural areas for the production of biofuel feedstocks in places where the rainfall regime is not favorable to the production under dry conditions is directly related to locations where water availability is not already committed and the proper management of both water resources and irrigation is essential for achieving sustainable production in view of the above this work aimed to analyze the possibility of expansion with sugarcane of potentially irrigable areas associated with the crops cultivated more in the paracatu river basin and in its main sub basins under full irrigation conditions and with deficits based on natural and potential water availability 2 material and methods 2 1 characterization of the study area the water catchment area of the paracatu river fig 1 is located in the upper middle são francisco between the geographic coordinates of 45 10 00 47 30 00 w and 15 30 00 19 30 00 s and has a drainage area greater than 4 500 000 ha the paracatu river is the tributary with the highest real contribution for the formation of the são francisco river flow contributing with approximately 18 20 pereira et al 2007 according to the köppen classification the basin presents a megathermal rainy climate of type aw characterized by a rainy tropical climate in which the rains are concentrated in the period of october to april the greater average annual precipitations occurring in the south and northwest of the basin and decreasing towards the mouth vasconcelos et al 2012 the main economic activities developed in the basin are livestock agriculture and mineral exploration rezende 2013 the main crops cultivated in the municipalities belonging to the basin are soybeans beans maize and sugarcane with the municipalities of unaí paracatu and cristalina having the largest planted areas ibge 2015 2 2 water availability the water availability wa of the study area was obtained in the study of regionalization of flow rates for the improvement of the granting process in the state of minas gerais gprh igam 2012 for the natural water availability the minimum flow with seven days of duration with probability of occurrence of ten years q7 10 was considered and for potential water availability the mean long duration flow qmld table 1 shows the equations for the three hydrologically homogeneous regions rhh of the study area homogeneous regions allow to define areas that have similar hydrologic responses i e defined as a group of stations with similar probability distribution functions of climatological and or hydrological parameters thus for a given homogeneous region records may be extrapolated more accurately nathan and mcmahon 1990 and similar water management schemes can be developed as well as agricultural production planning the wa natural and potential for each river segment was estimated by equation 1 q l o c a l q j i 1 n q l o c a l m c i 1000 where qlocal is the local flow in the river segment of interest l s 1 qj is the flow downstream of the river segment of interest m3 s 1 and qlocalm c is the local flow in the river segment upstream of the confluence with the river segment of interest m3 s 1 in the passages at the head qlocal is equal to qj the specific local flow was also calculated in each section q7 10 and qmld l s 1 ha 1 through the ratio between qlocal l s 1 and the drainage area of each river segment ha 1 2 3 flow required by irrigation of sugarcane the flows required by sugarcane irrigation were calculated for the centroids of the more than 100 pixels that covered the study area which contained daily reference evapotranspiration data et0 and precipitation for the period from january 1 1980 to december 31 2013 xavier et al 2015 for each of the centroids the average required unit flow qreq méd was estimated by means of the weighted average of the unit flows eq 2 for the seven months of planting of the crop from may to november according to information from the national supply center conab 2013 and the 2006 census of agriculture ibge 2016 for this it was assumed that the planted area would be distributed equally during these months and a five day irrigation shift was considered 2 q r e q m è d i 1 n 0 143 e t r c p e f e a 1 8 64 where qreq méd is the average required unit flow l s 1 ha 1 0 143 corresponds to the proportion of planted area in each month of planting dimensionless etrc is the actual evapotranspiration of the crop mm d 1 pef is the effective precipitation mm d 1 ea is the application efficiency dimensionless and 8 64 is the conversion factor for mm d 1 to l s 1 ha 1 etrc was obtained by equation 3 et rc x et 0 k c k s where x is the percentage of potential evapotranspiration of the crop etpc mm 1 considered in the calculation of the flow required by irrigation of sugar cane dimensionless which is equal to the product between the cultivation coefficient for the different phenological stages of the crop kc dimensionless with the 12 month life cycle table 2 and et0 and the coefficient of soil moisture ks dimensionless the ks to be considered in this work corresponds to the average between the moment when the soil is near the field capacity and at the limit of water depletion and was estimated by the equation 4 k s 1 log cad z f 1 log cad z 1 2 where cad is the available water capacity for the first meter of soil depth mm m 1 z is the depth of the crop root system m and f is the water availability factor when there is still no water stress non dimensional the cad values for the study area were obtained based on the study developed by rossato et al 2004 which were estimated through fade transfer functions based on soil characteristics such as texture overall density and organic matter content the z values for sugar cane were obtained in fao bulletin 56 and are equal to 0 65 and 1 20 m respectively allen et al 1998 in determining pef the runoff was disregarded and it was assumed that all precipitating water infiltrates the soil according to the following conditions if the daily precipitation p mm is greater than or equal to the actual water capacity in the soil cra mm which is the product between cad f and z then pef equals cra and otherwise if p is less than cra then pef is equal to p the ea considered was the top quartile of the mean of application efficiencies for the spray methods based on technical note no 364 2007 geout sof ana quoted by ana 2013 being considered equal to 87 50 this being the predominant irrigation method for sugarcane in the study area ibge 2016 considering sugarcane crop cycles with duration of 365 days and an interval of five days between each irrigation were estimated 73 values of qreq méd were estimated for each centroid of the pixels that covered the basin these values were interpolated through the inverse of distance to power idw so that at any point in the basin there was information about the water demands for irrigation of sugarcane thus generating the same amount of maps with this information this information was transferred to each part of the hydrography through the overlapping of the maps containing the qreq méd and the map with the hydrography of the basin among the 73 maps generated one was selected that presented the greatest water demand for the irrigation of the cane throughout the hydrography this period being called critical 2 4 analysis of potentially irrigable areas the analysis of the possibility of expansion of irrigated areas was made based on potentially irrigable areas pias and existing areas with sugarcane and other crops in the paracatu river basin and in some specific sections fig 2 which are called sub basins according to the coding of river basins by the method of otto pfafstetter used by the national water agency ana pias were initially calculated for each river segment based on available water for granting and on water demand for irrigation through eq 5 then the sum of the pias of the head sections was made toward the mouth of the study area piaacum 5 p i a s e g m e n t q d i s p q r e q m è d where piasegment is the pia for each river segment ha and qdisp is the flow available for granting l s 1 in the study area qdisp in the run of river wa was considered equal to 50 of q7 10 per year and the potential wa was equal to qmld 50 q7 10 annual since more than 90 of the study area is located in the state of minas gerais and according to the semad igam joint resolution no 1548 of march 29 2012 these are the values used as reference for concession granting the pias were compared to the areas already existing in the study area with sugarcane and other crops for this the information on the planted areas was obtained from ibge 2015 this information was made available for each brazilian municipality and therefore it was necessary to estimate the areas planted with cane aapc and with all cultures aapt temporary and permanent in the study area through eqs 6 and 7 respectively 6 a a p c i 1 n a m b a m a c m i where aapc is area planted with sugarcane in the study area ha am b is the area of the municipality within the area of study ha am is the total area of the municipality ha and ac m is the area planted with sugarcane in the municipality ha 7 a a p t i 1 n a m b a m a t m i where aapt is the area planted with all crops in the study area ha and at m is the area planted with all crops in the municipality ha in addition to sugarcane soybean maize and beans are also prominent in the study area silva 2014 estimated the water demands for irrigation in a sub basin of the paracatu river considering different sowing dates for rotations between maize and beans or soybeans in this way the impact of part of the planted area to be occupied by sugarcane and part of the crops in rotation against the water availability in the basin was analyzed thus in the periods when there was a simultaneous need for irrigation of sugarcane and rotating crops a new unit flow eq 8 was estimated for the water supplementation of these crops 8 q u n i m è d a q r e q m è d 1 a q i where quni méd is the average unit flow l s 1 ha 1 qi is the unit flow for the irrigation of rotating crops estimated by silva 2014 l s 1 ha 1 and a is the proportion of area planted with sugar cane dimensionless 3 results and discussion the results and discussion regarding the work are done considering full irrigation with natural and potential wa and deficit irrigation with natural wa 3 1 water availability the wa of the study area was analyzed through the potential flow qmld and natural flow q7 10 analyzing the qmld fig 3 a it was found that it varied in 75 of the river segments was greater than 0 10 and less or equal to 0 19 l s 1 ha 1 with the highest specific flow rates being concentrated in the south and northwest regions of the basin where the highest average annual rainfall ranging from 1300 to 1560 mm was also evidenced xavier et al 2015 in the river segments close to the mouth of the basin qmld tended to present lower values was greater than 0 05 and less or equal to 0 10 l s 1 ha 1 reflecting the occurrence of lower average annual rainfall in some river segments highlighted in red the qmld presented negative incremental flow rates a fact that is associated with the discontinuity of flow rates which is a limitation of the process of regionalization of flow when done by the multiple regression method leading to incremental flows null or extremely high and that do not follow the expected behavior of the precipitation regime pruski et al 2012 due to this limitation the flow rate was considered equal to zero in the sections in which a negative incremental flow was obtained the behavior of q7 10 fig 3b along the basin did not show a relationship of dependence as strong with the annual mean precipitation as that observed for the qmld this fact is associated with the formation of flows qmld is formed with the contributions of the superficial and underground flows while the q7 10 is more directly associated with the contribution of the water table novaes et al 2009 nunes and pruski 2015 another factor that may explain the behavior of q7 10 is the hydrogeological formation of the basin in the rhh i in most river segments the q7 10 was greater than 0 01 l s 1 ha 1 and less or equal to 0 02 l s 1 ha 1 and it is located in an area with a predominance of karst cracked aquifers in which there is great spatial variability of the permeability and of the infiltration capacity causing a rapid depletion of the water from the soil to the bed of the water course which can anticipate the period of recession in these areas rodrigues 2013 igam 2006 while in rhh iii values of q7 10 greater than 0 03 l s 1 ha 1 observed which occurred in an area of cretaceous aquifers that are composed of predominantly fine sandstones and which are characterized by free aquifers that provide a significant amount of water through the slope sources contributing to the formation of flows of the watercourses vasconcelos et al 2012 igam 2006 3 2 full irrigation in full irrigation the application of 100 of etpc was considered in the estimations of water demands for irrigation 3 2 1 required flow for the irrigation of sugarcane the flow rates required for irrigation of sugarcane were calculated considering a five day irrigation shift and the 12 month cycle and in the last two months of the cycle corresponding to the maturation stage it was considered that the irrigation was suspended for sugar accumulation following the recommendations of scarpare et al 2015 according to item 2 3 73 maps of qreq méd were obtained throughout the hydrography among these maps the period from september 9 13 was the one that presented the greatest water demands for the irrigation of the crop and therefore considered the most critical in terms of demands for irrigation and therefore the whole discussion of this work was based on it during the period from september 9 13 fig 4 the highest qreq méd concentrated in the river segments close to the mouth of the basin decreasing towards the northwest and south of the basin the behavior of the flow rates required along the hydrography was a reflection of the water balance in the basin in the south and northwest regions the highest annual precipitations occurred and the lowest values of et0 resulting in a lower need for water supplementation xavier et al 2015 following towards the mouth of the basin there was an increase in the water deficit and consequently the qreq méd values were higher during this same period the qreq méd occurred at the mouth of the basin and was 0 38 l s 1 ha 1 for a comparative analysis this value was compared with the values that are used in the analysis of the grant applications in the state of minas gerais according to the technical and administrative handbook on the granting of right to the use of water resources in the state of minas gerais 2010 water consumption in irrigated agriculture varies from 1 00 to 1 40 l s 1 ha 1 in this way the qreq méd estimated represented 38 of the lower limit of the values that are used by minas gerais considering the criteria used by ana according to the recommendations of the manual of technical and administrative procedures for granting the right to the use water resources of the national water agency 2013 in the determination of the flow required in the grant application project it is recommended that for irrigation of sugar cane kc mean of 1 25 be used and instead of using effective precipitation in the water balance a probable effective precipitation be used thus a required unit flow rate of 0 89 l s 1 ha 1 is obtained more than double the highest qreq méd estimated in this work for the mouth of the basin therefore the use of a unit flow represented by the average demand for irrigation can represent an expressive benefit in terms of planning and management of water resources since it is associated with values that are more representative of the average conditions of the demands in the area of the irrigation basin than those that have been practiced in irrigation projects allowing water resources to serve a greater number of users 3 2 2 analysis of potentially irrigable areas considering run of river water availability although the analysis of the possibility of expansion of the irrigated areas based on the pia of sugarcane in the study area considering run of river water availability be of more appropriate application on a macroscale the individualized analysis was done for each river segment and then a larger scale was analyzed this analysis was made considering two conditions a the dates of sowing of maize beans and soybeans most practiced by the irrigators located in the study area and b the dates of sowing of these crops considered the most critical in relation to water demand 3 2 2 1 most commonly used sowing dates according to the association of support to producers of entre ribeiros aaper the most frequently used sowing dates currently used by irrigators correspond to the rotation plan in which maize sowing occurs in early february and bean soybean at the beginning of october it was noticed that in the most critical period of the sugarcane cycle there is no need for water supplementation of the rotating crops fig 5 and therefore it was considered that all the available water for granting was destined only for the irrigation of the cane neglecting the other users of water in the basin in the periods in which water demands for irrigation occurred for both the rotating and the cane crops simultaneously the maximum quni méd occurred at the end of april being estimated at 0 37 l s 1 ha 1 a value very close to the maximum qreq méd estimated for sugarcane in the vicinity of the mouth of the basin fig 5 in the most critical period during the sugarcane cycle in terms of water demand for irrigation for the rotation plan between maize and soybean the behavior of the average unit flow rates between these two crops and the cane was similar to the plan of rotation between corn and beans with the maximum unit flow being average it was evidenced that due to the proximity between the maximum estimated unit demand for sugarcane near the mouth of the basin and between the higher unit flow evidenced during the rotation of maize and soybean crops it can be concluded that these flows did not suffer significant changes the variations being associated only with their period of occurrence thus in terms of water demands for irrigation it would not make any difference whether the area is occupied by only one crop or all of them simultaneously therefore analyzes of piaacum were made considering that first the entire area was occupied by sugarcane and then considering part of the area with sugarcane and part with the simultaneous cultivation of the other crops the piaacum estimated at the mouth of the basin fig 6 disregarding the other user segments was approximately 120 370 ha which corresponded to 2 70 of the drainage area of the paracatu river basin in 2015 the estimated area of sugarcane planted in the basin was 50 000 ha and considering that the whole area was occupied with sugarcane cultivation and that it was irrigated it would still be possible to increase it to 140 when considering the simultaneous irrigation of sugarcane and other crops it would be enough to supply only 21 of the area planted in the basin considering that all crops are irrigated the same analysis was carried out for the eight main sub basins of the paracatu river table 3 it was observed that in seven of them the maximum allowable flow for granting is insufficient to meet the existing irrigation demands the most critical sub basins in terms of supply of crop water needs are the preto river 7484 and ribeirão entre ribeiros 7486 which already have a high water demand for irrigation since they are partly in the municipalities of paracatu and unaí that are among the largest grain producers in minas gerais ibge 2015 only in the lower paracatu 7481 would it be possible to supply the irrigation demands with the possibility of expansion into 23 of the existing planted area thus it is evident that the consideration of 50 of q7 10 was not enough to supply all the irrigation needs of the planted area in seven sub basins which characterizes the need to regularize flows to meet these demands and the demands associated with the other user segments 3 2 2 2 most critical sowing dates the condition regarding the cultivation schedule considered by silva 2014 as the most critical in terms of water demand for irrigation corresponds to the rotation plan in which maize sowing occurs at the beginning of may and bean soybean at the beginning of january it was observed that during the entire corn crop cycle there was a need for water supplementation in the same periods in which the sugar cane water deficits occurred and the maximum average unit flow occurred in the third week of july and was equal to 0 41 l s 1 ha 1 fig 7 during the period from september 9 13 the average unit flow rate between corn and sugarcane was 0 36 l s 1 ha 1 this flow therefore being near the maximum qreq méd estimated for sugarcane 0 38 l s 1 ha 1 in the same period therefore it is evident that in the most critical crop calendar there is an increase of almost 10 in average unit flow which happens in the third week of july compared to the flow in the most critical period of sugarcane accordingly by applying the legislation in force in the state of minas gerais igam 2010 which considers the maximum grantable flow equal to 50 of annual q7 10 this increase in demand for irrigation would have an impact of almost 10 on the pia estimated from september 9 13 3 2 3 analysis of potentially irrigable areas considering the regulated availability of water considering that run of river water availability represented by 50 of q7 10 was insufficient to even meet the demands of irrigation in the paracatu river basin the analysis was done of how much irrigation was possible using the maximum possible water availability to be regulated considering that this availability was destined only for irrigation use during the period when the maximum water demand for sugarcane irrigation was estimated from september 9 13 and based on the sowing dates most practiced by irrigators the pia in the basin was higher than 1 50 million ha corresponding to 35 of the drainage area of the basin and about 1200 higher than the piaacum estimated for the same period considering run of river water availability thus regulated water availability could permit expansion of the area occupied by sugarcane in the basin in 2015 by up to 30 times assuming that the entire pia estimated in the mouth of the basin was occupied only by cane considering the other crops present in the basin there would be a potential for expansion of up to 170 the water supplementation needs of the crops being supplied through the use of full irrigation in the eight sub basins analyzed table 3 the consideration of full regulation in water availability allows irrigation of 19 95 44 56 of the drainage area of each one where the highest percentages were obtained in the regions with the highest qmld and the smallest water deficits the increase of piaacum values in relation to the areas estimated as a function of run of river wa is directly related to the higher water availability due to the regulation of flow rates as was observed in a study carried out in the ribeirão entre ribeiros sub basin 7486 in the mentioned study it was evidenced that the substitution of the criterion of concessions by the run of river conditions with the criterion corresponding to the regulated condition of flow would result in an increase of 1390 to 1610 in the wa of the sub basin nunes and pruski 2015 in the eight sub basins besides supplying the existing demands with full irrigation it would be possible to expand them by at least 48 the two sub basins with the least expansion possibilities of the planted areas are those of preto river 7484 and ribeirão entre ribeiro 7486 these two sub basins already have high water demands for irrigation due to the existence of large planted areas and in the driest period of 2014 just the municipalities of unaí and paracatu which belong to these two sub basins possessed an area irrigated by central pivot of almost 121 000 ha ana 2016 thus it is evident that the use of flow regulation is an important tool for the management of water resources in the basin since in addition to minimizing conflicts already existing among water users it also allows the expansion of irrigated agriculture throughout the basin however the construction of reservoirs generates impacts at the environmental and social levels and therefore careful studies should be carried out at the implementation locations 3 3 irrigation with deficit the application of deficit irrigation was simulated only for sugarcane and consisted in the reduction of etpc in the calculation of water demands for irrigation this reduction was based on the study developed by caixeta 2013 in the alto paranaíba region in the brazilian state of minas gerais where it was found that in order to avoid statistically reducing crop productivity etpc of at least 75 should be considered in the estimation of water demands for irrigation 3 3 1 flow required for irrigation of sugarcane the qreq méd values in irrigation with deficits were estimated for each period of five days during the entire crop cycle for each of these periods deficits corresponding to 25 20 or 10 were applied in the estimates of the demands for the irrigation of sugarcane in the period that the greatest demand in full irrigation occurred the maximum reduction of etpc 25 was applied and qreq méd recalculated for this period if the other estimated demands on full irrigation exceeded the calculated flow with a 25 reduction in etpc then they would be recalculated with reduction in 10 20 and 25 of etpc and the highest flow among the three estimates that did not exceed the flow recalculated for the most critical period was considered in the same way as in full irrigation the period from september 9 13 had the highest qreq méd throughout the hydrography in deficit irrigation for this period the 25 reduction of etpc implied an average reduction of 22 in demands for irrigation compared to those estimated with 100 of etpc thus these flow rates ranged from 0 19 to 0 28 l s 1 ha 1 and the behavior was similar to that discussed for full irrigation 3 3 2 analysis of potentially irrigable areas considering run of river water availability on the water similar to full irrigation deficit irrigation analysis of the possibility of expansion of irrigated areas was also done initially for each river segment and later it was done on a macroscale this analysis was made considering two conditions a the expansion of sugarcane only and b the dates of sowing of maize beans and soybeans most practiced by irrigators located in the study area 3 3 2 1 expansion of areas with sugarcane during the period from september 9 13 the pia considering the application of 75 of etpc in the mouth of the basin was estimated at approximately 165 402 ha representing an increase of 37 in relation to piaacum obtained with full irrigation and therefore equivalent to 3 60 of the drainage area of the paracatu river basin thus the utilization of run of river wa associated with the use of deficit irrigation makes it possible to supply the more than 50 000 ha of sugarcane that were estimated in the paracatu river basin and there is also the potential to expand it by approximately 230 3 3 2 2 most commonly used sowing dates as regards the dates of sowing relative to the rotation plan between maize and bean soybean crops that are more frequently used by irrigators it was noted that when there is a need for water supplementation of rotating crops and sugarcane at the same time the most critical period of sugarcane ceases to occur in september as it was in full irrigation and occurs in the period from april 21 25 thus the application of the maximum water deficit 75 of etpc in the estimation of demand for irrigation of sugarcane occurred first in the period from april 21 25 for example in the vicinity of the mouth of the paracatu river basin a mean unit flow rate equal to 0 32 l s 1 ha 1 considering that 50 of the planted area was occupied by sugarcane and 50 by the crops in rotation during the period from april 21 25 the piaacum in the mouth of the basin was estimated at 151 491 ha representing an increase of 19 in relation to piaacum obtained for the same period with full irrigation and thus equivalent to 3 4 of the drainage area of the paracatu river basin at the sub basin level the use of deficit irrigation made it possible to irrigate from 2 37 to 4 02 of the drainage areas of each of the sub basins with the highest percentages being related to sites with higher water availability and with lower water deficits the association of deficit irrigation and run of river wa would make it possible to supply water demands for irrigation in all areas planted in sub basins baixo paracatu 7481 and rio do sono 7482 table 3 which have a minimum expansion potential of 8 in the other sub basins the water availability represented by 50 of q7 10 is insufficient to meet the water demands of existing planted areas thus it is noted that the use of deficit irrigation alone is not enough to meet the water demands from irrigating the existing areas in six sub basins of the paracatu river however the fact that the critical period for sugarcane associated with rotating crops occurs in a period with higher run of river wa means that with the adoption of seasonal wa it is possible to overcome the impacts arising from the increase of demands for irrigation and also for the other user segments 4 conclusions in the present work it was concluded that the natural wa allowed for granting was insufficient to meet the water demands of the planted areas considering all the cultures present in the basin both in full irrigation and also in irrigation with deficit and when considered the potential wa was able to meet all the water demands of the crops currently planted and also allows a potential of 170 expansion of this area acknowledgments thanks to the coordination of improvement

11476,in the face of population growth and the consequent increase in water and energy consumption coupled with concern about climate change society has sought renewable energy sources such as biofuels brazil has excelled in the production of ethanol using sugarcane as its raw material and in recent years there has been an advance in sugarcane production towards the brazilian cerrado due to the existence of suitable areas and the availability of water to expand irrigated agriculture recognizing this we sought to analyze the potential for expansion of the planted areas in the paracatu river basin under full and deficit conditions of irrigation and both natural and potential water availability potential irrigation areas pias were estimated as a function of the average required unit flow rates for sugarcane irrigation and water availability according to the criteria for granting concessions in the state of minas gerais which were compared to the areas currently planted with sugarcane and with all crops in a macro scale analysis considering that the water available is only for irrigation and that it is the only restrictive factor for the expansion of the agricultural areas based on the minimum annual flow it would be possible to irrigate in the paracatu river basin more than 120 000 ha indicating that the water demands could be supplied in 21 of the planted areas already existing in the basin which could be increased by up to 19 by the use of deficit irrigation with the availability of water potential it would be possible to supply the water demands of the entire area planted with permanent and temporary crops and there is also the possibility of expansion into up to 170 of these areas keywords water resource biofuels sustainability 1 introduction the increase in the per capita consumption of essential inputs such as water and energy coupled with growing concern about climate change has made society increasingly seek sources of renewable energy as an alternative for reducing oil consumption fargione et al 2008 silva et al 2011 lourenzani et al 2016 renewable sources include biofuels mainly produced by oilseeds and sugarcane thus increasing the search for areas suitable for planting these crops brazil has been considered a great power for the expansion of biofuel production without compromising food production since there are agricultural areas suitable for the production of the raw material with favorable edaphoclimatic conditions and relative abundance in water resources and in addition the country has the technology and labor highlighting it in the international market nass et al 2007 goldemberg et al 2008 lourenzani et al 2016 due to these characteristics among the raw materials for the production of biofuels brazil has been outstanding in the production of soybeans corn and sugarcane among the three crops cited sugarcane is the third temporary crop in terms of area occupation but nonetheless the country has stood out in the production of ethanol using it as raw material that is also used in sugar production and animal feed mainly due to the photosynthetic conversion of sugarcane which allows productivity well above other crops in 2015 brazil produced about 30 billion liters of ethanol and it was estimated that in the 2016 17 crop the production could exceed this value epe 2015 conab 2016 sugarcane production in brazil started in the northeast region and today is concentrated in the center south region due to the favorable climatic conditions for its production however in the search for new areas for cane production in recent years there has been an advance of the agricultural frontier toward the brazilian cerrado owing to the greater availability of water and the existence of areas suitable for sugarcane cultivation even if precipitation is concentrated in certain months of the year loarie et al 2011 thus the possibility of expanding agricultural areas for the production of biofuel feedstocks in places where the rainfall regime is not favorable to the production under dry conditions is directly related to locations where water availability is not already committed and the proper management of both water resources and irrigation is essential for achieving sustainable production in view of the above this work aimed to analyze the possibility of expansion with sugarcane of potentially irrigable areas associated with the crops cultivated more in the paracatu river basin and in its main sub basins under full irrigation conditions and with deficits based on natural and potential water availability 2 material and methods 2 1 characterization of the study area the water catchment area of the paracatu river fig 1 is located in the upper middle são francisco between the geographic coordinates of 45 10 00 47 30 00 w and 15 30 00 19 30 00 s and has a drainage area greater than 4 500 000 ha the paracatu river is the tributary with the highest real contribution for the formation of the são francisco river flow contributing with approximately 18 20 pereira et al 2007 according to the köppen classification the basin presents a megathermal rainy climate of type aw characterized by a rainy tropical climate in which the rains are concentrated in the period of october to april the greater average annual precipitations occurring in the south and northwest of the basin and decreasing towards the mouth vasconcelos et al 2012 the main economic activities developed in the basin are livestock agriculture and mineral exploration rezende 2013 the main crops cultivated in the municipalities belonging to the basin are soybeans beans maize and sugarcane with the municipalities of unaí paracatu and cristalina having the largest planted areas ibge 2015 2 2 water availability the water availability wa of the study area was obtained in the study of regionalization of flow rates for the improvement of the granting process in the state of minas gerais gprh igam 2012 for the natural water availability the minimum flow with seven days of duration with probability of occurrence of ten years q7 10 was considered and for potential water availability the mean long duration flow qmld table 1 shows the equations for the three hydrologically homogeneous regions rhh of the study area homogeneous regions allow to define areas that have similar hydrologic responses i e defined as a group of stations with similar probability distribution functions of climatological and or hydrological parameters thus for a given homogeneous region records may be extrapolated more accurately nathan and mcmahon 1990 and similar water management schemes can be developed as well as agricultural production planning the wa natural and potential for each river segment was estimated by equation 1 q l o c a l q j i 1 n q l o c a l m c i 1000 where qlocal is the local flow in the river segment of interest l s 1 qj is the flow downstream of the river segment of interest m3 s 1 and qlocalm c is the local flow in the river segment upstream of the confluence with the river segment of interest m3 s 1 in the passages at the head qlocal is equal to qj the specific local flow was also calculated in each section q7 10 and qmld l s 1 ha 1 through the ratio between qlocal l s 1 and the drainage area of each river segment ha 1 2 3 flow required by irrigation of sugarcane the flows required by sugarcane irrigation were calculated for the centroids of the more than 100 pixels that covered the study area which contained daily reference evapotranspiration data et0 and precipitation for the period from january 1 1980 to december 31 2013 xavier et al 2015 for each of the centroids the average required unit flow qreq méd was estimated by means of the weighted average of the unit flows eq 2 for the seven months of planting of the crop from may to november according to information from the national supply center conab 2013 and the 2006 census of agriculture ibge 2016 for this it was assumed that the planted area would be distributed equally during these months and a five day irrigation shift was considered 2 q r e q m è d i 1 n 0 143 e t r c p e f e a 1 8 64 where qreq méd is the average required unit flow l s 1 ha 1 0 143 corresponds to the proportion of planted area in each month of planting dimensionless etrc is the actual evapotranspiration of the crop mm d 1 pef is the effective precipitation mm d 1 ea is the application efficiency dimensionless and 8 64 is the conversion factor for mm d 1 to l s 1 ha 1 etrc was obtained by equation 3 et rc x et 0 k c k s where x is the percentage of potential evapotranspiration of the crop etpc mm 1 considered in the calculation of the flow required by irrigation of sugar cane dimensionless which is equal to the product between the cultivation coefficient for the different phenological stages of the crop kc dimensionless with the 12 month life cycle table 2 and et0 and the coefficient of soil moisture ks dimensionless the ks to be considered in this work corresponds to the average between the moment when the soil is near the field capacity and at the limit of water depletion and was estimated by the equation 4 k s 1 log cad z f 1 log cad z 1 2 where cad is the available water capacity for the first meter of soil depth mm m 1 z is the depth of the crop root system m and f is the water availability factor when there is still no water stress non dimensional the cad values for the study area were obtained based on the study developed by rossato et al 2004 which were estimated through fade transfer functions based on soil characteristics such as texture overall density and organic matter content the z values for sugar cane were obtained in fao bulletin 56 and are equal to 0 65 and 1 20 m respectively allen et al 1998 in determining pef the runoff was disregarded and it was assumed that all precipitating water infiltrates the soil according to the following conditions if the daily precipitation p mm is greater than or equal to the actual water capacity in the soil cra mm which is the product between cad f and z then pef equals cra and otherwise if p is less than cra then pef is equal to p the ea considered was the top quartile of the mean of application efficiencies for the spray methods based on technical note no 364 2007 geout sof ana quoted by ana 2013 being considered equal to 87 50 this being the predominant irrigation method for sugarcane in the study area ibge 2016 considering sugarcane crop cycles with duration of 365 days and an interval of five days between each irrigation were estimated 73 values of qreq méd were estimated for each centroid of the pixels that covered the basin these values were interpolated through the inverse of distance to power idw so that at any point in the basin there was information about the water demands for irrigation of sugarcane thus generating the same amount of maps with this information this information was transferred to each part of the hydrography through the overlapping of the maps containing the qreq méd and the map with the hydrography of the basin among the 73 maps generated one was selected that presented the greatest water demand for the irrigation of the cane throughout the hydrography this period being called critical 2 4 analysis of potentially irrigable areas the analysis of the possibility of expansion of irrigated areas was made based on potentially irrigable areas pias and existing areas with sugarcane and other crops in the paracatu river basin and in some specific sections fig 2 which are called sub basins according to the coding of river basins by the method of otto pfafstetter used by the national water agency ana pias were initially calculated for each river segment based on available water for granting and on water demand for irrigation through eq 5 then the sum of the pias of the head sections was made toward the mouth of the study area piaacum 5 p i a s e g m e n t q d i s p q r e q m è d where piasegment is the pia for each river segment ha and qdisp is the flow available for granting l s 1 in the study area qdisp in the run of river wa was considered equal to 50 of q7 10 per year and the potential wa was equal to qmld 50 q7 10 annual since more than 90 of the study area is located in the state of minas gerais and according to the semad igam joint resolution no 1548 of march 29 2012 these are the values used as reference for concession granting the pias were compared to the areas already existing in the study area with sugarcane and other crops for this the information on the planted areas was obtained from ibge 2015 this information was made available for each brazilian municipality and therefore it was necessary to estimate the areas planted with cane aapc and with all cultures aapt temporary and permanent in the study area through eqs 6 and 7 respectively 6 a a p c i 1 n a m b a m a c m i where aapc is area planted with sugarcane in the study area ha am b is the area of the municipality within the area of study ha am is the total area of the municipality ha and ac m is the area planted with sugarcane in the municipality ha 7 a a p t i 1 n a m b a m a t m i where aapt is the area planted with all crops in the study area ha and at m is the area planted with all crops in the municipality ha in addition to sugarcane soybean maize and beans are also prominent in the study area silva 2014 estimated the water demands for irrigation in a sub basin of the paracatu river considering different sowing dates for rotations between maize and beans or soybeans in this way the impact of part of the planted area to be occupied by sugarcane and part of the crops in rotation against the water availability in the basin was analyzed thus in the periods when there was a simultaneous need for irrigation of sugarcane and rotating crops a new unit flow eq 8 was estimated for the water supplementation of these crops 8 q u n i m è d a q r e q m è d 1 a q i where quni méd is the average unit flow l s 1 ha 1 qi is the unit flow for the irrigation of rotating crops estimated by silva 2014 l s 1 ha 1 and a is the proportion of area planted with sugar cane dimensionless 3 results and discussion the results and discussion regarding the work are done considering full irrigation with natural and potential wa and deficit irrigation with natural wa 3 1 water availability the wa of the study area was analyzed through the potential flow qmld and natural flow q7 10 analyzing the qmld fig 3 a it was found that it varied in 75 of the river segments was greater than 0 10 and less or equal to 0 19 l s 1 ha 1 with the highest specific flow rates being concentrated in the south and northwest regions of the basin where the highest average annual rainfall ranging from 1300 to 1560 mm was also evidenced xavier et al 2015 in the river segments close to the mouth of the basin qmld tended to present lower values was greater than 0 05 and less or equal to 0 10 l s 1 ha 1 reflecting the occurrence of lower average annual rainfall in some river segments highlighted in red the qmld presented negative incremental flow rates a fact that is associated with the discontinuity of flow rates which is a limitation of the process of regionalization of flow when done by the multiple regression method leading to incremental flows null or extremely high and that do not follow the expected behavior of the precipitation regime pruski et al 2012 due to this limitation the flow rate was considered equal to zero in the sections in which a negative incremental flow was obtained the behavior of q7 10 fig 3b along the basin did not show a relationship of dependence as strong with the annual mean precipitation as that observed for the qmld this fact is associated with the formation of flows qmld is formed with the contributions of the superficial and underground flows while the q7 10 is more directly associated with the contribution of the water table novaes et al 2009 nunes and pruski 2015 another factor that may explain the behavior of q7 10 is the hydrogeological formation of the basin in the rhh i in most river segments the q7 10 was greater than 0 01 l s 1 ha 1 and less or equal to 0 02 l s 1 ha 1 and it is located in an area with a predominance of karst cracked aquifers in which there is great spatial variability of the permeability and of the infiltration capacity causing a rapid depletion of the water from the soil to the bed of the water course which can anticipate the period of recession in these areas rodrigues 2013 igam 2006 while in rhh iii values of q7 10 greater than 0 03 l s 1 ha 1 observed which occurred in an area of cretaceous aquifers that are composed of predominantly fine sandstones and which are characterized by free aquifers that provide a significant amount of water through the slope sources contributing to the formation of flows of the watercourses vasconcelos et al 2012 igam 2006 3 2 full irrigation in full irrigation the application of 100 of etpc was considered in the estimations of water demands for irrigation 3 2 1 required flow for the irrigation of sugarcane the flow rates required for irrigation of sugarcane were calculated considering a five day irrigation shift and the 12 month cycle and in the last two months of the cycle corresponding to the maturation stage it was considered that the irrigation was suspended for sugar accumulation following the recommendations of scarpare et al 2015 according to item 2 3 73 maps of qreq méd were obtained throughout the hydrography among these maps the period from september 9 13 was the one that presented the greatest water demands for the irrigation of the crop and therefore considered the most critical in terms of demands for irrigation and therefore the whole discussion of this work was based on it during the period from september 9 13 fig 4 the highest qreq méd concentrated in the river segments close to the mouth of the basin decreasing towards the northwest and south of the basin the behavior of the flow rates required along the hydrography was a reflection of the water balance in the basin in the south and northwest regions the highest annual precipitations occurred and the lowest values of et0 resulting in a lower need for water supplementation xavier et al 2015 following towards the mouth of the basin there was an increase in the water deficit and consequently the qreq méd values were higher during this same period the qreq méd occurred at the mouth of the basin and was 0 38 l s 1 ha 1 for a comparative analysis this value was compared with the values that are used in the analysis of the grant applications in the state of minas gerais according to the technical and administrative handbook on the granting of right to the use of water resources in the state of minas gerais 2010 water consumption in irrigated agriculture varies from 1 00 to 1 40 l s 1 ha 1 in this way the qreq méd estimated represented 38 of the lower limit of the values that are used by minas gerais considering the criteria used by ana according to the recommendations of the manual of technical and administrative procedures for granting the right to the use water resources of the national water agency 2013 in the determination of the flow required in the grant application project it is recommended that for irrigation of sugar cane kc mean of 1 25 be used and instead of using effective precipitation in the water balance a probable effective precipitation be used thus a required unit flow rate of 0 89 l s 1 ha 1 is obtained more than double the highest qreq méd estimated in this work for the mouth of the basin therefore the use of a unit flow represented by the average demand for irrigation can represent an expressive benefit in terms of planning and management of water resources since it is associated with values that are more representative of the average conditions of the demands in the area of the irrigation basin than those that have been practiced in irrigation projects allowing water resources to serve a greater number of users 3 2 2 analysis of potentially irrigable areas considering run of river water availability although the analysis of the possibility of expansion of the irrigated areas based on the pia of sugarcane in the study area considering run of river water availability be of more appropriate application on a macroscale the individualized analysis was done for each river segment and then a larger scale was analyzed this analysis was made considering two conditions a the dates of sowing of maize beans and soybeans most practiced by the irrigators located in the study area and b the dates of sowing of these crops considered the most critical in relation to water demand 3 2 2 1 most commonly used sowing dates according to the association of support to producers of entre ribeiros aaper the most frequently used sowing dates currently used by irrigators correspond to the rotation plan in which maize sowing occurs in early february and bean soybean at the beginning of october it was noticed that in the most critical period of the sugarcane cycle there is no need for water supplementation of the rotating crops fig 5 and therefore it was considered that all the available water for granting was destined only for the irrigation of the cane neglecting the other users of water in the basin in the periods in which water demands for irrigation occurred for both the rotating and the cane crops simultaneously the maximum quni méd occurred at the end of april being estimated at 0 37 l s 1 ha 1 a value very close to the maximum qreq méd estimated for sugarcane in the vicinity of the mouth of the basin fig 5 in the most critical period during the sugarcane cycle in terms of water demand for irrigation for the rotation plan between maize and soybean the behavior of the average unit flow rates between these two crops and the cane was similar to the plan of rotation between corn and beans with the maximum unit flow being average it was evidenced that due to the proximity between the maximum estimated unit demand for sugarcane near the mouth of the basin and between the higher unit flow evidenced during the rotation of maize and soybean crops it can be concluded that these flows did not suffer significant changes the variations being associated only with their period of occurrence thus in terms of water demands for irrigation it would not make any difference whether the area is occupied by only one crop or all of them simultaneously therefore analyzes of piaacum were made considering that first the entire area was occupied by sugarcane and then considering part of the area with sugarcane and part with the simultaneous cultivation of the other crops the piaacum estimated at the mouth of the basin fig 6 disregarding the other user segments was approximately 120 370 ha which corresponded to 2 70 of the drainage area of the paracatu river basin in 2015 the estimated area of sugarcane planted in the basin was 50 000 ha and considering that the whole area was occupied with sugarcane cultivation and that it was irrigated it would still be possible to increase it to 140 when considering the simultaneous irrigation of sugarcane and other crops it would be enough to supply only 21 of the area planted in the basin considering that all crops are irrigated the same analysis was carried out for the eight main sub basins of the paracatu river table 3 it was observed that in seven of them the maximum allowable flow for granting is insufficient to meet the existing irrigation demands the most critical sub basins in terms of supply of crop water needs are the preto river 7484 and ribeirão entre ribeiros 7486 which already have a high water demand for irrigation since they are partly in the municipalities of paracatu and unaí that are among the largest grain producers in minas gerais ibge 2015 only in the lower paracatu 7481 would it be possible to supply the irrigation demands with the possibility of expansion into 23 of the existing planted area thus it is evident that the consideration of 50 of q7 10 was not enough to supply all the irrigation needs of the planted area in seven sub basins which characterizes the need to regularize flows to meet these demands and the demands associated with the other user segments 3 2 2 2 most critical sowing dates the condition regarding the cultivation schedule considered by silva 2014 as the most critical in terms of water demand for irrigation corresponds to the rotation plan in which maize sowing occurs at the beginning of may and bean soybean at the beginning of january it was observed that during the entire corn crop cycle there was a need for water supplementation in the same periods in which the sugar cane water deficits occurred and the maximum average unit flow occurred in the third week of july and was equal to 0 41 l s 1 ha 1 fig 7 during the period from september 9 13 the average unit flow rate between corn and sugarcane was 0 36 l s 1 ha 1 this flow therefore being near the maximum qreq méd estimated for sugarcane 0 38 l s 1 ha 1 in the same period therefore it is evident that in the most critical crop calendar there is an increase of almost 10 in average unit flow which happens in the third week of july compared to the flow in the most critical period of sugarcane accordingly by applying the legislation in force in the state of minas gerais igam 2010 which considers the maximum grantable flow equal to 50 of annual q7 10 this increase in demand for irrigation would have an impact of almost 10 on the pia estimated from september 9 13 3 2 3 analysis of potentially irrigable areas considering the regulated availability of water considering that run of river water availability represented by 50 of q7 10 was insufficient to even meet the demands of irrigation in the paracatu river basin the analysis was done of how much irrigation was possible using the maximum possible water availability to be regulated considering that this availability was destined only for irrigation use during the period when the maximum water demand for sugarcane irrigation was estimated from september 9 13 and based on the sowing dates most practiced by irrigators the pia in the basin was higher than 1 50 million ha corresponding to 35 of the drainage area of the basin and about 1200 higher than the piaacum estimated for the same period considering run of river water availability thus regulated water availability could permit expansion of the area occupied by sugarcane in the basin in 2015 by up to 30 times assuming that the entire pia estimated in the mouth of the basin was occupied only by cane considering the other crops present in the basin there would be a potential for expansion of up to 170 the water supplementation needs of the crops being supplied through the use of full irrigation in the eight sub basins analyzed table 3 the consideration of full regulation in water availability allows irrigation of 19 95 44 56 of the drainage area of each one where the highest percentages were obtained in the regions with the highest qmld and the smallest water deficits the increase of piaacum values in relation to the areas estimated as a function of run of river wa is directly related to the higher water availability due to the regulation of flow rates as was observed in a study carried out in the ribeirão entre ribeiros sub basin 7486 in the mentioned study it was evidenced that the substitution of the criterion of concessions by the run of river conditions with the criterion corresponding to the regulated condition of flow would result in an increase of 1390 to 1610 in the wa of the sub basin nunes and pruski 2015 in the eight sub basins besides supplying the existing demands with full irrigation it would be possible to expand them by at least 48 the two sub basins with the least expansion possibilities of the planted areas are those of preto river 7484 and ribeirão entre ribeiro 7486 these two sub basins already have high water demands for irrigation due to the existence of large planted areas and in the driest period of 2014 just the municipalities of unaí and paracatu which belong to these two sub basins possessed an area irrigated by central pivot of almost 121 000 ha ana 2016 thus it is evident that the use of flow regulation is an important tool for the management of water resources in the basin since in addition to minimizing conflicts already existing among water users it also allows the expansion of irrigated agriculture throughout the basin however the construction of reservoirs generates impacts at the environmental and social levels and therefore careful studies should be carried out at the implementation locations 3 3 irrigation with deficit the application of deficit irrigation was simulated only for sugarcane and consisted in the reduction of etpc in the calculation of water demands for irrigation this reduction was based on the study developed by caixeta 2013 in the alto paranaíba region in the brazilian state of minas gerais where it was found that in order to avoid statistically reducing crop productivity etpc of at least 75 should be considered in the estimation of water demands for irrigation 3 3 1 flow required for irrigation of sugarcane the qreq méd values in irrigation with deficits were estimated for each period of five days during the entire crop cycle for each of these periods deficits corresponding to 25 20 or 10 were applied in the estimates of the demands for the irrigation of sugarcane in the period that the greatest demand in full irrigation occurred the maximum reduction of etpc 25 was applied and qreq méd recalculated for this period if the other estimated demands on full irrigation exceeded the calculated flow with a 25 reduction in etpc then they would be recalculated with reduction in 10 20 and 25 of etpc and the highest flow among the three estimates that did not exceed the flow recalculated for the most critical period was considered in the same way as in full irrigation the period from september 9 13 had the highest qreq méd throughout the hydrography in deficit irrigation for this period the 25 reduction of etpc implied an average reduction of 22 in demands for irrigation compared to those estimated with 100 of etpc thus these flow rates ranged from 0 19 to 0 28 l s 1 ha 1 and the behavior was similar to that discussed for full irrigation 3 3 2 analysis of potentially irrigable areas considering run of river water availability on the water similar to full irrigation deficit irrigation analysis of the possibility of expansion of irrigated areas was also done initially for each river segment and later it was done on a macroscale this analysis was made considering two conditions a the expansion of sugarcane only and b the dates of sowing of maize beans and soybeans most practiced by irrigators located in the study area 3 3 2 1 expansion of areas with sugarcane during the period from september 9 13 the pia considering the application of 75 of etpc in the mouth of the basin was estimated at approximately 165 402 ha representing an increase of 37 in relation to piaacum obtained with full irrigation and therefore equivalent to 3 60 of the drainage area of the paracatu river basin thus the utilization of run of river wa associated with the use of deficit irrigation makes it possible to supply the more than 50 000 ha of sugarcane that were estimated in the paracatu river basin and there is also the potential to expand it by approximately 230 3 3 2 2 most commonly used sowing dates as regards the dates of sowing relative to the rotation plan between maize and bean soybean crops that are more frequently used by irrigators it was noted that when there is a need for water supplementation of rotating crops and sugarcane at the same time the most critical period of sugarcane ceases to occur in september as it was in full irrigation and occurs in the period from april 21 25 thus the application of the maximum water deficit 75 of etpc in the estimation of demand for irrigation of sugarcane occurred first in the period from april 21 25 for example in the vicinity of the mouth of the paracatu river basin a mean unit flow rate equal to 0 32 l s 1 ha 1 considering that 50 of the planted area was occupied by sugarcane and 50 by the crops in rotation during the period from april 21 25 the piaacum in the mouth of the basin was estimated at 151 491 ha representing an increase of 19 in relation to piaacum obtained for the same period with full irrigation and thus equivalent to 3 4 of the drainage area of the paracatu river basin at the sub basin level the use of deficit irrigation made it possible to irrigate from 2 37 to 4 02 of the drainage areas of each of the sub basins with the highest percentages being related to sites with higher water availability and with lower water deficits the association of deficit irrigation and run of river wa would make it possible to supply water demands for irrigation in all areas planted in sub basins baixo paracatu 7481 and rio do sono 7482 table 3 which have a minimum expansion potential of 8 in the other sub basins the water availability represented by 50 of q7 10 is insufficient to meet the water demands of existing planted areas thus it is noted that the use of deficit irrigation alone is not enough to meet the water demands from irrigating the existing areas in six sub basins of the paracatu river however the fact that the critical period for sugarcane associated with rotating crops occurs in a period with higher run of river wa means that with the adoption of seasonal wa it is possible to overcome the impacts arising from the increase of demands for irrigation and also for the other user segments 4 conclusions in the present work it was concluded that the natural wa allowed for granting was insufficient to meet the water demands of the planted areas considering all the cultures present in the basin both in full irrigation and also in irrigation with deficit and when considered the potential wa was able to meet all the water demands of the crops currently planted and also allows a potential of 170 expansion of this area acknowledgments thanks to the coordination of improvement

11477,marginal quality saline sodic water will be important for agricultural production in water limited environments and has been demonstrated as suitable for irrigation on a soil specific basis suitability is usually demonstrated as the threshold electrolyte concentration cth defined as a 10 20 reduction in saturated hydraulic conductivity others have suggested that the aggregate dispersion boundary may be used as this threshold which is also known as the threshold turbidity concentration ctu using a saturated hydraulic conductivity approach this work sought to quantify the extent of reduction at the ctu and compare this to traditional cth approaches to define the practicality of the thresholds the ctu was determined as the point where dispersed clay was detected and subsequently compared to the cth with the difference between these compared within the measured domain the reduction in saturated hydraulic conductivity from a ca dominant stable condition was determined at each threshold value it was found that saturated hydraulic conductivity at the ctu reduced by between 44 and 78 for the five vertisol soils investigated demonstrating that the ctu varied between soils and was substantially more than the 10 20 reduction in hydraulic conductivity at the cth discussion on application of these thresholds to practical irrigation is provided and suggests that irrigation water quality application can be optimised on a soil specific basis results reinforce that management guidelines should not be based on the ctu or at the aggregation dispersion boundary keywords dispersion sodicity salinity soil structure 1 introduction worldwide marginal quality saline sodic mqss water is becoming an increasingly important component of agricultural water supplies particularly in water scarce countries qadir et al 2007 though mqss water could be a strategic resource there is risk and concern regarding the potential to degrade soil properties such as permeability through long term application use of such marginal quality waters can have strong effects on the levels of both soluble and exchangeable cations in a soil that lead to soil structural deterioration and salt accumulation bennett et al 2016b rengasamy and marchuk 2011 sumner 1993 therefore practical guidelines to inform about its strategic use or otherwise are needed while it is generally agreed that soils undergo reduction in saturated hydraulic conductivity rksat prior to dispersion occurring the extent of this reduction and its relation to the threshold electrolyte

the absolute stable state of soils in a ca system they went on to define a somewhat arbitrary but measureable rksat of 10 from this potential minima to represent the cth this is described as occurring at an electrolyte concentration ec approximately one quarter of that where dispersion was first observed for the same sodium adsorption ratio sar the point where dispersed clay first appeares is assumed to be the aggregate dispersion boundary condition which will be defined by a specific electrolyte concentration for a given sar quirk and schofield 1955 define this specific electrolyte

dislocates clay particles as a result of repulsive pressures overcoming attractive pressures from quirk and schofield s 1955 data it can be deduced that the ctu occurs at rksat 56 for their specific soil the extent of continued hydraulic reduction past cth approaching ctu undoubtedly has important ramifications for practical management of soil as a resource the cth defined by rksat 10 25 has classically been used to inform irrigation water quality suitability guidelines anzecc 2000 bennett et al 2016b bennett and warren 2015 de menezes et al 2014 dnr 1997 where the 10 25 range demonstrates the arbitrary but measureable departure for the potential minima mcneal and coleman 1966 quirk 2001 quirk and murray 1991 raine et al 2007 in essence use of the cth in this manner provides a practical buffer in terms of managing the likelihood or irreparable soil structural damage due to dispersion occurring a direct assertion of quirk 2001 if the cth were to be defined as the aggregate dispersion boundary ctu there would be no buffer for error in management of the system i e if management resulted in slightly more hydraulic reduction than predicted and dispersion occurred then the irreparable damage is done hence methods that determine the suitability of irrigation solution for application to land based on the aggregate dispersion boundary condition ctu may actually cause considerable damage to the function of the soil resource due to substantial rksat beyond the cth as cth has been demonstrated as soil specific it stands to reason that ctu would similarly be soil specific therefore this work seeks to quantify the rksat associated with ctu and in relation to cth in doing so this work aims to prove the hypothesis that rksat at the ctu rksat at the cth and provide clarity for the basis of setting irrigation water quality guidelines in terms of solute thresholds 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil selection and initial characteristics five vertisol soils iuss working group 2014 were used in this study and collected from cotton farms in southeast queensland soil samples were collected uniformly from a 0 0 2 m depth air dried and gently ground to pass a 2 mm sieve the initial chemical characteristics of the soils were relatively similar table 1 with some variation in the mineralogical suite table 2 soil ph ranged between 7 and 8 6 the soil sar was 1 mmolc l and the soil edp exchangeable dispersive potential bennett et al 2016a was 7 for soils 1 through 4 while soil 5 had edp 12 5 the clay content was generally between 60 and 75 however soil 2 had a lower clay content of 50 which subsequently coincided with a lower cec and substantially lower monmorillonite content each of the soils before treatment with mqss water had zeta potential within the stable aggregate range 0 to 30 mv indicating that these soils were initially non dispersive which was further supported by results for spontaneous dispersion soil ph and electrical conductivity ec were determined in 1 5 soil deionised di water using a radiometer analytical ion 450 meter exchangeable and soluble cations were determined using a perkin elmer nexion icp ms inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer the soluble salts were measured in 1 5 soil deionised di water for exchangeable cations the soluble salts were washed with deionised water and then the samples were extracted with 0 5 m nh4cl ph adjusted to 7 2 or 8 2 to match the ph of the soil analysed marchuk and rengasamy 2012 these were done using a 1 5 nh4cl solution the extracted soluble cations were put through a centrifuge for 30 mins and analysed on the icp ms to calculate sar see rayment and lyons 2011 method 15a2 the tendency of aggregates to disperse was assessed by use of the zeta potential ζ measured using a malvern zetasizer see marchuk and rengasamy 2012 clay content in the dispersion was measured by turbidity ntu using a nach 2100n turbiditimeter and converted to dispersed clay content using the method of zhu et al 2016 to determine the mineralogical composition of the soils xrd analysis was used and clay fractions were separated by sedimentation jackson 2005 no addition of dispersing agents or chemical treatments such as for organic matter or oxide removal were made to the clay samples dry clay samples were finely ground 2 μm fraction prior to analysis the xrd patterns for randomly oriented air dried samples were recorded with a panalytical x pert pro multi purpose diffractometer using fe filtered cokα radiation automatic divergence slit 2 anti scatter slit and fast x celerator si strip detector the diffraction patterns were recorded from 3 to 80 2θ with a 0 5 s counting time per step for an overall counting time of approximately 30 min xrd data were assessed using csiro software xplot for windows raven 1990 mineralogical phase identifications were first made by comparing the xrd patterns with the international centre for diffraction data icdd database of standard diffraction patterns and specific clay mineral identification criteria were based on brown and brindley 1980 and moore and reynolds 1989 only reflections for crystalline minerals were considered in these analyses information about the dioctahedral trioctahedral structure of the clay minerals was obtained by examination of the 060 reflections of randomly oriented samples all 5 soils had a two component clay mineral suite of montmorillonite d 15 8 å and kaolinite d 7 15 å dioctahedral types 060 patterns not shown in addition to accessory minerals anatase d 3 52 å hematite d 2 70 å and the primary mineral quartz d 3 34 å table 2 soil 2 was the only soil dominated by quartz whereby the rest were montmoriilonite dominant 2 2 threshold electrolyte concentration methodology the cth of the soils was determined using a modification of the method presented in ezlit et al 2013 in this work polyvinyl chloride pvc columns of 15 cm height were used to accommodate the propensity for the soils to swell even in a pure ca system the soil core was 5 cm thick and prepared to an average bulk density of 1 4 g cm3 this average density was obtained as described by ezlit et al 2013 and then all cores for that particular soil were prepared to the average density the cores were soaked in a cacl2 sar 0 pre treatment solution at the respective treatment ec 0 5 1 0 2 0 4 0 or 8 0 ds m from the base with an initial hydraulic head of 4 cm increasing the head to 0 cm over an hour and then left to saturate for 12 h the cores were subjected to cacl2 in order to produce a state of potential minima the most stable possible state as described by quirk and schofield 1955 and consistent with the method of ezlit et al 2013 the cores were supported in bucher funnels and allowed to drain for at least 24 h this allowed for slaking and structural rearrangement to occur thereafter remaining saturated at all times cores were re saturated and then the pre treatment solution was applied at a constant head of 2 cm until steady state in hydraulic conductivity was achieved steady state was defined as being reached when less than 3 variation was obtained between 5 consecutive hourly readings once steady state was achieved the saturated hydraulic conductivity was calculated using darcy s law these data were used as the baseline from which rksat was determined for the subsequent equilibration with treatment solutions the solutions used for cth analysis were synthesised to achieve five constant ec values of 0 5 1 2 4 and 8 ds m with nine varying sets of sar concentration table 3 the target sar range at each ec was based on sar range sufficient to cause dispersion at the given ec as defined by australian and new zealand guidelines anzecc 2000 while not definitive this provided a reasonable means to set target sar ranges by ec this gave a total of 45 individual treatment solutions for which rksat was calculated once the cores had been allowed to drain to induce slaking they were kept at saturation for the entirety of the experimental analysis two replicates for each soil were used to determine cth creating a total of 90 cores the rksat data were fitted with the disaggregation model eq 1 in ezlit et al 2013 as a function of ec and sar the disaggregation model relates steady state hydraulic conductivity occurring for a given sar and ec to the most stable condition of a soil to formulate a 3 dimensional hydraulic reduction surface the most stable condition of a soil occurrs within a ca dominant system as a potential minima the model uses observed data from laboratory leaching columns to account for soil specificity the 20 40 60 and 80 rksat contour were extracted and plotted for each soil with the 20 reduction contour used to represent cth table curve 3d version 4 0 systat software inc 2002 was used to fit the equation and matlab r2015a the mathworks inc 2015 was used to extract the cth contour 1 r k s a t 1 g e m e s p 100 x 0 e s p 100 a b

parameters allowed to auto optimize by the model n b e is an exponent 2 3 threshold turbidity concentration according to quirk and schofield 1955 the ctu is where clay particulate is first observed in the leachate but is later defined as equivalent to the aggregate dispersion boundary quirk 2001 as entrainment of dispersed clay may occur towards the surface prior to discharge with leachate we sought a method that directly measured the aggregate dispersion boundary a modified dispersive potential method was used marchuk and rengasamy 2012 a further set of soil cores was prepared for each soil as per those for cth determination the cores were equilibrated with treatment solutions table 3 which was determined as the steady state saturated hydraulic conductivity hydraulic head of 2 cm steady state was defined as being reached when less than 3 variation was obtained between 5 consecutive hourly readings once the cores were equilibrated the top 1 cm of soil core was removed and allowed to air dry prior to being gently ground to pass a 2 mm sieve these equilibrated soil samples formed the basis for ctu determination ten grams of the equilibrated air dried soil sample for each soil was placed into a 150 ml jar and 100 ml of di water was added after upending the jars three times at a rate of one rotation per minute they were allowed to settle for 4 h samples where the clay remained in suspension after 4 h had the suspension carefully subsampled by pipette and transferred into a test tube these suspensions were then titrated with nacl cacl2 solution prepared for the respective treatment sar and ec sufficient to achieve a 0 1 ds m increase within the tube every 12 h until flocculation occurred and the suspension settle completely once this point has been reached the solution ec and sar were directly measured and these data were used to determine the ctu for the five soils the ec and sar measured in the previous step were much lower than the initial treatment solutions that were used to equilibrate the soil samples this was due to the dilution with di water therefore another five sar solutions corresponding to the soil s ctu relationship determined previously were prepared within the measured range of ec further soil cores for each soil were prepared as per the cth determination the same approach to pre treatment and treatment was used but the subsequent treatment solutions were matched to the respective ctu table 4 soil cores were once again allowed to drain as per the cth procedure and then re saturated once saturated they remained saturated for the entirety of the hydraulic conductivity measurement process saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured using a 2 cm hydraulic head and all solutions were run until steady state was reached reduction in saturated hydraulic conductivity was determined as reduction from the pre treatment solutions for each ctu where sar 0 i e prepared as cacl2 for the specified ctu in table 4 3 statistical analyses the ctu points were fitted using linear regression with sar as the regression factor the ctu relationship was linear for all soils within the measured domain n b the measured domain varied for each soil beyond this domain the relationship was extrapolated for the purpose of comparison to the cth measured domain 0 5 8 0 ds m the cth was curve linear for the 0 5 8 0 ds m measured domain but could be explained by a linear relationship over the ctu measured domain thus for the purpose of comparison within the ctu measured domain both the ctu and the cth were fitted by linear regression with sar as the regression factor this allowed the calculation of the safety factor fs that was described by quick as the regression gradient for the cth divided by the regression gradient at the ctu that is 2 f s a 2 a 1 where c t u a 1 s a r b 1 c t h a 2 s a r b 2 where the regression gradient is defined as ai and the y intercept as bj pearson s product moment correlation coefficient was calculated for all linear regression equations direct comparison of these linear regressions were subsequently undertaken 4 results and discussion 4 1 reduction in hydraulic conductivity at the turbidity threshold the observed rksat for the five soils tested confirms the hypothesis that rksat at the ctu rksat at the cth fig 1 table 4 the rksat at the ctu ranged between 43 and 55 42 46 55 78 65 75 and 33 52 for soils 1 through 5 respectively for the measured sar range table 4 in comparison the cth is defined as either a 10 quirk and schofield 1955 or 20 ezlit et al 2013 reduction in hydraulic conductivity this suggests that for the 5 soils the ctu produced a further reduction in saturated hydraulic conductivity of 38 51 or 28 41 on average as compared to cth quirk and cth ezlit respectively notably the rksat associated with the ctu increases with increasing sar and ec suggesting that greater reduction in hydraulic conductivity can be tolerated prior to dispersion as a result of osmotic potential increased ec this equated to 12 4 23 10 and 20 further decrease associated with a 0 40 0 47 0 42 0 66 and 1 18 ds m increase in ec increase in ec from the minimum to the maximum ec directly tested for soils 1 through 5 respectively due to the dilution method used and the initial sar values on the equilibrated soil samples the rksat relationship for ctu existed within the 0 5 1 7 ds m domain within this domain the ctu was represented by a linear relationship with sar yielding r2 0 88 for all soils table 5 if the linear trend is assumed to be correct fig 1 for beyond the measure domain an arbitraryvalue of ec 3 0 bennett et al 2016b qadir oster 2004 the ctu values 95 83 96 81 and 77 for soils 1 through 5 respectively are associated such reduction in hydraulic conductivity prior to dispersion occurring is substantial and it is advised that further testing within this predicted domain would be required interestingly the observed reduction for soil 4 75 was not far removed from the predicted rksat results of 81 suggesting that such reduction while substantial could be possible for the five soils there was no general agreement in terms of the reduction magnitude although it is evident that the observed rksat associated with the ctu is much greater than the 20 or 10 rksat values associated with the cth by ezlit et al 2013 and quirk and schofield 1955 respectively 4 2 relationship between electrolyte and turbidity threshold concentrations quirk 2001 suggests that the ctu is approximately ¼ that of the cth showing that the cth provides a 3 4 fold safety factor eq 2 in terms of inducing dispersion given the extent of hydraulic reduction in this work investigation on how general this safety factor might be given that the cth has clearly been established as soil specific bennett et al submitted bennett and raine 2012 mcneal and coleman 1966 the relationships between ctu and cth quirk rksat 10 as well as cth ezlit rksat 20 are shown in table 5 and are assumed to be linear for the measured domain this assumption was fair for the purpose of comparison r2 0 98 for all five soils in the low ec measured domain but it is acknowledged here that the actual relationship between cth and sar is curve linear for soils 1 through 3 and soil 5 the safety factor between the ctu and cth quirk ranged between 1 9 and 10 1 soil 4 produced a safety factor of 321 5 which was an artefact of very quick initial reduction in hydraulic conductivity associated with increasing sar at a given ec subsequently this reduction rate became more gradual irrespective of such result it is clear that ctu is similarly soil specific in terms of the associated safety factor this is not unexpected and was indeed demonstrated by marchuk and rengasamy 2012 but was reported as a soil specific cth response occurring at the aggregation dispersion boundary however this work confirms quite clearly that the ctu and the cth as defined by the pioneering work of quirk and schofield 1955 are distinctly different thresholds and that ctu is general much less than cth while the ctu represented follows a similar linear relationship within the measured domain there is an extreme departure from cth in the extrapolated domain the rksat curves for 20 through 80 follow a curve linear trend with respect to the ezlit et al 2013 semi empirical model that is they are determined by a direct reduction in saturated hydraulic conductivity rather than a specific physicochemical boundary while the cth concept is related directly to hydraulic reduction the ctu concept is related to a specific boundary where aggregates disperse into soil separates it is possible that the relationship is curve linear for ctu and simply requires measured data within the predicted domain but it also raises interesting discussion about whether we should expect ctu to be represented by a consistent rksat bennett et al submitted observed that the soil specific volume change in the clay domain at the cth was apparently not related to the absence or presence of organic matter in the soil r2 0 03 on the other hand tisdall and oades 1982 suggest that organic matter has inherently important function in binding aggregates even at the sub micron level we believe that it is possible that the ctu occurs at much greater rksat as ctu increases due to interaction between osmotic pressure and the effect of organic matter physically bonding clay domains that is that the organic matter does not become important until the aggregate dispersion boundary is approached in terms of its physical effect on binding clay together this suggests that the disaggregation pressure within the clay domain is greater than the force by which the organic matter binds the particles together this may explain why greater rksat is tolerated prior to dispersion at greater ctu our data cannot confirm this but suggests it is a useful hypothesis to test 4 3 validation of the disaggregation model for turbidity threshold concentration determination the observed rksat in comparison to that directly taken from the 3 dimensional rksat surface as produced by the semi empirical disaggregation model of ezlit et al 2013 is presented in fig 2 in terms of the relationship between observed and predicted the 1 1 line explained greater than 89 of the variation r2 89 7 suggesting that predicting the rksat at the ctu where sar is known is a reasonable approach 4 4 towards meaningful irrigation water quality guidelines use of ctu as the guideline for marginal quality saline sodic water strategic use is not advisable given the magnitude of reduction within the observed domain 0 1 5 ds m furthermore the aggregate dispersion threshold ctu has no safety buffer which cth provides to a reasonable degree the determination of these thresholds is done on the basis of saturated conditions with no direct inclusion of a measure for rapid dilution due to rainfall ali et al 2018 demonstrated that gypsum acting as an electrolyte buffered soil structure from dispersion when the ec was reduced rapidly this same reasoning is the assertion of quirk and schofield 1955 that cth is the practical threshold as the extra electrolyte allows dilution from rainfall to occur with reduced chance of irreversible hydraulic reduction therefore equating the ctu aggregation dispersion boundary with irrigation practical guidelines has a large inherent risk and should not be advised de menezes et al 2014 discuss that for some soils a rksat 20 may indeed be tolerable especially where that soil had extremely high saturated hydraulic conductivity to begin with e g soils within the sand sandy associated texture classes for other soils any rksat may be irrelevant in terms of irrigation suitability based on an initially extremely low saturated hydraulic conductivity the latter situation would suggest irrigation is not feasible irrespective of water quality while the former situation begs the question of what rksat is tolerable we contend that to answer this question the ctu should not be breached as tolerable reduction should be practically defined as minimising environmental harm in this case if the rksat is less than observed at the ctu then the change in saturated hydraulic conductivity is theoretically reversible quirk and aylmore 1971 quirk and murray 1991 quirk and schofield 1955 as clay domain volume expansion due to diffuse double layer development can be compressed provided the domain has not actively dispersed the size of clay domains will affect the point that brownian motion dislocates particles and disperses domains indicating that smaller domains would be expected to disperse prior to larger ones for this reason hydraulic conductivity reduction should be reversible to some extent but not expected to be completely reversible hence the extent of reversibility may also affect the use of irrigation guidelines beyond the cth and prior to the ctu 5 conclusion the ctu was demonstrated as being less than the cth and the associated rksat at the turbidity threshold ranging between 44 and 78 for the five vertisol soils investigated this confirms that rksat is much greater at the ctu than at the cth this result reinforces that management guidelines should not be based on the ctu or at the aggregation dispersion boundary as measured in clay solute suspensions from water dispersible clay this being equivalent to the ctu this work suggests that irrigation water quality application can be optimised on a soil specific basis provided the rksat deemed tolerable lies between that observed at the ctu and cth and careful monitoring ensues acknowledgements the authours wish to acknowledge the cotton research and

classically been used to inform irrigation water quality suitability guidelines anzecc 2000 bennett et al 2016b bennett and warren 2015 de menezes et al 2014 dnr 1997 where the 10 25 range demonstrates the arbitrary but measureable departure for the potential minima mcneal and coleman 1966 quirk 2001 quirk and murray 1991 raine et al 2007 in essence use of the cth in this manner provides a practical buffer in terms of managing the likelihood or irreparable soil structural damage due to dispersion occurring a direct assertion of quirk 2001 if the cth were to be defined as the aggregate dispersion boundary ctu there would be no buffer for error in management of the system i e if management resulted in slightly more hydraulic reduction than predicted and dispersion occurred then the irreparable damage is done hence methods that determine the suitability of irrigation solution for application to land based on the aggregate dispersion boundary condition ctu may actually cause considerable damage to the function of the soil resource due to substantial rksat beyond the cth as cth has been demonstrated as soil specific it stands to reason that ctu would similarly be soil specific therefore this work seeks to quantify the rksat associated with ctu and in relation to cth in doing so this work aims to prove the hypothesis that rksat at the ctu rksat at the cth and provide clarity for the basis of setting irrigation water quality guidelines in terms of solute thresholds 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil selection and initial characteristics five vertisol soils iuss working group 2014 were used in this study and collected from cotton farms in southeast queensland soil samples were collected uniformly from a 0 0 2 m depth air dried and gently ground to pass a 2 mm sieve the initial chemical characteristics of the soils were relatively similar table 1 with some variation in the mineralogical suite table 2 soil ph ranged between 7 and 8 6 the soil sar was 1 mmolc l and the soil edp exchangeable dispersive potential bennett et al 2016a was 7 for soils 1 through 4 while soil 5 had edp 12 5 the clay content was generally between 60 and 75 however soil 2 had a lower clay content of 50 which subsequently coincided with a lower cec and substantially lower monmorillonite content each of the soils before treatment with mqss water had zeta potential within the stable aggregate range 0 to 30 mv indicating that these soils were initially non dispersive which was further supported by results for spontaneous dispersion soil ph and electrical conductivity ec were determined in 1 5 soil deionised di water using a radiometer analytical ion 450 meter exchangeable and soluble cations were determined using a perkin elmer nexion icp ms inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer the soluble salts were measured in 1 5 soil deionised di water for exchangeable cations the soluble salts were washed with deionised water and then the samples were extracted with 0 5 m nh4cl ph adjusted to 7 2 or 8 2 to match the ph of the soil analysed marchuk and rengasamy 2012 these were done using a 1 5 nh4cl solution the extracted soluble cations were put through a centrifuge for 30 mins and analysed on the icp ms to calculate sar see rayment and lyons 2011 method 15a2 the tendency of aggregates to disperse was assessed by use of the zeta potential ζ measured using a malvern zetasizer see marchuk and rengasamy 2012 clay content in the dispersion was measured by turbidity ntu using a nach 2100n turbiditimeter and converted to dispersed clay content using the method of zhu et al 2016 to determine the mineralogical composition of the soils xrd analysis was used and clay fractions were separated by sedimentation jackson 2005 no addition of dispersing agents or chemical treatments such as for organic matter or oxide removal were made to the clay samples dry clay samples were finely ground 2 μm fraction prior to analysis the xrd patterns for randomly oriented air dried samples were recorded with a panalytical x pert pro multi purpose diffractometer using fe filtered cokα radiation automatic divergence slit 2 anti scatter slit and fast x celerator si strip detector the diffraction patterns were recorded from 3 to 80 2θ with a 0 5 s counting time per step for an overall counting time of approximately 30 min xrd data were assessed using csiro software xplot for windows raven 1990 mineralogical phase identifications were first made by comparing the xrd patterns with the international centre for diffraction data icdd database of standard diffraction patterns and specific clay mineral identification criteria were based on brown and brindley 1980 and moore and reynolds 1989 only reflections for crystalline minerals were considered in these analyses information about the dioctahedral trioctahedral structure of the clay minerals was obtained by examination of the 060 reflections of randomly oriented samples all 5 soils had a two component clay mineral suite of montmorillonite d 15 8 å and kaolinite d 7 15 å dioctahedral types 060 patterns not shown in addition to accessory minerals anatase d 3 52 å hematite d 2 70 å and the primary mineral quartz d 3 34 å table 2 soil 2 was the only soil dominated by quartz whereby the rest were montmoriilonite dominant 2 2 threshold electrolyte concentration methodology the cth of the soils was determined using a modification of the method presented in ezlit et al 2013 in this work polyvinyl chloride pvc columns of 15 cm height were used to accommodate the propensity for the soils to swell even in a pure ca system the soil core was 5 cm thick and prepared to an average bulk density of 1 4 g cm3 this average density was obtained as described by ezlit et al 2013 and then all cores for that particular soil were prepared to the average density the cores were soaked in a cacl2 sar 0 pre treatment solution at the respective treatment ec 0 5 1 0 2 0 4 0 or 8 0 ds m from the base with an initial hydraulic head of 4 cm increasing the head to 0 cm over an hour and then left to saturate for 12 h the cores were subjected to cacl2 in order to produce a state of potential minima the most stable possible state as described by quirk and schofield 1955 and consistent with the method of ezlit et al 2013 the cores were supported in bucher funnels and allowed to drain for at least 24 h this allowed for slaking and structural rearrangement to occur thereafter remaining saturated at all times cores were re saturated and then the pre treatment solution was applied at a constant head of 2 cm until steady state in hydraulic conductivity was achieved steady state was defined as being reached when less than 3 variation was obtained between 5 consecutive hourly readings once steady state was achieved the saturated hydraulic conductivity was calculated using darcy s law these data were used as the baseline from which rksat was determined for the subsequent equilibration with treatment solutions the solutions used for cth analysis were synthesised to achieve five constant ec values of 0 5 1 2 4 and 8 ds m with nine varying sets of sar concentration table 3 the target sar range at each ec was based on sar range sufficient to cause dispersion at the given ec as defined by australian and new zealand guidelines anzecc 2000 while not definitive this provided a reasonable means to set target sar ranges by ec this gave a total of 45 individual treatment solutions for which rksat was calculated once the cores had been allowed to drain to induce slaking they were kept at saturation for the entirety of the experimental analysis two replicates for each soil were used to determine cth creating a total of 90 cores the rksat data were fitted with the disaggregation model eq 1 in ezlit et al 2013 as a function of ec and sar the disaggregation model relates steady state hydraulic conductivity occurring for a given sar and ec to the most stable condition of a soil to formulate a 3 dimensional hydraulic reduction surface the most stable condition of a soil occurrs within a ca dominant system as a potential minima the model uses observed data from laboratory leaching columns to account for soil specificity the 20 40 60 and 80 rksat contour were extracted and plotted for each soil with the 20 reduction contour used to represent cth table curve 3d version 4 0 systat software inc 2002 was used to fit the equation and matlab r2015a the mathworks inc 2015 was used to extract the cth contour 1 r k s a t 1 g e m e s p 100 x 0 e s p 100 a b

parameters allowed to auto optimize by the model n b e is an exponent 2 3 threshold turbidity concentration according to quirk and schofield 1955 the ctu is where clay particulate is first observed in the leachate but is later defined as equivalent to the aggregate dispersion boundary quirk 2001 as entrainment of dispersed clay may occur towards the surface prior to discharge with leachate we sought a method that directly measured the aggregate dispersion boundary a modified dispersive potential method was used marchuk and rengasamy 2012 a further set of soil cores was prepared for each soil as per those for cth determination the cores were equilibrated with treatment solutions table 3 which was determined as the steady state saturated hydraulic conductivity hydraulic head of 2 cm steady state was defined as being reached when less than 3 variation was obtained between 5 consecutive hourly readings once the cores were equilibrated the top 1 cm of soil core was removed and allowed to air dry prior to being gently ground to pass a 2 mm sieve these equilibrated soil samples formed the basis for ctu determination ten grams of the equilibrated air dried soil sample for each soil was placed into a 150 ml jar and 100 ml of di water was added after upending the jars three times at a rate of one rotation per minute they were allowed to settle for 4 h samples where the clay remained in suspension after 4 h had the suspension carefully subsampled by pipette and transferred into a test tube these suspensions were then titrated with nacl cacl2 solution prepared for the respective treatment sar and ec sufficient to achieve a 0 1 ds m increase within the tube every 12 h until flocculation occurred and the suspension settle completely once this point has been reached the solution ec and sar were directly measured and these data were used to determine the ctu for the five soils the ec and sar measured in the previous step were much lower than the initial treatment solutions that were used to equilibrate the soil samples this was due to the dilution with di water therefore another five sar solutions corresponding to the soil s ctu relationship determined previously were prepared within the measured range of ec further soil cores for each soil were prepared as per the cth determination the same approach to pre treatment and treatment was used but the subsequent treatment solutions were matched to the respective ctu table 4 soil cores were once again allowed to drain as per the cth procedure and then re saturated once saturated they remained saturated for the entirety of the hydraulic conductivity measurement process saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured using a 2 cm hydraulic head and all solutions were run until steady state was reached reduction in saturated hydraulic conductivity was determined as reduction from the pre treatment solutions for each ctu where sar 0 i e prepared as cacl2 for the specified ctu in table 4 3 statistical analyses the ctu points were fitted using linear regression with sar as the regression factor the ctu relationship was linear for all soils within the measured domain n b the measured domain varied for each soil beyond this domain the relationship was extrapolated for the purpose of comparison to the cth measured domain 0 5 8 0 ds m the cth was curve linear for the 0 5 8 0 ds m measured domain but could be explained by a linear relationship over the ctu measured domain thus for the purpose of comparison within the ctu measured domain both the ctu and the cth were fitted by linear regression with sar as the regression factor this allowed the calculation of the safety factor fs that was described by quick as the regression gradient for the cth divided by the regression gradient at the ctu that is 2 f s a 2 a 1 where c t u a 1 s a r b 1 c t h a 2 s a r b 2 where the regression gradient is defined as ai and the y intercept as bj pearson s product moment correlation coefficient was calculated for all linear regression equations direct comparison of these linear regressions were subsequently undertaken 4 results and discussion 4 1 reduction in hydraulic conductivity at the turbidity threshold the observed rksat for the five soils tested confirms the hypothesis that rksat at the ctu rksat at the cth fig 1 table 4 the rksat at the ctu ranged between 43 and 55 42 46 55 78 65 75 and 33 52 for soils 1 through 5 respectively for the measured sar range table 4 in comparison the cth is defined as either a 10 quirk and schofield 1955 or 20 ezlit et al 2013 reduction in hydraulic conductivity this suggests that for the 5 soils the ctu produced a further reduction in saturated hydraulic conductivity of 38 51 or 28 41 on average as compared to cth quirk and cth ezlit respectively notably the rksat associated with the ctu increases with increasing sar and ec suggesting that greater reduction in hydraulic conductivity can be tolerated prior to dispersion as a result of osmotic potential increased ec this equated to 12 4 23 10 and 20 further decrease associated with a 0 40 0 47 0 42 0 66 and 1 18 ds m increase in ec increase in ec from the minimum to the maximum ec directly tested for soils 1 through 5 respectively due to the dilution method used and the initial sar values on the equilibrated soil samples the rksat relationship for ctu existed within the 0 5 1 7 ds m domain within this domain the ctu was represented by a linear relationship with sar yielding r2 0 88 for all soils table 5 if the linear trend is assumed to be correct fig 1 for beyond the measure domain an arbitraryvalue of ec 3 0 bennett et al 2016b qadir oster 2004 the ctu values 95 83 96 81 and 77 for soils 1 through 5 respectively are associated such reduction in hydraulic conductivity prior to dispersion occurring is substantial and it is advised that further testing within this predicted domain would be required interestingly the observed reduction for soil 4 75 was not far removed from the predicted rksat results of 81 suggesting that such reduction while substantial could be possible for the five soils there was no general agreement in terms of the reduction magnitude although it is evident that the observed rksat associated with the ctu is much greater than the 20 or 10 rksat values associated with the cth by ezlit et al 2013 and quirk and schofield 1955 respectively 4 2 relationship between electrolyte and turbidity threshold concentrations quirk 2001 suggests that the ctu is approximately ¼ that of the cth showing that the cth provides a 3 4 fold safety factor eq 2 in terms of inducing dispersion given the extent of hydraulic reduction in this work investigation on how general this safety factor might be given that the cth has clearly been established as soil specific bennett et al submitted bennett and raine 2012 mcneal and coleman 1966 the relationships between ctu and cth quirk rksat 10 as well as cth ezlit rksat 20 are shown in table 5 and are assumed to be linear for the measured domain this assumption was fair for the purpose of comparison r2 0 98 for all five soils in the low ec measured domain but it is acknowledged here that the actual relationship between cth and sar is curve linear for soils 1 through 3 and soil 5 the safety factor between the ctu and cth quirk ranged between 1 9 and 10 1 soil 4 produced a safety factor of 321 5 which was an artefact of very quick initial reduction in hydraulic conductivity associated with increasing sar at a given ec subsequently this reduction rate became more gradual irrespective of such result it is clear that ctu is similarly soil specific in terms of the associated safety factor this is not unexpected and was indeed demonstrated by marchuk and rengasamy 2012 but was reported as a soil specific cth response occurring at the aggregation dispersion boundary however this work confirms quite clearly that the ctu and the cth as defined by the pioneering work of quirk and schofield 1955 are distinctly different thresholds and that ctu is general much less than cth while the ctu represented follows a similar linear relationship within the measured domain there is an extreme departure from cth in the extrapolated domain the rksat curves for 20 through 80 follow a curve linear trend with respect to the ezlit et al 2013 semi empirical model that is they are determined by a direct reduction in saturated hydraulic conductivity rather than a specific physicochemical boundary while the cth concept is related directly to hydraulic reduction the ctu concept is related to a specific boundary where aggregates disperse into soil separates it is possible that the relationship is curve linear for ctu and simply requires measured data within the predicted domain but it also raises interesting discussion about whether we should expect ctu to be represented by a consistent rksat bennett et al submitted observed that the soil specific volume change in the clay domain at the cth was apparently not related to the absence or presence of organic matter in the soil r2 0 03 on the other hand tisdall and oades 1982 suggest that organic matter has inherently important function in binding aggregates even at the sub micron level we believe that it is possible that the ctu occurs at much greater rksat as ctu increases due to interaction between osmotic pressure and the effect of organic matter physically bonding clay domains that is that the organic matter does not become important until the aggregate dispersion boundary is approached in terms of its physical effect on binding clay together this suggests that the disaggregation pressure within the clay domain is greater than the force by which the organic matter binds the particles together this may explain why greater rksat is tolerated prior to dispersion at greater ctu our data cannot confirm this but suggests it is a useful hypothesis to test 4 3 validation of the disaggregation model for turbidity threshold concentration determination the observed rksat in comparison to that directly taken from the 3 dimensional rksat surface as produced by the semi empirical disaggregation model of ezlit et al 2013 is presented in fig 2 in terms of the relationship between observed and predicted the 1 1 line explained greater than 89 of the variation r2 89 7 suggesting that predicting the rksat at the ctu where sar is known is a reasonable approach 4 4 towards meaningful irrigation water quality guidelines use of ctu as the guideline for marginal quality saline sodic water strategic use is not advisable given the magnitude of reduction within the observed domain 0 1 5 ds m furthermore the aggregate dispersion threshold ctu has no safety buffer which cth provides to a reasonable degree the determination of these thresholds is done on the basis of saturated conditions with no direct inclusion of a measure for rapid dilution due to rainfall ali et al 2018 demonstrated that gypsum acting as an electrolyte buffered soil structure from dispersion when the ec was reduced rapidly this same reasoning is the assertion of quirk and schofield 1955 that cth is the practical threshold as the extra electrolyte allows dilution from rainfall to occur with reduced chance of irreversible hydraulic reduction therefore equating the ctu aggregation dispersion boundary with irrigation practical guidelines has a large inherent risk and should not be advised de menezes et al 2014 discuss that for some soils a rksat 20 may indeed be tolerable especially where that soil had extremely high saturated hydraulic conductivity to begin with e g soils within the sand sandy associated texture classes for other soils any rksat may be irrelevant in terms of irrigation suitability based on an initially extremely low saturated hydraulic conductivity the latter situation would suggest irrigation is not feasible irrespective of water quality while the former situation begs the question of what rksat is tolerable we contend that to answer this question the ctu should not be breached as tolerable reduction should be practically defined as minimising environmental harm in this case if the rksat is less than observed at the ctu then the change in saturated hydraulic conductivity is theoretically reversible quirk and aylmore 1971 quirk and murray 1991 quirk and schofield 1955 as clay domain volume expansion due to diffuse double layer development can be compressed provided the domain has not actively dispersed the size of clay domains will affect the point that brownian motion dislocates particles and disperses domains indicating that smaller domains would be expected to disperse prior to larger ones for this reason hydraulic conductivity reduction should be reversible to some extent but not expected to be completely reversible hence the extent of reversibility may also affect the use of irrigation guidelines beyond the cth and prior to the ctu 5 conclusion the ctu was demonstrated as being less than the cth and the associated rksat at the turbidity threshold ranging between 44 and 78 for the five vertisol soils investigated this confirms that rksat is much greater at the ctu than at the cth this result reinforces that management guidelines should not be based on the ctu or at the aggregation dispersion boundary as measured in clay solute suspensions from water dispersible clay this being equivalent to the ctu this work suggests that irrigation water quality application can be optimised on a soil specific basis provided the rksat deemed tolerable lies between that observed at the ctu and cth and careful monitoring ensues acknowledgements the authours wish to acknowledge the cotton research and

11478,the feasability of using reclaimed water rw to irrigate nectarines in apulia to reduce sea water intrusion has been studied in an orchard for 3 years while the primary water quality parameters were significantly higher in rw than in fresh water fw concentrations were below the phytotoxic threshold that would cause significant yield losses under good management practices in general fruit quality parameters of nectarines total phenolics and antioxidant compounds were higher in fruits irrigated with rw than fw because of higher nutrients and salinity in the rw treatment lower firmness values were observed in rw treated fruits implying early ripening overall no yield differences were found between fw and rw treated trees during the three year study however the rw treatment significanly reduced the number of fruits but this reduction was compensated by a larger individual fruit weight while this 3yr study has demonstrated that reclaimed water is a feasable alternative to freshwater in areas in southern italy further long term studies are still needed to show the beneficial effects of rw on nectarine fruit yield and quality abbreviations rw reclaimed water fw fresh

irrigation reclaimed wastewater salinity antioxidant activity phenols leaf analysis 1 introduction apulia is a region in south eastern italy that extends over 19 thousand km2 including about 800 km of coastlines and 4 500 000 inhabitants among all italian regions apulia has the smallest amount of available water 136 m3 capita per year 1 and the lowest average annual rainfall i e about 660 mm 1 lopez et al 2010 nevertheless its economy is ranked as one of the best in southern italy supported largely by two water demanding activities tourism and agriculture most of the apulian land is used for agricultural purposes but only about a quarter of the cultivated area is irrigated i e 3653 km2 disciglio et al 2014 the annual apulian water consumption is estimated to be around 1500 hm3 of which 55 comes from regional resources and 45 is imported from bordering regions campania molise basilicata by the apulian aqueduct i e the largest in europe with its 19 635 km of pipe distribution network some studies alcalde and gawlik 2014 regione 2012 raso 2013 levine and asano 2004 show that the improvement of urban wastewater treatment as consequence of population growth and tourism would increase the regional annual wáter availability for irrigation by 60 million m3 about 10 of the overall irrigation water demand arborea et al 2017 such a supplemental source of wáter would help satisfy agriculture needs which is a high demand in this semi arid region while an attractive option use of reclaimed water for irrigation has important issues that must be addressed for example salinity and over application of nutrients are problems associated with reclaimed water irrigation in arid and semi arid environments soil salinization is a major threat in fruit trees since they are among the most salt sensitive horticultural crops fao 1985 approximately 6 of world cultivated land has salinity problems where nacl is usually the most abundant and soluble salt hasegawa et al 2000 munns and tester 2008 in apulia region it has been estimated that regional farmers have drilled more than 200 000 wells whose extensive exploitation of groundwater resources is causing the progressive salinization and depletion of relevant portions of the regional aquifers reducing the quality and availability of water for agriculture this phenomenon is particularly relevant along the coastline where a sharp increase in salinity of the groundwater has been recorded with peaks as high as 2 ds m 1 maggiore et al 2001 nectarine production has a growing economic importance worldwide and in southern italy the apulia region is the leading producer for nectarine both fruit quantity and quality are important as other factors like early ripening deficit irrigation and yield variability zarini 2014 in regards to variability several studies focusing on precision irrigation on peach fruit quality and quantity have been done for example deficit irrigation strategies elnesr et al 2016 have shown that fruit quality particulary the soluble solid content has been improved pliakoni and nanos 2010 but such a quality improvement can lead to a yield reduction at least to some extent abrisqueta et al 2010 rufat et al 2010 deficit irrigation strategies can also cause fruit peel stress reduction on vitamin c and carotenoids and an increase in the phenolic content mainly anthocyanins and procyanidins buendía et al 2008 in general stone fruit crops tend to manifest a moderate to high sensitivity to salinity several interesting studies have been conducted in prunus but with artificial salty irrigation water gainza et al 2015 massai et al 2004 which simulates increased salt content in reclaimed water on irrigation water quality effects on peach fruit quality especially reclaimed water experiments are limited or too old basiouny 1984 lurie et al 1996 or focus on fruit safety vivaldi et al 2013 or short term effects on fruit quality vivaldi et al 2017 for that reason the aim of this work was to study the effects of reclaimed water on the fruit quality and yield in drip irrigated nectarine trees over a three year duration 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a three year study 2012 2014 was carried out in a comercial nectarine grove prunus persica l batsch cv big top grafted on gf 677 the grove was planted in 2008 and is located in trinitapoli apulia region southern italy 41 22 92 n 16 03 16 27 e altitude 1m the climate of the experimental area is classified as semiarid like the 75 3 of the region kapur et al 2010 the planting density was 400 trees ha 1 with 5 m spacing between rows and 5 m between trees the trees were vase shaped trained the soil was sandy loam and was classified as vertisol gleysols fao the main physical and chemical characteristics of the soil are reported in vivaldi et al 2013 a total of 80 trees were used in this study the experimental design was a randomized complete design with 4 blocks and four experimental plots per block one per each irrigation water source the standard plot was made up of 5 trees located in 4 adjacent rows the three central trees of the middle row were used for measurements and the other 2 trees were guard trees fertilizers were applied taking into account nectarine nutrient requirements 102 27 0 kg ha 1 of n2 p2o5 k2o respectively all other agricultural practices pruning weed and pest control were performed following the regional production best good practices the climatic conditions were almost similar during the experimental period 2012 2014 with an average temperature of 17 c 67 relative humidity and rainfall around 500 mm rainfall was more variable during the irrigation period may september from 90 4 mm during 2012 to nearly double the amount i e 176 2 mm in 2014 for that reason the amount of irrigation water applied in 2013 and 2014 were higher respect to 2012 3100 4024 and 3715 m3 ha 1 respectively 2 2 irrigation water sources management and quality two water sources were used in the experiment the first water source was a reclaimed water from a tertiary treated wastewater rw produced by membrane filtration from a wastewater treatment plant located near the experimental site more technical details are described in vivaldi et al 2013 this treatment was compared with fresh water source fw from the marana capacciotti dam which served as the control trees were irrigated by drip irrigation with drip lines suspended along rows on the trees 1 70 m above the soil surface two self compensating drippers delivered water at 12 l h 1 to each tree the distance of the drippers from the trunk was 1 m the irrigation volume has been calculated by the water balance method with restitution of 100 crop evapotranspiration etc lost in each irrigation interval etc was calculated using eq 1 recommended by fao 1 etc kr kc et0 were kr is reduction coefficient kr 0 75 kc 0 50 kcini 1 15 kcmid 0 85 kcend is crop coefficient et0 is reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated by penman monteith equation and directly provided by assocodipuglia www agrometeopuglia it nine water samples from each irrigation water source were collected yearly during the irrigation period may september between 2012 and 2014 in order to characterize irrigation water quality throughout the irrigation season the water analysis were done as reported in vivaldi et al 2017 rw had almost triple the salinity with electrical conductivity ec values close to 1 5 ds m 1 vs 0 5 ds m 1 for that of fw the sar of the rw 3 0 was double that of the fw table 1 the higher salinity level observed in rw was mainly due to the high concentration of cl 161 4 mg l 1 and na 4 8 meq l 1 table 1 although ca mg and so4 were also more concentrated in rw rw also had higher concentrations of nutrients than fw specially macronutrients no3 po4 and k that were 2 28 and 5 times higher in rw respectively 2 3 fruit measurements 2 3 1 fruits yield and quality fruit yield and number of fruits per tree were measured from 12 trees in each treatment from 2012 to 2014 as peaches do not mature all at once were established three commercial harvests periods during the julian days 190 195 and 200 in 2012 183 191 and 199 in 2013 and 182 190 and 198 in 2014 based on firmness and the marketing of the grower samples 180 fruits for each treatment were randomly collected by hand in the middle part of the tree fresh weight g equatorial diameters mm flesh firmness f kg cm 2 soluble solids content ssc brix titratable acidity ta mg l 1 ph and maturity index mi were determined in the

calculating the result as malic acid mg l 1 the ph values were measured using a ph meter crison 507 crison instruments s a barcelona spain mi calculated as the ssc ta ratio was used as an indication of fruit maturity at field harvest 2 4 specific fruit quality measurements specific fruit quality parameters have been measured only during the last experimental year antioxidant activity total phenols respiration rate o quinones and total sugar were analyzed during the three harvest times 2 4 1 respiration rate the respiration rate was measured using a closed system as reported by kader 2002 in detail 3 4 fruits around 400 500 g for each replicate were placed into 6 l sealed plastic jars one jar replicate which were closed and co2 was allowed to accumulate up to 0 1 the time taken to reach this threshold was measured by monitoring the co2 concentration at regular time intervals for co2 analysis 1 ml of gas sample was taken from the head space of the plastic jars through a rubber septum and injected into a gas chromatograph p200 micro gc agilent santa clara ca usa equipped with a thermal conductivity detector carbon dioxide was analyzed using a retention time of 16 s and a total run time of 120 s on a 10 m porous polymer ppu column agilent santa clara ca usa at a constant temperature of 70 c the respiration rate of the nectarines was measured on detached fruits at room temperature about 20 22 c theresults were expressed as ml co2 kg 1 h 1 2 4 2 extraction and analysis of antioxidant activity and total phenols the following extraction procedure was used for antioxidant activity and total phenols pace et al 2011 specifically 5 g of chopped sample for each replicate was homogenized in a methanol water solution 80 20 v v for 1 min and then centrifuged at 5 c at 6440 g for 5 min for dpph assay the extract diluted in water 50 μl was pipetted into 0 95 ml of dpph solution to initiate the reaction the absorbance at 515 nm was measured after about 15 min

homogenate was filtered through four layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged at 6440 g for 5 min the supernatant was used directly to measure the soluble o q at a wavelength of 437 nm 2 4 4 total sugars

centrifuged for 5 min at 6440 g the extract was diluted and was used for the measurement color development was determined at 490 nm and glucose was used as the standard 2 5 leaf measurements to perform the analyses spring flush leaves from non fruiting twigs located in the central part of the tree were sampled each season every three months twenty leaves per tree were sampled in the twelve

tukey s hsd test p 0 05 was used for mean separation 4 results and discussion 4 1 irrigation water quality the water quality was different between the irrigation water sources the values of these parameters were significantly higher in rw than in fw table 1 most woody fruit and nut crops are salt sensitive even in the absence of specific ion effects in particular nectarine trees are considered salt sensitive crops but in both treatments the values did not exceeded the threshold for significant yield losses 1 5 2 ds m 1 ayers and westcot 1985 maas and grattan 1999 a significant portion of nutrients applied in the field is not taken up by plants and is lost through leaching volatilisation nitrification or other means timilsena et al 2015 macro and meso nutrients in rw could allow for a significant reduction in fertilizer application while still meeting tree nutrient requirements as has been seen on fruit trees studies vivaldi et al 2017 pedrero et al 2014 bearing in mind the higher concentration of nutrients in rw and whether or not the fertigation program had been adjusted to account for these increases rw could have provided 4 kg no3 ha 1 44 kg po4 ha 1 84 kg k ha 1 300 kg ca ha 1 60 kg mg ha 1 and 360 kg so4 ha 1 this quantities must be taken into account on the fertirrigation plan to avoid plant injuries detrimental effects caused by specific ion toxicities interactions and soil and groundwater pollution grattan and grieve 1998 4 2 fruit quality in general fruit quality parameters of nectarines such as ssc ta ph f and mi were affected by the type of water used in this experiment table 2 fruits from trees treated with rw water showed higher values on most of the fruit quality parameters during the entire experiment 2012 2014 especially ph and mi these elevated levels were due primarily due to the higher nutrient concentration and salinity of the rw water table 2 in fact many plants adapt to salt stress by enhanced biosynthesis of secondary metabolites such as soluble solids sugars organic acids proteins and amino acids which act as osmolytes to maintain plant turgor under salt stress the presence of these metabolites often increase the nutritive quality and marketability of fruits and vegetables ahlem et al 2011 ahmed et al 2009 it has been demonstrated on different crops tomatoes muskmelon and cucumber that fruit quality parameters such as ssc improved in fruits irrigated with rw biernbaum and argo 1995 pedrero et al 2012 lurie et al 1996 basiouny 1984 under different irrigation regimes lower firmness values in rw treated fruits were observed during the three years as compared to fw treated fruits particularly the last year 5 36 and 5 06 kg cm 2 respectively table 2 this finding was not corroborated on similar fruit trees species on a study conducted by lurie et al 1996 the lower firmness values on rw treated fruits compared to fw can suggest early ripening on fruit trees as was seen the first year vivaldi et al 2017 on peach trees basiouny 1984 showed earlier flowering maturity and ripening on rw treated fruits this study indicates that even being not a high saline reclaimed irrigation water fruit quality parameters can be directly affect because other factors but further long term studies are still needed to demonstrate the effects of rw on such fruit quality parameters and their affect on marketability scandella et al 1997 4 3 specific fruit quality parameters the european union registered a consumption of about 10 7 billion litres of juices in 2011 and a great part of this amount is imported from other countries which makes the monitoring of their quality essential especially total phenolics that have been demostrated to be the main contributors to the antioxidant activity granato et al 2015 the effect of irrigation treatment fw or rw on respiration rate o quinones total sugar antioxidant capacity total phenols of nectarine fruits collected at the three commercial harvest period 182 190 and 198 julian days are reported in table 3 no significant difference in respiration rates were observed at the first and second harvest whereas a slight significant increase was found at final harvest time in rw treated plants regarding the o quinones and total sugar content a significat increase was observed in rw treated fruit but only at the first harvest the value of total phenols was significantly higher in rw treated fruit at the first and second harvest whereas only at first and at the final harvest time was the antioxidant capacity significantly higher in rw treated fruit because the rw treatment had a higher salinity content mild saline stress probably activated secondary metabolic processes resulting in the biosynthesis of phenolic substances that also resulted in an increase in antioxidant activity ramakrishna and aswathanarayana 2011 gil et al 2002 lee and kader 2000 4 4 leaves nutritional status although the soil salinity increased as a result of both treatments the leaf na concentration remained below the toxiciy threshold 0 10 g kg 1 for the entire study table 4 the most popular rootstocks used in peach orchards are gn15 and gf 677 and these are less sensitive to na toxicity than is bitter almond najafian et al 2008 the low na concentration in the leaves under mild salt stress conditions can be explained by rootstock gf 677 ability to restrict na accumulation in the leaves najafian et al 2008 leaf cl concentration was up to the máximum tolerable concentration in both treatments walsh and steinhilber 2005 especially those treated with rw where leaf cl concentration was triple table 4 our results confirm previous reports that for prunus most of leaf toxicity is due to cl rather than na and leaf cl concentration increased linearly as external nacl concentration increased najafian et al 2008 this toxic anion cl appears to have a determinant role in the sensitivity of fruit trees to soil salinity and although no toxicity symptoms were observed the increased uptake of cl can lead to its build up to toxic levels najafian et al 2008 besides the osmotic potential effect fruit trees are also very sensitive to leaf cl and na toxic concentrations depending on rootstocks and cultivars aragüés et al 2014 there has been little documentation on the effect of soil salinity on leaf na and cl concentration in nectarine trees although cl concentrations of above 0 005 g kg 1 leaf dry weight and na concentrations above 0 002 0 003 g kg 1 typically cause toxicity problems in most deciduous fruit trees bernstein 1980 boland et al 1993 saline conditions can rapidly reduce the capacity of roots to absorb essential nutrients from the soil türkana and demiral 2009 sodium ions have been shown to cause disturbances in calcium and potassium nutrition läuchli and grattan 2014 in this experiment potassium concentration on rw irrigation water was almost five times higher than fw and calcium concentrations were double table 1 but excess sodium in the soil solution did not affect leaf ca or k concentrations as has been observed in other experiments grattan and grieve 1998 leaf ca concentration was at the recomended limits under both treatments 0 35 g kg 1 walsh and steinhilber 2005 table 4 as other salinity studies with prunus najafian et al 2008 it seems that the rate of decrease in k na ratio had inverse relationship with the rate of rootstocks resistance so the k na ratio under saline conditions could be considered a selection criteria in prunus rootstock najafian et al 2008 chloride concentration on rw treatment leaves was higher than fw treatment the nitrogen content in leaves in our study was no significant difference between treatments this result is not in accordance with other studies that found to reduce nitrate uptake by crops with high leaf chloride concentration grattan and grieve 1998 no difference in carbon content was seen maybe because of the rootstock it was studied that gf 677 rootstock has a photochemical limitation to photosynthesis najafian et al 2008 boron concentration was under the toxicity levels in both treatments 0 05 g kg 1 walsh and steinhilber 2005 but this is not surprising as nectarine is classified as a b mobile tree brown and shelp 1997 and boron tends to remobilize from leaves to young developing tissues boron toxicity in fruit trees is more common on arid and semi arid environments pedrero et al 2014 but symptoms manifest themselves as twig dieback and gum exudation rather than foliar necrosis brown and shelp 1997 the leaf concentrations for the rest of the micronutrients analyzed zn fe cr cu al and mn were all within the recommended range for both treatments data not shown 4 5 soil salinization and sodicity risks the initial soil salinity ece on the studied soil sandy loam on 2012 at 0 20 cms was high 2 8 ds m 1 due to its close proximity to the saline lagoons only 1 km and the level of the sea groundwater table pta 2002 the two sources of saline pollution seawater intrusión or lagoon intrusion and underground feeds affect the entire perimeter of the hydrogeological unit cotecchia et al 2005 although the irrigation water used previously to the study in the agronomic area during a long term was not salty groundwater table has a high sea salts concentration it has been demostrated that soil water and salt migrations are closely associated with groundwater table groundwater reaches soil layers by capillary upward flow and then may enter the soil water cycle wang et al 2015 in the top 20 cm there is a clear salt accumulation increase on rw treatment from 2 51 to 3 64 ds m 1 72 whereas in fw treatment the ece is keep into the initial soil values 2 5 3 ds m 1 fig 1 on the next layer 20 40 cm salts were acumulated in both treatments at the same level at the end of the experiment around 5 ds m 1 fig 1 on the last depth 40 60 cm salts continued increasing being more pronounced in this case on fw than in rw treatment reaching values as 7 5 and 6 ds m 1 respectively fig 1 overall both irrigation with rw and tw significantly increased ece 120 and 135 respectively but such increases were spacially variable within the soil profile while salts were acumulated at lowest depths in plots irrigated with fw salts where acumulated in the upper portion of the profile in rw treated plots elevated salt concentration within the root zone when trees are irrigated with reclaimed water with similar quality characteristics has been demostrated in different experiments pedrero et al 2014 nicolás et al 2016 the sodicity risk was assesed according to the level of sodium adsorption rate sare calculated after the sodium calcium and magnesium concentration measured in the saturated paste extract on the first layer the sare followed the same distribution than ece the sare of rw treated plots increased seasonally reaching values of 16 while those treated with fw were significantly less 9 fig 2 at the deepest layers a clear leaching phenomenon was observed in plots irrigated with both treatments because as with the ece the sare of rw treated plots decreases by 62 while the fw treatment increased by 130 fig 2 although the sare is not the best indicator for leaching phenomenon rengasamy 2010 in this case it s correlation with ece showed to be a good leaching indicator with these results the experimental soil can be classified as saline sodic because of the dominance of sodium salts sare 6 in saline and sodic soils the solubility of micronutrients e g cu fe mn and zn is particularly low and plants grown in these soils often experience deficiencies in these elements page et al 1990 transient salinity in soils characterised by a high concentration of salts in the subsoil change with depth and throughout the season in response to rainfall surface evaporation and water used by vegetation resulting in different leaching fraction at different layers rengasamy 2016 long term studies are necessary to get better knowledge of the leaching requirements for nectarine to avoid salinity problems and sodicity hazards that could lead to soil degradation ayers and westcot 1985 4 6 yield response bernstein 1980 specified that the yield of peach trees decreases by 10 at an ece of 2 5 ds m 1 in the absence of specific ion effects this osmotic effect is based on the vegetative response of young shoots from young trees maas and hoffman 1977 on the other hand reported that peach fruit weight and the number of peach fruits per tree were reduced by about 50 at an average rootzone ece of about 3 ds m 1 when the soil solution was dominated by cl salts in our case although the high soil salinity levels found on both treatments but specially on first layer in rw only yield differences were found during the first year table 5 the yield difference during 2012 comparing with 2013 and 2014 was because of the third comercial harvest period was lost due to the comercial prunning applied by the grower as a cultural practice the rw treatment reduced the number of fruits significantly as compared to those treated with fw table 5 the individual fruit weight was higher on rw treatment table 5 alsothe percentage of fruits within the desirable comercial caliber 60 64 were also higher than those treated with fw 7 5 to 5 respectively fig 3 this larger fruit size related to a reduction in the number of fruits in trees irrigated with reclaimed water was refered on other similar studies on fruit trees under mediterranean conditions nicolás et al 2016 pedrero et al 2014 pedrero et al 2012 in this sense the smaller crop load can result in an improved marketable yield under severe water stress marsal et al 2010 5 conclusions soil salinity increase can be the main barrier from the sustainability point of view but the interaction between rw nutrients and salinity can be the responsable on fruit quality improvement the other important point is that a tendency toward greater fruit weight and size was observed in rw treatments so the use of reclaimed water can improve the marketable yield with early ripening nevertheless further studies are needed to demonstrate the beneficial effects of rw on necarine fruit quality parameters and the marketable increase in fruit quality however caution must be exercised when changing from surface to reclaimed water the age of the trees and the soil conditions can greatly affect the response of an orchard acknowledgments the authors wish to thank the italian ministry of education university and research miur for its financial support

11478,the feasability of using reclaimed water rw to irrigate nectarines in apulia to reduce sea water intrusion has been studied in an orchard for 3 years while the primary water quality parameters were significantly higher in rw than in fresh water fw concentrations were below the phytotoxic threshold that would cause significant yield losses under good management practices in general fruit quality parameters of nectarines total phenolics and antioxidant compounds were higher in fruits irrigated with rw than fw because of higher nutrients and salinity in the rw treatment lower firmness values were observed in rw treated fruits implying early ripening overall no yield differences were found between fw and rw treated trees during the three year study however the rw treatment significanly reduced the number of fruits but this reduction was compensated by a larger individual fruit weight while this 3yr study has demonstrated that reclaimed water is a feasable alternative to freshwater in areas in southern italy further long term studies are still needed to show the beneficial effects of rw on nectarine fruit yield and quality abbreviations rw reclaimed water fw fresh

irrigation reclaimed wastewater salinity antioxidant activity phenols leaf analysis 1 introduction apulia is a region in south eastern italy that extends over 19 thousand km2 including about 800 km of coastlines and 4 500 000 inhabitants among all italian regions apulia has the smallest amount of available water 136 m3 capita per year 1 and the lowest average annual rainfall i e about 660 mm 1 lopez et al 2010 nevertheless its economy is ranked as one of the best in southern italy supported largely by two water demanding activities tourism and agriculture most of the apulian land is used for agricultural purposes but only about a quarter of the cultivated area is irrigated i e 3653 km2 disciglio et al 2014 the annual apulian water consumption is estimated to be around 1500 hm3 of which 55 comes from regional resources and 45 is imported from bordering regions campania molise basilicata by the apulian aqueduct i e the largest in europe with its 19 635 km of pipe distribution network some studies alcalde and gawlik 2014 regione 2012 raso 2013 levine and asano 2004 show that the improvement of urban wastewater treatment as consequence of population growth and tourism would increase the regional annual wáter availability for irrigation by 60 million m3 about 10 of the overall irrigation water demand arborea et al 2017 such a supplemental source of wáter would help satisfy agriculture needs which is a high demand in this semi arid region while an attractive option use of reclaimed water for irrigation has important issues that must be addressed for example salinity and over application of nutrients are problems associated with reclaimed water irrigation in arid and semi arid environments soil salinization is a major threat in fruit trees since they are among the most salt sensitive horticultural crops fao 1985 approximately 6 of world cultivated land has salinity problems where nacl is usually the most abundant and soluble salt hasegawa et al 2000 munns and tester 2008 in apulia region it has been estimated that regional farmers have drilled more than 200 000 wells whose extensive exploitation of groundwater resources is causing the progressive salinization and depletion of relevant portions of the regional aquifers reducing the quality and availability of water for agriculture this phenomenon is particularly relevant along the coastline where a sharp increase in salinity of the groundwater has been recorded with peaks as high as 2 ds m 1 maggiore et al 2001 nectarine production has a growing economic importance worldwide and in southern italy the apulia region is the leading producer for nectarine both fruit quantity and quality are important as other factors like early ripening deficit irrigation and yield variability zarini 2014 in regards to variability several studies focusing on precision irrigation on peach fruit quality and quantity have been done for example deficit irrigation strategies elnesr et al 2016 have shown that fruit quality particulary the soluble solid content has been improved pliakoni and nanos 2010 but such a quality improvement can lead to a yield reduction at least to some extent abrisqueta et al 2010 rufat et al 2010 deficit irrigation strategies can also cause fruit peel stress reduction on vitamin c and carotenoids and an increase in the phenolic content mainly anthocyanins and procyanidins buendía et al 2008 in general stone fruit crops tend to manifest a moderate to high sensitivity to salinity several interesting studies have been conducted in prunus but with artificial salty irrigation water gainza et al 2015 massai et al 2004 which simulates increased salt content in reclaimed water on irrigation water quality effects on peach fruit quality especially reclaimed water experiments are limited or too old basiouny 1984 lurie et al 1996 or focus on fruit safety vivaldi et al 2013 or short term effects on fruit quality vivaldi et al 2017 for that reason the aim of this work was to study the effects of reclaimed water on the fruit quality and yield in drip irrigated nectarine trees over a three year duration 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a three year study 2012 2014 was carried out in a comercial nectarine grove prunus persica l batsch cv big top grafted on gf 677 the grove was planted in 2008 and is located in trinitapoli apulia region southern italy 41 22 92 n 16 03 16 27 e altitude 1m the climate of the experimental area is classified as semiarid like the 75 3 of the region kapur et al 2010 the planting density was 400 trees ha 1 with 5 m spacing between rows and 5 m between trees the trees were vase shaped trained the soil was sandy loam and was classified as vertisol gleysols fao the main physical and chemical characteristics of the soil are reported in vivaldi et al 2013 a total of 80 trees were used in this study the experimental design was a randomized complete design with 4 blocks and four experimental plots per block one per each irrigation water source the standard plot was made up of 5 trees located in 4 adjacent rows the three central trees of the middle row were used for measurements and the other 2 trees were guard trees fertilizers were applied taking into account nectarine nutrient requirements 102 27 0 kg ha 1 of n2 p2o5 k2o respectively all other agricultural practices pruning weed and pest control were performed following the regional production best good practices the climatic conditions were almost similar during the experimental period 2012 2014 with an average temperature of 17 c 67 relative humidity and rainfall around 500 mm rainfall was more variable during the irrigation period may september from 90 4 mm during 2012 to nearly double the amount i e 176 2 mm in 2014 for that reason the amount of irrigation water applied in 2013 and 2014 were higher respect to 2012 3100 4024 and 3715 m3 ha 1 respectively 2 2 irrigation water sources management and quality two water sources were used in the experiment the first water source was a reclaimed water from a tertiary treated wastewater rw produced by membrane filtration from a wastewater treatment plant located near the experimental site more technical details are described in vivaldi et al 2013 this treatment was compared with fresh water source fw from the marana capacciotti dam which served as the control trees were irrigated by drip irrigation with drip lines suspended along rows on the trees 1 70 m above the soil surface two self compensating drippers delivered water at 12 l h 1 to each tree the distance of the drippers from the trunk was 1 m the irrigation volume has been calculated by the water balance method with restitution of 100 crop evapotranspiration etc lost in each irrigation interval etc was calculated using eq 1 recommended by fao 1 etc kr kc et0 were kr is reduction coefficient kr 0 75 kc 0 50 kcini 1 15 kcmid 0 85 kcend is crop coefficient et0 is reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated by penman monteith equation and directly provided by assocodipuglia www agrometeopuglia it nine water samples from each irrigation water source were collected yearly during the irrigation period may september between 2012 and 2014 in order to characterize irrigation water quality throughout the irrigation season the water analysis were done as reported in vivaldi et al 2017 rw had almost triple the salinity with electrical conductivity ec values close to 1 5 ds m 1 vs 0 5 ds m 1 for that of fw the sar of the rw 3 0 was double that of the fw table 1 the higher salinity level observed in rw was mainly due to the high concentration of cl 161 4 mg l 1 and na 4 8 meq l 1 table 1 although ca mg and so4 were also more concentrated in rw rw also had higher concentrations of nutrients than fw specially macronutrients no3 po4 and k that were 2 28 and 5 times higher in rw respectively 2 3 fruit measurements 2 3 1 fruits yield and quality fruit yield and number of fruits per tree were measured from 12 trees in each treatment from 2012 to 2014 as peaches do not mature all at once were established three commercial harvests periods during the julian days 190 195 and 200 in 2012 183 191 and 199 in 2013 and 182 190 and 198 in 2014 based on firmness and the marketing of the grower samples 180 fruits for each treatment were randomly collected by hand in the middle part of the tree fresh weight g equatorial diameters mm flesh firmness f kg cm 2 soluble solids content ssc brix titratable acidity ta mg l 1 ph and maturity index mi were determined in the laboratory one day after harvest flesh firmness was measured with an 8 mm tip penetrometer effegi milan italy on two peeled surfaces on opposite sides of the equatorial region of the fruit ssc and ta

calculating the result as malic acid mg l 1 the ph values were measured using a ph meter crison 507 crison instruments s a barcelona spain mi calculated as the ssc ta ratio was used as an indication of fruit maturity at field harvest 2 4 specific fruit quality measurements specific fruit quality parameters have been measured only during the last experimental year antioxidant activity total phenols respiration rate o quinones and total sugar were analyzed during the three harvest times 2 4 1 respiration rate the respiration rate was measured using a closed system as reported by kader 2002 in detail 3 4 fruits around 400 500 g for each replicate were placed into 6 l sealed plastic jars one jar replicate which were closed and co2 was allowed to accumulate up to 0 1 the time taken to reach this threshold was measured by monitoring the co2 concentration at regular time intervals for co2 analysis 1 ml of gas sample was taken from the head space of the plastic jars through a rubber septum and injected into a gas chromatograph p200 micro gc agilent santa clara ca usa equipped with a thermal conductivity detector carbon dioxide was analyzed using a retention time of 16 s and a total run time of 120 s on a 10 m porous polymer ppu column agilent santa clara ca usa at a constant temperature of 70 c the respiration rate of the nectarines was measured on detached fruits at room temperature about 20 22 c theresults were expressed as ml co2 kg 1 h 1 2 4 2 extraction and analysis of antioxidant activity and total phenols the following extraction procedure was used for antioxidant activity and total phenols pace et al 2011 specifically 5 g of chopped sample for each replicate was homogenized in a methanol water solution 80 20 v v for 1 min and then centrifuged at 5 c at 6440 g for 5 min for dpph assay the extract diluted in water 50 μl was pipetted into 0 95 ml of dpph solution to initiate the reaction the absorbance at 515 nm was measured after about 15 min results were expressed as trolox equivalents mg trolox 100 g fw 1 using a trolox calibration curve 82 625 μm r2 0 99 total phenols were measured using the folin ciocalteu method reported by heimler et al 2007 results were expressed as milligrams of gallic acid equivalent gae per 100 g of fw material the calibration curve of gallic acid was prepared with five points from 50 to 500 mg l 1 with r 2 0 99 2 4 3 o quinones determination soluble o q in fruit tissues were extracted as described by ke and saltveit 1986 with low modifications by homogenized 5 g of tissues with 20 ml of methanol 80 the homogenate was filtered through four layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged at 6440 g for 5 min the supernatant was used directly to measure the soluble o q at a wavelength of 437 nm 2 4 4 total sugars content total sugars were determined by a phenol sulfuric colorimetric method reported by pace et al 2014 five grams of chopped nectarines were homogenized with 15 ml of 95 ethanol for 2 min and centrifuged for 5 min at 6440 g the extract was diluted and was used for the measurement color development was determined at 490 nm and glucose was used as the standard 2 5 leaf measurements to perform the analyses spring flush leaves from non fruiting twigs located in the central part of the tree were sampled each season every three months twenty leaves per tree were sampled in the twelve inner trees per treatment dried leaf tissues were milled into fine pieces 1 2 mm and approximately 0 5 g of each sample was extracted with 1 ml 30 h2o2 and 9 ml concentrated hno3 using microwave assisted pressure digestion total cu fe mn zn ca k mg na and p were determined on these leaves extracts by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry on dried leaves tissues total n was also quantified through kjeldahl method 2 6 soil measurements soil samples were collected from four replicate treatments 3 times a year from three soil depths 0 0 2 0 2 0 4 and 0 4 0 6 m the ece was measured with a multi range cryson hi8734 electrical conductivity meter crison instruments s a barcelona spain soluble ca and mg were measured using the edta titration method and na was measured using a flame photometer richards 1954 the sodium adsorption ratio sare was then calculated from the concentration of na ca and mg measured in the saturated paste extract 3 statistical analysis statistical

tukey s hsd test p 0 05 was used for mean separation 4 results and discussion 4 1 irrigation water quality the water quality was different between the irrigation water sources the values of these parameters were significantly higher in rw than in fw table 1 most woody fruit and nut crops are salt sensitive even in the absence of specific ion effects in particular nectarine trees are considered salt sensitive crops but in both treatments the values did not exceeded the threshold for significant yield losses 1 5 2 ds m 1 ayers and westcot 1985 maas and grattan 1999 a significant portion of nutrients applied in the field is not taken up by plants and is lost through leaching volatilisation nitrification or other means timilsena et al 2015 macro and meso nutrients in rw could allow for a significant reduction in fertilizer application while still meeting tree nutrient requirements as has been seen on fruit trees studies vivaldi et al 2017 pedrero et al 2014 bearing in mind the higher concentration of nutrients in rw and whether or not the fertigation program had been adjusted to account for these increases rw could have provided 4 kg no3 ha 1 44 kg po4 ha 1 84 kg k ha 1 300 kg ca ha 1 60 kg mg ha 1 and 360 kg so4 ha 1 this quantities must be taken into account on the fertirrigation plan to avoid plant injuries detrimental effects caused by specific ion toxicities interactions and soil and groundwater pollution grattan and grieve 1998 4 2 fruit quality in general fruit quality parameters of nectarines such as ssc ta ph f and mi were affected by the type of water used in this experiment table 2 fruits from trees treated with rw water showed higher values on most of the fruit quality parameters during the entire experiment 2012 2014 especially ph and mi these elevated levels were due primarily due to the higher nutrient concentration and salinity of the rw water table 2 in fact many plants adapt to salt stress by enhanced biosynthesis of secondary metabolites such as soluble solids sugars organic acids proteins and amino acids which act as osmolytes to maintain plant turgor under salt stress the presence of these metabolites often increase the nutritive quality and marketability of fruits and vegetables ahlem et al 2011 ahmed et al 2009 it has been demonstrated on different crops tomatoes muskmelon and cucumber that fruit quality parameters such as ssc improved in fruits irrigated with rw biernbaum and argo 1995 pedrero et al 2012 lurie et al 1996 basiouny 1984 under different irrigation regimes lower firmness values in rw treated fruits were observed during the three years as compared to fw treated fruits particularly the last year 5 36 and 5 06 kg cm 2 respectively table 2 this finding was not corroborated on similar fruit trees species on a study conducted by lurie et al 1996 the lower firmness values on rw treated fruits compared to fw can suggest early ripening on fruit trees as was seen the first year vivaldi et al 2017 on peach trees basiouny 1984 showed earlier flowering maturity and ripening on rw treated fruits this study indicates that even being not a high saline reclaimed irrigation water fruit quality parameters can be directly affect because other factors but further long term studies are still needed to demonstrate the effects of rw on such fruit quality parameters and their affect on marketability scandella et al 1997 4 3 specific fruit quality parameters the european union registered a consumption of about 10 7 billion litres of juices in 2011 and a great part of this amount is imported from other countries which makes the monitoring of their quality essential especially total phenolics that have been demostrated to be the main contributors to the antioxidant activity granato et al 2015 the effect of irrigation treatment fw or rw on respiration rate o quinones total sugar antioxidant capacity total phenols of nectarine fruits collected at the three commercial harvest period 182 190 and 198 julian days are reported in table 3 no significant difference in respiration rates were observed at the first and second harvest whereas a slight significant increase was found at final harvest time in rw treated plants regarding the o quinones and total sugar content a significat increase was observed in rw treated fruit but only at the first harvest the value of total phenols was significantly higher in rw treated fruit at the first and second harvest whereas only at first and at the final harvest time was the antioxidant capacity significantly higher in rw treated fruit because the rw treatment had a higher salinity content mild saline stress probably activated secondary metabolic processes resulting in the biosynthesis of phenolic substances that also resulted in an increase in antioxidant activity ramakrishna and aswathanarayana 2011 gil et al 2002 lee and kader 2000 4 4 leaves nutritional status although the soil salinity increased as a result of both treatments the leaf na concentration remained below the toxiciy threshold 0 10 g kg 1 for the entire study table 4 the most popular rootstocks used in peach orchards are gn15 and gf 677 and these are less sensitive to na toxicity than is bitter almond najafian et al 2008 the low na concentration in the leaves under mild salt stress conditions can be explained by rootstock gf 677 ability to restrict na accumulation in the leaves najafian et al 2008 leaf cl concentration was up to the máximum tolerable concentration in both treatments walsh and steinhilber 2005 especially those treated with rw where leaf cl concentration was triple table 4 our results confirm previous reports that for prunus most of leaf toxicity is due to cl rather than na and leaf cl concentration increased linearly as external nacl concentration increased najafian et al 2008 this toxic anion cl appears to have a determinant role in the sensitivity of fruit trees to soil salinity and although no toxicity symptoms were observed the increased uptake of cl can lead to its build up to toxic levels najafian et al 2008 besides the osmotic potential effect fruit trees are also very sensitive to leaf cl and na toxic concentrations depending on rootstocks and cultivars aragüés et al 2014 there has been little documentation on the effect of soil salinity on leaf na and cl concentration in nectarine trees although cl concentrations of above 0 005 g kg 1 leaf dry weight and na concentrations above 0 002 0 003 g kg 1 typically cause toxicity problems in most deciduous fruit trees bernstein 1980 boland et al 1993 saline conditions can rapidly reduce the capacity of roots to absorb essential nutrients from the soil türkana and demiral 2009 sodium ions have been shown to cause disturbances in calcium and potassium nutrition läuchli and grattan 2014 in this experiment potassium concentration on rw irrigation water was almost five times higher than fw and calcium concentrations were double table 1 but excess sodium in the soil solution did not affect leaf ca or k concentrations as has been observed in other experiments grattan and grieve 1998 leaf ca concentration was at the recomended limits under both treatments 0 35 g kg 1 walsh and steinhilber 2005 table 4 as other salinity studies with prunus najafian et al 2008 it seems that the rate of decrease in k na ratio had inverse relationship with the rate of rootstocks resistance so the k na ratio under saline conditions could be considered a selection criteria in prunus rootstock najafian et al 2008 chloride concentration on rw treatment leaves was higher than fw treatment the nitrogen content in leaves in our study was no significant difference between treatments this result is not in accordance with other studies that found to reduce nitrate uptake by crops with high leaf chloride concentration grattan and grieve 1998 no difference in carbon content was seen maybe because of the rootstock it was studied that gf 677 rootstock has a photochemical limitation to photosynthesis najafian et al 2008 boron concentration was under the toxicity levels in both treatments 0 05 g kg 1 walsh and steinhilber 2005 but this is not surprising as nectarine is classified as a b mobile tree brown and shelp 1997 and boron tends to remobilize from leaves to young developing tissues boron toxicity in fruit trees is more common on arid and semi arid environments pedrero et al 2014 but symptoms manifest themselves as twig dieback and gum exudation rather than foliar necrosis brown and shelp 1997 the leaf concentrations for the rest of the micronutrients analyzed zn fe cr cu al and mn were all within the recommended range for both treatments data not shown 4 5 soil salinization and sodicity risks the initial soil salinity ece on the studied soil sandy loam on 2012 at 0 20 cms was high 2 8 ds m 1 due to its close proximity to the saline lagoons only 1 km and the level of the sea groundwater table pta 2002 the two sources of saline pollution seawater intrusión or lagoon intrusion and underground feeds affect the entire perimeter of the hydrogeological unit cotecchia et al 2005 although the irrigation water used previously to the study in the agronomic area during a long term was not salty groundwater table has a high sea salts concentration it has been demostrated that soil water and salt migrations are closely associated with groundwater table groundwater reaches soil layers by capillary upward flow and then may enter the soil water cycle wang et al 2015 in the top 20 cm there is a clear salt accumulation increase on rw treatment from 2 51 to 3 64 ds m 1 72 whereas in fw treatment the ece is keep into the initial soil values 2 5 3 ds m 1 fig 1 on the next layer 20 40 cm salts were acumulated in both treatments at the same level at the end of the experiment around 5 ds m 1 fig 1 on the last depth 40 60 cm salts continued increasing being more pronounced in this case on fw than in rw treatment reaching values as 7 5 and 6 ds m 1 respectively fig 1 overall both irrigation with rw and tw significantly increased ece 120 and 135 respectively but such increases were spacially variable within the soil profile while salts were acumulated at lowest depths in plots irrigated with fw salts where acumulated in the upper portion of the profile in rw treated plots elevated salt concentration within the root zone when trees are irrigated with reclaimed water with similar quality characteristics has been demostrated in different experiments pedrero et al 2014 nicolás et al 2016 the sodicity risk was assesed according to the level of sodium adsorption rate sare calculated after the sodium calcium and magnesium concentration measured in the saturated paste extract on the first layer the sare followed the same distribution than ece the sare of rw treated plots increased seasonally reaching values of 16 while those treated with fw were significantly less 9 fig 2 at the deepest layers a clear leaching phenomenon was observed in plots irrigated with both treatments because as with the ece the sare of rw treated plots decreases by 62 while the fw treatment increased by 130 fig 2 although the sare is not the best indicator for leaching phenomenon rengasamy 2010 in this case it s correlation with ece showed to be a good leaching indicator with these results the experimental soil can be classified as saline sodic because of the dominance of sodium salts sare 6 in saline and sodic soils the solubility of micronutrients e g cu fe mn and zn is particularly low and plants grown in these soils often experience deficiencies in these elements page et al 1990 transient salinity in soils characterised by a high concentration of salts in the subsoil change with depth and throughout the season in response to rainfall surface evaporation and water used by vegetation resulting in different leaching fraction at different layers rengasamy 2016 long term studies are necessary to get better knowledge of the leaching requirements for nectarine to avoid salinity problems and sodicity hazards that could lead to soil degradation ayers and westcot 1985 4 6 yield response bernstein 1980 specified that the yield of peach trees decreases by 10 at an ece of 2 5 ds m 1 in the absence of specific ion effects this osmotic effect is based on the vegetative response of young shoots from young trees maas and hoffman 1977 on the other hand reported that peach fruit weight and the number of peach fruits per tree were reduced by about 50 at an average rootzone ece of about 3 ds m 1 when the soil solution was dominated by cl salts in our case although the high soil salinity levels found on both treatments but specially on first layer in rw only yield differences were found during the first year table 5 the yield difference during 2012 comparing with 2013 and 2014 was because of the third comercial harvest period was lost due to the comercial prunning applied by the grower as a cultural practice the rw treatment reduced the number of fruits significantly as compared to those treated with fw table 5 the individual fruit weight was higher on rw treatment table 5 alsothe percentage of fruits within the desirable comercial caliber 60 64 were also higher than those treated with fw 7 5 to 5 respectively fig 3 this larger fruit size related to a reduction in the number of fruits in trees irrigated with reclaimed water was refered on other similar studies on fruit trees under mediterranean conditions nicolás et al 2016 pedrero et al 2014 pedrero et al 2012 in this sense the smaller crop load can result in an improved marketable yield under severe water stress marsal et al 2010 5 conclusions soil salinity increase can be the main barrier from the sustainability point of view but the interaction between rw nutrients and salinity can be the responsable on fruit quality improvement the other important point is that a tendency toward greater fruit weight and size was observed in rw treatments so the use of reclaimed water can improve the marketable yield with early ripening nevertheless further studies are needed to demonstrate the beneficial effects of rw on necarine fruit quality parameters and the marketable increase in fruit quality however caution must be exercised when changing from surface to reclaimed water the age of the trees and the soil conditions can greatly affect the response of an orchard acknowledgments the authors wish to thank the italian ministry of education university and research miur for its financial support

11479,liquid manure applied on the soil surface may alter its hydraulic conductivity by surface sealing in this study we evaluated the chemical and physical mechanisms of the surface sealing process acting in sandy clay loam and clayey soils after liquid manure application ldm factors affecting surface sealing such as ldm dosage total solids content of ldm straw cover and time after ldm application were also studied the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat was determined before and 24 h and 7 days after ldm application and the sealing index was calculated the liquid dairy manure application on the soil surface promoted surface sealing in both soils around 93 of sealing surface was due to physical mechanisms and around 7 chemical mechanisms the application of ldm with 9 4 total solids ts promoted a greater sealing index greater surface sealing compared to ldm with 0 ts mainly within 24 h of ldm application greater surface sealing was also observed with a higher ldm dose 60 m3 ha 1 soil cover with 5 mg ha 1 of straw resulted in a lower sealing index lower surface sealing than soil with 0 mg ha 1 of straw sealing index was greatest at 24 h after ldm application for all treatments solids content ldm dose and soil cover in both soils clayey and sandy clay loam the clayey soil was more susceptible to surface sealing after ldm application than the sandy clay loam in practical terms application of ldm with a high total solids content to bare soil when followed by rainfall 24 h after ldm application enhanced susceptibility to surface sealing and consequently greater detrimental effect on surface water quality keywords no till organic fertilisation soil cover soil crusting clay dispersion 1 introduction hydraulic conductivity at the soil surface and infiltration capacity are two factors that determine the amount of runoff resulting from a rainfall event and are greatly affected by surface sealing soil surface sealing is characterised by the presence of a thin layer of high density and low porosity hillel 1998 sumner and stewart 1992 and usually occurs after heavy rainfall events badorreck et al 2013 jakab et al 2013 however the application of liquid manure also promotes surface sealing influencing water infiltration and contributing to the occurrence of soil water and nutrient losses cherobim et al 2017 mori et al 2009 smith et al 2007 surface sealing with application of liquid manure can involve physical chemical and biological mechanisms culley and phillips 1986 cihan et al 2006 physical clogging of pores by the particulate present in the liquid manure is the main mechanism by which soil surface sealing occurs chang et al 1974 detar 1979 rowsell et al 1985 barrington et al 1987 both the total solid content of the animal slurry and the total load application dose influence the above mentioned pore clogging and thus infiltration and runoff rates cherobim et al 2015 mori et al 2009 in contrast the contribution of chemical mechanisms to surface sealing by liquid manure application is negligible and depends mainly on manure ph and concentration of dispersant elements present in the manure barrington et al 1987 on the other hand a clay dispersion by chemical forces would be a problem in soil with saline sodic wastewater application halliwell et al 2001 tillman and surapaneni 2002 the dispersed particles move through the soil profile clogging the pore spaces and causing surface sealing irvine and reid 2001 the chemical mechanism involved in surface sealing through the clay dispersion can be influenced by factors such as soil texture and mineralogy ph aggregates building agents and soil sodicity balks et al 1998 shainberg 1992 seal formation on cultivated soil begins with the breakdown of surface aggregates and the physical dispersion forces are influenced by the raindrop impact bradford and huang 1992 straw mulch is a sustainable management strategy that reduces surface sealing and consequently runoff and erosion since the straw protects the soil surface from the effect of raindrop impact and improves soil stability bradford and huang 1992 prosdocimi et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 in a study using rainfall simulation it was observed that greatest pore clogging at the soil surface occurred with conventional tillage no soil cover compared to conservation tillage rosa et al 2013 soil cover straw for example with surface application of liquid manure will act as a protective layer which will retain the manure particles thus avoiding clogging of pore spaces the interval between manure application and a rainfall event affects the surface sealing and consequently the water infiltration process in the short term less than four days after liquid manure application the hydrologic characteristics were affected by surface sealing promoted by fine manure particles edwards and daniel 1993 however in the long term greater than four days after the liquid manure application soil hydraulic conductivity can return to a value that approximates its initial value probably due to drying of the liquid manure that partially unclogged the surface pores chang et al 1974 edwards and daniel 1993 de vries 1972 the objective of this study was to clarify the process associated with soil surface sealing after application of liquid dairy manure ldm to sandy clay loam and clayey soils under a no till system more specifically our study aimed to ascertain the impact of the following factors on saturated hydraulic conductivity due to surface sealing caused by ldm application i the relative contribution of physical and chemical mechanisms ii the effect of total solids content of ldm iii the effect of soil cover straw iv the effect of time after ldm application 2 material and methods 2 1 soil characterisation the soil samples were collected from two experimental fields one field in castro 24 51 50 s and 49 56 25 w and one in ponta grossa 25 00 35 s 50 09 16 w these fields had been cultivated under crop rotation involving soybean glycine max maize zea mays oats avena spp and wheat triticum aestivum and managed with a no till system for more than 20 years the soils table 1 were classified as oxisol according to the us soil taxonomy soil survey staff 1999 corresponding to the brazilian soil taxonomy embrapa 2013 classification as a latosol with clayey texture castro and sandy clay loam texture ponta grossa 2 2 experimental design and treatments undisturbed soil samples were collected using a cylinder of 49 mm diameter from the 0 53 mm upper layer the study consisted of two experiments clayey soil and sandy clay loam soil with the same experimental design and treatments used for both the experimental design was completely randomised with five replicates the treatments were two total solids ts contents of ldm 0 and 9 4 two doses of ldm 30 and 60 m3 ha 1 two soil covers 0 and 5 mg ha 1 of oat straw arranged in a 2 2 2 factorial scheme with a total of eight treatments the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat was determined with deionised water before ldm application and 24 h and 7 days after ldm application each soil cylinder consisted of a single sample which was analysed before and after ldm application the treatment involving application of ldm containing 9 4 ts table 2 was performed to determine physical and chemical mechanisms application of ldm containing 0 ts filtered using a 0 45 μm membrane filter was performed to determine chemical mechanisms the physical mechanism was determined as the difference between the treatment with ldm containing 9 4 ts and the treatment with ldm free of ts the saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured using the method of falling head permeameter reynolds and elrick 2002 details of the methodology were reported by cavalieri et al 2009 sealing index si was used to indicate soil surface sealing promoted by ldm application a higher si value indicates a greater effect of surface sealing si was calculated as si k sat before ldm application k sat after ldm application where si is the sealing index and ksat is the saturated hydraulic conductivity 2 3 statistical analysis preliminary statistical analysis indicated that the data required logarithmic transformation base10 to achieve the assumption required for anova anova and tukey s test p 0 05 for mean comparison procedures were performed using the statistica 10 software statsoft 2011 3 results with both soil types at 24 h after ldm application a higher si value indicating greater surface sealing was found with application of ldm containing 9 4 ts compared to 0 ts fig 1 a b the si value with ldm containing 0 ts was around 93 less therefore considering that ldm 0 ts reflects only the chemical mechanism and that ldm 9 4 ts reflects the physical plus chemical mechanisms it can be concluded that around 7 of the surface sealing was due to the chemical mechanisms and 93 the physical mechanism at 7 days after ldm application the si value also was significantly greater with ldm 9 4 ts than ldm 0 ts around 40 in clayey soil and 60 in sandy clay loam soil fig 1a b however comparing the intervals after ldm application the si value surface sealing with application of ldm 9 4 was much greater after 24 h than after 7 days 91 greater in clayey soil and 77 in sandy clay loam soil the ldm dose data fig 1c d shows greater surface sealing a higher si value with application of 60 m3 ha 1 ldm at 24 h after ldm application in both soils the decrease in the si value with 30 m3 ha 1 ldm when compared to 60 m3 ha 1 was around 55 with clayey soil and 63 with sandy clay loam soil soil cover straw at both intervals after ldm application 24 h and 7 days affected surface sealing in clayey soil and sandy clay loam soil fig 1e f the higher si values occurred at 24 h after ldm application with 0 mg ha 1 of straw comparison of the presence or absence of straw on the soil surface 0 and 5 mg ha 1 5 mg ha 1 of straw decreased the si values by around 70 with clayey soil and 81 with sandy clay loam soil showing a positive effect of the straw on decreasing surface sealing mainly in sandy clay loam soil at 7 days after ldm application si values also were greater with 0 mg ha 1 than with 5 mg ha 1 of straw comparing the soils the clayey soil was more affected by ldm application than the sandy clay loam soil mainly at 24 h after application fig 1 for total solids content the si value in clayey soil was around 50 greater than sandy clay loam soil with both ts contents 0 and 9 4 ts for the ldm dose the si value increased by 58 with ldm 30 m3 ha 1 and 48 with ldm 60 m3 ha 1 while for soil cover the increase in si value was 46 with 0 mg ha 1 of straw and 65 with 5 mg ha 1 of straw 4 discussion the ts content of ldm plays an important role in the surface sealing process because it defines the contribution of each mechanism involved in sealing it is assumed in this study that ldm containing 9 4 ts defines the physical plus chemical mechanism while ldm containing 0 ts defines the chemical mechanism no clogging of pores will occur by manure solid particles in this condition the results fig 1a b indicated that surface sealing was dominated by a physical mechanism involving clogging of pores due the fine particulate material present in the liquid manure maulé et al 2000 mostaghimi et al 1989 roberts and clanton 2000 rowsell et al 1985 the contribution of the chemical mechanism to surface sealing was not significant in the present study chemical forces acting on clay dispersion causing seal formation would be predominant with saline sodic wastewater application shainberg 1992 halliwell et al 2001 tillman and surapaneni 2002 the sealing promoted by the chemical mechanism was possibly due to ph and cation exchange capacity increase caused by organic compounds and due to the presence of dispersant elements na and k table 2 which enabled the clay dispersion barrington et al 1987 the ldm dose affected surface sealing fig 1c d mainly at 24 h after ldm application showing the importance of an adequate interval after manure application study with ldm doses and water infiltration showed that the increase in ldm dose applied on the soil surface affected the hydraulic conductivity decreasing the water infiltration mainly a short time 1 day after manure application cherobim et al 2015 in general surface sealing decreased at 7 days after ldm application fig 1 and this can be explained by the drying of the ldm partially unclogging the surface pores and allowing the recovery of hydraulic conductivity back to the original unamended ksat value chang et al 1974 edwards and daniel 1993 de vries 1972 the presence of straw on the soil surface is important for protecting the soil surface from the effects of raindrop impact donjadeea and tingsanchalib 2016 in the case of liquid manure application straw also prevents direct contact of manure with the pore space and consequently prevents surface sealing and the decrease in hydraulic conductivity fig 1e f soil texture plays an important role in surface sealing the breakdown of soil aggregates caused by raindrop impact and clay dispersion caused by chemical forces are closely dependent on clay content and mineralogy seal formation occurs more readily on sandy loams than on clay loams due to the lower aggregate stability of the former bradford and huang 1992 shainberg 1992 however in this study the difference in si values between the soils fig 1 indicates that the surface sealing by ldm application in the clayey soil was greater than in sandy clay loam soil in this study without raindrop impact it appears that the clay soil was more affected by clogging of micropores due the fine particulate material present in the liquid manure 5 conclusions application of liquid dairy manure on the soil surface promotes surface sealing the physical mechanism was the main mechanism acting on surface sealing in clayey and sandy clay loam soils the clayey soil was more susceptible to surface sealing by ldm application the worst conditions for surface sealing was at an interval of 24 h after ldm application higher total solids content of ldm 9 4 ts higher dose of ldm 60 m3 ha 1 and less soil cover 0 mg ha 1 of straw acknowledgements authors are grateful to national council for scientiﬁc and

soil and sandy clay loam soil fig 1e f the higher si values occurred at 24 h after ldm application with 0 mg ha 1 of straw comparison of the presence or absence of straw on the soil surface 0 and 5 mg ha 1 5 mg ha 1 of straw decreased the si values by around 70 with clayey soil and 81 with sandy clay loam soil showing a positive effect of the straw on decreasing surface sealing mainly in sandy clay loam soil at 7 days after ldm application si values also were greater with 0 mg ha 1 than with 5 mg ha 1 of straw comparing the soils the clayey soil was more affected by ldm application than the sandy clay loam soil mainly at 24 h after application fig 1 for total solids content the si value in clayey soil was around 50 greater than sandy clay loam soil with both ts contents 0 and 9 4 ts for the ldm dose the si value increased by 58 with ldm 30 m3 ha 1 and 48 with ldm 60 m3 ha 1 while for soil cover the increase in si value was 46 with 0 mg ha 1 of straw and 65 with 5 mg ha 1 of straw 4 discussion the ts content of ldm plays an important role in the surface sealing process because it defines the contribution of each mechanism involved in sealing it is assumed in this study that ldm containing 9 4 ts defines the physical plus chemical mechanism while ldm containing 0 ts defines the chemical mechanism no clogging of pores will occur by manure solid particles in this condition the results fig 1a b indicated that surface sealing was dominated by a physical mechanism involving clogging of pores due the fine particulate material present in the liquid manure maulé et al 2000 mostaghimi et al 1989 roberts and clanton 2000 rowsell et al 1985 the contribution of the chemical mechanism to surface sealing was not significant in the present study chemical forces acting on clay dispersion causing seal formation would be predominant with saline sodic wastewater application shainberg 1992 halliwell et al 2001 tillman and surapaneni 2002 the sealing promoted by the chemical mechanism was possibly due to ph and cation exchange capacity increase caused by organic compounds and due to the presence of dispersant elements na and k table 2 which enabled the clay dispersion barrington et al 1987 the ldm dose affected surface sealing fig 1c d mainly at 24 h after ldm application showing the importance of an adequate interval after manure application study with ldm doses and water infiltration showed that the increase in ldm dose applied on the soil surface affected the hydraulic conductivity decreasing the water infiltration mainly a short time 1 day after manure application cherobim et al 2015 in general surface sealing decreased at 7 days after ldm application fig 1 and this can be explained by the drying of the ldm partially unclogging the surface pores and allowing the recovery of hydraulic conductivity back to the original unamended ksat value chang et al 1974 edwards and daniel 1993 de vries 1972 the presence of straw on the soil surface is important for protecting the soil surface from the effects of raindrop impact donjadeea and tingsanchalib 2016 in the case of liquid manure application straw also prevents direct contact of manure with the pore space and consequently prevents surface sealing and the decrease in hydraulic conductivity fig 1e f soil texture plays an important role in surface sealing the breakdown of soil aggregates caused by raindrop impact and clay dispersion caused by chemical forces are closely dependent on clay content and mineralogy seal formation occurs more readily on sandy loams than on clay loams due to the lower aggregate stability of the former bradford and huang 1992 shainberg 1992 however in this study the difference in si values between the soils fig 1 indicates that the surface sealing by ldm application in the clayey soil was greater than in sandy clay loam soil in this study without raindrop impact it appears that the clay soil was more affected by clogging of micropores due the fine particulate material present in the liquid manure 5 conclusions application of liquid dairy manure on the soil surface promotes surface sealing the physical mechanism was the main mechanism acting on surface sealing in clayey and sandy clay loam soils the clayey soil was more susceptible to surface sealing by ldm application the worst conditions for surface sealing was at an interval of 24 h after ldm application higher total solids content of ldm 9 4 ts higher dose of ldm 60 m3 ha 1 and less soil cover 0 mg ha 1 of straw acknowledgements authors are grateful to national council for scientiﬁc and
