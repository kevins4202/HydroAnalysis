3540,riparian ecosystems fundamentally depend on groundwater and thus accurate estimates of daily groundwater evapotranspiration rate etg is curial for understanding the interactions between groundwater and vegetation up to now various methods i e white 1932 hays 2003 soylu et al 2012 have been proposed to estimate daily etg using the water table fluctuations the objective of this paper was to evaluate and compare their performances under various water table conditions in field environments for this purpose we employed a variety of measurements i e water table levels latent heat flux and soil water contents at a riparian forest t ramosissima in northwest china in 2017 our results showed that the white method is suitable for use during the water table declining periods also the selected time intervals could have impacts on the estimations of etg the soylu method and the hays method performed well under various water table conditions thus it seems that the hays and soylu methods are more suitable for long term etg estimates in field environments in addition the percentage of plant transpired water from groundwater varied during the growing seasons the riparian plants mainly use soil water during the early growing stages and it tended to use groundwater during the late growing stages in the future more isotope based studies were needed to verify the seasonal patterns of water uptake of the riparian forest keywords riparian forest groundwater evapotranspiration water table fluctuation specific yield the white method the soylu method the hays method 1 introduction drylands make up over 40 of the earth s land surface reynolds et al 2007 in these arid and semiarid landscapes riparian ecosystems play an important role in protecting biodiversity maintaining ecological balance and providing important ecosystem services for people rohde et al 2021 many riparian plant species are phreatophytes and fundamentally depend on groundwater for survival grime 1977 smith et al 1998 eamus et al 2015 mayes et al 2002 naumburg et al 2005 thus accurate estimate of the amount of groundwater consumed by vegetation evapotranspiration etg is critical for fully understanding the interactions between groundwater and vegetation and for the management of regional groundwater resources orellana et al 2012 over the past several decades increased attentions have been given to the use of diurnal water table fluctuations to quantify etg at daily time scale and various methods have been proposed fahle ottfried 2014 in his original work white 1932 first proposed a method of estimating daily etg from diurnal water table fluctuations assuming constant daily groundwater recovery rate at the point of measurement based on the same fundamental assumption some new approaches have been developed to estimate etg at daily time scale for instance dolan et al 1984 proposed to calculate daily etg by using dual extrapolation of the nighttime groundwater recovery rate to noon in his doctoral thesis hays 2003 developed a new daily etg estimation method solely using extrema of the hydrograph soylu et al 2012 proposed a fourier based method to calculate daily etg by taking the full water table fluctuations into account we noticed that the dolan method can be converted to the white method by setting groundwater recovery rate to the mean value of the two nights and found that their performances were generally similar during our study period see supporting information a1 thus in this study we mainly focused on investigating the performances of the three distinct methods i e the white method the hays method and the soylu method in estimating daily etg based on diurnal water table fluctuations due to their simplicity and cost effectiveness these methods have been widely used in estimating daily etg over various ecosystems such as wetland hughes et al 2001 mazur et al 2014 savannah miller et al 2010 forests vincke thiry 2008 fan et al 2016 and riparian ecosystems in arid and semi arid regions yuan et al 2015 yue et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 nevertheless there are still some insufficiencies in systematic inter comparison and analysis of these methods in estimating daily etg first most previous studies mainly focused on evaluating the performances of one specific method at a particular site hughes et al 2001 vincke thiry 2008 miller et al 2010 mazur et al 2014 yuan et al 2015 fan et al 2016 yue et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 to our knowledge a systematic cross comparison of these methods on estimating daily etg has not been conducted in field environments second the performances of these methods in estimating daily etg are expected to differ due to their differences in complexities fahle ottfried 2014 to select the best suitable method for long term daily etg estimation it is needed to test their performances under various water table conditions finally identifying the percentage of plant transpired water from groundwater is crucial for ecological management of arid and semi arid ecosystems ehleringer et al 1998 lanning et al 2020 the isotopic techniques have been widely used in previous studies dawson pate 1996 zencich et al 2002 barbeta et al 2015 voltas et al 2015 tiemuerbieke et al 2018 however researches that comprehensively use water table fluctuations and flux measurements were relatively few with the exception of miller et al 2010 based on one year round observation of water table fluctuations soil moistures and fluxes measurements from the riparian forest in arid northwest china in 2017 the objectives of the present study were to 1 evaluate the performances of three daily etg estimation methods under various water table conditions in field environments 2 analysis the disagreement agreement between different methods and 3 identify the plant water uptake source during the whole growing period 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study site 101 1374oe 42 0012on 873 m

an automated pressure transducer hobo water level logger u20 onset computer corp usa was used to record the groundwater level below the surface at 30 min intervals the leaf area index lai a potential factor influencing plant activities was extracted from mod15a https modis ornl gov at 500 m spatial and 4 day temporal resolutions we used an average of four surrounding pixels around the ec flux tower to acquire the time series of lai during our study period 2 3 methods for estimating etg based on water table fluctuation theoretically the evapotranspiration et mm d 1 at our site could result from four water sources 1 groundwater 2 overflowing flood 3 precipitation and 4 soil water in the root layer therefore the total et over the riparian ecosystem was defined as 1 et et g et f et p et s where etg etf etp and ets all in mm d 1 are the daily evapotranspiration from groundwater flood water precipitation and soil water respectively because of the scarce precipitation in our site etp could be neglected during most of the time on the contrary there was one flood irrigation event at spring i e 22 april 2017 due to the implement of the ecological water diversion project ewdp by the local government during this period the other components of et i e etg etf and ets cannot be neglected however it is generally difficult to preciously calculate them because of the heterogeneities of the hydrological conditions i e ponding excessive percolation and inadequate wetting of the soil may concurrently occur in different areas in the field as the surface became dry et could only result from groundwater and soil water under such conditions ets could be calculated using the soil moisture balance equation see supporting information a2 here we mainly focused on introducing the three main etg estimate methods based on the water table fluctuations 2 3 1 white method in his original work white 1932 proposed a method of estimating daily total etg from groundwater hydrographs using the following equation 2 et g 24 r δ s s y where sy is the specific yield dimensionless of the groundwater bearing material in which the diurnal fluctuations are observed r is the net groundwater recovery inflow rate m h 1 and δs is the net rise or fall of groundwater level during the 24 h period m day 1 and the or in equation are used in the case of water table fall or rise respectively the groundwater recovery rate r is calculated from the slope of the best fit line to the hydrograph between midnight and 4 a m see supporting information a3 this methodology therefore assumes that r is constant throughout the day and that the interval between midnight and 4 00 a m is an appropriate period for estimating r values 2 3 2 hays method in his doctoral thesis hays 2003 proposed a new method for calculation of etg 3 et g h 1 l 1 h 2 l 1 t 2 t 1 s y where h 1 m is the maximum water level of the day under consideration l 1 m is the according minimum groundwater level h 2 m is the maximum of the following day t 2 h is the time span between h 1 and l 1 and t 1 h is the time span between l 1 and h 2 see supporting information a3 in the hays method the groundwater recovery rate is calculated in the subsequent night according to the second term in equation 2 and et is just considered between h 1 and l 1 2 3 3 soylu method soylu et al 2012 proposed a fourier based method to calculate etg by taking he full diurnal cycle into account in particular they applied a sine function with a period of 24 h across a multiday i e 1 7 days moving window of detrended groundwater level by fitting to the following time series function 4 h t a t d b sin 2 π t k 24 where a m h 1 is the multiday trend t h the time in hours d m is the mean bias b m is the diurnal amplitude and k h is the diurnal signal phase see supporting information a3 similar to the hays approach the daily etg is estimated as function of the daily peak to trough range 2b 5 et g s y k 2 b where k is a scaling factor which depends only on the shape and duration of the diurnal et curve it was found that the magnitude of k ranged from 1 6 to 2 2 with a mean of 1 9 soylu et al 2012 here k was set to the mean scaling factor of 1 9 2 4 specific yield estimates the specific yield s y is a critical parameter for the calculation of etg the uncertainty of s y is the major factor that causes the errors in etg estimation healy and cook 2002 in shallow water table environments s y has been found to be effected by soil textures and the depth to the water table see details in supporting information a2 in this study s y was calculated using the method proposed by loheide et al 2005 6 s y θ s θ r θ s θ r 1 α d n m where d m is water table depth θ s and θ r are saturated and residual soil moisture dimensionless α m 1 n dimensionless and m dimensionless are empirical coefficients used in the van genuchten 1980 model noticeably s y that obtained from equation 6 is referred to either as the apparent specific yield or the depth compensated specific yield fan et al 2014 loheide ii et al 2005 to obtain the s y value of the study area soil samples at three depth ranges 0 0 5 m 0 5 1 0 m and 1 0 1 5 m below the ground were collected the soil moisture curve of the soil samples was determined using a pressure plate extractor daiki 3404 daiki rika kogyo co ltd saitama japan to obtain important parameters used in the van genuchten model and the properties of the soil samples were analyzed using a mastersizer 2000 laser diffractometer malvern panalytical malvern uk the parameters for the silt loam soil at our site are estimated as follows θ s 0 38 m3 m 3 θ r 0 16 m3 m 3 α 0 85 m 1 n 1 23 and m 0 19 to verify the reasonability of this method we also use a monte carlo mc procedure to find the optimal s y values that would minimize the differences between observed and estimated total et see details in supporting information a2 2 5 statistical measures of the performances of different methods comparisons between different methods in estimating daily etg were performed by using the coefficient of determination r 2 slope b 0 and intercept b 1 of the linear regression of estimated daily etg between any two methods r 2 describes the degree of co linearity between two models and ranges between 0 and 1 with higher values indicating a good co linearity to determine whether any methods significantly differed from each other we used one way analysis of variance anova with tukey s honest significant difference hsd post hoc test the hsd post hoc test is a step down procedure for testing all possible subset homogeneity hypotheses in pairwise fashion differences referred to in the text were significant at the 0 05 level of probability all analysis was performed using spss 10 0 spss inc chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 environmental and biological factors detailed information on the seasonality of key environmental and biological variables was illustrated in fig 2 the daily mean net solar radiation r n w m 2 varied from 5 1 to 214 1 w m 2 with a mean of 100 6 w m 2 the peaked values were recorded from the end of may to the middle of august the variation of mean daily air temperature t a oc had a similar variation to r n varying from 17 0 to 32 3 c with an average value of about 9 8 c the daily mean vapor press deficit vpd kpa exhibited large variation from 0 1 to 4 1 kpa over a one year period and relative small values 1 kpa were observed when t a is lower than 0 c very few precipitation events were recorded during the study period and the total amount was only 7 6 mm in 2017 on 22 april one flood irrigation event was implemented by the local government the soil moisture θ m3 m 3 at different layers reached their peak values due to the irrigation after that θ in the surface layer 2 cm was relatively low and occasionally varied in response to precipitation interestingly θ only in the middle layers 80 160 cm were observed gradually to decrease during the growing seasons and θ in shallow 20 80 cm and deep 200 cm layers varied slightly the variation of mean daily soil temperature t s oc in layers of 2 and 20 cm had a similar trend to t a and were lower than 0 c during winter seasons t s in deep layers 80 200 cm were above 0 c throughout the whole year periods and varied smoothly the leaf area index lai m2 m 2 showed a clear one peak pattern with relatively high values from middle of june to late august 3 2 water table fluctuations et and specific yield the relationship between diurnal water table fluctuations and et was shown in fig 3 on daily scales the time of decline in water table i e from 8 a m to 6p m corresponded with increase in et similarly a rise in water table in the afternoon was seen when et reduced this suggested that the detected diurnal fluctuations in water table was a result of plant water uptake from the groundwater on seasonal scales the water table also fluctuated and tightly coupled with daily et fig 4 a general upward trend of water level was observed before the start of the growing seasons i e from 1 jan to late april and et was close to zeros in 22 april a sharp rising in water table was observed due to the seepage of the irrigated water by the ewdp after the onset of the growing season the water table declined with the increases in et noticeably the declining rate of water table from the middle of may to the late of july was faster than that in august to september in the late of september the water table began to rise slowly due to the ceases of plant water uptake the wide range of water table fluctuations resulted in a considerable variation in specific yield s y from 0 005 at 0 25 m below land surface to 0 040 at 2 14 m below land surface over a one year period fig 4c it s worth noting that s y remained relatively constant from the late of june to september with a mean value of 0 034 and a standard deviation of 0 001 3 3 comparison of etg estimates by different methods because of the influences of flood irrigation the water table fluctuated complexly from 22 april to the middle of may fig 4b thus the estimated etg by different methods would be unreliable during these periods here we only selected the water table data spanning from the late may to early october to explore the performances of different methods the results indicated that the hays method and the soylu method performed very similarly in the estimations of etg p 0 073 using tukey s method the slope of linear regressions of the estimated etg between the two methods was close to one r 2 0 78 fig 5 a however the white method tended to underestimate etg comparing with the other two methods the linear regression of etg between the souly hays method and the white method has a slope lower than one with low r 2 values fig 5b and 5c one way analysis of variance anova with tukey s hsd post hoc tests also indicated that the performances of the white method were significantly different from that of the hays and soylu methods f 2 446 34 02 p 1 79 10 14 fig 5c the seasonal variations of measured et and estimated etg by different methods were shown in fig 6 it revealed that the underestimations of etg by the white method mainly occurred in the second half of the selected period i e from august to the early of october fig 6a overall the estimated cumulative etg during the selected period by the white method 243 mm was significant lower than that by the hays 389 mm and the soylu 349 mm methods fig 6b the ratio of etg to et etg et during the whole study period were 51 5 46 2 and 32 1 for the hays soylu and white methods respectively interestingly we also found that the etg et ratio varied over different months with a range from 0 30 to 0 97 from 0 25 to 0 88 and from 0 18 to 0 52 for the hays soylu and white methods respectively fig 6b generally the etg et ratios were low 0 30 in may and slightly increased about 0 40 in months from june to august thus soil moisture was the main source for plant water uptake from may to august on the contrary the etg et ratios estimated by different methods were all above 0 50 during the late growing stages i e in september and october indicating that groundwater was the main source for plant water usage 3 4 identification of disagreement agreement between different methods the long term observations in our site provided us an opportunity to evaluate the behaviors of different methods under various water table conditions in field environments fig 7 illustrated the application of these methods for 4 samples of three day groundwater time series during different plant growing stages for the white method δs were mainly determined by the changing trends of water level i e declining raising or stable when water table exhibited a declining trend i e from 8 june to 9 june the estimated δs values were positive fig 7a when water tables became relatively stable i e from 17 august to 19 august δs were close to zeros fig 7b during the late growing stages as water table showed an upward trend i e from 31 september to 2 october the values of δs were negative and may exceed the estimated groundwater recovery rate 24r which resulted in negative et estimates fig 7c overall δs showed a decreasing trend 3 mm day 1 r 2 0 17 during the study period fig 8 b this partly explained the reason of underestimates of etg by the white method in the second half of the selected period in addition the estimates of groundwater recovery rate r is highly depended on the hour to hour variations in water table depth during nighttime period when nighttime water table fluctuated weakly and irregularly the short nighttime interval used by the white method may lead to large uncertainties in r determinations and even unreliable negative r values fig 7d during the selected periods the number of days with negative estimates in r and δs were 12 days 8 1 and 52 days 34 9 respectively fig 8a and 8b the negative values of r and δs would resulted in underestimated and even negative etg values by the white method on the contrary the groundwater recovery rate h 2 l 1 t 2 t 1 which is the second term in eq 2 and changes in water level h 1 l 1 estimated by the hays method were reasonable under various water table conditions fig 7e 7 h the seasonal variations of these parameters properly represented the characteristics of plant et processes with greater values when et was high and reduced rates when et was low fig 8a and 8b for the soylu method the parameter 2b calculated along a multiday i e 1 7 days moving window can well capture the mean amplitude of the diurnal fluctuations over the window sizes fig 7i 7 l thus the soylu method performed robustly under various water table conditions by fully using the diurnal water level fluctuation overall it seems that the hays and soylu methods are more suitable for long term etg estimates in field environments than the commonly used white method 4 discussion the specific yield s y is of crucial importance for estimating etg because its error is translated directly to final estimates white 1932 lautz 2008 martinet et al 2009 fahle and dietrich 2014 fan et al 2016 traditionally sy is defined as the volume of water that an unconfined aquifer releases from storage per unit surface area of aquifer per unit decline in the water table freeze and cherry 1979 and thus is a constant however this definition of s y neglects the store of water held above the water table by capillary forces an increasing number of studies pointed that s y is not a constant and is related to the depth from the surface to the water table childs 1960 bear 1972 duke 1972 nachabe 2002 crosbie et al 2005 loheide ii 2008 fan et al 2014 mould et al 2010 wang pozdniakov 2014 in this study the estimated s y calculated using the method proposed by loheide et al 2005 for silt loam soil were within the ranges of literature estimates for examples johnson 1967 collected data from a wide range of studies and showed that s y for silt loam varied from 0 01 to 0 2 singhal and gupta 1999 reported sy of 0 02 to 0 05 for rocky silt loam furthermore we use a monte carlo mc procedure to find the optimal s y values that would minimize the differences between observed and estimated et see details in supporting information a2 the values of s y estimated using the mc procedure for the hays 0 0319 0 006 and soylu 0 0362 0 003 methods were very similar to that determined using equation 6 i e 0 0338 0 001 fig 8 however relative large s y value were obtained by the mc procedure for the white 0 0495 0 003 fig 9 method this is mainly because δs was underestimated during the periods fig 8b and s y acted as a correction factor to compensate for the underestimations of δs fahle dietrich 2005 thus the method proposed by loheide et al 2005 was suitable to obtain proper s y values for etg estimates in our site up to now the white method have been widely modified with regard to the time period used to calculate r for instances rushton 1996 used a period from 6p m of the previous day to 6 a m to estimate the r values loheide 2008 employed a time period from midnight to 6 a m to derive r miller et al 2010 calculated r using the period from 10p m at night to 7 a m of the next morning and averaging the calculated r values of the previous night and the subsequent night here we investigated the influences of different time period on the estimations of r and etg see table 1 for details in time periods used to calculate r by various modifications and their abbreviations the results showed that r and etg determined by the white rushton method were generally larger than that determined by other methods especially during the second half of the selected periods fig 10 interestingly a good correlation of estimated etg between the white rushton and hays methods were found with a regression slope of 0 98 and r 2 0 63 thus it seemed that the lengthened time period employed by rushton 1996 is more reasonable in determining r in our site than that other methods however it should be noted that unreliable negative etg values were still obtained by the white rushton method as water level raised in addition the three methods investigated in this study assumed that r is constant during the complete one day period however some studies suggested that r is not constant over time and must be estimated as a function of time loheide 2008 gribovszki et al 2008 thus more attentions should be paid to investigate the time dependence of the groundwater recovery rate r in future studies t ramosissima is well known as a phreatophyte with more than 95 of the total absorbing roots distributed below 60 cm of soil surface xu li 2006 wu et al 2014 here we also observed that only deep 80 160 cm soil water contents decreased considerably during the growing seasons fig 2e thus deep soil water and groundwater were the main water sources for the riparian t ramosissima ecosystems at our site interestingly our results indicated that t ramosissima may has substantial plasticity in water uptake sources during the whole growing seasons it mainly used soil water when soil moisture was available and then they used groundwater when soil water was exhausted fig 2e and fig 6 this finding is consistent with the results of previous studies conducted on arid and semi arid plant communities dawson pate 1996 zencich et al 2002 barbeta et al 2015 voltas et al 2015 tiemuerbieke et al 2018 furthermore the estimated etg et by the hayes and soylu methods were comparable with the results using the stable isotopic methods conducted on the same species in northwest china for examples wu et al 2014 reported that the contribution of groundwater to the water use of t ramosissima at the southern edge of the gurbantonggut desert increased from about 33 in spring to 43 100 in summer and autumn zhao et al 2020 showed that the contributions of groundwater to t ramosissima in the lower reaches of heihe river basin increased from 17 2 in wet seasons to 90 in dry seasons finally it is well known that the water table depth has fundamentally impacted on the biological processes of riparian ecosystems in arid and semi arid regions meinzer et al 1926 horton et al 2001 wang et al 2011 rohde et al 2021 as human water demand and land surface temperature increase natural hydrology is greatly altered through surface water diversions into canals for irrigations dams constructed for water storage and extensive groundwater pumping haddeland et al 2014 consequently declines in water table and losses of water access by riparian plants have well documented in arid regions scott et al 1999 cooper et al 2003 rohde et al 2021 thus the long term fate of the riparian ecosystems in arid regions is mainly dependent on proper usages of the limited water resource rohde et al 2021 to protect and restore the ecosystems in the lower reaches of heihe river basin the local government initiated an ewdp in 2000 our studies revealed that the ewdp is important for the survivals of the local ecosystems due to its role in replenishing the soil water content and maintaining the water table level lu et al 2021 also reported that the water table level in most areas has risen and the vegetation has been remarkably restored due to the implements of ewdp in the future more studies on the ecology water economy relationship are needed in arid inland river regions 5 conclusions in this study we systematically evaluated and compared the performances of three etg estimate methods at daily time scale based on water table fluctuations for the white method the selected time intervals could have significantly impacts on the estimations of groundwater recovery rate and etg generally the white method is suitable to be used during the water table declining periods on the contrary the performances of the soylu and hays methods were similar and robust under various water table conditions thus it seems that the hays and soylu methods are more suitable for long term etg estimates in field environments by combining latent heat flux observations from ec we can identify the percentage of plant transpired water from groundwater our results indicated that the riparian forest t ramosissima has substantial plasticity in water uptake sources during the whole growing seasons it mainly used soil water during the early growing stages i e from may to august and it tended to use groundwater during the late growing stages i e from september to the middle of october in the future studies a systematic collection of stable isotope compositions of xylem water soil water and groundwater were needed to assess seasonal patterns of water uptake of the riparian forest

maintaining ecological balance and providing important ecosystem services for people rohde et al 2021 many riparian plant species are phreatophytes and fundamentally depend on groundwater for survival grime 1977 smith et al 1998 eamus et al 2015 mayes et al 2002 naumburg et al 2005 thus accurate estimate of the amount of groundwater consumed by vegetation evapotranspiration etg is critical for fully understanding the interactions between groundwater and vegetation and for the management of regional groundwater resources orellana et al 2012 over the past several decades increased attentions have been given to the use of diurnal water table fluctuations to quantify etg at daily time scale and various methods have been proposed fahle ottfried 2014 in his original work white 1932 first proposed a method of estimating daily etg from diurnal water table fluctuations assuming constant daily groundwater recovery rate at the point of measurement based on the same fundamental assumption some new approaches have been developed to estimate etg at daily time scale for instance dolan et al 1984 proposed to calculate daily etg by using dual extrapolation of the nighttime groundwater recovery rate to noon in his doctoral thesis hays 2003 developed a new daily etg estimation method solely using extrema of the hydrograph soylu et al 2012 proposed a fourier based method to calculate daily etg by taking the full water table fluctuations into account we noticed that the dolan method can be converted to the white method by setting groundwater recovery rate to the mean value of the two nights and found that their performances were generally similar during our study period see supporting information a1 thus in this study we mainly focused on investigating the performances of the three distinct methods i e the white method the hays method and the soylu method in estimating daily etg based on diurnal water table fluctuations due to their simplicity and cost effectiveness these methods have been widely used in estimating daily etg over various ecosystems such as wetland hughes et al 2001 mazur et al 2014 savannah miller et al 2010 forests vincke thiry 2008 fan et al 2016 and riparian ecosystems in arid and semi arid regions yuan et al 2015 yue et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 nevertheless there are still some insufficiencies in systematic inter comparison and analysis of these methods in estimating daily etg first most previous studies mainly focused on evaluating the performances of one specific method at a particular site hughes et al 2001 vincke thiry 2008 miller et al 2010 mazur et al 2014 yuan et al 2015 fan et al 2016 yue et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 to our knowledge a systematic cross comparison of these methods on estimating daily etg has not been conducted in field environments second the performances of these methods in estimating daily etg are expected to differ due to their differences in complexities fahle ottfried 2014 to select the best suitable method for long term daily etg estimation it is needed to test their performances under various water table conditions finally identifying the percentage of plant transpired water from groundwater is crucial for ecological management of arid and semi arid ecosystems ehleringer et al 1998 lanning et al 2020 the isotopic techniques have been widely used in previous studies dawson pate 1996 zencich et al 2002 barbeta et al 2015 voltas et al 2015 tiemuerbieke et al 2018 however researches that comprehensively use water table fluctuations and flux measurements were relatively few with the exception of miller et al 2010 based on one year round observation of water table fluctuations soil moistures and fluxes measurements from the riparian forest in arid northwest china in 2017 the objectives of the present study were to 1 evaluate the performances of three daily etg estimation methods under various water table conditions in field environments 2 analysis the disagreement agreement between different methods and 3 identify the plant water uptake source during the whole growing period 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study site 101 1374oe 42 0012on 873 m

an automated pressure transducer hobo water level logger u20 onset computer corp usa was used to record the groundwater level below the surface at 30 min intervals the leaf area index lai a potential factor influencing plant activities was extracted from mod15a https modis ornl gov at 500 m spatial and 4 day temporal resolutions we used an average of four surrounding pixels around the ec flux tower to acquire the time series of lai during our study period 2 3 methods for estimating etg based on water table fluctuation theoretically the evapotranspiration et mm d 1 at our site could result from four water sources 1 groundwater 2 overflowing flood 3 precipitation and 4 soil water in the root layer therefore the total et over the riparian ecosystem was defined as 1 et et g et f et p et s where etg etf etp and ets all in mm d 1 are the daily evapotranspiration from groundwater flood water precipitation and soil water respectively because of the scarce precipitation in our site etp could be neglected during most of the time on the contrary there was one flood irrigation event at spring i e 22 april 2017 due to the implement of the ecological water diversion project ewdp by the local government during this period the other components of et i e etg etf and ets cannot be neglected however it is generally difficult to preciously calculate them because of the heterogeneities of the hydrological conditions i e ponding excessive percolation and inadequate wetting of the soil may concurrently occur in different areas in the field as the surface became dry et could only result from groundwater and soil water under such conditions ets could be calculated using the soil moisture balance equation see supporting information a2 here we mainly focused on introducing the three main etg estimate methods based on the water table fluctuations 2 3 1 white method in his original work white 1932 proposed a method of estimating daily total etg from groundwater hydrographs using the following equation 2 et g 24 r δ s s y where sy is the specific yield dimensionless of the groundwater bearing material in which the diurnal fluctuations are observed r is the net groundwater recovery inflow rate m h 1 and δs is the net rise or fall of groundwater level during the 24 h period m day 1 and the or in equation are used in the case of water table fall or rise respectively the groundwater recovery rate r is calculated from the slope of the best fit line to the hydrograph between midnight and 4 a m see supporting information a3 this methodology therefore assumes that r is constant throughout the day and that the interval between midnight and 4 00 a m is an appropriate period for estimating r values 2 3 2 hays method in his doctoral thesis hays 2003 proposed a new method for calculation of etg 3 et g h 1 l 1 h 2 l 1 t 2 t 1 s y where h 1 m is the maximum water level of the day under consideration l 1 m is the according minimum groundwater level h 2 m is the maximum of the following day t 2 h is the time span between h 1 and l 1 and t 1 h is the time span between l 1 and h 2 see supporting information a3 in the hays method the groundwater recovery rate is calculated in the subsequent night according to the second term in equation 2 and et is just considered between h 1 and l 1 2 3 3 soylu method soylu et al 2012 proposed a fourier based method to calculate etg by taking he full diurnal cycle into account in particular they applied a sine function with a period of 24 h across a multiday i e 1 7 days moving window of detrended groundwater level by fitting to the following time series function 4 h t a t d b sin 2 π t k 24 where a m h 1 is the multiday trend t h the time in hours d m is the mean bias b m is the diurnal amplitude and k h is the diurnal signal phase see supporting information a3 similar to the hays approach the daily etg is estimated as function of the daily peak to trough range 2b 5 et g s y k 2 b where k is a scaling factor which depends only on the shape and duration of the diurnal et curve it was found that the magnitude of k ranged from 1 6 to 2 2 with a mean of 1 9 soylu et al 2012 here k was set to the mean scaling factor of 1 9 2 4 specific yield estimates the specific yield s y is a critical parameter for the calculation of etg the uncertainty of s y is the major factor that causes the errors in etg estimation healy and cook 2002 in shallow water table environments s y has been found to be effected by soil textures and the depth to the water table see details in supporting information a2 in this study s y was calculated using the method proposed by loheide et al 2005 6 s y θ s θ r θ s θ r 1 α d n m where d m is water table depth θ s and θ r are saturated and residual soil moisture dimensionless α m 1 n dimensionless and m dimensionless are empirical coefficients used in the van genuchten 1980 model noticeably s y that obtained from equation 6 is referred to either as the apparent specific yield or the depth compensated specific yield fan et al 2014 loheide ii et al 2005 to obtain the s y value of the study area soil samples at three depth ranges 0 0 5 m 0 5 1 0 m and 1 0 1 5 m below the ground were collected the soil moisture curve of the soil samples was determined using a pressure plate extractor daiki 3404 daiki rika kogyo co ltd saitama japan to obtain important parameters used in the van genuchten model and the properties of the soil samples were analyzed using a mastersizer 2000 laser diffractometer malvern panalytical malvern uk the parameters for the silt loam soil at our site are estimated as follows θ s 0 38 m3 m 3 θ r 0 16 m3 m 3 α 0 85 m 1 n 1 23 and m 0 19 to verify the reasonability of this method we also use a monte carlo mc procedure to find the optimal s y values that would minimize the differences between observed and estimated total et see details in supporting information a2 2 5 statistical measures of the performances of different methods comparisons between different methods in estimating daily etg were performed by using the coefficient of determination r 2 slope b 0 and intercept b 1 of the linear regression of estimated daily etg between any two methods r 2 describes the degree of co linearity between two models and ranges between 0 and 1 with higher values indicating a good co linearity to determine whether any methods significantly differed from each other we used one way analysis of variance anova with tukey s honest significant difference hsd post hoc test the hsd post hoc test is a step down procedure for testing all possible subset homogeneity hypotheses in pairwise fashion differences referred to in the text were significant at the 0 05 level of probability all analysis was performed using spss 10 0 spss inc chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 environmental and biological factors detailed information on the seasonality of key environmental and biological variables was illustrated in fig 2 the daily mean net solar radiation r n w m 2 varied from 5 1 to 214 1 w m 2 with a mean of 100 6 w m 2 the peaked values were recorded from the end of may to the middle of august the variation of mean daily air temperature t a oc had a similar variation to r n varying from 17 0 to 32 3 c with an average value of about 9 8 c the daily mean vapor press deficit vpd kpa exhibited large variation from 0 1 to 4 1 kpa over a one year period and relative small values 1 kpa were observed when t a is lower than 0 c very few precipitation events were recorded during the study period and the total amount was only 7 6 mm in 2017 on 22 april one flood irrigation event was implemented by the local government the soil moisture θ m3 m 3 at different layers reached their peak values due to the irrigation after that θ in the surface layer 2 cm was relatively low and occasionally varied in response to precipitation interestingly θ only in the middle layers 80 160 cm were observed gradually to decrease during the growing seasons and θ in shallow 20 80 cm and deep 200 cm layers varied slightly the variation of mean daily soil temperature t s oc in layers of 2 and 20 cm had a similar trend to t a and were lower than 0 c during winter seasons t s in deep layers 80 200 cm were above 0 c throughout the whole year periods and varied smoothly the leaf area index lai m2 m 2 showed a clear one peak pattern with relatively high values from middle of june to late august 3 2 water table fluctuations et and specific yield the relationship between diurnal water table fluctuations and et was shown in fig 3 on daily scales the time of decline in water table i e from 8 a m to 6p m corresponded with increase in et similarly a rise in water table in the afternoon was seen when et reduced this suggested that the detected diurnal fluctuations in water table was a result of plant water uptake from the groundwater on seasonal scales the water table also fluctuated and tightly coupled with daily et fig 4 a general upward trend of water level was observed before the start of the growing seasons i e from 1 jan to late april and et was close to zeros in 22 april a sharp rising in water table was observed due to the seepage of the irrigated water by the ewdp after the onset of the growing season the water table declined with the increases in et noticeably the declining rate of water table from the middle of may to the late of july was faster than that in august to september in the late of september the water table began to rise slowly due to the ceases of plant water uptake the wide range of water table fluctuations resulted in a considerable variation in specific yield s y from 0 005 at 0 25 m below land surface to 0 040 at 2 14 m below land surface over a one year period fig 4c it s worth noting that s y remained relatively constant from the late of june to september with a mean value of 0 034 and a standard deviation of 0 001 3 3 comparison of etg estimates by different methods because of the influences of flood irrigation the water table fluctuated complexly from 22 april to the middle of may fig 4b thus the estimated etg by different methods would be unreliable during these periods here we only selected the water table data spanning from the late may to early october to explore the performances of different methods the results indicated that the hays method and the soylu method performed very similarly in the estimations of etg p 0 073 using tukey s method the slope of linear regressions of the estimated etg between the two methods was close to one r 2 0 78 fig 5 a however the white method tended to underestimate etg comparing with the other two methods the linear regression of etg between the souly hays method and the white method has a slope lower than one with low r 2 values fig 5b and 5c one way analysis of variance anova with tukey s hsd post hoc tests also indicated that the performances of the white method were significantly different from that of the hays and soylu methods f 2 446 34 02 p 1 79 10 14 fig 5c the seasonal variations of measured et and estimated etg by different methods were shown in fig 6 it revealed that the underestimations of etg by the white method mainly occurred in the second half of the selected period i e from august to the early of october fig 6a overall the estimated cumulative etg during the selected period by the white method 243 mm was significant lower than that by the hays 389 mm and the soylu 349 mm methods fig 6b the ratio of etg to et etg et during the whole study period were 51 5 46 2 and 32 1 for the hays soylu and white methods respectively interestingly we also found that the etg et ratio varied over different months with a range from 0 30 to 0 97 from 0 25 to 0 88 and from 0 18 to 0 52 for the hays soylu and white methods respectively fig 6b generally the etg et ratios were low 0 30 in may and slightly increased about 0 40 in months from june to august thus soil moisture was the main source for plant water uptake from may to august on the contrary the etg et ratios estimated by different methods were all above 0 50 during the late growing stages i e in september and october indicating that groundwater was the main source for plant water usage 3 4 identification of disagreement agreement between different methods the long term observations in our site provided us an opportunity to evaluate the behaviors of different methods under various water table conditions in field environments fig 7 illustrated the application of these methods for 4 samples of three day groundwater time series during different plant growing stages for the white method δs were mainly determined by the changing trends of water level i e declining raising or stable when water table exhibited a declining trend i e from 8 june to 9 june the estimated δs values were positive fig 7a when water tables became relatively stable i e from 17 august to 19 august δs were close to zeros fig 7b during the late growing stages as water table showed an upward trend i e from 31 september to 2 october the values of δs were negative and may exceed the estimated groundwater recovery rate 24r which resulted in negative et estimates fig 7c overall δs showed a decreasing trend 3 mm day 1 r 2 0 17 during the study period fig 8 b this partly explained the reason of underestimates of etg by the white method in the second half of the selected period in addition the estimates of groundwater recovery rate r is highly depended on the hour to hour variations in water table depth during nighttime period when nighttime water table fluctuated weakly and irregularly the short nighttime interval used by the white method may lead to large uncertainties in r determinations and even unreliable negative r values fig 7d during the selected periods the number of days with negative estimates in r and δs were 12 days 8 1 and 52 days 34 9 respectively fig 8a and 8b the negative values of r and δs would resulted in underestimated and even negative etg values by the white method on the contrary the groundwater recovery rate h 2 l 1 t 2 t 1 which is the second term in eq 2 and changes in water level h 1 l 1 estimated by the hays method were reasonable under various water table conditions fig 7e 7 h the seasonal variations of these parameters properly represented the characteristics of plant et processes with greater values when et was high and reduced rates when et was low fig 8a and 8b for the soylu method the parameter 2b calculated along a multiday i e 1 7 days moving window can well capture the mean amplitude of the diurnal fluctuations over the window sizes fig 7i 7 l thus the soylu method performed robustly under various water table conditions by fully using the diurnal water level fluctuation overall it seems that the hays and soylu methods are more suitable for long term etg estimates in field environments than the commonly used white method 4 discussion the specific yield s y is of crucial importance for estimating etg because its error is translated directly to final estimates white 1932 lautz 2008 martinet et al 2009 fahle and dietrich 2014 fan et al 2016 traditionally sy is defined as the volume of water that an unconfined aquifer releases from storage per unit surface area of aquifer per unit decline in the water table freeze and cherry 1979 and thus is a constant however this definition of s y neglects the store of water held above the water table by capillary forces an increasing number of studies pointed that s y is not a constant and is related to the depth from the surface to the water table childs 1960 bear 1972 duke 1972 nachabe 2002 crosbie et al 2005 loheide ii 2008 fan et al 2014 mould et al 2010 wang pozdniakov 2014 in this study the estimated s y calculated using the method proposed by loheide et al 2005 for silt loam soil were within the ranges of literature estimates for examples johnson 1967 collected data from a wide range of studies and showed that s y for silt loam varied from 0 01 to 0 2 singhal and gupta 1999 reported sy of 0 02 to 0 05 for rocky silt loam furthermore we use a monte carlo mc procedure to find the optimal s y values that would minimize the differences between observed and estimated et see details in supporting information a2 the values of s y estimated using the mc procedure for the hays 0 0319 0 006 and soylu 0 0362 0 003 methods were very similar to that determined using equation 6 i e 0 0338 0 001 fig 8 however relative large s y value were obtained by the mc procedure for the white 0 0495 0 003 fig 9 method this is mainly because δs was underestimated during the periods fig 8b and s y acted as a correction factor to compensate for the underestimations of δs fahle dietrich 2005 thus the method proposed by loheide et al 2005 was suitable to obtain proper s y values for etg estimates in our site up to now the white method have been widely modified with regard to the time period used to calculate r for instances rushton 1996 used a period from 6p m of the previous day to 6 a m to estimate the r values loheide 2008 employed a time period from midnight to 6 a m to derive r miller et al 2010 calculated r using the period from 10p m at night to 7 a m of the next morning and averaging the calculated r values of the previous night and the subsequent night here we investigated the influences of different time period on the estimations of r and etg see table 1 for details in time periods used to calculate r by various modifications and their abbreviations the results showed that r and etg determined by the white rushton method were generally larger than that determined by other methods especially during the second half of the selected periods fig 10 interestingly a good correlation of estimated etg between the white rushton and hays methods were found with a regression slope of 0 98 and r 2 0 63 thus it seemed that the lengthened time period employed by rushton 1996 is more reasonable in determining r in our site than that other methods however it should be noted that unreliable negative etg values were still obtained by the white rushton method as water level raised in addition the three methods investigated in this study assumed that r is constant during the complete one day period however some studies suggested that r is not constant over time and must be estimated as a function of time loheide 2008 gribovszki et al 2008 thus more attentions should be paid to investigate the time dependence of the groundwater recovery rate r in future studies t ramosissima is well known as a phreatophyte with more than 95 of the total absorbing roots distributed below 60 cm of soil surface xu li 2006 wu et al 2014 here we also observed that only deep 80 160 cm soil water contents decreased considerably during the growing seasons fig 2e thus deep soil water and groundwater were the main water sources for the riparian t ramosissima ecosystems at our site interestingly our results indicated that t ramosissima may has substantial plasticity in water uptake sources during the whole growing seasons it mainly used soil water when soil moisture was available and then they used groundwater when soil water was exhausted fig 2e and fig 6 this finding is consistent with the results of previous studies conducted on arid and semi arid plant communities dawson pate 1996 zencich et al 2002 barbeta et al 2015 voltas et al 2015 tiemuerbieke et al 2018 furthermore the estimated etg et by the hayes and soylu methods were comparable with the results using the stable isotopic methods conducted on the same species in northwest china for examples wu et al 2014 reported that the contribution of groundwater to the water use of t ramosissima at the southern edge of the gurbantonggut desert increased from about 33 in spring to 43 100 in summer and autumn zhao et al 2020 showed that the contributions of groundwater to t ramosissima in the lower reaches of heihe river basin increased from 17 2 in wet seasons to 90 in dry seasons finally it is well known that the water table depth has fundamentally impacted on the biological processes of riparian ecosystems in arid and semi arid regions meinzer et al 1926 horton et al 2001 wang et al 2011 rohde et al 2021 as human water demand and land surface temperature increase natural hydrology is greatly altered through surface water diversions into canals for irrigations dams constructed for water storage and extensive groundwater pumping haddeland et al 2014 consequently declines in water table and losses of water access by riparian plants have well documented in arid regions scott et al 1999 cooper et al 2003 rohde et al 2021 thus the long term fate of the riparian ecosystems in arid regions is mainly dependent on proper usages of the limited water resource rohde et al 2021 to protect and restore the ecosystems in the lower reaches of heihe river basin the local government initiated an ewdp in 2000 our studies revealed that the ewdp is important for the survivals of the local ecosystems due to its role in replenishing the soil water content and maintaining the water table level lu et al 2021 also reported that the water table level in most areas has risen and the vegetation has been remarkably restored due to the implements of ewdp in the future more studies on the ecology water economy relationship are needed in arid inland river regions 5 conclusions in this study we systematically evaluated and compared the performances of three etg estimate methods at daily time scale based on water table fluctuations for the white method the selected time intervals could have significantly impacts on the estimations of groundwater recovery rate and etg generally the white method is suitable to be used during the water table declining periods on the contrary the performances of the soylu and hays methods were similar and robust under various water table conditions thus it seems that the hays and soylu methods are more suitable for long term etg estimates in field environments by combining latent heat flux observations from ec we can identify the percentage of plant transpired water from groundwater our results indicated that the riparian forest t ramosissima has substantial plasticity in water uptake sources during the whole growing seasons it mainly used soil water during the early growing stages i e from may to august and it tended to use groundwater during the late growing stages i e from september to the middle of october in the future studies a systematic collection of stable isotope compositions of xylem water soil water and groundwater were needed to assess seasonal patterns of water uptake of the riparian forest

3541,water security plays an important role in socio economic development ecosystem management and environmental sustainability over the last four decades water security assessment has attracted much political and economic attention an improved understanding of the relationships between water demand and supply is needed to mitigate the impacts of diminishing water resources this study provides an overview of water security assessment by focusing on the various water security indicators and the concept of water footprint blue green and grey water the water security indicators based on the water footprint concept is currently receiving more attention because it accounts for the return flow from the total water withdrawn from a watershed we also investigate the application of different physically based hydrological models such as soil and water assessment tool swat and variable infiltration capacity vic on water security assessment at a regional to continental scale however hydrological agricultural system models cannot quantify evapotranspiration from irrigation and rainwater separately therefore independent quantification of blue and green water footprint from an irrigated field is challenging for illustration purposes we apply the fully distributed agricultural ecosystems services ages model in the big dry creek watershed bdcw an intensively managed and irrigated watershed located in semiarid colorado the results indicate that the blue water footprint is higher than the green water footprint in the watershed in addition the spatial distribution of grey water footprint is highly correlated with the amount of fertilizer application the variation of grey water footprint among the irrigated fields is higher than blue and green water footprints we conclude that applying a physically distributed model can provide useful insight into the impact of climate and anthropogenic activities on water security at different scales keywords water security indicators water footprint physically distributed models swat ages 1 introduction the shortage of freshwater resources is a daunting reality and the current manifestation is that two thirds of the global population lives under severe water scarcity at least one month of a year mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 he et al 2021 stenzel et al 2021 in addition the global risk report world economic forum 2015 identified that the crisis due to water scarcity has the highest impact in the current global situation meanwhile it is anticipated that by 2050 the global population will increase up to 32 and the corresponding food demand will increase up to 60 boretti and rosa 2019 therefore since the late 1980s water scarcity research has been identified as one of the key elements for formulating policies at global and regional scales liu et al 2017a b the linkage of freshwater shortage with rapidly growing population associated with increasing demand in different water sectors such as agriculture domestic and municipal water usage sectors are well documented veettil and mishra 2016 2020 2018 wada et al 2017 2011 kummu et al 2010 oki and kanae 2006a b vörösmarty et al 2000 the changing pattern of land use and climate variables stresses the hydrologic cycle thereby affecting local and regional water security veettil and mishra 2018 2020 ipcc 2014 2021 however quantifying the effect of climate change on water security is challenging due to the uncertainties associated with climate model projections particularly for the pattern and magnitude of precipitation schewe et al 2014 in addition the intensity and characteristics of water scarcity impact due to climate change can vary substantially from region to region and the magnitude of scarcity is coupled with population growth expansion of agriculture and industrialization abbaspour et al 2009 haddeland et al 2014 moreover it is surprisingly challenging to assess whether the water scarcity in a region is related to supply i e available water or lack of better water demand management among different sectors water security depicts the acceptable level of water related risk of a water resource while satisfying the need for livelihood human well being economic and ecosystem functioning un 2013 rodrigues et al 2014 grey and sadoff 2007 water security of a region is addressed by the concepts of water stress shortage and scarcity related to the accessibility of population to the freshwater resources veettil and mishra 2018 2020 here water scarcity depicts the long term water imbalance between demand and supply eu 2007 formulating water management policies at global regional national and local scales may obfuscate the scenarios of water scarcity and drought pereira et al 2002 therefore understanding the fundamental difference between water scarcity and drought is crucial a comprehensive overview of drought including drought classification propagation and drought indices from a user perspective is provided in mishra and singh 2010 recently physically distributed hydrological modeling has been widely used to comprehensively evaluate water security at different spatiotemporal scales veettil and mishra 2018 2020 florke et al 2018 wada et al 2017 2014 hydrological models such as swat soil and water assessment tool arnold et al 1998 srinivasan et al 1998 and vic variable infiltration capacity liang et al 1994 wood et al 1997 can be used to predict and design sustainable water management policies concerning the changing climate land use and growing population ma et al 2020 in this study we applied a fully distributed model called the agricultural ecosystems services ages model green et al 2014 2015 ascough et al 2015 to an intensively managed suburban and agricultural watershed located in the semiarid region to quantify different water security indicators the specific objectives of this study are 1 to provide an overview of water security assessment by focusing on various water security indicators and the concept of blue green and grey water footprints 2 to review the existing hydrological and agricultural system models which can be applied to quantifying water security indicators 3 to illustrate the water security assessment based on blue green and grey water footprint by applying a fully distributed agricultural ecosystems service ages model in an intensively managed and highly irrigated watershed in the semiarid colorado state the manuscript is organized as follows section 1 1 discusses the concept and need for water security assessment section 1 2 discusses the water security indicators section 2 discusses the water footprint wf concept section 3 discusses the sectoral application of water footprint concepts section 4 explains the quantification of green and blue water scarcity section 5 discusses the role of various hydrological models in water security assessment the application of ages and major findings are discussed in subsequent sections 1 1 concept and need for water security assessment in the past the use of the term water security has increased across a wide range of disciplines cook and bakker 2012 the world economic forum wef and unesco s institute for water education prioritized water security as a significant global risk linking the web of food energy climate and economic growth challenges mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 liu et al 2017a b vörösmarty et al 2021 in addition to rapid population growth diets in society are shifting toward more livestock based products schyns et al 2019 2015 molden 2007 and the water footprints related to such products are substantial erb et al 2009 odegard and van der voet 2014 the sustainable development goals sdgs aim to develop across multiple sectors such as clean energy zero hunger no poverty and clean water and sanitation water security is essential to meet most sdgs by 2030 unesco 2019 however recent studies indicate that water security s importance has been highly underestimated vörösmarty et al 2018 therefore sdgs context requires significant worldwide involvement to redirect the current downward trajectory in water security goals in addition the climate projections based analysis suggests less reliable freshwater in the 21st century than in the 20th century with observations that wet regions become wetter and dry regions become drier kumar et al 2014 leading to increasingly vulnerable water security in dry regions in addition the policies for energy production from biomass create stress on water resources hejazi et al 2014 according to stenzel et al 2021 the additional water withdrawal for bioenergy crop irrigation may create more water stress the population living under severe water stress would double compared to today because of the additional water withdrawal and even exceed the impact of climate change therefore future water availability and use studies need to include the possibility of new high demands for water from a growing bioenergy sector the excessive loading of pollutants into water bodies is another important factor that threatens water security van vliet et al 2017 mishra et al 2021 urbanization untreated water from industries and households and nonpoint sources of pollution from agricultural fields contribute toward water quality deterioration mostly in developing countries as a result water scarcity is considerably changed in many regions van vliet et al 2017 mishra et al 2021 however most analyses of global water security are focused on the water quantity aspects whereas the water usage in each sector depends on water quality for example salinity and nutrients are major concerns in irrigated agriculture and water temperature is important in the thermoelectric power sector therefore it is crucial to consider both water quantity and quality while performing water scarcity analyses monitoring water quality in stream channels and addressing its impact on water security is still a major issue evaluation of grey water indices for nutrient discharge zones can indicate the degree of water quality degradation of a stream aldaya et al 2020 liu et al 2017a b wu et al 2012 therefore expanding water monitoring gauges in the global river network is essential to achieving this goal mishra and coulibaly 2010 however water quality models are being developed to provide relevant water quality information particularly in data scarce regions unep 2016 harmel et al 2006 the impact of climate change on water security is a fundamental concern he et al 2021 dolan et al 2021 that causes more extreme floods and droughts globally konapala et al 2020 the water management practices in many regions are not adequately designed to handle the impacts of climate change on the reliability of water supply flood and drought risk agriculture energy and ecosystems moreover the land area subject to severe water scarcity is likely to be more than double that in the present trnka et al 2019 and a rigorous regional prediction of water supply trends is substantially more complicated than analyzing the global picture water scarcity may lead to devastating consequences such as eradicating aquatic systems extinction of species water borne diseases and growing regional and international risks of conflicts related to water sharing di baldassarre et al 2019 gleick 1998 therefore regional and global planning of water allocation in different sectors are necessary to address the following concerns i the amount percentage of water that can be used by a population from a particular water resource ii criteria for farmers to access a water resource iii the amount of water required to maintain the environmental flow with acceptable quality and iv the percentage of water we should leave for future use however long term water planning and technological investments e g massive infrastructure are critical for sustainable and improved water security gleick 2003 vörösmarty et al 2010 although natural and artificial reservoirs structures help increase regional renewable freshwater resources maintaining an environmental flow is vital for ecological health oki and kanae 2006a b vanham et al 2018 based on monthly water scarcity analysis hoekstra et al 2012 observed that most river basins worldwide are going through low moderate or significant water scarcity for at least one month of a given year therefore water security assessment by considering water availability supply and demand is necessary for stakeholders to develop appropriate policies for improving water management in a changing environment 1 2 water security indicators since the 1980s many water security indicators have been developed to evaluate the status of freshwater accessibility liu et al 2017a b srinivasan et al 2017 pedro monzonís et al 2015 brown and matlock 2011 rijsberman 2006 seckler et al 1999 falkenmark 1989 these indicators may also explain and mitigate long term water supply challenges socioeconomic status and environmental risks also these indices are primary measurement tools for assessing the water scarcity of a region or a sector e g economic social or ecological table 1 presents the most widely employed water security indices among more than 150 indices identified damkjaer and taylor 2017 typically a water security indicator is quantified based on water availability consumption population water usage in different sectors and environmental flow requirement efr water security indicators which received significant global attention were derived during the late 1980s nouri et al 2019 liu et al 2017a b have been used to analyze population driven water stress on the global freshwater resources srinivasan et al 2017 falkenmark 2013 for instance the falkenmark index flk falkenmark 1989 the fraction of total runoff streamflow available for human use evaluates the volume of freshwater per capita share m3 person year is the most widely employed water security indicator for representing differences in water availability between countries karabulut et al 2016 damkjaer and taylor 2017 pedro monzonís et al 2015 brown and matlock 2011 based on the per capita water usage the falkenmark index of a region is categorized as no stress flk 1700 m3 person year stress scarcity or absolute scarcity flk 500 m3 person year this index clearly distinguishes between climate and human induced water scarcity vörösmarty et al 2005 however flk omits major variations in water demand among countries due to culture lifestyle and climate rijsberman 2006 also the index does not reflect the transparent spatial distribution of domestic industrial and agricultural water demand distinctly schewe et al 2014 ohisson 2000 modified flk by incorporating the influence of industrial economic or other sectors on water demand and formulated the social water stress index swsi the ratio of water use to availability is a widely accepted water scarcity indicator which addresses the volume of water used and connects it to the available freshwater resources alcamo and henrichs 2002 liu et al 2017a b here water use refers to the total volume of water withdrawal by different sectors consumptive use and the available water can be an actual runoff or actual runoff minus efr environmental flow requirement the measurements focused on the withdrawals ignore the return flows after consumptive use and thus do not provide a comprehensive picture of water scarcity over a watershed veettil and mishra 2016 for instance in most thermoelectric power plants less than three to five percent of water withdrawn is consumed through evaporation whereas 85 of total water use is considered consumption in the irrigation sector therefore in water security assessment we need to consider the consumptive water use net water abstraction rather than water withdrawal because return flows can often be reused and thus do not necessarily contribute to water scarcity researchers have developed many physically based models that address spatiotemporal changes in sectoral water demand and availability since the early 2000s water security analysis based on the water footprint concept hoekstra et al 2011 that includes blue green and grey water footprints are considered appropriate for addressing water security at regional to global scale 2 the water footprint concept the water footprint wf concept developed by hoekstra 2003 was initiated to develop a suitable indicator to evaluate increasing human consumption of freshwater resources and to address the rising opportunity cost of freshwater use in different sectors chenoweth et al 2014 wf is a multidimensional indicator capable of calculating water consumption for i a person ii growing populations iii a process iv a product v a river basin or vi a nation the wf is classified into blue green and grey water fig 1 additionally quantifying consumptive water use will provide a more accurate assessment of the amount of water required for production and better determine the water security hotspot marston et al 2018 konar and marston 2020 a comprehensive explanation of the wf concept and classification is provided in the following sections 2 1 blue and green water footprint precipitation falling on a landscape is partitioned into different components such as evapotranspiration soil moisture and runoff traditional water resources planning and management focus on the efficiency and economics of water storage and diversion of runoff hoekstra 2019a b but this approach fails to efficiently allocate the evaporative component hoekstra 2019a b schyns et al 2019 addressing water security issues and identifying source areas by classifying freshwater resources based on color is an appropriate method for proper water management chenoweth et al 2014 schneider 2013 in addition this concept links the depletion of water resources and increasing population needs here blue water refers to the total volume of surface and subsurface water stored in lakes aquifers and manmade structures and accessible for human consumption falkenmark and rockström 2010 rockström et al 2009 rodrigues et al 2014 hoekstra et al 2011 blue water footprint wfb is the consumptive water use from blue water resources that can be calculated as the volume of surface groundwater consumed for the production of goods e g power production irrigation or service e g domestic water use public water use more systematically the wfb in a watershed is the difference between water withdrawal abstraction and returned flow hoekstra et al 2011 chapagain and tickner 2012 broadly green water is defined as the soil water stored in the vadose zone and vegetation canopy derived from the precipitation and available to the plant roots and soil biota rockström et al 2009 rost et al 2008 veettil and mishra 2016 2020 green water footprint wfg indicates the volume of rainwater consumed during the production process and is relevant for agricultural and forestry products hoekstra 2019a b hoekstra et al 2011 roughly in a continental scale 65 of precipitation produces green water and the remaining 35 forms blue water falkenmark and rockström 2010 and it is evident that 67 of the global crop system still comes from rainfed agriculture portmann et al 2010 where the water consumption purely depends on green water moreover 80 of the global green water footprint is associated with global agricultural production liu et al 2009 which incorporates animal products food crops and bioenergy crops mekonnen and hoekstra 2012a b 2011 however the importance of distinctly quantifying the blue and green water footprints requires further research to use them precisely and explicitly hoekstra 2019a b mekonnen and hoekstra 2020 falkenmark and rockstrum 2006 differentiated green water into two components i green water storage which refers to the total moisture in the soil ii green water flow which indicates the actual evaporation non productive part and actual transpiration productive part link et al 2021 veettil and mishra 2016 a few research considers this productive part as green water flux rost et al 2008 further the concept is indistinct whether it represents evapotranspiration et only from rainwater stored in the soil or includes irrigation or other blue water sources hoekstra 2019a b in addition the blue and green water terms are used to define water use instead of total water resource availability e g chenoweth et al 2014 therefore all these obscurities may result in avoiding the usage or application of the blue and green water concept in the hydrological communities hoekstra 2019a b 2 2 grey water footprint grey water footprint wfy indicates the potential water quality impairment caused by the production of good or service and it is defined as the amount of dilution water freshwater required to assimilate the concentration of nutrients chemicals to approximate the natural original concentration of a given stream aldaya et al 2020 hoekstra et al 2012 wu et al 2012 2021 in general the water quality assessment for a river basin is performed based on the flow of nutrients pollutants released from agricultural fields nitrogen phosphorus potassium and lime as well as the effluent flow from wastewater treatment facilities yan et al 2021 humbird et al 2011 here wfy serves as an index for investigating the water quality standard of available water in that river basin this index is calculated as the ratio of nutrient load to the allowable nutrient load in the region for instance in the case of nitrate no3 load 1 wf y l n o 3 n o 3 max c n o 3 where lno3 is the nitrate loading in mass time in water bodies as a result of nitrogen inputs e g fertilizer application wwtp inflow no3max is the maximum allowable nitrate concentration in ambient water quality standards the value set by the epa is 0 01 kg m3 for human consumption cno3 is the natural nitrate concentration in the stream network nitrate is identified as the largest component in grey water because its loading far exceeds other nutrients in general wu et al 2012 2021 aldaya et al 2020 however the scientific validity of wfy concept has been criticized for instance gawel and bernsen 2011 stated that grey water is fictional or a theoretical concept that does not reflect the opportunity cost associated with production and consumptive use in addition accurate measurement of the background pollutant concentration of streams is challenging the allowable concentration value is not formulated for most nutrients and regions chenoweth et al 2014 moreover the blue and green water footprint illustrates the pressure on water resources while grey water is an environmental impact indicator 3 sectoral application of water footprint concept the application of the wf concept is rapidly increasing in most sectors e g food production energy projects and industry these analyses are performed on a regional or river basin scale to a continental or global scale a wf assessment aims to evaluate how human actions contribute to blue and green water scarcity and pollution grey water issues the assessment helps quantify the impact of wf on the environmental social and economic sectors and frame a strategy for solving the pressure on water resources according to the food and agricultural organization the wf concept can produce beneficial means of evaluating virtual water flow through the trade of food and other commodities dalin et al 2019 hoekstra 2019a and of generating public awareness on global water usage and related water scarcity in this section we provide an overview of the application of wf concept in different sectors such as food production biofuel production and some other sectors including industry mining and energy production 3 1 food production sector the water footprint of major food crops has been analyzed to provide a clear picture of freshwater consumption during the production process hoekstra 2017 lovarelli et al 2016 for example mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 quantified global crop production s green blue and grey wf using the cropwat model globally the total volume of wf estimated for 126 crops was 7404 billion cubic meters per year with 78 green 12 blue and 10 grey wf for example wf for wheat was 1827 m3 ton wfg of 1277 m3 ton a wfb of 342 m3 ton and a wfy of 207 m3 ton in addition the wf of major crops e g rice varies significantly from region to region chapagain and hoekstra 2011 zhuo et al 2016 significant rice production is observed in south asian countries where cultivation is mainly carried out in the wet season therefore the contribution of blue water scarcity is negligible in those areas the water footprint of animal products is relatively higher than the crop products with equivalent nutritional value mekonnen and hoekstra 2012a b hoekstra 2017 for example beef s average wf per calorie is 20 times larger than cereals and starchy roots and wf per gram of protein for milk eggs and chicken meat is 1 5 times larger than for pulses in general industrial livestock products consume and pollute more blue water resources than the products from grazing systems global animal production requires about 2 422 gm3 of water per year of which 87 2 is wfg 6 2 is wfb and 6 6 is wfy mekonnen and hoekstra 2012a b therefore the rising global meat consumption and the intensification of animal production systems will further pressure the global freshwater resources in the impending decades zhuo et al 2016 the wf analysis for various food crops and animal products is provided in table 2 a 3 2 biofuel energy production sector anthropogenic greenhouse gas ghg emission has been the most significant contributor to climate change since the mid 20th century and the majority is from the energy and transportation sectors scown et al 2011 mbow et al 2017 many researchers have found the use of biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel will strongly support the reduction of ghg emissions mahbub et al 2019 kongboon and sampattagul 2012 for example the us department of energy aims to provide 16 of electricity through biofuel production by 2030 gerbens leenes et al 2012 the european council is encouraging the use of biofuels to increase by 50 by the next decade therefore assessing the wf and related water security analysis due to the biofuel production is necessary for understanding the pressure on water resources schyns et al 2019 mathioudakis et al 2017 dalla marta et al 2012 the biofuel wf varies from crop to crop and region to region depending on the climate topography type of crop and crop yield huang et al 2021 dalla marta et al 2012 for example biodiesel generally produced from coconut groundnut and cotton has a relatively high wf gerbens leenes et al 2008 in addition the wfs of sugar cane and cassava vary considerably with respect to the region climate and production systems on average the wf of sugarcane is less than that of cassava kongboon and sampattagul 2012 mathioudakis et al 2017 estimated the wf of ten crop residue types and a few bioenergy feedstocks such as miscanthus eucalyptus and pine and revealed that crop residues have a smaller wf than miscanthus and wood the higher energy use combined with an increasing contribution of energy from biomass will cause competition of water consumption with food production the application of wf concept in various bioenergy crops is listed in table 2b a comprehensive wf assessment of humanity is only possible through comparative analysis of all water usage sectors related to human water use table 2c illustrates the application of the water footprint concept in important sectors such as electricity production and mining 4 green and blue water scarcity high resolution indices are essential for addressing water security at a reliable level quantifying water scarcity as a ratio of water consumed water footprint to water available is a globally accepted metric wada et al 2011 rodrigues et al 2014 that can identify the geographic hotspot for water stress regions according to schyns et al 2019 green water scarcity gw scarcity indicates the competition for limited green water flow which is involved in the production of biomass that adds to the economy the gw scarcity can be quantified as the ratio of wfg to green water storage for example gw scarcity from a field x and period t is calculated as 2 g w s c a r c i t y x t greenwaterfootprint x t greenwaterstorage x t here the green water footprint accounts for the consumptive use of vegetation only from precipitation i e not considering the irrigation water although green water availability is limited and there are competing demands in crop production livestock grazing lands and forest ecosystems gw scarcity has not attracted much attention in water security assessment schyns et al 2019 link et al 2021 vörösmarty et al 2010 wada et al 2011 the evaluation of gw scarcity assists in addressing a nation s capability to produce enough food bioenergy and forestry products with limited blue water availability therefore like blue water scarcity bw scarcity it is critical to consider the gw scarcity and evaluate it through improved modeling approaches environmental flow requirement efr excessive utilization of blue water from a stream may damage the ecosystem health therefore application of the efr concept is mandatory for maintaining a healthy river ecosystem honrado et al 2013 hirji and davis 2009 defined the efr as a standard which maintains the functions processes and resilience of aquatic ecosystems with a minimum quality quantity and timing of water flow therefore efr has a significant role in quantifying the accurate level of blue water scarcity of a region although different methodologies e g low streamflow method adapted smakhtin methodology are developed to evaluate efr the presumptive standard method developed by richter 2010 richter et al 2012 is widely used liang et al 2021 veettil and mishra 2018 zeng et al 2012 according to the presumptive standard method water withdrawal from streamflow greater than 20 will cause degradation in ecosystem health and this available water for withdrawal is termed blue water availability veettil and mishra 2016 considering the role of blue water scarcity the united nations has identified efr as one of the sustainable development goals sdgs particularly sdg indicator 6 4 2 vanham et al 2018 efr supports a wide range of ecosystems such as fish stocks and other aquatic life which provide nutrition biomass directly to people sdg 2 zero hunger like green water scarcity bw scarcity is defined as the ratio of blue water footprint wfb to blue water availability and it highlights mismatches between water availability and water demand hoekstra et al 2011 in general bw scarcity is represented in percentage where bw scarcity 100 refers to the situation where blue water availability is fully consumed for a river basin x and period t 3 b w s c a r c i t y x t blue w a t e r f o o t p r i n t x t blue w a t e r a v a i l a b i l i t y x t 4 blue w a t e r a v a i l a b i l i t y x t t r w r e f r here the total renewable water resource trwr is the total streamflow available quantifying bw scarcity is essential for food security ecological health and economic and business prospects nouri et al 2019 rosa et al 2020 the bw scarcity of a region can be classified into four levels hoekstra et al 2012 i low blue water scarcity bw scarcity 100 where the wfb does not exceed the blue water availability and the efr is satisfied at this level ii moderate blue water scarcity bw scarcity ranges from 100 to 150 here the wfb is between 20 and 30 of natural runoff and the efr criteria are not satisfied in moderate bluewater scarcity iii significant blue water scarcity bw scarcity ranges from 150 to 200 here the wfb is between 30 and 40 of natural runoff the efr is not satisfied iv severe blue water scarcity bw scarcity 200 the monthly wfb exceeds 40 of natural runoff and the concept of efr is drastically unsatisfactory in the regions with severe blue water scarcity various studies have assessed the spatiotemporal fluxes in bw scarcity from a regional to global scale for instance mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 evaluated the global bw scarcity at a high spatial resolution i e grid cells of 30 30 arc min on a monthly basis the result shows that two thirds of the global population lives under severe water scarcity at least one month each year and the most severe hot spots identified were india and china the study also states that a previous study performed on a river basin scale hoekstra et al 2012 underestimated bw scarcity thereby increasing the number of people facing water scarcity threats water scarcity assessments on an annual basis hide the variability within a year and underestimate the areal extend of severity wada et al 2011 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 however the availability of seasonal or monthly scale actual water use data constrains the monthly seasonal scale analysis of bw scarcity excluding efr is another concern in bw scarcity assessment for example wada et al 2011 studied global water scarcity at a high spatial resolution on a monthly basis without accounting for efr and underestimated the number of people facing water scarcity mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 certain studies quantified water scarcity by considering the actual runoff and water withdrawal that will lead to the addition of uncertainty in water scarcity levels kummu et al 2014 oki and kanae 2006a b the choice of scale is a critical element that affects the outcome drawn from water scarcity analyses brunner et al 2019 water scarcity may be over or underestimated when the scale changes from local to continental scale 5 application of hydrological models for water security assessment several modeling approaches have been proposed to quantify water security on a global to local scale wada et al 2011 rodrigues et al 2014 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 veettil and mishra 2016 2020 ma et al 2020 this section reviews the different hydrological and agricultural systems modeling frameworks applied to quantify blue green grey water footprint water availability and related scarcity although a wide variety of hydrological models are available for simulating the historical and future water availability selecting a particular model is challenging because of model prediction uncertainty associated with input variables e g land use and climate model parameter calibration and scale issues in watershed modeling surfleet et al 2012 wada et al 2017 however process based spatially distributed models are capable of evaluating the hydrological or nutrient fluxes in a watershed veettil et al 2021 at various scales in addition these models can simulate streamflow and nutrient loads at interior ungauged sub catchments several studies have applied physically distributed modeling systems to quantify the water footprint water availability and related water scarcity implementation of a hydrological modeling framework to quantify blue and green water footprints availabilities and scarcities based on the simulated hydrologic and nutrient fluxes is illustrated in fig 2 the basic spatial and temporal datasets to simulate these variables include digital elevation models dem which provide the topography and hydrography of the region land use maps soil information daily weather inputs and crop management information generally streamflow and water quality data are needed for model calibration and evaluation the application of modeling frameworks such as swat vic and ages for water security assessment is explained in further sections 5 1 soil and water assessment tool swat swat is a physically based continuous time semi distributed model developed by the united states department of agriculture usda arnold et al 1998 which has been widely used for simulating the water quantity and quality for a small scale watershed cibin et al 2012 large river basins veettil and mishra 2016 to continental scales abbaspour et al 2015 recently the model has been applied for water security assessment at a regional scale rodrigues et al 2014 applied swat to estimate the blue green water availability and related water scarcity over an agricultural basin in brazil subsequently veettil and mishra 2016 2018 used swat to quantify the blue and green water scarcity across the counties located in the savannah river basin a transboundary river basin located in the semi humid eastern us the water balance components in swat are associated with blue or green water and the blue water is estimated by combining the water yield and groundwater storage rodrigues et al 2014 veettil and mishra 2016 2018 here water yield refers to the return flow from each hru hydrologic response unit the smallest spatial unit contributing to streamflow the groundwater storage is the difference between the total recharge to the deep aquifer and the shallow aquifer contributing to streamflow green water storage is the soil water content available for plant consumption and the green water footprint is the evapotranspiration veettil and mishra 2016 applied swat to quantify the blue and green water availability and green water footprint over the savannah river basin here blue water footprint is calculated from the usgs water withdrawal data the result provided an overview of the spatiotemporal changes in county level water security due to sectoral water demand and shortage of supply in the savannah river basin the potential influence of climate and land use variables on blue and green water and related water scarcity was also analyzed for the savannah river basin using swat veettil and mishra 2018 swat has also been applied to quantify the blue and green water availability of arid regions for instance abbaspour et al 2009 assessed the impact of climate change on iran s blue and green water resources in addition schuol et al 2008 used swat to quantify the water availability of african river basins the information from these models is important because most of the subbasins in those regions are ungauged and the data on reservoir management land use management and agricultural practices are limited swat was also used to evaluate the regional grey water footprint wfy for instance wu et al 2012 quantified the wfy due to the biofuel production for the counties located in iowa and girolamo et al 2019 estimated the wfy and its uncertainty for crop production in a basin located in italy using swat 5 2 variable infiltration capacity vic vic is a macroscale hydrological model liang et al 1994 liang and xie 2003 developed to simulate land atmospheric fluxes water and energy balances at independent grid cells the model routes water as surface and baseflow to the stream network veettil and mishra 2020 used the vic output to quantify blue and green water scarcity across the conus here vic version 4 0 3 output was obtained from the giovanni database which provides the modeled outputs of the north american land data assimilation system nldas rui and mocko 2013 the model output is available at a 1 80 grid scale in near real time across the conus here the blue water is quantified by combining the surface runoff and base flow to the stream network and soil water in the top one meter soil depth simulated by vic is considered the green water storage available for plant consumption in addition the analysis of gw scarcity in this study was more realistic by incorporating the rainfed agricultural parcels that avoid blue water resources irrigation the results drawn from this study indicate that water security will remain a challenge particularly in the western usa due to the compounding impacts of changing climate variables and the growing population ma et al 2020 also utilized the vic model to report the water scarcity across china which explicitly investigated water quality requirements for human use 6 application of agricultural ecosystems services ages model for blue green and grey water security assessment unlike swat and vic ages is a fully distributed watershed model capable of routing water and nutrients among the hrus smallest units inside a catchment and stream units ages is a relatively new model and the current version is continuous in time at a daily time step ascough et al 2012 green et al 2014 2015 the hydrological processes in ages were initially adapted from the j2000 krause et al 2006 and j2000 sn fink et al 2007 models the current version 0 3 0 of ages simulates surface runoff lateral flow from multiple soil layers fast discharge from the saturated zone and slower baseflow from the saturated zone the soil water process component is the central part of the model that connects the evapotranspiration surface subsurface flow and groundwater storage the spatial distribution of precipitation in ages is estimated by the inverse distance weighting interpolation method ages quantifies the interception storage from precipitation at each hru based on the land use pattern and vegetation leaf area currently the model incorporates two alternative methods of soil infiltration eagleson method eagleson 1970 and curve number method coleman et al 2016 in this section we present an application of ages to estimate blue green and grey water across an intensively managed watershed located in the semiarid usa the major consumption or footprint of crops is quantified as et calculating wfg based on the model output for a rainfed agricultural field is readily accessible because the blue water resources do not influence it in irrigated crops differentiating the amount of et from green water i e rainfall and blue water i e irrigation is challenging after running the model with selected irrigation options e g surface or sprinkler irrigation one can calculate the total water evapotranspired during the crop growing season from the model output one widely practiced method to quantify the blue water et wfb is calculating the difference between total water evapotranspired and et during the rainfed conditions wfg e g mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 2011 hoogeveen et al 2015 in this study we followed this method for quantifying the wfg and wfb across the irrigated fields however irrigation and precipitation water mix in the root zone before being transpired and rooting depth under rainfed and irrigated conditions may differ and affect the water uptake by plants therefore this approach may overestimate or underestimate the spatiotemporal distribution of et across the watershed simulating the crop rooting depth hoekstra 2019a b and estimating moisture supply green water storage in the root zone often remain uncertain in research mishra et al 2015 therefore we considered the top two soil layers for quantifying green water storage soil horizon depth considered in the study is based on ssurgo soil data where the average soil depth 70 cm the total blue water is calculated as the sum of surface and subsurface flow from the calibrated ages model our study also considered the wfy produced due to crop management practices and wastewater treatment plants wwtps the wfy nitrate for the bdcw is calculated using eq 1 where the natural nitrate concentration is derived from the national atmospheric deposition program 6 1 study area description and data the big dry creek watershed bdcw area 280 km2 is an intensively managed mixed agri cultural and suburban watershed located in the semiarid region of eastern colorado usa fig 3 most of the precipitation in the watershed occurs as rainfall in the summer and the annual average precipitation in the watershed is 315 mm the headwater area of bdcw is rocky flats which consists of grassland the watershed is substantially influenced by the standley lake reservoir located in the upper basin which supplies water to the downstream agricultural land and by discharges from the three major domestic wastewater treatment plants wwtps broomfield westminster and northglenn diversion structures irrigated and non irrigated agricultural fields the central portion of the watershed is comprised of mostly suburban land which is a mixture of residential commercial and industrial areas the lower watershed is focused on agricultural activities including corn alfalfa winter wheat and pastureland veettil et al 2021 inflows to big dry creek from standley reservoir and three wwtps provide continuous baseflow and nutrient loads these inlet flows play critical roles in controlling the blue and grey water components in the bdcw various spatiotemporal input data to run the ages model and the sources obtained are provided in table 3 the upper watershed area including standley reservoir and rocky flats is not directly modeled in our analysis the usgs 06720820 discharge gage located downstream of standley reservoir is considered the upstream inlet point of bdcw the location of bdcw and the area considered for direct modeling are illustrated in fig 3 the delineation was performed using a web based watershed delineation tool called the catchment area delineation cadel tool which delineates watershed boundaries sub catchments spatially explicit hrus each hru has spatial reference and geospatial attribute table and stream network inside each sub catchment https alm engr colostate edu cb wiki 42641 here the hrus in the cropland are delineated by preserving the boundaries of irrigated crop fields this method facilitates the simulation of spatially explicit crop management practices e g irrigation fertilizer application in the fields the final cadel result generated 1551 hrus distributed over 16 sub catchments the crop management practices especially in the irrigated fields were identified using the land use and agricultural management practices web service lamps kipka et al 2016 a detailed explanation of this ages model project development is provided by veettil et al 2021 in this study the eagleson 1970 method quantifies the infiltration amount to the soil profile which depends on the soil characteristics such as hydraulic conductivity field capacity and soil porosity crop management practices in a watershed have a substantial role in managing the three components of the total water footprint wfg wfb and wfy however we do not have a perfect record of crop management practices in the watershed based on the application of lamps the major crops in the watershed are identified as corn alfalfa winter wheat and pasture like swat ages provides an option for auto irrigation which works based on the water content available in the medium pore storage mps below field capacity whenever the water content in the mps falls below a threshold set by the user the model will apply irrigation to the field the total seasonal irrigation amount required for each crop i e input irrigation amount and fertilizer application rates in the region were obtained from colorado state university extension schneekloth and andales 2017 model performance evaluation the stream flow and nitrate flow in the bdcw was calibrated using luca let us calibrate hay and umemoto 2007 a multi objective stepwise and automated calibration tool that works based on shuffled complex evolution sce algorithm duan et al 1994 the stream flow is calibrated against a usgs flow gaging station located in the watershed outlet and the nitrate concentration is calibrated for six water quality gaging stations obtained from the big dry creek watershed association located in the interior watershed finally the model calibration was performed at a daily scale for 2012 2018 using the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 as an objective function and tested for 2010 and 2011 years with greater uncertainty of the inputs from wwtps performance of the model was further evaluated using the percent bias pbias coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse in the case of streamflow calibration the daily model simulation results show very good agreement with observed usgs flow at the watershed outlet for instance the calibrated kge value was 0 88 and the nse was 0 77 the values of daily and monthly model performance of ages for the streamflow simulation are pbias 0 68 r2 0 78 nse 0 77 and kge 0 88 based on the 2012 2018 period veettil et al 2021 in addition ages was able to represent the nutrient fluxes in the interior watershed adeptly table 4 6 2 spatial distribution of blue and green water hydrological components such as surface water flow interflow and groundwater flow from the calibrated ages were used to calculate the blue water across the hrus of bdcw each flow is computed as the net flux from an hru to an adjacent hru and a stream reach deep percolation recharges groundwater and may also be considered a part of the net groundwater return flow the spatial distribution of mean annual blue water across the hrus of bdcw for the model calibration period 2012 2018 is illustrated in fig 4 a the spatial distribution of blue water was found to be influenced by the rainfall and land use pattern of the watershed veettil and mishra 2018 karabulut et al 2016 the upper watershed area receives a relatively higher amount of annual precipitation where the hrus showed higher values of blue water ranging from 100 mm to more than 500 mm the major land use pattern of the upper watershed area is urban which generates a higher amount of surface water return flow the average blue water at the lower watershed area where most irrigated agricultural fields are located is drastically lower than the upper watershed area however the groundwater return flow and the lateral flow at these hrus were higher than the hrus in the upper watershed which indicates that the surface water return flows highly influences the blue water resources in the bdcw the spatial distribution of green water storage across the bdcw is illustrated in fig 4b unlike blue water green water storage showed relatively less variation throughout the bdcw the maximum green water storage was observed in the central part of the watershed where the precipitation is also high here the green water storage is quantified by neglecting the irrigation application in the bdcw because green water storage is the soil moisture available from the precipitation therefore considering the irrigation amount in green water storage calculation will lead to inaccurate over estimation of green water storage veettil and mishra 2020 hoekstra et al 2011 the lower watershed area showed comparatively less green water storage ranging from 200 mm to 350 mm most of the lower watershed area is comprised of loess soils with relatively high infiltration capacities therefore a relatively low rainfall will lead to lower green water storage in these hrus conservation practices such as residue management and practicing no till agriculture may improve the amount of green water storage in the lower part of bdcw the analysis of green water storage indicates that the lower bdcw may not be capable of practicing rainfed agriculture therefore enormous blue water resources irrigation applications are required to optimize crop yield 6 3 spatial distribution of blue green and grey water footprint identifying the sources blue i e irrigation or green water i e rainfall of plant water consumption is important particularly in water scarce regions the wfb and wfg calculated from the irrigated agricultural fields of bdcw are illustrated in fig 5 a and 5b respectively it is observed that the wfb from most of the irrigated agricultural fields is relatively higher than the wfg in particular alfalfa showed a maximum wfb 450 mm to 550 mm and winter wheat showed a lesser wfb whereas the wfg in most fields varied from 150 mm to 450 mm it is also important that in a semiarid region most irrigation goes to et therefore in general wfb is higher than wfg in semiarid watersheds the total wfb observed during 2012 2018 was 28 km3 year which was nine percent greater than the total wfg quantified for the bdcw as mentioned alfalfa takes the largest share in the wfb 54 of total wfb followed by hay pasture 21 in the case of wfg the alfalfa contributed only 30 to the total wfg whereas winter wheat showed a higher wfg which contributes 41 of the total wfg according to the colorado state university extension department schneekloth and andales 2017 winter wheat s estimated seasonal water requirement is less than other crops and a major portion is received from effective precipitation over the basin the seasonal water requirement for alfalfa and pasture is higher than other major crops in the watershed which is provided as supplemental irrigation overall the total water requirement wfb wfg of the major crops in the bdcw is 53 75 km3 year where most of the blue water is consumed by alfalfa and winter wheat consumes primarily green water in this study we considered the crop management practices fertilizer application and the inflow from the wwtps as the sources of wfy in the bdcw the spatial distribution of wfy across irrigated agricultural fields is illustrated in fig 5c a higher amount of wfy in the bdcw is observed in the cornfields the agronomic application of nitrate fertilizer in the cornfields is higher than the remaining crops this may be a reason for higher wfy contribution from the cornfields most of the winter wheat fields also showed a higher amount of wfy however not unexpectedly spatial variation of grey water does not follow the spatial pattern of green water or blue water since it also considers the natural background concentration of the stream network overall the results show that grey water is highly associated with the fertilizer application rate and the variation of wfy is much higher than wfb and wfg for bdcw 7 other models physically distributed hydrological models are useful for quantifying blue water green water storage and wfg the aforementioned hydrological models may not evaluate the wfb in different sectors such as thermoelectric power generation mining and industry however these models can be applied for calculating the wfb from irrigation water use in addition several studies have applied cropwat to quantify wf from various agricultural crops chapagain and hoekstra 2011 chapagain and hoekstra 2007 gerbens leenes et al 2009 kongboon and sampattagul 2012 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 like swat and ages a user can specify input irrigation scheduling options in cropwat there are many ways to model et and crop growth including the epic crop modeling framework williams et al 1989 williams 1995 also available in grid based form gepic liu et al 2007 and aquacrop fao 2010 other models applied for quantifying the crop wf calculation which depends on water budget equation are polycrop nana et al 2014 decision support system for agrotechnology transfert cropping system model dssat csm dalla marta et al 2012 and lund potsdam jena managed land lpjml rost et al 2008 8 discussion and concluding remarks a proper water security assessment is essential for facilitating the increasing freshwater demand to satisfy human needs and sustain ecosystem health within a watershed the water security assessment should focus on the managing strategies such as increasing crop yield by reducing blue water footprint and reducing the stress on blue water resources by focusing on the rainfed agricultural practices this study reviewed the concept and necessity of water security assessment by focusing on water security indicators we also reviewed the application of different physically based hydrological models such as soil and water assessment tool swat and variable infiltration capacity vic on water security assessment to illustrate the water security assessment based on blue green and grey water footprint a fully distributed agricultural ecosystems service ages model is applied in an intensively managed watershed in the semiarid colorado state the following conclusions are drawn from this water security assessment a rapidly growing population and associated increases in water demands of different sectors such as agriculture domestic municipal and industrial water usage strongly impacted regional water scarcity economic development and dietary shift towards more meat based products changing land use and climate patterns cause stress on blue and green water resources b excessive nutrient pollutant loading from wastewater treatment plants to the stream network and the nutrient flow from highly managed agricultural fields contribute towards water quality deterioration resulting in water security issues at a regional scale however most water security analyses only focus on the water quantity aspect which will lead to the under estimation of water security issues in a region evaluation of grey water indices for nutrient discharge zones can indicate the degree of water quality degradation of a watershed therefore expanding water quality monitoring gauges in a river network is essential to achieving this goal c the water security assessment often ignores the return flows after consumptive use return flows can often be reused and thus do not necessarily contribute to water scarcity therefore water footprint based analysis that accounts for both water consumption and return flows can provide a comprehensive picture of water scarcity over a watershed d several modeling approaches are proposed to quantify water security at local to global scales hydrological models such as soil and water assessment tool swat and variable infiltration capacity vic are useful to quantify blue green water availability and footprints hydrological agricultural system models cannot quantify evapotranspiration from irrigation and rainwater separately therefore independent quantification of blue and green water footprint from the irrigated field is challenging e we quantified the blue green and grey water footprint indicators across a semiarid watershed located in colorado state by applying the agricultural ecosystems services ages model the fully distributed nature of ages allows the user to calculate blue green and grey water footprint explicitly from each hru the total blue water footprint observed during 2012 2018 was 28 km3 year nine percent higher than the total green water footprint in the watershed alfalfa consumes the largest share of the blue water footprint 54 of the total wfb followed by hay pasture 21 in the case of green water footprint alfalfa contributed only 30 to the total green water footprint the spatial distribution of grey water footprint is strongly related to fertilizer application and the variation of grey water footprint across the irrigated parcels was relatively higher than blue and green water footprint credit authorship contribution statement anoop valiya

3541,water security plays an important role in socio economic development ecosystem management and environmental sustainability over the last four decades water security assessment has attracted much political and economic attention an improved understanding of the relationships between water demand and supply is needed to mitigate the impacts of diminishing water resources this study provides an overview of water security assessment by focusing on the various water security indicators and the concept of water footprint blue green and grey water the water security indicators based on the water footprint concept is currently receiving more attention because it accounts for the return flow from the total water withdrawn from a watershed we also investigate the application of different physically based hydrological models such as soil and water assessment tool swat and variable infiltration capacity vic on water security assessment at a regional to continental scale however hydrological agricultural system models cannot quantify evapotranspiration from irrigation and rainwater separately therefore independent quantification of blue and green water footprint from an irrigated field is challenging for illustration purposes we apply the fully distributed agricultural ecosystems services ages model in the big dry creek watershed bdcw an intensively managed and irrigated watershed located in semiarid colorado the results indicate that the blue water footprint is higher than the green water footprint in the watershed in addition the spatial distribution of grey water footprint is highly correlated with the amount of fertilizer application the variation of grey water footprint among the irrigated fields is higher than blue and green water footprints we conclude that applying a physically distributed model can provide useful insight into the impact of climate and anthropogenic activities on water security at different scales keywords water security indicators water footprint physically distributed models swat ages 1 introduction the shortage of freshwater resources is a daunting reality and the current manifestation is that two thirds of the global population lives under severe water scarcity at least one month of a year mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 he et al 2021 stenzel et al 2021 in addition the global risk report world economic forum 2015 identified that the crisis due to water scarcity has the highest impact in the current global situation meanwhile it is anticipated that by 2050 the global population will increase up to 32 and the corresponding food demand will increase up to 60 boretti and rosa 2019 therefore since the late 1980s water scarcity research has been identified as one of the key elements for formulating policies at global and regional scales liu et al 2017a b the linkage of freshwater shortage with rapidly growing population associated with increasing demand in different water sectors such as agriculture domestic and municipal water usage sectors are well documented veettil and mishra 2016 2020 2018 wada et al 2017 2011 kummu et al 2010 oki and kanae 2006a b vörösmarty et al 2000 the changing pattern of land use and climate variables stresses the hydrologic cycle thereby affecting local and regional water security veettil and mishra 2018 2020 ipcc 2014 2021 however quantifying the effect of climate change on water security is challenging due to the uncertainties associated with climate model projections particularly for the pattern and magnitude of precipitation schewe et al 2014 in addition the intensity and characteristics of water scarcity impact due to climate change can vary substantially from region to region and the magnitude of scarcity is coupled with population growth expansion of agriculture and industrialization abbaspour et al 2009 haddeland et al 2014 moreover it is surprisingly challenging to assess whether the water scarcity in a region is related to supply i e available water or lack of better water demand management among different sectors water security depicts the acceptable level of water related risk of a water resource while satisfying the need for livelihood human well being economic and ecosystem functioning un 2013 rodrigues et al 2014 grey and sadoff 2007 water security of a region is addressed by the concepts of water stress shortage and scarcity related to the accessibility of population to the freshwater resources veettil and mishra 2018 2020 here water scarcity depicts the long term water imbalance between demand and supply eu 2007 formulating water management policies at global regional national and local scales may obfuscate the scenarios of water scarcity and drought pereira et al 2002 therefore understanding the fundamental difference between water scarcity and drought is crucial a comprehensive overview of drought including drought classification propagation and drought indices from a user perspective is provided in mishra and singh 2010 recently physically distributed hydrological modeling has been widely used to comprehensively evaluate water security at different spatiotemporal scales veettil and mishra 2018 2020 florke et al 2018 wada et al 2017 2014 hydrological models such as swat soil and water assessment tool arnold et al 1998 srinivasan et al 1998 and vic variable infiltration capacity liang et al 1994 wood et al 1997 can be used to predict and design sustainable water management policies concerning the changing climate land use and growing population ma et al 2020 in this study we applied a fully distributed model called the agricultural ecosystems services ages model green et al 2014 2015 ascough et al 2015 to an intensively managed suburban and agricultural watershed located in the semiarid region to quantify different water security indicators the specific objectives of this study are 1 to provide an overview of water security assessment by focusing on various water security indicators and the concept of blue green and grey water footprints 2 to review the existing hydrological and agricultural system models which can be applied to quantifying water security indicators 3 to illustrate the water security assessment based on blue green and grey water footprint by applying a fully distributed agricultural ecosystems service ages model in an intensively managed and highly irrigated watershed in the semiarid colorado state the manuscript is organized as follows section 1 1 discusses the concept and need for water security assessment section 1 2 discusses the water security indicators section 2 discusses the water footprint wf concept section 3 discusses the sectoral application of water footprint concepts section 4 explains the quantification of green and blue water scarcity section 5 discusses the role of various hydrological models in water security assessment the application of ages and major findings are discussed in subsequent sections 1 1 concept and need for water security assessment in the past the use of the term water security has increased across a wide range of disciplines cook and bakker 2012 the world economic forum wef and unesco s institute for water education prioritized water security as a significant global risk linking the web of food energy climate and economic growth challenges mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 liu et al 2017a b vörösmarty et al 2021 in addition to rapid population growth diets in society are shifting toward more livestock based products schyns et al 2019 2015 molden 2007 and the water footprints related to such products are substantial erb et al 2009 odegard and van der voet 2014 the sustainable development goals sdgs aim to develop across multiple sectors such as clean energy zero hunger no poverty and clean water and sanitation water security is essential to meet most sdgs by 2030 unesco 2019 however recent studies indicate that water security s importance has been highly underestimated vörösmarty et al 2018 therefore sdgs context requires significant worldwide involvement to redirect the current downward trajectory in water security goals in addition the climate projections based analysis suggests less reliable freshwater in the 21st century than in the 20th century with observations that wet regions become wetter and dry regions become drier kumar et al 2014 leading to increasingly vulnerable water security in dry regions in addition the policies for energy production from biomass create stress on water resources hejazi et al 2014 according to stenzel et al 2021 the additional water withdrawal for bioenergy crop irrigation may create more water stress the population living under severe water stress would double compared to today because of the additional water withdrawal and even exceed the impact of climate change therefore future water availability and use studies need to include the possibility of new high demands for water from a growing bioenergy sector the excessive loading of pollutants into water bodies is another important factor that threatens water security van vliet et al 2017 mishra et al 2021 urbanization untreated water from industries and households and nonpoint sources of pollution from agricultural fields contribute toward water quality deterioration mostly in developing countries as a result water scarcity is considerably changed in many regions van vliet et al 2017 mishra et al 2021 however most analyses of global water security are focused on the water quantity aspects whereas the water usage in each sector depends on water quality for example salinity and nutrients are major concerns in irrigated agriculture and water temperature is important in the thermoelectric power sector therefore it is crucial to consider both water quantity and quality while performing water scarcity analyses monitoring water quality in stream channels and addressing its impact on water security is still a major issue evaluation of grey water indices for nutrient discharge zones can indicate the degree of water quality degradation of a stream aldaya et al 2020 liu et al 2017a b wu et al 2012 therefore expanding water monitoring gauges in the global river network is essential to achieving this goal mishra and coulibaly 2010 however water quality models are being developed to provide relevant water quality information particularly in data scarce regions unep 2016 harmel et al 2006 the impact of climate change on water security is a fundamental concern he et al 2021 dolan et al 2021 that causes more extreme floods and droughts globally konapala et al 2020 the water management practices in many regions are not adequately designed to handle the impacts of climate change on the reliability of water supply flood and drought risk agriculture energy and ecosystems moreover the land area subject to severe water scarcity is likely to be more than double that in the present trnka et al 2019 and a rigorous regional prediction of water supply trends is substantially more complicated than analyzing the global picture water scarcity may lead to devastating consequences such as eradicating aquatic systems extinction of species water borne diseases and growing regional and international risks of conflicts related to water sharing di baldassarre et al 2019 gleick 1998 therefore regional and global planning of water allocation in different sectors are necessary to address the following concerns i the amount percentage of water that can be used by a population from a particular water resource ii criteria for farmers to access a water resource iii the amount of water required to maintain the environmental flow with acceptable quality and iv the percentage of water we should leave for future use however long term water planning and technological investments e g massive infrastructure are critical for sustainable and improved water security gleick 2003 vörösmarty et al 2010 although natural and artificial reservoirs structures help increase regional renewable freshwater resources maintaining an environmental flow is vital for ecological health oki and kanae 2006a b vanham et al 2018 based on monthly water scarcity analysis hoekstra et al 2012 observed that most river basins worldwide are going through low moderate or significant water scarcity for at least one month of a given year therefore water security assessment by considering water availability supply and demand is necessary for stakeholders to develop appropriate policies for improving water management in a changing environment 1 2 water security indicators since the 1980s many water security indicators have been developed to evaluate the status of freshwater accessibility liu et al 2017a b srinivasan et al 2017 pedro monzonís et al 2015 brown and matlock 2011 rijsberman 2006 seckler et al 1999 falkenmark 1989 these indicators may also explain and mitigate long term water supply challenges socioeconomic status and environmental risks also these indices are primary measurement tools for assessing the water scarcity of a region or a sector e g economic social or ecological table 1 presents the most widely employed water security indices among more than 150 indices identified damkjaer and taylor 2017 typically a water security indicator is quantified based on water availability consumption population water usage in different sectors and environmental flow requirement efr water security indicators which received significant global attention were derived during the late 1980s nouri et al 2019 liu et al 2017a b have been used to analyze population driven water stress on the global freshwater resources srinivasan et al 2017 falkenmark 2013 for instance the falkenmark index flk falkenmark 1989 the fraction of total runoff streamflow available for human use evaluates the volume of freshwater per capita share m3 person year is the most widely employed water security indicator for representing differences in water availability between countries karabulut et al 2016 damkjaer and taylor 2017 pedro monzonís et al 2015 brown and matlock 2011 based on the per capita water usage the falkenmark index of a region is categorized as no stress flk 1700 m3 person year stress scarcity or absolute scarcity flk 500 m3 person year this index clearly distinguishes between climate and human induced water scarcity vörösmarty et al 2005 however flk omits major variations in water demand among countries due to culture lifestyle and climate rijsberman 2006 also the index does not reflect the transparent spatial distribution of domestic industrial and agricultural water demand distinctly schewe et al 2014 ohisson 2000 modified flk by incorporating the influence of industrial economic or other sectors on water demand and formulated the social water stress index swsi the ratio of water use to availability is a widely accepted water scarcity indicator which addresses the volume of water used and connects it to the available freshwater resources alcamo and henrichs 2002 liu et al 2017a b here water use refers to the total volume of water withdrawal by different sectors consumptive use and the available water can be an actual runoff or actual runoff minus efr environmental flow requirement the measurements focused on the withdrawals ignore the return flows after consumptive use and thus do not provide a comprehensive picture of water scarcity over a watershed veettil and mishra 2016 for instance in most thermoelectric power plants less than three to five percent of water withdrawn is consumed through evaporation whereas 85 of total water use is considered consumption in the irrigation sector therefore in water security assessment we need to consider the consumptive water use net water abstraction rather than water withdrawal because return flows can often be reused and thus do not necessarily contribute to water scarcity researchers have developed many physically based models that address spatiotemporal changes in sectoral water demand and availability since the early 2000s water security analysis based on the water footprint concept hoekstra et al 2011 that includes blue green and grey water footprints are considered appropriate for addressing water security at regional to global scale 2 the water footprint concept the water footprint wf concept developed by hoekstra 2003 was initiated to develop a suitable indicator to evaluate increasing human consumption of freshwater resources and to address the rising opportunity cost of freshwater use in different sectors chenoweth et al 2014 wf is a multidimensional indicator capable of calculating water consumption for i a person ii growing populations iii a process iv a product v a river basin or vi a nation the wf is classified into blue green and grey water fig 1 additionally quantifying consumptive water use will provide a more accurate assessment of the amount of water required for production and better determine the water security hotspot marston et al 2018 konar and marston 2020 a comprehensive explanation of the wf concept and classification is provided in the following sections 2 1 blue and green water footprint precipitation falling on a landscape is partitioned into different components such as evapotranspiration soil moisture and runoff traditional water resources planning and management focus on the efficiency and economics of water storage and diversion of runoff hoekstra 2019a b but this approach fails to efficiently allocate the evaporative component hoekstra 2019a b schyns et al 2019 addressing water security issues and identifying source areas by classifying freshwater resources based on color is an appropriate method for proper water management chenoweth et al 2014 schneider 2013 in addition this concept links the depletion of water resources and increasing population needs here blue water refers to the total volume of surface and subsurface water stored in lakes aquifers and manmade structures and accessible for human consumption falkenmark and rockström 2010 rockström et al 2009 rodrigues et al 2014 hoekstra et al 2011 blue water footprint wfb is the consumptive water use from blue water resources that can be calculated as the volume of surface groundwater consumed for the production of goods e g power production irrigation or service e g domestic water use public water use more systematically the wfb in a watershed is the difference between water withdrawal abstraction and returned flow hoekstra et al 2011 chapagain and tickner 2012 broadly green water is defined as the soil water stored in the vadose zone and vegetation canopy derived from the precipitation and available to the plant roots and soil biota rockström et al 2009 rost et al 2008 veettil and mishra 2016 2020 green water footprint wfg indicates the volume of rainwater consumed during the production process and is relevant for agricultural and forestry products hoekstra 2019a b hoekstra et al 2011 roughly in a continental scale 65 of precipitation produces green water and the remaining 35 forms blue water falkenmark and rockström 2010 and it is evident that 67 of the global crop system still comes from rainfed agriculture portmann et al 2010 where the water consumption purely depends on green water moreover 80 of the global green water footprint is associated with global agricultural production liu et al 2009 which incorporates animal products food crops and bioenergy crops mekonnen and hoekstra 2012a b 2011 however the importance of distinctly quantifying the blue and green water footprints requires further research to use them precisely and explicitly hoekstra 2019a b mekonnen and hoekstra 2020 falkenmark and rockstrum 2006 differentiated green water into two components i green water storage which refers to the total moisture in the soil ii green water flow which indicates the actual evaporation non productive part and actual transpiration productive part link et al 2021 veettil and mishra 2016 a few research considers this productive part as green water flux rost et al 2008 further the concept is indistinct whether it represents evapotranspiration et only from rainwater stored in the soil or includes irrigation or other blue water sources hoekstra 2019a b in addition the blue and green water terms are used to define water use instead of total water resource availability e g chenoweth et al 2014 therefore all these obscurities may result in avoiding the usage or application of the blue and green water concept in the hydrological communities hoekstra 2019a b 2 2 grey water footprint grey water footprint wfy indicates the potential water quality impairment caused by the production of good or service and it is defined as the amount of dilution water freshwater required to assimilate the concentration of nutrients chemicals to approximate the natural original concentration of a given stream aldaya et al 2020 hoekstra et al 2012 wu et al 2012 2021 in general the water quality assessment for a river basin is performed based on the flow of nutrients pollutants released from agricultural fields nitrogen phosphorus potassium and lime as well as the effluent flow from wastewater treatment facilities yan et al 2021 humbird et al 2011 here wfy serves as an index for investigating the water quality standard of available water in that river basin this index is calculated as the ratio of nutrient load to the allowable nutrient load in the region for instance in the case of nitrate no3 load 1 wf y l n o 3 n o 3 max c n o 3 where lno3 is the nitrate loading in mass time in water bodies as a result of nitrogen inputs e g fertilizer application wwtp inflow no3max is the maximum allowable nitrate concentration in ambient water quality standards the value set by the epa is 0 01 kg m3 for human consumption cno3 is the natural nitrate concentration in the stream network nitrate is identified as the largest component in grey water because its loading far exceeds other nutrients in general wu et al 2012 2021 aldaya et al 2020 however the scientific validity of wfy concept has been criticized for instance gawel and bernsen 2011 stated that grey water is fictional or a theoretical concept that does not reflect the opportunity cost associated with production and consumptive use in addition accurate measurement of the background pollutant concentration of streams is challenging the allowable concentration value is not formulated for most nutrients and regions chenoweth et al 2014 moreover the blue and green water footprint illustrates the pressure on water resources while grey water is an environmental impact indicator 3 sectoral application of water footprint concept the application of the wf concept is rapidly increasing in most sectors e g food production energy projects and industry these analyses are performed on a regional or river basin scale to a continental or global scale a wf assessment aims to evaluate how human actions contribute to blue and green water scarcity and pollution grey water issues the assessment helps quantify the impact of wf on the environmental social and economic sectors and frame a strategy for solving the pressure on water resources according to the food and agricultural organization the wf concept can produce beneficial means of evaluating virtual water flow through the trade of food and other commodities dalin et al 2019 hoekstra 2019a and of generating public awareness on global water usage and related water scarcity in this section we provide an overview of the application of wf concept in different sectors such as food production biofuel production and some other sectors including industry mining and energy production 3 1 food production sector the water footprint of major food crops has been analyzed to provide a clear picture of freshwater consumption during the production process hoekstra 2017 lovarelli et al 2016 for example mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 quantified global crop production s green blue and grey wf using the cropwat model globally the total volume of wf estimated for 126 crops was 7404 billion cubic meters per year with 78 green 12 blue and 10 grey wf for example wf for wheat was 1827 m3 ton wfg of 1277 m3 ton a wfb of 342 m3 ton and a wfy of 207 m3 ton in addition the wf of major crops e g rice varies significantly from region to region chapagain and hoekstra 2011 zhuo et al 2016 significant rice production is observed in south asian countries where cultivation is mainly carried out in the wet season therefore the contribution of blue water scarcity is negligible in those areas the water footprint of animal products is relatively higher than the crop products with equivalent nutritional value mekonnen and hoekstra 2012a b hoekstra 2017 for example beef s average wf per calorie is 20 times larger than cereals and starchy roots and wf per gram of protein for milk eggs and chicken meat is 1 5 times larger than for pulses in general industrial livestock products consume and pollute more blue water resources than the products from grazing systems global animal production requires about 2 422 gm3 of water per year of which 87 2 is wfg 6 2 is wfb and 6 6 is wfy mekonnen and hoekstra 2012a b therefore the rising global meat consumption and the intensification of animal production systems will further pressure the global freshwater resources in the impending decades zhuo et al 2016 the wf analysis for various food crops and animal products is provided in table 2 a 3 2 biofuel energy production sector anthropogenic greenhouse gas ghg emission has been the most significant contributor to climate change since the mid 20th century and the majority is from the energy and transportation sectors scown et al 2011 mbow et al 2017 many researchers have found the use of biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel will strongly support the reduction of ghg emissions mahbub et al 2019 kongboon and sampattagul 2012 for example the us department of energy aims to provide 16 of electricity through biofuel production by 2030 gerbens leenes et al 2012 the european council is encouraging the use of biofuels to increase by 50 by the next decade therefore assessing the wf and related water security analysis due to the biofuel production is necessary for understanding the pressure on water resources schyns et al 2019 mathioudakis et al 2017 dalla marta et al 2012 the biofuel wf varies from crop to crop and region to region depending on the climate topography type of crop and crop yield huang et al 2021 dalla marta et al 2012 for example biodiesel generally produced from coconut groundnut and cotton has a relatively high wf gerbens leenes et al 2008 in addition the wfs of sugar cane and cassava vary considerably with respect to the region climate and production systems on average the wf of sugarcane is less than that of cassava kongboon and sampattagul 2012 mathioudakis et al 2017 estimated the wf of ten crop residue types and a few bioenergy feedstocks such as miscanthus eucalyptus and pine and revealed that crop residues have a smaller wf than miscanthus and wood the higher energy use combined with an increasing contribution of energy from biomass will cause competition of water consumption with food production the application of wf concept in various bioenergy crops is listed in table 2b a comprehensive wf assessment of humanity is only possible through comparative analysis of all water usage sectors related to human water use table 2c illustrates the application of the water footprint concept in important sectors such as electricity production and mining 4 green and blue water scarcity high resolution indices are essential for addressing water security at a reliable level quantifying water scarcity as a ratio of water consumed water footprint to water available is a globally accepted metric wada et al 2011 rodrigues et al 2014 that can identify the geographic hotspot for water stress regions according to schyns et al 2019 green water scarcity gw scarcity indicates the competition for limited green water flow which is involved in the production of biomass that adds to the economy the gw scarcity can be quantified as the ratio of wfg to green water storage for example gw scarcity from a field x and period t is calculated as 2 g w s c a r c i t y x t greenwaterfootprint x t greenwaterstorage x t here the green water footprint accounts for the consumptive use of vegetation only from precipitation i e not considering the irrigation water although green water availability is limited and there are competing demands in crop production livestock grazing lands and forest ecosystems gw scarcity has not attracted much attention in water security assessment schyns et al 2019 link et al 2021 vörösmarty et al 2010 wada et al 2011 the evaluation of gw scarcity assists in addressing a nation s capability to produce enough food bioenergy and forestry products with limited blue water availability therefore like blue water scarcity bw scarcity it is critical to consider the gw scarcity and evaluate it through improved modeling approaches environmental flow requirement efr excessive utilization of blue water from a stream may damage the ecosystem health therefore application of the efr concept is mandatory for maintaining a healthy river ecosystem honrado et al 2013 hirji and davis 2009 defined the efr as a standard which maintains the functions processes and resilience of aquatic ecosystems with a minimum quality quantity and timing of water flow therefore efr has a significant role in quantifying the accurate level of blue water scarcity of a region although different methodologies e g low streamflow method adapted smakhtin methodology are developed to evaluate efr the presumptive standard method developed by richter 2010 richter et al 2012 is widely used liang et al 2021 veettil and mishra 2018 zeng et al 2012 according to the presumptive standard method water withdrawal from streamflow greater than 20 will cause degradation in ecosystem health and this available water for withdrawal is termed blue water availability veettil and mishra 2016 considering the role of blue water scarcity the united nations has identified efr as one of the sustainable development goals sdgs particularly sdg indicator 6 4 2 vanham et al 2018 efr supports a wide range of ecosystems such as fish stocks and other aquatic life which provide nutrition biomass directly to people sdg 2 zero hunger like green water scarcity bw scarcity is defined as the ratio of blue water footprint wfb to blue water availability and it highlights mismatches between water availability and water demand hoekstra et al 2011 in general bw scarcity is represented in percentage where bw scarcity 100 refers to the situation where blue water availability is fully consumed for a river basin x and period t 3 b w s c a r c i t y x t blue w a t e r f o o t p r i n t x t blue w a t e r a v a i l a b i l i t y x t 4 blue w a t e r a v a i l a b i l i t y x t t r w r e f r here the total renewable water resource trwr is the total streamflow available quantifying bw scarcity is essential for food security ecological health and economic and business prospects nouri et al 2019 rosa et al 2020 the bw scarcity of a region can be classified into four levels hoekstra et al 2012 i low blue water scarcity bw scarcity 100 where the wfb does not exceed the blue water availability and the efr is satisfied at this level ii moderate blue water scarcity bw scarcity ranges from 100 to 150 here the wfb is between 20 and 30 of natural runoff and the efr criteria are not satisfied in moderate bluewater scarcity iii significant blue water scarcity bw scarcity ranges from 150 to 200 here the wfb is between 30 and 40 of natural runoff the efr is not satisfied iv severe blue water scarcity bw scarcity 200 the monthly wfb exceeds 40 of natural runoff and the concept of efr is drastically unsatisfactory in the regions with severe blue water scarcity various studies have assessed the spatiotemporal fluxes in bw scarcity from a regional to global scale for instance mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 evaluated the global bw scarcity at a high spatial resolution i e grid cells of 30 30 arc min on a monthly basis the result shows that two thirds of the global population lives under severe water scarcity at least one month each year and the most severe hot spots identified were india and china the study also states that a previous study performed on a river basin scale hoekstra et al 2012 underestimated bw scarcity thereby increasing the number of people facing water scarcity threats water scarcity assessments on an annual basis hide the variability within a year and underestimate the areal extend of severity wada et al 2011 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 however the availability of seasonal or monthly scale actual water use data constrains the monthly seasonal scale analysis of bw scarcity excluding efr is another concern in bw scarcity assessment for example wada et al 2011 studied global water scarcity at a high spatial resolution on a monthly basis without accounting for efr and underestimated the number of people facing water scarcity mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 certain studies quantified water scarcity by considering the actual runoff and water withdrawal that will lead to the addition of uncertainty in water scarcity levels kummu et al 2014 oki and kanae 2006a b the choice of scale is a critical element that affects the outcome drawn from water scarcity analyses brunner et al 2019 water scarcity may be over or underestimated when the scale changes from local to continental scale 5 application of hydrological models for water security assessment several modeling approaches have been proposed to quantify water security on a global to local scale wada et al 2011 rodrigues et al 2014 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 veettil and mishra 2016 2020 ma et al 2020 this section reviews the different hydrological and agricultural systems modeling frameworks applied to quantify blue green grey water footprint water availability and related scarcity although a wide variety of hydrological models are available for simulating the historical and future water availability selecting a particular model is challenging because of model prediction uncertainty associated with input variables e g land use and climate model parameter calibration and scale issues in watershed modeling surfleet et al 2012 wada et al 2017 however process based spatially distributed models are capable of evaluating the hydrological or nutrient fluxes in a watershed veettil et al 2021 at various scales in addition these models can simulate streamflow and nutrient loads at interior ungauged sub catchments several studies have applied physically distributed modeling systems to quantify the water footprint water availability and related water scarcity implementation of a hydrological modeling framework to quantify blue and green water footprints availabilities and scarcities based on the simulated hydrologic and nutrient fluxes is illustrated in fig 2 the basic spatial and temporal datasets to simulate these variables include digital elevation models dem which provide the topography and hydrography of the region land use maps soil information daily weather inputs and crop management information generally streamflow and water quality data are needed for model calibration and evaluation the application of modeling frameworks such as swat vic and ages for water security assessment is explained in further sections 5 1 soil and water assessment tool swat swat is a physically based continuous time semi distributed model developed by the united states department of agriculture usda arnold et al 1998 which has been widely used for simulating the water quantity and quality for a small scale watershed cibin et al 2012 large river basins veettil and mishra 2016 to continental scales abbaspour et al 2015 recently the model has been applied for water security assessment at a regional scale rodrigues et al 2014 applied swat to estimate the blue green water availability and related water scarcity over an agricultural basin in brazil subsequently veettil and mishra 2016 2018 used swat to quantify the blue and green water scarcity across the counties located in the savannah river basin a transboundary river basin located in the semi humid eastern us the water balance components in swat are associated with blue or green water and the blue water is estimated by combining the water yield and groundwater storage rodrigues et al 2014 veettil and mishra 2016 2018 here water yield refers to the return flow from each hru hydrologic response unit the smallest spatial unit contributing to streamflow the groundwater storage is the difference between the total recharge to the deep aquifer and the shallow aquifer contributing to streamflow green water storage is the soil water content available for plant consumption and the green water footprint is the evapotranspiration veettil and mishra 2016 applied swat to quantify the blue and green water availability and green water footprint over the savannah river basin here blue water footprint is calculated from the usgs water withdrawal data the result provided an overview of the spatiotemporal changes in county level water security due to sectoral water demand and shortage of supply in the savannah river basin the potential influence of climate and land use variables on blue and green water and related water scarcity was also analyzed for the savannah river basin using swat veettil and mishra 2018 swat has also been applied to quantify the blue and green water availability of arid regions for instance abbaspour et al 2009 assessed the impact of climate change on iran s blue and green water resources in addition schuol et al 2008 used swat to quantify the water availability of african river basins the information from these models is important because most of the subbasins in those regions are ungauged and the data on reservoir management land use management and agricultural practices are limited swat was also used to evaluate the regional grey water footprint wfy for instance wu et al 2012 quantified the wfy due to the biofuel production for the counties located in iowa and girolamo et al 2019 estimated the wfy and its uncertainty for crop production in a basin located in italy using swat 5 2 variable infiltration capacity vic vic is a macroscale hydrological model liang et al 1994 liang and xie 2003 developed to simulate land atmospheric fluxes water and energy balances at independent grid cells the model routes water as surface and baseflow to the stream network veettil and mishra 2020 used the vic output to quantify blue and green water scarcity across the conus here vic version 4 0 3 output was obtained from the giovanni database which provides the modeled outputs of the north american land data assimilation system nldas rui and mocko 2013 the model output is available at a 1 80 grid scale in near real time across the conus here the blue water is quantified by combining the surface runoff and base flow to the stream network and soil water in the top one meter soil depth simulated by vic is considered the green water storage available for plant consumption in addition the analysis of gw scarcity in this study was more realistic by incorporating the rainfed agricultural parcels that avoid blue water resources irrigation the results drawn from this study indicate that water security will remain a challenge particularly in the western usa due to the compounding impacts of changing climate variables and the growing population ma et al 2020 also utilized the vic model to report the water scarcity across china which explicitly investigated water quality requirements for human use 6 application of agricultural ecosystems services ages model for blue green and grey water security assessment unlike swat and vic ages is a fully distributed watershed model capable of routing water and nutrients among the hrus smallest units inside a catchment and stream units ages is a relatively new model and the current version is continuous in time at a daily time step ascough et al 2012 green et al 2014 2015 the hydrological processes in ages were initially adapted from the j2000 krause et al 2006 and j2000 sn fink et al 2007 models the current version 0 3 0 of ages simulates surface runoff lateral flow from multiple soil layers fast discharge from the saturated zone and slower baseflow from the saturated zone the soil water process component is the central part of the model that connects the evapotranspiration surface subsurface flow and groundwater storage the spatial distribution of precipitation in ages is estimated by the inverse distance weighting interpolation method ages quantifies the interception storage from precipitation at each hru based on the land use pattern and vegetation leaf area currently the model incorporates two alternative methods of soil infiltration eagleson method eagleson 1970 and curve number method coleman et al 2016 in this section we present an application of ages to estimate blue green and grey water across an intensively managed watershed located in the semiarid usa the major consumption or footprint of crops is quantified as et calculating wfg based on the model output for a rainfed agricultural field is readily accessible because the blue water resources do not influence it in irrigated crops differentiating the amount of et from green water i e rainfall and blue water i e irrigation is challenging after running the model with selected irrigation options e g surface or sprinkler irrigation one can calculate the total water evapotranspired during the crop growing season from the model output one widely practiced method to quantify the blue water et wfb is calculating the difference between total water evapotranspired and et during the rainfed conditions wfg e g mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 2011 hoogeveen et al 2015 in this study we followed this method for quantifying the wfg and wfb across the irrigated fields however irrigation and precipitation water mix in the root zone before being transpired and rooting depth under rainfed and irrigated conditions may differ and affect the water uptake by plants therefore this approach may overestimate or underestimate the spatiotemporal distribution of et across the watershed simulating the crop rooting depth hoekstra 2019a b and estimating moisture supply green water storage in the root zone often remain uncertain in research mishra et al 2015 therefore we considered the top two soil layers for quantifying green water storage soil horizon depth considered in the study is based on ssurgo soil data where the average soil depth 70 cm the total blue water is calculated as the sum of surface and subsurface flow from the calibrated ages model our study also considered the wfy produced due to crop management practices and wastewater treatment plants wwtps the wfy nitrate for the bdcw is calculated using eq 1 where the natural nitrate concentration is derived from the national atmospheric deposition program 6 1 study area description and data the big dry creek watershed bdcw area 280 km2 is an intensively managed mixed agri cultural and suburban watershed located in the semiarid region of eastern colorado usa fig 3 most of the precipitation in the watershed occurs as rainfall in the summer and the annual average precipitation in the watershed is 315 mm the headwater area of bdcw is rocky flats which consists of grassland the watershed is substantially influenced by the standley lake reservoir located in the upper basin which supplies water to the downstream agricultural land and by discharges from the three major domestic wastewater treatment plants wwtps broomfield westminster and northglenn diversion structures irrigated and non irrigated agricultural fields the central portion of the watershed is comprised of mostly suburban land which is a mixture of residential commercial and industrial areas the lower watershed is focused on agricultural activities including corn alfalfa winter wheat and pastureland veettil et al 2021 inflows to big dry creek from standley reservoir and three wwtps provide continuous baseflow and nutrient loads these inlet flows play critical roles in controlling the blue and grey water components in the bdcw various spatiotemporal input data to run the ages model and the sources obtained are provided in table 3 the upper watershed area including standley reservoir and rocky flats is not directly modeled in our analysis the usgs 06720820 discharge gage located downstream of standley reservoir is considered the upstream inlet point of bdcw the location of bdcw and the area considered for direct modeling are illustrated in fig 3 the delineation was performed using a web based watershed delineation tool called the catchment area delineation cadel tool which delineates watershed boundaries sub catchments spatially explicit hrus each hru has spatial reference and geospatial attribute table and stream network inside each sub catchment https alm engr colostate edu cb wiki 42641 here the hrus in the cropland are delineated by preserving the boundaries of irrigated crop fields this method facilitates the simulation of spatially explicit crop management practices e g irrigation fertilizer application in the fields the final cadel result generated 1551 hrus distributed over 16 sub catchments the crop management practices especially in the irrigated fields were identified using the land use and agricultural management practices web service lamps kipka et al 2016 a detailed explanation of this ages model project development is provided by veettil et al 2021 in this study the eagleson 1970 method quantifies the infiltration amount to the soil profile which depends on the soil characteristics such as hydraulic conductivity field capacity and soil porosity crop management practices in a watershed have a substantial role in managing the three components of the total water footprint wfg wfb and wfy however we do not have a perfect record of crop management practices in the watershed based on the application of lamps the major crops in the watershed are identified as corn alfalfa winter wheat and pasture like swat ages provides an option for auto irrigation which works based on the water content available in the medium pore storage mps below field capacity whenever the water content in the mps falls below a threshold set by the user the model will apply irrigation to the field the total seasonal irrigation amount required for each crop i e input irrigation amount and fertilizer application rates in the region were obtained from colorado state university extension schneekloth and andales 2017 model performance evaluation the stream flow and nitrate flow in the bdcw was calibrated using luca let us calibrate hay and umemoto 2007 a multi objective stepwise and automated calibration tool that works based on shuffled complex evolution sce algorithm duan et al 1994 the stream flow is calibrated against a usgs flow gaging station located in the watershed outlet and the nitrate concentration is calibrated for six water quality gaging stations obtained from the big dry creek watershed association located in the interior watershed finally the model calibration was performed at a daily scale for 2012 2018 using the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 as an objective function and tested for 2010 and 2011 years with greater uncertainty of the inputs from wwtps performance of the model was further evaluated using the percent bias pbias coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse in the case of streamflow calibration the daily model simulation results show very good agreement with observed usgs flow at the watershed outlet for instance the calibrated kge value was 0 88 and the nse was 0 77 the values of daily and monthly model performance of ages for the streamflow simulation are pbias 0 68 r2 0 78 nse 0 77 and kge 0 88 based on the 2012 2018 period veettil et al 2021 in addition ages was able to represent the nutrient fluxes in the interior watershed adeptly table 4 6 2 spatial distribution of blue and green water hydrological components such as surface water flow interflow and groundwater flow from the calibrated ages were used to calculate the blue water across the hrus of bdcw each flow is computed as the net flux from an hru to an adjacent hru and a stream reach deep percolation recharges groundwater and may also be considered a part of the net groundwater return flow the spatial distribution of mean annual blue water across the hrus of bdcw for the model calibration period 2012 2018 is illustrated in fig 4 a the spatial distribution of blue water was found to be influenced by the rainfall and land use pattern of the watershed veettil and mishra 2018 karabulut et al 2016 the upper watershed area receives a relatively higher amount of annual precipitation where the hrus showed higher values of blue water ranging from 100 mm to more than 500 mm the major land use pattern of the upper watershed area is urban which generates a higher amount of surface water return flow the average blue water at the lower watershed area where most irrigated agricultural fields are located is drastically lower than the upper watershed area however the groundwater return flow and the lateral flow at these hrus were higher than the hrus in the upper watershed which indicates that the surface water return flows highly influences the blue water resources in the bdcw the spatial distribution of green water storage across the bdcw is illustrated in fig 4b unlike blue water green water storage showed relatively less variation throughout the bdcw the maximum green water storage was observed in the central part of the watershed where the precipitation is also high here the green water storage is quantified by neglecting the irrigation application in the bdcw because green water storage is the soil moisture available from the precipitation therefore considering the irrigation amount in green water storage calculation will lead to inaccurate over estimation of green water storage veettil and mishra 2020 hoekstra et al 2011 the lower watershed area showed comparatively less green water storage ranging from 200 mm to 350 mm most of the lower watershed area is comprised of loess soils with relatively high infiltration capacities therefore a relatively low rainfall will lead to lower green water storage in these hrus conservation practices such as residue management and practicing no till agriculture may improve the amount of green water storage in the lower part of bdcw the analysis of green water storage indicates that the lower bdcw may not be capable of practicing rainfed agriculture therefore enormous blue water resources irrigation applications are required to optimize crop yield 6 3 spatial distribution of blue green and grey water footprint identifying the sources blue i e irrigation or green water i e rainfall of plant water consumption is important particularly in water scarce regions the wfb and wfg calculated from the irrigated agricultural fields of bdcw are illustrated in fig 5 a and 5b respectively it is observed that the wfb from most of the irrigated agricultural fields is relatively higher than the wfg in particular alfalfa showed a maximum wfb 450 mm to 550 mm and winter wheat showed a lesser wfb whereas the wfg in most fields varied from 150 mm to 450 mm it is also important that in a semiarid region most irrigation goes to et therefore in general wfb is higher than wfg in semiarid watersheds the total wfb observed during 2012 2018 was 28 km3 year which was nine percent greater than the total wfg quantified for the bdcw as mentioned alfalfa takes the largest share in the wfb 54 of total wfb followed by hay pasture 21 in the case of wfg the alfalfa contributed only 30 to the total wfg whereas winter wheat showed a higher wfg which contributes 41 of the total wfg according to the colorado state university extension department schneekloth and andales 2017 winter wheat s estimated seasonal water requirement is less than other crops and a major portion is received from effective precipitation over the basin the seasonal water requirement for alfalfa and pasture is higher than other major crops in the watershed which is provided as supplemental irrigation overall the total water requirement wfb wfg of the major crops in the bdcw is 53 75 km3 year where most of the blue water is consumed by alfalfa and winter wheat consumes primarily green water in this study we considered the crop management practices fertilizer application and the inflow from the wwtps as the sources of wfy in the bdcw the spatial distribution of wfy across irrigated agricultural fields is illustrated in fig 5c a higher amount of wfy in the bdcw is observed in the cornfields the agronomic application of nitrate fertilizer in the cornfields is higher than the remaining crops this may be a reason for higher wfy contribution from the cornfields most of the winter wheat fields also showed a higher amount of wfy however not unexpectedly spatial variation of grey water does not follow the spatial pattern of green water or blue water since it also considers the natural background concentration of the stream network overall the results show that grey water is highly associated with the fertilizer application rate and the variation of wfy is much higher than wfb and wfg for bdcw 7 other models physically distributed hydrological models are useful for quantifying blue water green water storage and wfg the aforementioned hydrological models may not evaluate the wfb in different sectors such as thermoelectric power generation mining and industry however these models can be applied for calculating the wfb from irrigation water use in addition several studies have applied cropwat to quantify wf from various agricultural crops chapagain and hoekstra 2011 chapagain and hoekstra 2007 gerbens leenes et al 2009 kongboon and sampattagul 2012 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 like swat and ages a user can specify input irrigation scheduling options in cropwat there are many ways to model et and crop growth including the epic crop modeling framework williams et al 1989 williams 1995 also available in grid based form gepic liu et al 2007 and aquacrop fao 2010 other models applied for quantifying the crop wf calculation which depends on water budget equation are polycrop nana et al 2014 decision support system for agrotechnology transfert cropping system model dssat csm dalla marta et al 2012 and lund potsdam jena managed land lpjml rost et al 2008 8 discussion and concluding remarks a proper water security assessment is essential for facilitating the increasing freshwater demand to satisfy human needs and sustain ecosystem health within a watershed the water security assessment should focus on the managing strategies such as increasing crop yield by reducing blue water footprint and reducing the stress on blue water resources by focusing on the rainfed agricultural practices this study reviewed the concept and necessity of water security assessment by focusing on water security indicators we also reviewed the application of different physically based hydrological models such as soil and water assessment tool swat and variable infiltration capacity vic on water security assessment to illustrate the water security assessment based on blue green and grey water footprint a fully distributed agricultural ecosystems service ages model is applied in an intensively managed watershed in the semiarid colorado state the following conclusions are drawn from this water security assessment a rapidly growing population and associated increases in water demands of different sectors such as agriculture domestic municipal and industrial water usage strongly impacted regional water scarcity economic development and dietary shift towards more meat based products changing land use and climate patterns cause stress on blue and green water resources b excessive nutrient pollutant loading from wastewater treatment plants to the stream network and the nutrient flow from highly managed agricultural fields contribute towards water quality deterioration resulting in water security issues at a regional scale however most water security analyses only focus on the water quantity aspect which will lead to the under estimation of water security issues in a region evaluation of grey water indices for nutrient discharge zones can indicate the degree of water quality degradation of a watershed therefore expanding water quality monitoring gauges in a river network is essential to achieving this goal c the water security assessment often ignores the return flows after consumptive use return flows can often be reused and thus do not necessarily contribute to water scarcity therefore water footprint based analysis that accounts for both water consumption and return flows can provide a comprehensive picture of water scarcity over a watershed d several modeling approaches are proposed to quantify water security at local to global scales hydrological models such as soil and water assessment tool swat and variable infiltration capacity vic are useful to quantify blue green water availability and footprints hydrological agricultural system models cannot quantify evapotranspiration from irrigation and rainwater separately therefore independent quantification of blue and green water footprint from the irrigated field is challenging e we quantified the blue green and grey water footprint indicators across a semiarid watershed located in colorado state by applying the agricultural ecosystems services ages model the fully distributed nature of ages allows the user to calculate blue green and grey water footprint explicitly from each hru the total blue water footprint observed during 2012 2018 was 28 km3 year nine percent higher than the total green water footprint in the watershed alfalfa consumes the largest share of the blue water footprint 54 of the total wfb followed by hay pasture 21 in the case of green water footprint alfalfa contributed only 30 to the total green water footprint the spatial distribution of grey water footprint is strongly related to fertilizer application and the variation of grey water footprint across the irrigated parcels was relatively higher than blue and green water footprint credit authorship contribution statement anoop valiya

damage for items exposed to floods in this paper we introduce a non dimensional impact parameter that according to the physics of damage mechanisms and or tuned on field or lab data combines water depth and flow velocity in a general and flexible form we then suggest a general approach to assess relative damage functions for items of different nature subject to either progressive or on off damage processes the proposed method enhances traditional tools that use inundation depth as the main or only explicative variable and allows recasting the results from previous studies in an elegant flexible and unique form compared to multivariate models that link flow variables to damage directly the physics based approach allows for an intelligible assessment of flood hazard and the associated damage even in case of scarce or sparse data the proposed impact parameter and the related procedure to assess the relative damage functions are applied to different kinds of exposed items people vehicles and buildings demonstrating the general applicability and validity of the proposed method keywords damage flood hazard vulnerability vulnerability function flood risk 1 introduction flood damage assessment is a fundamental step and a key information basis in any deliberation on flood risk management being it related to long term mitigation measures or to the emergency phase see e g the european floods directive two kinds of tools are generally used to assess direct flood damage pregnolato et al 2015 fuchs et al 2019a the standard tool is represented by vulnerability curves relating hazard exposure and vulnerability to the damage usually expressed in relative terms on a scale ranging from 0 no damage to 1 total loss amadio et al 2019 dutta et al 2003 fuchs et al 2019b gerl et al 2016 krzysztofowicz and davis 1983 merz et al 2013 smith 1994 this tool is appropriate for the description of damage mechanisms and processes that allow for intermediate states of damage i e between zero and the total loss like damage to buildings crops etc these processes are referred to as progressive processes in the following in contrast to vulnerability curves fragility curves express the relationship between hazard vulnerability and the probability of having a certain damage e g haugen kaynia 2008 mcgrath et al 2019 nofal et al 2020 papathoma köhle et al 2017 pita et al 2021 thapa et al 2020 hence they are profitably used to describe binary processes in which only two states are possible i e fully safe on event or fully damaged off event and the damaging occurs very quickly hereinafter we define these processes as on off processes whose typical examples are people or vehicles in floodwater both vulnerability and fragility functions share the use of inundation depth as the main explicative variable for flood damage apel et al 2004 chen et al 2019 de moel et al 2015 gerl et al 2016 jamali et al 2018 hasanzadeh nafari et al 2017 huizinga et al 2017 jongman et al 2012 kreibich et al 2009 lv et al 2021 martínez gomariz et al 2021 zhou et al 2012 although it is widely accepted that flood damage is mainly influenced by water depth this parameter cannot fully explain damage data variance which instead can be explained by a variety of parameters related both to hazard and to vulnerability chen et al 2016 dang et al 2011 kreibich et al 2017 mcbean et al 1988 merz et al 2004 2010 molinari et al 2014 2019 pham et al 2020 thieken et al 2005 thieken et al 2008 with the latter being strongly dependent on and varying with the object under investigation and the physical and socio economic context in which the flood occurs menoni et al 2012 nonetheless vulnerability parameters are often related to socio economic aspects that can be hardly quantified koks et al 2015 and for which only a qualitative evaluation is possible like the experience of affected people their level of education the level of maintenance of a building menoni et al 2012 this makes the generalization of flood damage assessment tools as well as their adaptability and transferability in space and time a challenging task cammerer et al 2013 molinari et al 2019 molinari et al 2020 however the relationship between damage and hazard variables is more prone to generalization than that with vulnerability s as it mainly involves physical processes that can be quantified and modelled in mathematical terms in fact several studies propose qualitative fragility curves e g by expressing the probability of damage as low moderate and high as a function of different combinations of water depth and flow velocity for a variety of objects see e g cox et al 2010 penning rowsell et al 2005 ramsbottom et al 2006 limiting the analysis to direct flood damage this paper presents a general and flexible method to assess the relative damage for progressive and on off damage processes using a common framework the two main ingredients are i a new impact parameter w which allows to measure flood hazard accounting for both inundation depth and water velocity as flood damage determinants and ii a procedure to derive the relative damage as a function of w quantitatively starting from physical considerations empirical or synthetic damage data the goal is extending the traditional depth damage approach accounting for additional explicative variables as flow velocity yet retaining a relatively simple and intelligible structure an explicit physics based modelling approach is preferred because physics based damage models may provide robust results in different contexts and in novel conditions with scarce calibration data and allow modellers to improve their knowledge and to keep control on the entire process of damage assessment these aspects are valuable even in the era of big data and complex multi variate data based models whose reliability essentially depends on the quantity and quality of training data carisi et al 2018 gumiere et al 2020 merz et al 2013 molinari et al 2020 mosavi et al 2018 van ootegem et al 2015 van ootegem et al 2018 the paper is organized as follows section2 describes the proposed procedure by first introducing the impact parameter w section2 1 and then explaining how the parameter can be related to the damage degree or the probability of damage section2 2 section3 provides some practical examples on the use of the impact parameter w and on the method to derive damage models and fragility functions some comparisons with previous approaches are also shown finally section4 discusses the work and makes final remarks 2 an approach for the definition of relative damage functions before going into the details of how the impact parameter w is defined and can be used some aspects deserve clarifications for the sake of simplicity in the following we use the term relative damage functions to denote both vulnerability functions and fragility curves cardona 2004 cardona et al 2012 thywissen 2006 indeed the definition of total damage for progressive damage processes and of total loss for on off processes are very similar to each other total damage relative damage total value of exposed items total loss loss probability total number of exposed items the loss probability as the relative damage varies between 0 and 1 and increases with the hazard increasing which supports the general use of relative damage in both the cases accordingly relative damage functions can be viewed either in a deterministic sense for progressive damage processes or in a probabilistic sense for on off events depending on the nature of items exposed to floods and on flood features damage can be ascribed to many diverse processes e g wetting dragging drowning which in turn depend on different explanatory variables such as water depth and velocity flood duration contaminant load socio economic status and precautionary measures apel et al 2009 bignami et al 2019 carisi et al 2018 ettinger et al 2016 karagiorgos et al 2016 kok et al 2005 merz et al 2010 mignot et al 2019 schröter et al 2014 accordingly damage functions are typically highly multidimensional thus hard to be assessed in a comprehensible and compact form papathoma köhle et al 2019 we restrict the analysis to the direct flood damage driven by mechanical processes in this case the free variables of relative damage functions reduce to water depth and flow velocity balica et al 2013 black 1975 clausen and clark 1990 de risi et al 2013 gallegos et al 2012 hammond et al 2015 jongman et al 2012 martínez gomariz et al 2021 nadal et al 2010 postacchini et al 2019 roos et al 2003 zhou et al 2012 the importance of water velocity in shaping damage has been demonstrated especially for flash floods with respect to different damage processes such as physical damage to roads and buildings stability of people and vehicles structural damage to buildings see e g arrighi et al 2015 garrote et al 2016 kellermann et al 2015 kelman and spence 2004 kreibich et al 2009 maiwald and schwarz 2015 martínez gomariz et al 2018 mcbean et al 1988 milanesi et al 2018 postacchini et al 2021 therefore the development of models that include water velocity as an input parameter is expected to reduce flood damage variance with respect to the widely used depth damage curves e g pistrika and jonkman 2009 de moel and aerts 2011 2 1 a lumped impact parameter for measuring the flood hazard we combine the water depth y and flow velocity u into a single lumped parameter named w so as to express the relative damage as a univariate function rd rd w the parameter w is then meant to measure the intensity of the hydrodynamic conditions that effectively produces the damage aureli et al 2008 the way in which y and u combine to form w depends on the kind of exposed items and on the damage process under investigation therefore the impact parameter w is expected to assume a form that is object and process dependent from a deterministic point of view common parameters that combine flow depth and velocity are flow energy per unit weight h and momentum per unit width and weight m 1 h y u 2 2 g y 1 1 2 f 2 2 m y 2 2 u 2 y g y 2 2 1 2 f 2 where g is gravity and f u g y 1 2 the froude number noting the similarity between these two expressions we propose to use a general impact parameter w in the form 3 w y y w α 1 β f 2 with y w 0 α 1 β 0 in which yw is a reference depth that scales the actual water depth y and α and β are two calibration factors that measure the relative importance of the static versus the dynamic component of w through a proper choice of the two calibration factors w can express the physically relevant concepts of water depth y with α 1 and β 0 of flow energy h with α 1 and β 0 5 and of momentum m with α 2 and β 2 thereby α and β change the nature of w among depth energy and force momentum the key idea is that with suitable calibration factors α and β iso w lines in the u y plane can identify different flow conditions that are equivalent in terms of damaging potential for specific categories of objects and processes the goal can be achieved as the structure of w is able to resemble the physics of the damage process advantages of using the impact parameter w include w is non dimensional it increases monotonically with the damage and can be arbitrarily scaled through a proper choice of the reference depth yw for example w can conveniently range from 0 to 1 the use of w reduces the dimensionality of the problem and allows for an immediate and intuitive assessment of the hazard degree in addition the use of a lumped parameter for identifying the hazard intensity makes the relative damage functions simpler non dimensional and more elegant how the calibration parameters α and β affect the meaning of w is shown in panels a c of fig 1 where for yw 1 m three isolines for w 0 1 w 0 5 and w 1 are plotted in the u y plane fig 1a β 1 shows that by increasing α the static part of w plays a more important role the isolines reduce their slope and the impact of velocity is lower fig 1a shows that iso w lines move upwards with increasing α as a general rule α 1 makes w a good indicator when damage is essentially produced by wetting i e water depth or energy are most involved whereas α 2 is best suited when damage or loss are mainly produced by dragging i e static and dynamic forces are most involved fig 1b α 1 and fig 1c α 2 show that increasing values of β correspond to an increasing role of flow velocity since iso w lines become steeper whereas β 0 reduces w to a static parameter depending only on the water depth the calibration factors of w can be assessed by developing physical models of the damaging process and by analysing critical damaging conditions a further fine tuning of model parameters might stem from the comparison with available field or lab data here we present a brief overview of the approach details on the method and data are given in section 3 let s consider for example the case of people and vehicles exposed to flood flow both these categories of objects are subject to dragging which is a matter of forces this suggests choosing α 2 as for the momentum equation 2 kvocka et al 2016 physics based models as those by arrighi et al 2015 arrighi et al 2017 milanesi et al 2015 and milanesi and pilotti 2019 provide instability conditions that can be represented by w 1 iso lines leading to yw 1 25 m α 2 0 β 4 0 for people and yw 0 9 m α 2 0 β 0 6 for vehicles fig 1d shows in the u y plane extreme hazard conditions for people black dots and vehicles green dots exposed to floods corresponding to the stability loss the arrangement of dots clearly shows that limit conditions exist in terms of maximum resistance to flood for both people and vehicles these limit conditions correspond to relatively large water depths when the flow velocity is low and to relatively shallow water depths when the flow velocity is large in the same fig 1d the w 1 isolines described above black and green lines for people and vehicles respectively envelop well the available experimental data confirming the proper parameterization this simple example shows the capability of the impact parameter w of describing extreme hazard conditions of items that behave quite differently from one another the very different values of β needed to fit the experimental data prove the different role played by water depth and flow velocity for people and vehicles quantitatively providing useful insights for risk management 2 2 the method to derive relative damage functions once the hazard conditions are assessed through the lumped impact parameter w the second point is relating w to the damage in other words continuous functions providing the relative damage or the probability of off events should be determined for any value of w the method to construct the relative damage functions is based on the correspondence between iso w and iso rd lines this correspondence descends from the fact that rd rd w is a univariate function for progressive damage processes the structure of the impact parameter w is determined to make iso w lines matching the shape of iso rd lines then a set of couples w rd is easily found for on off processes the tuning of w is based on the knowledge of hazard conditions related to off events which corresponds to rd 1 conditions the relative damage is then given by the cumulative frequency distributions cfd of w associated to the off events finally w rd couples or discrete cfds can be suitably approximated to provide the relative damage functions 3 applications in the present section the lumped impact parameter w and the procedure to construct the relative damage functions are applied to three cases of practical interest given that the definition of relative damage and its assessment slightly differ when considering on off or progressive damage processes we analyse the stability of people and vehicles for the first type of process and the damaging of buildings for the second one these applications are only aimed at describing the use of the impact parameter w and the method to assess relative damage functions showing both the advantages and the limitations of the proposed approach 3 1 stability of people in floodwaters 3 1 1 impact parameter w vulnerability of people due to stability loss in flowing water can be seen as an on off process the resistance of people to flowing water depends on different aspects such as age sex weight height and experience lind et al 2004 this suggests that different relative damage functions can be defined according to the sub categories of people considered however as long as the impact parameter w is able to capture the physical mechanisms of damage which is the same for any individual a unique structure of w given by a set yw α β can be defined for the whole population see appendix a relative damage functions for sub categories can then be defined by considering different values for the impact parameter here for simplicity we consider only two broad sub categories namely adults and children assuming the loss of balance as full damage condition the calibration factors of w are estimated starting from a physical point of view considering the stability of a human body in floodwaters referring to a simple instability model fig 2 the forces acting on a human body are milanesi et al 2015 wang and marsooli 2021 xia et al 2014a 4 d r a g d 1 2 ρ c d w y u 2 l i f t l 1 2 ρ c l w y u 2 weight g ρ p g h p w b buoyancy b ρ g y w b where ρ and ρ p are the water and body densities cd and cl are the drag and lift coefficients hp the body height measured at shoulders w the frontal body width and b the average length of the body in the flow direction instability may occur by toppling or sliding mechanisms depending on the froude number arrighi et al 2017 here we focus on sliding instability typical of lower depths and higher flow velocities but similar reasoning applies to toppling mechanism the critical stability condition for sliding is 5 d g b l μ where μ is the friction coefficient using eqs 4 and solving eq 5 for the squared velocity we obtain 6 u 2 2 g b μ c d μ c l h p y 1 the w 1 isoline for people is easily obtained from eq 3 to read 7 u 2 gy β y w y α 1 comparing eqs 6 and 7 we find α 2 and yw hp in fact with these parameters eq 7 can be rewritten as 8 u 2 gy β h p y 2 1 gy β h p y 1 h p y 1 g h p y β h p y 1 combining eqs 6 and 8 to eliminate u 2 we find 9 β c d μ c l 2 μ h p y b the parameter β which multiplies the froude number in eq 3 controls the relative importance of the dynamic component of w it plays a role when the froude number is relatively high and becomes irrelevant in the limit f 0 accordingly a significant estimate of β can be obtained in the limit f which corresponds to y 0 in this case eq 9 provides 10 β c d μ c l 2 b μ h p considering a drag coefficient cd in the range 1 0 1 2 a lift coefficient cl 0 a friction coefficient μ in the range 0 3 0 5 and the lengths b 0 25 0 35 m and hp 1 20 1 50 m the calibration factor β varies in the range 3 0 7 0 for adults then the best values of yw and β can be found based on available experimental data indeed many theoretical and experimental studies are available in the technical literature concerning the stability of people in floodwaters the variety of data obtained from different experiments does not represent real flooding conditions yet it allows for a robust evaluation of the limiting condition for the stability of people exposed to floodwaters fig 3 collects data from the studies by foster and cox 1973 abt et al 1989 takahashi et al 1992 karvonen et al 2000 yee 2003 jonkman and penning rowsell 2008 russo et al 2013 xia et al 2014a milanesi et al 2015 chanson and brown 2015 2018 martínez gomariz et al 2016 milanesi et al 2016 and arrighi et al 2017 such data can be considered sufficiently homogeneous and representative of different sub categories of individuals at the same time as they all refer to loss of stability in a variety of physical and boundary conditions and at the first attempt i e when the person exposed to the flow does not have any experience the latter condition is the reason why the dataset from abt et al 1989 although reported in the figure is not accounted for in assessing the curves in fact the purpose of the experiments performed by abt et al 1989 was to identify the absolute limit of stability of people that being tested several times in similar conditions learned how to cope with floodwaters we choose the isoline w 1 to represent the upper limit of the off events detected in all the experimental data of fig 3 i e wlim 1 identifies the critical condition for the most resistant items in the whole category by adjusting the model parameters we find yw 1 25 m α 2 0 and β 4 0 which corresponds to the black iso w line in fig 3 it is worth observing that with these values of α and β the impact parameter w identifies momentum as the main damage determinant in line with the underlying physical processes i e dragging the upper limit in fig 3 as well as the values chosen for yw α β are dictated by the resistance of the adult sub category as previously noted the vulnerability of sub categories should be characterized by lower values of the impact parameter yet with the same parameter structure i e by keeping yw α and β fixed the critical threshold wk lim for the k th sub category is then a fraction of the critical impact parameter of the reference most resistant sub category wlim according to 11 w k lim w lim y w k y w α the above relation see appendix a means that the critical value for the k th sub category wk lim depends only on the physical parameters describing the k th sub category i e on ywk and it is independent of hydrodynamics fig 3 shows that the limit condition for children younger than 18 years old is well described by the w wk lim 0 35 isoline green line 3 1 2 relative damage functions the second step consists in assessing the relative damage functions according to the method outlined in sect 2 2 a sufficiently large and representative sample of off conditions should be considered for the case of people stability a rich experimental dataset is available fig 3 from each pair ui yi of the off events the associated value of wi is computed using eq 3 the cumulative frequency distribution of wi for the two sub categories plotted in fig 4 a gives the relative damage curve i e the probability to fail for each single individual belonging to a given sub category it is often convenient to interpolate the discrete cumulative distributions inferred from the data with a continuous function to express the relative damage among the possible forms a simple and effective expression is 12 rd w 1 1 a w b fig 4a compares the relative damage functions obtained for the two sub categories note that this is possible only because the hydrodynamic hazard is described by the same impact parameter for the case of people a good fit of the discrete data is found using eq 12 with a 0 25 and b 6 for children green line in fig 4 and a 0 6 and b 5 0 for adults black line in fig 4 thanks to the use of a single impact parameter to describe the hydrodynamic hazard for different sub categories the corresponding relative damage functions can be combined to provide a unique function for the whole category as a weighted average of the sub category relative damage functions 13 r d w j 1 n φ j r d j w where n is the number of sub categories φj is the percentage of objects belonging to the j th sub category and rdj w is the associated relative damage curve for example one can easily derive the relative damage functions for population living in countries with different distribution of children and adults e g the proportion of children is larger in asian than in european countries or for people that typically frequent different districts of a city e g the fraction of children is different in industrial and school areas making school areas more vulnerable an example is shown in fig 4b where starting from the relative damage functions for adults and children green and black lines we compute the relative damage functions for the italian population orange line considering 16 of children and 84 of adults according to istat 2020 for an industrial area assuming 5 of children and 95 of adults blue line and for a school area assuming 80 of children and 20 of adults light green line 3 1 3 comparison with previous approaches comparing the proposed approach with previous ones provides some interesting insights indeed some formulations have been previously proposed both in the scientific literature and in flood risk manuals to express flood damage for people in terms of a single hazard parameter which combines flow depth and velocity e g aidr 2017 bww brp buwal 2008 cox et al 2010 de moel et al 2009 ramsbottom et al 2006 smith et al 2014 in these works damage is classified with the use of thresholds that provide qualitative descriptions of vulnerability rather than quantitative measure of the expected damage unfortunately the use of dimensional parameters and of thresholds that are based on empirical evidence led to damage definitions lacking a clear meaning or with a weak physical constitution the significant discrepancies among the degree of damage predicted by different formulations as detailed in the following are signs of these weaknesses for example ramsbottom et al 2006 introduced the hazard rating index hr y u 0 5 and defined four ranges of hr corresponding to four qualitative probabilities of damage low hr 0 75 moderate 0 75 hr 1 25 significant 1 25 hr 2 5 and extreme hr 2 5 cox et al 2010 used the product number pn u y to identify the same four classes of damage probability thresholds for pn are 0 6 0 8 and 1 2 m2 s with additional conditions entailing the extreme damage probability when either u 3 0 m s for both adults and children y 1 2 m for adults or y 0 5 m for children in order to compare the two above classifications we compute the values of hr and pn for pairs u y in the range 0 u 5 m s and 0 y 2 5 m and check for the agreement between the associated risk classes the results are reported in fig 5 a for adults and in fig 5b children shaded areas denote the domain of all possible pn and hr the grey and the coloured areas mark agreement and disagreement between the two approaches respectively consider two examples of the damage probability for adults the couple u 3 m s y 0 2 m leads to hr 0 7 and to pn 0 6 both corresponding to the low class the two criteria agree this point falls in the grey area of fig 5a on the other hand the couple u 3 1 m s y 0 2 m leads to hr 0 74 low and to pn 0 64 extreme because of u 3 m s i e the probability of damage is three classes higher using pn rather than hr this point falls in the dark red area in fig 5a for the children sub category the classes of damage are three moderate and significant are merged by looking at fig 5b for children there are hazard conditions corresponding to moderate significant damage using hr and to extreme using pn large yellow area and even worse low damage probability using hr and extreme using pn orange area a partial reason for the above differences could be found in the use of the abt et al 1989 dataset to determine the hr thresholds ramsbottom et al 2006 the lack of a proper physical base of the above criteria likely played a role as well a comparison of the impact parameter w with the hr and pn criteria for assessing damage probability of adults black lines and symbols and children green lines and symbols is shown in fig 6 the isolines corresponding to extreme conditions according to the different criteria are superposed to the experimental data as observed the iso hr lines tend to overestimate the actual stability conditions whereas the iso pn lines fit the experimental data very well for flow velocities between 1 and 3 m s yet for the lowest and highest velocities the iso hr and iso pn lines are not physically sound for example when u 0 m s the hr approach predicts extreme conditions only for a water depth y 5 m which is a very large value in real flooding events indeed for the case u 0 the extreme limit hr 2 5 corresponds to y 5 m kvocka et al 2016 the pn approach excludes unrealistic results thanks to additional thresholds horizontal and vertical dashed segments in fig 6b nonetheless the upper limit of u 3 m s seems too much clear cut since some experimental data lay well beyond interestingly the iso w lines with suitable calibration factors well envelope the available experimental data and are consistent with the common sense as well 3 2 stability of vehicles in floodwaters a second application of the method to on off damaging processes involving vehicles is shortly presented as for the case of people instability of vehicles in floodwaters occurs due to a sliding mechanism caused by drag the physical problem is slightly complicated for the presence of the gap between the car and the ground martínez gomariz et al 2018 milanesi and pilotti 2019 xia et al 2011 and uncertainty about watertightness of vehicles bocanegra et al 2020 many studies in the technical literature relate the on off damaging condition of vehicles in flowing water to the in stability condition of the vehicle fig 7 collects data from bonham and hattersley 1967 gordon and stone 1973 keller and mitsch 1993 kramer et al 2016 martínez gomariz et al 2018 martínez gomariz et al 2019 milanesi and pilotti 2019 oshikawa et al 2011 shand et al 2011 shu et al 2011 smith et al 2019 teo et al 2012 toda et al 2013 xia et al 2011 xia et al 2014b within the vehicle category we consider three different sub categories small to medium cars medium to large cars suvs and vans the last one is taken as the reference category since it is the most resistant here to determine the calibration factors of w it is more convenient to adopt a data driven procedure which considers the physics of the problem as well since the instability is drag driven a reasonable choice for the parameter α is2 so that the static contribution to w corresponds to the hydrostatic force to fit the upper limit of stability of available data with a w 1 iso line suitable values of the model parameters are yw 0 9 m and β 0 6 these values correspond to the most resistant vans and suvs the limit stability conditions for the weaker sub categories are well described using the same values of yw α and β by isolines characterized by lower values of w specifically w 0 50 for medium to large and w 0 35 for small to medium vehicles fig 7 the fact that the same structure of the impact parameter w allows to describing the limit conditions of different sub categories confirms that the physics based and flexible structure of w well captures the key aspects of the damaging process of items within a given category the cumulative frequency distributions for each sub category fig 8 are evaluated using the data of fig 7 and are interpolated with continuous relative damage functions using eq 12 3 3 damage of buildings the procedure for assessing the vulnerability of objects subject to progressive damage is slightly different from that of on off damage processes to show this we use damage to residential buildings as an example experimental data on damage to buildings are scarce in the literature often refer to on off damage processes i e the collapse of buildings and are unsuitable for the objective of the analysis as they usually express damage in absolute terms rarely report information about flood velocity and do not contain enough information on building characteristics hampering their classification in classes of similar resistance for these reasons we base our analysis on relative damage data rd provided by the synthetic damage model insyde dottori et al 2016 molinari scorzini 2017 insyde is a synthetic probabilistic flood damage model based on a component by component explicit cost analysis and it is especially appropriate for our aim as it considers the role of many hazard variables in shaping damage including water depth and flow velocity as well as the main characteristics of buildings that determine their propensity to be damaged in similar ways here we consider residential buildings with standard italian features and geometry the variables building structure and number of floors are allowed to vary forming four sub categories of buildings i e reinforced concrete or masonry buildings with 1 or 2 floors the flood duration is assumed constant i e 6 h whereas sediment and contaminant loads are neglected in order to evaluate only the dependence of damage on water depth and velocity in detail for each sub category the insyde model is forced with a set of u y input data to generate a set of u y rd the first step for the definition of the damage model is determining the structure of the impact parameter w i e finding suitable values of yw α and β recalling the link between iso w and iso rd lines in the u y plane sect 2 2 the set of u y rd triplets provided by the insyde model allows identifying iso rd lines in the u y plane which makes the procedure more robust than for on off damage processes since rd 100 points in the u y plane are generally not available for objects subject to progressive damage total damage entails extreme thus rare forcing conditions matching the rd 1 limit condition with w 1 isolines makes little to no sense a sensible choice must be done to define for each sub category the value of rd associated to w 1 this value becomes a sort of reference relative damage and differently from the case of on off data values of w 1 can be expected for high hazard conditions we then set yw equal to the physically meaningful threshold yw 3 5 m which corresponds to the typical height of the first floor in italy of course choosing yw equal to the first floor height is just one of the possible choices proper values of the α and β factors can then be found by making the shape of iso w and iso rd lines as similar to each other as possible in doing so the analysis of the damage mechanisms can be of further support for the case under investigation physical reasoning suggests choosing α 1 as damage to buildings is mainly due to wetting which depends on water depth and flow energy rather than on flow force gems et al 2016 moreover for u 0 the impact parameter w reduces to a non dimensional measure of the water depth y scaled with the first floor height the best fit of data provided by insyde then leads to a suitable value of β fig 9 a displays the results obtained for the case of two storey masonry buildings for this sub category we obtain β 0 3 a relatively low value that confirms the marginal role of flow velocity and locates the structure of w between water depth and specific energy leelawat et al 2014 kreibich et al 2009 scorzini and frank 2017 looking at fig 9a where the different symbols represent rd const conditions the dependence of rd on the flow velocity u seems not well captured by iso w lines the reasons are manifold the flow velocity naturally plays a minor role in building damaging than for items subject to instability furthermore the insyde model contains simplifications and idealizations that include the linearization of processes and the use of internal thresholds e g the value of u becomes irrelevant from 2 3 to 5 m s associating iso w and iso rd lines provides couples of rd w for each sub category the interpolation of these points with a monotonically increasing relationship such as eq 12 gives the relative damage function fig 9b as for the previous cases the relative damage functions for different kinds of buildings can be compared on the same plot this is because hazard conditions are described by a structure of the impact parameter w that is shared by all the sub categories here considered in order to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed procedure based on the impact parameter w we generate random values for u y pairs with 0 u 5 m s and 0 y 5 m then for the two storey masonry building sub category we compute the corresponding values of relative damage using the insyde model and compare the results with the corresponding relative damage values provided by the relative damage functions of fig 9b the comparison reported in fig 10 shows a good agreement with a correlation coefficient r2 0 95 4 discussion the idea of combining water depth and flow velocity to express flood hazard is not new functional relations involving flow depth and velocity or equivalently the froude number are the typical outcome of physics based studies for flood loss of people and vehicles e g arrighi et al 2015 2017 jonkman and penning rowsell 2008 lind et al 2004 martínez gomariz et al 2016 2019 milanesi and pilotti 2019 milanesi et al 2015 postacchini et al 2021 shu et al 2011 smith et al 2019 xia et al 2014a xia et al 2014b aureli et al 2008 introduced the total depth d y 1 2 f 2 which includes the effect of flow inertia and represents the water depth at rest whose static force is equivalent to the total force of the flow combined with the outcomes of hydrodynamic models ferrari et al 2019 ferrari et al 2020 the total depth provides a spatially distributed picture of the hazard degree that is particularly significant for items subject to dragging i e when loss is a matter of forces kreibich et al 2009 explored the dependence of flood damage on different parameters involving flow depth and velocity concluding that the choice of the best parameter s depends on the kind of items considered among these parameters the product of flow depth and velocity y u known as flow intensity kreibich et al 2009 product number cox et al 2010 or flow magnitude arrighi et al 2020 found widespread applications in the loss assessment of people and vehicle in floodwaters e g aidr 2017 costabile et al 2020 a quite similar index is the hazard rating hr y u 0 5 introduced by ramsbottom et al 2006 and commented in previous section 3 1 3 as an important aspect many of the above impact parameters need to be complemented by specific thresholds which apply to basic quantities a notable example is the y u product number which does not represent any physically relevant principle and requires thresholds on both water depth and velocity to provide a measure of the risk degree in general conditions aidr 2017 cox et al 2010 the multifaceted picture of functional relations and impact parameters cited above suggests i the need for specific impact parameters to capture the damage processes of different kind of exposed items ii the fragmentation of approaches methods and outcomes deriving from a wealth of valuable studies dealing with specific object categories with a lack of common vision iii some inconsistencies that are the unavoidable consequence of fragmentation or insufficient physical foundation of which the extensive use of thresholds is a symptom these three factors act to limit the general applicability of previous methods and in some cases their robustness as well while the first factor is intrinsic of the problem the last ones deserve further attention the method we propose is a step to overcome these drawbacks as the impact parameter w is non dimensional thus expressing a degree of hazard independent of specific dimensions if opportunely scaled it provides an immediate measure of the hazard degree also when hazard is determined by particular combinations of both water depth and flow velocity this allows for an enhanced comprehension of damage causes and processes the impact parameter w is flexible hence capable of representing various damage mechanisms within a common frame as shown in the above applications this allows encompassing and complementing previous works on flood vulnerability which included water depth and velocity as explanatory variables indeed previous studies and analysis can be recast in a general common framework that allows obtaining elegant single variable relative damage curves for item categories subject to either progressive or on off damage the impact parameter w has a physical foundation as it ranges between the concept of energy and momentum and it can be fitted to available experimental and field data effectively without the need of additional thresholds this is expected to enhance the robustness of damage predictions also with respect to high dimensional multi variate models that can be ill conditioned in case of scarce data carisi et al 2018 merz et al 2013 wang et al 2015 the applications shown in section 3 proved that a given structure of the w parameter i e a couple of parameters α and β allows capturing the mechanisms of damage for categories of objects that share the same nature e g people vehicles etc and are exposed to the same damage process thus a single structure of w can be used to express the hazard degree of different sub categories that group objects characterized by different resistance this allows comparing the vulnerability of different items belonging to the same category and to express the vulnerability of a category depending on its composition by weight averaging the relative damage functions of sub categories this is particularly useful for comparing different vulnerability contexts and facilitates the evaluation of absolute or total damage when exposure is the same for different sub categories in other words the use of w allows expressing the hazard degree as a function of a single parameter thus enhancing the intelligibility of hazard information and simplifying damage assessment another remark regards the vulnerability of buildings we applied the proposed procedure considering the progressive damage caused by wetting which is the most challenging application because of the structure of the impact parameter w and of the marginal role played by flow velocity this choice was aimed at testing the flexibility of w better results are expected from the application of w to the case of building stability which can be undermined as a result of flow drag and buoyancy black 1975 mazzorana et al 2014 the physics of the problem shares fundamental similarities with the loss of stability of people and vehicles in floodwaters indeed the shape of stability thresholds for buildings dale et al 2004 middelmann fernandes 2010 bignami et al 2019 is very similar to the w isolines obtained in sect 3 1 and 3 2 a common aspect that can be observed in many studies on flood risk for on off items is the lack of fragility curves describing the actually gradual variation of the loss probability with the hazard degree in some cases the assessment is limited to hazard degree thresholds e g middelmann fernandes 2010 often the probability of loss is expressed by means of classes e g cox et al 2010 kvocka et al 2016 ramsbottom et al 2006 which makes difficult to obtain quantitative results e g expected losses moreover the identification of these classes is based on empirical considerations in other cases flood hazard rating is assumed to vary linearly with the ratio of the actual flow velocity to the incipient velocity i e the velocity at which person loses stability in floodwater kvocka et al 2016 but the real correspondence between hazard rating and fragility remains unknown the method we proposed to derive fragility curves section 2 2 allows expressing the loss probability explicitly it is based on the knowledge of a set of loss conditions derived either from experimental field data or from physics based models forced with a representative set of input data e g for varying the characteristics of exposed items a future development regards the inclusion of other variables within the impact parameter an example is the wind velocity that can contribute to human s vulnerability as demonstrated in the recent study on storm induced coastal flooding by wang and marsooli 2021 another important aspect that needs to be considered is the forcing duration which in fact deserves a particular attention damaging develops in time and the rate at which damage develops depends on the time variation of the forcing factors on one hand hydrodynamic models able to provide a spatially explicit detailed and accurate temporal evolution of water depth and flow velocity in flooded areas at local and regional scales are now largely available e g ferrari et al 2019 ferrari viero 2020 lacasta et al 2014 sanders schubert 2019 on the other hand expressing the hazard degree with a single impact parameter is beneficial to describe time dependence of the damage 5 conclusions in the present study a procedure is outlined to assess flood relative damage functions based on one single impact parameter describing the hydrodynamic action the proposed impact parameter w has a physics based flexible form that allows estimating the flood hazard degree for items subject to diverse damaging processes it is particularly useful when both water depth and flow velocity play a role in the damage process the application of the proposed impact parameter to assess the vulnerability to floods of people vehicles and residential buildings confirmed the flexibility of the formulation and showed advantages of using a physics based explicit approach relative damage functions are assessed through a data driven procedure which is based on the use of either real data both synthetic or experimental bearing sufficient information on flood features i e hazard degree and the damage to exposed items after determining a suitable structure of the impact parameter w the relative damage functions are assessed in a probabilistic framework for on off damage process like those related to the stability of people or vehicles in flowing water and with a deterministic fitting procedure for progressive damage processes yet the relative damage functions obtained through the two approaches are equivalent for practical application purposes adopting the impact parameter w traditional depth damage functions and fragility curves are enhanced by including the flow velocity as hazard determinant and multi variable damage functions are reverted to simpler and more elegant single variable non dimensional functions previous damage and loss models can be recast in a unique simple and elegant form the flexibility of the present formulation also allows for an easy merging of physics based reasoning and available data which can result in enhanced model robustness credit authorship

impact parameters for different sub categories here we derive in terms of impact parameter w the limit condition of full loss for different sub categories of exposed items without loss of generality let us consider two sub categories and start looking at each sub category as a single category for the most resistant category denoted as reference category eq 3 defines the impact parameter for given yw α and β 14 w y y w α 1 β f 2 the full loss of items in the reference category is denoted by the limit condition w wlim for simplicity this limit can be thought as wlim 1 for the k th weaker sub category taken individually the impact parameter is 15 w k y y w k α 1 β f 2 y w y w k α y y w α 1 β f 2 y w y w k α w in eq 15 the parameters α and β remain the same as in eq 14 as the physics of damage process is the same for the whole category again ywk is chosen to identify the sub category limit condition of full loss as w k wlim in this way for a given flow condition y f the resulting impact parameter is different for each sub category in particular larger values are obtained for weaker sub categories i e w k w since ywk is smaller than yw this occurrence is indeed annoying for example it prevents plotting iso w lines of different sub categories onto the same y u plane it is far more convenient to have a biunivocal correspondence between w and the flow conditions y f for an entire category of similar exposed items this is achieved by rescaling the impact parameter of weaker sub categories w k by a factor ywk yw α which corresponds to using a single reference depth namely yw for the whole category the limit condition associated to the k th sub category denoted with wk lim is rescaled accordingly 16 w k lim y w k y w α w lim as a final result for a given flow condition y f the impact parameter w is the same for different sub categories for items belonging to the k th sub category the hazard degree is then expressed by the ratio w wk lim 
3542,direct flood damage is commonly assessed using damage models i e vulnerability functions and fragility curves which describe the relationship between hazard vulnerability and the probability of damage for items exposed to floods in this paper we introduce a non dimensional impact parameter that according to the physics of damage mechanisms and or tuned on field or lab data combines water depth and flow velocity in a general and flexible form we then suggest a general approach to assess relative damage functions for items of different nature subject to either progressive or on off damage processes the proposed method enhances traditional tools that use inundation depth as the main or only explicative variable and allows recasting the results from previous studies in an elegant flexible and unique form compared to multivariate models that link flow variables to damage directly the physics based approach allows for an intelligible assessment of flood hazard and the associated damage even in case of scarce or sparse data the proposed impact parameter and the related procedure to assess the relative damage functions are applied to different kinds of exposed items people vehicles and buildings demonstrating the general applicability and validity of the proposed method keywords damage flood hazard vulnerability vulnerability function flood risk 1 introduction flood damage assessment is a fundamental step and a key information basis in any deliberation on flood risk management being it related to long term mitigation measures or to the emergency phase see e g the european floods directive two kinds of tools are generally used to assess direct flood damage pregnolato et al 2015 fuchs et al 2019a the standard tool is represented by vulnerability curves relating hazard exposure and vulnerability to the damage usually expressed in relative terms on a scale ranging from 0 no damage to 1 total loss amadio et al 2019 dutta et al 2003 fuchs et al 2019b gerl et al 2016 krzysztofowicz and davis 1983 merz et al 2013 smith 1994 this tool is appropriate for the description of damage mechanisms and processes that allow for intermediate states of damage i e between zero and the total loss like damage to buildings crops etc these processes are referred to as progressive processes in the following in contrast to vulnerability curves fragility curves express the relationship between hazard vulnerability and the probability of having a certain damage e g haugen kaynia 2008 mcgrath et al 2019 nofal et al 2020 papathoma köhle et al 2017 pita et al 2021 thapa et al 2020 hence they are profitably used to describe binary processes in which only two states are possible i e fully safe on event or fully damaged off event and the damaging occurs very quickly hereinafter we define these processes as on off processes whose typical examples are people or vehicles in floodwater both vulnerability and fragility functions share the use of inundation depth as the main explicative variable for flood damage apel et al 2004 chen et al 2019 de moel et al 2015 gerl et al 2016 jamali et al 2018 hasanzadeh nafari et al 2017 huizinga et al 2017 jongman et al 2012 kreibich et al 2009 lv et al 2021 martínez gomariz et al 2021 zhou et al 2012 although it is widely accepted that flood damage is mainly influenced by water depth this parameter cannot fully explain damage data variance which instead can be explained by a variety of parameters related both to hazard and to vulnerability chen et al 2016 dang et al 2011 kreibich et al 2017 mcbean et al 1988 merz et al 2004 2010 molinari et al 2014 2019 pham et al 2020 thieken et al 2005 thieken et al 2008 with the latter being strongly dependent on and varying with the object under investigation and the physical and socio economic context in which the flood occurs menoni et al 2012 nonetheless vulnerability parameters are often related to socio economic aspects that can be hardly quantified koks et al 2015 and for which only a qualitative evaluation is possible like the experience of affected people their level of education the level of maintenance of a building menoni et al 2012 this makes the generalization of flood damage assessment tools as well as their adaptability and transferability in space and time a challenging task cammerer et al 2013 molinari et al 2019 molinari et al 2020 however the relationship between damage and hazard variables is more prone to generalization than that with vulnerability s as it mainly involves physical processes that can be quantified and modelled in mathematical terms in fact several studies propose qualitative fragility curves e g by expressing the probability of damage as low moderate and high as a function of different combinations of water depth and flow velocity for a variety of objects see e g cox et al 2010 penning rowsell et al 2005 ramsbottom et al 2006 limiting the analysis to direct flood damage this paper presents a general and flexible method to assess the relative damage for progressive and on off damage processes using a common framework the two main ingredients are i a new impact parameter w which allows to measure flood hazard accounting for both inundation depth and water velocity as flood damage determinants and ii a procedure to derive the relative damage as a function of w quantitatively starting from physical considerations empirical or synthetic damage data the goal is extending the traditional depth damage approach accounting for additional explicative variables as flow velocity yet retaining a relatively simple and intelligible structure an explicit physics based modelling approach is preferred because physics based damage models may provide robust results in different contexts and in novel conditions with scarce calibration data and allow modellers to improve their knowledge and to keep control on the entire process of damage assessment these aspects are valuable even in the era of big data and complex multi variate data based models whose reliability essentially depends on the quantity and quality of training data carisi et al 2018 gumiere et al 2020 merz et al 2013 molinari et al 2020 mosavi et al 2018 van ootegem et al 2015 van ootegem et al 2018 the paper is organized as follows section2 describes the proposed procedure by first introducing the impact parameter w section2 1 and then explaining how the parameter can be related to the damage degree or the probability of damage section2 2 section3 provides some practical examples on the use of the impact parameter w and on the method to derive damage models and fragility functions some comparisons with previous approaches are also shown finally section4 discusses the work and makes final remarks 2 an approach for the definition of relative damage functions before going into the details of how the impact parameter w is defined and can be used some aspects deserve clarifications for the sake of simplicity in the following we use the term relative damage functions to denote both vulnerability functions and fragility curves cardona 2004 cardona et al 2012 thywissen 2006 indeed the definition of total damage for progressive damage processes and of total loss for on off processes are very similar to each other total damage relative damage total value of exposed items total loss loss probability total number of exposed items the loss probability as the relative damage varies between 0 and 1 and increases with the hazard increasing which supports the general use of relative damage in both the cases accordingly relative damage functions can be viewed either in a deterministic sense for progressive damage processes or in a probabilistic sense for on off events depending on the nature of items exposed to floods and on flood features damage can be ascribed to many diverse processes e g wetting dragging drowning which in turn depend on different explanatory variables such as water depth and velocity flood duration contaminant load socio economic status and precautionary measures apel et al 2009 bignami et al 2019 carisi et al 2018 ettinger et al 2016 karagiorgos et al 2016 kok et al 2005 merz et al 2010 mignot et al 2019 schröter et al 2014 accordingly damage functions are typically highly multidimensional thus hard to be assessed in a comprehensible and compact form papathoma köhle et al 2019 we restrict the analysis to the direct flood damage driven by mechanical processes in this case the free variables of relative damage functions reduce to water depth and flow velocity balica et al 2013 black 1975 clausen and clark 1990 de risi et al 2013 gallegos et al 2012 hammond et al 2015 jongman et al 2012 martínez gomariz et al 2021 nadal et al 2010 postacchini et al 2019 roos et al 2003 zhou et al 2012 the importance of water velocity in shaping damage has been demonstrated especially for flash floods with respect to different damage processes such as physical damage to roads and buildings stability of people and vehicles structural damage to buildings see e g arrighi et al 2015 garrote et al 2016 kellermann et al 2015 kelman and spence 2004 kreibich et al 2009 maiwald and schwarz 2015 martínez gomariz et al 2018 mcbean et al 1988 milanesi et al 2018 postacchini et al 2021 therefore the development of models that include water velocity as an input parameter is expected to reduce flood damage variance with respect to the widely used depth damage curves e g pistrika and jonkman 2009 de moel and aerts 2011 2 1 a lumped impact parameter for measuring the flood hazard we combine the water depth y and flow velocity u into a single lumped parameter named w so as to express the relative damage as a univariate function rd rd w the parameter w is then meant to measure the intensity of the hydrodynamic conditions that effectively produces the damage aureli et al 2008 the way in which y and u combine to form w depends on the kind of exposed items and on the damage process under investigation therefore the impact parameter w is expected to assume a form that is object and process dependent from a deterministic point of view common parameters that combine flow depth and velocity are flow energy per unit weight h and momentum per unit width and weight m 1 h y u 2 2 g y 1 1 2 f 2 2 m y 2 2 u 2 y g y 2 2 1 2 f 2 where g is gravity and f u g y 1 2 the froude number noting the similarity between these two expressions we propose to use a general impact parameter w in the form 3 w y y w α 1 β f 2 with y w 0 α 1 β 0 in which yw is a reference depth that scales the actual water depth y and α and β are two calibration factors that measure the relative importance of the static versus the dynamic component of w through a proper choice of the two calibration factors w can express the physically relevant concepts of water depth y with α 1 and β 0 of flow energy h with α 1 and β 0 5 and of momentum m with α 2 and β 2 thereby α and β change the nature of w among depth energy and force momentum the key idea is that with suitable calibration factors α and β iso w lines in the u y plane can identify different flow conditions that are equivalent in terms of damaging potential for specific categories of objects and processes the goal can be achieved as the structure of w is able to resemble the physics of the damage process advantages of using the impact parameter w include w is non dimensional it increases monotonically with the damage and can be arbitrarily scaled through a proper choice of the reference depth yw for example w can conveniently range from 0 to 1 the use of w reduces the dimensionality of the problem and allows for an immediate and intuitive assessment of the hazard degree in addition the use of a lumped parameter for identifying the hazard intensity makes the relative damage functions simpler non dimensional and more elegant how the calibration parameters α and β affect the meaning of w is shown in panels a c of fig 1 where for yw 1 m three isolines for w 0 1 w 0 5 and w 1 are plotted in the u y plane fig 1a β 1 shows that by increasing α the static part of w plays a more important role the isolines reduce their slope and the impact of velocity is lower fig 1a shows that iso w lines move upwards with increasing α as a general rule α 1 makes w a good indicator when damage is essentially produced by wetting i e water depth or energy are most involved whereas α 2 is best suited when damage or loss are mainly produced by dragging i e static and dynamic forces are most involved fig 1b α 1 and fig 1c α 2 show that increasing values of β correspond to an increasing role of flow velocity since iso w lines become steeper whereas β 0 reduces w to a static parameter depending only on the water depth the calibration factors of w can be assessed by developing physical models of the damaging process and by analysing critical damaging conditions a further fine tuning of model parameters might stem from the comparison with available field or lab data here we present a brief overview of the approach details on the method and data are given in section 3 let s consider for example the case of people and vehicles exposed to flood flow both these categories of objects are subject to dragging which is a matter of forces this suggests choosing α 2 as for the momentum equation 2 kvocka et al 2016 physics based models as those by arrighi et al 2015 arrighi et al 2017 milanesi et al 2015 and milanesi and pilotti 2019 provide instability conditions that can be represented by w 1 iso lines leading to yw 1 25 m α 2 0 β 4 0 for people and yw 0 9 m α 2 0 β 0 6 for vehicles fig 1d shows in the u y plane extreme hazard conditions for people black dots and vehicles green dots exposed to floods corresponding to the stability loss the arrangement of dots clearly shows that limit conditions exist in terms of maximum resistance to flood for both people and vehicles these limit conditions correspond to relatively large water depths when the flow velocity is low and to relatively shallow water depths when the flow velocity is large in the same fig 1d the w 1 isolines described above black and green lines for people and vehicles respectively envelop well the available experimental data confirming the proper parameterization this simple example shows the capability of the impact parameter w of describing extreme hazard conditions of items that behave quite differently from one another the very different values of β needed to fit the experimental data prove the different role played by water depth and flow velocity for people and vehicles quantitatively providing useful insights for risk management 2 2 the method to derive relative damage functions once the hazard conditions are assessed through the lumped impact parameter w the second point is relating w to the damage in other words continuous functions providing the relative damage or the probability of off events should be determined for any value of w the method to construct the relative damage functions is based on the correspondence between iso w and iso rd lines this correspondence descends from the fact that rd rd w is a univariate function for progressive damage processes the structure of the impact parameter w is determined to make iso w lines matching the shape of iso rd lines then a set of couples w rd is easily found for on off processes the tuning of w is based on the knowledge of hazard conditions related to off events which corresponds to rd 1 conditions the relative damage is then given by the cumulative frequency distributions cfd of w associated to the off events finally w rd couples or discrete cfds can be suitably approximated to provide the relative damage functions 3 applications in the present section the lumped impact parameter w and the procedure to construct the relative damage functions are applied to three cases of practical interest given that the definition of relative damage and its assessment slightly differ when considering on off or progressive damage processes we analyse the stability of people and vehicles for the first type of process and the damaging of buildings for the second one these applications are only aimed at describing the use of the impact parameter w and the method to assess relative damage functions showing both the advantages and the limitations of the proposed approach 3 1 stability of people in floodwaters 3 1 1 impact parameter w vulnerability of people due to stability loss in flowing water can be seen as an on off process the resistance of people to flowing water depends on different aspects such as age sex weight height and experience lind et al 2004 this suggests that different relative damage functions can be defined according to the sub categories of people considered however as long as the impact parameter w is able to capture the physical mechanisms of damage which is the same for any individual a unique structure of w given by a set yw α β can be defined for the whole population see appendix a relative damage functions for sub categories can then be defined by considering different values for the impact parameter here for simplicity we consider only two broad sub categories namely adults and children assuming the loss of balance as full damage condition the calibration factors of w are estimated starting from a physical point of view considering the stability of a human body in floodwaters referring to a simple instability model fig 2 the forces acting on a human body are milanesi et al 2015 wang and marsooli 2021 xia et al 2014a 4 d r a g d 1 2 ρ c d w y u 2 l i f t l 1 2 ρ c l w y u 2 weight g ρ p g h p w b buoyancy b ρ g y w b where ρ and ρ p are the water and body densities cd and cl are the drag and lift coefficients hp the body height measured at shoulders w the frontal body width and b the average length of the body in the flow direction instability may occur by toppling or sliding mechanisms depending on the froude number arrighi et al 2017 here we focus on sliding instability typical of lower depths and higher flow velocities but similar reasoning applies to toppling mechanism the critical stability condition for sliding is 5 d g b l μ where μ is the friction coefficient using eqs 4 and solving eq 5 for the squared velocity we obtain 6 u 2 2 g b μ c d μ c l h p y 1 the w 1 isoline for people is easily obtained from eq 3 to read 7 u 2 gy β y w y α 1 comparing eqs 6 and 7 we find α 2 and yw hp in fact with these parameters eq 7 can be rewritten as 8 u 2 gy β h p y 2 1 gy β h p y 1 h p y 1 g h p y β h p y 1 combining eqs 6 and 8 to eliminate u 2 we find 9 β c d μ c l 2 μ h p y b the parameter β which multiplies the froude number in eq 3 controls the relative importance of the dynamic component of w it plays a role when the froude number is relatively high and becomes irrelevant in the limit f 0 accordingly a significant estimate of β can be obtained in the limit f which corresponds to y 0 in this case eq 9 provides 10 β c d μ c l 2 b μ h p considering a drag coefficient cd in the range 1 0 1 2 a lift coefficient cl 0 a friction coefficient μ in the range 0 3 0 5 and the lengths b 0 25 0 35 m and hp 1 20 1 50 m the calibration factor β varies in the range 3 0 7 0 for adults then the best values of yw and β can be found based on available experimental data indeed many theoretical and experimental studies are available in the technical literature concerning the stability of people in floodwaters the variety of data obtained from different experiments does not represent real flooding conditions yet it allows for a robust evaluation of the limiting condition for the stability of people exposed to floodwaters fig 3 collects data from the studies by foster and cox 1973 abt et al 1989 takahashi et al 1992 karvonen et al 2000 yee 2003 jonkman and penning rowsell 2008 russo et al 2013 xia et al 2014a milanesi et al 2015 chanson and brown 2015 2018 martínez gomariz et al 2016 milanesi et al 2016 and arrighi et al 2017 such data can be considered sufficiently homogeneous and representative of different sub categories of individuals at the same time as they all refer to loss of stability in a variety of physical and boundary conditions and at the first attempt i e when the person exposed to the flow does not have any experience the latter condition is the reason why the dataset from abt et al 1989 although reported in the figure is not accounted for in assessing the curves in fact the purpose of the experiments performed by abt et al 1989 was to identify the absolute limit of stability of people that being tested several times in similar conditions learned how to cope with floodwaters we choose the isoline w 1 to represent the upper limit of the off events detected in all the experimental data of fig 3 i e wlim 1 identifies the critical condition for the most resistant items in the whole category by adjusting the model parameters we find yw 1 25 m α 2 0 and β 4 0 which corresponds to the black iso w line in fig 3 it is worth observing that with these values of α and β the impact parameter w identifies momentum as the main damage determinant in line with the underlying physical processes i e dragging the upper limit in fig 3 as well as the values chosen for yw α β are dictated by the resistance of the adult sub category as previously noted the vulnerability of sub categories should be characterized by lower values of the impact parameter yet with the same parameter structure i e by keeping yw α and β fixed the critical threshold wk lim for the k th sub category is then a fraction of the critical impact parameter of the reference most resistant sub category wlim according to 11 w k lim w lim y w k y w α the above relation see appendix a means that the critical value for the k th sub category wk lim depends only on the physical parameters describing the k th sub category i e on ywk and it is independent of hydrodynamics fig 3 shows that the limit condition for children younger than 18 years old is well described by the w wk lim 0 35 isoline green line 3 1 2 relative damage functions the second step consists in assessing the relative damage functions according to the method outlined in sect 2 2 a sufficiently large and representative sample of off conditions should be considered for the case of people stability a rich experimental dataset is available fig 3 from each pair ui yi of the off events the associated value of wi is computed using eq 3 the cumulative frequency distribution of wi for the two sub categories plotted in fig 4 a gives the relative damage curve i e the probability to fail for each single individual belonging to a given sub category it is often convenient to interpolate the discrete cumulative distributions inferred from the data with a continuous function to express the relative damage among the possible forms a simple and effective expression is 12 rd w 1 1 a w b fig 4a compares the relative damage functions obtained for the two sub categories note that this is possible only because the hydrodynamic hazard is described by the same impact parameter for the case of people a good fit of the discrete data is found using eq 12 with a 0 25 and b 6 for children green line in fig 4 and a 0 6 and b 5 0 for adults black line in fig 4 thanks to the use of a single impact parameter to describe the hydrodynamic hazard for different sub categories the corresponding relative damage functions can be combined to provide a unique function for the whole category as a weighted average of the sub category relative damage functions 13 r d w j 1 n φ j r d j w where n is the number of sub categories φj is the percentage of objects belonging to the j th sub category and rdj w is the associated relative damage curve for example one can easily derive the relative damage functions for population living in countries with different distribution of children and adults e g the proportion of children is larger in asian than in european countries or for people that typically frequent different districts of a city e g the fraction of children is different in industrial and school areas making school areas more vulnerable an example is shown in fig 4b where starting from the relative damage functions for adults and children green and black lines we compute the relative damage functions for the italian population orange line considering 16 of children and 84 of adults according to istat 2020 for an industrial area assuming 5 of children and 95 of adults blue line and for a school area assuming 80 of children and 20 of adults light green line 3 1 3 comparison with previous approaches comparing the proposed approach with previous ones provides some interesting insights indeed some formulations have been previously proposed both in the scientific literature and in flood risk manuals to express flood damage for people in terms of a single hazard parameter which combines flow depth and velocity e g aidr 2017 bww brp buwal 2008 cox et al 2010 de moel et al 2009 ramsbottom et al 2006 smith et al 2014 in these works damage is classified with the use of thresholds that provide qualitative descriptions of vulnerability rather than quantitative measure of the expected damage unfortunately the use of dimensional parameters and of thresholds that are based on empirical evidence led to damage definitions lacking a clear meaning or with a weak physical constitution the significant discrepancies among the degree of damage predicted by different formulations as detailed in the following are signs of these weaknesses for example ramsbottom et al 2006 introduced the hazard rating index hr y u 0 5 and defined four ranges of hr corresponding to four qualitative probabilities of damage low hr 0 75 moderate 0 75 hr 1 25 significant 1 25 hr 2 5 and extreme hr 2 5 cox et al 2010 used the product number pn u y to identify the same four classes of damage probability thresholds for pn are 0 6 0 8 and 1 2 m2 s with additional conditions entailing the extreme damage probability when either u 3 0 m s for both adults and children y 1 2 m for adults or y 0 5 m for children in order to compare the two above classifications we compute the values of hr and pn for pairs u y in the range 0 u 5 m s and 0 y 2 5 m and check for the agreement between the associated risk classes the results are reported in fig 5 a for adults and in fig 5b children shaded areas denote the domain of all possible pn and hr the grey and the coloured areas mark agreement and disagreement between the two approaches respectively consider two examples of the damage probability for adults the couple u 3 m s y 0 2 m leads to hr 0 7 and to pn 0 6 both corresponding to the low class the two criteria agree this point falls in the grey area of fig 5a on the other hand the couple u 3 1 m s y 0 2 m leads to hr 0 74 low and to pn 0 64 extreme because of u 3 m s i e the probability of damage is three classes higher using pn rather than hr this point falls in the dark red area in fig 5a for the children sub category the classes of damage are three moderate and significant are merged by looking at fig 5b for children there are hazard conditions corresponding to moderate significant damage using hr and to extreme using pn large yellow area and even worse low damage probability using hr and extreme using pn orange area a partial reason for the above differences could be found in the use of the abt et al 1989 dataset to determine the hr thresholds ramsbottom et al 2006 the lack of a proper physical base of the above criteria likely played a role as well a comparison of the impact parameter w with the hr and pn criteria for assessing damage probability of adults black lines and symbols and children green lines and symbols is shown in fig 6 the isolines corresponding to extreme conditions according to the different criteria are superposed to the experimental data as observed the iso hr lines tend to overestimate the actual stability conditions whereas the iso pn lines fit the experimental data very well for flow velocities between 1 and 3 m s yet for the lowest and highest velocities the iso hr and iso pn lines are not physically sound for example when u 0 m s the hr approach predicts extreme conditions only for a water depth y 5 m which is a very large value in real flooding events indeed for the case u 0 the extreme limit hr 2 5 corresponds to y 5 m kvocka et al 2016 the pn approach excludes unrealistic results thanks to additional thresholds horizontal and vertical dashed segments in fig 6b nonetheless the upper limit of u 3 m s seems too much clear cut since some experimental data lay well beyond interestingly the iso w lines with suitable calibration factors well envelope the available experimental data and are consistent with the common sense as well 3 2 stability of vehicles in floodwaters a second application of the method to on off damaging processes involving vehicles is shortly presented as for the case of people instability of vehicles in floodwaters occurs due to a sliding mechanism caused by drag the physical problem is slightly complicated for the presence of the gap between the car and the ground martínez gomariz et al 2018 milanesi and pilotti 2019 xia et al 2011 and uncertainty about watertightness of vehicles bocanegra et al 2020 many studies in the technical literature relate the on off damaging condition of vehicles in flowing water to the in stability condition of the vehicle fig 7 collects data from bonham and hattersley 1967 gordon and stone 1973 keller and mitsch 1993 kramer et al 2016 martínez gomariz et al 2018 martínez gomariz et al 2019 milanesi and pilotti 2019 oshikawa et al 2011 shand et al 2011 shu et al 2011 smith et al 2019 teo et al 2012 toda et al 2013 xia et al 2011 xia et al 2014b within the vehicle category we consider three different sub categories small to medium cars medium to large cars suvs and vans the last one is taken as the reference category since it is the most resistant here to determine the calibration factors of w it is more convenient to adopt a data driven procedure which considers the physics of the problem as well since the instability is drag driven a reasonable choice for the parameter α is2 so that the static contribution to w corresponds to the hydrostatic force to fit the upper limit of stability of available data with a w 1 iso line suitable values of the model parameters are yw 0 9 m and β 0 6 these values correspond to the most resistant vans and suvs the limit stability conditions for the weaker sub categories are well described using the same values of yw α and β by isolines characterized by lower values of w specifically w 0 50 for medium to large and w 0 35 for small to medium vehicles fig 7 the fact that the same structure of the impact parameter w allows to describing the limit conditions of different sub categories confirms that the physics based and flexible structure of w well captures the key aspects of the damaging process of items within a given category the cumulative frequency distributions for each sub category fig 8 are evaluated using the data of fig 7 and are interpolated with continuous relative damage functions using eq 12 3 3 damage of buildings the procedure for assessing the vulnerability of objects subject to progressive damage is slightly different from that of on off damage processes to show this we use damage to residential buildings as an example experimental data on damage to buildings are scarce in the literature often refer to on off damage processes i e the collapse of buildings and are unsuitable for the objective of the analysis as they usually express damage in absolute terms rarely report information about flood velocity and do not contain enough information on building characteristics hampering their classification in classes of similar resistance for these reasons we base our analysis on relative damage data rd provided by the synthetic damage model insyde dottori et al 2016 molinari scorzini 2017 insyde is a synthetic probabilistic flood damage model based on a component by component explicit cost analysis and it is especially appropriate for our aim as it considers the role of many hazard variables in shaping damage including water depth and flow velocity as well as the main characteristics of buildings that determine their propensity to be damaged in similar ways here we consider residential buildings with standard italian features and geometry the variables building structure and number of floors are allowed to vary forming four sub categories of buildings i e reinforced concrete or masonry buildings with 1 or 2 floors the flood duration is assumed constant i e 6 h whereas sediment and contaminant loads are neglected in order to evaluate only the dependence of damage on water depth and velocity in detail for each sub category the insyde model is forced with a set of u y input data to generate a set of u y rd the first step for the definition of the damage model is determining the structure of the impact parameter w i e finding suitable values of yw α and β recalling the link between iso w and iso rd lines in the u y plane sect 2 2 the set of u y rd triplets provided by the insyde model allows identifying iso rd lines in the u y plane which makes the procedure more robust than for on off damage processes since rd 100 points in the u y plane are generally not available for objects subject to progressive damage total damage entails extreme thus rare forcing conditions matching the rd 1 limit condition with w 1 isolines makes little to no sense a sensible choice must be done to define for each sub category the value of rd associated to w 1 this value becomes a sort of reference relative damage and differently from the case of on off data values of w 1 can be expected for high hazard conditions we then set yw equal to the physically meaningful threshold yw 3 5 m which corresponds to the typical height of the first floor in italy of course choosing yw equal to the first floor height is just one of the possible choices proper values of the α and β factors can then be found by making the shape of iso w and iso rd lines as similar to each other as possible in doing so the analysis of the damage mechanisms can be of further support for the case under investigation physical reasoning suggests choosing α 1 as damage to buildings is mainly due to wetting which depends on water depth and flow energy rather than on flow force gems et al 2016 moreover for u 0 the impact parameter w reduces to a non dimensional measure of the water depth y scaled with the first floor height the best fit of data provided by insyde then leads to a suitable value of β fig 9 a displays the results obtained for the case of two storey masonry buildings for this sub category we obtain β 0 3 a relatively low value that confirms the marginal role of flow velocity and locates the structure of w between water depth and specific energy leelawat et al 2014 kreibich et al 2009 scorzini and frank 2017 looking at fig 9a where the different symbols represent rd const conditions the dependence of rd on the flow velocity u seems not well captured by iso w lines the reasons are manifold the flow velocity naturally plays a minor role in building damaging than for items subject to instability furthermore the insyde model contains simplifications and idealizations that include the linearization of processes and the use of internal thresholds e g the value of u becomes irrelevant from 2 3 to 5 m s associating iso w and iso rd lines provides couples of rd w for each sub category the interpolation of these points with a monotonically increasing relationship such as eq 12 gives the relative damage function fig 9b as for the previous cases the relative damage functions for different kinds of buildings can be compared on the same plot this is because hazard conditions are described by a structure of the impact parameter w that is shared by all the sub categories here considered in order to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed procedure based on the impact parameter w we generate random values for u y pairs with 0 u 5 m s and 0 y 5 m then for the two storey masonry building sub category we compute the corresponding values of relative damage using the insyde model and compare the results with the corresponding relative damage values provided by the relative damage functions of fig 9b the comparison reported in fig 10 shows a good agreement with a correlation coefficient r2 0 95 4 discussion the idea of combining water depth and flow velocity to express flood hazard is not new functional relations involving flow depth and velocity or equivalently the froude number are the typical outcome of physics based studies for flood loss of people and vehicles e g arrighi et al 2015 2017 jonkman and penning rowsell 2008 lind et al 2004 martínez gomariz et al 2016 2019 milanesi and pilotti 2019 milanesi et al 2015 postacchini et al 2021 shu et al 2011 smith et al 2019 xia et al 2014a xia et al 2014b aureli et al 2008 introduced the total depth d y 1 2 f 2 which includes the effect of flow inertia and represents the water depth at rest whose static force is equivalent to the total force of the flow combined with the outcomes of hydrodynamic models ferrari et al 2019 ferrari et al 2020 the total depth provides a spatially distributed picture of the hazard degree that is particularly significant for items subject to dragging i e when loss is a matter of forces kreibich et al 2009 explored the dependence of flood damage on different parameters involving flow depth and velocity concluding that the choice of the best parameter s depends on the kind of items considered among these parameters the product of flow depth and velocity y u known as flow intensity kreibich et al 2009 product number cox et al 2010 or flow magnitude arrighi et al 2020 found widespread applications in the loss assessment of people and vehicle in floodwaters e g aidr 2017 costabile et al 2020 a quite similar index is the hazard rating hr y u 0 5 introduced by ramsbottom et al 2006 and commented in previous section 3 1 3 as an important aspect many of the above impact parameters need to be complemented by specific thresholds which apply to basic quantities a notable example is the y u product number which does not represent any physically relevant principle and requires thresholds on both water depth and velocity to provide a measure of the risk degree in general conditions aidr 2017 cox et al 2010 the multifaceted picture of functional relations and impact parameters cited above suggests i the need for specific impact parameters to capture the damage processes of different kind of exposed items ii the fragmentation of approaches methods and outcomes deriving from a wealth of valuable studies dealing with specific object categories with a lack of common vision iii some inconsistencies that are the unavoidable consequence of fragmentation or insufficient physical foundation of which the extensive use of thresholds is a symptom these three factors act to limit the general applicability of previous methods and in some cases their robustness as well while the first factor is intrinsic of the problem the last ones deserve further attention the method we propose is a step to overcome these drawbacks as the impact parameter w is non dimensional thus expressing a degree of hazard independent of specific dimensions if opportunely scaled it provides an immediate measure of the hazard degree also when hazard is determined by particular combinations of both water depth and flow velocity this allows for an enhanced comprehension of damage causes and processes the impact parameter w is flexible hence capable of representing various damage mechanisms within a common frame as shown in the above applications this allows encompassing and complementing previous works on flood vulnerability which included water depth and velocity as explanatory variables indeed previous studies and analysis can be recast in a general common framework that allows obtaining elegant single variable relative damage curves for item categories subject to either progressive or on off damage the impact parameter w has a physical foundation as it ranges between the concept of energy and momentum and it can be fitted to available experimental and field data effectively without the need of additional thresholds this is expected to enhance the robustness of damage predictions also with respect to high dimensional multi variate models that can be ill conditioned in case of scarce data carisi et al 2018 merz et al 2013 wang et al 2015 the applications shown in section 3 proved that a given structure of the w parameter i e a couple of parameters α and β allows capturing the mechanisms of damage for categories of objects that share the same nature e g people vehicles etc and are exposed to the same damage process thus a single structure of w can be used to express the hazard degree of different sub categories that group objects characterized by different resistance this allows comparing the vulnerability of different items belonging to the same category and to express the vulnerability of a category depending on its composition by weight averaging the relative damage functions of sub categories this is particularly useful for comparing different vulnerability contexts and facilitates the evaluation of absolute or total damage when exposure is the same for different sub categories in other words the use of w allows expressing the hazard degree as a function of a single parameter thus enhancing the intelligibility of hazard information and simplifying damage assessment another remark regards the vulnerability of buildings we applied the proposed procedure considering the progressive damage caused by wetting which is the most challenging application because of the structure of the impact parameter w and of the marginal role played by flow velocity this choice was aimed at testing the flexibility of w better results are expected from the application of w to the case of building stability which can be undermined as a result of flow drag and buoyancy black 1975 mazzorana et al 2014 the physics of the problem shares fundamental similarities with the loss of stability of people and vehicles in floodwaters indeed the shape of stability thresholds for buildings dale et al 2004 middelmann fernandes 2010 bignami et al 2019 is very similar to the w isolines obtained in sect 3 1 and 3 2 a common aspect that can be observed in many studies on flood risk for on off items is the lack of fragility curves describing the actually gradual variation of the loss probability with the hazard degree in some cases the assessment is limited to hazard degree thresholds e g middelmann fernandes 2010 often the probability of loss is expressed by means of classes e g cox et al 2010 kvocka et al 2016 ramsbottom et al 2006 which makes difficult to obtain quantitative results e g expected losses moreover the identification of these classes is based on empirical considerations in other cases flood hazard rating is assumed to vary linearly with the ratio of the actual flow velocity to the incipient velocity i e the velocity at which person loses stability in floodwater kvocka et al 2016 but the real correspondence between hazard rating and fragility remains unknown the method we proposed to derive fragility curves section 2 2 allows expressing the loss probability explicitly it is based on the knowledge of a set of loss conditions derived either from experimental field data or from physics based models forced with a representative set of input data e g for varying the characteristics of exposed items a future development regards the inclusion of other variables within the impact parameter an example is the wind velocity that can contribute to human s vulnerability as demonstrated in the recent study on storm induced coastal flooding by wang and marsooli 2021 another important aspect that needs to be considered is the forcing duration which in fact deserves a particular attention damaging develops in time and the rate at which damage develops depends on the time variation of the forcing factors on one hand hydrodynamic models able to provide a spatially explicit detailed and accurate temporal evolution of water depth and flow velocity in flooded areas at local and regional scales are now largely available e g ferrari et al 2019 ferrari viero 2020 lacasta et al 2014 sanders schubert 2019 on the other hand expressing the hazard degree with a single impact parameter is beneficial to describe time dependence of the damage 5 conclusions in the present study a procedure is outlined to assess flood relative damage functions based on one single impact parameter describing the hydrodynamic action the proposed impact parameter w has a physics based flexible form that allows estimating the flood hazard degree for items subject to diverse damaging processes it is particularly useful when both water depth and flow velocity play a role in the damage process the application of the proposed impact parameter to assess the vulnerability to floods of people vehicles and residential buildings confirmed the flexibility of the formulation and showed advantages of using a physics based explicit approach relative damage functions are assessed through a data driven procedure which is based on the use of either real data both synthetic or experimental bearing sufficient information on flood features i e hazard degree and the damage to exposed items after determining a suitable structure of the impact parameter w the relative damage functions are assessed in a probabilistic framework for on off damage process like those related to the stability of people or vehicles in flowing water and with a deterministic fitting procedure for progressive damage processes yet the relative damage functions obtained through the two approaches are equivalent for practical application purposes adopting the impact parameter w traditional depth damage functions and fragility curves are enhanced by including the flow velocity as hazard determinant and multi variable damage functions are reverted to simpler and more elegant single variable non dimensional functions previous damage and loss models can be recast in a unique simple and elegant form the flexibility of the present formulation also allows for an easy merging of physics based reasoning and available data which can result in enhanced model robustness credit authorship

competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a impact parameters for different sub categories here we derive in terms of impact parameter w the limit condition of full loss for different sub categories of exposed items without loss of generality let us consider two sub categories and start looking at each sub category as a single category for the most resistant category denoted as reference category eq 3 defines the impact parameter for given yw α and β 14 w y y w α 1 β f 2 the full loss of items in the reference category is denoted by the limit condition w wlim for simplicity this limit can be thought as wlim 1 for the k th weaker sub category taken individually the impact parameter is 15 w k y y w k α 1 β f 2 y w y w k α y y w α 1 β f 2 y w y w k α w in eq 15 the parameters α and β remain the same as in eq 14 as the physics of damage process is the same for the whole category again ywk is chosen to identify the sub category limit condition of full loss as w k wlim in this way for a given flow condition y f the resulting impact parameter is different for each sub category in particular larger values are obtained for weaker sub categories i e w k w since ywk is smaller than yw this occurrence is indeed annoying for example it prevents plotting iso w lines of different sub categories onto the same y u plane it is far more convenient to have a biunivocal correspondence between w and the flow conditions y f for an entire category of similar exposed items this is achieved by rescaling the impact parameter of weaker sub categories w k by a factor ywk yw α which corresponds to using a single reference depth namely yw for the whole category the limit condition associated to the k th sub category denoted with wk lim is rescaled accordingly 16 w k lim y w k y w α w lim as a final result for a given flow condition y f the impact parameter w is the same for different sub categories for items belonging to the k th sub category the hazard degree is then expressed by the ratio w wk lim 
3543,core scale spontaneous imbibition experiments and numerical simulations have demonstrated that the macroscopic imbibition performance is significantly different under different boundary conditions however the detailed pore scale flow mechanisms behind these phenomena and the influence of porous media s geometric features on the imbibition behavior under different boundaries have not been addressed in depth in this work an optimized color gradient lattice boltzmann model is applied to simulate spontaneous imbibition in granular media under four boundary conditions the influence of grain shape and packing pattern on the two phase interface evolution and the recovery factor during spontaneous imbibition is investigated while fixing different models porosity grain number and size distribution it is found that the grain shape has little influence on the drainage interface evolution at the initial stage but it has a more significant influence on the imbibition interface during counter current spontaneous imbibition the grain packing pattern influences the evolution of drainage and imbibition interfaces and the recovery factor spontaneous imbibition with different boundary conditions has different imbibition rates and ultimate recovery factors the fastest imbibition rate and highest ultimate recovery are obtained under all faces open and two faces open free boundary conditions respectively this research provides pore scale insights into the complex dynamic fluid displacement mechanism between the fracture and matrix of fractured oil and gas reservoirs keywords pore scale flow lattice boltzmann model spontaneous imbibition grain shape grain packing pattern 1 introduction spontaneous imbibition where a wetting fluid displaces a nonwetting fluid driven by capillary pressure is an important process to improve oil gas recovery from fractured reservoirs especially for tight and low permeability reservoirs al hadhrami and blunt 2001 morrow and mason 2001 cai et al 2014 due to the complexity of the fracture matrix system and various development conditions during waterflooding the displacement process between water in fracture and oil residing in matrix is exceptionally complex during spontaneous imbibition abbasi et al 2020 essentially the factors that complicate this process include not only the nature of the matrix and fluid system itself but also how the fractured matrix comes into contact with the water in the fractures hatiboglu and babadagli 2007 mason and morrow 2013 zaeri et al 2018 yang et al 2019 cai et al 2020 yu et al 2021 different boundary conditions as shown in fig 1 are introduced in core based imbibition experiments and simulations to mimic various scenarios in which the fractured matrix is partially or entirely immersed in water in actual reservoirs morrow and mason 2001 meng and cai 2018 for example the boundary conditions of all faces open afo and one end open oeo describe the situation where the matrix is totally immersed in water and the situation where only one end face is in contact with water respectively the boundary condition of two ends open teo describes a situation where both ends touch the water in comparison teo free describes a situation where one of the two ends is open to oil andersen et al 2019 besides there are other boundary conditions such as time dependent boundary conditions which mimic the matrix being dynamically immersed by water in fractures with a specific flow rate harimi et al 2019 under these different boundary conditions water and oil may flow in the same or opposite direction unsal et al 2007a unsal et al 2007b accordingly spontaneous imbibition can be classified as co current and counter current imbibition core scale spontaneous imbibition experiments and numerical simulations with different boundary conditions have been extensively carried out to explore the differences in imbibition performance standnes 2004 lai et al 2016 typically imbibition performance is evaluated in terms of imbibition rate ultimate recovery the shape of the recovery curve and whether it satisfies a linear relationship with the square root of time hamidpour et al 2015 gao et al 2018 cai et al 2021 xia et al 2021 yildiz et al 2006 performed spontaneous imbibition experiments on berea sandstone samples under four boundary conditions afo teo two ends close tec and oeo they found that the imbibition rate is the fastest under afo and that increasing the total area open to imbibition can enhance the spontaneous imbibition rate this trend was demonstrated by abd and alyafei 2018 through numerical simulations although the highest imbibition rate under afo was also found in the imbibition experiments with tight rock carried by lyu et al 2019 the lowest imbibition rate and ultimate recovery were obtained under teo not the oeo in the above work also they found that the linear relationship between oil recovery and the square root of time is well fitted for tec imbibition but worst fitted for teo imbibition however also for tight rocks zhang et al 2019 found that the linear relationship for tec imbibition fits well at the initial stage but poorly at the late stage the recovery curve of oeo imbibition satisfies a linear relationship with the square root of time by closing or opening some of the four boundaries of the two dimensional 2d matrix block spontaneous imbibition under five boundary conditions was simulated by meng et al 2019 results show that the shape of recovery curves varies with different boundary conditions due to the overlap of fluid flow between different open faces for the teo free imbibition the numerical simulation results by pooladi darvish and firoozabadi 2000 reveal that the oil recovery is dominated by the co current imbibition as long as the parts of the rock surface are in contact with the oil compared to counter current imbibition co current imbibition is more efficient in both imbibition rate and ultimate recovery in addition some studies pay more attention to the influence of certain factors on spontaneous imbibition under different boundary conditions cheng et al 2019 found that the heterogeneity of tight rock samples strongly affected both the imbibition rate and ultimate recovery under teo but only affected the imbibition rate under afo these studies enhance our understanding of the macroscopic behavior of spontaneous imbibition and help to guide our engineering practices since macroscopic behavior is controlled by pore scale flow mechanisms it would undoubtedly help us immensely if we could fully understand spontaneous imbibition at both the macroscopic and microscopic scales pore scale numerical simulations especially direct simulations are widely used to study the imbibition behavior under different boundary conditions due to their ability to readily demonstrate velocity and pressure field distributions compared to conventional experiments blunt et al 2013 golparvar et al 2018 sun and zhang 2020 diao et al 2021 liu et al 2021 since the computational domain in simulations usually has a 2d square or three dimensional 3d block shape the word face and its abbreviation f uniformly denote a surface that is open to the water using the phase field method jafari et al 2017 and rokhforouz and akhlaghi amiri 2017 investigated the influences of multiple factors including geometric configuration fracture aperture and grain shape fluid properties interfacial tension and viscosity ratio operating condition water injection velocity and wettability on counter current spontaneous imbibition within a 2d porous medium under ofo they analyzed the characteristics of oil recovery curves and revealed the microscopic mechanisms captured during imbibition including snap off interface coalescence water film bridging and oil film thinning the imbibition behavior influenced by these factors under ofo has also been systematically studied by gu et al 2019 using the color gradient lattice boltzmann model cg lbm the most prominent result they found is that the oil discharged into a fracture in three regimes i e squeezing jetting and dripping regime under the control of the water injection velocity and the interfacial tension parameters using the shan chen lattice boltzmann model sc lbm hatiboglu and babadagli 2008 simulated spontaneous imbibition with ofo and tfo boundary conditions in a 2d porous medium and compared the simulation results with microscopic visualization experiment results they demonstrated that the sc lbm could simulate the effect of gravity and correctly capture the pore scale physical mechanisms during co current and counter current imbibition using a modified sc lbm zheng et al 2018 investigated the spontaneous imbibition behavior of fracturing fluid within the 3d shale matrix with complex pore structure and mixed wettability characteristics the results show that the fracturing fluid is first quickly absorbed into the large pores and then gradually migrates into the hydrophilic nanopores thus leading to a nonuniform menisci propagation there were of course other simulation studies on spontaneous imbibition gunde et al 2013 wiklund and uesaka 2013 xiao et al 2019 however most studies above are mainly based on 2d geometries and focus on imbibition behavior under ofo or and tfo boundary conditions undoubtedly pore scale simulations of spontaneous imbibition in 3d porous media with different boundary conditions can effectively complement these studies in this study by adopting lattice boltzmann simulations the influences of the geometric characteristics of the granular porous medium on spontaneous imbibition performances are investigated under different boundary conditions the organization of the paper is as follows section 2 presents the basic algorithm of the color gradient lattice boltzmann model and the method used to generate the granular porous medium then describes the realization of different imbibition boundary conditions and a detailed simulation setup as well as a model validation case simulation results are presented and discussed in sections 3 and 4 the influences of grain shape and grain packing pattern on imbibition behavior under various boundary conditions are analyzed in detail finally we conclude in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 color gradient lattice boltzmann model in this work an optimized cg lbm with multiple relaxation time mrt scheme was adopted to simulate spontaneous imbibition in granular media toelke et al 2006 in this model three evolution equations for the particle distribution functions are developed to track the momentum transport of the fluid system and the mass transport of each fluid component respectively among them the momentum transport equation is 1 f i r c i δ t t δ t f i r t ω i which describes the evolution of fluid particle distribution function f i r t in discrete time t and discrete space r timm et al 2016 the macroscopic fluid density ρ and velocity u can then be calculated by 2 ρ i f i 3 ρ u i c i f i where c i is the lattice velocity vector and it has the following values for the three dimensional nineteen velocity d3q19 lattice model qian et al 1992 4 c i 0 0 0 i 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 i 1 2 6 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 i 7 8 18 an mrt scheme was adopted as the collision operator to improve the accuracy and stability of the calculations 5 ω m 1 s m m eq where the transformation matrix m is responsible for transforming the fluid particle distribution function into moment space the equilibrium vector m eq contains multiple moments through which the fluid interface tension can be introduced toelke et al 2006 ahrenholz et al 2008 the diagonal matrix s contains multiple relaxation rates e g 19 for d3q19 with them the fluid viscosity can be set but the stability of the numerical calculation can be improved by careful tuning coveney et al 2002 saito et al 2017 for an immiscible fluid system consisting of wetting and nonwetting fluids the two phase fluid components can be indicated by an order parameter ϕ defined as 6 ϕ ρ w ρ nw ρ w ρ nw thus the phase field distribution can be represented by only one parameter calculated from the component densities ρ w and ρ nw i e the order parameter with values of 1 and 1 indicates the bulk phase of wetting and nonwetting fluids respectively while its value between 1 and 1 indicates the diffusion interface based on the phase field distribution the color gradient c used to characterize the interaction between fluid components can be calculated as 7 c r t ϕ 1 c s 2 δ t i ω i c i ϕ r c i δ t t where the weight coefficients w i corresponding to the d3q19 model are given as 8 ω i 1 3 i 0 1 18 i 1 2 6 1 36 i 7 8 18 two other lattice boltzmann equations namely the mass transport equations are introduced to track the component densities φ ρ w ρ nw and their evolution equations are as follows 9 g i r c i δ t t δ t w i φ 1 1 c s 2 c i u the solutions of the mass and momentum transport equations are coupled through the color gradient and the fluid velocity therefore cg lbm can effectively handle the immiscible fluid flow the detailed derivation process of the model and its application to two phase flow in porous media can be found in the work of jiang et al 2014 bakhshian and hosseini 2019 2 2 granular media generation six grain packing models with different grain shapes and packing patterns fig 2 are generated by using the discrete element method dem cundall and strack 1979 all models have similar porosity approximately 0 45 resulting from 600 grains with the same size distribution settling in a square box under gravity s influence all grains within the same model have the same shape but their diameters d follow a normal distribution i e d n μ σ 2 μ 150 σ 30 here we consider two packing patterns i e random and regular packing and three different grain shapes including one spherical and two non spherical irregular shapes irregular grains are obtained by modifying the sphere s surface mesh with varying amplitudes of coherent noise while keeping the volume unchanged for the specific algorithm please refer to the work of al ibrahim et al 2019 to quantitatively describe the shape of the grains we introduced sphericity ψ which is defined as the ratio of the surface area of a sphere having the same volume v p as the grain to the surface area a p of the grain as follows 10 ψ π 1 3 6 v p 2 3 a p sphericity describes how closely a grain resembles a sphere zhou et al 2018 the more similar the shape is to the sphere the closer the value of ψ is to 1 note that the average sphericity of all grains in the same spherical model in this work is 0 991 due to the influence of spatial voxelization the average sphericity of irregularly shaped grains is 0 953 and 0 929 respectively and the smaller its value is the more irregular its shape gets for convenience these three shapes of grains are referred to as sphere nonsphere a and nonsphere b respectively according to their sphericity in descending order to effectively impose imbibition boundary conditions at both ends of the x direction in subsequent simulations we excised some voxels at these ends the models after this treatment are directly used for the spontaneous imbibition simulation with different boundary conditions and their detailed geometrical parameters are given in table 1 2 3 model setup spontaneous imbibition with four boundary conditions shown in fig 3 is simulated based on the above generated grain packing models different boundary conditions are realized by closing and opening some faces of the box shaped media model and putting the open faces in contact with water or oil reservoir for afo imbibition there is only one scenario for each model since the model is surrounded by water however for tfo and tfo free imbibition there can be multiple scenarios due to the relative distribution of the two open faces in this study a scenario where two open faces perpendicular to the x axis is considered in the tfo and tfo free imbibition simulations to simplify the work in addition for the random packing model only the scenario where the water reservoir contacts with the x open face is considered to further simplify the work due to its relatively homogeneous grain distribution therefore spontaneous imbibition with ofo or tfo free boundary conditions in the random packing model corresponds to only one simulation case in contrast both scenarios where the water reservoir contacts with x and x open face are considered for the regular packing model due to significant grain size differences in this direction accordingly ofo x ofo x and tfo free x tfo free x are used in this work to distinguish the different scenarios the water and oil reservoirs in the simulation like fractures underground provide water supply and oil discharge during spontaneous imbibition however previous studies have shown that fracture aperture affects spontaneous imbibition jafari et al 2017 gu et al 2019 in order to exclude such influence the thickness of water and oil reservoirs is set to 0 2 and 0 05 mm respectively in all simulations the boundary conditions used in the spontaneous imbibition simulation are the same as those used in the following capillary filling simulation i e the bounce back boundary condition is imposed at both the pore solid interface and the solid wall while the periodic boundary condition is imposed at both the water and oil reservoir boundaries besides the periodic boundary conditions on the boundary perpendicular to the x axis are also subjected to a particular treatment that is the distribution function that streams into the reservoir is transformed into that of the fluid it contains to ensure an infinite supply of water or a continuous discharge of oil the same fluid system i e water is the wetting fluid dodecane is the nonwetting fluid and the consistent contact angle θ 30 is used in all simulations the specific properties of the fluids used in the simulations are shown in table 1 2 4 model validation capillary filling originated from the pioneering work of lucas 1918 and washburn 1921 is used to validate the ability of cg lbm in simulating spontaneous imbibition in this work suppose the gravity and inertia effects are neglected in that case the wetting fluid filling a capillary tube is controlled by only capillary force and viscous resistance then the capillary filling length l with time t can be expressed by the following equation zhu et al 2016 11 μ w μ n 2 l 2 l 0 2 μ n l l l 0 r σ cos θ 6 t where μ w μ nw is the viscosity of the wetting nonwetting fluid and σ is the interface tension l and r are the length and radius of the capillary tube respectively two capillary tubes both 3 mm in length but with radii of 47 5 and 70 μm respectively are used in capillary filling simulations for the perfect realization of capillary filling on the one hand a water reservoir and an oil reservoir with a length of 1 mm are added to the opposite end of the capillary tube fig 4 a for water supply and oil drainage separately on the other hand periodic boundary conditions are applied to all water and oil reservoirs walls the same fluid systems i e water and dodecane referred to as oil are used in all simulations and their physical properties are shown in table 1 the simulation results and the analytical solutions of capillary filling length fig 4 b are in good agreement proving the accuracy and capacity of the model we used in simulating spontaneous imbibition 3 simulation results 3 1 ofo spontaneous imbibition the oil water interface during spontaneous imbibition with ofo boundary condition can be divided into two parts the imbibition and the drainage interface based on the flow direction gu et al 2019 bakhshian et al 2020 the former is the meniscus formed by the water imbibition into relatively small pores while the latter is the result of oil drainage into the water reservoir movie s1 demonstrates the dynamic evolution of the oil water interface during ofo imbibition for random and regular packing models the drainage interface which formed rapidly at the initial stage is progressively snapped off and a large number of oil droplets are formed in the water reservoir as the drainage interface area decreases the imbibition interface advances slower accordingly and the ofo imbibition eventually reaches a steady state fig 5 shows the oil distribution of ofo imbibition in all models at 1 784 ms and steady state to demonstrate the evolutionary characteristics of drainage and imbibition interfaces by comparing the number and size of the drainage meniscus in fig 5 the drainage interfaces in different models are significantly different horizontally grain shape remains the same while they are more similar vertically grain packing pattern remains the same results indicate that the packing pattern and water reservoir location affect the formation of the drainage interface these two factors essentially change the grains in contact with the water reservoir for different models in other words the grain size distribution on the open face fig 5 from left to right random size relatively uniform large size and small size respectively is essentially responsible for the differences between drainage interfaces there are some differences in the two phase interface morphology and imbibition depth at steady state within different models fig 5 horizontally the two phase interface within the regular packing model under ofo x is extraordinarily irregular and shows a distinct fingering morphology with the most profound imbibition depth in contrast it has a flatter morphology with the shallowest imbibition depth in the regular packing model under ofo x correspondingly these differences in the imbibition interface are more intuitively reflected in the recovery curve fig 6 for models with the same grain shape the imbibition rate and ultimate recovery factor of the random packing model are more significant than that of the regular packing model under ofo x but less than that of the regular packing model under ofo x thus it is illustrated that the grain packing pattern and water reservoir location significantly affect the spontaneous imbibition for models with the same packing pattern the fingering morphology and imbibition depth become more pronounced with decreasing grain sphericity especially in random packing models with nonsphere b grains and regular packing models under ofo x correspondingly it is evident in fig 6 that the model with the more irregular shape has a faster imbibition rate and a higher ultimate recovery factor 3 2 tfo spontaneous imbibition overall the drainage interface evolution in tfo imbibition under the influence of granular media structure fig 7 is more similar to that in ofo imbibition specifically the grain size distribution on the open face rather than the grain shape strongly influences the drainage interface evolution for the same granular media model the drainage interfaces on the same open face during ofo and tfo imbibition are almost identical in terms of morphology number and location of the meniscus as shown in figs 5 and 7 the imbibition behavior at the initial stage under tfo is more like a combination of the counter current imbibition results under ofo x and ofo x therefore these results further demonstrate that the drainage interface evolution is more influenced by the local grain distribution movie s2 demonstrates the tfo imbibition process within random and regular packing pattern models results show that the packing pattern strongly influences the two phase interface evolution during imbibition the drainage interface evolution at the later stage of imbibition influenced by the grain size gradient proceeds mainly on the x open face in the regular packing model while in the random packing model it proceeds simultaneously on both open faces the imbibition interfaces in random packing models initially located on both open faces and subsequently moving towards the model interior have similar morphologies and imbibition depth however the imbibition depth within the regular packing model is significantly deeper on the x side so that the remaining oil is mainly near the x side in addition the imbibition interface evolution is also influenced by the grain shape a distinct fingering morphology is formed in the model with the most irregular grain shape nonsphere b grains a remarkable phenomenon was also observed in the tfo imbibition due to the relatively small pore size near solid walls the imbibition interfaces originating from two open faces meet first near the solid wall and form new interfaces that displace the oil along the other direction this flow characteristic of the imbibition interface is the main feature in the capillary fingering regime the oil recovery curves of tfo imbibition for different models are shown in fig 8 for models with the same packing pattern the more irregular the grain shape the faster the imbibition rate and the higher the ultimate recovery factor for models with the same grain shape the imbibition rate and ultimate recovery factor of the regular packing model are significantly greater than those of the random packing model these differences exhibited by the oil recovery curves directly correspond to the morphological characteristics and imbibition depth of the two phase interface within the different models 3 3 tfo free spontaneous imbibition relative to the imbibition with ofo and tfo boundary conditions the oil droplets formed in tfo free imbibition are relatively small fig 9 although the drainage menisci under these boundaries are more similar in number and location as seen from movie s3 the drainage interface is quickly snapped off and continuous oil production proceeds mainly through the co current flow in contrast the imbibition interface within the regular packing model exhibits significant differences depending on the water reservoir location under tfo free x the imbibition interface exhibits a distinct fingering morphology and the lagging fluid interface is snapped off to form residual oil clusters however under tfo free x the two phase interface as a whole is relatively regular and only the spherical or small residual oil is formed within single or adjacent pores fig 9 this phenomenon is mainly caused by the grain size gradient along the flow direction previous studies have shown that the pore size gradient can trigger or inhibit capillary fingering depending on whether the pore size decreases or increases along the flow direction al housseiny et al 2012 lu et al 2019 for spontaneous imbibition with tfo free x and tfo free x boundary conditions in a regular packing model it is the diverging grain size along the flow direction under tfo free x that leads to a relatively faster imbibition rate and higher ultimate recovery factor fig 10 b however for different models with the same packing pattern and reservoir location their oil recovery curves show almost the same trend as shown in fig 10 a indicating that the grain shape has less influence on the tfo free spontaneous imbibition 3 4 afo spontaneous imbibition due to the significant increase in computational domain size with six water reservoirs the afo imbibition simulations for the random and regular packing models were stopped at 30 and 40 ms based on the oil recovery curves in fig 12 respectively to achieve a reasonable computational resource consumption for spontaneous imbibition with afo boundary condition one of the most remarkable features is that many drainage menisci form quickly and cover all model faces at the initial stage fig 11 for the random packing model the volume of oil droplets on the four surfaces surrounding the x axis is relatively large and these droplets are snapped off first as seen in movie s4 however oil droplets with relatively large volumes are mainly located near the large grains for the regular packing model thus these results suggest that the grain packing pattern influences the formation of the drainage interface to better visualize the remaining oil distribution in the pore space after afo imbibition reaches a steady state all water reservoirs surrounding the medium model are removed and not shown in fig 11 the two phase interface morphology within random and regular packing models with the same grain shape is relatively similar but the remaining oil location is slightly different the remaining oil in the random model occupies the central portion of the model while the remaining oil within the regular model is closer to the end with the large sized grains for models with the same packing pattern the more irregular the grain shape the more pronounced the capillary fingering the imbibition rate for all models in fig 12 is the fastest at the initial 5 ms and slows down rapidly after that correspondingly many drainage menisci are snapped off leaving only one or two drainage menisci to discharge oil slowly during the rapid imbibition stage the recovery curves of the random and regular packing models show similar behavior i e the imbibition rates of the non spherical grain models are closer and they are larger than that of the spherical grain packing model during the slow imbibition stage the recovery curves within the regular packing models show significant differences with the more irregular the grain shape the faster the imbibition rate and the higher the ultimate recovery factor 4 discussion the imbibition performance of the same structure under different boundary conditions is further discussed just like the routine analysis in core scale imbibition experiments fig 13 illustrates the recovery curves of spontaneous imbibition with four different boundary conditions in the random and regular packing models of spherical grains significant differences can be observed among these recovery curves to better describe that the recovery curve is divided into three stages fast slow and steady depending on the imbibition rate for example a rough division of these three stages for the recovery curve under tfo is shown in fig 13a in the fast stage the models with two different packing patterns exhibit the same imbibition performance under different boundary conditions i e the imbibition rates are in the order of afo tfo tfo free ofo from fast to slow the more the water reservoir is added the faster the imbibition rate is at the initial stage besides the duration of the fast imbibition stage varies significantly under different boundaries that is the duration is longest under tfo free while it becomes shorter under afo tfo and ofo sequentially the duration of the slow imbibition stage also varies greatly under different boundaries under afo and tfo free imbibition shifts rapidly to a steady state after fast imbibition and accordingly there is a sharp turn in the recovery curve under tfo the slow stage duration is the longest and the recovery curve of the regular packing model even shows a uniformly increasing trend during this stage the recovery factor after reaching the steady state i e the ultimate recovery factor is also significantly different under different boundary conditions the ultimate recovery factor of random and regular packing models under different boundary conditions is in descending order tfo free afo tfo ofo in summary increasing the number of water reservoirs can significantly increase the imbibition rate at the initial stage while introducing an oil reservoir on the opposing open face can significantly increase the fast imbibition stage duration these two factors together affect the ultimate oil recovery factor fig 14 summarizes the ultimate recovery factor obtained in all simulation cases results show that the ultimate recovery factor under different boundary conditions remains in the same order i e tfo free afo tfo ofo in descending order for all the granular media models used in this work therefore the boundary conditions have the most significant influence on spontaneous imbibition compared to the porous media geometry used in this work besides it is observed that the grain shape affects the ultimate recovery factor to varying degrees under different boundary conditions for the random packing model fig 14 a the difference in the ultimate recovery factor is most pronounced under the ofo and tfo boundary conditions with the more irregular the shape the higher the ultimate recovery factor under both conditions this trend occurs under the ofo x tfo and afo boundary conditions for the regular packing model the above results show in detail the microscopic flow mechanism and imbibition efficiency behind spontaneous imbibition with different boundary conditions which provides some insight into our practical engineering activities since spontaneous imbibition is a two phase flow completely dominated by capillary forces the fluid interface evolution during fluid flow directly determines the overall imbibition performance however the two phase interface evolution during spontaneous imbibition may play a dual role simultaneously i e the imbibition interface and the drainage interface whose capillary forces provide the driving force and resistance to fluid flow respectively therefore the factors affecting the spontaneous imbibition performance are rooted in those affecting the distribution of imbibition and drainage interfaces these factors include the boundary condition which determines the two phase interface distribution at the initial moments of imbibition and the porous media structure which determines the imbibition and drainage interface distribution and the difference between their capillary force magnitudes there is no doubt that a larger imbibition interface contributes to a higher imbibition efficiency while a more significant difference in capillary forces between the imbibition and drainage interfaces contributes to a longer imbibition duration and these two factors together determine the ultimate recovery factor therefore in practical engineering activities such as waterflooding development of fractured reservoirs we should make the fractured rock matrix in the reservoir as much as possible in a scenario favorable to spontaneous imbibition so that the two phase interface serves almost completely as imbibition interface just like the spontaneous imbibition with the tfo free boundary condition in order to enhance oil recovery 5 conclusions in this work using an optimized color gradient lattice boltzmann model we investigated the influence of geometric features of granular media including grain shape and packing pattern on spontaneous imbibition under four different boundary conditions the main findings are summarized as follows 1 the influence of grain shape on the imbibition interface evolution and oil recovery factor is strong for counter current spontaneous imbibition but relatively weak for co current spontaneous imbibition for spontaneous imbibition with ofo tfo and afo boundary conditions the more irregular the grain shape is the more pronounced the imbibition interface s fingering morphology gets then the deeper the imbibition depth becomes and correspondingly the higher value the oil recovery factor has however under all boundary conditions applied in this work the grain shape has less influence on the drainage at the initial stage 2 the grain packing pattern influences the two phase interface evolution and the recovery factor the grain size distribution on the open face owing to different grain packing patterns results in some differences in the number and size of the drainage meniscus at the initial stage between the random and regular packing models the grain size gradient along the x direction in the regular packing pattern makes the imbibition interface evolution during tfo and afo imbibition of this model easier at the x side so that the imbibition interface on that side has a pronounced fingering morphology and deep imbibition depth 3 boundary conditions compared to the geometric features used in this work have the greatest influence on the spontaneous imbibition performance so the recovery curve characteristics vary greatly for different boundary conditions the larger the open face in contact with water is the higher the imbibition rate becomes so that spontaneous imbibition with the afo boundary condition has the highest imbibition rate due to the long duration of the rapid imbibition stage under the tfo free boundary condition the ultimate recovery factor is the highest under this condition this work provides pore scale insights into the dynamic fluid displacement mechanism during spontaneous imbibition however the inherent characteristics of granular porous media such as large porosity and good connectivity make them far from comparable to the complex pore structure in actual reservoirs with the help of high precision imaging techniques such as micro computed tomography and dual beam electron microscopy more future work can focus on the detailed spontaneous imbibition behavior within low permeability and tight reservoirs credit authorship contribution statement yang liu

3543,core scale spontaneous imbibition experiments and numerical simulations have demonstrated that the macroscopic imbibition performance is significantly different under different boundary conditions however the detailed pore scale flow mechanisms behind these phenomena and the influence of porous media s geometric features on the imbibition behavior under different boundaries have not been addressed in depth in this work an optimized color gradient lattice boltzmann model is applied to simulate spontaneous imbibition in granular media under four boundary conditions the influence of grain shape and packing pattern on the two phase interface evolution and the recovery factor during spontaneous imbibition is investigated while fixing different models porosity grain number and size distribution it is found that the grain shape has little influence on the drainage interface evolution at the initial stage but it has a more significant influence on the imbibition interface during counter current spontaneous imbibition the grain packing pattern influences the evolution of drainage and imbibition interfaces and the recovery factor spontaneous imbibition with different boundary conditions has different imbibition rates and ultimate recovery factors the fastest imbibition rate and highest ultimate recovery are obtained under all faces open and two faces open free boundary conditions respectively this research provides pore scale insights into the complex dynamic fluid displacement mechanism between the fracture and matrix of fractured oil and gas reservoirs keywords pore scale flow lattice boltzmann model spontaneous imbibition grain shape grain packing pattern 1 introduction spontaneous imbibition where a wetting fluid displaces a nonwetting fluid driven by capillary pressure is an important process to improve oil gas recovery from fractured reservoirs especially for tight and low permeability reservoirs al hadhrami and blunt 2001 morrow and mason 2001 cai et al 2014 due to the complexity of the fracture matrix system and various development conditions during waterflooding the displacement process between water in fracture and oil residing in matrix is exceptionally complex during spontaneous imbibition abbasi et al 2020 essentially the factors that complicate this process include not only the nature of the matrix and fluid system itself but also how the fractured matrix comes into contact with the water in the fractures hatiboglu and babadagli 2007 mason and morrow 2013 zaeri et al 2018 yang et al 2019 cai et al 2020 yu et al 2021 different boundary conditions as shown in fig 1 are introduced in core based imbibition experiments and simulations to mimic various scenarios in which the fractured matrix is partially or entirely immersed in water in actual reservoirs morrow and mason 2001 meng and cai 2018 for example the boundary conditions of all faces open afo and one end open oeo describe the situation where the matrix is totally immersed in water and the situation where only one end face is in contact with water respectively the boundary condition of two ends open teo describes a situation where both ends touch the water in comparison teo free describes a situation where one of the two ends is open to oil andersen et al 2019 besides there are other boundary conditions such as time dependent boundary conditions which mimic the matrix being dynamically immersed by water in fractures with a specific flow rate harimi et al 2019 under these different boundary conditions water and oil may flow in the same or opposite direction unsal et al 2007a unsal et al 2007b accordingly spontaneous imbibition can be classified as co current and counter current imbibition core scale spontaneous imbibition experiments and numerical simulations with different boundary conditions have been extensively carried out to explore the differences in imbibition performance standnes 2004 lai et al 2016 typically imbibition performance is evaluated in terms of imbibition rate ultimate recovery the shape of the recovery curve and whether it satisfies a linear relationship with the square root of time hamidpour et al 2015 gao et al 2018 cai et al 2021 xia et al 2021 yildiz et al 2006 performed spontaneous imbibition experiments on berea sandstone samples under four boundary conditions afo teo two ends close tec and oeo they found that the imbibition rate is the fastest under afo and that increasing the total area open to imbibition can enhance the spontaneous imbibition rate this trend was demonstrated by abd and alyafei 2018 through numerical simulations although the highest imbibition rate under afo was also found in the imbibition experiments with tight rock carried by lyu et al 2019 the lowest imbibition rate and ultimate recovery were obtained under teo not the oeo in the above work also they found that the linear relationship between oil recovery and the square root of time is well fitted for tec imbibition but worst fitted for teo imbibition however also for tight rocks zhang et al 2019 found that the linear relationship for tec imbibition fits well at the initial stage but poorly at the late stage the recovery curve of oeo imbibition satisfies a linear relationship with the square root of time by closing or opening some of the four boundaries of the two dimensional 2d matrix block spontaneous imbibition under five boundary conditions was simulated by meng et al 2019 results show that the shape of recovery curves varies with different boundary conditions due to the overlap of fluid flow between different open faces for the teo free imbibition the numerical simulation results by pooladi darvish and firoozabadi 2000 reveal that the oil recovery is dominated by the co current imbibition as long as the parts of the rock surface are in contact with the oil compared to counter current imbibition co current imbibition is more efficient in both imbibition rate and ultimate recovery in addition some studies pay more attention to the influence of certain factors on spontaneous imbibition under different boundary conditions cheng et al 2019 found that the heterogeneity of tight rock samples strongly affected both the imbibition rate and ultimate recovery under teo but only affected the imbibition rate under afo these studies enhance our understanding of the macroscopic behavior of spontaneous imbibition and help to guide our engineering practices since macroscopic behavior is controlled by pore scale flow mechanisms it would undoubtedly help us immensely if we could fully understand spontaneous imbibition at both the macroscopic and microscopic scales pore scale numerical simulations especially direct simulations are widely used to study the imbibition behavior under different boundary conditions due to their ability to readily demonstrate velocity and pressure field distributions compared to conventional experiments blunt et al 2013 golparvar et al 2018 sun and zhang 2020 diao et al 2021 liu et al 2021 since the computational domain in simulations usually has a 2d square or three dimensional 3d block shape the word face and its abbreviation f uniformly denote a surface that is open to the water using the phase field method jafari et al 2017 and rokhforouz and akhlaghi amiri 2017 investigated the influences of multiple factors including geometric configuration fracture aperture and grain shape fluid properties interfacial tension and viscosity ratio operating condition water injection velocity and wettability on counter current spontaneous imbibition within a 2d porous medium under ofo they analyzed the characteristics of oil recovery curves and revealed the microscopic mechanisms captured during imbibition including snap off interface coalescence water film bridging and oil film thinning the imbibition behavior influenced by these factors under ofo has also been systematically studied by gu et al 2019 using the color gradient lattice boltzmann model cg lbm the most prominent result they found is that the oil discharged into a fracture in three regimes i e squeezing jetting and dripping regime under the control of the water injection velocity and the interfacial tension parameters using the shan chen lattice boltzmann model sc lbm hatiboglu and babadagli 2008 simulated spontaneous imbibition with ofo and tfo boundary conditions in a 2d porous medium and compared the simulation results with microscopic visualization experiment results they demonstrated that the sc lbm could simulate the effect of gravity and correctly capture the pore scale physical mechanisms during co current and counter current imbibition using a modified sc lbm zheng et al 2018 investigated the spontaneous imbibition behavior of fracturing fluid within the 3d shale matrix with complex pore structure and mixed wettability characteristics the results show that the fracturing fluid is first quickly absorbed into the large pores and then gradually migrates into the hydrophilic nanopores thus leading to a nonuniform menisci propagation there were of course other simulation studies on spontaneous imbibition gunde et al 2013 wiklund and uesaka 2013 xiao et al 2019 however most studies above are mainly based on 2d geometries and focus on imbibition behavior under ofo or and tfo boundary conditions undoubtedly pore scale simulations of spontaneous imbibition in 3d porous media with different boundary conditions can effectively complement these studies in this study by adopting lattice boltzmann simulations the influences of the geometric characteristics of the granular porous medium on spontaneous imbibition performances are investigated under different boundary conditions the organization of the paper is as follows section 2 presents the basic algorithm of the color gradient lattice boltzmann model and the method used to generate the granular porous medium then describes the realization of different imbibition boundary conditions and a detailed simulation setup as well as a model validation case simulation results are presented and discussed in sections 3 and 4 the influences of grain shape and grain packing pattern on imbibition behavior under various boundary conditions are analyzed in detail finally we conclude in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 color gradient lattice boltzmann model in this work an optimized cg lbm with multiple relaxation time mrt scheme was adopted to simulate spontaneous imbibition in granular media toelke et al 2006 in this model three evolution equations for the particle distribution functions are developed to track the momentum transport of the fluid system and the mass transport of each fluid component respectively among them the momentum transport equation is 1 f i r c i δ t t δ t f i r t ω i which describes the evolution of fluid particle distribution function f i r t in discrete time t and discrete space r timm et al 2016 the macroscopic fluid density ρ and velocity u can then be calculated by 2 ρ i f i 3 ρ u i c i f i where c i is the lattice velocity vector and it has the following values for the three dimensional nineteen velocity d3q19 lattice model qian et al 1992 4 c i 0 0 0 i 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 i 1 2 6 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 i 7 8 18 an mrt scheme was adopted as the collision operator to improve the accuracy and stability of the calculations 5 ω m 1 s m m eq where the transformation matrix m is responsible for transforming the fluid particle distribution function into moment space the equilibrium vector m eq contains multiple moments through which the fluid interface tension can be introduced toelke et al 2006 ahrenholz et al 2008 the diagonal matrix s contains multiple relaxation rates e g 19 for d3q19 with them the fluid viscosity can be set but the stability of the numerical calculation can be improved by careful tuning coveney et al 2002 saito et al 2017 for an immiscible fluid system consisting of wetting and nonwetting fluids the two phase fluid components can be indicated by an order parameter ϕ defined as 6 ϕ ρ w ρ nw ρ w ρ nw thus the phase field distribution can be represented by only one parameter calculated from the component densities ρ w and ρ nw i e the order parameter with values of 1 and 1 indicates the bulk phase of wetting and nonwetting fluids respectively while its value between 1 and 1 indicates the diffusion interface based on the phase field distribution the color gradient c used to characterize the interaction between fluid components can be calculated as 7 c r t ϕ 1 c s 2 δ t i ω i c i ϕ r c i δ t t where the weight coefficients w i corresponding to the d3q19 model are given as 8 ω i 1 3 i 0 1 18 i 1 2 6 1 36 i 7 8 18 two other lattice boltzmann equations namely the mass transport equations are introduced to track the component densities φ ρ w ρ nw and their evolution equations are as follows 9 g i r c i δ t t δ t w i φ 1 1 c s 2 c i u the solutions of the mass and momentum transport equations are coupled through the color gradient and the fluid velocity therefore cg lbm can effectively handle the immiscible fluid flow the detailed derivation process of the model and its application to two phase flow in porous media can be found in the work of jiang et al 2014 bakhshian and hosseini 2019 2 2 granular media generation six grain packing models with different grain shapes and packing patterns fig 2 are generated by using the discrete element method dem cundall and strack 1979 all models have similar porosity approximately 0 45 resulting from 600 grains with the same size distribution settling in a square box under gravity s influence all grains within the same model have the same shape but their diameters d follow a normal distribution i e d n μ σ 2 μ 150 σ 30 here we consider two packing patterns i e random and regular packing and three different grain shapes including one spherical and two non spherical irregular shapes irregular grains are obtained by modifying the sphere s surface mesh with varying amplitudes of coherent noise while keeping the volume unchanged for the specific algorithm please refer to the work of al ibrahim et al 2019 to quantitatively describe the shape of the grains we introduced sphericity ψ which is defined as the ratio of the surface area of a sphere having the same volume v p as the grain to the surface area a p of the grain as follows 10 ψ π 1 3 6 v p 2 3 a p sphericity describes how closely a grain resembles a sphere zhou et al 2018 the more similar the shape is to the sphere the closer the value of ψ is to 1 note that the average sphericity of all grains in the same spherical model in this work is 0 991 due to the influence of spatial voxelization the average sphericity of irregularly shaped grains is 0 953 and 0 929 respectively and the smaller its value is the more irregular its shape gets for convenience these three shapes of grains are referred to as sphere nonsphere a and nonsphere b respectively according to their sphericity in descending order to effectively impose imbibition boundary conditions at both ends of the x direction in subsequent simulations we excised some voxels at these ends the models after this treatment are directly used for the spontaneous imbibition simulation with different boundary conditions and their detailed geometrical parameters are given in table 1 2 3 model setup spontaneous imbibition with four boundary conditions shown in fig 3 is simulated based on the above generated grain packing models different boundary conditions are realized by closing and opening some faces of the box shaped media model and putting the open faces in contact with water or oil reservoir for afo imbibition there is only one scenario for each model since the model is surrounded by water however for tfo and tfo free imbibition there can be multiple scenarios due to the relative distribution of the two open faces in this study a scenario where two open faces perpendicular to the x axis is considered in the tfo and tfo free imbibition simulations to simplify the work in addition for the random packing model only the scenario where the water reservoir contacts with the x open face is considered to further simplify the work due to its relatively homogeneous grain distribution therefore spontaneous imbibition with ofo or tfo free boundary conditions in the random packing model corresponds to only one simulation case in contrast both scenarios where the water reservoir contacts with x and x open face are considered for the regular packing model due to significant grain size differences in this direction accordingly ofo x ofo x and tfo free x tfo free x are used in this work to distinguish the different scenarios the water and oil reservoirs in the simulation like fractures underground provide water supply and oil discharge during spontaneous imbibition however previous studies have shown that fracture aperture affects spontaneous imbibition jafari et al 2017 gu et al 2019 in order to exclude such influence the thickness of water and oil reservoirs is set to 0 2 and 0 05 mm respectively in all simulations the boundary conditions used in the spontaneous imbibition simulation are the same as those used in the following capillary filling simulation i e the bounce back boundary condition is imposed at both the pore solid interface and the solid wall while the periodic boundary condition is imposed at both the water and oil reservoir boundaries besides the periodic boundary conditions on the boundary perpendicular to the x axis are also subjected to a particular treatment that is the distribution function that streams into the reservoir is transformed into that of the fluid it contains to ensure an infinite supply of water or a continuous discharge of oil the same fluid system i e water is the wetting fluid dodecane is the nonwetting fluid and the consistent contact angle θ 30 is used in all simulations the specific properties of the fluids used in the simulations are shown in table 1 2 4 model validation capillary filling originated from the pioneering work of lucas 1918 and washburn 1921 is used to validate the ability of cg lbm in simulating spontaneous imbibition in this work suppose the gravity and inertia effects are neglected in that case the wetting fluid filling a capillary tube is controlled by only capillary force and viscous resistance then the capillary filling length l with time t can be expressed by the following equation zhu et al 2016 11 μ w μ n 2 l 2 l 0 2 μ n l l l 0 r σ cos θ 6 t where μ w μ nw is the viscosity of the wetting nonwetting fluid and σ is the interface tension l and r are the length and radius of the capillary tube respectively two capillary tubes both 3 mm in length but with radii of 47 5 and 70 μm respectively are used in capillary filling simulations for the perfect realization of capillary filling on the one hand a water reservoir and an oil reservoir with a length of 1 mm are added to the opposite end of the capillary tube fig 4 a for water supply and oil drainage separately on the other hand periodic boundary conditions are applied to all water and oil reservoirs walls the same fluid systems i e water and dodecane referred to as oil are used in all simulations and their physical properties are shown in table 1 the simulation results and the analytical solutions of capillary filling length fig 4 b are in good agreement proving the accuracy and capacity of the model we used in simulating spontaneous imbibition 3 simulation results 3 1 ofo spontaneous imbibition the oil water interface during spontaneous imbibition with ofo boundary condition can be divided into two parts the imbibition and the drainage interface based on the flow direction gu et al 2019 bakhshian et al 2020 the former is the meniscus formed by the water imbibition into relatively small pores while the latter is the result of oil drainage into the water reservoir movie s1 demonstrates the dynamic evolution of the oil water interface during ofo imbibition for random and regular packing models the drainage interface which formed rapidly at the initial stage is progressively snapped off and a large number of oil droplets are formed in the water reservoir as the drainage interface area decreases the imbibition interface advances slower accordingly and the ofo imbibition eventually reaches a steady state fig 5 shows the oil distribution of ofo imbibition in all models at 1 784 ms and steady state to demonstrate the evolutionary characteristics of drainage and imbibition interfaces by comparing the number and size of the drainage meniscus in fig 5 the drainage interfaces in different models are significantly different horizontally grain shape remains the same while they are more similar vertically grain packing pattern remains the same results indicate that the packing pattern and water reservoir location affect the formation of the drainage interface these two factors essentially change the grains in contact with the water reservoir for different models in other words the grain size distribution on the open face fig 5 from left to right random size relatively uniform large size and small size respectively is essentially responsible for the differences between drainage interfaces there are some differences in the two phase interface morphology and imbibition depth at steady state within different models fig 5 horizontally the two phase interface within the regular packing model under ofo x is extraordinarily irregular and shows a distinct fingering morphology with the most profound imbibition depth in contrast it has a flatter morphology with the shallowest imbibition depth in the regular packing model under ofo x correspondingly these differences in the imbibition interface are more intuitively reflected in the recovery curve fig 6 for models with the same grain shape the imbibition rate and ultimate recovery factor of the random packing model are more significant than that of the regular packing model under ofo x but less than that of the regular packing model under ofo x thus it is illustrated that the grain packing pattern and water reservoir location significantly affect the spontaneous imbibition for models with the same packing pattern the fingering morphology and imbibition depth become more pronounced with decreasing grain sphericity especially in random packing models with nonsphere b grains and regular packing models under ofo x correspondingly it is evident in fig 6 that the model with the more irregular shape has a faster imbibition rate and a higher ultimate recovery factor 3 2 tfo spontaneous imbibition overall the drainage interface evolution in tfo imbibition under the influence of granular media structure fig 7 is more similar to that in ofo imbibition specifically the grain size distribution on the open face rather than the grain shape strongly influences the drainage interface evolution for the same granular media model the drainage interfaces on the same open face during ofo and tfo imbibition are almost identical in terms of morphology number and location of the meniscus as shown in figs 5 and 7 the imbibition behavior at the initial stage under tfo is more like a combination of the counter current imbibition results under ofo x and ofo x therefore these results further demonstrate that the drainage interface evolution is more influenced by the local grain distribution movie s2 demonstrates the tfo imbibition process within random and regular packing pattern models results show that the packing pattern strongly influences the two phase interface evolution during imbibition the drainage interface evolution at the later stage of imbibition influenced by the grain size gradient proceeds mainly on the x open face in the regular packing model while in the random packing model it proceeds simultaneously on both open faces the imbibition interfaces in random packing models initially located on both open faces and subsequently moving towards the model interior have similar morphologies and imbibition depth however the imbibition depth within the regular packing model is significantly deeper on the x side so that the remaining oil is mainly near the x side in addition the imbibition interface evolution is also influenced by the grain shape a distinct fingering morphology is formed in the model with the most irregular grain shape nonsphere b grains a remarkable phenomenon was also observed in the tfo imbibition due to the relatively small pore size near solid walls the imbibition interfaces originating from two open faces meet first near the solid wall and form new interfaces that displace the oil along the other direction this flow characteristic of the imbibition interface is the main feature in the capillary fingering regime the oil recovery curves of tfo imbibition for different models are shown in fig 8 for models with the same packing pattern the more irregular the grain shape the faster the imbibition rate and the higher the ultimate recovery factor for models with the same grain shape the imbibition rate and ultimate recovery factor of the regular packing model are significantly greater than those of the random packing model these differences exhibited by the oil recovery curves directly correspond to the morphological characteristics and imbibition depth of the two phase interface within the different models 3 3 tfo free spontaneous imbibition relative to the imbibition with ofo and tfo boundary conditions the oil droplets formed in tfo free imbibition are relatively small fig 9 although the drainage menisci under these boundaries are more similar in number and location as seen from movie s3 the drainage interface is quickly snapped off and continuous oil production proceeds mainly through the co current flow in contrast the imbibition interface within the regular packing model exhibits significant differences depending on the water reservoir location under tfo free x the imbibition interface exhibits a distinct fingering morphology and the lagging fluid interface is snapped off to form residual oil clusters however under tfo free x the two phase interface as a whole is relatively regular and only the spherical or small residual oil is formed within single or adjacent pores fig 9 this phenomenon is mainly caused by the grain size gradient along the flow direction previous studies have shown that the pore size gradient can trigger or inhibit capillary fingering depending on whether the pore size decreases or increases along the flow direction al housseiny et al 2012 lu et al 2019 for spontaneous imbibition with tfo free x and tfo free x boundary conditions in a regular packing model it is the diverging grain size along the flow direction under tfo free x that leads to a relatively faster imbibition rate and higher ultimate recovery factor fig 10 b however for different models with the same packing pattern and reservoir location their oil recovery curves show almost the same trend as shown in fig 10 a indicating that the grain shape has less influence on the tfo free spontaneous imbibition 3 4 afo spontaneous imbibition due to the significant increase in computational domain size with six water reservoirs the afo imbibition simulations for the random and regular packing models were stopped at 30 and 40 ms based on the oil recovery curves in fig 12 respectively to achieve a reasonable computational resource consumption for spontaneous imbibition with afo boundary condition one of the most remarkable features is that many drainage menisci form quickly and cover all model faces at the initial stage fig 11 for the random packing model the volume of oil droplets on the four surfaces surrounding the x axis is relatively large and these droplets are snapped off first as seen in movie s4 however oil droplets with relatively large volumes are mainly located near the large grains for the regular packing model thus these results suggest that the grain packing pattern influences the formation of the drainage interface to better visualize the remaining oil distribution in the pore space after afo imbibition reaches a steady state all water reservoirs surrounding the medium model are removed and not shown in fig 11 the two phase interface morphology within random and regular packing models with the same grain shape is relatively similar but the remaining oil location is slightly different the remaining oil in the random model occupies the central portion of the model while the remaining oil within the regular model is closer to the end with the large sized grains for models with the same packing pattern the more irregular the grain shape the more pronounced the capillary fingering the imbibition rate for all models in fig 12 is the fastest at the initial 5 ms and slows down rapidly after that correspondingly many drainage menisci are snapped off leaving only one or two drainage menisci to discharge oil slowly during the rapid imbibition stage the recovery curves of the random and regular packing models show similar behavior i e the imbibition rates of the non spherical grain models are closer and they are larger than that of the spherical grain packing model during the slow imbibition stage the recovery curves within the regular packing models show significant differences with the more irregular the grain shape the faster the imbibition rate and the higher the ultimate recovery factor 4 discussion the imbibition performance of the same structure under different boundary conditions is further discussed just like the routine analysis in core scale imbibition experiments fig 13 illustrates the recovery curves of spontaneous imbibition with four different boundary conditions in the random and regular packing models of spherical grains significant differences can be observed among these recovery curves to better describe that the recovery curve is divided into three stages fast slow and steady depending on the imbibition rate for example a rough division of these three stages for the recovery curve under tfo is shown in fig 13a in the fast stage the models with two different packing patterns exhibit the same imbibition performance under different boundary conditions i e the imbibition rates are in the order of afo tfo tfo free ofo from fast to slow the more the water reservoir is added the faster the imbibition rate is at the initial stage besides the duration of the fast imbibition stage varies significantly under different boundaries that is the duration is longest under tfo free while it becomes shorter under afo tfo and ofo sequentially the duration of the slow imbibition stage also varies greatly under different boundaries under afo and tfo free imbibition shifts rapidly to a steady state after fast imbibition and accordingly there is a sharp turn in the recovery curve under tfo the slow stage duration is the longest and the recovery curve of the regular packing model even shows a uniformly increasing trend during this stage the recovery factor after reaching the steady state i e the ultimate recovery factor is also significantly different under different boundary conditions the ultimate recovery factor of random and regular packing models under different boundary conditions is in descending order tfo free afo tfo ofo in summary increasing the number of water reservoirs can significantly increase the imbibition rate at the initial stage while introducing an oil reservoir on the opposing open face can significantly increase the fast imbibition stage duration these two factors together affect the ultimate oil recovery factor fig 14 summarizes the ultimate recovery factor obtained in all simulation cases results show that the ultimate recovery factor under different boundary conditions remains in the same order i e tfo free afo tfo ofo in descending order for all the granular media models used in this work therefore the boundary conditions have the most significant influence on spontaneous imbibition compared to the porous media geometry used in this work besides it is observed that the grain shape affects the ultimate recovery factor to varying degrees under different boundary conditions for the random packing model fig 14 a the difference in the ultimate recovery factor is most pronounced under the ofo and tfo boundary conditions with the more irregular the shape the higher the ultimate recovery factor under both conditions this trend occurs under the ofo x tfo and afo boundary conditions for the regular packing model the above results show in detail the microscopic flow mechanism and imbibition efficiency behind spontaneous imbibition with different boundary conditions which provides some insight into our practical engineering activities since spontaneous imbibition is a two phase flow completely dominated by capillary forces the fluid interface evolution during fluid flow directly determines the overall imbibition performance however the two phase interface evolution during spontaneous imbibition may play a dual role simultaneously i e the imbibition interface and the drainage interface whose capillary forces provide the driving force and resistance to fluid flow respectively therefore the factors affecting the spontaneous imbibition performance are rooted in those affecting the distribution of imbibition and drainage interfaces these factors include the boundary condition which determines the two phase interface distribution at the initial moments of imbibition and the porous media structure which determines the imbibition and drainage interface distribution and the difference between their capillary force magnitudes there is no doubt that a larger imbibition interface contributes to a higher imbibition efficiency while a more significant difference in capillary forces between the imbibition and drainage interfaces contributes to a longer imbibition duration and these two factors together determine the ultimate recovery factor therefore in practical engineering activities such as waterflooding development of fractured reservoirs we should make the fractured rock matrix in the reservoir as much as possible in a scenario favorable to spontaneous imbibition so that the two phase interface serves almost completely as imbibition interface just like the spontaneous imbibition with the tfo free boundary condition in order to enhance oil recovery 5 conclusions in this work using an optimized color gradient lattice boltzmann model we investigated the influence of geometric features of granular media including grain shape and packing pattern on spontaneous imbibition under four different boundary conditions the main findings are summarized as follows 1 the influence of grain shape on the imbibition interface evolution and oil recovery factor is strong for counter current spontaneous imbibition but relatively weak for co current spontaneous imbibition for spontaneous imbibition with ofo tfo and afo boundary conditions the more irregular the grain shape is the more pronounced the imbibition interface s fingering morphology gets then the deeper the imbibition depth becomes and correspondingly the higher value the oil recovery factor has however under all boundary conditions applied in this work the grain shape has less influence on the drainage at the initial stage 2 the grain packing pattern influences the two phase interface evolution and the recovery factor the grain size distribution on the open face owing to different grain packing patterns results in some differences in the number and size of the drainage meniscus at the initial stage between the random and regular packing models the grain size gradient along the x direction in the regular packing pattern makes the imbibition interface evolution during tfo and afo imbibition of this model easier at the x side so that the imbibition interface on that side has a pronounced fingering morphology and deep imbibition depth 3 boundary conditions compared to the geometric features used in this work have the greatest influence on the spontaneous imbibition performance so the recovery curve characteristics vary greatly for different boundary conditions the larger the open face in contact with water is the higher the imbibition rate becomes so that spontaneous imbibition with the afo boundary condition has the highest imbibition rate due to the long duration of the rapid imbibition stage under the tfo free boundary condition the ultimate recovery factor is the highest under this condition this work provides pore scale insights into the dynamic fluid displacement mechanism during spontaneous imbibition however the inherent characteristics of granular porous media such as large porosity and good connectivity make them far from comparable to the complex pore structure in actual reservoirs with the help of high precision imaging techniques such as micro computed tomography and dual beam electron microscopy more future work can focus on the detailed spontaneous imbibition behavior within low permeability and tight reservoirs credit authorship contribution statement yang liu

3544,rainfall represents the main driving force of runoff and soil erosion previous studies usually focused on the effects of general rainfall characteristics at event scale on runoff and soil erosion but the effects of rainfall intensity fluctuation at intra event scale i e the temporal distribution of intensity bursts across the rainfall profile have always been difficult to be characterized in this study the rainfall intensity profile was disaggregated into high intensity zone and low intensity zone using the average rainfall intensity as threshold and a series of indicators were proposed to describe the features of rainfall intensity fluctuation field observations of runoff and soil loss in six grass cover plots under natural rainfall conditions were conducted from 2011 to 2016 in the loess plateau of china the main rainfall indicators influencing runoff coefficient rc sediment concentration sc and soil loss coefficient slc were identified using the principal component analysis and runoff and soil loss regression models were developed using data from 2011 to 2013 to predict rc sc and slc during 2014 2016 the results indicated that the natural rainfall events displayed strong intensity fluctuations e g aggregation intermittency and variability with approximate 78 of rainfall amount occurring in only 27 of rainfall duration most of the proposed rainfall intensity fluctuation indicators were significantly correlated with rc sc and slc p 0 05 the average intensity of rainfall peaks iap and rainfall duration of high intensity zone rdh were the main variables to simulate rc and the average intensity of high intensity zone iah and relative amplitude of rainfall intensity ram controlled sc and slc the models considering rainfall intensity fluctuation had good performances in predicting rc sc and slc with higher r 2 values 0 64 vs 0 46 lower rmse values 0 66 vs 0 76 and higher nse values 0 54 vs 0 42 compared to the models only considering general rainfall characteristics the prediction accuracy of slc was higher than that of rc and that of sc was lowest these results gain an insight into the marked influence of rainfall intensity fluctuation in generating and predicting runoff and soil loss and shed light on exploring rainfall erosion relationships keywords natural rainfall runoff and soil erosion rainfall intensity fluctuation intra event scale model simulation 1 introduction soil erosion causes serious environmental problems worldwide such as land degradation crop productivity reduction and destruction of ecosystem services panagos et al 2018 rainfall represents the main driving force of soil erosion rainfall characteristics at event scale such as the total rainfall amount ra rainfall duration rd average intensity ia maximum intensity over a certain period e g 5 min i5 10 min i10 and 30 min i30 and the rainfall erosivity factor ei30 are often used to study the effects of rainfall events on runoff and soil loss valmis et al 2005 mohamadi and kavian 2015 wang et al 2016 however natural rainfall events usually show frequent intensity fluctuations at intra event scale i e the temporal distribution of rainfall intensity peaks bursts in the rainfall profile which have important influences on hydrological processes frauenfeld and truman 2004 dunkerley 2012 orchard et al 2013 todisco 2014 wang et al 2017 some studies have found that the rainfall events characterized by similar general properties e g ra rd ia i5 i10 i30 ei30 etc could produce greatly different amounts of runoff and soil loss and they proposed that these phenomena were likely due to the influence of rainfall intensity fluctuation dunkerley 2012 todisco 2014 dunkerley 2015 mohamadi and kavian 2015 the features of rainfall intensity fluctuation included the timing of the most intense period of rainfall e g early peak centre peak and late peak patterns intra storm variations in intensity e g increasing decreasing and their mixed models intermittency no rain intervals between intensity peaks the values of intensity peaks and the number and distribution of rainfall peaks including secondary peaks parsons and stone 2006 dunkerley 2012 todisco 2014 dunkerley 2015 the rainfall intensity fluctuation features were generally considered to exert an important influence on hydrological and erosive processes which has become increasingly concerned in studies of runoff and soil loss parsons and stone 2006 dunkerley 2012 tao et al 2017 it was found that rainfall intensity fluctuation resulted in variability of infiltration rates and peak of runoff subsequently influenced the amount of runoff from bare land dunkerley 2012 frauenfeld and truman 2004 indicated that simulated rainfall events with varying intensity iv resulted in 28 more runoff and 32 more soil loss from bare land compared to the rainfall events with constant intensity ic before the occurrence of the maximum intensity peak parsons and stone 2006 conducted simulated rainstorms to explore the effects of rainfall intensity fluctuation on inter rill erosion in bare land under different soil types and they found that soil loss of ic events only accounted for 75 of that from iv events with iv events transporting sediment with higher clay contents and lower sand contents than that transported by ic events mohamadi and kavian 2015 measured the runoff and soil loss in field pasture land under natural rainfall events and concluded that rainfall events with increasing rainfall intensity yielded 1 5 to 4 9 times higher surface runoff and 1 7 to 3 9 times larger soil loss than those of other rainfall patterns wang et al 2016 suggested the rainfall pattern with rainfall amount concentrated in the later period generated 1 5 to 6 times larger soil loss from bare land compared to other patterns based on field monitoring additionally the occurring period of the maximum intensity in the rainfall profile also acted as an important factor in producing runoff and soil loss dunkerley 2012 and flanagan et al 1988 showed that the runoff and soil loss rates in bare land from late peaking storms under simulated rainfall experiments were 1 43 3 85 and 1 50 to 8 50 times larger than those from uniform or early peaking storms however römkens et al 2001 demonstrated that the rainfall events with early peaks produced 1 41 times more soil loss compared to those with late peaks in bare soil based on simulated rainfall experiments some indicators have been proposed to quantify rainfall intensity fluctuation and their relationships with runoff and soil loss were investigated dunkerley 2015 proposed the intra event rainfall intermittency ieri within rainfall events according to a rainfall intensity threshold and suggested that the rainfall events with large ieri might eliminate the surface ponding and recover the infiltrability capacity which facilitated the transformation of rainfall into infiltration consequently decreasing the overland flow todisco 2014 defined the rainfall bursts peaks using a threshold rainfall rate and employed the characteristics of rainfall peaks to recognize the erosive events in cultivated fallow based on pluviograph records field monitoring also found that every intensity burst during a natural rainfall event would lead to the corresponding peak of surface runoff and sediment from coal mining refuse site smith and olyphant 1994 dunkerley 2020 proposed an index to describe rainfall amount in wettest 5 rainfall duration edf5 and the edf5 might play a more important role in erosive processes compared to i30 it can be found that most of previous studies investigated the relationships between rainfall intensity fluctuation and runoff and soil erosion by the simulated rainfall experiments under bare land however rainfall simulations often set one or several fixed rainfall intensity for a specific event or establish different rainfall patterns by tuning several intensity peaks and this synthetic procedure might not fully reflect the complexity of natural rainfall intensity fluctuation although some indices have been established to characterize rainfall intensity fluctuation whereas these indices have not comprehensively quantified the detailed characteristics of rainfall intensity fluctuation and they usually failed to take account of the effects of bursts within rainfall events on hydrological processes solid indicators are needed to capture the intensity fluctuation characteristics of natural rainfall events and investigate their quantitative relationships with soil erosion response variables under restoration vegetation which is the motivation of the work presented in this paper in this study field observations of runoff and soil loss of restoration vegetation under natural rainfall conditions were conducted from 2011 to 2016 in the loess plateau of china the objectives of this study were 1 to propose a series of indicators to describe the complex features of rainfall intensity fluctuation 2 to quantify the relationships between rainfall intensity fluctuation indicators and runoff and soil loss and 3 to develop regression models with consideration of rainfall intensity fluctuation to predict runoff and soil loss 2 indicators of rainfall intensity fluctuation in contrast to the simulated rainfall events with uniform intensity pattern the intensity profiles of natural rainfall events consist of multiple intensity bursts in this study rainfall depth was measured by the tipping bucket rain gauge and the temporal resolution was the time interval under one tip fig 1 is the schematic diagram of rainfall intensity profile of one event and it represents the general form of erosive rainfall events for the study area the average intensity ia was used to disaggregate a rainfall event into high intensity zone and low intensity zone with intensities larger and lower than ia respectively fig 1 the intensity peak was defined as the intensity of burst which was larger than the former and later instantaneous intensity a series of indicators are proposed to describe the features of rainfall intensity fluctuation first we quantified the general rainfall characteristics of the high intensity zone such as the rainfall depth rah duration rdh and average intensity iah due to the critical role of intensity peaks the average intensity of varying peaks iap was also established in addition to above characteristics of the high intensity zone some indicators to describe relative fluctuation features of the whole rainfall event were also proposed for example the fraction of duration in low intensity zone fdl the fraction of rainfall amount in high intensity zone fah the relative amplitude of rainfall intensity ram and the relative number of rainfall peaks n table 1 lists all the rainfall indices and their definitions the rah and rdh are the rainfall amount and rainfall duration in the high intensity zone with the average intensity of iah which was calculated as 1 i ah r a h r d h the average intensity of rainfall peaks iap is the average value of all intensity peaks in high intensity zone 2 i ap i 1 n i peak i n where ipeak i is the intensity of the ith rainfall peak in high intensity zone mm min 1 i 1 2 3 n and n is the number of rainfall peaks the fraction of duration in low intensity zone fdl is calculated as the fraction of rainfall duration in low intensity zone to that of the whole rainfall event 3 f dl 1 r d h rd the fraction of rainfall amount in high intensity zone fah indicates the rainfall concentration degree and it was calculated as the fraction of rainfall amount in high intensity zone to that of the whole rainfall event 4 f ah r a h ra the relative amplitude of rainfall intensity ram was defined as the maximum variation in rainfall intensity relative to ia it indicates the magnitude of the relative amplitude between the maximum and minimum rainfall intensity which was calculated as 5 r am i max i

and it was calculated as 6 n n rd 3 materials and methods 3 1 study area this study was conducted in the yangjuangou catchment 36 42 n 109 31 e which is located in the central region of the loess plateau shaanxi province china fig 2 the catchment has a total area of 2 02 km2 with an elevation ranging from 1050 to 1298 m it is a typical semi arid area with an average annual precipitation of 536 mm varying from 330 to 959 mm during 1951 to 2016 the average annual air temperature is 9 4 c with average values in july and january of 22 9 and 6 5 c respectively the rainfall is mainly concentrated between june and september more than 70 of total annual precipitation and has large inter annual variations with coefficient of variation cv of approximately 30 the soil is a calcaric cambisol with a maximum depth of approximately 200 m it had a uniform texture and was easily erodible the dominant vegetation in the catchment consists of replanted vegetation due to the grain for green project launched in 1998 plant species include robinia pseudoacacia prunus armeniaca artemisia sacrorum stipa bungeana and artemisia scoparia this catchment is a typical region suffering from severe soil erosion with the mean rate of 90 42 t ha 1 y 1 during 1980 1990 62 73 t ha 1 y 1 in 1992 1996 and 32 70 t ha 1 y 1 in 2014 most of soil erosion is produced by several rainstorms in the rainy season 3 2 field experiments six replicate runoff plots of 3 m 10 m were established in grass cover replanted with artemisia sacrorum and stipa bungeana to measure runoff and soil loss during 2011 2016 fig 2 the plots had similar slope gradient of approximately 22 24 and similar slope aspect of northeast the pvc material sheets at a depth of 30 cm were used as the boundaries of runoff plots to prevent surface water flowing from lateral seepage during rainfall a steel collection system consisting of gutter plastic pipe and water containers was installed at the bottom boundary of each plot to collect event runoff and sediment rainfall depth was measured by a tipping bucket rain gauge rg3 m onset computer corp bourne ma usa with the resolution of 0 2 mm the rainfall amount under one tip the rainfall events were separated by the interval more than 6 h between two consecutive rainy periods which was widely used in separating rainfall events huff 1967 if one rainfall event generated runoff this rainfall event was recognized as erosive rainfall event the instantaneous rainfall intensity was calculated through dividing 0 2 mm by the duration between successive tips and subsequently the rainfall intensity profile of an event was obtained the runoff mixed with the sediment discharged from each plot was collected after each rainfall event and the volume was measured after settling for 24 h sediment was separated from water sediment from the gutter was also collected the collected sediment was first air dried for more than 24 h and dried in an oven at a temperature of 105 c for longer than 8 h until constant weight was achieved there were total twenty nine erosive rainfall events during the study period with fourteen and fifteen events during 2011 2013 and 2014 2016 respectively 3 3 data analysis in order to evaluate the impact of rainfall intensity fluctuation on runoff and soil loss the runoff coefficient rc sediment concentration sc and soil loss coefficient slc were employed as erosive response variables in this study and the effect of rainfall amount variability among events can be eliminated the rc was calculated as the ratio of runoff depth to rainfall amount the sc referred to the average sediment concentration of an erosive rainfall event g cm 3 which was calculated by the ratio of soil loss amount and runoff volume the slc was defined as the sediment yield in unit area induced by unit rainfall amount g m 2 mm 1 which could substantially demonstrate the effects of rainfall intensity fluctuation excluding the effects of rainfall amount the rc and slc reflected the ability of rainfall to produce runoff and soil loss respectively the sc revealed the ability of runoff to generate soil loss there were some variations in dependent variables rc sc and slc among the six replicate runoff plots under same erosive rainfall event however the variations were mostly tiny and the differences of land surface factors among the plots were difficult to be fully eliminated the average values for the six plots could mostly represent the actual magnitude of runoff and soil loss hence the rc sc and slc used in the study were the average values of the six plots a logarithmic transformation was applied to all variables due to their abnormal distributions then a pearson correlation matrix was conducted to analyse the relationships between all rainfall parameters and rc sc and slc the pca principal component analysis method was used to transform rainfall parameters into principal components pcs which were employed further in stepwise regression analysis abdul wahab et al 2005 then each pc in the regression equations was replaced by corresponding variable with the highest interpretation abdul wahab et al 2005 and the relationships between the erosion response variables rc sc and slc and rainfall parameters were quantified the runoff sediment concentration and soil loss regression models that considered rainfall intensity fluctuation were called rmf scmf and slmf respectively only the fitting results cannot fully reflect the performance of a regression model and the developed models need to be validated thus the observed data has been divided into two parts for fitting and validating the regression models the observed data from 2011 to 2013 was used to establish regression models and then the observed rainfall data from 2014 to 2016 was used to predict erosion variables the prediction ability is an important aspect for evaluating the applicability of a model both the fitting and predicting results of the developed models were evaluated in this study in addition we also established the relationships between erosive response variables rc sc and slc and general rainfall parameters ra rd ia i30 using stepwise regression analysis mentioned above the original runoff sediment concentration and soil loss regression models that did not consider rainfall intensity fluctuation indicators were called rmo scmo and slmo respectively the determination coefficient r 2 root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were applied to evaluate the validity and prediction accuracy of the models kinnell 2017 additionally a new model comparison index mci developed by kinnell 2016 was employed to directly compare the validity of different models the r 2 rmse nse and mci were calculated using the following equations 7 r 2 j 1 m p j o 2 j 1 m o j o 2 8 rmse 1 m j 1 m o j p j 2 9 nse 1 j 1 m o j p j 2 j 1 m o j o 2 10 mci 1 j 1 m o j p f j 2 j 1 m o j p o j 2 where m is the

are the predicted values by rmf or scmf slmf and rmo or scmo slmo respectively the higher r 2 lower rmse and higher nse values the better the goodness of simulation a value of 1 for nse indicates a perfect match of observed and predicted data negative values of mci indicated rmf scmf and slmf were less effective than rmo scmo and slmo and vice versa if the two types of models had the same efficiency in prediction the mci was equal to zero and it ranged to 1 if the rmf scmf and slmf were perfect 4 results 4 1 rainfall characteristics the twelve rainfall parameters of the twenty nine erosive rainfall events from 2011 to 2016 are shown in table 2 and fig 3 the ra of each rainfall event ranged from 4 00 to 91 60 mm with an average value of 31 74 mm and the rd was in the range of 24 63 to 3122 45 min with an average value of 1096 21 min the ia and i30 varied from 0 01 to 0 23 mm min 1 0 45 to 13 64 mm h 1 and from 0 03 to 0 70 mm min 1 1 98 to 42 00 mm h 1 with average values of 0 04 and 0 23 mm min 1 2 55 to 13 83 mm h 1 respectively the ra rd ia and i30 values varied by several orders of magnitude indicating that the erosive rainfall events represented a wide range of rainfall conditions as shown in table 2 the rah ranged from 3 40 to 71 20 mm with an average value of 24 52 mm which accounted for approximately 59 94 of the ra based on the fah index the rdh ranged from 8 05 to 973 58 min with the mean value of 297 61 min and it only accounted for 10 44 of the rd the rainfall duration in low intensity zone accounted for 56 90 of the total rainfall duration according to the fdl index indicating that the duration of low intensity zone was much longer than rdh consequently approximately 78 of rainfall amount dropped in less than 27 of the total duration of rainfall event the iah and iap were approximately four and eight times larger than the ia with mean values of 0 13 and 0 32 mm min 1 7 96 to 19 16 mm h 1 respectively the order of the four intensity indices is iap i30 iah and ia the ram 2 82 to 84 44 and n 0 01 to 0 28 both showed large ranges indicating the strong variability of rainfall intensity fluctuation among rainfall events 4 2 event runoff sediment concentration and soil loss the rc sc and slc among rainfall events were highly variable with the cv of 3 20 1 64 and 1 86 respectively as evident from fig 4 the rc ranged from 0 003 to 2 771 with the mean of 0 44 and the sc varied from 0 11 to 40 28 kg m 3 with the mean of 5 61 kg m 3 the slc was within the ranges of 0 001 to 1 10 g m 2 mm 1 with the mean of 0 08 g m 2 mm 1 the sc and slc of several erosive rainfall events 13th 15th 16th 17th and 29th were so small that can be ignored the 5th 19th and 28th events produced the largest rc 2 741 2 744 and 2 771 respectively and the 5th and 28th events showed the largest sc 40 28 and 23 73 kg m 3 respectively and slc 1 10 and 0 66 g m 2 mm 1 respectively according to fig 3 the 5th 1 39 mm min 1 83 47 mm h 1 and 28th 0 91 mm min 1 54 86 mm h 1 events had the larger iap than other events and the fdl 0 90 and fah 0 94 of the 5th event were highest among the 29 erosive rainfall events furthermore there was strong correlations between event soil loss and runoff amount as shown in fig 5 the slc first sharply increased and then approached an asymptotic value with the increase of rc which could be described as a power function r 2 0 80 p 0 01 4 3 main rainfall characteristics influencing runoff sediment concentration and soil loss table 3 shows the pearson correlation analysis between erosion variables and rainfall parameters there were three rainfall parameters ra rd and rah showing non significant correlations with rc sc and slc p 0 05 the i30 iah iap and ram were significantly correlated with rc sc

the fah was only significantly correlated with sc p 0 05 most of the rainfall parameters had positive correlations with rc and slc except the two duration characteristics rd and rdh as shown in table 3 among the twelve rainfall parameters the iap had the strongest significant correlation with rc r 0 77 sc r 0 59 and slc r 0 80 followed by i30 r 0 70 0 45 and 0 66 respectively and then iah r 0 67 0

significantly related rainfall parameters ia i30 rdh iah iap fdl ram n the first two pcs accounted for more than 85 of the total variation with eigenvalues greater than 1 the iap iah and i30 had high loadings in pc1 0 8 accounting for 55 of the total variation the pc2 accounted for nearly 30 of the total variation with n and ia having high loadings in pc3 pc4 and pc5 the variables with the highest loadings were rdh ram and fdl respectively and they explained about 14 of the total variation table 5 shows the pcs with rotated factor loadings for sc based on the five significantly related rainfall

of the total variation the pc2 accounted for nearly 20 of the total variation with ram having highest loadings the pc3 accounted for nearly 7 4 of the total variation with fah having highest loadings the rest of pcs did not have any variables with high loadings and accounted for little of the total variation 1 table 6 shows the pcs with rotated factor loadings for slc based on the five significantly related rainfall parameters ia i30 iap fdl ram only the first pc had eigenvalue greater than 1 and accounted for more than 70 of the total variation with iah i30 and iap having high

accounted for little of the total variation approximately 1 4 4 simulation of runoff and soil loss 4 4 1 regression models of runoff and soil loss based on the above regression analyses with pcs the inverse transformation was essential to obtain the relationships between log rc log sc and log slc with the rainfall parameters the iap and rdh were selected to describe rc and the iah and ram were employed to control sc and slc based on the pca the multiple regression models for predicting runoff sediment concentration and soil loss with consideration of rainfall intensity fluctuation rmf scmf

rmf scmf and slmf had higher r 2 values 0 74 0 62 and 0 87 lower rmse values 0 25 0 31 and 0 32 and higher nse values 0 74 0 61 and 0 85 for rc sc and slc simulations compared to rmo scmo and slmo r 2

more accurate simulated values and they were appreciably better than the rmo scmo and slmo we have also developed the runoff and soil loss regression models using the data of the whole 6 years it was found that the rmf scmf and slmf also gained better simulation results than the rmo scmo and slmo table s1 figs s1 s3 4 4 2 prediction of runoff and soil loss fig 9 fig 10 and fig 11 show the comparisons between the observed and predicted values of rc sc and slc during 2014 2016 by above established regression models respectively the performances of the rmf scmf and slmf in predicting rc sc and slc were more satisfactory than those of the rmo scmo and slmo the distributions of data points in fig 9a fig 10a and fig 11a predicted by rmf scmf and slmf were closer to the 1 1 line with lower scatter than those in fig 9b fig 10b and fig 11b predicted by rmo scmo and slmo respectively this was also supported by the higher r 2 values 0 73 0 40 and 0 78 lower rmse values 0 56 0 58 and 0

the prediction accuracy of slc was higher than that of rc and that of sc was lowest as indicated by the model performance evaluation criteria in table 7 it can be found from figs 9 11 that the rmf scmf and slmf somewhat overestimated the low rc sc and slc events the rmo scmo and slmo much overestimated the low rc sc and slc events and they also underestimated the high rc sc and slc events the prediction error of the rmf scmf and slmf were much lower than those of the rmo scmo and slmo 5 discussion 5 1 effects of rainfall intensity fluctuation on runoff and soil loss previous studies have already adopted some indicators to represent rainfall intensity fluctuation such as the intra event rainfall intermittency within rainfall profile proposed by dunkerley 2015 however the detailed characteristics during rain period which played a crucial role in the surface runoff and soil erosion were not considered in dunkerley 2015 as the indicators in previous studies mostly described the limited feature of intensity fluctuation within rainfall events this study proposed abundant rainfall indicators to substantially reveal the properties of rainfall intensity fluctuation for this purpose the rainfall event was disaggregated into high intensity zone and low intensity zone based on ia and the general and relative characteristics of high intensity zone has been described in detail using the indicators rah rdh iah and fdl fah furthermore the iap and n were proposed to further describe the magnitude and frequency of intensity peaks within the rainfall profile respectively in addition we also used the ram to describe the relative amplitude of rainfall intensity during a rainfall event in summary the proposed rainfall indicators in this study comprehensively quantified the general and relative features of rainfall intensity fluctuation within a natural rainfall event which further advanced the researches concerning rainfall intensity fluctuation in this study most of the proposed rainfall intensity fluctuation indicators e g iah iap fdl rdh and ram were significantly correlated with the rc sc and slc whereas in the general rainfall parameters only the i30 exhibited significant correlations with erosive variables table 3 the proposed rainfall indicators not only captured the features of intensity fluctuation of natural rainfall events and they were also significantly related to the rc sc and slc hence the indicators of rainfall intensity fluctuation should be combined with the general rainfall parameters to explore the effects of rainfall on runoff and soil loss parsons and stone 2006 dunkerley 2012 dunkerley 2018 dunkerley 2019 the rainfall peaks within a rainfall event would accelerate the processes of air entrapment ephemeral ponding splash detachment and soil aggregate breakdown gao et al 2003 ewane and lee 2016 dunkerley 2019 which consequently restricted infiltration rates and induced corresponding peaks of runoff and soil loss rates ultimately leading to greater runoff depth and soil loss flanagan 1988 smith and olyphant 1994 dunkerley 2012 dunkerley 2019 the iap proposed in this study described the magnitude of average rainfall peaks and it had the highest positive correlations with rc sc and slc among the rainfall indicators table 3 furthermore the 5th and 28th events which had the highest iap produced the highest rc sc and slc among the events figs 3 and 4 the iah described the magnitude of average rainfall intensity in high intensity zone and it played the similar role as iap the ram described the relative magnitude of maximum rainfall peak in the intensity profile and it can be found that the 5th and 28th events had high ram fig 3 the high rdh indicated that average rainfall intensity in high intensity zone was relatively low under certain rainfall amount and thus it was negatively correlated with runoff and soil loss which was further supported by the fact that the 5th and 28th events had relatively low rdh fig 3 the high iap iah ram and low rdh are the main features of rainstorms which are critical for producing runoff and soil loss in the study area and these four factors were selected to simulate runoff and soil loss in this study it should be noted that the effects of rainfall intensity fluctuation on runoff and soil loss may depend on the size of the plot the steepness of plot and the type of soil and vegetation cover dunkerley 2020 the rainfall intensity fluctuation may become less important as scale increases and the gently sloping sites with high infiltration capacity might show less effect of intensity fluctuations in addition the main indicators of rainfall intensity fluctuation controlling runoff and soil loss may be changeable among different land use cover therefore additional field work is needed to collect more data and determine the main rainfall parameters and compare the varying relationships between rainfall intensity fluctuation and runoff and soil loss under different land surface conditions 5 2 runoff and soil loss models considering rainfall intensity fluctuation the runoff and soil loss models using general rainfall parameters mostly overlooked the considerable effects of rainfall intensity fluctuation on generating runoff and soil loss ultimately decreasing the prediction capacity of runoff and soil loss parsons and stone 2006 dunkerley 2012 dunkerley 2019 in contrast the models considering the rainfall intensity fluctuation rmf scmf and slmf showed better performances in predicting rc sc and slc compared to the models using general rainfall parameters rmo scmo and slmo in this study table 7 however there were some estimation errors between observed and predicted runoff and soil loss by rmf scmf and slmf i e overestimation of the low rc sc and slc events this might be due to that the rmf scmf and slmf were statistical models which only considered the rainfall characteristics and they neglected the impacts of land surface factors e g vegetation cover antecedent soil wetness and topography on the processes of runoff generation and soil erosion furthermore some features of rainfall intensity fluctuation should be incorporated in the model for example the location of intensity peaks early peak late peak etc number of most intense peaks and intensity peak prominence within rainfall events if an intensity peak arrives toward the end of an event when the soil has already become wet it may drive more runoff deeper and faster so more erosive than if the same peak had arrived near the beginning of the event the most intense peaks might offer useful predictive power rather than all peaks since some only exceed the mean rainfall intensity by a tiny amount peak prominence is probably effective in capturing the ongoing intensity dynamics not in respect to an average rainfall but to the peak boundary conditions the matlab findpeaks function can return prominence values so as to identify very severe peaks from more normal ones it should be noted that the regression runoff and soil loss models considering the rainfall intensity fluctuation may depend on the intensity threshold to disaggregate the rainfall event besides the ia the medium rainfall intensity im is also a choice to quantify the high intensity zone and low intensity zone furthermore from the perspective of soil capacity to accept rainfall and produce runoff the average infiltration rate of soil if can be also considered as a threshold to disaggregate the rainfall event i e the rainfall intensity over if as high intensity and below if as the low intensity to determine the reasonable threshold the performances of regression runoff and soil loss models using different thresholds ia im and if were compared see appendix a the results showed that the models employing the ia as threshold exhibited better simulation performances compared to other thresholds as a consequence the average rainfall intensity should be chosen as suitable threshold for disaggregating the rainfall events in this study the rainfall profile can be also divided into low 0 25th quantile medium 25th 75th quantile and high 75th 100th quantile intensity zones or a third for each dunkerley 2019 todisco et al 2019 in this case numerous indicators are needed to characterize the rainfall intensity fluctuation furthermore a period of no rain for 6 h was considered to separate rainfall events in this study the rainfall events can be divided into erosive storms and non erosive storms from pluviograph as proposed by todisco 2014 thus how to divide the rainfall profile and how to divide the rainfall events can also influence the effects of rainfall intensity fluctuation on runoff and soil loss which is the next step in our investigation rainfall is the main driving force of runoff and soil erosion and runoff has direct effect on event soil loss the soil loss prediction models incorporating the runoff as primary indicator could improve the model performance kinnell 2016 2017 this study also indicated that the event soil loss coefficient had a good power function with runoff coefficient however it is difficult to widely collect runoff data in field experiments due to economic and human input especially under the complex terrain in contrast to the much more input to obtain runoff data the collection of instantaneous rainfall intensity data is much easy using recording rain gauges furthermore the accuracy of regression model in predicting soil loss coefficient was higher than that of runoff coefficient and that of sediment concentration was lowest in this study thus the approach to simulate soil loss by predicting the runoff then sediment concentration may have great uncertainties hence employing the rainfall intensity fluctuation to predict the soil loss seems to be a more practical approach to improve the prediction accuracy of runoff and soil loss further studies are needed to incorporate rainfall intensity fluctuation characteristics into physical runoff and soil erosion models with considering the roles of both rainfall characteristics and land surface factors in generation of runoff and soil erosion tao et al 2017 used a modified kinematic wave equation to accurately simulate runoff and sediment rates with rainfall fluctuation patterns todisco 2014 proposed that using new rainfall erosivity factors in usle rusle models which considered rainfall intensity fluctuation might be an effective way to improve predictions of soil erosion with respect to the usle rusle models the rainfall erosivity factor ei30 only partially involved rainfall fluctuation when calculating the rainfall kinetic energy e while i30 had little information of rainfall intensity fluctuation wang et al 2014 wang et al 2016 in this study we found that iap incorporated more intensity fluctuation information and it was closely related to runoff and soil loss therefore the iap as well as other dimensionless indicators of rainfall fluctuation features could be employed to develop a new rainfall erosivity factor and established the modified usle rusle models in addition the runoff was considered as the primary impacting factor of the soil loss both the rainfall intensity fluctuation and runoff factors could be employed in the usle rusle models to predict soil loss on hillslopes the developed modified models should be tested under different land use types and geomorphic features 6 conclusions in this study a series of rainfall indicators describing the characteristics of rainfall intensity fluctuation were proposed and the regression models between runoff and soil loss with the proposed rainfall indicators were established the natural rainfall events displayed strong intensity fluctuations e g aggregation intermittency and variability most of the rainfall intensity fluctuation indicators were significantly correlated with runoff sediment concentration and soil loss the iap and rdh primarily controlled runoff and iah and ram controlled sediment concentration and soil erosion the performances of regression models considering rainfall intensity fluctuation was more satisfactory in predicting runoff and soil loss compared to those which only considered general rainfall indicators additionally the established models were better in predicting soil erosion compared to runoff and sediment concentration in summary the first novelty of this study is that the proposed rainfall indicators could describe the complex features of intensity fluctuation of natural rainfall and they better accounted for bursts of rainfall on runoff and soil loss than the general rainfall parameters second the regression models considering rainfall intensity fluctuation had good performances in predicting runoff and soil loss and they can be of practical use as they only need the instantaneous rainfall intensity data which can be easily observed however the obtained results in this study were verified only under grassland in the loess plateau the proposed rainfall indicators and developed models should be further evaluated under different climatic land use cover soil properties and

the regression models with if and im as disaggregating thresholds even had negative mci values in prediction table s2 which indicated the prediction performances of these models were worse than the original regression models as shown in figs s4 s9 the data points simulated by the regression models with if and im as disaggregating thresholds had larger scatter around the 1 1 line compared to the

3544,rainfall represents the main driving force of runoff and soil erosion previous studies usually focused on the effects of general rainfall characteristics at event scale on runoff and soil erosion but the effects of rainfall intensity fluctuation at intra event scale i e the temporal distribution of intensity bursts across the rainfall profile have always been difficult to be characterized in this study the rainfall intensity profile was disaggregated into high intensity zone and low intensity zone using the average rainfall intensity as threshold and a series of indicators were proposed to describe the features of rainfall intensity fluctuation field observations of runoff and soil loss in six grass cover plots under natural rainfall conditions were conducted from 2011 to 2016 in the loess plateau of china the main rainfall indicators influencing runoff coefficient rc sediment concentration sc and soil loss coefficient slc were identified using the principal component analysis and runoff and soil loss regression models were developed using data from 2011 to 2013 to predict rc sc and slc during 2014 2016 the results indicated that the natural rainfall events displayed strong intensity fluctuations e g aggregation intermittency and variability with approximate 78 of rainfall amount occurring in only 27 of rainfall duration most of the proposed rainfall intensity fluctuation indicators were significantly correlated with rc sc and slc p 0 05 the average intensity of rainfall peaks iap and rainfall duration of high intensity zone rdh were the main variables to simulate rc and the average intensity of high intensity zone iah and relative amplitude of rainfall intensity ram controlled sc and slc the models considering rainfall intensity fluctuation had good performances in predicting rc sc and slc with higher r 2 values 0 64 vs 0 46 lower rmse values 0 66 vs 0 76 and higher nse values 0 54 vs 0 42 compared to the models only considering general rainfall characteristics the prediction accuracy of slc was higher than that of rc and that of sc was lowest these results gain an insight into the marked influence of rainfall intensity fluctuation in generating and predicting runoff and soil loss and shed light on exploring rainfall erosion relationships keywords natural rainfall runoff and soil erosion rainfall intensity fluctuation intra event

al 2018 rainfall represents the main driving force of soil erosion rainfall characteristics at event scale such as the total rainfall amount ra rainfall duration rd average intensity ia maximum intensity over a certain period e g 5 min i5 10 min i10 and 30 min i30 and the rainfall erosivity factor ei30 are often used to study the effects of rainfall events on runoff and soil loss valmis et al 2005 mohamadi and kavian 2015 wang et al 2016 however natural rainfall events usually show frequent intensity fluctuations at intra event scale i e the temporal distribution of rainfall intensity peaks bursts in the rainfall profile which have important influences on hydrological processes frauenfeld and truman 2004 dunkerley 2012 orchard et al 2013 todisco 2014 wang et al 2017 some studies have found that the rainfall events characterized by similar general properties e g ra rd ia i5 i10 i30 ei30 etc could produce greatly different amounts of runoff and soil loss and they proposed that these phenomena were likely due to the influence of rainfall intensity fluctuation dunkerley 2012 todisco 2014 dunkerley 2015 mohamadi and kavian 2015 the features of rainfall intensity fluctuation included the timing of the most intense period of rainfall e g early peak centre peak and late peak patterns intra storm variations in intensity e g increasing decreasing and their mixed models intermittency no rain intervals between intensity peaks the values of intensity peaks and the number and distribution of rainfall peaks including secondary peaks parsons and stone 2006 dunkerley 2012 todisco 2014 dunkerley 2015 the rainfall intensity fluctuation features were generally considered to exert an important influence on hydrological and erosive processes which has become increasingly concerned in studies of runoff and soil loss parsons and stone 2006 dunkerley 2012 tao et al 2017 it was found that rainfall intensity fluctuation resulted in variability of infiltration rates and peak of runoff subsequently influenced the amount of runoff from bare land dunkerley 2012 frauenfeld and truman 2004 indicated that simulated rainfall events with varying intensity iv resulted in 28 more runoff and 32 more soil loss from bare land compared to the rainfall events with constant intensity ic before the occurrence of the maximum intensity peak parsons and stone 2006 conducted simulated rainstorms to explore the effects of rainfall intensity fluctuation on inter rill erosion in bare land under different soil types and they found that soil loss of ic events only accounted for 75 of that from iv events with iv events transporting sediment with higher clay contents and lower sand contents than that transported by ic events mohamadi and kavian 2015 measured the runoff and soil loss in field pasture land under natural rainfall events and concluded that rainfall events with increasing rainfall intensity yielded 1 5 to 4 9 times higher surface runoff and 1 7 to 3 9 times larger soil loss than those of other rainfall patterns wang et al 2016 suggested the rainfall pattern with rainfall amount concentrated in the later period generated 1 5 to 6 times larger soil loss from bare land compared to other patterns based on field monitoring additionally the occurring period of the maximum intensity in the rainfall profile also acted as an important factor in producing runoff and soil loss dunkerley 2012 and flanagan et al 1988 showed that the runoff and soil loss rates in bare land from late peaking storms under simulated rainfall experiments were 1 43 3 85 and 1 50 to 8 50 times larger than those from uniform or early peaking storms however römkens et al 2001 demonstrated that the rainfall events with early peaks produced 1 41 times more soil loss compared to those with late peaks in bare soil based on simulated rainfall experiments some indicators have been proposed to quantify rainfall intensity fluctuation and their relationships with runoff and soil loss were investigated dunkerley 2015 proposed the intra event rainfall intermittency ieri within rainfall events according to a rainfall intensity threshold and suggested that the rainfall events with large ieri might eliminate the surface ponding and recover the infiltrability capacity which facilitated the transformation of rainfall into infiltration consequently decreasing the overland flow todisco 2014 defined the rainfall bursts peaks using a threshold rainfall rate and employed the characteristics of rainfall peaks to recognize the erosive events in cultivated fallow based on pluviograph records field monitoring also found that every intensity burst during a natural rainfall event would lead to the corresponding peak of surface runoff and sediment from coal mining refuse site smith and olyphant 1994 dunkerley 2020 proposed an index to describe rainfall amount in wettest 5 rainfall duration edf5 and the edf5 might play a more important role in erosive processes compared to i30 it can be found that most of previous studies investigated the relationships between rainfall intensity fluctuation and runoff and soil erosion by the simulated rainfall experiments under bare land however rainfall simulations often set one or several fixed rainfall intensity for a specific event or establish different rainfall patterns by tuning several intensity peaks and this synthetic procedure might not fully reflect the complexity of natural rainfall intensity fluctuation although some indices have been established to characterize rainfall intensity fluctuation whereas these indices have not comprehensively quantified the detailed characteristics of rainfall intensity fluctuation and they usually failed to take account of the effects of bursts within rainfall events on hydrological processes solid indicators are needed to capture the intensity fluctuation characteristics of natural rainfall events and investigate their quantitative relationships with soil erosion response variables under restoration vegetation which is the motivation of the work presented in this paper in this study field observations of runoff and soil loss of restoration vegetation under natural rainfall conditions were conducted from 2011 to 2016 in the loess plateau of china the objectives of this study were 1 to propose a series of indicators to describe the complex features of rainfall intensity fluctuation 2 to quantify the relationships between rainfall intensity fluctuation indicators and runoff and soil loss and 3 to develop regression models with consideration of rainfall intensity fluctuation to predict runoff and soil loss 2 indicators of rainfall intensity fluctuation in contrast to the simulated rainfall events with uniform intensity pattern the intensity profiles of natural rainfall events consist of multiple intensity bursts in this study rainfall depth was measured by the tipping bucket rain gauge and the temporal resolution was the time interval under one tip fig 1 is the schematic diagram of rainfall intensity profile of one event and it represents the general form of erosive rainfall events for the study area the average intensity ia was used to disaggregate a rainfall event into high intensity zone and low intensity zone with intensities larger and lower than ia respectively fig 1 the intensity peak was defined as the intensity of burst which was larger than the former and later instantaneous intensity a series of indicators are proposed to describe the features of rainfall intensity fluctuation first we quantified the general rainfall characteristics of the high intensity zone such as the rainfall depth rah duration rdh and average intensity iah due to the critical role of intensity peaks the average intensity of varying peaks iap was also established in addition to above characteristics of the high intensity zone some indicators to describe relative fluctuation features of the whole rainfall event were also proposed for example the fraction of duration in low intensity zone fdl the fraction of rainfall amount in high intensity zone fah the relative amplitude of rainfall intensity ram and the relative number of rainfall peaks n table 1 lists all the rainfall indices and their definitions the rah and rdh are the rainfall amount and rainfall duration in the high intensity zone with the average intensity of iah which was calculated as 1 i ah r a h r d h the average intensity of rainfall peaks iap is the average value of all intensity peaks in high intensity zone 2 i ap i 1 n i peak i n where ipeak i is the intensity of the ith rainfall peak in high intensity zone mm min 1 i 1 2 3 n and n is the number of rainfall peaks the fraction of duration in low intensity zone fdl is calculated as the fraction of rainfall duration in low intensity zone to that of the whole rainfall event 3 f dl 1 r d h rd the fraction of rainfall amount in high intensity zone fah indicates the rainfall concentration degree and it was calculated as the fraction of rainfall amount in high intensity zone to that of the whole rainfall event 4 f ah r a h ra the relative amplitude of rainfall intensity ram was defined as the maximum variation in rainfall intensity relative to ia it indicates the magnitude of the relative amplitude between the maximum and minimum rainfall intensity which was calculated as 5 r am i max i min i a where imax and imin is the maximum and minimum intensity of the whole rainfall event respectively the relative number of rainfall peaks n indicates the peak numbers in unit rainfall duration and it was calculated as 6 n n rd 3 materials and methods 3 1 study area this study was conducted in the yangjuangou catchment 36 42 n 109 31 e which is located in the central region of the loess plateau shaanxi province china fig 2 the catchment has a total area of 2 02 km2 with an elevation ranging from 1050 to 1298 m it is a typical semi arid area with an average annual precipitation of 536 mm varying from 330 to 959 mm during 1951 to 2016 the average annual air temperature is 9 4 c with average values in july and january of 22 9 and 6 5 c respectively the rainfall is mainly concentrated between june and september more than 70 of total annual precipitation and has large inter annual variations with coefficient of variation cv of approximately 30 the soil is a calcaric cambisol with a maximum depth of approximately 200 m it had a uniform texture and was easily erodible the dominant vegetation in the catchment consists of replanted vegetation due to the grain for green project launched in 1998 plant species include robinia pseudoacacia prunus armeniaca artemisia sacrorum stipa bungeana and artemisia scoparia this catchment is a typical region suffering from severe soil erosion with the mean rate of 90 42 t ha 1 y 1 during 1980 1990 62 73 t ha 1 y 1 in 1992 1996 and 32 70 t ha 1 y 1 in 2014 most of soil erosion is produced by several rainstorms in the rainy season 3 2 field experiments six replicate runoff plots of 3 m 10 m were established in grass cover replanted with artemisia sacrorum and stipa bungeana to measure runoff and soil loss during 2011 2016 fig 2 the plots had similar slope gradient of approximately 22 24 and similar slope aspect of northeast the pvc material sheets at a depth of 30 cm were used as the boundaries of runoff plots to prevent surface water flowing from lateral seepage during rainfall a steel collection system consisting of gutter plastic pipe and water containers was installed at the bottom boundary of each plot to collect event runoff and sediment rainfall depth was measured by a tipping bucket rain gauge rg3 m onset computer corp bourne ma usa with the resolution of 0 2 mm the rainfall amount under one tip the rainfall events were separated by the interval more than 6 h between two consecutive rainy periods which was widely used in separating rainfall events huff 1967 if one rainfall event generated runoff this rainfall event was recognized as erosive rainfall event the instantaneous rainfall intensity was calculated through dividing 0 2 mm by the duration between successive tips and subsequently the rainfall intensity profile of an event was obtained the runoff mixed with the sediment discharged from each plot was collected after each rainfall event and the volume was measured after settling for 24 h sediment was separated from water sediment from the gutter was also collected the collected sediment was first air dried for more than 24 h and dried in an oven at a temperature of 105 c for longer than 8 h until constant weight was achieved there were total twenty nine erosive rainfall events during the study period with fourteen and fifteen events during 2011 2013 and 2014 2016 respectively 3 3 data analysis in order to evaluate the impact of rainfall intensity fluctuation on runoff and soil loss the runoff coefficient rc sediment concentration sc and soil loss coefficient slc were employed as erosive response variables in this study and the effect of rainfall amount variability among events can be eliminated the rc was calculated as the ratio of runoff depth to rainfall amount the sc referred to the average sediment concentration of an erosive rainfall event g cm 3 which was calculated by the ratio of soil loss amount and runoff volume the slc was defined as the sediment yield in unit area induced by unit rainfall amount g m 2 mm 1 which could substantially demonstrate the effects of rainfall intensity fluctuation excluding the effects of rainfall amount the rc and slc reflected the ability of rainfall to produce runoff and soil loss respectively the sc revealed the ability of runoff to generate soil loss there were some variations in dependent variables rc sc and slc among the six replicate runoff plots under same erosive rainfall event however the variations were mostly tiny and the differences of land surface factors among the plots were difficult to be fully eliminated the average values for the six plots could mostly represent the actual magnitude of runoff and soil loss hence the rc sc and slc used in the study were the average values of the six plots a logarithmic transformation was applied to all variables due to their abnormal distributions then a pearson correlation matrix was conducted to analyse the relationships between all rainfall parameters and rc sc and slc the pca principal component analysis method was used to transform rainfall parameters into principal components pcs which were employed further in stepwise regression analysis abdul wahab et al 2005 then each pc in the regression equations was replaced by corresponding variable with the highest interpretation abdul wahab et al 2005 and the relationships between the erosion response variables rc sc and slc and rainfall parameters were quantified the runoff sediment concentration and soil loss regression models that considered rainfall intensity fluctuation were called rmf scmf and slmf respectively only the fitting results cannot fully reflect the performance of a regression model and the developed models need to be validated thus the observed data has been divided into two parts for fitting and validating the regression models the observed data from 2011 to 2013 was used to establish regression models and then the observed rainfall data from 2014 to 2016 was used to predict erosion variables the prediction ability is an important aspect for evaluating the applicability of a model both the fitting and predicting results of the developed models were evaluated in this study in addition we also established the relationships between erosive response variables rc sc and slc and general rainfall parameters ra rd ia i30 using stepwise regression analysis mentioned above the original runoff sediment concentration and soil loss regression models that did not consider rainfall intensity fluctuation indicators were called rmo scmo and slmo respectively the determination coefficient r 2 root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were applied to evaluate the validity and prediction accuracy of the models kinnell 2017 additionally a new model comparison index mci developed by kinnell 2016 was employed to directly compare the validity of different models the r 2 rmse nse and mci were calculated using the following equations 7 r 2 j 1 m p j o 2 j 1 m o j o 2 8 rmse 1 m j 1 m o j p j 2 9 nse 1 j 1 m o j p j 2 j 1 m o j o 2 10 mci 1 j 1 m o j p f j 2 j 1 m o j p o j 2 where m is the number of erosive rainfall events j 1 2 3 m oj and pj are the observed and predicted rc sc or slc of the jth rainfall event respectively o is the average observed value of rc sc or slc and pfj and poj are the predicted values by rmf or scmf slmf and rmo or scmo slmo respectively the higher r 2 lower rmse and higher nse values the better the goodness of simulation a value of 1 for nse indicates a perfect match of observed and predicted data negative values of mci indicated rmf scmf and slmf were less effective than rmo scmo and slmo and vice versa if the two types of models had the same efficiency in prediction the mci was equal to zero and it ranged to 1 if the rmf scmf and slmf were perfect 4 results 4 1 rainfall characteristics the twelve rainfall parameters of the twenty nine erosive rainfall events from 2011 to 2016 are shown in table 2 and fig 3 the ra of each rainfall event ranged from 4 00 to 91 60 mm with an average value of 31 74 mm and the rd was in the range of 24 63 to 3122 45 min with an average value of 1096 21 min the ia and i30 varied from 0 01 to 0 23 mm min 1 0 45 to 13 64 mm h 1 and from 0 03 to 0 70 mm min 1 1 98 to 42 00 mm h 1 with average values of 0 04 and 0 23 mm min 1 2 55 to 13 83 mm h 1 respectively the ra rd ia and i30 values varied by several orders of magnitude indicating that the erosive rainfall events represented a wide range of rainfall conditions as shown in table 2 the rah ranged from 3 40 to 71 20 mm with an average value of 24 52 mm which accounted for approximately 59 94 of the ra based on the fah index the rdh ranged from 8 05 to 973 58 min with the mean value of 297 61 min and it only accounted for 10 44 of the rd the rainfall duration in low intensity zone accounted for 56 90 of the total rainfall duration according to the fdl index indicating that the duration of low intensity zone was much longer than rdh consequently approximately 78 of rainfall amount dropped in less than 27 of the total duration of rainfall event the iah and iap were approximately four and eight times larger than the ia with mean values of 0 13 and 0 32 mm min 1 7 96 to 19 16 mm h 1 respectively the order of the four intensity indices is iap i30 iah and ia the ram 2 82 to 84 44 and n 0 01 to 0 28 both showed large ranges indicating the strong variability of rainfall intensity fluctuation among rainfall events 4 2 event runoff sediment concentration and soil loss the rc sc and slc among rainfall events were highly variable with the cv of 3 20 1 64 and 1 86 respectively as evident from fig 4 the rc ranged from 0 003 to 2 771 with the mean of 0 44 and the sc varied from 0 11 to 40 28 kg m 3 with the mean of 5 61 kg m 3 the slc was within the ranges of 0 001 to 1 10 g m 2 mm 1 with the mean of 0 08 g m 2 mm 1 the sc and slc of several erosive rainfall events 13th 15th 16th 17th and 29th were so small that can be ignored the 5th 19th and 28th events produced the largest rc 2 741 2 744 and 2 771 respectively and the 5th and 28th events showed the largest sc 40 28 and 23 73 kg m 3 respectively and slc 1 10 and 0 66 g m 2 mm 1 respectively according to fig 3 the 5th 1 39 mm min 1 83 47 mm h 1 and 28th 0 91 mm min 1 54 86 mm h 1 events had the larger iap than other events and the fdl 0 90 and fah 0 94 of the 5th event were highest among the 29 erosive rainfall events furthermore there was strong correlations between event soil loss and runoff amount as shown in fig 5 the slc first sharply increased and then approached an asymptotic value with the increase of rc which could be described as a power function r 2 0 80 p 0 01 4 3 main rainfall characteristics influencing runoff sediment concentration and soil loss table 3 shows the pearson correlation analysis between erosion variables and rainfall parameters there were three rainfall parameters ra rd and rah showing non significant correlations with rc sc and slc p 0 05 the i30 iah iap and ram were significantly correlated with rc sc and slc p 0 05 the ia rdh and n were significantly correlated with rc p 0 05 but not with sc and slc p 0 05 the fdl was significantly correlated with rc and slc p 0 05 but not with sc p 0 05 whereas the fah was only significantly correlated with sc p 0 05 most of the rainfall parameters had positive correlations with rc and slc except the two duration characteristics rd and rdh as shown in table 3 among the twelve rainfall parameters the iap had the strongest significant correlation with rc r 0 77 sc r 0 59 and slc r 0 80 followed by i30 r 0 70 0 45 and 0 66 respectively and then iah r 0 67 0 51 and 0 65 respectively generally the correlations between rainfall parameters and sc were weaker compared to rc and slc table 4 shows the pcs with rotated factor loadings for rc based on the eight significantly related rainfall parameters ia i30 rdh iah iap fdl ram n the first two pcs accounted for more than 85 of the total variation with eigenvalues greater than 1 the iap iah and i30 had high loadings in pc1 0 8 accounting for 55 of the total variation the pc2 accounted for nearly 30 of the total variation with n and ia having high loadings in pc3 pc4 and pc5 the variables with the highest loadings were rdh ram and fdl respectively and they explained about 14 of the total variation table 5 shows the pcs with rotated factor loadings for sc based on the five significantly related rainfall parameters i30 iah iap fdl ram the first two pcs accounted for more than 90 of the total variation with eigenvalues greater than 1 the i30 iah and iap showed high loadings in pc1 0 8 accounting for 71 of the total variation the pc2 accounted for nearly 20 of the total variation with ram having highest loadings the pc3 accounted for nearly 7 4 of the total variation with fah having highest loadings the rest of pcs did not have any variables with high loadings and accounted for little of the total variation 1 table 6 shows the pcs with rotated factor loadings for slc based on the five significantly related rainfall parameters ia i30 iap fdl ram only the first pc had eigenvalue greater than 1 and accounted for more than 70 of the total variation with iah i30 and iap having high loadings the pc2 and pc3 accounted for about 20 and 8 of the total variation with ram and fdl having the highest loadings respectively the rest of pcs did not have any variables with high loadings and accounted for little of the total variation approximately 1 4 4 simulation of runoff and soil loss 4 4 1 regression models of runoff and soil loss based on the above regression analyses with pcs the inverse transformation was essential to obtain the relationships between log rc log sc and log slc with the rainfall parameters the iap and rdh were selected to describe rc and the iah and ram were employed to control sc and slc based on the pca the multiple regression models for predicting runoff sediment concentration and soil loss with consideration of rainfall intensity fluctuation rmf scmf

fig 7 and fig 8 show the comparisons between observed and fitted values of rc sc and slc by above regression models during 2011 2013 respectively the data points simulated by the rmf scmf and slmf fig 6a fig 7a and fig 8a were closer to the 1 1 line compared to those by rmo scmo and slmo fig 6b fig 7b and fig 8b the model performance evaluation criteria r 2 rmse nse and mci are shown in table 7 the rmf scmf and slmf had higher r 2 values 0 74 0 62 and 0 87 lower rmse values 0 25 0 31 and 0 32 and higher nse values 0 74 0 61 and 0 85 for rc sc and slc simulations compared to rmo scmo and slmo r 2

more accurate simulated values and they were appreciably better than the rmo scmo and slmo we have also developed the runoff and soil loss regression models using the data of the whole 6 years it was found that the rmf scmf and slmf also gained better simulation results than the rmo scmo and slmo table s1 figs s1 s3 4 4 2 prediction of runoff and soil loss fig 9 fig 10 and fig 11 show the comparisons between the observed and predicted values of rc sc and slc during 2014 2016 by above established regression models respectively the performances of the rmf scmf and slmf in predicting rc sc and slc were more satisfactory than those of the rmo scmo and slmo the distributions of data points in fig 9a fig 10a and fig 11a predicted by rmf scmf and slmf were closer to the 1 1 line with lower scatter than those in fig 9b fig 10b and fig 11b predicted by rmo scmo and slmo respectively this was also supported by the higher r 2 values 0 73 0 40 and 0 78 lower rmse values 0 56 0 58 and 0 84 higher nse values 0 59 0 37 and 0 65 and positive mci values 0 26 0 07 and 0 34 of the rmf scmf and slmf for predicting rc sc and slc compared to those of the rmo scmo and slmo table 7 additionally the prediction accuracy of slc was higher than that of rc and that of sc was lowest as indicated by the model performance evaluation criteria in table 7 it can be found from figs 9 11 that the rmf scmf and slmf somewhat overestimated the low rc sc and slc events the rmo scmo and slmo much overestimated the low rc sc and slc events and they also underestimated the high rc sc and slc events the prediction error of the rmf scmf and slmf were much lower than those of the rmo scmo and slmo 5 discussion 5 1 effects of rainfall intensity fluctuation on runoff and soil loss previous studies have already adopted some indicators to represent rainfall intensity fluctuation such as the intra event rainfall intermittency within rainfall profile proposed by dunkerley 2015 however the detailed characteristics during rain period which played a crucial role in the surface runoff and soil erosion were not considered in dunkerley 2015 as the indicators in previous studies mostly described the limited feature of intensity fluctuation within rainfall events this study proposed abundant rainfall indicators to substantially reveal the properties of rainfall intensity fluctuation for this purpose the rainfall event was disaggregated into high intensity zone and low intensity zone based on ia and the general and relative characteristics of high intensity zone has been described in detail using the indicators rah rdh iah and fdl fah furthermore the iap and n were proposed to further describe the magnitude and frequency of intensity peaks within the rainfall profile respectively in addition we also used the ram to describe the relative amplitude of rainfall intensity during a rainfall event in summary the proposed rainfall indicators in this study comprehensively quantified the general and relative features of rainfall intensity fluctuation within a natural rainfall event which further advanced the researches concerning rainfall intensity fluctuation in this study most of the proposed rainfall intensity fluctuation indicators e g iah iap fdl rdh and ram were significantly correlated with the rc sc and slc whereas in the general rainfall parameters only the i30 exhibited significant correlations with erosive variables table 3 the proposed rainfall indicators not only captured the features of intensity fluctuation of natural rainfall events and they were also significantly related to the rc sc and slc hence the indicators of rainfall intensity fluctuation should be combined with the general rainfall parameters to explore the effects of rainfall on runoff and soil loss parsons and stone 2006 dunkerley 2012 dunkerley 2018 dunkerley 2019 the rainfall peaks within a rainfall event would accelerate the processes of air entrapment ephemeral ponding splash detachment and soil aggregate breakdown gao et al 2003 ewane and lee 2016 dunkerley 2019 which consequently restricted infiltration rates and induced corresponding peaks of runoff and soil loss rates ultimately leading to greater runoff depth and soil loss flanagan 1988 smith and olyphant 1994 dunkerley 2012 dunkerley 2019 the iap proposed in this study described the magnitude of average rainfall peaks and it had the highest positive correlations with rc sc and slc among the rainfall indicators table 3 furthermore the 5th and 28th events which had the highest iap produced the highest rc sc and slc among the events figs 3 and 4 the iah described the magnitude of average rainfall intensity in high intensity zone and it played the similar role as iap the ram described the relative magnitude of maximum rainfall peak in the intensity profile and it can be found that the 5th and 28th events had high ram fig 3 the high rdh indicated that average rainfall intensity in high intensity zone was relatively low under certain rainfall amount and thus it was negatively correlated with runoff and soil loss which was further supported by the fact that the 5th and 28th events had relatively low rdh fig 3 the high iap iah ram and low rdh are the main features of rainstorms which are critical for producing runoff and soil loss in the study area and these four factors were selected to simulate runoff and soil loss in this study it should be noted that the effects of rainfall intensity fluctuation on runoff and soil loss may depend on the size of the plot the steepness of plot and the type of soil and vegetation cover dunkerley 2020 the rainfall intensity fluctuation may become less important as scale increases and the gently sloping sites with high infiltration capacity might show less effect of intensity fluctuations in addition the main indicators of rainfall intensity fluctuation controlling runoff and soil loss may be changeable among different land use cover therefore additional field work is needed to collect more data and determine the main rainfall parameters and compare the varying relationships between rainfall intensity fluctuation and runoff and soil loss under different land surface conditions 5 2 runoff and soil loss models considering rainfall intensity fluctuation the runoff and soil loss models using general rainfall parameters mostly overlooked the considerable effects of rainfall intensity fluctuation on generating runoff and soil loss ultimately decreasing the prediction capacity of runoff and soil loss parsons and stone 2006 dunkerley 2012 dunkerley 2019 in contrast the models considering the rainfall intensity fluctuation rmf scmf and slmf showed better performances in predicting rc sc and slc compared to the models using general rainfall parameters rmo scmo and slmo in this study table 7 however there were some estimation errors between observed and predicted runoff and soil loss by rmf scmf and slmf i e overestimation of the low rc sc and slc events this might be due to that the rmf scmf and slmf were statistical models which only considered the rainfall characteristics and they neglected the impacts of land surface factors e g vegetation cover antecedent soil wetness and topography on the processes of runoff generation and soil erosion furthermore some features of rainfall intensity fluctuation should be incorporated in the model for example the location of intensity peaks early peak late peak etc number of most intense peaks and intensity peak prominence within rainfall events if an intensity peak arrives toward the end of an event when the soil has already become wet it may drive more runoff deeper and faster so more erosive than if the same peak had arrived near the beginning of the event the most intense peaks might offer useful predictive power rather than all peaks since some only exceed the mean rainfall intensity by a tiny amount peak prominence is probably effective in capturing the ongoing intensity dynamics not in respect to an average rainfall but to the peak boundary conditions the matlab findpeaks function can return prominence values so as to identify very severe peaks from more normal ones it should be noted that the regression runoff and soil loss models considering the rainfall intensity fluctuation may depend on the intensity threshold to disaggregate the rainfall event besides the ia the medium rainfall intensity im is also a choice to quantify the high intensity zone and low intensity zone furthermore from the perspective of soil capacity to accept rainfall and produce runoff the average infiltration rate of soil if can be also considered as a threshold to disaggregate the rainfall event i e the rainfall intensity over if as high intensity and below if as the low intensity to determine the reasonable threshold the performances of regression runoff and soil loss models using different thresholds ia im and if were compared see appendix a the results showed that the models employing the ia as threshold exhibited better simulation performances compared to other thresholds as a consequence the average rainfall intensity should be chosen as suitable threshold for disaggregating the rainfall events in this study the rainfall profile can be also divided into low 0 25th quantile medium 25th 75th quantile and high 75th 100th quantile intensity zones or a third for each dunkerley 2019 todisco et al 2019 in this case numerous indicators are needed to characterize the rainfall intensity fluctuation furthermore a period of no rain for 6 h was considered to separate rainfall events in this study the rainfall events can be divided into erosive storms and non erosive storms from pluviograph as proposed by todisco 2014 thus how to divide the rainfall profile and how to divide the rainfall events can also influence the effects of rainfall intensity fluctuation on runoff and soil loss which is the next step in our investigation rainfall is the main driving force of runoff and soil erosion and runoff has direct effect on event soil loss the soil loss prediction models incorporating the runoff as primary indicator could improve the model performance kinnell 2016 2017 this study also indicated that the event soil loss coefficient had a good power function with runoff coefficient however it is difficult to widely collect runoff data in field experiments due to economic and human input especially under the complex terrain in contrast to the much more input to obtain runoff data the collection of instantaneous rainfall intensity data is much easy using recording rain gauges furthermore the accuracy of regression model in predicting soil loss coefficient was higher than that of runoff coefficient and that of sediment concentration was lowest in this study thus the approach to simulate soil loss by predicting the runoff then sediment concentration may have great uncertainties hence employing the rainfall intensity fluctuation to predict the soil loss seems to be a more practical approach to improve the prediction accuracy of runoff and soil loss further studies are needed to incorporate rainfall intensity fluctuation characteristics into physical runoff and soil erosion models with considering the roles of both rainfall characteristics and land surface factors in generation of runoff and soil erosion tao et al 2017 used a modified kinematic wave equation to accurately simulate runoff and sediment rates with rainfall fluctuation patterns todisco 2014 proposed that using new rainfall erosivity factors in usle rusle models which considered rainfall intensity fluctuation might be an effective way to improve predictions of soil erosion with respect to the usle rusle models the rainfall erosivity factor ei30 only partially involved rainfall fluctuation when calculating the rainfall kinetic energy e while i30 had little information of rainfall intensity fluctuation wang et al 2014 wang et al 2016 in this study we found that iap incorporated more intensity fluctuation information and it was closely related to runoff and soil loss therefore the iap as well as other dimensionless indicators of rainfall fluctuation features could be employed to develop a new rainfall erosivity factor and established the modified usle rusle models in addition the runoff was considered as the primary impacting factor of the soil loss both the rainfall intensity fluctuation and runoff factors could be employed in the usle rusle models to predict soil loss on hillslopes the developed modified models should be tested under different land use types and geomorphic features 6 conclusions in this study a series of rainfall indicators describing the characteristics of rainfall intensity fluctuation were proposed and the regression models between runoff and soil loss with the proposed rainfall indicators were established the natural rainfall events displayed strong intensity fluctuations e g aggregation intermittency and variability most of the rainfall intensity fluctuation indicators were significantly correlated with runoff sediment concentration and soil loss the iap and rdh primarily controlled runoff and iah and ram controlled sediment concentration and soil erosion the performances of regression models considering rainfall intensity fluctuation was more satisfactory in predicting runoff and soil loss compared to those which only considered general rainfall indicators additionally the established models were better in predicting soil erosion compared to runoff and sediment concentration in summary the first novelty of this study is that the proposed rainfall indicators could describe the complex features of intensity fluctuation of natural rainfall and they better accounted for bursts of rainfall on runoff and soil loss than the general rainfall parameters second the regression models considering rainfall intensity fluctuation had good performances in predicting runoff and soil loss and they can be of practical use as they only need the instantaneous rainfall intensity data which can be easily observed however the obtained results in this study were verified only under grassland in the loess plateau the proposed rainfall indicators and developed models should be further evaluated under different climatic land use cover soil properties and topography conditions in other regions worldwide credit authorship contribution statement jianbo liu formal analysis methodology writing original draft yue liang formal analysis methodology writing

rc sc and slc during 2011 2013 respectively figs s7 s9 show the comparisons between the observed and predicted values of rc sc and slc during 2014 2016 respectively the model performance evaluation criteria r 2 rmse nse and mci to fit and predict rc sc and slc are shown in table s2 the regression models considering rainfall intensity fluctuation with the ia as disaggregating threshold had the higher r 2 values lower rmse values higher nse values and higher mci values in both fitting and prediction than the regression models with if and im as disaggregating thresholds table s2 furthermore the regression models with if and im as disaggregating thresholds even had negative mci values in prediction table s2 which indicated the prediction performances of these models were worse than the original regression models as shown in figs s4 s9 the data points simulated by the regression models with if and im as disaggregating thresholds had larger scatter around the 1 1 line compared to the model with ia as disaggregating threshold especially the regression models with if and im as disaggregating thresholds greatly overestimated the low rc and slc events and underestimated the high rc and slc events during prediction in 2014 2016 figs s7 and s9 these results demonstrated that the regression models with ia as disaggregating threshold exhibited more accurate simulations and they were appreciably better than the regression models using if and im as disaggregating thresholds as a consequence the average rainfall intensity should be chosen as suitable threshold for disaggregating the rainfall events to simulate runoff and soil loss appendix b supplementary data supplementary data to this article can be found online at https doi org 10 1016 j jhydrol 2022 127494 appendix b
