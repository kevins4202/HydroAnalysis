10985,to understand the impacts of fertilizer treatment and ryegrass growth on the dynamic changes of soil water is essential to use available soil water and rainfall sagaciously and develop a sustainable artificial ryegrass land in sichuan basin area and the similar areas in the world in the current research the dynamic changes of soil water were measured under different nitrogen fertilizer treatments by field experiment and epic model environment policy integrated climate simulation in the hilly region of sichuan basin area from 2011 to 2015 results revealed that the epic model simulated the dynamic changes of soil water well as the simulated and observed values of forage yield leaf area index and ryegrass height exhibited a good correlation when the nitrogen fertilizer was 150 kg hm2 the soil water consumed by ryegrass during january to may period recovered well during june to september it is more sustainable treatment than other experimental treatments considering in a long period furthermore our simulation demonstrated that the roots especially distributed in 0 50 cm soil has a significant effect on available soil water in 0 1 m soil root distributed in 0 20 cm and 60 100 cm soil affected the available soil water in 0 50 cm and 60 100 cm soil respectively keywords ryegrass epic model forage yield soil water nitrogen fertilizer 1 introduction ryegrass widely cultivated in the world because of its high nutritional value crude protein content of more than 25 song et al 2014 great digestibility liu et al 2009 ruckle et al 2017 good palatability strong cold resistance and other better characteristics förster et al 2018 zhai et al 2013 it is one of the most important cold season forages in the hilly region of sichuan basin area the hilly region of sichuan basin is considered as one of the suitable places to plant forage crops such as ryegrass due to its weather appropriateness with an annual rainfall of 800 1000 mm an annual average temperature of 16 18 c and a frost free period of 230 340 d liang et al 2016 besides the weather reasons building artificial ryegrass land can also reduce soil erosion in the hilly region of sichuan basin where the annual soil erosion module is more than 9800 t km2 a seasonal drought brings serious water stress for ryegrass growth from november to april in sichuan basin region weather record from 1981 to 2016 showed that more than 70 of rainfall took place from june to september pang et al 2010 in the hilly region of sichuan basin while the total precipitation from november to april is not more than 300 mm which is not enough for ryegrass growth without irrigation water deep soil water becomes the vital water source for ryegrass to survive and produce a high forage yield therefore effective and sustainable use of deep soil water becomes one of the hot points for artificial grassland in hilly regions of sichuan basin during 1980 2010 large artificial alfalfa land had built in the hilly region of the loess plateau to feed more livestock animals however due to the excessive depletion of soil water a dry soil layer built in deep soil wang et al 2012 which at last caused the instability of forage yield and hindered the development of livestock animals in that region fang et al 2010 luo et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to clarify the dynamic changes of soil water in deep soil in artificial ryegrass land at least to understand clearly the impacts of ryegrass on soil water changes in a long period in hilly regions of sichuan basin shortage of nitrogen caused by serious soil erosion is another obstacle for artificial ryegrass land in the hilly region of sichuan basin area sharma and chaubey 2017 reported that more than 40 of nitrogen lost from soil by surface runoff directly related to the annual precipitation and fertilization rate similar situation persists in hilly regions of sichuan basin which causes a serious shortage of nitrogen in this area as compared with other forage grass ryegrass needs more nitrogen to grow and build green leaves and tillers chen et al 2013 nitrogen fertilizer is one of the better management to replenish nitrogen need in artificial ryegrass land however too much application of chemical nitrogen fertilizer caused a large output of nitrogen from agricultural land louarn et al 2015 jankowski et al 2018 and also might cause an excessive depletion of soil water in deep soil jankowski et al 2018 hence it s important to elucidate the reasonable use of nitrogen fertilizers in sichuan basin area to avoid the shortage of nitrogen and minimize excessive depletion of water in deep soil crop model simulation as well as long term experiment are two effective methods to investigate the dynamic changes of soil water in deep soil in a long term period as a multi crop model williams et al 1984 the epic model includes more than ten sub modules such as meteorology soil and crop through co operation among various sub modules the epic model can calculate water stress days and nitrogen stress days suffered by ryegrass and can perform long term quantitative simulation for crop growth water cycle and nitrogen cycle well in a complex cropping system he and cai 2016 williams 1990 several researchers have confirmed the accuracy of crop yield and soil moisture simulated by epic model in winter wheat field spring corn field and alfalfa land all model users are agreed that it is necessary to localize and calibrate the epic model before using it for simulation camargo and kemanian 2016 xiong et al 2014 xu et al 2016 at present the epic model was not used in artificial ryegrass land in sichuan basin area objectives of this paper are 1 to investigate the impacts of ryegrass growth on the dynamic changes of soil water in deep soil in the hilly region of sichuan basin area 2 to explore the impacts of nitrogen fertilizer on ryegrass growth and on soil water depletion based on the long term experiment and epic simulation 3 to provide some suggestion for the farmers to use fertilizers and soil water sustainably in artificial land in the hilly region of sichuan basin area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area mianyang n 30 71 33 01 e 103 75 105 72 situated at the middle and upper reaches of fujiang river is a typical hilly region in the northwestern part of sichuan basin more than 78 of the 2 106 hm2 area covered by hills and mountains with an average elevation of 462 m mianyang located in a subtropical monsoon climate zone its annual precipitation is 826 1417 mm with the annual temperature of 14 7 17 3 the sunshine of 1300 1328 h and the frost free period of 253 301 d the field experiment carried out from 2011 to 2015 at a typical hilly region of sichuan basin area in qingyi town the field experiment site located at one slope farm with a slope rate of 10 the soil of the experimental field was loam clay soil according to the fao soil classiﬁcation standards its thickness ranged from 0 8 m to 1 3 m with the mean value of 1 1 m its bulk density was 1 1 g cm3 with the perennial moisture content of 9 2 10 1 wilting point of 6 2 8 5 and organic matter content of 23 g kg total nitrogen total phosphorus and total potassium was 1 1 0 22 and 15 6 g kg respectively 2 2 field experiment 2 2 1 experimental design four fertility treatments were designed for this experiment as followed ck no nitrogen fertilizer n1 75 kg hm2 of nitrogen fertilizer n2 150 kg hm2 of nitrogen fertilizer and n3 225 kg hm2 of nitrogen fertilizer 50 of total nitrogen was applied as basal fertilizer and 50 as top dressed fertilizer 25 in january and 25 in march after harvest 4 treatments with 3 replicates were distributed in 12 plots by randomized block design each plot was 24 m2 with 4 m width and 6 m length a 1 m wide interval between plots designed for sample taking and field management convenience ryegrass planted in mid september with a seeding rate of 15 kg hm2 and a row spacing of 0 15 m and harvested 3 times in january march and may respectively nitrogen fertilizer top dressed into the field according to designed dosage after forage harvest phosphorous fertilizer for all plots was same with 90 kg hm2 p2o5 pesticide and herbicide was used when necessary to eliminate the impacts of plant diseases insect pests and weeds on ryegrass growth 2 2 2 sample collection before planting ryegrass soil samples were collected in 10 cm layers from the soil surface to the depth of 1 m soil at 5 points with 10 samples in each point and soil water content was determined for each layer after ryegrass sowing leaf area index and plant height were measured 2 times in each month while soil water content was measured 1 time each month leaf area index measured by canopy analyzer top1300 shanghai xinrui instruments co ltd plant height measured by a standard ruler from the ground to the top of the ryegrass in the state of natural growth and soil water content measured at 2 fixed points of each plot by tdr probes time domain reflectometry shanghai xinrui instruments co ltd which were buried in soil before experiment started 2 m2 of ryegrass harvested by hand in a suitable time to measure the forage yield in january march and may 2 3 epic simulation first epic model was evaluated using experimental data from 2011 to 2015 at mianyang city of sichuan basin area next the evaluated epic model used to simulate the growth of artificial grass and the dynamic changes of soil water under different nitrogen fertilizer treatments from 1981 to 2010 and output the simulation results for forage yield soil water dynamic changes stress days of nitrogen stress days of water and root growth on the basis of simulation results and field experiment results impacts of fertilizer and ryegrass growth on the dynamic changes of soil water were analyzed in a long period 30 years 2 4 statistical analysis in this study six statistical methods were used to evaluate the performance of epic model as following root mean square error rmse relative root mean square error rrmse relative error re model efficiency me correlation coefficient r coefficient of determination r2 me values are equal to the values of r2 if the values fall around a 1 1 line of simulated versus measured data however me is lower than r2 when the predictions are biased and can be negative ko et al 2009 the soil moisture content effective soil water content plant height and leaf area index of each treatment were averaged over three replicates for statistical analysis available soil water content

williams 1995 3 results and analysis 3 1 evaluation of the epic model comparison results showed that epic model simulated available soil water well in 0 1 m soil of artificial ryegrass land with the rmse of 11 28 mm and r2 of 0 75 0 92 fig 1 a the difference between the simulated and observed values of available soil water was not significant p 0 05 these results indicated the dynamic changes of available soil water simulated by the epic model are acceptable in the statistical range the simulated ryegrass height was not strictly equal to observed value while the r values were greater than 0 90 and the me values were greater than 0 95 fig 1b these results demonstrated that the height of ryegrass simulated by the epic model was accurate simulated leaf area index was similar with observed values with the r2 of 0 76 0 82 and the rmse of 0 09 0 20 furthermore the differences between r2 and me were less than 0 05 fig 2 a these results suggested that the dynamic change of the leaf area index of ryegrass simulated by the epic model was reasonable simulated ryegrass forage yield was 36 5 71 0 t hm2 which was similar to observed forage yield from 2011 to 2015 the epic model simulated forage yield of ryegrass well with the r2 of 0 90 0 96 the rmse of 0 42 0 55 t hm2 and the me of 0 88 0 96 fig 2b 3 2 dynamic changes of soil water in artificial ryegrass land available soil water in 0 1 0 m soil layer fluctuated with the precipitation in artificial ryegrass land during the experimental period fig 3 from june to september monthly precipitation was 120 mm which was significantly higher than other months therefore available soil water in artificial ryegrass land tended to increase from june to september from october to may mean monthly precipitation was 14 2 mm which was significantly lower than other months so available soil water in artificial ryegrass land decreased from october to may during the first 10 years 1981 1990 as compared with ck the monthly available water in 0 1 m soil of n1 n2 and n3 reduced 13 19 and 27 mm respectively meanwhile during the third 10 years 2001 2010 it reduced 14 21 and 53 mm respectively as time went by the available soil water of n1 n2 and n3 decreased more in 0 1 m soil during the third 10 years 2001 2010 than the first 10 years 1981 1990 during the first 10 years 1981 1990 monthly available soil water of n1 n2 and n3 in 0 10 m soil was 164 158 and 150 mm but it was 161 149 and 125 mm respectively in the third 10 years 2001 2010 overall these results displayed that the available soil water in ryegrass land depleted more with an increase of nitrogen fertilizer considering in a long period in the first 10 years 1981 1990 soil water content of n3 in 0 40 cm soil layer fluctuated and decreased due to the rate of precipitation and ryegrass consuming from october to april soil water of n3 in 60 100 cm soil recovered from may to september as the precipitation increased during this period fig 4 a similar results were perceived during third 10 years 2001 2010 in 0 40 cm soil for n3 treatment from october to april however in 80 100 cm soil the soil water not recovered well with the available soil water content of 7 10 fig 4b these results disclosed that soil water in deep soil was over depleted in n3 treatment even built some dry soil layer in 80 100 cm soil 3 3 nitrogen stress days and water stress days suffered by ryegrass nitrogen stress days suffered by ryegrass reduced gradually in n2 and n3 treatment in the first 10 years 1981 1990 nitrogen stress days of n2 and n3 decreased 2 d and 5 d respectively as compared with ck whereas it decreased 13 d and 21 d respectively in the third 10 years 2001 2010 fig 5 these results confirmed that nitrogen fertilizer relieved the negative impacts of nitrogen stress on ryegrass growth in the hilly region of sichuan basin area water stress days of n3 increased from 33 3 d in the first 10 years to 45 3 d in the third 10 years however water stress days of ck and n1 during the third 10 years was not significantly more than the first 10 years fig 5 these results indicated that fertilizer increased depletion of soil water in ryegrass land which increased the water stress days suffered by ryegrass 3 4 root growth in different soil layer during different years in the first and the second 10 years 1981 1990 and 1991 2000 an increasing and decreasing trend in the root biomass was observed this is mainly because of the amount of precipitation in corresponding years during this time the maximum root biomass was detected under n3 treatment fig 6 meanwhile in the third 10 years the root biomass of ck and n3 was lower than n1 and n2 due to nitrogen and water stress suffered by the ck and n3 respectively fig 5 these results indicated that a higher nitrogen treatment n3 depleted more available water in soil which eventually reduced the growth of roots in the third 10 years 2001 2010 in the third 10 years 2001 2010 the total root biomass of ck and n3 in 0 1 0 m soil was significantly lower than that in the first 10 year 1981 1990 due to the nitrogen and water stress suffered by ryegrass fig 5 in the first 10 years available soil water in top soil was relatively plentiful for ryegrass during this period most of root distributed in top soil while during the third 10 years available soil water in top soil consumed by ryegrass and more root developed into the deep soil therefore our results showed that during the third 10 years 2001 2010 the root biomass of n3 and n2 decrease as compared with the first 10 years 1981 1990 in 0 10 cm soil whereas the root biomass of n3 and n2 increased in 60 100 cm soil fig 7 during the third 10 years 2001 2010 compared with that during the first 10 years 1981 1990 also these dynamic changing of root distribution explained why available soil water of n2 and n3 reduced in deep soil during the third 10 years 3 5 forage yield of ryegrass land compared with ck the forage yield of n1 n2 and n3 increased 42 4 75 1 and 92 1 respectively in the first 10 years 1981 1990 similar results were detected in field experiment during 2011 2015 table 1 these findings suggested that equitable use of nitrogen fertilizer could increase forage yield of ryegrass in sichuan basin area however with the time going on the forage yield of ck and n3 both decreased in the third 10 years 2001 2010 as compared to the first 10 years 1981 1990 fig 8 due to the nitrogen stress and water stress suffered by ryegrass fig 5 these results indicated that n3 and ck might not sustainable fertilizer management in sichuan basin area 3 6 correlation analysis the available soil water in 0 1 m soil has a significant correlation with forage yield root shoot ration and root biomass particularly in n2 and n3 treatments the correlation index increased with the increasing of nitrogen fertilizer these findings suggested that forage yield root shoot ration and root biomass had an impact on available soil water in 0 1 m soil and this impact increases with the increase of fertilizers treatment root biomass in 0 10 cm soil and root biomass in 10 20 cm soil exhibited a significant correlation with available soil water in 0 1 m soil not only under n2 and n3 but also under ck and n1 treatments these results demonstrated that the root distribution especially in 0 50 cm soil has a significant effect on available soil water moreover further analysis on available soil water in 0 50 cm and 60 100 cm soil revealed that root in 0 20 cm soil affected the available soil water in 0 50 cm soil while root in 60 100 cm soil affected available soil water in deep soil 4 discussions 4 1 simulation results of the epic model in ryegrass land as an effective tool to calculate the impacts of the environment on agricultural production over a long period the epic model has been evaluated and applied worldwide camargo and kemanian 2016 han et al 2015 steduto et al 1995 wang et al 2015 2011 xiong et al 2014 previous research has confirmed that epic model can simulate the average yield well over a long period he and cai 2016 wang et al 2017 2011 williams 1990 xu et al 2016 yang et al 2019 results of this research unveiled that r values between simulated and observed ryegrass leaf area were greater than 0 90 and me values were all greater than 0 80 similarly the r values between simulated and observed ryegrass forage yield were greater than 0 90 and its me was greater than 0 95 williams 1995 improved the calculation module of groundwater in epic model cavero et al 1998 and lui et al 2000 introduced the baier robertson equation and the green and ampt equation respectively into the epic model these improvements significantly enhanced the simulation accuracy of the epic model for the water cycle in crop production systems results of this study showed that the r value of soil effective water content of 0 1 m soil layer simulated by the epic model was 0 86 0 95 and the rrmse value was 6 0 17 2 the monthly variation of soil water simulated by epic model was similar to the observations these results are consistent with previous studies hao et al 2015 li et al 2010 on the loess plateau overall the results of this paper confirmed the epic model not only can simulate the growth and forage yield of ryegrass well but also can simulate the dynamic changing of soil water in artificial ryegrass land 4 2 dynamic changing of soil water in artificial ryegrass land in the first 10 years the available soil water was sufficient and a higher forage yield was observed under higher nitrogen fertilizer treatment meanwhile during the third 10 years the forage yield was declined particularly under higher nitrogen fertilizer treatment because the available soil water deceased in 0 1 m soil these results are consistent with jun et al 2014 and wang et al 2012 they reported that the forage yield of alfalfa was lessened on the loess plateau due to the over depletion of deep soil water with the higher fertilizer treatment and longer cultivated periods a higher forage yield indicates a higher consumption of available soil water by ryegrass in the dry land field fessehazion et al 2014 our research has found that the forage yield of ryegrass exhibited a significant correlation with available soil water under n2 and n3 treatments predominantly in 0 50 cm soil layer it was previously reported that 70 93 1 roots of ryegrass distributed in 0 50 cm soil layer kechavarzi et al 2007 which demonstrate that a higher roots distribution in 0 50 cm soil layer possible a reason for the significant correlation between forage yield and available soil water in 0 50 cm soil on the other hand our results are dissimilar with huang et al 2018 they reported a significant correlation between the forage yield of alfalfa grass and available soil water in 80 200 cm soil layer perhaps the alfalfa grass possesses a higher root distribution in deep soil jun et al 2014 or more amount of water available in deep soil on the loess plateau wang et al 2018 root system is one of the important tissues of plant to absorb water and nutrition from soil a higher number of roots enhances the water use capacity of plants earlier research revealed that more than 80 roots of ryegrass distributed in 0 50 cm soil kechavarzi et al 2007 ye et al 2015 our studies unveiled that root biomass and root shoot ratio of ryegrass significantly correlated with available soil water of ryegrass land under n2 and n3 treatments especially in 0 50 cm soil further our findings suggested that the root biomass in 0 30 cm soil affected available soil water in 0 50 cm soil and root biomass in 60 100 cm soil produced a significant impact on available soil water in 60 100 cm soil precipitation is one of the important water sources for ryegrass in dryland field it has a significant impact on available soil water especially in 0 50 cm soil table 2 the available soil water in surface soil is more susceptible to rainfall as compared with deep soil johnsson and jansson 1991 our findings confirmed that the available soil water in 0 50 cm soil has a significant correlation with rainfall in ryegrass land and the correlation index increased with the increase of nitrogen fertilizer from ck to n3 table 2 a large amount of deep soil water consumed by ryegrass due to the relatively low average monthly rainfall only 13 2 mm from january to may therefore available soil water decreased significantly at 0 6 1 0 m soil fig 4 during this period from june to september is the fallow season for artificial ryegrass land at same time rainfall amount of these months were higher than other months therefore soil water in 0 6 1 0 m soil increased from june to september fig 3 this paper confirmed that ryegrass consumed more soil water in 0 6 1 0 m soil from january to may with the increase of nitrogen fertilizer and compared with other fertilizer treatments ryegrass of n3 depleted more soil water in 0 8 1 0 m soil when nitrogen fertilizer increased to 225 kg hm2 the soil water consumed by ryegrass in 0 6 1 0 m soil recovered from june to september during the first 10 years 1981 1990 however it did not recover well during the third 10 years 2001 2010 due to the dry soil layer build in deep soil the available soil water was not enough to relive the water stress therefore water stress days suffered by ryegrass in n3 treatment increased in the third 10 years 2001 2010 than that in the first 10 years fig 6 these results indicated that under n3 treatment a dry soil layer built in deep soil which was not sustainable for the development of artificial ryegrass land considering in a long period 4 3 fertilizer and forage yield in artificial ryegrass land nitrogen fertilization is one of the effective ways to increase forage yield of ryegrass a large number of fertilizer experiments have demonstrated that nitrogen fertilizer can significantly improve forage yield and quality zhan et al 2011 zhou et al 2010 reported that the tiller numbers plant height and leaf area of ryegrass were increased significantly under npk treatments as compared with no nitrogen fertilizer treatment results of this paper showed that with the experimental time went by the effect of nitrogen fertilizer gradually appeared on ryegrass the nitrogen stress days of n3 suffered by ryegrass reduced 10 6 d in the third 10 years 2001 2010 than that in the first 10 years 1981 1990 the nitrogen stress days of ck suffered by ryegrass increased by 12 5 d in the third 10 years than in the first 10 years these results are similar with a previous report huang et al 2010 and also confirmed that the application of nitrogen reduced the negative impacts of nitrogen stress on ryegrass in the artificial ryegrass land in the hilly region of sichuan basin area huang et al 2010 stated that the ryegrass yield significantly increased with the increase of nitrogen application level in fujian province this study shows that the yield of n1 n2 and n3 increased with the increasing of fertilizer use during the first 10 years which is similar to previous studies wilman 1978 agostinetto et al 2017 but the forage yield of n3 was lower than n2 treatment during the third 10 years 2001 2010 this is might because the impacts of water stress during this period fig 6 though the forage yield of n3 was higher than n2 in the first 10 years however higher nitrogen fertilizer often caused a higher nitrate content in forage which is not conducive to the health of livestock cash et al 2006 rashid et al 2018 this means n2 is more sustainable than n3 treatment considering for a long period and the health of animals during 1981 2010 the forage yield of n2 was significantly higher than n1 and its stress days of nitrogen suffered by ryegrass decreased more than n1 therefore n2 treatment is more sustainable than other nitrogen treatments for ryegrass land in sichuan basin area 5 conclusions the epic model can simulate the dynamic changing of soil water well in ryegrass land under different fertilizer treatment considering in a long period with the r value of 0 86 0 95 and rrmse values of 6 0 17 2 in 0 1 0 m soil the r value between simulated and observed values of ryegrass yield was greater than 0 90 and the difference between the me and r2 values was less than 0 02 these results indicated the epic model also simulate ryegrass forage yield well with reasonable fertilizer 150 kg hm2 of nitrogen soil water consumed by ryegrass during january to may period can be recovered well during may to september in the hilly region of sichuan basin area while higher fertilizer 225 kg hm2 of nitrogen built a dry soil layer in 0 8 1 0 m soil and caused higher water stress on ryegrass which was unsustainable for artificial ryegrass land forage yield root shoot ration and root biomass had an impact on available soil water in 0 1 m soil furthermore the root distributed in 0 50 cm soil significantly affected the available soil water in 0 1 m soil roots distributed in 0 20 cm soil affected the available soil water in 0 50 cm soil while root distributed in 60 100 cm soil affected available soil water in deep soil author contributions naseem samo muslim qadir and mengran wang performed experiment analyzed the data and wrote the paper xuechun wang and yungao hu proposed the

10985,to understand the impacts of fertilizer treatment and ryegrass growth on the dynamic changes of soil water is essential to use available soil water and rainfall sagaciously and develop a sustainable artificial ryegrass land in sichuan basin area and the similar areas in the world in the current research the dynamic changes of soil water were measured under different nitrogen fertilizer treatments by field experiment and epic model environment policy integrated climate simulation in the hilly region of sichuan basin area from 2011 to 2015 results revealed that the epic model simulated the dynamic changes of soil water well as the simulated and observed values of forage yield leaf area index and ryegrass height exhibited a good correlation when the nitrogen fertilizer was 150 kg hm2 the soil water consumed by ryegrass during january to may period recovered well during june to september it is more sustainable treatment than other experimental treatments considering in a long period furthermore our simulation demonstrated that the roots especially distributed in 0 50 cm soil has a significant effect on available soil water in 0 1 m soil root distributed in 0 20 cm and 60 100 cm soil affected the available soil water in 0 50 cm and 60 100 cm soil respectively keywords ryegrass epic model forage yield soil water nitrogen fertilizer 1 introduction ryegrass widely cultivated in the world because of its high nutritional value crude protein content of more than 25 song et al 2014 great digestibility liu et al 2009 ruckle et al 2017 good palatability strong cold resistance and other better characteristics förster et al 2018 zhai et al 2013 it is one of the most important cold season forages in the hilly region of sichuan basin area the hilly region of sichuan basin is considered as one of the suitable places to plant forage crops such as ryegrass due to its weather appropriateness with an annual rainfall of 800 1000 mm an annual average temperature of 16 18 c and a frost free period of 230 340 d liang et al 2016 besides the weather reasons building artificial ryegrass land can also reduce soil erosion in the hilly region of sichuan basin where the annual soil erosion module is more than 9800 t km2 a seasonal drought brings serious water stress for ryegrass growth from november to april in sichuan basin region weather record from 1981 to 2016 showed that more than 70 of rainfall took place from june to september pang et al 2010 in the hilly region of sichuan basin while the total precipitation from november to april is not more than 300 mm which is not enough for ryegrass growth without irrigation water deep soil water becomes the vital water source for ryegrass to survive and produce a high forage yield therefore effective and sustainable use of deep soil water becomes one of the hot points for artificial grassland in hilly regions of sichuan basin during 1980 2010 large artificial alfalfa land had built in the hilly region of the loess plateau to feed more livestock animals however due to the excessive depletion of soil water a dry soil layer built in deep soil wang et al 2012 which at last caused the instability of forage yield and hindered the development of livestock animals in that region fang et al 2010 luo et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to clarify the dynamic changes of soil water in deep soil in artificial ryegrass land at least to understand clearly the impacts of ryegrass on soil water changes in a long period in hilly regions of sichuan basin shortage of nitrogen caused by serious soil erosion is another obstacle for artificial ryegrass land in the hilly region of sichuan basin area sharma and chaubey 2017 reported that more than 40 of nitrogen lost from soil by surface runoff directly related to the annual precipitation and fertilization rate similar situation persists in hilly regions of sichuan basin which causes a serious shortage of nitrogen in this area as compared with other forage grass ryegrass needs more nitrogen to grow and build green leaves and tillers chen et al 2013 nitrogen fertilizer is one of the better management to replenish nitrogen need in artificial ryegrass land however too much application of chemical nitrogen fertilizer caused a large output of nitrogen from agricultural land louarn et al 2015 jankowski et al 2018 and also might cause an excessive depletion of soil water in deep soil jankowski et al 2018 hence it s important to elucidate the reasonable use of nitrogen fertilizers in sichuan basin area to avoid the shortage of nitrogen and minimize excessive depletion of water in deep soil crop model simulation as well as long term experiment are two effective methods to investigate the dynamic changes of soil water in deep soil in a long term period as a multi crop model williams et al 1984 the epic model includes more than ten sub modules such as meteorology soil and crop through co operation among various sub modules the epic model can calculate water stress days and nitrogen stress days suffered by ryegrass and can perform long term quantitative simulation for crop growth water cycle and nitrogen cycle well in a complex cropping system he and cai 2016 williams 1990 several researchers have confirmed the accuracy of crop yield and soil moisture simulated by epic model in winter wheat field spring corn field and alfalfa land all model users are agreed that it is necessary to localize and calibrate the epic model before using it for simulation camargo and kemanian 2016 xiong et al 2014 xu et al 2016 at present the epic model was not used in artificial ryegrass land in sichuan basin area objectives of this paper are 1 to investigate the impacts of ryegrass growth on the dynamic changes of soil water in deep soil in the hilly region of sichuan basin area 2 to explore the impacts of nitrogen fertilizer on ryegrass growth and on soil water depletion based on the long term experiment and epic simulation 3 to provide some suggestion for the farmers to use fertilizers and soil water sustainably in artificial land in the hilly region of sichuan basin area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area mianyang n 30 71 33 01 e 103 75 105 72 situated at the middle and upper reaches of fujiang river is a typical hilly region in the northwestern part of sichuan basin more than 78

temperature of 14 7 17 3 the sunshine of 1300 1328 h and the frost free period of 253 301 d the field experiment carried out from 2011 to 2015 at a typical hilly region of sichuan basin area in qingyi town the field experiment site located at one slope farm with a slope rate of 10 the soil of the experimental field was loam clay soil according to the fao soil classiﬁcation standards its thickness ranged from 0 8 m to 1 3 m with the mean value of 1 1 m its bulk density was 1 1 g cm3 with the perennial moisture content of 9 2 10 1 wilting point of 6 2 8 5 and organic matter content of 23 g kg

as followed ck no nitrogen fertilizer n1 75 kg hm2 of nitrogen fertilizer n2 150 kg hm2 of nitrogen fertilizer and n3 225 kg hm2 of nitrogen fertilizer 50 of total nitrogen was applied as basal fertilizer and 50 as top dressed fertilizer 25 in january and 25 in march after harvest 4 treatments with 3 replicates were distributed in 12 plots by randomized block design each plot was 24 m2 with 4 m width and 6 m length a 1 m wide interval between plots designed for sample taking and field management convenience ryegrass planted in mid september with a seeding rate of 15 kg hm2 and a row spacing of 0 15 m and harvested 3 times in january march and may respectively nitrogen fertilizer top dressed into the field according to designed dosage after forage harvest phosphorous fertilizer for all plots was same with 90 kg hm2 p2o5 pesticide and herbicide was used when necessary to eliminate the impacts of plant diseases insect pests and weeds on ryegrass growth 2 2 2 sample collection before planting ryegrass soil samples were collected in 10 cm layers from the soil surface to the depth of 1 m soil at 5 points with 10 samples in each point and soil water content was determined for each layer after ryegrass sowing leaf area index and plant height were measured 2 times in each month while soil water content was measured 1 time each month leaf area index measured by canopy

next the evaluated epic model used to simulate the growth of artificial grass and the dynamic changes of soil water under different nitrogen fertilizer treatments from 1981 to 2010 and output the simulation results for forage yield soil water dynamic changes stress days of nitrogen stress days of water and root growth on the basis of simulation results and field experiment results impacts of fertilizer and ryegrass growth on the dynamic changes of soil water were analyzed in a long period 30 years 2 4 statistical analysis in this study six statistical methods were used to evaluate the performance of epic model as following root mean square error rmse relative root mean square error rrmse relative error re model efficiency me correlation coefficient r coefficient of determination r2 me values are equal to the values of r2 if the values fall around a 1 1 line of simulated versus measured data however me is lower than r2 when the predictions are biased and can be negative ko et al 2009 the soil moisture content effective soil water content plant height and leaf area index of each treatment were averaged over three replicates for statistical analysis available soil water content

williams 1995 3 results and analysis 3 1 evaluation of the epic model comparison results showed that epic model simulated available soil water well in 0 1 m soil of artificial ryegrass land with the rmse of 11 28 mm and r2 of 0 75 0 92 fig 1 a the difference between the simulated and observed values of available soil water was not significant p 0 05 these results indicated the dynamic changes of available soil water simulated by the epic model are acceptable in the statistical range the simulated ryegrass height was not strictly equal to observed value while the r values were greater than 0 90 and the me values were greater than 0 95 fig 1b these results demonstrated that the height of ryegrass simulated by the epic model was accurate simulated leaf area index was similar with observed values with the r2 of 0 76 0 82 and the rmse of 0 09 0 20 furthermore the differences between r2 and me were less than 0 05 fig 2 a these results suggested that the dynamic change of the leaf area index of ryegrass simulated by the epic model was reasonable simulated ryegrass forage yield was 36 5 71 0 t hm2 which was similar to observed forage yield from 2011 to 2015 the epic model simulated forage yield of ryegrass well with the r2 of 0 90 0 96 the rmse of 0 42 0 55 t hm2 and the me of 0 88 0 96 fig 2b 3 2 dynamic changes of soil water in artificial ryegrass land available soil water in 0 1 0 m soil layer fluctuated with the precipitation in artificial ryegrass land during the experimental period fig 3 from june to september monthly precipitation was 120 mm which was significantly higher than other months therefore available soil water in artificial ryegrass land tended to increase from june to september from october to may mean monthly precipitation was 14 2 mm which was significantly lower than other months so available soil water in artificial ryegrass land decreased from october to may during the first 10 years 1981 1990 as compared with ck the monthly available water in 0 1 m soil of n1 n2 and n3 reduced 13 19 and 27 mm respectively meanwhile during the third 10 years 2001 2010 it reduced 14 21 and 53 mm respectively as time went by the available soil water of n1 n2 and n3 decreased more in 0 1 m soil during the third 10 years 2001 2010 than the first 10 years 1981 1990 during the first 10 years 1981 1990 monthly available soil water of n1 n2 and n3 in 0 10 m soil was 164 158 and 150 mm but it was 161 149 and 125 mm respectively in the third 10 years 2001 2010 overall these results displayed that the available soil water in ryegrass land depleted more with an increase of nitrogen fertilizer considering in a long period in the first 10 years 1981 1990 soil water content of n3 in 0 40 cm soil layer fluctuated and decreased due to the rate of precipitation and ryegrass consuming from october to april soil water of n3 in 60 100 cm soil recovered from may to september as the precipitation increased during this period fig 4 a similar results were perceived during third 10 years 2001 2010 in 0 40 cm soil for n3 treatment from october to april however in 80 100 cm soil the soil water not recovered well with the available soil water content of 7 10 fig 4b these results disclosed that soil water in deep soil was over depleted in n3 treatment even built some dry soil layer in 80 100 cm soil 3 3 nitrogen stress days and water stress days suffered by ryegrass nitrogen stress days suffered by ryegrass reduced gradually in n2 and n3 treatment in the first 10 years 1981 1990 nitrogen stress days of n2 and n3 decreased 2 d and 5 d respectively as compared with ck whereas it decreased 13 d and 21 d respectively in the third 10 years 2001 2010 fig 5 these results confirmed that nitrogen fertilizer relieved the negative impacts of nitrogen stress on ryegrass growth in the hilly region of sichuan basin area water stress days of n3 increased from 33 3 d in the first 10 years to 45 3 d in the third 10 years however water stress days of ck and n1 during the third 10 years was not significantly more than the first 10 years fig 5 these results indicated that fertilizer increased depletion of soil water in ryegrass land which increased the water stress days suffered by ryegrass 3 4 root growth in different soil layer during different years in the first and the second 10 years 1981 1990 and 1991 2000 an increasing and decreasing trend in the root biomass was observed this is mainly because of the amount of precipitation in corresponding years during this time the maximum root biomass was detected under n3 treatment fig 6 meanwhile in the third 10 years the root biomass of ck and n3 was lower than n1 and n2 due to nitrogen and water stress suffered by the ck and n3 respectively fig 5 these results indicated that a higher nitrogen treatment n3 depleted more available water in soil which eventually reduced the growth of roots in the third 10 years 2001 2010 in the third 10 years 2001 2010 the total root biomass of ck and n3 in 0 1 0 m soil was significantly lower than that in the first 10 year 1981 1990 due to the nitrogen and water stress suffered by ryegrass fig 5 in the first 10 years available soil water in top soil was relatively plentiful for ryegrass during this period most of root distributed in top soil while during the third 10 years available soil water in top soil consumed by ryegrass and more root developed into the deep soil therefore our results showed that during the third 10 years 2001 2010 the root biomass of n3 and n2 decrease as compared with the first 10 years 1981 1990 in 0 10 cm soil whereas the root biomass of n3 and n2 increased in 60 100 cm soil fig 7 during the third 10 years 2001 2010 compared with that during the first 10 years 1981 1990 also these dynamic changing of root distribution explained why available soil water of n2 and n3 reduced in deep soil during the third 10 years 3 5 forage yield of ryegrass land compared with ck the forage yield of n1 n2 and n3 increased 42 4 75 1 and 92 1 respectively in the first 10 years 1981 1990 similar results were detected in field experiment during 2011 2015 table 1 these findings suggested that equitable use of nitrogen fertilizer could increase forage yield of ryegrass in sichuan basin area however with the time going on the forage yield of ck and n3 both decreased in the third 10 years 2001 2010 as compared to the first 10 years 1981 1990 fig 8 due to the nitrogen stress and water stress suffered by ryegrass fig 5 these results indicated that n3 and ck might not sustainable fertilizer management in sichuan basin area 3 6 correlation analysis the available soil water in 0 1 m soil has a significant correlation with forage yield root shoot ration and root biomass particularly in n2 and n3 treatments the correlation index increased with the increasing of nitrogen fertilizer these findings suggested that forage yield root shoot ration and root biomass had an impact on available soil water in 0 1 m soil and this impact increases with the increase of fertilizers treatment root biomass in 0 10 cm soil and root biomass in 10 20 cm soil exhibited a significant correlation with available soil water in 0 1 m soil not only under n2 and n3 but also under ck and n1 treatments these results demonstrated that the root distribution especially in 0 50 cm soil has a significant effect on available soil water moreover further analysis on available soil water in 0 50 cm and 60 100 cm soil revealed that root in 0 20 cm soil affected the available soil water in 0 50 cm soil while root in 60 100 cm soil affected available soil water in deep soil 4 discussions 4 1 simulation results of the epic model in ryegrass land as an effective tool to calculate the impacts of the environment on agricultural production over a long period the epic model has been evaluated and applied worldwide camargo and kemanian 2016 han et al 2015 steduto et al 1995 wang et al 2015 2011 xiong et al 2014 previous research has confirmed that epic model can simulate the average yield well over a long period he and cai 2016 wang et al 2017 2011 williams 1990 xu et al 2016 yang et al 2019 results of this research unveiled that r values between simulated and observed ryegrass leaf area were greater than 0 90 and me values were all greater than 0 80 similarly the r values between simulated and observed ryegrass forage yield were greater than 0 90 and its me was greater than 0 95 williams 1995 improved the calculation module of groundwater in epic model cavero et al 1998 and lui et al 2000 introduced the baier robertson equation and the green and ampt equation respectively into the epic model these improvements significantly enhanced the simulation accuracy of the epic model for the water cycle in crop production systems results of this study showed that the r value of soil effective water content of 0 1 m soil layer simulated by the epic model was 0 86 0 95 and the rrmse value was 6 0 17 2 the monthly variation of soil water simulated by epic model was similar to the observations these results are consistent with previous studies hao et al 2015 li et al 2010 on the loess plateau overall the results of this paper confirmed the epic model not only can simulate the growth and forage yield of ryegrass well but also can simulate the dynamic changing of soil water in artificial ryegrass land 4 2 dynamic changing of soil water in artificial ryegrass land in the first 10 years the available soil water was sufficient and a higher forage yield was observed under higher nitrogen fertilizer treatment meanwhile during the third 10 years the forage yield was declined particularly under higher nitrogen fertilizer treatment because the available soil water deceased in 0 1 m soil these results are consistent with jun et al 2014 and wang et al 2012 they reported that the forage yield of alfalfa was lessened on the loess plateau due to the over depletion of deep soil water with the higher fertilizer treatment and longer cultivated periods a higher forage yield indicates a higher consumption of available soil water by ryegrass in the dry land field fessehazion et al 2014 our research has found that the forage yield of ryegrass exhibited a significant correlation with available soil water under n2 and n3 treatments predominantly in 0 50 cm soil layer it was previously reported that 70 93 1 roots of ryegrass distributed in 0 50 cm soil layer kechavarzi et al 2007 which demonstrate that a higher roots distribution in 0 50 cm soil layer possible a reason for the significant correlation between forage yield and available soil water in 0 50 cm soil on the other hand our results are dissimilar with huang et al 2018 they reported a significant correlation between the forage yield of alfalfa grass and available soil water in 80 200 cm soil layer perhaps the alfalfa grass possesses a higher root distribution in deep soil jun et al 2014 or more amount of water available in deep soil on the loess plateau wang et al 2018 root system is one of the important tissues of plant to absorb water and nutrition from soil a higher number of roots enhances the water use capacity of plants earlier research revealed that more than 80 roots of ryegrass distributed in 0 50 cm soil kechavarzi et al 2007 ye et al 2015 our studies unveiled that root biomass and root shoot ratio of ryegrass significantly correlated with available soil water of ryegrass land under n2 and n3 treatments especially in 0 50 cm soil further our findings suggested that the root biomass in 0 30 cm soil affected available soil water in 0 50 cm soil and root biomass in 60 100 cm soil produced a significant impact on available soil water in 60 100 cm soil precipitation is one of the important water sources for ryegrass in dryland field it has a significant impact on available soil water especially in 0 50 cm soil table 2 the available soil water in surface soil is more susceptible to rainfall as compared with deep soil johnsson and jansson 1991 our findings confirmed that the available soil water in 0 50 cm soil has a significant correlation with rainfall in ryegrass land and the correlation index increased with the increase of nitrogen fertilizer from ck to n3 table 2 a large amount of deep soil water consumed by ryegrass due to the relatively low average monthly rainfall only 13 2 mm from january to may therefore available soil water decreased significantly at 0 6 1 0 m soil fig 4 during this period from june to september is the fallow season for artificial ryegrass land at same time rainfall amount of these months were higher than other months therefore soil water in 0 6 1 0 m soil increased from june to september fig 3 this paper confirmed that ryegrass consumed more soil water in 0 6 1 0 m soil from january to may with the increase of nitrogen fertilizer and compared with other fertilizer treatments ryegrass of n3 depleted more soil water in 0 8 1 0 m soil when nitrogen fertilizer increased to 225 kg hm2 the soil water consumed by ryegrass in 0 6 1 0 m soil recovered from june to september during the first 10 years 1981 1990 however it did not recover well during the third 10 years 2001 2010 due to the dry soil layer build in deep soil the available soil water was not enough to relive the water stress therefore water stress days suffered by ryegrass in n3 treatment increased in the third 10 years 2001 2010 than that in the first 10 years fig 6 these results indicated that under n3 treatment a dry soil layer built in deep soil which was not sustainable for the development of artificial ryegrass land considering in a long period 4 3 fertilizer and forage yield in artificial ryegrass land nitrogen fertilization is one of the effective ways to increase forage yield of ryegrass a large number of fertilizer experiments have demonstrated that nitrogen fertilizer can significantly improve forage yield and quality zhan et al 2011 zhou et al 2010 reported that the tiller numbers plant height and leaf area of ryegrass were increased significantly under npk treatments as compared with no nitrogen fertilizer treatment results of this paper showed that with the experimental time went by the effect of nitrogen fertilizer gradually appeared on ryegrass the nitrogen stress days of n3 suffered by ryegrass reduced 10 6 d in the third 10 years 2001 2010 than that in the first 10 years 1981 1990 the nitrogen stress days of ck suffered by ryegrass increased by 12 5 d in the third 10 years than in the first 10 years these results are similar with a previous report huang et al 2010 and also confirmed that the application of nitrogen reduced the negative impacts of nitrogen stress on ryegrass in the artificial ryegrass land in the hilly region of sichuan basin area huang et al 2010 stated that the ryegrass yield significantly increased with the increase of nitrogen application level in fujian province this study shows that the yield of n1 n2 and n3 increased with the increasing of fertilizer use during the first 10 years which is similar to previous studies wilman 1978 agostinetto et al 2017 but the forage yield of n3 was lower than n2 treatment during the third 10 years 2001 2010 this is might because the impacts of water stress during this period fig 6 though the forage yield of n3 was higher than n2 in the first 10 years however higher nitrogen fertilizer often caused a higher nitrate content in forage which is not conducive to the health of livestock cash et al 2006 rashid et al 2018 this means n2 is more sustainable than n3 treatment considering for a long period and the health of animals during 1981 2010 the forage yield of n2 was significantly higher than n1 and its stress days of nitrogen suffered by ryegrass decreased more than n1 therefore n2 treatment is more sustainable than other nitrogen treatments for ryegrass land in sichuan basin area 5 conclusions the epic model can simulate the dynamic changing of soil water well in ryegrass land under different fertilizer treatment considering in a long period with the r value of 0 86 0 95 and rrmse values of 6 0 17 2 in 0 1 0 m soil the r value between simulated and observed values of ryegrass yield was greater than 0 90 and the difference between the me and r2 values was less than 0 02 these results indicated the epic model also simulate ryegrass forage yield well with reasonable fertilizer 150 kg hm2 of nitrogen soil water consumed by ryegrass during january to may period can be recovered well during may to september in the hilly region of sichuan basin area while higher fertilizer 225 kg hm2 of nitrogen built a dry soil layer in 0 8 1 0 m soil and caused higher water stress on ryegrass which was unsustainable for artificial ryegrass land forage yield root shoot ration and root biomass had an impact on available soil water in 0 1 m soil furthermore the root distributed in 0 50 cm soil significantly affected the available soil water in 0 1 m soil roots distributed in 0 20 cm soil affected the available soil water in 0 50 cm soil while root distributed in 60 100 cm soil affected available soil water in deep soil author contributions naseem samo muslim qadir and mengran wang performed experiment analyzed the data and wrote the paper xuechun wang and yungao hu proposed the

10986,biofuel demand is on the rise yet there is limited information available about the likely implications of increased planting of cellulosic biofuel crops on water and nutrient fluxes to help address this gap this study quantifies subsurface water nitrate and dissolved phosphorus fluxes below feedstock crops managed for biofuel production on naturally well drained soils in southern wisconsin automated equilibrium tension lysimeters were used to measure subsurface below root zone fluxes of water and nutrients below continuous corn cc monoculture switchgrass sg and hybrid poplar hp cropping systems for three years average water fluxes below sg were nearly double those below cc and hp most of this difference can be linked to seasonal events particularly during late winter and early spring when subsurface water fluxes and increased soil moisture were observed below sg plots likely due to enhanced macropore flow nitrate fluxes were approximately 14 times higher below cc than the 37 4 kg no3 n ha three year annual average observed for sg the nitrate fluxes were negligible below hp despite similar nitrogen application rates the high flux in one of the two cc plots is likely due to excessive manure applications prior to the study period however the nitrate loss potential from cc is much higher than the perennial crops dissolved reactive phosphorus drp concentrations were very low below all three cropping systems average of 0 076 0 083 0 034 mg l in sg cc and hp respectively for the cropping systems evaluated nitrate fluxes were driven by concentration differences in leachate and not influenced by nominal differences in n fertilizer inputs whereas drp fluxes were mainly driven by water fluxes and therefore independent of phosphorus inputs and soil test phosphorus

lysimeter 1 introduction demand for renewable fuel sources in the united states u s is likely to increase over concerns of climate change excessive greenhouse gas emissions and the movement of the country toward energy independence cellulosic biofuels provide promise as a renewable resource that can help meet these demands without direct competition with food sources several cropping systems are being investigated as potential cellulosic biofuel feedstocks including corn zea mays warm season grasses such as switchgrass panicum virgatum and miscanthus miscanthus giganteus and fast growing woody crops such as hybrid poplar poplus heaton et al 2008 carroll and somerville 2009 dohleman and long 2009 blanco canqui 2010 these cropping systems have substantial biomass production potential corn an annual c4 crop is amongst the top three produced tons per year agronomic crops in the world fao 2015 switchgrass is a c4 perennial grass that is native to north america sanderson et al 2006 like corn it has high tolerance to drought nutrient deficiencies and high temperatures zhu et al 2014 although as a perennial it requires less intensive field management than corn under most conditions switchgrass also requires less nitrogen n application than corn although it often responds favorably to n fertilization heaton et al 2009 managed hybrid poplar trees are generally hand planted with 2 5 3 0 m spacing trees are often considered fully established after 2 3 years reach harvest size in 6 to 10 years hansen et al 1995 buhler et al 1998 and re establish from remaining rootstock following harvest poplar has several advantages relative to traditional row crops it requires less fertilizer can be grown on marginally productive soils provides structural and biological diversity in a landscape and gives growers multiple market opportunities ethanol pulp paper solid wood products understanding the potential environmental impacts of producing cellulosic biofuel feedstock crops will be critical to protecting water resources biofuel crops will need to be carefully selected based on region and land use types to fit water availability soils and topography carroll and somerville 2009 and to minimize environmental impacts including excess nutrient delivery to ground and surface waters detailed information is needed about water and nutrient fluxes below different crop types to appropriately parameterize nutrient source models luscz et al 2015 2017 understanding the extent to which previous land management e g manure application influences sub surface nutrient losses in agricultural fields used for biofuel production is also important despite the emerging potential for biofuel crops there are few direct comparisons of subsurface water and nutrient fluxes below such crops multiple studies have investigated portions of the hydrologic budget of feedstock crops managed for biofuel production e g robertson et al 2011 abraha et al 2015 hamilton et al 2015 but have not directly measured subsurface fluxes hamilton et al 2015 reported similar water use evapotranspiration based on soil moisture measurements among corn switchgrass prairie native grasses and hybrid poplar in southern michigan using the soil and water assessment tool swat schilling et al 2008 estimated that conversion of conservation reserve program crp grasslands and pasture to corn in west central iowa would likely increase runoff reduce evapotranspiration and increase streamflow while the opposite was estimated for conversion of crp grasslands and pasture to grasses in wisconsin brye et al 2000 reported total subsurface drainage from corn grown on chisel plowed land was the highest among studied crops 44 of precipitation followed by no till corn 31 and prairie 11 differences in management of traditional versus biofuel feedstock crops impact the quality and quantity of water moving through the soil profile randall et al 1997 christian and riche 1998 mitchell et al 2000 mcisaac and hu 2004 gentry et al 2009 thomas et al 2011 producers may attempt to increase yield through excess crop fertilization and to remove more of the crop residues from the field because the entire plant can be converted to fuel such management choices are important because crop residues left on the surface after harvest can increase water carbon c and nutrient storage within the soil profile kumar and goh 1999 basso et al 2015 cumulative water infiltration and retention in silt loam soils also decreased when less corn residue cover was retained under no till management blanco canqui and lal 2009 nutrient losses to the environment are also likely to vary with production of different potential biofuel feedstock crops mitchell et al 2000 monitored tile drain flows in northern illinois and reported nitrate losses of 3 8 kg n ha yr from perennial grass fields compared to much higher levels 14 35 kg n ha yr from corn cropping systems similarly randall et al 1997 reported flow weighted nitrate concentrations in tile drains in southwest minnesota of 2 mg l under crp grassland compared to 32 and 24 mg l for continuous corn and alfalfa respectively brye et al 2000 reported that corn crops no till and chisel plow tillage resulted in more drainage and more leaching of n and c than prairie ecosystems switchgrass as a biofuel feedstock would likely be grown as a monoculture that has different drainage characteristics than more diverse native or planted prairies smith et al 2013 reported that perennial biofuel crops switchgrass and miscanthus had less nitrate leaching at mid profile and in tile flow than corn corn soybean rotation despite the environmental significance and relevance limited work has been done to directly compare both quantity and quality in subsurface water fluxes from various crops managed as cellulosic biofuel feedstocks within the same environmental conditions few if any studies have used methods that can accurately measure the fluxes of nutrients and water beneath the root zone despite the importance of directly quantifying the potential sustainability of cellulosic biofuel production relative to other uses the objectives of this study were to quantify and compare 1 subsurface below root zone water and nutrient fluxes from continuous corn monoculture switchgrass and hybrid poplar and 2 subsurface losses of n and phosphorus p for the same cropping systems in south central wisconsin unique lysimeter systems were used to continuously monitor vertical fluxes in the field and provide a comparison of three likely candidates for biofuel cropping systems over a three year period 2 methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted at the university of wisconsin uw arlington agricultural research station aars in arlington wisconsin

personnel twelve different biofuel cropping treatments were replicated across the five blocks five plots fig 1 representing three different cropping treatments were selected for this analysis two continuous no till corn cc plots 212 and 411 two monoculture switchgrass sg plots 206 and 412 and one hybrid poplar hp plot 402 the plots have primarily well drained plano silt loam soils with 0 6 slopes the soil profiles have a 10 50 cm thick silt loam a horizon overlaying a 40 75 cm thick silty clay loam b horizon a sand and glacial till c horizon occurred at 80 to 125 cm depth each 27 4 m wide by 42 7 m long plot was subdivided into a main plot section and two edge effect sections the main plot was the middle 18 3 m along the entire length of the plot the 4 6 m east and west edges of the plot were eliminated from agronomic analysis by glbrc personnel to avoid potential yield impacts associated with crop growth near the field edge all subsurface water flux and soil monitoring equipment were installed below or immediately adjacent to the main plot area to limit disturbances associated with installation to the edge areas and not affect the main plot climate data were collected at a weather station at aars which was operated by uw extension as part of the automated weather observation network awon daily precipitation totals measured with a heated tipping bucket rain gauge and average air temperatures for the study period were downloaded from the awon network website https agweather cals wisc edu awon 2 2 crop management crops were managed according to uw extension recommendations for planting and harvesting along with pesticide herbicide and fertilizer application rates corn was planted annually with a starter fertilizer then additional 28 urea ammonium nitrate fertilizer was applied as a side dressing four to six weeks after planting depending on weather conditions switchgrass and hybrid poplar were planted in 2008 all corn was planted with no till practices switchgrass was harvested annually while poplar was harvested every 5 years with the first harvest in december 2013 during harvest the hybrid poplar stumps were left in place to allow for regeneration in subsequent years the areas above the lysimeters were protected from foot and equipment traffic all field operations harvest planting fertilizing etc in the 1 m2 area above each lysimeter were done by hand the planting harvest and fertilizer dates along with application rates are included in table s1 supplementary information 2 3 water and nutrient flux measurements automated equilibrium tension lysimeters aetls e g kosugi and katsuyama 2004 masarik et al 2004 barkle et al 2011 stenjem 2013 were used to measure subsurface water fluxes below the root zone of each cropping system the aetls utilized suction to sample water draining through the soil profile directly above the lysimeter unlike traditional suction lysimeters the suction was automatically matched to the measured soil water tension in the surrounding soil at the depth of the lysimeter to minimize convergent or divergent flows to around the lysimeter bulk soil water tension was measured with a heat dissipation tensiometer every 10 min campbell scientific 299 water matric potential sensor as measured soil conditions changed the systems pumped air from the lysimeter or bled air into the system to automatically adjust the pore potential of the porous plate these systems were thus more likely to accurately capture important subsurface water flux events e g during snow melt periods and large rainstorms without manual intervention this autonomous feature was beneficial as the field site was 20 miles away from uw madison campus and thus not accessible for manual operation during rapidly varying soil moisture conditions for the three cropping systems evaluated in this study intra plot replicates two lysimeters were installed in plots 206 sg 402 hp and 411 cc see fig 1 for locations inter plot replication was achieved by installing one lysimeter in an additional cc 212 and sg 412 plot each lysimeter is 25 cm wide by 75 cm long by 15 cm tall 28 1 l capacity and was constructed of 1 6 mm thick stainless steel a 1 mm thick porous stainless steel top with 0 2 μm diameter pores with air entry pressure of 60 kpa mott metallurgical corporation farmington ct allowed water to flow from the soil into the lysimeter lysimeters were installed beneath undisturbed soil profiles by excavating a cavity 0 9 m wide by 0 5 m high by 0 6 m deep into the wall of large soil pits 3 m long by 1 5 m wide and 2 m deep the top surface of the lysimeter was positioned such that it was just above the interface of the clay loam b and sandy c horizons in contact with the soil cavity for this study any water leaving the b horizon was considered representative of water that would eventually reach the water table because of spatial variations in soil horizons determined visually within soil pits the lysimeter depths varied among and within plots from 80 to 195 cm see table s2 while each cropping system can have effective rooting depths deeper than the top of our lysimeter installation in some soils several lines of evidence indicate the vast majority of water and nutrient uptake occurred above these depths 1 the fine to coarse transition from b to c at this site encourages water and nutrient retention in the b horizon which root systems tend to mimic 2 even when rooting depths are greater the fraction of roots in deeper layers is typically quite low following a decreasing exponential profile with depth and 3 the lack of organic c and soil development in the c horizon indicate that prior vegetation had very low root densities below our lysimeter installations two sheets of filter paper 0 5 μm and 1 0 μm pargreen process technologies addison il were placed on top of the porous plate to help maintain moisture near the plate during dry periods and prevent clogging of pores by clay particles the lysimeter was placed on a spring plate and a 0 64 cm thick aluminum plate provided a strong level base on the floor of the cavity for the lysimeter set up two hydraulic jacks and additional scissor jacks were positioned under the spring plate several 8 9 cm by 8 9 cm wooden blocks were placed inside of the spring plate to prevent compression of the springs while the lysimeter was being pushed into the ceiling of the cavity the jacks were raised until there was complete contact between the soil and the lysimeter surface and the collar of the lysimeter pressed 2 3 cm into the cavity ceiling care was taken to not over apply pressure which could damage the equipment several pressure treated wooden blocks were placed between the base plate on the cavity floor and the bottom of the spring plate to support the lysimeter and maintain contact with the soil stainless steel 6 3 mm tubing was connected to both the sample and vacuum ports at the lysimeter and extended from the lysimeter to outside the cavity where rubber tubing was attached and extended to the soil surface multiple electric tensiometers model 229 campbell scientific logan ut were installed in the soil profile of each monitored plot a single tensiometer was installed directly above the porous plate of each lysimeter to monitor any lysimeter effect on the soil water tension an additional tensiometer was installed in each plot to set the suction in the system in plots with a single lysimeter the control tensiometer was installed in undisturbed soil at the same depth as the lysimeter 15 20 cm away from the edge of the plate in plots with multiple lysimeters the control tensiometer was installed in undisturbed soil at the average depth of the lysimeters approximately halfway between the units soil water content was measured with water content reflectometers cs616 campbell scientific logan ut with 300 mm long probes that were installed horizontally into the soil profile at 20 and 65 cm depths a site specific calibration curve was developed for the water content sensors by field calibrating in the soil b horizon at several locations on site as described in the manufacturer literature cambpell scientific 2006 a single calibration curve was applied to all of the water content sensors temperature was measured using type t copper constantine thermocouples at 20 cm depth in all plots and with the thermocouple included with each tensiometer installed at the lysimeter depth all wires tubes were bundled inside a horizontal pvc pipe buried approximately 30 cm deep connected to a control box outside the plot the control box consisted of a datalogger 10x 23x or cr1000 campbell scientific logan ut to run the control program and record soil sensors an excitation module to heat the tensiometers pneumatic valves operated by a 12 v relay driver to control pumping and bleeding and a pump to pull air from the lysimeter datalogger programs were executed every 10 min to i measure matric potential moisture content and temperature ii monitor and set appropriate suction in the lysimeter and iii store hourly averages of all data the aetl systems were designed and installed as described in brye et al 1999 and the automated control systems were designed and calibrated as described by masarik et al 2004 2 4 sample collection and analysis leachate samples were collected from each lysimeter reservoir weekly during wet periods generally spring and early summer and bi weekly during dry periods late summer fall and winter to ensure sufficient volumes for nutrient analyses due to differences in installation dates and troubleshooting periods data collection start times for each lysimeter varied table s2 prior to sampling all vacuum hoses were disconnected from the control box to prevent suction applied during sampling from drawing water from the soil profile into the lysimeter samples were collected from the lysimeter using a ½ hp vacuum pump and 0 75 l vacuum trap the initial 750 ml of water flushed the vacuum trap and sample hoses and was discarded up to another 750 ml was then collected split and sub sampled for nutrient analyses a sample volume of 125 ml was acid preserved using 2 ml of 20 mm h2so4 for nitrate plus nitrite no3 no2 reported as no3 n ammonium n nh4 n total n tn and total p tp analyses an additional 120 ml was divided into two 60 ml aliquots one of which was field filtered 0 45 μm whatman puradisc filter ge healthcare piscataway nj for dissolved reactive p drp analysis the second 60 ml sample was analyzed for ph and electrical conductivity ec all remaining water was pumped from the lysimeter and the total volume was recorded during dry periods when less than 750 ml of water was present in the lysimeter no nutrient analyses were conducted as sample contamination was possible due to insufficient flush volume samples were analyzed in the environmental quality laboratory in the department of biological systems engineering uw madison 2 5 data analysis two types of analyses were completed to better understand water and nutrient dynamics below different biofuel crops 1 water and nutrient fluxes for each sampling period were accumulated over the study period to illustrate temporal variations within and among cropping systems and 2 average water and nutrient fluxes were calculated for each treatment over annual and seasonal periods the variance for each period was calculated across all sampling dates during the study one of the two lysimeters in plot 411 failed and was repaired during the study as a result no drainage measurements were obtained from that lysimeter between 18 november 2011 and 27 march 2012 the corresponding replicate was thus excluded from the treatment average and variance calculations during that period all other sensors in the plot functioned for the entire project period start and end dates for each season table s3 were based on climatic conditions air and soil temperatures and sampling dates to maintain similar length seasonal periods annual periods table s3 were selected to fully capture spring snowmelt within a single monitoring period all annual periods begin in may around the time of corn planting and extend for 12 months through the following spring melt in march or april of all years during the study this period was selected to maximize the amount of available data for comparison given that the monitoring period began in april 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 climatic conditions precipitation and air temperature during the study period 1 april 2011 to 30 june 2014 there was 276 9 cm of total precipitation with fig 2 showing annual cumulative precipitation compared to the 30 year annual average 1981 2010 for arlington wi importantly this 3 year period covered seasons with below average 2012 19 6 cm less near normal 2011 8 3 cm less and above average 2013 10 3 cm more precipitation monthly air temperatures were closest within 2 c to average in 2011 fig 3 there was one anomalously warm period january through july 2012 air temperature 3 3 c above average and one cold period december 2013 to april 2014 4 4 c below average therefore this study encompassed a wide range in precipitation and temperature 3 2 subsurface water flux cumulative annual and seasonal in wisconsin december 1st through march 31st generally coincides with average soil freezing and thawing dates subsurface water fluxes occur episodically during the winter following substantial snow melt events more regularly at the onset of spring thaw and continue through the early growing season corn is typically planted the first week of may as et demand increases throughout the growing season subsurface fluxes decrease which is supported by our direct observations substantially more subsurface water flux was measured in sg plots than in cc or hp plots during the study fig 4 over the 1070 day study period beginning 20 july 2011 average cumulative water fluxes were 114 5 69 3 and 55 5 cm for sg cc and hp respectively or 48 4 29 3 and 23 5 of the total precipitation differences in flux among the cropping systems was most pronounced in late winter or early spring the majority of the subsurface water flux in all treatments occurred between spring thaw through the early growing season march through june fig 4 little water flux occurred between the peak of the growing season through harvest typically june through october from july 2011 through december 2012 precipitation was nearly 30 cm below normal with little snowfall during this period very little water flux occurred in hp 4 3 cm while sg flux 39 8 cm exceeded cc flux 24 3 cm by 63 generally almost no subsurface water flux was measured under frozen soil conditions in any treatment two exceptions were observed in the sg treatment snow melt events in february 2012 and january 2013 resulted in an average of 9 3 and 15 4 cm of water flux respectively from the sg treatments fig 4 that was not observed in cc and hp plots despite the close proximity and comparable snow depths similarly an early spring flux event during april 2014 was much more pronounced in sg than in either cc or hp there appears to be little difference in antecedent soil moisture conditions during the winter season according to available soil moisture data from these plots published in parish et al 2019 instead these enhanced fluxes are suspected to be the result of flow through macropores rather than bulk flow through the soil due to the frozen ground conditions macropores allow water to bypass large portions of the soil matrix enabling rapid infiltration even when soil frost is present mohammed et al 2018 and perennial grasslands can have much higher frozen soil infiltrability due to the presence of macropores compared to croplands van der kamp et al 2003 early in the study water flux measured below the hp plot was consistently lower than below the sg and cc plots however in early spring 2013 and 2014 higher precipitation rates combined with greater snowpack water storage in the hp plots during 2013 table s4 resulted in similar fluxes among hp sg and cc plots the hp plots were harvested during december 2013 and allowed to regrow starting the following spring which may explain higher water flux rates in hp during spring 2014 relative to other seasons as the crop re established likely reducing total evapotranspiration water flux from sg plots was substantially greater than from cc and hp during all three annual periods fig 5 differences among the cropping systems were greatest from may 2011 through april 2012 when fluxes from sg cc and hp measured 55 39 and 6 of the total precipitation 77 1 cm respectively the proportion of precipitation draining from sg and cc was similar for the following two periods between may 2012 through april 2013 46 and 29 of precipitation 70 5 cm respectively and between may 2013 through april 2014 46 and 27 of precipitation 85 0 cm respectively despite approximately 20 more precipitation in the latter year water flux in hp plots was more variable within and across the comparison periods likely due to enhanced snow drifting in some years and harvesting of the hp in 2013 relative rankings among the treatments varied considerably by season fig 6 water flux from sg plots was generally greater than both cc and hp plots in winter and spring except in spring 2013 when all treatments were similar and winter 2014 when there was very little flux very little flux occurred below any treatment in the summer or fall seasons when et would be greatest preventing most infiltrated precipitation from reaching the lysimeter below the root zone any subsurface flux that occurred in summer did so early in the season and the only fall season with any measured water flux occurred in 2011 due to relatively high precipitation in fall that year approximately 40 more precipitation than the next wettest fall some of the differences in water flux between cc and sg plots may be due to differences in crop residue management after harvest and before planting far less residue remained on the soil surface in cc plots than in the sg plots reduced surface cover increases the potential for surface crusting in no till annual cropping systems potentially resulting in more runoff and reduced infiltration compared to perennial cropping systems brye et al 2000 blanco canqui and lal 2007 2009 polich 2014 measured runoff from the cc and sg plots used in our study and reported higher runoff generation from cc compared to sg with greater differences before planting and early in the growing season soil physical characteristics in the cc plots including compaction lower bulk density and less macropores may have also decreased the flux from cc relative to sg plots no till production may reduce soil compaction and promote infiltration and subsurface drainage however additional field operations associated with stover collection for biofuel production may reduce these benefits wilhelm et al 2004 densely rooted warm season grasses such as switchgrass can improve soil structural properties compared to row crops and thereby increase infiltration capacity and hydraulic conductivity blanco canqui 2010 switchgrass has been found to have more prevalent macropores rachman et al 2004 and deeper roots tufekcioglu et al 1998 than corn switchgrass can reduce soil bulk density over time due to increased root biomass near the soil surface relative to annual corn and soybeans frank et al 2004 murphy et al 2004 rachman et al 2004 increasing infiltration capacity schmer et al 2011 showed switchgrass managed for biofuel production in north and south dakota u s significantly decreased soil bulk density up to 0 2 m depth following years of corn or soybean production the changes in soil bulk density occurred mostly in the top 5 cm of soil where the influence of plant biomass inputs management and freeze thaw cycles are greatest small plot 1 m2 runoff from sg plot 412 and cc plot 411 was measured within the same plots in a companion study during 2011 polich 2014 combined runoff for july august and september 2011 was 88 less for sg 0 9 cm compared to cc 7 8 cm indicating greater infiltration capacity for sg compared to cc below the first few cm of soil the role of macropores may be particularly important for sg as discussed above particularly during otherwise frozen ground periods overall there was less water flux below hp plots than beneath cc and sg plots the uncharacteristically high spring flux in hp plots during 2013 which was similar to both cc and sg appears to have been driven more by snow drift accumulation and melt compared to the other treatments snow water equivalent over the lysimeters was measured several times during 2012 and 2013 table s4 substantial snow drifting occurred during january march 2013 with the greatest depths in the hp plot followed by sg with very little drifting in the cc plots this results from standing trees relative to very little vegetative coverage in the other plots snow water equivalent depths varied by 4 cm between cc and sg plots on all measurement dates largest differences january through march 2013 while snow water equivalent depth in the hp plot was as much as 20 cm greater e g march 2013 than in either the cc or sg plots flux from the hp plot in 2013 was much higher compared to the 2012 melt period when no drifting was observed snow depth was not measured in 2014 however minimal differences in drifting were observed among the plots because the hp plots were harvested during december 2013 a wet spring combined with the hp re establishment likely contributed to higher flux in the hp plot in 2014 compared to spring 2012 snowmelt runoff was not quantified during the study due to logistical issues differences in runoff among the plots were assumed to be minimal as there is very little slope within the monitored plots 2 and in 2013 and 2014 ground cover among plots was most similar after hp harvest 3 3 nutrient fluxes nitrogen typically 99 of the total n loads from all treatments was in the form of nitrate nitrite n no2 n concentrations were below 0 25 mg l in all analyzed samples ammonium n nh4 n concentrations also were extremely low throughout the study over 80 of the samples analyzed had concentrations below the analytical detection limit 0 02 mg l therefore only nitrate n no3 n transport is discussed nitrate concentrations fig 7 table s5 were considerably higher in cc plots than sg plots during the study period no3 n concentrations were below the detection limit 0 25 mg no3 n l in the hp plot for most of the study period during the study period the total flux measured in the three cc plots was 640 5 517 8 and 403 2 kg no3 n ha 10 20 times more than measured from the three sg plots 56 5 34 5 and 21 2 kg no3 n ha and approximately 500 times greater than the total fluxes measured from hp 1 4 and 0 4 kg no3 n ha the majority of the no3 n flux occurred during winter and spring months in all cropping systems especially in the cc plots fig 7 during a single three month period march may 2012 the no3 n flux measured from cc plots 411n and 411s totaled 267 9 and 173 6 kg no3 n ha respectively both totals are greater than the total measured flux from any non cc plot during the entire three year study period the differences in no3 n flux measured among cropping systems were primarily driven by differences in concentrations fig 7 rather than total water flux fig 4 though there was some variability across the cc plots concentrations were consistently 5 10 times greater in cc than sg with that difference decreasing over time concentration differences were affected by the three different n fertilizer management regimes among the treatments 1 hp plots received no n fertilizer applications 2 sg plots were fertilized at the same rate 56 kg n ha every growing season and 3 cc plots were fertilized with n at rates recommended by uw extension literature based on pre planting soil test results 21 72 kg n ha during the study differences in no3 n leachate concentrations were large relative to the differences in nominal n application the high no3 n fluxes for cc plots early in this study are at least partly due to legacy effects of historic manure applications to this particular field prior to establishment of the glbrc plots the fields received intensive application of liquid hog manure for several years glbrc personnel indicated that application amounts were different across the field blocks 1 3 plots 206 and 212 received individual applications on the order of 2000 gallons compared to 18 000 45 000 gallons in blocks 4 5 plots 402 411 and 412 however the complete details of the manure applications are not known personal communication with glbrc personnel two of three cc lysimeters plot 411n and 411s and one of three sg lysimeters 412 were located in the area of heavy manure application during the second monitored growing season no3 n concentrations measured from the two cc lysimeters in plot 411 were frequently 2 3 times higher than those measured in plot 212 fig 7 differences among the cc replicates were less pronounced throughout the rest of the study intra treatment variations in no3 n concentrations were not as apparent in sg and hp this may explain some of the differences observed between the concentrations of no3 n among cc plots 411n 411s and 212 during the study warm conditions in early 2012 may have been more favorable for n mineralization leading to greater n release in plot 411 than 212 as more legacy n was available additionally spring pre planting soil test data from 2010 through 2012 in plot 411 table s6 provided by glbrc in conjunction with the fertilizer application data table s1 supports the notion that n was likely over applied in plot 411 in 2011 in 2011 n application rates in plot 411 73 kg n ha were higher than any other year in the study despite the plot having the highest measured pre planting soil no3 n concentration 19 mg kg soil that year no3 n concentrations decreased from late 2011 through spring 2013 as n application rates were lower after 2011 the other dissolved constituents measured but not reported here do not exhibit the same high initial and declining pattern of concentrations over time in 2011 and 2012 the no3 n concentrations in plot 411 exceeded 100 mg l similar to levels found by gehl et al 2005 in irrigated corn plots on sandy soils fertilized at 285 kg n ha or greater after spring 2012 no3 n concentrations from cc plots were within the ranges measured by owens 1990 and andraski et al 2000 which had similar fertilizer strategies and soils to this study the relative ranking of the soluble subsurface n losses from cc and sg and the finding that differences in n losses between cc and sg were greater than the difference in n applied to cc and sg agree with the model results of leduc et al 2016 the authors reported annual nitrate leachate losses of 13 5 kg n ha from no till corn with residue removed compared to 0 2 kg n ha for switchgrass using the environmental policy integrated climate model for converted crp land in iowa in that study simulated n fertilizer application rates for corn and switchgrass were 140 kg n ha and 60 kg n ha respectively while the leachate losses reported by leduc et al 2016 are lower than those measured in this study there are some important differences between the two studies a the crp lands would not have a similar legacy of manure application like we had for our study sites b the aforementioned crp lands covered a wider range of slopes that are much steeper than the relatively flat fields in our work so they observed considerable surface n losses in runoff 44 7 kg n ha from no till corn with residue removed and 13 kg n ha for switchgrass phosphorus sub surface transport of p in all three cropping systems was dominated by the dissolved p form all samples had tp concentrations below the detection limit of 0 5 mg p l since the leachate passes through 1 0 and 0 5 μm filter papers prior to entering the lysimeter virtually no particulates were expected to be present in the leachate annual drp flux from the sg plots was greater than that from cc plots in two of the three years studied 2011 2012 and 2013 2014 vs 2012 2013 while fluxes from sg and cc plots were higher than from the hp plot during all three years fig 5 seasonal drp fluxes in all cropping systems during the study were below 0 30 kg ha with differences among cropping systems dependent on season as was the case with no3 n the majority of the total drp flux in each plot tended to occur over a brief period of time fig 8 nearly 33 of the total drp flux in sg plots 206n and 206s occurred during a single sampling interval in february 2012 unlike no3 n flux the differences in drp flux between cc and sg were driven primarily by the total water flux and not the drp concentration this pattern was particularly evident during snowmelt events in spring 2011 and winter spring 2012 drp concentrations in sg 0 06 0 11 mg l were 2 to 3 times greater than in cc 0 02 0 06 mg l however the drp flux in sg 0 62 1 17 kg ha was up to 6 times that of cc 0 21 0 88 kg ha during these periods there was considerably more water flux through the soil profile in sg plots than cc brye et al 2002 hypothesized that much of dissolved p moving through the soil profile did so via macropore flow rather than through the bulk soil matrix thus an increase in water flux from a treatment is likely to increase potential for p transport through the soil profile this agrees well with the observations of the current study with higher drp concentrations measured in leachate from sg treatments in spring and winter months when sg plots had the highest water flux rate particularly in relatively large pulses during february 2012 macropore flow may also help explain why despite higher soil test p levels in cc plots higher p fluxes were measured in the sg treatments the average drp concentrations observed in this study were similar to total dissolved p tdp concentrations in leachate reported by brye et al 2002 in prairie and various corn treatments at arlington wi brye et al 2002 reported average tdp concentrations january to september from no till corn and chisel plowed corn of 0 056 mg l and 0 036 mg l respectively and from corn fertilized with n 180 kg n ha and unfertilized corn of 0 079 mg l and 0 014 mg l respectively soil test data 2008 2011 obtained from glbrc personnel show bray 1 p levels in the top 10 cm of approximately 120 ppm in the hp plot 160 240 ppm in sg plots and 210 270 ppm in cc plots brye et al 2002 report bray 1 soil p top 10 cm of 100 ppm or less in all treatments due to the immobile nature of p in the soil profile it is reasonable to assume that only minor differences in dissolved p would be present deeper in the profile despite the differences in soil test p between the studies soil test data indicate very little change in soil p concentrations in hp sg and cc plots over the first several years after biofuel crop establishment due to a long history of manure application at aars site of this study differences in drp leaching resulting from current biofuel p management are not likely to be observed for several more years 4 conclusions more water flux was measured from sg than any other treatment over the study period cumulative subsurface water flux as a percent of the total precipitation below sg was nearly twice that measured below cc and hp the majority of water flux from all cropping systems occurred during late winter and early spring when soils had higher soil moisture levels water movement through the soil profile in sg was characterized by intense late winter and early spring flux events likely dominated by macroporous flow very little water flux was measured from hp prior to the first harvest during the first year of regrowth water fluxes were generally similar to the other cropping systems nitrate no3 n fluxes from cc were very high relative to sg and hp concentrations of no3 n were up to 10 times higher below cc than sg despite n application rates that were similar between the two cropping systems intense manure application prior to our study period may be responsible for very high initial no3 n flux from cc plots the difference between measured no3 n concentrations in cc and sg decreased by the conclusion of the study however the sg treatments still had much lower no3 n flux than cc no3 n flux from hp was very low with concentrations undetectable for the majority of the study no n was applied to the crop overall results indicate that cc in this environment appears to be much more susceptible to nitrate leaching than the perennial crops studied phosphorus losses were very low from all three cropping systems the measured flux was driven primarily by differences in total water flux among the cropping systems and not differences in leachate p concentrations due to the relatively immobile nature of p and low p fertilizer application rates during the study there was no apparent correlation between the cropping system and p concentrations in subsurface water higher up to 6 times drp fluxes were measured in the sg treatments compared to the cc treatments this greater p transport is likely because of greater macroporous flow in sg results from this study indicate that subsurface water and nutrient losses to the environment vary seasonally and among nutrients and are dependent on crop and management for the cropping systems evaluated no3 n fluxes were driven by concentration differences and not influenced by nominal differences in n fertilizer inputs whereas drp fluxes were mainly driven by water fluxes and therefore independent of p inputs and soil test p monitoring efforts serendipitously captured the legacy of excessive fertilization from prior manure applications which is likely to be a common scenario for agricultural fields used for biofuel production

10986,biofuel demand is on the rise yet there is limited information available about the likely implications of increased planting of cellulosic biofuel crops on water and nutrient fluxes to help address this gap this study quantifies subsurface water nitrate and dissolved phosphorus fluxes below feedstock crops managed for biofuel production on naturally well drained soils in southern wisconsin automated equilibrium tension lysimeters were used to measure subsurface below root zone fluxes of water and nutrients below continuous corn cc monoculture switchgrass sg and hybrid poplar hp cropping systems for three years average water fluxes below sg were nearly double those below cc and hp most of this difference can be linked to seasonal events particularly during late winter and early spring when subsurface water fluxes and increased soil moisture were observed below sg plots likely due to enhanced macropore flow nitrate fluxes were approximately 14 times higher below cc than the 37 4 kg no3 n ha three year annual average observed for sg the nitrate fluxes were negligible below hp despite similar nitrogen application rates the high flux in one of the two cc plots is likely due to excessive manure applications prior to the study period however the nitrate loss potential from cc is much higher than the perennial crops dissolved reactive phosphorus drp concentrations were very low below all three cropping systems average of 0 076 0 083 0 034 mg l in sg cc and hp respectively for the cropping systems evaluated nitrate fluxes were driven by concentration differences in leachate and not influenced by nominal differences in n fertilizer inputs whereas drp fluxes were mainly driven by water fluxes and therefore independent of phosphorus inputs and soil test phosphorus

lysimeter 1 introduction demand for renewable fuel sources in the united states u s is likely to increase over concerns of climate change excessive greenhouse gas emissions and the movement of the country toward energy independence cellulosic biofuels provide promise as a renewable resource that can help meet these demands without direct competition with food sources several cropping systems are being investigated as potential cellulosic biofuel feedstocks including corn zea mays warm season grasses such as switchgrass panicum virgatum and miscanthus miscanthus giganteus and fast growing woody crops such as hybrid poplar poplus heaton et al 2008 carroll and somerville 2009 dohleman and long 2009 blanco canqui 2010 these cropping systems have substantial biomass production potential corn an annual c4 crop is amongst the top three produced tons per year agronomic crops in the world fao 2015 switchgrass is a c4 perennial grass that is native to north america sanderson et al 2006 like corn it has high tolerance to drought nutrient deficiencies and high temperatures zhu et al 2014 although as a perennial it requires less intensive field management than corn under most conditions switchgrass also requires less nitrogen n application than corn although it often responds favorably to n fertilization heaton et al 2009 managed hybrid poplar trees are generally hand

carroll and somerville 2009 and to minimize environmental impacts including excess nutrient delivery to ground and surface waters detailed information is needed about water and nutrient fluxes below different crop types to appropriately parameterize nutrient source models luscz et al 2015 2017 understanding the extent to which previous land management e g manure application influences sub surface nutrient losses in agricultural fields used for biofuel production is also important despite the emerging potential for biofuel crops there are few direct comparisons of subsurface water and nutrient fluxes below such crops multiple studies have investigated portions of the hydrologic budget of feedstock crops managed for biofuel production e g robertson et al 2011 abraha et al 2015 hamilton et al

grasses and hybrid poplar in southern michigan using the soil and water assessment tool swat schilling et al 2008 estimated that conversion of conservation reserve program crp grasslands and pasture to corn in west central iowa would likely increase runoff reduce evapotranspiration and increase streamflow while the opposite was estimated for conversion of crp grasslands and pasture to grasses in wisconsin brye et al 2000 reported total subsurface drainage from corn grown on chisel plowed land was the highest among studied crops 44 of precipitation followed by no till corn 31 and prairie 11 differences in management of traditional versus biofuel feedstock crops impact the quality and quantity of water moving through the soil profile randall et al 1997 christian and riche 1998 mitchell et al 2000 mcisaac and hu 2004 gentry et al 2009 thomas et al 2011 producers may attempt to increase yield through excess crop fertilization and to remove more of the crop residues from the field because the entire plant can be converted to fuel such management choices are important because crop residues left on the surface after harvest can increase water carbon c and nutrient storage within the soil profile kumar and goh 1999 basso et al 2015 cumulative water infiltration and retention in silt loam soils also decreased when less corn residue cover was retained under no till management blanco canqui and lal 2009 nutrient losses to the environment are also likely to vary with production of different potential biofuel feedstock crops mitchell et al 2000 monitored tile drain flows in northern illinois and reported nitrate losses of 3 8 kg n ha yr from perennial grass fields compared to much higher levels 14 35 kg n ha yr from corn cropping systems similarly randall et al 1997 reported flow weighted nitrate concentrations in tile drains in southwest minnesota of 2 mg l under crp grassland compared to 32 and 24 mg l for continuous corn and alfalfa respectively brye et al 2000 reported that corn crops no till and chisel plow tillage resulted in more drainage and more leaching of n and c than prairie ecosystems switchgrass as a biofuel feedstock would likely be grown as a monoculture that has different drainage characteristics than more diverse native or planted prairies smith et al 2013 reported that perennial biofuel crops switchgrass and miscanthus had less nitrate leaching at mid profile and in tile flow than corn corn soybean rotation despite the environmental significance and relevance limited work has been done to directly compare both quantity and quality in subsurface water fluxes from various crops managed as cellulosic biofuel feedstocks within the same environmental conditions few if any studies have used methods that can accurately measure the fluxes of nutrients and water beneath the root zone despite the importance of directly quantifying the potential sustainability of cellulosic biofuel production relative to other uses the objectives of this study were to quantify and compare 1 subsurface below root zone water and nutrient fluxes from continuous corn monoculture switchgrass and hybrid poplar and 2 subsurface losses of n and phosphorus p for the same cropping systems in south central wisconsin unique lysimeter systems were used to continuously monitor vertical fluxes in the field and provide a comparison of three likely candidates for biofuel cropping systems over a three year period 2 methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted at the university of wisconsin uw arlington agricultural research station aars in arlington wisconsin fig 1 average annual precipitation at the site is 83 7 cm nearly half 40 1 cm of which generally falls from june through september sixty experimental plots were established at this site in a randomized complete block design five blocks each containing twelve plots near the southwest corner of the research station in the spring of 2008 by usdoe great lakes bioenergy research center glbrc personnel twelve different biofuel cropping treatments were replicated across the five blocks five plots fig 1 representing three different cropping treatments were selected for this analysis two continuous no till corn cc plots 212 and 411 two monoculture switchgrass sg plots 206 and 412 and one hybrid poplar hp plot 402 the plots have primarily well drained plano silt loam soils with 0 6 slopes the soil profiles have a 10 50 cm thick silt loam a horizon overlaying a 40 75 cm thick silty clay loam b horizon a sand and glacial till c horizon occurred at 80 to 125 cm depth each 27 4 m wide by 42 7 m long plot was subdivided into a main plot section and two edge effect sections the main plot was the middle 18 3 m along the entire length of the plot the 4 6 m east and west edges of the plot were eliminated from agronomic analysis by glbrc personnel to avoid potential yield impacts associated with crop growth near the field edge all subsurface water flux and soil monitoring equipment were installed below or immediately adjacent to the main plot area to limit disturbances associated with installation to the edge areas and not affect the main plot climate data were collected at a weather station at aars which was operated by uw extension as part of the automated weather observation network awon daily precipitation totals measured with a heated tipping bucket rain gauge and average air temperatures for the study period were downloaded from the awon network website https agweather cals wisc edu awon 2 2 crop management crops were managed according to uw extension recommendations for planting and harvesting along with pesticide herbicide and fertilizer application rates corn was planted annually with a starter fertilizer then additional 28 urea ammonium nitrate fertilizer was applied as a side dressing four to six weeks after planting depending on weather conditions switchgrass and hybrid poplar were planted in 2008 all corn was planted with no till practices switchgrass was harvested annually while poplar was harvested every 5 years with the first harvest in december 2013 during harvest the hybrid poplar stumps were left in place to allow for regeneration in subsequent years the areas above the lysimeters were protected from foot and equipment traffic all field operations harvest planting fertilizing etc in the 1 m2 area above each lysimeter were done by hand the planting harvest and fertilizer dates along with application rates are included in table s1 supplementary information 2 3 water and nutrient flux measurements automated equilibrium tension lysimeters aetls e g kosugi and katsuyama 2004 masarik et al 2004 barkle et al 2011 stenjem 2013 were used to measure subsurface water fluxes below the root zone of each cropping system the aetls utilized suction to sample water draining through the soil profile directly above the lysimeter unlike traditional suction lysimeters the suction was automatically matched to the measured soil water tension in the surrounding soil at the depth of the lysimeter to minimize convergent or divergent flows to around the lysimeter bulk soil water tension was measured with a heat dissipation tensiometer every 10 min campbell scientific 299 water matric potential sensor as measured soil conditions changed the systems pumped air from the lysimeter or bled air into the system to automatically adjust the pore potential of the porous plate these systems were thus more likely to accurately capture important subsurface water flux events e g during snow melt periods and large rainstorms without manual intervention this autonomous feature was beneficial as the field site was 20 miles away from uw madison campus and thus not accessible for manual operation during rapidly varying soil moisture conditions for the three cropping systems evaluated in this study intra plot replicates two lysimeters were installed in plots 206 sg 402 hp and 411 cc see fig 1 for locations inter plot replication was achieved by installing one lysimeter in an additional cc 212 and sg 412 plot each lysimeter is 25 cm wide by 75 cm long by 15 cm tall 28 1 l capacity and was constructed of 1 6 mm thick stainless steel a 1 mm thick porous stainless steel top with 0 2 μm diameter pores with air entry pressure of 60 kpa mott metallurgical corporation farmington ct allowed water to flow from the soil into the lysimeter lysimeters were installed beneath undisturbed soil profiles by excavating a cavity 0 9 m wide by 0 5 m high by 0 6 m deep into the wall of large soil pits 3 m long by 1 5 m wide and 2 m deep the top surface of the lysimeter was positioned such that it was just above the interface of the clay loam b and sandy c horizons in contact with the soil cavity for this study any water leaving the b horizon was considered representative of water that would eventually reach the water table because of spatial variations in soil horizons determined visually within soil pits the lysimeter depths varied among and within plots from 80 to 195 cm see table s2 while each cropping system can have effective rooting depths deeper than the top of our lysimeter installation in some soils several lines of evidence indicate the vast majority of water and nutrient uptake occurred above these depths 1 the fine to coarse transition from b to c at this site encourages water and nutrient retention in the b horizon which root systems tend to mimic 2 even when rooting depths are greater the fraction of roots in deeper layers is typically quite low following a decreasing exponential profile with depth and 3 the lack of organic c and soil development in the c horizon indicate that prior vegetation had very low root densities below our lysimeter installations two sheets of filter paper 0 5 μm and 1 0 μm pargreen process technologies addison il were placed on top of the porous plate to help maintain moisture near the plate during dry periods and prevent clogging of pores by clay particles the lysimeter was placed on a spring plate and a 0 64 cm thick aluminum plate provided a strong level base on the floor of the cavity for the lysimeter set up two hydraulic jacks and additional scissor jacks were positioned under the spring plate several 8 9 cm by 8 9 cm wooden blocks were placed inside of the spring plate to prevent compression of the springs while the lysimeter was being pushed into the ceiling of the cavity the jacks were raised until there was complete contact between the soil and the lysimeter surface and the collar of the lysimeter pressed 2 3 cm into the cavity ceiling care was taken to not over apply pressure which could damage the equipment several pressure treated wooden blocks were placed between the base plate on the cavity floor and the bottom of the spring plate to support the lysimeter and maintain contact with the soil stainless steel 6 3 mm tubing was connected to both the sample and vacuum ports at the lysimeter and extended from the lysimeter to outside the cavity where rubber tubing was attached and extended to the soil surface multiple electric tensiometers model 229 campbell scientific logan ut were installed in the soil profile of each monitored plot a single tensiometer was installed directly above the porous plate of each lysimeter to monitor any lysimeter effect on the soil water tension an additional tensiometer was installed in each plot to set the suction in the system in plots with a single lysimeter the control tensiometer was installed in undisturbed soil at the same depth as the lysimeter 15 20 cm away from the edge of the plate in plots with multiple lysimeters the control tensiometer was installed in undisturbed soil at the average depth of the lysimeters approximately halfway between the units soil water content was measured with water content reflectometers cs616 campbell scientific logan ut with 300 mm long probes that were installed horizontally into the soil profile at 20 and 65 cm depths a site specific calibration curve was developed for the water content sensors by field calibrating in the soil b horizon at several locations on site as described in the manufacturer literature cambpell scientific 2006 a single calibration curve was applied to all of the water content sensors temperature was measured using type t copper constantine thermocouples at 20 cm depth in all plots and with the thermocouple included with each tensiometer installed at the lysimeter depth all wires tubes were bundled inside a horizontal pvc pipe buried approximately 30 cm deep connected to a control box outside the plot the control box consisted of a datalogger 10x 23x or cr1000 campbell scientific logan ut to run the control program and record soil sensors an excitation module to heat the tensiometers pneumatic valves operated by a 12 v relay driver to control pumping and bleeding and a pump to pull air from the lysimeter datalogger programs were executed every 10 min to i measure matric potential moisture content and temperature ii monitor and set appropriate suction in the lysimeter and iii store hourly averages of all data the aetl systems were designed and installed as described in brye et al 1999 and the automated control systems were designed and calibrated as described by masarik et al 2004 2 4 sample collection and analysis leachate samples were collected from each lysimeter reservoir weekly during wet periods generally spring and early summer and bi weekly during dry periods late summer fall and winter to ensure sufficient volumes for nutrient analyses due to differences in installation dates and troubleshooting periods data collection start times for each lysimeter varied table s2 prior to sampling all vacuum hoses were disconnected from the control box to prevent suction applied during sampling from drawing water from the soil profile into the lysimeter samples were collected from the lysimeter using a ½ hp vacuum pump and 0 75 l vacuum trap the initial 750 ml of water flushed the vacuum trap and sample hoses and was discarded up to another 750 ml was then collected split and sub sampled for nutrient analyses a sample volume of 125 ml was acid preserved using 2 ml of 20 mm h2so4 for nitrate plus nitrite no3 no2 reported as no3 n ammonium n nh4 n total n tn and total p tp analyses an additional 120 ml was divided into two 60 ml aliquots one of which was field filtered 0 45 μm whatman puradisc filter ge healthcare piscataway nj for dissolved reactive p drp analysis the second 60 ml sample was analyzed for ph and electrical conductivity ec all remaining water was pumped from the lysimeter and the total volume was recorded during dry periods when less than 750 ml of water was present in the lysimeter no nutrient analyses were conducted as sample contamination was possible due to insufficient flush volume samples were analyzed in the environmental quality laboratory in the department of biological systems engineering uw madison 2 5 data analysis two types of analyses were completed to better understand water and nutrient dynamics below different biofuel crops 1 water and nutrient fluxes for each sampling period were accumulated over the study period to illustrate temporal variations within and among cropping systems and 2 average water and nutrient fluxes were calculated for each treatment over annual and seasonal periods the variance for each period was calculated across all sampling dates during the study one of the two lysimeters in plot 411 failed and was repaired during the study as a result no drainage measurements were obtained from that lysimeter between 18 november 2011 and 27 march 2012 the corresponding replicate was thus excluded from the treatment average and variance calculations during that period all other sensors in the plot functioned for the entire project period start and end dates for each season table s3 were based on climatic conditions air and soil temperatures and sampling dates to maintain similar length seasonal periods annual periods table s3 were selected to fully capture spring snowmelt within a single monitoring period all annual periods begin in may around the time of corn planting and extend for 12 months through the following spring melt in march or april of all years during the study this period was selected to maximize the amount of available data for comparison given that the monitoring period began in april 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 climatic conditions precipitation and air temperature during the study period 1 april 2011 to 30 june 2014 there was 276 9 cm of total precipitation with fig 2 showing annual cumulative precipitation compared to the 30 year annual average 1981 2010 for arlington wi importantly this 3 year period covered seasons with below average 2012 19 6 cm less near normal 2011 8 3 cm less and above average 2013 10 3 cm more precipitation monthly air temperatures were closest within 2 c to average in 2011 fig 3 there was one anomalously warm period january through july 2012 air temperature 3 3 c above average and one cold period december 2013 to april 2014 4 4 c below average therefore this study encompassed a wide range in precipitation and temperature 3 2 subsurface water flux cumulative annual and seasonal in wisconsin december 1st through march 31st generally coincides with average soil freezing and thawing dates subsurface water fluxes occur episodically during the winter following substantial snow melt events more regularly at the onset of spring thaw and continue through the early growing season corn is typically planted the first week of may as et demand increases throughout the growing season subsurface fluxes decrease which is supported by our direct observations substantially more subsurface water flux was measured in sg plots than in cc or hp plots during the study fig 4 over the 1070 day study period beginning 20 july 2011 average cumulative water fluxes were 114 5 69 3 and 55 5 cm for sg cc and hp respectively or 48 4 29 3 and 23 5 of the total precipitation differences in flux among the cropping systems was most pronounced in late winter or early spring the majority of the subsurface water flux in all treatments occurred between spring thaw through the early growing season march through june fig 4 little water flux occurred between the peak of the growing season through harvest typically june through october from july 2011 through december 2012 precipitation was nearly 30 cm below normal with little snowfall during this period very little water flux occurred in hp 4 3 cm while sg flux 39 8 cm exceeded cc flux 24 3 cm by 63 generally almost no subsurface water flux was measured under frozen soil conditions in any treatment two exceptions were observed in the sg treatment snow melt events in february 2012 and january 2013 resulted in an average of 9 3 and 15 4 cm of water flux respectively from the sg treatments fig 4 that was not observed in cc and hp plots despite the close proximity and comparable snow depths similarly an early spring flux event during april 2014 was much more pronounced in sg than in either cc or hp there appears to be little difference in antecedent soil moisture conditions during the winter season according to available soil moisture data from these plots published in parish et al 2019 instead these enhanced fluxes are suspected to be the result of flow through macropores rather than bulk flow through the soil due to the frozen ground conditions macropores allow water to bypass large portions of the soil matrix enabling rapid infiltration even when soil frost is present mohammed et al 2018 and perennial grasslands can have much higher frozen soil infiltrability due to the presence of macropores compared to croplands van der kamp et al 2003 early in the study water flux measured below the hp plot was consistently lower than below the sg and cc plots however in early spring 2013 and 2014 higher precipitation rates combined with greater snowpack water storage in the hp plots during 2013 table s4 resulted in similar fluxes among hp sg and cc plots the hp plots were harvested during december 2013 and allowed to regrow starting the following spring which may explain higher water flux rates in hp during spring 2014 relative to other seasons as the crop re established likely reducing total evapotranspiration water flux from sg plots was substantially greater than from cc and hp during all three annual periods fig 5 differences among the cropping systems were greatest from may 2011 through april 2012 when fluxes from sg cc and hp measured 55 39 and 6 of the total precipitation 77 1 cm respectively the proportion of precipitation draining from sg and cc was similar for the following two periods between may 2012 through april 2013 46 and 29 of precipitation 70 5 cm respectively and between may 2013 through april 2014 46 and 27 of precipitation 85 0 cm respectively despite approximately 20 more precipitation in the latter year water flux in hp plots was more variable within and across the comparison periods likely due to enhanced snow drifting in some years and harvesting of the hp in 2013 relative rankings among the treatments varied considerably by season fig 6 water flux from sg plots was generally greater than both cc and hp plots in winter and spring except in spring 2013 when all treatments were similar and winter 2014 when there was very little flux very little flux occurred below any treatment in the summer or fall seasons when et would be greatest preventing most infiltrated precipitation from reaching the lysimeter below the root zone any subsurface flux that occurred in summer did so early in the season and the only fall season with any measured water flux occurred in 2011 due to relatively high precipitation in fall that year approximately 40 more precipitation than the next wettest fall some of the differences in water flux between cc and sg plots may be due to differences in crop residue management after harvest and before planting far less residue remained on the soil surface in cc plots than in the sg plots reduced surface cover increases the potential for surface crusting in no till annual cropping systems potentially resulting in more runoff and reduced infiltration compared to perennial cropping systems brye et al 2000 blanco canqui and lal 2007 2009 polich 2014 measured runoff from the cc and sg plots used in our study and reported higher runoff generation from cc compared to sg with greater differences before planting and early in the growing season soil physical characteristics in the cc plots including compaction lower bulk density and less macropores may have also decreased the flux from cc relative to sg plots no till production may reduce soil compaction and promote infiltration and subsurface drainage however additional field operations associated with stover collection for biofuel production may reduce these benefits wilhelm et al 2004 densely rooted warm season grasses such as switchgrass can improve soil structural properties compared to row crops and thereby increase infiltration capacity and hydraulic conductivity blanco canqui 2010 switchgrass has been found to have more prevalent macropores rachman et al 2004 and deeper roots tufekcioglu et al 1998 than corn switchgrass can reduce soil bulk density over time due to increased root biomass near the soil surface relative to annual corn and soybeans frank et al 2004 murphy et al 2004 rachman et al 2004 increasing infiltration capacity schmer et al 2011 showed switchgrass managed for biofuel production in north and south dakota u s significantly decreased soil bulk density up to 0 2 m depth following years of corn or soybean production the changes in soil bulk density occurred mostly in the top 5 cm of soil where the influence of plant biomass inputs management and freeze thaw cycles are greatest small plot 1 m2 runoff from sg plot 412 and cc plot 411 was measured within the same plots in a companion study during 2011 polich 2014 combined runoff for july august and september 2011 was 88 less for sg 0 9 cm compared to cc 7 8 cm indicating greater infiltration capacity for sg compared to cc below the first few cm of soil the role of macropores may be particularly important for sg as discussed above particularly during otherwise frozen ground periods overall there was less water flux below hp plots than beneath cc and sg plots the uncharacteristically high spring flux in hp plots during 2013 which was similar to both cc and sg appears to have been driven more by snow drift accumulation and melt compared to the other treatments snow water equivalent over the lysimeters was measured several times during 2012 and 2013 table s4 substantial snow drifting occurred during january march 2013 with the greatest depths in the hp plot followed by sg with very little drifting in the cc plots this results from standing trees relative to very little vegetative coverage in the other plots snow water equivalent depths varied by 4 cm between cc and sg plots on all measurement dates largest differences january through march 2013 while snow water equivalent depth in the hp plot was as much as 20 cm greater e g march 2013 than in either the cc or sg plots flux from the hp plot in 2013 was much higher compared to the 2012 melt period when no drifting was observed snow depth was not measured in 2014 however minimal differences in drifting were observed among the plots because the hp plots were harvested during december 2013 a wet spring combined with the hp re establishment likely contributed to higher flux in the hp plot in 2014 compared to spring 2012 snowmelt runoff was not quantified during the study due to logistical issues differences in runoff among the plots were assumed to be minimal as there is very little slope within the monitored plots 2 and in 2013 and 2014 ground cover among plots was most similar after hp harvest 3 3 nutrient fluxes nitrogen typically 99 of the total n loads from all treatments was in the form of nitrate nitrite n no2 n concentrations were below 0 25 mg l in all analyzed samples ammonium n nh4 n concentrations also were extremely low throughout the study over 80 of the samples analyzed had concentrations below the analytical detection limit 0 02 mg l therefore only nitrate n no3 n transport is discussed nitrate concentrations fig 7 table s5 were considerably higher in cc plots than sg plots during the study period no3 n concentrations were below the detection limit 0 25 mg no3 n l in the hp plot for most of the study period during the study period the total flux measured in the three cc plots was 640 5 517 8 and 403 2 kg no3 n ha 10 20 times more than measured from the three sg plots 56 5 34 5 and 21 2 kg no3 n ha and approximately 500 times greater than the total fluxes measured from hp 1 4 and 0 4 kg no3 n ha the majority of the no3 n flux occurred during winter and spring months in all cropping systems especially in the cc plots fig 7 during a single three month period march may 2012 the no3 n flux measured from cc plots 411n and 411s totaled 267 9 and 173 6 kg no3 n ha respectively both totals are greater than the total measured flux from any non cc plot during the entire three year study period the differences in no3 n flux measured among cropping systems were primarily driven by differences in concentrations fig 7 rather than total water flux fig 4 though there was some variability across the cc plots concentrations were consistently 5 10 times greater in cc than sg with that difference decreasing over time concentration differences were affected by the three different n fertilizer management regimes among the treatments 1 hp plots received no n fertilizer applications 2 sg plots were fertilized at the same rate 56 kg n ha every growing season and 3 cc plots were fertilized with n at rates recommended by uw extension literature based on pre planting soil test results 21 72 kg n ha during the study differences in no3 n leachate concentrations were large relative to the differences in nominal n application the high no3 n fluxes for cc plots early in this study are at least partly due to legacy effects of historic manure applications to this particular field prior to establishment of the glbrc plots the fields received intensive application of liquid hog manure for several years glbrc personnel indicated that application amounts were different across the field blocks 1 3 plots 206 and 212 received individual applications on the order of 2000 gallons compared to 18 000 45 000 gallons in blocks 4 5 plots 402 411 and 412 however the complete details of the manure applications are not known personal communication with glbrc personnel two of three cc lysimeters plot 411n and 411s and one of three sg lysimeters 412 were located in the area of heavy manure application during the second monitored growing season no3 n concentrations measured from the two cc lysimeters in plot 411 were frequently 2 3 times higher than those measured in plot 212 fig 7 differences among the cc replicates were less pronounced throughout the rest of the study intra treatment variations in no3 n concentrations were not as apparent in sg and hp this may explain some of the differences observed between the concentrations of no3 n among cc plots 411n 411s and 212 during the study warm conditions in early 2012 may have been more favorable for n mineralization leading to greater n release in plot 411 than 212 as more legacy n was available additionally spring pre planting soil test data from 2010 through 2012 in plot 411 table s6 provided by glbrc in conjunction with the fertilizer application data table s1 supports the notion that n was likely over applied in plot 411 in 2011 in 2011 n application rates in plot 411 73 kg n ha were higher than any other year in the study despite the plot having the highest measured pre planting soil no3 n concentration 19 mg kg soil that year no3 n concentrations decreased from late 2011 through spring 2013 as n application rates were lower after 2011 the other dissolved constituents measured but not reported here do not exhibit the same high initial and declining pattern of concentrations over time in 2011 and 2012 the no3 n concentrations in plot 411 exceeded 100 mg l similar to levels found by gehl et al 2005 in irrigated corn plots on sandy soils fertilized at 285 kg n ha or greater after spring 2012 no3 n concentrations from cc plots were within the ranges measured by owens 1990 and andraski et al 2000 which had similar fertilizer strategies and soils to this study the relative ranking of the soluble subsurface n losses from cc and sg and the finding that differences in n losses between cc and sg were greater than the difference in n applied to cc and sg agree with the model results of leduc et al 2016 the authors reported annual nitrate leachate losses of 13 5 kg n ha from no till corn with residue removed compared to 0 2 kg n ha for switchgrass using the environmental policy integrated climate model for converted crp land in iowa in that study simulated n fertilizer application rates for corn and switchgrass were 140 kg n ha and 60 kg n ha respectively while the leachate losses reported by leduc et al 2016 are lower than those measured in this study there are some important differences between the two studies a the crp lands would not have a similar legacy of manure application like we had for our study sites b the aforementioned crp lands covered a wider range of slopes that are much steeper than the relatively flat fields in our work so they observed considerable surface n losses in runoff 44 7 kg n ha from no till corn with residue removed and 13 kg n ha for switchgrass phosphorus sub surface transport of p in all three cropping systems was dominated by the dissolved p form all samples had tp concentrations below the detection limit of 0 5 mg p l since the leachate passes through 1 0 and 0 5 μm filter papers prior to entering the lysimeter virtually no particulates were expected to be present in the leachate annual drp flux from the sg plots was greater than that from cc plots in two of the three years studied 2011 2012 and 2013 2014 vs 2012 2013 while fluxes from sg and cc plots were higher than from the hp plot during all three years fig 5 seasonal drp fluxes in all cropping systems during the study were below 0 30 kg ha with differences among cropping systems dependent on season as was the case with no3 n the majority of the total drp flux in each plot tended to occur over a brief period of time fig 8 nearly 33 of the total drp flux in sg plots 206n and 206s occurred during a single sampling interval in february 2012 unlike no3 n flux the differences in drp flux between cc and sg were driven primarily by the total water flux and not the drp concentration this pattern was particularly evident during snowmelt events in spring 2011 and winter spring 2012 drp concentrations in sg 0 06 0 11 mg l were 2 to 3 times greater than in cc 0 02 0 06 mg l however the drp flux in sg 0 62 1 17 kg ha was up to 6 times that of cc 0 21 0 88 kg ha during these periods there was considerably more water flux through the soil profile in sg plots than cc brye et al 2002 hypothesized that much of dissolved p moving through the soil profile did so via macropore flow rather than through the bulk soil matrix thus an increase in water flux from a treatment is likely to increase potential for p transport through the soil profile this agrees well with the observations of the current study with higher drp concentrations measured in leachate from sg treatments in spring and winter months when sg plots had the highest water flux rate particularly in relatively large pulses during february 2012 macropore flow may also help explain why despite higher soil test p levels in cc plots higher p fluxes were measured in the sg treatments the average drp concentrations observed in this study were similar to total dissolved p tdp concentrations in leachate reported by brye et al 2002 in prairie and various corn treatments at arlington wi brye et al 2002 reported average tdp concentrations january to september from no till corn and chisel plowed corn of 0 056 mg l and 0 036 mg l respectively and from corn fertilized with n 180 kg n ha and unfertilized corn of 0 079 mg l and 0 014 mg l respectively soil test data 2008 2011 obtained from glbrc personnel show bray 1 p levels in the top 10 cm of approximately 120 ppm in the hp plot 160 240 ppm in sg plots and 210 270 ppm in cc plots brye et al 2002 report bray 1 soil p top 10 cm of 100 ppm or less in all treatments due to the immobile nature of p in the soil profile it is reasonable to assume that only minor differences in dissolved p would be present deeper in the profile despite the differences in soil test p between the studies soil test data indicate very little change in soil p concentrations in hp sg and cc plots over the first several years after biofuel crop establishment due to a long history of manure application at aars site of this study differences in drp leaching resulting from current biofuel p management are not likely to be observed for several more years 4 conclusions more water flux was measured from sg than any other treatment over the study period cumulative subsurface water flux as a percent of the total precipitation below sg was nearly twice that measured below cc and hp the majority of water flux from all cropping systems occurred during late winter and early spring when soils had higher soil moisture levels water movement through the soil profile in sg was characterized by intense late winter and early spring flux events likely dominated by macroporous flow very little water flux was measured from hp prior to the first harvest during the first year of regrowth water fluxes were generally similar to the other cropping systems nitrate no3 n fluxes from cc were very high relative to sg and hp concentrations of no3 n were up to 10 times higher below cc than sg despite n application rates that were similar between the two cropping systems intense manure application prior to our study period may be responsible for very high initial no3 n flux from cc plots the difference between measured no3 n concentrations in cc and sg decreased by the conclusion of the study however the sg treatments still had much lower no3 n flux than cc no3 n flux from hp was very low with concentrations undetectable for the majority of the study no n was applied to the crop overall results indicate that cc in this environment appears to be much more susceptible to nitrate leaching than the perennial crops studied phosphorus losses were very low from all three cropping systems the measured flux was driven primarily by differences in total water flux among the cropping systems and not differences in leachate p concentrations due to the relatively immobile nature of p and low p fertilizer application rates during the study there was no apparent correlation between the cropping system and p concentrations in subsurface water higher up to 6 times drp fluxes were measured in the sg treatments compared to the cc treatments this greater p transport is likely because of greater macroporous flow in sg results from this study indicate that subsurface water and nutrient losses to the environment vary seasonally and among nutrients and are dependent on crop and management for the cropping systems evaluated no3 n fluxes were driven by concentration differences and not influenced by nominal differences in n fertilizer inputs whereas drp fluxes were mainly driven by water fluxes and therefore independent of p inputs and soil test p monitoring efforts serendipitously captured the legacy of excessive fertilization from prior manure applications which is likely to be a common scenario for agricultural fields used for biofuel production

10987,irrigation with secondary treated wastewater stw as a support to traditional irrigation management is becoming a necessary alternative to addressing issues of water shortage and fertilizer saving the application of stw on young potted plants of prunus persica l cv big top grafted on gf 677 was studied outdoors on two consecutive seasons during which three different irrigation treatments were compared 1 irrigation with stw 2 irrigation with tap water with the addition of mineral fertilizer tw mf and 3 irrigation with tap water tw to assess the effects of the different irrigation treatments tree nutritional status shoot growth stem cross sectional area scsa trunk cross sectional area tcsa leaf gas exchanges plant water status fruit growth fruit yield and quality were monitored during both seasons tree nutritional status vegetative growth tcsa cumulative plant photosynthesis fruit growth and yield were positively influenced by stw irrigation compared to tw tw mf trees showed the highest vegetative growth and vegetative reproductive ratio this induced a rise in their water use and a consequent decrease in stem water potential indicating the onset of water stress conditions results indicated that there was no negative effect of stw application on any of the monitored parameters stw partially improved the plant physiological nutritional and productive performances due to its intrinsic fertilizing effect these results encourage further studies on the possibilities to directly use stw as an alternative source for irrigating and fertigating fruit crops even in open field conditions keywords water reuse water scarcity fertilizer saving tree nutritional status plant water status leaf gas exchanges 1 introduction agriculture is the mostly threatened sector by the effects of climate change due to the rise of temperature and the decrease in precipitation frequency occurring especially during the summer period when evapotranspiration requirements are higher and water is needed for irrigation for this reason the use of treated wastewater as an alternative source for irrigation represents a viable strategy to avoid water scarcity during the warmest periods of the season as a support to traditional irrigation management not only in arid and semi arid environments but also in areas affected by occasional water shortages beside its irrigation value treated wastewater could have a positive effect on soil and plant nutrition improving soil fertility soil structure water holding capacity carbon storage and reducing the need for mineral fertilization due to its intrinsic richness in organic matter and mineral elements such as n p and k khurana and singh 2012 on the other hand treated wastewater may imply environmental risks both in terms of soil pollution heavy metals contamination safety of harvested crops presence of potential bacterial human pathogens and social acceptance muchuweti et al 2006 bernstein 2011 fatta kassinos et al 2010 in addition the reiterate use of salt rich treated wastewater may increase the risk of salinization in particular due to na and cl accumulation which can compromise the growth and yield of cultivated plants ben mahmoud et al 2006 lü et al 2012 hapeshi et al 2014 dridi et al 2017 normally wastewater is subjected to several cleaning processes before its reuse but it still maintains a certain level of toxic elements and microorganisms with potential negative effects on soil quality crop and human safety christou et al 2014 despite that the use of treated wastewater in fruit crops has already been successfully applied on species cultivated in drought environments like olea europaea petousi et al 2015 mandarin trees citrus clementina pedrero et al 2013a b lemon trees citrus limon pedrero and alarcon 2009 nectarines prunus persica vivaldi et al 2013 grapevines vitis vinifera mendoza espinosa et al 2008 most of the studies regarding water reuse for irrigation investigate the use of tertiary treated wastewater ttw currently the maximum level of cleaning treatment used for wastewater recovery and are mainly focused on pollutants contamination aspects mainly investigating soil chemical and microbiological proprieties leaf mineral status productivity christou et al 2014 pedrero et al 2015 nicolás et al 2016 2017 fruit quality and fruit safety pedrero et al 2012 2018 the main conclusions from these studies are that tertiary treated wastewater ttw can be used as an additional water resource for tree irrigation in water scarce mediterranean environments from the legislative point of view the european union still misses a general agreement about the maximal pollution thresholds allowed for the use of treated wastewater in agriculture and different regulations are applied in each country in italy for example very low pollution thresholds are allowed for the use of treated wastewater in agriculture italian legislative decree no 185 03 and no discrimination in the pollutant thresholds is foreseen for the different cultivated crops bio by deloitte 2015 for this reason it is necessary to investigate on the consequences deriving also from the use of stw which is still not allowed in italy for irrigation purposes stw is currently the treated wastewater resource which is mostly available in italy https www istat it and is already characterized by good intrinsic parameters for irrigation purposes thus potentially representing a water resource with a high benefit cost ratio the stw water resource could then be applicable for the irrigation of crops whose edible part is not wet by irrigation to avoid any microbiological contamination of the final product in addition the potential nutritional effect of stw is still underestimated as it could lead to significant fertilizer savings due to its high level of macronutrients chen et al 2008 and micronutrients stw application might ensure the transfer of fertilizing elements such as nitrogen n phosphorous p potassium k organic matter as well as micro nutrients into agricultural soils wced 1987 this fertilizing potential is partially lowered for ttw where the levels of nutrients especially nitrogen and phosphorous are significantly reduced by the cleaning treatment pescod 1992 further studies are needed to optimize the levels of water filtration on stw in order to maintain the potential nutritional value of treated wastewater while guaranteeing the chemical and microbiological safety of the harvested products the majority of the studies on treated wastewater irrigation have focused mainly on reclaimed urban effluents especially ttw however research on the physiological performance of tree crops irrigated with stw is still lacking as studies have been conducted just on ttw and only on some species like mandarin pedrero et al 2014 nicolás et al 2016 2017 and grapefruit pedrero et al 2013a b romero trigueros et al 2014 paudel et al 2018 the aim of this work is to investigate the potential physiological and nutritional effects of using stw treated according to the italian legislative decree no 152 06 as an alternative irrigation source on young nectarine trees which is one of the main cultivated fruit species worldwide the use of stw could thus represent an opportunity to mitigate water shortage in summer time and a rational approach for reducing fertilizer use which would otherwise be wasted in the environment preventing potential contamination of both surface and groundwater asano 1998 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental set up the trial was carried out

table 1 the values of these parameters were significantly higher in the stw than in the tw table 1 the average no3 n p and k concentrations detected in stw were almost 4 100 and 5 times higher than the average concentrations measured in tw respectively the electrical conductivity over the experimental period was 1 21 in stw and 0 47 ds m 1 in tw the sar index was 1 85 in stw and 0 63 in tw e coli average concentration in stw was equal to 4 cfu 100 ml 1 no salmonella was detected in any of the stw samples 3 2 tree nutritional status treatments significantly affected tree nutritional status with stronger effects on leaves than on fruit tissues table 2 n concentration in tw leaves was below the optimal threshold toselli et al 2006 table 2 while the overall mineral concentration in tw mf and stw leaves were in the optimal range for this nectarine variety sorrenti et al 2016 moreover despite the larger canopy size and the higher amount of fruit tissue peel and pulp n concentration was statistically increased by the supply of mineral n from tw mf with intermediate values recorded in the leaves and fruit peel of trees irrigated with stw table 2 among micronutrients mineral fertilization slightly reduced leaf b concentration and increased that of cu while regardless of the treatment no effects emerged on leaf fe mn na and zn concentrations table 2 the same trend was observed in the fruit peel and fruit pulp for b concentration table 2 notably heavy metal concentration in leaves and fruit tissues was statistically comparable among treatments except for zn which was higher only in the fruit peel of stw trees 3 3 vegetative growth in 2016 shoot length fig 1 a showed an initial fast increase especially for tw mf and stw treatments reaching a steady state at about 100 dafb tw mf trees reached their maximum shoot length very early in the season at 97 dafb with an average value of 54 8 cm stw shoots were characterized by a similar growth pattern with a more gradual increase and reached a plateau 25 days later at 122 dafb with an average shoot length of 42 0 cm instead shoots on tw trees were always shorter than on tw mf and stw trees showing a limited and slow growth during the whole season and reaching a maximum length of 18 8 cm a similar pattern was recorded in 2017 fig 1b but in this case almost no differences were detected between tw and stw trees in 2017 a delay in reaching the maximum shoot length values compared to 2016 was also recorded for all treatments 19 8 cm at 110 dafb for tw mf 14 4 cm and 8 5 cm at 145 dafb for stw and tw treatments respectively in 2016 the seasonal scsa growth pattern fig 1c showed an almost constant increase for tw mf and stw trees reaching values of 44 47 and 33 48 mm2 respectively at 191 dafb tw trees showed a completely different pattern as their scsa increased very slowly during the season with a final value of 13 38 mm2 tw mf and stw trees scsas were statistically higher than tw during almost all the season in 2017 scsa seasonal pattern fig 1d showed a linear increase followed by an exponential trend in the final part of the season for all treatments higher scsas were recorded in tw mf trees compared to stw trees from 85 to 145 dfab but no differences were recorded at 174 dafb with values of 16 31 11 95 and 12 55 mm2 for tw mf stw and tw trees respectively tcsa measurements performed at 70 dafb 2016 at 50 dfab 2017 and at 170 dafb 2017 showed how tw mf trees maintained larger trunks while stw trees maintained intermediate values during the whole trial although at the beginning no statistical difference was detected among treatments tcsa average values at the end of the experiment were indeed 255 490 and 360 mm2 for tw tw mf and stw trees respectively fig 2 3 4 water relations in 2016 leaf and stem water potentials showed the same decreasing pattern from early morning to midday on all dates of measurements instead from midday to afternoon they followed an opposite trend with values becoming more positive for the leaves and more negative for the stem fig 3 this trend was similar on all dates of measurement except for the stem at 127 and 161 dafb where stw trees started to recover in the afternoon and for the leaves at 72 and 161 dafb when a higher water potential with a faster recover in the afternoon was shown for the control treatment few differences were detected among treatments especially in the morning at 106 and 127 dafb when tw mf trees showed lower stem and leaf water potential values especially during the afternoon in 2017 tw and stw were not different in terms of stem water potentials during all the season fig 4 a while at 93 and 132 dafb the tw mf treatment showed more negative values with appreciable statistical differences compared to tw and stw trees instead midday leaf water potential fig 4b showed an increasing trend at the beginning from 93 to 132 dafb followed by a decreasing pattern at the end of the season from 132 to 167 dafb the only significant differences for leaf water potential were detected at 93 dafb between tw and tw mf treatments 3 5 leaf gas exchanges in all 2016 dates of measurements except at 127 dafb leaf photosynthesis showed a morning increase reaching a peak around midday followed by an afternoon decrease a similar pattern was recorded for transpiration in almost all dates of measurement except at 72 dfab fig 5 at 127 dafb leaf photosynthesis showed a decreasing pattern from 9 00 h on with statistical differences between treatments at 09 00 and 12 00 h with higher values recorded for stw trees followed by tw and finally by tw mf on the same date transpiration followed the typical daily pattern with a peak at midday followed by stomata closure in the afternoon for tw and stw treatments tw mf trees showed a different behaviour keeping very low transpiration values lower than 2 mmol h20 m 2s 1 during the whole day at 127 dafb tw trees always maintained higher transpiration values than tw mf at all hours of measurements in 2017 leaf photosynthesis and transpiration showed the same trend for tw and stw treatments fig 6 a b this pattern was characterized by 2 positive peaks at 93 dafb and 167 dafb and a negative peak at 132 dafb the tw mf treatment did not show any positive peak at 93 dafb maintaining low values of photosynthesis and transpiration during the whole season statistical differences appeared at 93 132 and 167 dafb mostly for tw mf trees which maintained lower photosynthesis than tw and stw trees cumulative daily photosynthesis for the whole canopy estimated at the end of the 2017 growing season highlighted differences among treatments fig 7 a indeed tw mf trees reached the highest daily co2 assimilation with 20 68 g d 1 then followed by stw that reached 10 84 g d 1 and eventually by tw trees with 5 37 g d 1 each treatment was significantly different from each other the same pattern was shown by daily transpiration although in this case no statistical differences between tw and stw trees appeared fig 7b 3 6 fruit growth yield and fruit quality the seasonal pattern of fruit diameter showed the same trend for all treatments with reduced growth for tw and tw mf trees at 93 and 100 dafb fig 8 the stw treatment kept highest values in fruit dimeter for almost all the season if compared to the other two statistical differences were recorded at 85 93 100 121 dafb mainly between the tw and stw but no differences were detected at 111 dafb the total fruit yield was more than doubled for the tw mf and stw if compared to the tw the average tree fruit number was indeed 17 2 fruit tree 1 2 9 16 7 fruit tree 1 3 0 and 7 6 fruit tree 1 1 1 for the tw mf stw and tw treatments respectively at the end of the 2017 season tw mf trees exhibited the highest vegetative reproductive ratio 0 11 m2 fruit 1 0 019 compared to the much lower values of stw 0 05 m2 fruit 1 0 007 and tw 0 02 m2 fruit 1 0 002 the fruit quality analysis showed how the irrigation treatments affected in a consistent way almost all traits dry matter firmness and soluble solids content fig 9 tw mf fruit always showed the highest values for these parameters while tw and stw fruit showed similar values for all the others parameters fresh weight chroma a chroma b and lightness l no statistical difference among treatments was recorded 4 discussion the chemical features of the stw and tw waters table 1 measured during the experiment revealed several differences in their composition stw was characterized by a higher concentration for almost all fertility elements like n p k ca mg and organic matter this natural richness in mineral elements represents an important and free source of nutrients for improving soil fertility plant growth crop yield and preventing lack of macro and micro nutrients the availability of these elements could allow a significant reduction in fertilizer application while still meeting tree nutrient requirements as it has been reported from other studies on fruit trees pedrero et al 2012 vivaldi et al 2017 in our experimental conditions the supply of stw as irrigation source allowed to save 28 3 49 0 and 77 7 of n p and k respectively compared to tw mf in any case the potential nutrient supply is highly heterogeneous among treated wastewater sources depending mostly on the quality of the water raw arriving to the treatment plant and to the reclaiming process levy et al 2011 for these reasons fertilizer savings can highly differ among treated wastewater sources even if stw showed higher ph sar ec heavy metal e g zn fe and cu contents and e coli load than tw table 1 it did not exceed the italian thresholds for reclaimed water for agricultural purpose ministerial decree no 185 2003 these data highlight how this stw could be safely used also on crops that are considered salt stress sensible such as nectarine without showing any phytotoxic effect or salt stress sensibility ayers and westcot 1985 maas and grattan 1999 the low salinity effects recorded in our trial could be due both to the low ec values of stw compared to other treated wastewater sources qian and mecha 2005 and to the soil properties e g soil texture ph caco3 content that probably reduced the possible soil salinization and heavy metal soil accumulation however as our trial was carried out for only two years we cannot exclude the possibility of long term accumulation of salt in the soil when treated wastewater is applied for several years in open field conditions dridi et al 2017 treated wastewater could indeed affect negatively soil physical properties i e saturated hydraulic conductivity ks sepaskhah and sokoot 2010 due to its richness in suspended solids on the other hand as reported by sepaskhah and karizi 2011 the alternate use of treated wastewater and fresh water can mitigate the negative effects on the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity treated wastewater should then be seen as an essential support to the traditional freshwater sources especially during water shortages periods concerning tree nutritional status stw could not reach the tw mf level even though it provided a higher amount of macro and micro nutrients either in inorganic or organic forms compared to tw table 2 this is confirming that nectarine is a high demanding species for n and that n delivered exclusively by stw was not enough to satisfy tree requirements on the contrary leaf p ca mg and b concentrations significantly decreased in tw mf trees this was likely due to the dilution and partitioning effect induced by a larger vegetative biomass this is in line with the highest leaf p k ca mg and b concentration recorded in tw trees table 2 which seems related to their reduced canopy growth and lower crop load these data indicate how stw irrigation may contribute to a partial fulfilment of plant nutrient requirements however beside representing a water source the amount of nutrients supplied by stw could be substantial and must be taken into consideration in the fertilization schedule in particular in case of open field applications of treated wastewater tree fertilization needs should be re assessed taking into account the different canopy development and the higher fruit yields compared to potted trees thus modifying the fertigation like effect provided by treated wastewater the fruit heavy metal concentrations were within the thresholds set for heavy metal by the fao regulation for contaminants and toxins in food and feed fao who codex alimentarius 2003 even for zn which was the most present heavy metal this result is particularly important for peach fruit which is known to maintain a functional xylem until harvest morandi et al 2007 and it represents a further confirmation towards the potential use of stw for fruit crops irrigation this outcome would be probably reduced in open field conditions where the more developed root system might not be fully in contact with the soil solution i e treated wastewater as it happens in potted trees on the other hand the volume of soil wetted by treated wastewater would be increased if compared to a reference pot e g 40 l thus limiting the soil heavy metal retention capacity mapanda et al 2005 the application of treated wastewater to nectarine trees positively affected vegetative growth during the season in terms of both shoot length and scsa in particular shoot growth data recorded in 2016 fig 1a c were not reduced in trees irrigated with stw compared to tw mf trees thus highlighting the positive nutritional effect of this alternative source for irrigation stw irrigated plants showed a more balanced shoot growth with a lower source sink ratio compared to tw mf trees likely due to the fertilization contribution provided by stw a similar response for both shoot length and scsa was recorded in 2017 fig 1b d although this season was characterized by a lower vegetative growth compared to the previous year for all treatments being potted plants already at their third leaf the good performances of tw mf and stw trees in terms of vegetative growth were confirmed by tcsa data fig 2 representing a typical and reliable index for estimating tree growth during both years in 2016 predawn stem water potential fig 3 did not show any differences among treatments and no negative effect of stw irrigation was detected in stw trees at any time during the season 161 dafb this result suggests how the possible higher values of salt added to the soil by stw did not cause any osmotic stress even after 4 months of continuous irrigation fig 3 similar results were achieved on mandarin trees irrigated with a tertiary treated wastewater ttw by nicolás et al 2016 however during the day both stem and leaf water potentials occasionally showed more negative values for tw mf and stw treatments starting from 106 dfab this behaviour could be mainly attributed to the higher availability of nutrients in both treatments which might have decreased the osmotic potential of the leaf tissues in 2017 stem water potential at 93 and 132 dafb fig 4 partially confirmed the trend recorded during the last dates of 2016 with tw mf trees showing reduced midday values below 1 5 mpa thus indicating a drought stress condition this effect can be attributed to the higher vegetative growth recorded during this season in tw mf trees which caused a higher water demand despite water availability was guaranteed to all trees during the trial the lower water potentials recorded in tw mf trees might also be caused by the addition of fertilizers few days prior measurements which temporarily increased soil salinity limiting plant water uptake this probably increased the soil osmotic potential with a further negative impact on stem wp that became more negative compared to tw and stw trees the same trend appears also for leaf wp at 93 dafb with tw mf trees exhibiting the lower midday wp in open field conditions and commercial environments this possible salinity effect might be buffered by the wider soil space explored by the roots and by the bigger tree size although further studies are necessary to asses possible salinity effects deriving from long term irrigation with treated wastewater as for leaf gas exchanges no limitation in co2 assimilation and evapotranspiration were recorded during the first half of the season in 2016 fig 5 indicating no phytotoxic effect induced by irrigation with stw indeed above threshold concentrations of b gimeno et al 2012 and na navarro et al 2011 in the soil solution can lead to stomatal closure e g especially in controlled and limited conditions as in pots which in turn may reduce transpiration rate and photosynthesis garcía sánchez and syvertsen 2006 similar and positive results were achieved by nicolás et al 2016 on mandarin trees however as a consequence of their reduced water potentials tw mf trees showed a reduction in both a and e at 127 dafb indicating the presence of some water stress however in 2017 tw mf trees are the ones showing the best performance in terms of total amount of co2 assimilated fig 7 although this result is mainly related to their highest leaf canopy area it is interesting to notice how stw trees still maintain a higher assimilation capacity compared to tw due to the beneficial nutritional effect of irrigation with stw with no negative effect in vegetative growth and water potentials as a result of this optimal balance between vegetative and reproductive sinks stw trees showed the highest fruit growth rates during the season fig 8 and final yield comparable to tw mf trees this is particularly interesting from the commercial point of view size is currently the only quality trait that is paid to the grower especially if this effect is maintained also on trees cultivated in open filed condition as reported by pedrero et al 2012 pedrero et al 2014 and nicolás et al 2016 for mandarin and grapefruit trees besides stw fruit maintained similar quality levels in terms of dry matter percentage firmness and colour than what recorded for tw fruit but increased their soluble solids content indicating an overall positive effect of stw irrigation on nectarine fruit quality ahmed et al 2009 on the contrary tw mf trees showed reduced fruit growth rates during the season this must be attributed to the higher competition with the vegetative growth as a consequence of the higher vegetative reproductive ratio compared to stw and tw trees a further reason for limiting fruit growth in tw mf trees is represented by their midday stem water potential that were below the thresholds of water stress naor 1999 despite the lower fruit size the presence of stress in tw mf trees positively affected other fruit quality traits such as dry matter percentage and soluble solids content this effect must be attributed to the lower stem water potential which might have reduced xylem flows to the fruit morandi et al 2007 thus increasing the relative contribution of the phloem to nectarine fruit growth 5 conclusions this study considers for the first time the physiological nutritional and productive effects of using stw as an alternative source of irrigation in fruit crops results show how stw irrigation in controlled conditions for two subsequent seasons did not induce any negative effect on plant leaf water status and gas exchanges thus suggesting the lack of phytotoxic effects and heavy metal accumulation neither in the vegetative leaves nor in the reproductive fruit tissues on the contrary it induced a positive effect on total canopy assimilation and improved tree source sink ratio with positive effects on fruit growth fruit yield and quality due to the beneficial nutritional effect of stw at total canopy level indeed stw could partially contribute to fulfil plant nutrient requirements even though fertilization must necessarily be integrated by alternative sources e g mineral or organic fertilizers these positive results suggest how stw could be used as a potential alternative source for irrigation of fruit trees in presence of water scarcity and how it may represent a free source of nutrients reducing the need of mineral fertilizers and being at the same time beneficial also for the environment limiting eutrophication problems the use of stw as an alternative source for irrigation is particularly suitable for orchards irrigated with typical drip irrigation systems as fruit are not wet by irrigation thus decreasing the risk for external contaminations however further studies are necessary to investigate on the potential translocation of pollutants e g human pathogenic bacteria to the edible tissues in order to guarantee the safety of the fruit harvested moreover interdisciplinary feasibility studies should be conducted in open field orchards for a longer period in order to avoid possible limitations typical of potted trees and evaluate possible long term effects deriving from the continuous irrigation with treated wastewater 
10987,irrigation with secondary treated wastewater stw as a support to traditional irrigation management is becoming a necessary alternative to addressing issues of water shortage and fertilizer saving the application of stw on young potted plants of prunus persica l cv big top grafted on gf 677 was studied outdoors on two consecutive seasons during which three different irrigation treatments were compared 1 irrigation with stw 2 irrigation with tap water with the addition of mineral fertilizer tw mf and 3 irrigation with tap water tw to assess the effects of the different irrigation treatments tree nutritional status shoot growth stem cross sectional area scsa trunk cross sectional area tcsa leaf gas exchanges plant water status fruit growth fruit yield and quality were monitored during both seasons tree nutritional status vegetative growth tcsa cumulative plant photosynthesis fruit growth and yield were positively influenced by stw irrigation compared to tw tw mf trees showed the highest vegetative growth and vegetative reproductive ratio this induced a rise in their water use and a consequent decrease in stem water potential indicating the onset of water stress conditions results indicated that there was no negative effect of stw application on any of the monitored parameters stw partially improved the plant physiological nutritional and productive performances due to its intrinsic fertilizing effect these results encourage further studies on the possibilities to directly use stw as an alternative source for irrigating and fertigating fruit crops even in open field conditions keywords water reuse water scarcity fertilizer saving tree nutritional status plant water status leaf gas exchanges 1 introduction agriculture is the mostly threatened sector by the effects of climate change due to the rise of temperature and the decrease in precipitation frequency occurring especially during the summer period when evapotranspiration requirements are higher and water is needed for irrigation for this reason the use of treated wastewater as an alternative source for irrigation represents a viable strategy to avoid water scarcity during the warmest periods of the season as a support to traditional irrigation management not only in arid and semi arid environments but also in areas affected by occasional water shortages beside its irrigation value treated wastewater could have a positive effect on soil and plant nutrition improving soil fertility soil structure water holding capacity carbon storage and reducing the need for mineral fertilization due to its intrinsic richness in organic matter and mineral elements such as n p and k khurana and singh 2012 on the other hand treated wastewater may imply environmental risks both in terms of soil pollution heavy metals contamination safety of harvested crops presence of potential bacterial human pathogens and social acceptance muchuweti et al 2006 bernstein 2011 fatta kassinos et al 2010 in addition the reiterate use of salt rich treated wastewater may increase the risk of salinization in particular due to na and cl accumulation which can compromise the growth and yield of cultivated plants ben mahmoud et al 2006 lü et al 2012 hapeshi et al 2014 dridi et al 2017 normally wastewater is subjected to several cleaning processes before its reuse but it still maintains a certain level of toxic elements and microorganisms with potential negative effects on soil quality crop and human safety christou et al 2014 despite that the use of treated wastewater in fruit crops has already been successfully applied on species cultivated in drought environments like olea europaea petousi et al 2015 mandarin trees citrus clementina pedrero et al 2013a b lemon trees citrus limon pedrero and alarcon 2009 nectarines prunus persica vivaldi et al 2013 grapevines vitis vinifera mendoza espinosa et al 2008 most of the studies regarding water reuse for irrigation investigate the use of tertiary treated wastewater ttw currently the maximum level of cleaning treatment used for wastewater recovery and are mainly focused on pollutants contamination aspects mainly investigating soil chemical and microbiological proprieties leaf mineral status productivity christou et al 2014 pedrero et al 2015 nicolás et al 2016 2017 fruit quality and fruit safety pedrero et al 2012 2018 the main conclusions from these studies are that tertiary treated wastewater ttw can be used as an additional water resource for tree irrigation in water scarce mediterranean environments from the legislative point of view the european union still misses a general agreement about the maximal pollution thresholds allowed for the use of treated wastewater in agriculture and different regulations are applied in each country in italy for example very low pollution thresholds are allowed for the use of treated wastewater in agriculture italian legislative decree no 185 03 and no discrimination in the pollutant thresholds is foreseen for the different cultivated crops bio by deloitte 2015 for this reason it is necessary to investigate on the consequences deriving also from the use of stw which is still not allowed in italy for irrigation purposes stw is currently the treated wastewater resource which is mostly available in italy https www istat it and is already characterized by good intrinsic parameters for irrigation purposes thus potentially representing a water resource with a high benefit cost ratio the stw water resource could then be applicable for the irrigation of crops whose edible part is not wet by irrigation to avoid any microbiological contamination of the final product in addition the potential nutritional effect of stw is still underestimated as it could lead to significant fertilizer savings due to its high level of macronutrients chen et al 2008 and micronutrients stw application might ensure the transfer of fertilizing elements such as nitrogen n phosphorous p potassium k organic matter as well as micro nutrients into agricultural soils wced 1987 this fertilizing potential is partially lowered for ttw where the levels of nutrients especially nitrogen and phosphorous are significantly reduced by the cleaning treatment pescod 1992 further studies are needed to optimize the levels of water filtration on stw in order to maintain the potential nutritional value of treated wastewater while guaranteeing the chemical and microbiological safety of the harvested products the majority of the studies on treated wastewater irrigation have focused mainly on reclaimed urban effluents especially ttw however research on the physiological performance of tree crops irrigated with stw is still lacking as studies have been conducted just on ttw and only on some species like mandarin pedrero et al 2014 nicolás et al 2016 2017 and grapefruit pedrero et al 2013a b romero trigueros et al 2014 paudel et al 2018 the aim of this work is to investigate the potential physiological and nutritional effects of using stw treated according to the italian legislative decree no 152 06 as an alternative irrigation source on young nectarine trees which is one of the main cultivated fruit species worldwide the use of stw could thus represent an opportunity to mitigate water shortage in summer time and a rational approach for reducing fertilizer use which would otherwise be wasted in the environment preventing potential contamination of both surface and groundwater asano 1998 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental set up the trial was carried out

table 1 the values of these parameters were significantly higher in the stw than in the tw table 1 the average no3 n p and k concentrations detected in stw were almost 4 100 and 5 times higher than the average concentrations measured in tw respectively the electrical conductivity over the experimental period was 1 21 in stw and 0 47 ds m 1 in tw the sar index was 1 85 in stw and 0 63 in tw e coli average concentration in stw was equal to 4 cfu 100 ml 1 no salmonella was detected in any of the stw samples 3 2 tree nutritional status treatments significantly affected tree nutritional status with stronger effects on leaves than on fruit tissues table 2 n concentration in tw leaves was below the optimal threshold toselli et al 2006 table 2 while the overall mineral concentration in tw mf and stw leaves were in the optimal range for this nectarine variety sorrenti et al 2016 moreover despite the larger canopy size and the higher amount of fruit tissue peel and pulp n concentration was statistically increased by the supply of mineral n from tw mf with intermediate values recorded in the leaves and fruit peel of trees irrigated with stw table 2 among micronutrients mineral fertilization slightly reduced leaf b concentration and increased that of cu while regardless of the treatment no effects emerged on leaf fe mn na and zn concentrations table 2 the same trend was observed in the fruit peel and fruit pulp for b concentration table 2 notably heavy metal concentration in leaves and fruit tissues was statistically comparable among treatments except for zn which was higher only in the fruit peel of stw trees 3 3 vegetative growth in 2016 shoot length fig 1 a showed an initial fast increase especially for tw mf and stw treatments reaching a steady state at about 100 dafb tw mf trees reached their maximum shoot length very early in the season at 97 dafb with an average value of 54 8 cm stw shoots were characterized by a similar growth pattern with a more gradual increase and reached a plateau 25 days later at 122 dafb with an average shoot length of 42 0 cm instead shoots on tw trees were always shorter than on tw mf and stw trees showing a limited and slow growth during the whole season and reaching a maximum length of 18 8 cm a similar pattern was recorded in 2017 fig 1b but in this case almost no differences were detected between tw and stw trees in 2017 a delay in reaching the maximum shoot length values compared to 2016 was also recorded for all treatments 19 8 cm at 110 dafb for tw mf 14 4 cm and 8 5 cm at 145 dafb for stw and tw treatments respectively in 2016 the seasonal scsa growth pattern fig 1c showed an almost constant increase for tw mf and stw trees reaching values of 44 47 and 33 48 mm2 respectively at 191 dafb tw trees showed a completely different pattern as their scsa increased very slowly during the season with a final value of 13 38 mm2 tw mf and stw trees scsas were statistically higher than tw during almost all the season in 2017 scsa seasonal pattern fig 1d showed a linear increase followed by an exponential trend in the final part of the season for all treatments higher scsas were recorded in tw mf trees compared to stw trees from 85 to 145 dfab but no differences were recorded at 174 dafb with values of 16 31 11 95 and 12 55 mm2 for tw mf stw and tw trees respectively tcsa measurements performed at 70 dafb 2016 at 50 dfab 2017 and at 170 dafb 2017 showed how tw mf trees maintained larger trunks while stw trees maintained intermediate values during the whole trial although at the beginning no statistical difference was detected among treatments tcsa average values at the end of the experiment were indeed 255 490 and 360 mm2 for tw tw mf and stw trees respectively fig 2 3 4 water relations in 2016 leaf and stem water potentials showed the same decreasing pattern from early morning to midday on all dates of measurements instead from midday to afternoon they followed an opposite trend with values becoming more positive for the leaves and more negative for the stem fig 3 this trend was similar on all dates of measurement except for the stem at 127 and 161 dafb where stw trees started to recover in the afternoon and for the leaves at 72 and 161 dafb when a higher water potential with a faster recover in the afternoon was shown for the control treatment few differences were detected among treatments especially in the morning at 106 and 127 dafb when tw mf trees showed lower stem and leaf water potential values especially during the afternoon in 2017 tw and stw were not different in terms of stem water potentials during all the season fig 4 a while at 93 and 132 dafb the tw mf treatment showed more negative values with appreciable statistical differences compared to tw and stw trees instead midday leaf water potential fig 4b showed an increasing trend at the beginning from 93 to 132 dafb followed by a decreasing pattern at the end of the season from 132 to 167 dafb the only significant differences for leaf water potential were detected at 93 dafb between tw and tw mf treatments 3 5 leaf gas exchanges in all 2016 dates of measurements except at 127 dafb leaf photosynthesis showed a morning increase reaching a peak around midday followed by an afternoon decrease a similar pattern was recorded for transpiration in almost all dates of measurement except at 72 dfab fig 5 at 127 dafb leaf photosynthesis showed a decreasing pattern from 9 00 h on with statistical differences between treatments at 09 00 and 12 00 h with higher values recorded for stw trees followed by tw and finally by tw mf on the same date transpiration followed the typical daily pattern with a peak at midday followed by stomata closure in the afternoon for tw and stw treatments tw mf trees showed a different behaviour keeping very low transpiration values lower than 2 mmol h20 m 2s 1 during the whole day at 127 dafb tw trees always maintained higher transpiration values than tw mf at all hours of measurements in 2017 leaf photosynthesis and transpiration showed the same trend for tw and stw treatments fig 6 a b this pattern was characterized by 2 positive peaks at 93 dafb and 167 dafb and a negative peak at 132 dafb the tw mf treatment did not show any positive peak at 93 dafb maintaining low values of photosynthesis and transpiration during the whole season statistical differences appeared at 93 132 and 167 dafb mostly for tw mf trees which maintained lower photosynthesis than tw and stw trees cumulative daily photosynthesis for the whole canopy estimated at the end of the 2017 growing season highlighted differences among treatments fig 7 a indeed tw mf trees reached the highest daily co2 assimilation with 20 68 g d 1 then followed by stw that reached 10 84 g d 1 and eventually by tw trees with 5 37 g d 1 each treatment was significantly different from each other the same pattern was shown by daily transpiration although in this case no statistical differences between tw and stw trees appeared fig 7b 3 6 fruit growth yield and fruit quality the seasonal pattern of fruit diameter showed the same trend for all treatments with reduced growth for tw and tw mf trees at 93 and 100 dafb fig 8 the stw treatment kept highest values in fruit dimeter for almost all the season if compared to the other two statistical differences were recorded at 85 93 100 121 dafb mainly between the tw and stw but no differences were detected at 111 dafb the total fruit yield was more than doubled for the tw mf and stw if compared to the tw the average tree fruit number was indeed 17 2 fruit tree 1 2 9 16 7 fruit tree 1 3 0 and 7 6 fruit tree 1 1 1 for the tw mf stw and tw treatments respectively at the end of the 2017 season tw mf trees exhibited the highest vegetative reproductive ratio 0 11 m2 fruit 1 0 019 compared to the much lower values of stw 0 05 m2 fruit 1 0 007 and tw 0 02 m2 fruit 1 0 002 the fruit quality analysis showed how the irrigation treatments affected in a consistent way almost all traits dry matter firmness and soluble solids content fig 9 tw mf fruit always showed the highest values for these parameters while tw and stw fruit showed similar values for all the others parameters fresh weight chroma a chroma b and lightness l no statistical difference among treatments was recorded 4 discussion the chemical features of the stw and tw waters table 1 measured during the experiment revealed several differences in their composition stw was characterized by a higher concentration for almost all fertility elements like n p k ca mg and organic matter this natural richness in mineral elements represents an important and free source of nutrients for improving soil fertility plant growth crop yield and preventing lack of macro and micro nutrients the availability of these elements could allow a significant reduction in fertilizer application while still meeting tree nutrient requirements as it has been reported from other studies on fruit trees pedrero et al 2012 vivaldi et al 2017 in our experimental conditions the supply of stw as irrigation source allowed to save 28 3 49 0 and 77 7 of n p and k respectively compared to tw mf in any case the potential nutrient supply is highly heterogeneous among treated wastewater sources depending mostly on the quality of the water raw arriving to the treatment plant and to the reclaiming process levy et al 2011 for these reasons fertilizer savings can highly differ among treated wastewater sources even if stw showed higher ph sar ec heavy metal e g zn fe and cu contents and e coli load than tw table 1 it did not exceed the italian thresholds for reclaimed water for agricultural purpose ministerial decree no 185 2003 these data highlight how this stw could be safely used also on crops that are considered salt stress sensible such as nectarine without showing any phytotoxic effect or salt stress sensibility ayers and westcot 1985 maas and grattan 1999 the low salinity effects recorded in our trial could be due both to the low ec values of stw compared to other treated wastewater sources qian and mecha 2005 and to the soil properties e g soil texture ph caco3 content that probably reduced the possible soil salinization and heavy metal soil accumulation however as our trial was carried out for only two years we cannot exclude the possibility of long term accumulation of salt in the soil when treated wastewater is applied for several years in open field conditions dridi et al 2017 treated wastewater could indeed affect negatively soil physical properties i e saturated hydraulic conductivity ks sepaskhah and sokoot 2010 due to its richness in suspended solids on the other hand as reported by sepaskhah and karizi 2011 the alternate use of treated wastewater and fresh water can mitigate the negative effects on the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity treated wastewater should then be seen as an essential support to the traditional freshwater sources especially during water shortages periods concerning tree nutritional status stw could not reach the tw mf level even though it provided a higher amount of macro and micro nutrients either in inorganic or organic forms compared to tw table 2 this is confirming that nectarine is a high demanding species for n and that n delivered exclusively by stw was not enough to satisfy tree requirements on the contrary leaf p ca mg and b concentrations significantly decreased in tw mf trees this was likely due to the dilution and partitioning effect induced by a larger vegetative biomass this is in line with the highest leaf p k ca mg and b concentration recorded in tw trees table 2 which seems related to their reduced canopy growth and lower crop load these data indicate how stw irrigation may contribute to a partial fulfilment of plant nutrient requirements however beside representing a water source the amount of nutrients supplied by stw could be substantial and must be taken into consideration in the fertilization schedule in particular in case of open field applications of treated wastewater tree fertilization needs should be re assessed taking into account the different canopy development and the higher fruit yields compared to potted trees thus modifying the fertigation like effect provided by treated wastewater the fruit heavy metal concentrations were within the thresholds set for heavy metal by the fao regulation for contaminants and toxins in food and feed fao who codex alimentarius 2003 even for zn which was the most present heavy metal this result is particularly important for peach fruit which is known to maintain a functional xylem until harvest morandi et al 2007 and it represents a further confirmation towards the potential use of stw for fruit crops irrigation this outcome would be probably reduced in open field conditions where the more developed root system might not be fully in contact with the soil solution i e treated wastewater as it happens in potted trees on the other hand the volume of soil wetted by treated wastewater would be increased if compared to a reference pot e g 40 l thus limiting the soil heavy metal retention capacity mapanda et al 2005 the application of treated wastewater to nectarine trees positively affected vegetative growth during the season in terms of both shoot length and scsa in particular shoot growth data recorded in 2016 fig 1a c were not reduced in trees irrigated with stw compared to tw mf trees thus highlighting the positive nutritional effect of this alternative source for irrigation stw irrigated plants showed a more balanced shoot growth with a lower source sink ratio compared to tw mf trees likely due to the fertilization contribution provided by stw a similar response for both shoot length and scsa was recorded in 2017 fig 1b d although this season was characterized by a lower vegetative growth compared to the previous year for all treatments being potted plants already at their third leaf the good performances of tw mf and stw trees in terms of vegetative growth were confirmed by tcsa data fig 2 representing a typical and reliable index for estimating tree growth during both years in 2016 predawn stem water potential fig 3 did not show any differences among treatments and no negative effect of stw irrigation was detected in stw trees at any time during the season 161 dafb this result suggests how the possible higher values of salt added to the soil by stw did not cause any osmotic stress even after 4 months of continuous irrigation fig 3 similar results were achieved on mandarin trees irrigated with a tertiary treated wastewater ttw by nicolás et al 2016 however during the day both stem and leaf water potentials occasionally showed more negative values for tw mf and stw treatments starting from 106 dfab this behaviour could be mainly attributed to the higher availability of nutrients in both treatments which might have decreased the osmotic potential of the leaf tissues in 2017 stem water potential at 93 and 132 dafb fig 4 partially confirmed the trend recorded during the last dates of 2016 with tw mf trees showing reduced midday values below 1 5 mpa thus indicating a drought stress condition this effect can be attributed to the higher vegetative growth recorded during this season in tw mf trees which caused a higher water demand despite water availability was guaranteed to all trees during the trial the lower water potentials recorded in tw mf trees might also be caused by the addition of fertilizers few days prior measurements which temporarily increased soil salinity limiting plant water uptake this probably increased the soil osmotic potential with a further negative impact on stem wp that became more negative compared to tw and stw trees the same trend appears also for leaf wp at 93 dafb with tw mf trees exhibiting the lower midday wp in open field conditions and commercial environments this possible salinity effect might be buffered by the wider soil space explored by the roots and by the bigger tree size although further studies are necessary to asses possible salinity effects deriving from long term irrigation with treated wastewater as for leaf gas exchanges no limitation in co2 assimilation and evapotranspiration were recorded during the first half of the season in 2016 fig 5 indicating no phytotoxic effect induced by irrigation with stw indeed above threshold concentrations of b gimeno et al 2012 and na navarro et al 2011 in the soil solution can lead to stomatal closure e g especially in controlled and limited conditions as in pots which in turn may reduce transpiration rate and photosynthesis garcía sánchez and syvertsen 2006 similar and positive results were achieved by nicolás et al 2016 on mandarin trees however as a consequence of their reduced water potentials tw mf trees showed a reduction in both a and e at 127 dafb indicating the presence of some water stress however in 2017 tw mf trees are the ones showing the best performance in terms of total amount of co2 assimilated fig 7 although this result is mainly related to their highest leaf canopy area it is interesting to notice how stw trees still maintain a higher assimilation capacity compared to tw due to the beneficial nutritional effect of irrigation with stw with no negative effect in vegetative growth and water potentials as a result of this optimal balance between vegetative and reproductive sinks stw trees showed the highest fruit growth rates during the season fig 8 and final yield comparable to tw mf trees this is particularly interesting from the commercial point of view size is currently the only quality trait that is paid to the grower especially if this effect is maintained also on trees cultivated in open filed condition as reported by pedrero et al 2012 pedrero et al 2014 and nicolás et al 2016 for mandarin and grapefruit trees besides stw fruit maintained similar quality levels in terms of dry matter percentage firmness and colour than what recorded for tw fruit but increased their soluble solids content indicating an overall positive effect of stw irrigation on nectarine fruit quality ahmed et al 2009 on the contrary tw mf trees showed reduced fruit growth rates during the season this must be attributed to the higher competition with the vegetative growth as a consequence of the higher vegetative reproductive ratio compared to stw and tw trees a further reason for limiting fruit growth in tw mf trees is represented by their midday stem water potential that were below the thresholds of water stress naor 1999 despite the lower fruit size the presence of stress in tw mf trees positively affected other fruit quality traits such as dry matter percentage and soluble solids content this effect must be attributed to the lower stem water potential which might have reduced xylem flows to the fruit morandi et al 2007 thus increasing the relative contribution of the phloem to nectarine fruit growth 5 conclusions this study considers for the first time the physiological nutritional and productive effects of using stw as an alternative source of irrigation in fruit crops results show how stw irrigation in controlled conditions for two subsequent seasons did not induce any negative effect on plant leaf water status and gas exchanges thus suggesting the lack of phytotoxic effects and heavy metal accumulation neither in the vegetative leaves nor in the reproductive fruit tissues on the contrary it induced a positive effect on total canopy assimilation and improved tree source sink ratio with positive effects on fruit growth fruit yield and quality due to the beneficial nutritional effect of stw at total canopy level indeed stw could partially contribute to fulfil plant nutrient requirements even though fertilization must necessarily be integrated by alternative sources e g mineral or organic fertilizers these positive results suggest how stw could be used as a potential alternative source for irrigation of fruit trees in presence of water scarcity and how it may represent a free source of nutrients reducing the need of mineral fertilizers and being at the same time beneficial also for the environment limiting eutrophication problems the use of stw as an alternative source for irrigation is particularly suitable for orchards irrigated with typical drip irrigation systems as fruit are not wet by irrigation thus decreasing the risk for external contaminations however further studies are necessary to investigate on the potential translocation of pollutants e g human pathogenic bacteria to the edible tissues in order to guarantee the safety of the fruit harvested moreover interdisciplinary feasibility studies should be conducted in open field orchards for a longer period in order to avoid possible limitations typical of potted trees and evaluate possible long term effects deriving from the continuous irrigation with treated wastewater 
10988,climate change is believed to have a large impact on water resources system both globally and regionally it has become a major global issue especially in developing countries because these are most affected by its impacts rainwater harvesting techniques offer an alternative source of water and represent specific adaptive strategies to cope with water scarcity within future climate change studying the impact of climate change on rainwater harvesting techniques however is difficult because the general circulation models gcms which are widely used to simulate scenarios of future climate change operate on a coarse scale we estimated the impact of climate change on water availability at the watershed level by downscaling precipitation and temperature from the gcms using a statistical downscaling model a water harvesting model then assessed the performance of the rainwater harvesting techniques for the oum zessar watershed in southeastern tunisia under current climatic conditions and scenarios of future climate change annual temperature tended to increase and precipitation tended to decrease these changes of climatic variables were used in the water harvesting model to simulate future water availability changing the directions of water flow between sub catchments in combination with changing the spillway heights strongly affected the performance of rainwater harvesting under the scenarios of future climate resulting in a sufficient water supply for 92 of all sub catchments compared to 72 without these changes keywords climate change gcms sdsm water harvesting model tunisia 1 introduction arid and semi arid regions asars around the world are facing serious challenges of water availability climate change is a very serious phenomenon and has become a major global issue in recent years especially in developing countries strongly affected by its impacts multiple climate models predict that climate change would amplify the intensity and frequency of droughts and thus decrease water availability particularly in semiarid regions li et al 2018 the united nations framework convention on climate change defines climate change as a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods www unfccc int the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014b predicts that the global mean surface temperature will probably increase by 0 3 0 7 c during 2016 2035 and by 2 6 4 8 c during 2081 2100 higher temperatures lead to higher evaporation rates to a higher frequency of droughts and to reductions in streamflow rind et al 1990 tunisia is amongst the lowest water use countries 450 m3 capita y and amongst the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change marh 2011 climatic projections applied to tunisia have shown that the average temperature will increase by 1

tunisia will face a scarcity of water inhabitants of asars are adapting rainwater harvesting rwh techniques to provide an alternative source of water to meet the increasing demand ammar et al 2016 rwh represents a specific adaptive strategy to cope with water scarcity and future climate change mukheibir 2008 climatic variables and scenarios of climate change must be developed on a regional or even site specific scale to ensure the success and sustainability of adapting rwh techniques to the impacts of climate change wilby and wigley 2000 projections of climatic variables must be downscaled from the results of general circulation models gcms to provide these values i e the climatic projections should be translated from coarse resolution gcms to finer resolutions using either dynamic or statistical methods ipcc tgic 2007 different methodologies can assess the impact of climate change on rwh water availability runoff and water balance within large catchments chiew et al 1995 but only a few studies have focused on small sub catchments abouabdillah 2010 applied the swat2005 model to study the impact to central tunisia of three scenarios of future climates generated with the canadian global coupled model cgcm 3 1 the data for precipitation and temperature were generated using statistically downscaling of the cgcms and the potential impact of climate change on flow evapotranspiration and soil moisture across this catchment was analysed al ansari et al 2014 tested the projected validity of rwh techniques in the iraqi province of sulaimaniyah using data based on global climatic projections provided by the hadcm3 gcm climatic and hydrological models have not supplied adaptive strategies for optimising rwh effectiveness in asars analysing the performance and efficiency of rwh techniques for the collection storage and use of the scarce water is therefore necessary the potential redesign of rwh structures to adapt to future conditions requires more study as well we developed a tool to assess the performance of existing rwh techniques and to improve the design of the rwh structures adham et al 2016b the main objective of the present study was to investigate the impact of climate change on rwh by assessing the performance of current rwh systems for our case study area the oum zessar watershed in southeastern tunisia under different climatic scenarios potential adaptive strategies for optimising rwh effectiveness to mitigate the impact of the predicted climate change were also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data used the oum zessar watershed in the province of medenine in southeastern tunisia covers an area of 367 km2 a 50 ha catchment in the upstream area of the watershed was selected for this case study this catchment consists of 25 sub catchments fig 1 the area is characterised by an arid mediterranean climate with a rainfall of 150 230 mm y an annual temperature of 19 22 c and a potential evapotranspiration of 1450 mm y adham et al 2016a local farmers have built two main types of rwh structures to cope with water scarcity and to harvest rainfall runoff for satisfying the water requirements of rainfed crops and trees jessour in areas with moderate to steep slopes and tabias in gently sloping foothills two types of data were required for our study the first type was used for downscaling and modelling climate change daily precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature data were collected from two nearby meteorological stations at the institute des régions arides ira and medenine tunisia daily data for large scale predictor variables representing current climatic conditions 1961 2005 were derived by reanalysing the data from the national centres for environmental prediction ncep and the national centre for atmosphere research ncar the ncep data were downloaded from the canadian climate data and scenarios website http ccds dscc ec gc ca the second type of data consisted of the input data for the water harvesting model whcatch adham et al 2016b to gather these data physical characteristics of each sub catchment under consideration were measured soil texture was obtained by collecting samples and the slope of the area was determined in each sub catchment using a digital elevation model dem and a geographic information system gis rates of infiltration were measured in the field using a double ring infiltrometer and the runoff coefficients were measured using a rainfall simulator at a number of locations in each sub catchment adham et al 2016b 2 2 methodology overview the impacts of climate change on the effects of the rwh techniques were assessed by 1 applying gcms to simulate climatic variables at a large scale and to project scenarios of future global climate 2 downscaling the large scale meteorological variables to local scales 3 using the whcatch model to simulate the effects of climate change on the rwh techniques and to optimise the rwh structures to mitigate the impact of the change 2 2 1 gcms and climate change scenarios the fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 started releasing gcm climate change data in 2011 encompassing simulations from more than 20 research groups and 50 models lebel et al 2015 gcms are numerically coupled models representing various earth systems including the atmosphere oceans land surface and sea ice gcms are generally used to simulate the present climate and to project future climate with forcing by greenhouse gases and aerosols dibike and coulibaly 2005 the gcms were primarily developed in 1956 to simulate average synoptic scale patterns of atmospheric circulation but various other gcms have been designed and developed since for forecasting the weather understanding the climate and predicting future climate changes xu 1999 we used only one model the second generation canadian earth system model canesm2 canesm2 has been commonly used for various regions it was developed by the canadian centre for climate modelling and analysis cccma of environment canada we used canesm2 because it is the only model that produces daily predictor variables that can be directly applied to the statistical downscaling model sdsm canesm2 was prepared for cmip5 basically as the contribution to ipcc s fifth assessment report ar5 taylor et al 2012 cccma provided the ncep ncar predictor variables in addition to the large scale atmospheric variables from canesm2 for the same period 1961 2005 and also the same variables both the ncep ncar and canesm2 data were downloaded from the canadian climate data and scenarios website http ccds dscc ec gc ca the canesm2 outputs were downloaded for three climatic scenarios representative concentration pathway rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 which were used in this study these scenarios were developed and used recently for preparing ar5 the rcp 2 6 was developed by the image modelling team of the pbl netherlands environmental assessment agency the rcp 2 6 is a representative for scenarios in the literature leading to very low greenhouse gas concentration levels van vuuren et al 2011 the rcp 4 5 was developed by the gcam modelling group at the pacific northwest national laboratory s joint global change research institute jgcri in the united states it is a stabilization scenario where total radiative forcing is stabilized before 2100 by employment of a range of technologies and strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions rajesh 2015 the rcp 8 5 was developed by the message modelling team and the integrated assessment framework at the international institute for applied system analysis iiasa in austria the rcp 8 5 is characterized by increasing greenhouse gas emissions over time representating those scenarios in the literature which lead to high greenhouse gas concentration levels thomson et al 2011 climatic scenarios refer to plausible future climates they are images of the future or an alternative future setegn et al 2011 climatic scenarios have become an important element in research on climate change because they allow us to understand the long term consequences and describe plausible pathways of future climatic conditions moss et al 2010 daily data for precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature were extracted from canesm2 to be used in the whcatch model to assess the impact of climate change on rwh for the three scenarios rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 2 2 2 downscaling methods gcms are coarse in resolution and are unable to resolve important sub grid scale features such as topography and land use grotch and maccracken 1991 there is a large gap between the coarse resolution of gcms and the local watershed processes setegn et al 2011 gcms were not designed for studying the impact of climate change on a local scale and do not provide direct estimates of hydrological responses to climate change dibike and coulibaly 2005 a hydrological model is therefore necessary for studying the impacts of climate change on sub grid scales hydrological models need data at similar to sub grid scales so the methods used to translate gcm outputs into local meteorological variables required for reliable hydrological modelling are referred to as downscaling techniques dibike and coulibaly 2005 dynamic and statistical downscaling are the two main approaches available for downscaling the results of computations by gcms the statistical approach as used in this study establishes empirical relationships between local climatic variables predictands and large scale atmospheric variables predictors statistical downscaling is less technically demanding than original modelling computationally cheaper and can tailor scenarios for specific localities scales and problems setegn et al 2011 the main drawback is the assumption that the statistical relationships developed for the present climate also hold under the different forcing conditions of a possible future climate abdo et al 2009 formally the concept of conditioning the regional climate by the large scale state may be written as 1 r f l where r is the predictand l is the predictor a set of large scale climatic variables and f is a deterministic stochastic function conditioned by l that must be derived empirically from historical observations or modelled data sets dibike and coulibaly 2005 2 2 2 1 statistical downscaling model sdsm 4 2 sdsm is a statistical downscaling tool widely applied in climatic studies it is a hybrid model that uses linear regression and a stochastic weather generator hassan et al 2014 it is a decision support tool developed by wilby et al 2002 for assessing the impact of local climate change using statistical downscaling this model was downloaded from the website http co public lboro ac uk cocwd sdsm we used the output of canesm2 as the predictor and rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 were used for the generation of future data sdsm establishes the empirical relationship function f in eq 1 between the predictors and predictands the model has four main parts identification of the predictands and predictors model calibration weather generation and generation of a future series of climatic variables scenario generation the quality control module in sdsm can assess the performance of the predictands precipitation and temperature to identify errors missing data and outliers in the data records we applied a transformation of the fourth root to account for the skewed nature of the rainfall distribution hassan et al 2014 some parameters such as threshold event bias correction and variance inflation were adjusted several times during the calibration of sdsm until the statistical agreement between the observed and simulated outputs was highest for precipitation the sdsm default values for these parameters were then used for temperature the unconditional process and the monthly model were applied for temperature and a conditional process was applied for precipitation in an unconditional process it is assumed that there is a direct link between predictor and predictand and whereas conditional assumes the existence of intermediate processes between regional forcing and local weather 2 2 2 2 downscaling daily rainfall and temperature time series daily precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature were chosen as the predictand variables for the downscaling experiments precipitation and temperature have been measured at the medenine meteorological station near our study area for 32 years 1978 2010 the large scale predictor variables representing the current climatic conditions were derived from the reanalysed ncep data for 1961 2005 to make a consistent data set of predictand and predictor variables we assumed the data got the period from 1961 to 1978 as missing data and assigned 999 to them to be applicable with the sdsm program the other climatic variables for the future scenarios were extracted from the canesm2 location that was closest to the study area data were ultimately extracted for three periods of 30 years each from 2011 to 2100 the 20 s 2011 2040 50 s 2041 2070 and 80 s 2071 2100 2 2 2 3 calibration and validation of sdsm the first 30 of the 45 years of the current climatic data 1961 1990 were used for calibrating the regression models and the remaining 15 years of data 1991 2005 were used for sdsm validation sdsm calibration computes the parameters of multiple regression equations for a set of probable predictors and each predictand dibike and coulibaly 2005 the performance of the sdsm was evaluated using the coefficient of determination r 2 r 2 is a comparison of the variance of the modelled data with the total variance of the observed data shrestha et al 2015 the weather generator module in sdsm was used for the validation we then used the summary statistics and frequency analysis in sdsm to compare the observed and simulated climatological data for the 15 years 1991 2005 2 2 3 water harvesting model whcatch hydrological models are mathematical formulations that can determine the volume of runoff leaving a watershed from the rainfall received by the watershed abdo et al 2009 we applied the simple model whcatch adham et al 2016b for 25 sub catchments in the oum zessar watershed to assess the performance of the rwh techniques based on current and future climatic conditions the change of water storage within the volume was calculated as the difference between total input and output the water balance equation of an area can be written in units of volume m3 as boers et al 1986 2 δ s i q where δs is the change in storage during a defined period of time i is the inflow and q is the outflow all in m3 recognition of the various types of in and outflow allows a more detailed water balance equation 3 δ s q r u n o f f q r a i n f a l l q i n q o u t q l o s s where qrunoff is the volume of runoff into the retention basin from the runoff area qrainfall is the rainfall in the retention basin qin is the volume of inflow from upstream catchment s qout is the volume of overflow from the retention basin to the next catchment s and qloss represents the losses by infiltration from the retention basin and the crop evapotranspiration the thornthwaite equation was applied to estimate the potential evapotranspiration in each sub catchment xu and singh 2001 4 e t 16 l 12 n 30 10 t a i where et is the potential evapotranspiration mm month ta is the average daily temperature o c if this is negative use 0 n is the number of days in the month being calculated l is the average day length hours of the considered month and α is a parameter that is calculated as 5 6 75 10 7 i 3 7 71 10 5 i 2 1 792 10 2 i 0 49239 with 6 i i 1 12 t a i 5 1 514 where i is the heat index which depends on the 12 monthly mean temperatures tai the maximum crop evapotranspiration etc was calculated by 7 e t c e t k c where kc is the crop coefficient the output data of canesm2 for the three representative climate scenario s rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 were used as input data for whcatch and the output was compared with the results for the current climatic variables the volume of water that could be harvested in each sub catchment was calculated and presented for the current baseline 1981 2010 period and the future periods 2011 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 similar periods of climatic scenarios to achieve the adaptive goal of rwh for the future climatic scenarios we changed the spillway heights and flow directions to optimise the performance of the rwh structures and to improve the yield water availability of the rwh system under the future climatic conditions 3 results and discussion here we will first look at the results of downscaling the climate scenario s for the study area these will then be applied in the rainwater harvesting model 3 1 statistical downscaling sdsm 4 2 was applied to assess the impact of local climate change using a statistical downscaling technique four main steps were applied the predictor variables were selected the calibration and validation of sdsm were evaluated second and third steps and a series of future climatic variables projection of temperature and precipitation was generated 3 1 1 selection of predictor variables the choice of predictor variables is a major problem in the development of statistical downscaling the screening option in sdsm assists in choosing the appropriate predictor variables for downscaling the predictor variables from the reanalysed ncep ncar 1961 2005 data were chosen to investigate the percentage of variance explained by each predictand predictor pair the final set of predictor variables was selected after analysing the significance level p and correlation coefficient partial r where each predictor was selected based on the highest correlation and smaller p value with each predictand table 1 the procedure for selecting the predictor variables was similar to that used in other studies wilby et al 2002 dibike and coulibaly 2005 hassan et al 2014 air temperature at a height of 2 m was the dominant predictor variable for both maximum and minimum temperature table 1 this variable has the highest impact on temperature and is expected to generate a temperature in response to a climatic scenario hassan et al 2014 total precipitation was the dominant predictor variable for precipitation some predictor variables e g p1 ugl were poorly correlated with precipitation r 0 104 but were selected because combinations of one or more of them were able to describe the conditional process for precipitation the selection of predictor variables for maximum and minimum temperature was easier than for the rainfall predictor variables because rainfall is under condition process 3 1 2 sdsm performance sdsm performance was evaluated by downscaling the temperature and precipitation for the study area the calibration module in sdsm was applied automatically to evaluate the performance of sdsm using r 2 for the first 30 years 1961 1990 the r 2 values were 0 74 0 64 and 0 28 for maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin and precipitation prcp respectively these results indicated that sdsm performed well for downscaling maximum and minimum temperature but not for precipitation which was more complex than temperature fowler et al 2007 the complexity of downscaling rainfall is due to the conditional process which is dependent on another intermediate process inside the rainfall process such as humidity cloud cover and or wet days hassan et al 2014 the weather generator module in sdsm was used for validation the observed data and results of the climatic simulation were then compared using summary and frequency analysis in sdsm for 1991 2005 fig 2 comparisons of the monthly mean maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation indicated a good agreement between the observed and simulated outputs for tmax and tmin which were very similar the precipitation data however differed more especially in march and august the r 2 values were 0 97 0 95 and 0 46 for tmax tmin and precipitation respectively these results indicated that sdsm performed well for the validation but not for the calibration of precipitation perhaps due to missing rainfall data observed which negatively affected the performance of sdsm overall the agreement between the observed and simulated monthly tmax tmin and prcp was satisfactory 3 1 3 projection of temperature and precipitation the next step after validation was to use sdsm 4 2 to downscale the future scenario of climate change simulated by gcm as explained above the output from canesm2 provided the predictors used in this study the future climatic variables for rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 based on the mean of 20 ensembles were analysed for each 30 year period i e 20 s 2011 2040 50 s 2041 2070 and 80 s 2071 2100 the data for the baseline period 1981 2010 were compared with the future data the downscaled maximum and minimum temperatures clearly indicated an increasing trend in the mean monthly temperature for all three scenarios and all future periods fig 3 the mean annual maximum temperature under rcp 2 6 increased by 2 33 and 3 32 c in the 20 s and 50 s periods respectively the increase in the mean annual maximum temperature was slightly lower at 3 29 c by the end of this century compared with the 50 s period the mean annual temperature increased in rcp 4 5 in all three periods the increases in the maximum future temperatures were highest in rcp 8 5 2 61 c in 20 s 5 39 c in 50 s and 8 96 c in 80 s table 2 rcp 8 5 assumed higher emissions of greenhouse gases than rcp 4 5 rajesh 2015 and rcp 2 6 usually assumed the lowest emission due to mitigate activities van vuuren et al 2011 the mean annual maximum temperature increased in all months except in may when the temperature was slightly lower for all scenarios in all periods temperature only increased in may in rcp 8 5 for the 80 s period fig 3 the mean annual minimum temperature also increased in all three scenarios in all periods and months table 2 the mean annual minimum temperature increased in rcp 2 6 by 3 98 c in 20 s and by 4 63 c in 50 s and the increase was slightly lower at 4 61 c by the end of this century as with the maximum temperature the mean annual minimum temperature increased in rcp 4 5 during all periods the minimum temperature increased most in rcp 8 5 4 13 5 98 and 8 45 c in 20 s 50 s and 80 s respectively table 2 and fig 3 mean annual minimum temperature increased substantially during summer june september especially in rcp 8 5 but increased only slightly in may the increases in the mean maximum and minimum temperatures were generally slightly higher than those in earlier studies marh 2011 but our results are consistent with an increasing trend for the 21th century this study is the first to apply new scenarios based on cmip5 modelling to this region potential evapotranspiration is projected to increase in the future due to the impact of increasing temperatures fig 4 a monthly et values show a similar pattern in all three scenarios but rcp 8 5 increases more than the other two scenarios especially during june to september the annual mean potential et is likely to increase by 6 in rcp 2 6 in 20 s to 21 in rcp 8 5 in 80 s table 2 the projection for precipitation indicated a decreasing trend in the mean annual daily precipitation for the three scenarios in all periods fig 4b the mean annual daily precipitation decreased in rcp 2 6 by 27 in 20 s 37 in 50 s and 29 in 80 s and in rcp 4 5 by about 30 in 20 s and 80 s and by 33 in 50 s the mean annual daily precipitation decreased most in rcp 8 5 by 36 in both 20 s and 80 s and by about 32 in 50 s table 2 these changes in precipitation varied monthly the largest decrease was in march and october in all scenarios and periods the mean annual daily precipitation increased slightly in rcp 2 6 in february 50 s in rcp 4 5 in february 80 s and november 80 s and 20 s and in rcp 8 5 in may and september 80 s fig 4b the pattern was similar in rcp 2 6 and 4 5 but with some differences whereas the pattern was much different in rcp 8 5 in september to december in 20 s and 80 s compared with the base these results are generally consistent with the climatic projections in a tunisian case study which reported that rainfall would decrease between 10 in the north and 30 in the south in the same period marh 2011 to gain more insight in the predicted precipitation and the expected changes the generated rcp4 5 dataset was analysed and compared with the baseline precipitation period of 1981 2010 to do so first the distribution of the daily amounts of precipitation was computed the cumulative probabilities are shows in fig 5 a fig 5a shows that the probability of a day with rainfall was only 7 for the years 1981 2010 while the probability increases to 16 14 and 14 for the periods 2011 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 respectively the chance of a rainfall event of 2 5 mm or more is 3 1 8 1 5 and 1 9 for the different periods the larger the amount of precipitation the smaller the differences between the periods not only the size of the precipitation events is important so is the number of them for every year considered we counted the number of events classes of precipitation of 10 mm were assumed and the number of events was counted for each class during the four periods considered the results of this simple but effective analysis are shown in fig 5b from this figure it can be seen that during the years 1981 2010 the majority of years had between 30 40 precipitation events during this period there were also years with 0 10 events in the periods with generated data there were no years with less than 30 events during 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 no years occurred with more than 80 the projection results of temperature evapotranspiration and precipitation were used in the whcatch model to estimate the future water availability in each sub catchment the amount of rainfall and the change in temperature directly affected the evapotranspiration values and the water balance terms 3 2 water harvesting model whcatch the whcatch model was used to estimate future water availability for each rwh structure relative to the baseline period the sub catchments and flow directions are shown in fig 6 the amount of water that will be caught by each rwh structure is highly dependent on the amount of precipitation in its sub catchment and on the actual evapotranspiration changes in precipitation and temperature will therefore have a direct impact on the availability of water and on the performance of rwh in general the simulations for each sub catchment for rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 for the 20 s 2011 2040 50 s 2041 2070 and 80 s 2071 2100 are compared with the baseline period 1981 2010 and presented in fig 7 a the volume of water stored in a reservoir depends on the available runoff and the water demand the performance of rwh under current conditions was previously assessed and discussed adham et al 2016b the amount of water stored in each sub catchment decreased under the future conditions in rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 fig 7a the results of whcatch were identical to those for projected precipitation fig 4b about 72 of the sub catchments were able to meet the water requirements in the baseline period for future scenarios about 30 in rcp 2 6 25 in rcp 4 5 in all periods and 50 for rcp 8 5 in 20 s and 50 s will be able to meet the water requirements fig 7a whereas only 25 of the sub catchments for 80 s in the rcp 8 5 able to meet the water requirements zero values of harvested rainwater for the sub catchments however indicated the inability of rwh to meet the water requirements the zero values were due to reasons such as insufficient storage capacity suboptimal height of the spillway direction of streamflow adham et al 2016b the watershed runoff relationship in asars has long been reported the volume of the harvested runoff is directly proportional to the size and length of the runoff harvesting structure adham et al 2018 most of the rwh structures built by farmers in asars are washed away due to the insufficient capacity of spillways adham et al 2016b spillways with sufficient capacity and at the right location must therefore be provided field observations and the analysis of the water balance indicated that most of the runoff flowed in one direction fig 6a adham et al 2016b reported that changing spillway heights together with flow directions substantially increased rainwater availability under current climatic conditions for the proposed rwh solutions compared to the results for traditional designs the analyses with whcatch indicated that changing spillway heights together with flow directions fig 6b for optimising the performance of the rwh structures and improving the yield water availability of the rwh system based on the projected future climatic conditions fig 7b substantially increased the performance of rwh increasing the efficiency of water availability in 92 of all sub catchments in the baseline period in all three rcp scenarios compared to 72 without the changes the efficiency of water availability will be increased almost double in both scenarios rcp 2 6 and 4 5 in all periods compared to the sub catchments without changes whereas the efficiency of water availability will be the same for 80 s in rcp 2 6 moreover about 80 of the sub catchments in the rcp 8 5 in 20 s and 50 s will be able to meet the water requirements compared to 50 without the changes fig 7b and table 3 fig 8b shows that the first four rwh structure sub catchments have no big significant change with this scenario these results are due to a relatively small runoff area in the first three structures whereas the structure was broken in the fourth site and we considered it works as a runoff area harvested rainwater increased in all three rcps table 3 table 3 confirmed that the increasing of the water supply in most sub catchments are more depend on the water management and structure design than climate change scenarios itself 4 conclusions this study demonstrated the feasibility of rainwater harvesting as an adaptive strategy to mitigate water scarcity and to improve water availability now and under changing climatic conditions analysing our generated data showed that both the minimum and maximum temperatures tended to increase and precipitation tended to decrease in all scenarios of future emissions of greenhouse gases in most periods 20 s 50 s and 80 s the increase in temperature yields an increase in potential evapotranspiration as well changing the flow directions combined with increasing the heights of spillways had a large impact on the performance of the rainwater harvesting structures water availability fulfilled the demand in 92 of the sub catchments compared to only 72 without these adaptive measures in all the scenarios of climate change therefore at sub catchments level water management and structure design play a more important role in the performance of rainwater harvesting rather than climate change itself the results could be important for designers decision makers and farmers for adapting to the forthcoming climatic conditions and or for mitigating the adverse impacts of a changing climate on water resources further research however is required to include multiple general circulation models gcms and downscaling models under coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 and to consider changes in land use cover in simulation models to better understand the impact

10988,climate change is believed to have a large impact on water resources system both globally and regionally it has become a major global issue especially in developing countries because these are most affected by its impacts rainwater harvesting techniques offer an alternative source of water and represent specific adaptive strategies to cope with water scarcity within future climate change studying the impact of climate change on rainwater harvesting techniques however is difficult because the general circulation models gcms which are widely used to simulate scenarios of future climate change operate on a coarse scale we estimated the impact of climate change on water availability at the watershed level by downscaling precipitation and temperature from the gcms using a statistical downscaling model a water harvesting model then assessed the performance of the rainwater harvesting techniques for the oum zessar watershed in southeastern tunisia under current climatic conditions and scenarios of future climate change annual temperature tended to increase and precipitation tended to decrease these changes of climatic variables were used in the water harvesting model to simulate future water availability changing the directions of water flow between sub catchments in combination with changing the spillway heights strongly affected the performance of rainwater harvesting under the scenarios of future climate resulting in a sufficient water supply for 92 of all sub catchments compared to 72 without these changes keywords climate change gcms sdsm water harvesting model tunisia 1 introduction arid and semi arid regions asars around the world are facing serious challenges of water availability climate change is a very serious phenomenon and has become a major global issue in recent years especially in developing countries strongly affected by its impacts multiple climate models predict that climate change would amplify the intensity and frequency of droughts and thus decrease water availability particularly in semiarid regions li et al 2018 the united nations framework convention on climate change defines climate change as a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods www unfccc int the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014b predicts that the global mean surface temperature will probably increase by 0 3 0 7 c during 2016 2035 and by 2 6 4 8 c during 2081 2100 higher temperatures lead to higher evaporation rates to a higher frequency of droughts and to reductions in streamflow rind et al 1990 tunisia is amongst the lowest water use countries 450 m3 capita y and amongst the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change marh 2011 climatic projections applied to tunisia have shown that the average temperature will increase by 1 1 c by 2030 and by 2 1 c by 2050 combining these numbers with a decrease of rainfall which is predicted to be between 10 in the north and 30 in the south during the same period marh 2011 suggests that tunisia will face a scarcity of water inhabitants of asars are adapting rainwater harvesting rwh techniques to provide an alternative source of water to meet the increasing demand ammar et al 2016 rwh represents a specific adaptive strategy to cope with water scarcity and future climate change mukheibir 2008 climatic variables and scenarios of climate change must be developed on a regional or even site specific scale to ensure the success and sustainability of adapting rwh techniques to the impacts of climate change wilby and wigley 2000 projections of climatic variables must be downscaled from the results of general circulation models gcms to provide these values i e the climatic projections should be translated from coarse resolution gcms to finer resolutions using either dynamic or statistical methods ipcc tgic 2007 different methodologies can assess the impact of climate change on rwh water availability runoff and water balance within large catchments chiew et al 1995 but only a few studies have focused on small sub catchments abouabdillah 2010 applied the swat2005 model to study the impact to central tunisia of three scenarios of future climates generated with the canadian global coupled model cgcm 3 1 the data for precipitation and temperature were generated using statistically downscaling of the cgcms and the potential impact of climate change on flow evapotranspiration and soil moisture across this catchment was analysed al ansari et al 2014 tested the projected validity of rwh techniques in the iraqi province of sulaimaniyah using data based on global climatic projections provided by the hadcm3 gcm climatic and hydrological models have not supplied adaptive strategies for optimising rwh effectiveness in asars analysing the performance and efficiency of rwh techniques for the collection storage and use of the scarce water is therefore necessary the potential redesign of rwh structures to adapt to future conditions requires more study as well we developed a tool to assess the performance of existing rwh techniques and to improve the design of the rwh structures adham et al 2016b the main objective of the present study was to investigate the impact of climate change on rwh by assessing the performance of current rwh systems for our case study area the oum zessar watershed in southeastern tunisia under different climatic scenarios potential adaptive strategies for optimising rwh effectiveness to mitigate the impact of the predicted climate change were also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data used the oum zessar watershed in the province of medenine in southeastern tunisia covers an area of 367 km2 a 50 ha catchment in the upstream area of the watershed was selected for this case study this catchment consists of 25 sub catchments fig 1 the area is characterised by an arid mediterranean climate with a rainfall of 150 230 mm y an annual temperature of 19 22 c and a potential evapotranspiration of 1450 mm y adham et al 2016a local farmers have built two main types of rwh structures to cope with water scarcity and to harvest rainfall runoff for satisfying the water requirements of rainfed crops and trees jessour in areas with moderate to steep slopes and tabias in gently sloping foothills two types of data were required for our study the first type was used for downscaling and modelling climate change daily precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature data were collected from two nearby meteorological stations at the institute des régions arides ira and medenine tunisia daily data for large scale predictor variables representing current climatic conditions 1961 2005 were derived by reanalysing the data from the national centres for environmental prediction ncep and the national centre for atmosphere research ncar the ncep data were downloaded from the canadian climate data and scenarios website http ccds dscc ec gc ca the second type of data consisted of the input data for the water harvesting model whcatch adham et al 2016b to gather these data physical characteristics of each sub catchment under consideration were measured soil texture was obtained by collecting samples and the slope of the area was determined in each sub catchment using a digital elevation model dem and a geographic information system gis rates of infiltration were measured in the field using a double ring infiltrometer and the runoff coefficients were measured using a rainfall simulator at a number of locations in each sub catchment adham et al 2016b 2 2 methodology overview the impacts of climate change on the effects of the rwh techniques were assessed by 1 applying gcms to simulate climatic variables at a large scale and to project scenarios of future global climate 2 downscaling the large scale meteorological variables to local scales 3 using the whcatch model to simulate the effects of climate change on the rwh techniques and to optimise the rwh structures to mitigate the impact of the change 2 2 1 gcms and climate change scenarios the fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 started releasing gcm climate change data in 2011 encompassing simulations from more than 20 research groups and 50 models lebel et al 2015 gcms are numerically coupled models representing various earth systems including the atmosphere oceans land surface and sea ice gcms are generally used to simulate the present climate and to project future climate with forcing by greenhouse gases and aerosols dibike and coulibaly 2005 the gcms were primarily developed in 1956 to simulate average synoptic scale patterns of atmospheric circulation but various other gcms have been designed and developed since for forecasting the weather understanding the climate and predicting future climate changes xu 1999 we used only one model the second generation canadian earth system model canesm2 canesm2 has been commonly used for various regions it was developed by the canadian centre for climate modelling and analysis cccma of environment canada we used canesm2 because it is the only model that produces daily predictor variables that can be directly applied to the statistical downscaling model sdsm canesm2 was prepared for cmip5 basically as the contribution to ipcc s fifth assessment report ar5 taylor et al 2012 cccma provided the ncep ncar predictor variables in addition to the large scale atmospheric variables from canesm2 for the same period 1961 2005 and also the same variables both the ncep ncar and canesm2 data were downloaded from the canadian climate data and scenarios website http ccds dscc ec gc ca the canesm2 outputs were downloaded for three climatic scenarios representative concentration pathway rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 which were used in this study these scenarios were developed and used recently for preparing ar5 the rcp 2 6 was developed by the image modelling team of the pbl netherlands environmental assessment agency the rcp 2 6 is a representative for scenarios in the literature leading to very low greenhouse gas concentration levels van vuuren et al 2011 the rcp 4 5 was developed by the gcam modelling group at the pacific northwest national laboratory s joint global change research institute jgcri in the united states it is a stabilization scenario where total radiative forcing is stabilized before 2100 by employment of a range of technologies and strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions rajesh 2015 the rcp 8 5 was developed by the message modelling team and the integrated assessment framework at the international institute for applied system analysis iiasa in austria the rcp 8 5 is characterized by increasing greenhouse gas emissions over time representating those scenarios in the literature which lead to high greenhouse gas concentration levels thomson et al 2011 climatic scenarios refer to plausible future climates they are images of the future or an alternative future setegn et al 2011 climatic scenarios have become an important element in research on climate change because they allow us to understand the long term consequences and describe plausible pathways of future climatic conditions moss et al 2010 daily data for precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature were extracted from canesm2 to be used in the whcatch model to assess the impact of climate change on rwh for the three scenarios rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 2 2 2 downscaling methods gcms are coarse in resolution and are unable to resolve important sub grid scale features such as topography and land use grotch and maccracken 1991 there is a large gap between the coarse resolution of gcms and the local watershed processes setegn et al 2011 gcms were not designed for studying the impact of climate change on a local scale and do not provide direct estimates of hydrological responses to climate change dibike and coulibaly 2005 a hydrological model is therefore necessary for studying the impacts of climate change on sub grid scales hydrological models need data at similar to sub grid scales so the methods used to translate gcm outputs into local meteorological variables required for reliable hydrological modelling are referred to as downscaling techniques dibike and coulibaly 2005 dynamic and statistical downscaling are the two main approaches available for downscaling the results of computations by gcms the statistical approach as used in this study establishes empirical relationships between local climatic variables predictands and large scale atmospheric variables predictors statistical downscaling is less technically demanding than original modelling computationally cheaper and can tailor scenarios for specific localities scales and problems setegn et al 2011 the main drawback is the assumption that the statistical relationships developed for the present climate also hold under the different forcing conditions of a possible future climate abdo et al 2009 formally the concept of conditioning the regional climate by the large scale state may be written as 1 r f l where r is the predictand l is the predictor a set of large scale climatic variables and f is a deterministic stochastic function conditioned by l that must be derived empirically from historical observations or modelled data sets dibike and coulibaly 2005 2 2 2 1 statistical downscaling model sdsm 4 2 sdsm is a statistical downscaling tool widely applied in climatic studies it is a hybrid model that uses linear regression and a stochastic weather generator hassan et al 2014 it is a decision support tool developed by wilby et al 2002 for assessing the impact of local climate change using statistical downscaling this model was downloaded from the website http co public lboro ac uk cocwd sdsm we used the output of canesm2 as the predictor and rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 were used for the generation of future data sdsm establishes the empirical relationship function f in eq 1 between the predictors and predictands the model has four main parts identification of the predictands and predictors model calibration weather generation and generation of a future series of climatic variables scenario generation the quality control module in sdsm can assess the performance of the predictands precipitation and temperature to identify errors missing data and outliers in the data records we applied a transformation of the fourth root to account for the skewed nature of the rainfall distribution hassan et al 2014 some parameters such as threshold event bias correction and variance inflation were adjusted several times during the calibration of sdsm until the statistical agreement between the observed and simulated outputs was highest for precipitation the sdsm default values for these parameters were then used for temperature the unconditional process and the monthly model were applied for temperature and a conditional process was applied for precipitation in an unconditional process it is assumed that there is a direct link between predictor and predictand and whereas conditional assumes the existence of intermediate processes between regional forcing and local weather 2 2 2 2 downscaling daily rainfall and temperature time series daily precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature were chosen as the predictand variables for the downscaling experiments precipitation and temperature have been measured at the medenine meteorological station near our study area for 32 years 1978 2010 the large scale predictor variables representing the current climatic conditions were derived from the reanalysed ncep data for 1961 2005 to make a consistent data set of predictand and predictor variables we assumed the data got the period from 1961 to 1978 as missing data and assigned 999 to them to be applicable with the sdsm program the other climatic variables for the future scenarios were extracted from the canesm2 location that was closest to the study area data were ultimately extracted for three periods of 30 years each from 2011 to 2100 the 20 s 2011 2040 50 s 2041 2070 and 80 s 2071 2100 2 2 2 3 calibration and validation of sdsm the first 30 of the 45 years of the current climatic data 1961 1990 were used for calibrating the regression models and the remaining 15 years of data 1991 2005 were used for sdsm validation sdsm calibration computes the parameters of multiple regression equations for a set of probable predictors and each predictand dibike and coulibaly 2005 the performance of the sdsm was evaluated using the coefficient of determination r 2 r 2 is a comparison of the variance of the modelled data with the total variance of the observed data shrestha et al 2015 the weather generator module in sdsm was used for the validation we then used the summary statistics and frequency analysis in sdsm to compare the observed and simulated climatological data for the 15 years 1991 2005 2 2 3 water harvesting model whcatch hydrological models are mathematical formulations that can determine the volume of runoff leaving a watershed from the rainfall received by the watershed abdo et al 2009 we applied the simple model whcatch adham et al 2016b for 25 sub catchments in the oum zessar watershed to assess the performance of the rwh techniques based on current and future climatic conditions the change of water storage within the volume was calculated as the difference between total input and output the water balance equation of an area can be written in units of volume m3 as boers et al 1986 2 δ s i q where δs is the change in storage during a defined period of time i is the inflow and q is the outflow all in m3 recognition of the various types of in and outflow allows a more detailed water balance equation 3 δ s q r u n o f f q r a i n f a l l q i n q o u t q l o s s where qrunoff is the volume of runoff into the retention basin from the runoff area qrainfall is the rainfall in the retention basin qin is the volume of inflow from upstream catchment s qout is the volume of overflow from the retention basin to the next catchment s and qloss represents the losses by infiltration from the retention basin and the crop evapotranspiration the thornthwaite equation was applied to estimate the potential evapotranspiration in each sub catchment xu and singh 2001 4 e t 16 l 12 n 30 10 t a i where et is the potential evapotranspiration mm month ta is the average daily temperature o c if this is negative use 0 n is the number of days in the month being calculated l is the average day length hours of the considered month and α is a parameter that is calculated as 5 6 75 10 7 i 3 7 71 10 5 i 2 1 792 10 2 i 0 49239 with 6 i i 1 12 t a i 5 1 514 where i is the heat index which depends on the 12 monthly mean temperatures tai the maximum crop evapotranspiration etc was calculated by 7 e t c e t k c where kc is the crop coefficient the output data of canesm2 for the three representative climate scenario s rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 were used as input data for whcatch and the output was compared with the results for the current climatic variables the volume of water that could be harvested in each sub catchment was calculated and presented for the current baseline 1981 2010 period and the future periods 2011 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 similar periods of climatic scenarios to achieve the adaptive goal of rwh for the future climatic scenarios we changed the spillway heights and flow directions to optimise the performance of the rwh structures and to improve the yield water availability of the rwh system under the future climatic conditions 3 results and discussion here we will first look at the results of downscaling the climate scenario s for the study area these will then be applied in the rainwater harvesting model 3 1 statistical downscaling sdsm 4 2 was applied to assess the impact of local climate change using a statistical downscaling technique four main steps were applied the predictor variables were selected the calibration and validation of sdsm were evaluated second and third steps and a series of future climatic variables projection of temperature and precipitation was generated 3 1 1 selection of predictor variables the choice of predictor variables is a major problem in the development of statistical downscaling the screening option in sdsm assists in choosing the appropriate predictor variables for downscaling the predictor variables from the reanalysed ncep ncar 1961 2005 data were chosen to investigate the percentage of variance explained by each predictand predictor pair the final set of predictor variables was selected after analysing the significance level p and correlation coefficient partial r where each predictor was selected based on the highest correlation and smaller p value with each predictand table 1 the procedure for selecting the predictor variables was similar to that used in other studies wilby et al 2002 dibike and coulibaly 2005 hassan et al 2014 air temperature at a height of 2 m was the dominant predictor variable for both maximum and minimum temperature table 1 this variable has the highest impact on temperature and is expected to generate a temperature in response to a climatic scenario hassan et al 2014 total precipitation was the dominant predictor variable for precipitation some predictor variables e g p1 ugl were poorly correlated with precipitation r 0 104 but were selected because combinations of one or more of them were able to describe the conditional process for precipitation the selection of predictor variables for maximum and minimum temperature was easier than for the rainfall predictor variables because rainfall is under condition process 3 1 2 sdsm performance sdsm performance was evaluated by downscaling the temperature and precipitation for the study area the calibration module in sdsm was applied automatically to evaluate the performance of sdsm using r 2 for the first 30 years 1961 1990 the r 2 values were 0 74 0 64 and 0 28 for maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin and precipitation prcp respectively these results indicated that sdsm performed well for downscaling maximum and minimum temperature but not for precipitation which was more complex than temperature fowler et al 2007 the complexity of downscaling rainfall is due to the conditional process which is dependent on another intermediate process inside the rainfall process such as humidity cloud cover and or wet days hassan et al 2014 the weather generator module in sdsm was used for validation the observed data and results of the climatic simulation were then compared using summary and frequency analysis in sdsm for 1991 2005 fig 2 comparisons of the monthly mean maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation indicated a good agreement between the observed and simulated outputs for tmax and tmin which were very similar the precipitation data however differed more especially in march and august the r 2 values were 0 97 0 95 and 0 46 for tmax tmin and precipitation respectively these results indicated that sdsm performed well for the validation but not for the calibration of precipitation perhaps due to missing rainfall data observed which negatively affected the performance of sdsm overall the agreement between the observed and simulated monthly tmax tmin and prcp was satisfactory 3 1 3 projection of temperature and precipitation the next step after validation was to use sdsm 4 2 to downscale the future scenario of climate change simulated by gcm as explained above the output from canesm2 provided the predictors used in this study the future climatic variables for rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 based on the mean of 20 ensembles were analysed for each 30 year period i e 20 s 2011 2040 50 s 2041 2070 and 80 s 2071 2100 the data for the baseline period 1981 2010 were compared with the future data the downscaled maximum and minimum temperatures clearly indicated an increasing trend in the mean monthly temperature for all three scenarios and all future periods fig 3 the mean annual maximum temperature under rcp 2 6 increased by 2 33 and 3 32 c in the 20 s and 50 s periods respectively the increase in the mean annual maximum temperature was slightly lower at 3 29 c by the end of this century compared with the 50 s period the mean annual temperature increased in rcp 4 5 in all three periods the increases in the maximum future temperatures were highest in rcp 8 5 2 61 c in 20 s 5 39 c in 50 s and 8 96 c in 80 s table 2 rcp 8 5 assumed higher emissions of greenhouse gases than rcp 4 5 rajesh 2015 and rcp 2 6 usually assumed the lowest emission due to mitigate activities van vuuren et al 2011 the mean annual maximum temperature increased in all months except in may when the temperature was slightly lower for all scenarios in all periods temperature only increased in may in rcp 8 5 for the 80 s period fig 3 the mean annual minimum temperature also increased in all three scenarios in all periods and months table 2 the mean annual minimum temperature increased in rcp 2 6 by 3 98 c in 20 s and by 4 63 c in 50 s and the increase was slightly lower at 4 61 c by the end of this century as with the maximum temperature the mean annual minimum temperature increased in rcp 4 5 during all periods the minimum temperature increased most in rcp 8 5 4 13 5 98 and 8 45 c in 20 s 50 s and 80 s respectively table 2 and fig 3 mean annual minimum temperature increased substantially during summer june september especially in rcp 8 5 but increased only slightly in may the increases in the mean maximum and minimum temperatures were generally slightly higher than those in earlier studies marh 2011 but our results are consistent with an increasing trend for the 21th century this study is the first to apply new scenarios based on cmip5 modelling to this region potential evapotranspiration is projected to increase in the future due to the impact of increasing temperatures fig 4 a monthly et values show a similar pattern in all three scenarios but rcp 8 5 increases more than the other two scenarios especially during june to september the annual mean potential et is likely to increase by 6 in rcp 2 6 in 20 s to 21 in rcp 8 5 in 80 s table 2 the projection for precipitation indicated a decreasing trend in the mean annual daily precipitation for the three scenarios in all periods fig 4b the mean annual daily precipitation decreased in rcp 2 6 by 27 in 20 s 37 in 50 s and 29 in 80 s and in rcp 4 5 by about 30 in 20 s and 80 s and by 33 in 50 s the mean annual daily precipitation decreased most in rcp 8 5 by 36 in both 20 s and 80 s and by about 32 in 50 s table 2 these changes in precipitation varied monthly the largest decrease was in march and october in all scenarios and periods the mean annual daily precipitation increased slightly in rcp 2 6 in february 50 s in rcp 4 5 in february 80 s and november 80 s and 20 s and in rcp 8 5 in may and september 80 s fig 4b the pattern was similar in rcp 2 6 and 4 5 but with some differences whereas the pattern was much different in rcp 8 5 in september to december in 20 s and 80 s compared with the base these results are generally consistent with the climatic projections in a tunisian case study which reported that rainfall would decrease between 10 in the north and 30 in the south in the same period marh 2011 to gain more insight in the predicted precipitation and the expected changes the generated rcp4 5 dataset was analysed and compared with the baseline precipitation period of 1981 2010 to do so first the distribution of the daily amounts of precipitation was computed the cumulative probabilities are shows in fig 5 a fig 5a shows that the probability of a day with rainfall was only 7 for the years 1981 2010 while the probability increases to 16 14 and 14 for the periods 2011 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 respectively the chance of a rainfall event of 2 5 mm or more is 3 1 8 1 5 and 1 9 for the different periods the larger the amount of precipitation the smaller the differences between the periods not only the size of the precipitation events is important so is the number of them for every year considered we counted the number of events classes of precipitation of 10 mm were assumed and the number of events was counted for each class during the four periods considered the results of this simple but effective analysis are shown in fig 5b from this figure it can be seen that during the years 1981 2010 the majority of years had between 30 40 precipitation events during this period there were also years with 0 10 events in the periods with generated data there were no years with less than 30 events during 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 no years occurred with more than 80 the projection results of temperature evapotranspiration and precipitation were used in the whcatch model to estimate the future water availability in each sub catchment the amount of rainfall and the change in temperature directly affected the evapotranspiration values and the water balance terms 3 2 water harvesting model whcatch the whcatch model was used to estimate future water availability for each rwh structure relative to the baseline period the sub catchments and flow directions are shown in fig 6 the amount of water that will be caught by each rwh structure is highly dependent on the amount of precipitation in its sub catchment and on the actual evapotranspiration changes in precipitation and temperature will therefore have a direct impact on the availability of water and on the performance of rwh in general the simulations for each sub catchment for rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 for the 20 s 2011 2040 50 s 2041 2070 and 80 s 2071 2100 are compared with the baseline period 1981 2010 and presented in fig 7 a the volume of water stored in a reservoir depends on the available runoff and the water demand the performance of rwh under current conditions was previously assessed and discussed adham et al 2016b the amount of water stored in each sub catchment decreased under the future conditions in rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 fig 7a the results of whcatch were identical to those for projected precipitation fig 4b about 72 of the sub catchments were able to meet the water requirements in the baseline period for future scenarios about 30 in rcp 2 6 25 in rcp 4 5 in all periods and 50 for rcp 8 5 in 20 s and 50 s will be able to meet the water requirements fig 7a whereas only 25 of the sub catchments for 80 s in the rcp 8 5 able to meet the water requirements zero values of harvested rainwater for the sub catchments however indicated the inability of rwh to meet the water requirements the zero values were due to reasons such as insufficient storage capacity suboptimal height of the spillway direction of streamflow adham et al 2016b the watershed runoff relationship in asars has long been reported the volume of the harvested runoff is directly proportional to the size and length of the runoff harvesting structure adham et al 2018 most of the rwh structures built by farmers in asars are washed away due to the insufficient capacity of spillways adham et al 2016b spillways with sufficient capacity and at the right location must therefore be provided field observations and the analysis of the water balance indicated that most of the runoff flowed in one direction fig 6a adham et al 2016b reported that changing spillway heights together with flow directions substantially increased rainwater availability under current climatic conditions for the proposed rwh solutions compared to the results for traditional designs the analyses with whcatch indicated that changing spillway heights together with flow directions fig 6b for optimising the performance of the rwh structures and improving the yield water availability of the rwh system based on the projected future climatic conditions fig 7b substantially increased the performance of rwh increasing the efficiency of water availability in 92 of all sub catchments in the baseline period in all three rcp scenarios compared to 72 without the changes the efficiency of water availability will be increased almost double in both scenarios rcp 2 6 and 4 5 in all periods compared to the sub catchments without changes whereas the efficiency of water availability will be the same for 80 s in rcp 2 6 moreover about 80 of the sub catchments in the rcp 8 5 in 20 s and 50 s will be able to meet the water requirements compared to 50 without the changes fig 7b and table 3 fig 8b shows that the first four rwh structure sub catchments have no big significant change with this scenario these results are due to a relatively small runoff area in the first three structures whereas the structure was broken in the fourth site and we considered it works as a runoff area harvested rainwater increased in all three rcps table 3 table 3 confirmed that the increasing of the water supply in most sub catchments are more depend on the water management and structure design than climate change scenarios itself 4 conclusions this study demonstrated the feasibility of rainwater harvesting as an adaptive strategy to mitigate water scarcity and to improve water availability now and under changing climatic conditions analysing our generated data showed that both the minimum and maximum temperatures tended to increase and precipitation tended to decrease in all scenarios of future emissions of greenhouse gases in most periods 20 s 50 s and 80 s the increase in temperature yields an increase in potential evapotranspiration as well changing the flow directions combined with increasing the heights of spillways had a large impact on the performance of the rainwater harvesting structures water availability fulfilled the demand in 92 of the sub catchments compared to only 72 without these adaptive measures in all the scenarios of climate change therefore at sub catchments level water management and structure design play a more important role in the performance of rainwater harvesting rather than climate change itself the results could be important for designers decision makers and farmers for adapting to the forthcoming climatic conditions and or for mitigating the adverse impacts of a changing climate on water resources further research however is required to include multiple general circulation models gcms and downscaling models under coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 and to consider changes in land use cover in simulation models to better understand the impact

10989,rainwater harvesting has a crucial role in facilitating supplementary irrigation and groundwater recharge the current research study assesses the socio economic impacts of small rainwater harvesting structures doha models percolation tanks dug along the length of lower order seasonal streams in semi arid jalna district of maharashtra state in india these structures facilitated recharge of wells in the agricultural fields close to streams facilitated by an increased water availability for irrigation cropping intensity cropping diversification and crop yields especially for winter crops requiring assured irrigation on these agricultural fields grew more than on the agricultural fields away from streams high risk commercial seed crop cultivation also increased on the agricultural fields close to streams at two of the four study sites well recharge led to improvement in drinking water supply and also led to a reduction in physical drudgery associated with fetching water ownership and income from livestock also record a growth owing to better water and feed availability for livestock facilitated by rainwater harvesting the cost benefit analysis yields an internal rate of return of 16 for doha models however the study highlights that the benefits from doha models are limited to the agricultural fields which are downstream and are close to streams leaving a large portion of agricultural land also no community institutions are managing these structures based on this analysis the study suggests increasing community participation in the designing and implementation of these structures keywords rainwater harvesting irrigation recharge wells livestock stream digging 1 introduction 1 1 background agriculture is the primary livelihood for a significant indian population and 54 of india s total workforce was engaged in agriculture in 2011 goi 2011 agricultural sector growth in the country shows high volatility due to its dependence on a precarious monsoon goi 2016a to overcome monsoon uncertainties different irrigation sources mostly surface water based have been used across the country however since 1960 61 the use of groundwater for irrigation has gained coin among indian farmers gandhi and bhamoriya 2011 shah 2010 increasing population pressure on agricultural lands due to growing land fractionalisation and a growing number of small and marginal farmers holding agricultural land below 5 acres has led to a gradually increasing dependence on groundwater for irrigation goi 2018 shah 2010 in 2011 12 groundwater was irrigating 63 of the net area under irrigation in india and its share is going to increase further considering the estimated population growth in the country from 1 3 billion in 2017 to 1 66 billion in 2050 goi 2016b united nations 2017 increasing dependence for irrigation has led to growing stress on groundwater evident in the groundwater development beyond annual replenishable capacity in few states in the western and southern part of india cgwb 2017 the indian state of maharashtra has an annual groundwater draft of 54 of its annual replenishment capacity however close to 20 of its geographical area falling under arid and semi arid climatic regions receives less than 800 mm of annual rainfall and is prone to droughts goi 2014 krishnan 1980 few districts from this region have faced severe water crisis over the last decade and resorted to transporting of water from other districts rashid and more 2016 rainwater harvesting is a potential solution to this water scarce situation and a study in seventy villages of maharashtra finds an increase in the groundwater table due to water harvesting structures bouma et al 2016 kerr 2001 different small water harvesting structures across streams have been in traditional use in india agarwal and narain 1997 this research studies the impacts of one such structure named doha model locally developed by dilasa sanstha a non governmental organisation ngo dilasa sanstha 2016 it is a percolation tank like structure dug along the length of lower order seasonal streams which are on the village common lands fig 1 digging of multiple doha models takes place in a series in the stream beds with mud walls retained between every two doha models facilitating groundwater recharge deora 2018 the average depth of a doha model is 3 m from the ground level and the average width is 10 m length of each doha model is 150 200 meters along the length of the stream dilasa sanstha has replicated this intervention in different districts of maharashtra water harvesting structures on streams facilitating groundwater recharge are primarily of two types those diverting the stream water for storage away from the stream and those storing the water along the stream length prinz 1996 sakthivadivel 2007 tanks and ponds from the first category have been found effective however promoting these structures on the privately owned agricultural lands in the stream vicinity is a challenge kumar et al 2016 malik et al 2014 among the second category of structures constructed along the stream length check dams across streams have been widely studied and found to be efficient water harvesting structures owing to their positive impact on the groundwater table and the agricultural production renganayaki and elango 2013 different variants of check dams are used ranging from concrete to loose boulder structures but when used on the lower order streams they are prone to frequent silting balooni et al 2008 padmavathy et al 1993 instead doha model which does not involve any concrete construction is a cheaper alternative and the digging of the portion upstream for this structure also reduces the extent of siltation in the successive years a scientific study of the impacts of this water harvesting structure can help in weighing its benefits vis à vis costs and identify its potential for further replication with this intent the current study carries out a socio economic impact assessment of the doha model this study assesses the impacts of the doha model on agricultural crop production availability of water for domestic use and support for livestock along with other social benefits as recorded during the study it also performs a cost benefit analysis of the intervention 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the study area for the current research study is comprised of four villages from the jalna district of maharashtra akola deo papal shirala and rohanwadi fig 2 jalna district is a part of the deccan plateau with the predominant rocks structures made of volcanic lava flows also known as deccan traps cgwb 2013 it has shallow to deep black basaltic soil an expansive soil swelling and shrinking with a change in the water content in the soil the study area witnesses a semi arid climate receiving a mean annual rainfall in the range of 600 mm and 1000 mm and the predominant natural vegetation in the study area is the dry deciduous forest mandal and gajbhiye 2000 further due to a poor primary porosity of the deccan traps the groundwater occurrence in the study area is mainly because of the secondary porosity acquired by weathering jointing shearing or fracturing of rocks cgwb 2013 the population of the four sample villages akola deo papal shirala and rohanwadi are 3633 1289 1943 and 1238 respectively as per census 2011 goi 2011 agriculture is the primary livelihood in each of these villages as more than 70 of the total working population is engaged in agriculture either as cultivators or as agricultural labourers goi 2011 agriculture traditionally rainfed in the study area have come to depend on groundwater for irrigation with the advent of diesel and electric pumps during the last three decade as indicated by the respondent data it is corroborated by the irrigation scenario for the jalna district as close to 75 of the gross irrigated area is under groundwater irrigation crida 2012 cotton maize soyabean pigeon pea and green gram are the primary monsoon kharif crops in the study area sorghum and wheat the primary winter rabi crops cultivated after harvesting of the relatively shorter duration kharif crops depending upon the residual moisture and supplementary irrigation similar cropping trend is observed across the jalna district crida 2012 the study area had suffered a severe drought in the year 2012 with an average annual rainfall of 324 mm across the jalna district dandekar and thakkar 2013 in response to the water scarce situation doha models were dug in the study area during the years 2013 and 2014 2 2 sampling and data collection the four study villages were selected through purposive sampling using two selection criteria first relatively larger stream length under doha models and second relatively longer time passed since the doha model digging table 1 these two criteria ensure that the study identifies all potential impacts of the doha model over the long haul the sample population for the study consists of 68 farmer households from the four study villages selected through purposive sampling divided into the treatment and the control groups the treatment group consists of 38 households having their agricultural fields closer to streams and the rest 30 households having their agricultural field away from streams form the control group explanation of threshold distance from the stream separating the two groups is in 2 4 1 undulating stream sections around ridges are not considered while selecting sample households because of the undulating nature of agricultural fields agricultural fields around relatively flat stream sections are suitable for comparison across treatment and control group due to similar topography hence relatively flat sections of streams are considered while selecting sample households the study uses a semi structured questionnaire and focus group discussions for data collection the questionnaire has been used to collect data on the socio economic profile of the 68 sample households table 2 along with the details on their agricultural land holding access to irrigation sources water level in the irrigation sources types of crops cultivated crop production expenses and revenue from the crop cultivation livestock ownership and income from livestock the questionnaire has been used to collect data for both the periods before and after doha model digging and the data collection is recall based due to the absence of written records six focus group discussions with 80 people both men and women in four sample villages have been conducted to collect details of the doha model infrastructure in the vicinity and its impact on the stream water retention common drinking water source for the village water availability for livestock and women s physical drudgery focus group discussions also investigated the community s participation in the process of doha model digging and mechanism for maintenance and repair of these structures additionally interviews have been conducted with the members of the implementing organisation to triangulate the data collected using questionnaire and focus group discussions 2 3 analysis the study employs the difference in difference method also known as the double difference method to analyse the impacts of the doha model intervention card and krueger 1993 it involves a comparison of incremental changes across a treatment group and a control group and is widely used for impact evaluation studies the difference in difference method helps in controlling the impact of changes that might happen in the absence of the intervention in the treatment group khandker et al 2009 the study analyses the impacts of doha models on agriculture and water availability for domestic use by comparing changes across the treatment and the control group households for a period of five years from 2013 2018 to establish the impacts on agriculture it analyses changes in cropping intensification crop yield and crop diversification malik et al 2014 changes in crop diversification have been analysed using the herfindahl index of diversification its value ranges from zero to one approaching zero for complete diversification and approaching one for perfect specialisation bradshaw 2004 h n 1 i p i 2 where h herfindahl index of diversification and p i proportion of the i t h crop to the total cropped area impacts on domestic water availability have been established through comparison of changes in water level and water retention in dug wells and borewells across the two groups of households sur et al 2001 additionally any changes in the physical drudgery associated with fetching water for domestic use have also been analysed the study also establishes the impacts of doha models on livestock by analysing changes in the livestock ownership feed and water availability for livestock and income from livestock for the five years of 2013 2018 kumar et al 2016 analysis of the qualitative data collected through focus group discussions and field observations yields information on other social and ecological impacts of the doha models lastly a cost benefit analysis compares incremental benefits from the doha model with the costs incurred to determine the internal rate of return of the investment kumar et al 2016 2 4 assumptions for the analysis 2 4 1 threshold distance from the stream as doha models are dug along the length of the stream falling on the common land their benefits are available to all the agricultural fields in the stream vicinity spreading contiguously from the two stream banks however the groundwater recharge benefits of stream deepening via doha models primarily through induced filtration stay confined to the stream proximity kazmann 1948 also there are no cases of surface water pumping from the stream in the study area therefore to estimate benefits owing to the groundwater recharge and to delineate the treatment and the control group households it is necessary to take a threshold distance from the stream banks separating the two groups however the data collected from households through questionnaires does not reveal a clear distance up to which the recharge benefits are accrued in the absence of a clear distance the study assumes a threshold distance of 200 m on either side of the stream banks 200 m has been perceived as the threashold distance for grounwater recharge by the respondents in the study area and the agency which designed and implemented doha model a study on groundwater recharge in southern india also arrives at a threshold distance of 200 m from an ephemeral stream thus corroborating the assumption maréchal et al 2009 2 4 2 distribution of income and expenditure over entire agricultural land 15 out of 38 surveyed households who have their agricultural fields closer to stream own agricultural land in two non contiguous patches one closer to the stream and another far from the stream also when the entire land is contiguous starting from the stream bank it is stretching beyond the threshold distance of 200 m from the stream bank however these respondents do not maintain separate records of the income and expenditure for their agricultural lands up to 200 m from the stream bank and for the agricultural land beyond this threshold households reported using dug wells from their agricultural fields within 200 m from the stream bank to irrigate their entire agricultural land using pumps therefore considering the impossibility of calculating the income and expenditure separately for agricultural land within 200 m from the stream bank and the information gathered from the respondents this study makes an assumption it assumes that the reported agricultural income and expenditure for the households having their agricultural fields closer to streams are solely due to their agricultural land patches within 200 m from the stream bank 2 4 3 inflation rate it is necessary to assume an inflation rate to conduct a cost benefit analysis of the doha models and this study considers india s consumer price index inflation rate for this purpose khastagir and jayasuriya 2011 the income and expenditure in agriculture are dependent on the prices of agricultural inputs tools irrigation equipment and demand of an agricultural product in the market among other aspects and the consumer price index inflation rate best represents this variety of aspects goi 2015 this study takes an average of annual consumer price index inflation rates for ten years till the year before the study which comes to 8 bureau of statistics 2018 the study takes an average of ten years to mitigate the effects of year on year variations 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact on agriculture this section presents and discusses the impacts of doha models on the crop intensification diversification and the crop yield also discussed are the impacts on commercial seed crop cultivation a practice specific to the study area general agriculture practice in the study area is of cultivating two crops in a year one during the monsoon kharif and other during the winter rabi 67 98 6 of surveyed households have access to at least one irrigation source since before doha model digging irrigation through groundwater is the preferred method with 66 97 of surveyed households having private access to groundwater through dug well or borewell or both depth of these dug wells ranges from 12 m to 22 m from the ground all surveyed households have access to electric or diesel pumps also for extracting water for irrigation 66 97 of the households own electric pumps and pay flat annual electricity tariffs at one study site surface water irrigation is also available through a government canal project 3 1 1 crop intensification after doha model digging average cropping intensity has increased for households having their agricultural fields closer to streams from 129 to 132 during the same period cropping intensity has reduced for households having their agricultural fields away from the stream from 124 to 122 doha models have facilitated groundwater recharge and additional water availability for irrigation which has supported crop intensification however the difference in the average cropping intensities obtained after doha model digging between the two groups of the households having their agricultural fields closer to streams and those having their agricultural fields far from streams is statistically non significant at 5 significance level p 15 one reason for a statistically non significant difference in the cropping intensities is no change in the availability of irrigation sources after doha models digging doha models have not created any new irrigation sources instead they are facilitating additional water availability for irrigation through the same irrigation sources dug wells or borewells therefore the number of crops cultivated over agricultural land is statistically non significant across the two groups of households this insignificant increase in the cropping intensity is at variance with the comparatively larger increase found in other studies on the small water harvesting structures malik et al 2014 sur et al 2001 this difference can be attributed to the direct water lifting from other water harvesting structures such as farm ponds which allows farmers to utlize water to maximize their agricultural income however exclusion of direct water lifting from doha models has significant benefits in terms of groundwater recharge and in preserving the stream as a crucial water source for livestock 3 1 2 increase in crop yield an increase in the crop yield is one of the most commonly recorded indicators of the impact of water harvesting structures bouma et al 2016 therefore this study compares the impact on the crop yield across the two groups of households those having their agricultural fields closer to streams and those having their agricultural fields away from streams responses to the questionnaire indicate that all respondent households cultivate multiple crops during the two crop cycles over a year seven crops occupying more than 10 acres of area in sample households across both the groups of households are part of this analysis table 3 these crops are cotton green gram maize pigeon pea and soyabean are monsoon crops and sorghum and wheat are winter crops after the doha model intervention five out of seven crops exhibit relative higher percentage increase in yield for agricultural fields closer to streams as compared to households having their agricultural fields away from streams however statistical analysis using a t test comparing crop yields after doha model digging across the two groups of households indicates that out of seven crops only for the two winter crops sorghum and wheat the difference in crop yields are statistically significant at 5 significance level with p value 01 and p 02 respectively thus for sorghum and wheat crop yields after doha model digging are significantly higher for the households having their agricultural fields closer to streams as compared to the households having their fields away from streams there is no statistically significant difference between the crop yields after doha model digging for any of the monsoon crops the study also analyses whether the crop yields for sorghum and wheat were not already significantly higher for agricultural fields closer to streams for this the study conducts a t test comparing these crop yields across the two groups of households before the doha model intervention took place for both these crops this difference is non significant at the 5 significance level with p 69 for sorghum and p 91 for wheat thus the increased crop yield for winter crops requiring assured irrigation is attributable to the increased water availability for irrigation a study on the farm ponds finds a similar increase in the yield of irrigated crops malik et al 2014 however as revealed from focus group discussions the additional water availability in the wells has also facilitated irrigation during dry spells reducing risk of crop damage during kharif kumar et al 2016 3 1 3 diversification of crops diversification to high value crops utilising the additional water available through water harvesting structures has been found to result in a definite increase in the net agricultural returns kumar et al 2016 however analysis reveals that the crop diversification has increased only marginally after the doha model digging and it has increased for both the groups of households manifested in a decrease in the value of the herfindahl index of crop diversification the value of the herfindahl index has decreased from 0 35 to 0 29 for households having their agricultural fields closer to streams and from 0 37 to 0 35 for households having their agricultural fields away from streams although crop diversification is higher on the agricultural fields closer to streams as compared to the agricultural fields away from streams the difference between the herfindahl index values across the two groups of households is statistically non significant at 5 significance level p 59 one major reason for this insignificant increase in diversification is growing cultivation of commercial seed crop as discussed in the following section 3 1 4 increase in commercial seed crop cultivation the study area falls in a major commercial seed cultivation zone in india as regular field testing and production of seeds are carried in the jalna district chauhan et al 2016 commercial seed production is a high risk activity considering its requirement of assured timely irrigation and a greenhouse for better results hatirli et al 2006 however as reported by the respondents returns from seed production are also higher as compared to cotton or other traditional crops cultivated in the study area therefore assuming the adoption rate of commercial seed production to be a proxy for the assured water availability for irrigation study analyses seed crop cultivation details due to a large variety of seed crops a comparison of crop yield is not feasible therefore the study compares the change in the agricultural land area under commercial seed production and change in the number of farmers cultivating seed crops across the two groups of households those having their agricultural fields closer to streams and those having their agricultural fields away from streams land area under commercial seed cultivation and the number of cultivating households both record an increase in both the groups of households table 4 however this increment is higher among the households having their agricultural fields closer to streams as compared to those having their agricultural fields away from streams 3 2 impact on water availability for domestic requirements this section presents the impact of the doha model on the wells which are the domestic water sources at all the study sites of the 66 sample households having private access groundwater access 86 households have only dug wells in their fields 2 households have only borewells and 12 households have both dug wells as wells as borewell on their agricultural fields again of these 66 households 65 98 5 have at least one of their groundwater wells dug well or borewell from before doha models digging these 65 households are part of the analysis below 36 households who have their agricultural fields closer to streams and 29 households having their agricultural fields away from streams of the 65 households 17 own perennial dug wells which retain water throughout the year and 46 intermittent wells which dry sometime after the monsoon and are rejuvenated by the next year s monsoon rain 3 2 1 increased water level and water retention in dug wells and borewells water harvesting has been found to help in the recharge of the groundwater table kerr 2001 however due to regular pumping and consequent water level fluctuations within a single day respondents were unable to recall the water levels in their dug wells before doha model digging therefore the study records and analyses changes observed by respondents in the water level and water retention after doha model digging it analyses change in the depth of water level from the ground for perennial dug wells and the duration of water retention in days for intermittent dug wells across the two groups of households table 5 36 97 of the households having their agricultural fields closer to streams reported an increase in the availability of water in their wells after doha model digging even among the households having their agricultural fields away from streams 9 31 of the households whose wells are spread across a distance of up to 1000 m downstream from the stream sections having doha models reported an increase in the groundwater availability in their dug wells and borewells of the 44 sample households across both the groups reporting an increase in the groundwater availability through wells 43 98 attributed it to the rainwater harvesting through doha models this result finds support from other studies on the water harvesting structures over ephemeral and seasonal streams balooni et al 2008 sur et al 2001 however a more detailed hydrogeological study of doha model is required to completely understand its impact on the groundwater 3 2 2 changes in water availability from drinking water sources drinking water security is a primary goal of the waters harvesting works in india smyle et al 2014 therefore it becomes crucial to study the impacts of doha models on the drinking water availability at two study sites papal and shirala surveyed households do not have access to the government water supply system they reported using private irrigation wells situated on their agriculture fields for drinking water supply as well in shirala respondents reported no change in the drinking water supply situation after doha model digging in papal 25 households having their agricultural fields closer to streams reported an increase in water retention in their dug wells by a period of three months these households reported resorting to water tankers before doha model digging two water tankers of 5000 l capacity costing inr 2000 each for each of the 25 households it is not required now and the opportunity cost saved due to the additional water availability in their dug wells comes to inr 1 00 000 at the other two study sites akola deo and rohanwadi government water supply system ensures drinking water supply through a dug well within the village boundary in akola deo the supply well adjoins a stream section with the doha model and respondents here reported a significant increase in the number of pumping hours from this well increasing from one hour to eight hours during peak summer months in rohanwadi the drinking water well is at the bank of a river which is more than 2000 m from the site of doha models and respondents reported no change in the water level of this well after doha model digging 3 2 3 reduced physical drudgery in akola deo and papal respondents perceive that the doha model intervention has led to assured water availability in their wells and as a consequence their physical drudgery related to their fetching water for domestic use has reduced in papal respondents shared that with the assured water availability through their wells after doha model digging several households have installed a dedicated pipeline to supply water directly to their homes 3 3 impact on livestock this section presents the research findings on the change in the livestock ownership income from livestock and the impact on feed and water availability after doha model digging 3 3 1 increase in livestock ownership and income after doha model digging the number of households rearing livestock has increased from five to twelve among the households who have their agricultural fields closer to streams table 6 and respondents have reported improved dairy farming however livestock ownership and maintenance is capital intensive also the respondents shared interest in purchasing only high milk yielding breeds of cows and buffalos this is a reason for the nominal increase in the number of livestock similar observation has been made by another study on farm ponds malik et al 2014 with the introduction of high milk yielding breeds the annual income from selling of milk has increased by inr 3 46 000 net income of inr 50 from each cow buffalo per day for a period of 90 days in papal and akola deo and 365 days in shirala this income increment has been recorded among the households having their agricultural fields closer to the stream it remains unchanged among households having their agricultural fields away from the stream respondents rearing goats reported sporadic additional income from the selling of meat 3 3 2 improvement in feed and water availability water harvesting structures across streams have been beneficial to ensure feed and water availability for livestock renganayaki and elango 2013 sur et al 2001 similar findings were reported in the current study also respondents reported the use of sorghum primarily as a livestock feed by a significant fraction of households in the study area and the analysis on crop yield suggests that after the doha model digging crop yield of sorghum has increased significantly for the households who have their agricultural fields closer to streams consequently livestock feed availability has also increased at all four study sites respondents reported streams as a primary drinking water source for the livestock population after the doha model digging an increase in water retention has also been reported in the streams by varying durations three months in akola deo two months in papal and four months in rohanwadi and shirala this increased water retention directly relates to additional drinking water availability for the livestock population 3 4 cost benefit analysis the study calculates the internal rate of return irr for doha model by comapring the cost of its digging in the stream bed and the incremental expenditures incurred in agriculture with the incremental agricultural income and the opportunity cost saved due to the additional water availability for domestic use after the doha model intervention due to their location on the common land and the absence of direct water lifting from doha models it is not possible to compare its cost directly with the benefits to individual households or individual crops therefore the study computes aggregated agricultural costs and benefits for all the households along the total stream langth having doha models by extrapolating the costs and benefits accrued to the sample households the households having their agricultural fields closer to the stream the analysis considers 28 households from three of the four sample villages akola deo papal and shirala in which the respondents have their agricultural fields in close proximity to one another and also evenly spread out across both sides of the streams with doha models thus making it feasible to accurately estimate the costs and benefits for the entire stream length it leaves out one village rohanwadi because here the agricultural fields of the respondents are sparsely distributed across multiple streams with doha models and an accurate extrapolation is not feasible one stream from akola deo has also been excluded due to a significant aberration of the size of its doha models from their standard dimensions the analysis does not include costs and benefits related to livestock due to insufficient data for estimating the ownership of livestock animals over the selected stream length at the three study sites the 28 households selected for the analysis have their agricultural fields in the vicinity of three streams the cumulative stream leangth for the three streams over which doha models have been constructed is 4500 ms and the total agricultural land within 200 m from the stream banks over this stream length is 444 8 acres owned by 115 farmers the cost of the doha model digging has been calculated over the 4500 m stream length considering its standard dimesnions as 200 m 10 m 3 m and a unit cost of inr 50 per cubic meter which was employed by the implementing agency the cost benefit analysis calculates the incremental costs and incremetnal benefits for the entire 444 8 acres of land by extrapolating the corresponding costs and benefits for the 28 households incremental costs for agriculture refer to the one time capital expenditures made by the households after the doha model digging which are spread over multiple crops these include the cost of installation of the micro irrigation systems drip sprinkler and pipelines and the cost of installation of the protective net sheds incremental benefits from agriculture have been calculated by subtracting the net annual profits the difference between the annual revenue and the annual expenditure for all the crops before the doha model digging from the net annual profits after the doha model digging the saved opportunity cost due to the additional water availability is inr 1 00 000 as calculated in 3 2 2 the analysis assumes the life of the intervention as five years and calculates costs and benefits for these five years as the years of intervention are 2013 and 2014 and the year of study is 2018 analysis calculates both costs and benefits at 2013 prices using an annual inflation rate of 8 the cost benefit analysis yields an irr of 16 table 7 the irr value for doha models is comparable with that of the other small water harvesting structures assuming a much lesser life kumar et al 2016 panigrahi et al 2005 srivastava et al 2009 periodic investments in their maintenance can make doha models more efficient and sustainable 3 5 constraints results highlight one major limitation associated with doha models the impacts of doha models are limited to agricultural fields in the vicinity of streams and on lowland leaving agricultural fields upstream and away from streams except for the nine households having their agricultural fields beyond 200 m from streams who reported an increase in the water level of their wells others have not reported any benefits doha models respondents perceive that wells that are upstream have received no benefits from doha models and reported that upstream regions do not have doha models conflicts between the upstream farmers and the downstream farmers were also observed during focus group discussions however this conflict is different from the upstream downstream conflict caused by a decreased water availability downstream found in the literature kumar et al 2008 a basin level study is necessary to identify such a conflict accurately and to study the impacts of doha models on the scale of a watershed which will also aid in their replication kumar et al 2016 smyle et al 2014 respondents also reported the absence of any community level institution which has been identified crucial for managing the use of doha models and carrying out periodic maintenance operations such as desilting darghouth et al 2008 glendenning et al 2012 participation of the farming households in the process of design and implementation of water harvesting structures will have a positive impact on water resources efficiently and equity in benefit distribution oweis and hachum 2006 wani et al 2003 the current study also has certain limitations owning to the methodology adopted and the assumptions made for the analysis reliance on the memory recall of respondents affects the reliability of the data collected however by dividing the total sample households into two groups treatment and control the study has attempted to overcome this gap also the study results are specific to a particular agro climatic and agro ecological zone similar studies across different ago climatic and agro ecological zones will further address the gap in the literature a hydrogeological analysis of the groundwater recharge due to doha models is another gap which needs to be addressed through further studies 4 conclusion rainwater harvesting through doha models has helped farmers in increasing their agricultural cropping intensity crop diversification crop yield for the majority of crops specifically winter rabi crops requiring assured irrigation and area under high risk high return commercial seed cultivation on the agricultural fields in the stream vicinity water level as well as water retention has increased in dug wells and borewells on agricultural fields closer to streams and also for wells away from streams which are downstream drinking water supply has improved and physical drudgery involved in fetching water for domestic use has reduced livestock rearing has also received a push after doha model digging through an increase in numbers and additional feed and water availability for livestock a cost benefit analysis comparing incremental costs of doha model digging and other capital costs incurred by households related to agriculture with incremental benefits after doha models gives an irr of 16 the study highlights the need to promote local community s participation in the design and implementation of the water harvesting intervention for greater equity in its benefit distribution it also highlights the need to investigate the impacts of doha models at the watershed scale and across different agro climatic and agro ecological zones for a greater understanding of their impacts and an impactful replication lastly the need for a hydrogeological study of the impacts has also been emphasised thus this study opens up a scope for future research studies exploring similar locally developed small water harvesting structures this research brings in crucial insights for decision makers by highlighting the impacts of a low cost small water harvesting structure in a low rainfall area no requirement of land acquisition makes it even more useful for

10989,rainwater harvesting has a crucial role in facilitating supplementary irrigation and groundwater recharge the current research study assesses the socio economic impacts of small rainwater harvesting structures doha models percolation tanks dug along the length of lower order seasonal streams in semi arid jalna district of maharashtra state in india these structures facilitated recharge of wells in the agricultural fields close to streams facilitated by an increased water availability for irrigation cropping intensity cropping diversification and crop yields especially for winter crops requiring assured irrigation on these agricultural fields grew more than on the agricultural fields away from streams high risk commercial seed crop cultivation also increased on the agricultural fields close to streams at two of the four study sites well recharge led to improvement in drinking water supply and also led to a reduction in physical drudgery associated with fetching water ownership and income from livestock also record a growth owing to better water and feed availability for livestock facilitated by rainwater harvesting the cost benefit analysis yields an internal rate of return of 16 for doha models however the study highlights that the benefits from doha models are limited to the agricultural fields which are downstream and are close to streams leaving a large portion of agricultural land also no community institutions are managing these structures based on this analysis the study suggests increasing community participation in the designing and implementation of these structures keywords rainwater harvesting irrigation recharge wells livestock stream digging 1 introduction 1 1 background agriculture is the primary livelihood for a significant indian population and 54 of india s total workforce was engaged in agriculture in 2011 goi 2011 agricultural sector growth in the country shows high volatility due to its dependence on a precarious monsoon goi 2016a to overcome monsoon uncertainties different irrigation sources mostly surface water based have been used across the country however since 1960 61 the use of groundwater for irrigation has gained coin among indian farmers gandhi and bhamoriya 2011 shah 2010 increasing population pressure on agricultural lands due to growing land fractionalisation and a growing number of small and marginal farmers holding agricultural land below 5 acres has led to a gradually increasing dependence on groundwater for irrigation goi 2018 shah 2010 in 2011 12 groundwater was irrigating 63 of the net area under irrigation in india and its share is going to increase further considering the estimated population growth in the country from 1 3 billion in 2017 to 1 66 billion in 2050 goi 2016b united nations 2017 increasing dependence for irrigation has led to growing stress on groundwater evident in the groundwater development beyond annual replenishable capacity in few states in the western and southern part of india cgwb 2017 the indian state of maharashtra has an annual groundwater draft of 54 of its annual replenishment capacity however close to 20 of its geographical area falling under arid and semi arid climatic regions receives less than 800 mm of annual rainfall and is prone to droughts goi 2014 krishnan 1980 few districts from this region have faced severe water crisis over the last decade and resorted to transporting of water from other districts rashid and more 2016 rainwater harvesting is a potential solution to this water scarce situation and a study in seventy villages of maharashtra finds an increase in the groundwater table due to water harvesting structures bouma et al 2016 kerr 2001 different small water harvesting structures across streams have been in traditional use in india agarwal and narain 1997 this research studies the impacts of one such structure named doha model locally developed by dilasa sanstha a non governmental organisation ngo dilasa sanstha 2016 it is a percolation tank like structure dug along the length of lower order seasonal streams which are on the village common lands fig 1 digging of multiple doha models takes place in a series in the stream beds with mud walls retained between every two doha models facilitating groundwater recharge deora 2018 the average depth of a doha model is 3 m from the ground level and the average width is 10 m length of each doha model is 150 200 meters along the length of the stream dilasa sanstha has replicated this intervention in different districts of maharashtra water harvesting structures on streams facilitating groundwater recharge are primarily of two types those diverting the stream water for storage away from the stream and those storing the water along the stream length prinz 1996 sakthivadivel 2007 tanks and ponds from the first category have been found effective however promoting these structures on the privately owned agricultural lands in the stream vicinity is a challenge kumar et al 2016 malik et al 2014 among the second category of structures constructed along the stream length check dams across streams have been widely studied and found to be efficient water harvesting structures owing to their positive impact on the groundwater table and the agricultural production renganayaki and elango 2013 different variants of check dams are used ranging from concrete to loose boulder structures but when used on the lower order streams they are prone to frequent silting balooni et al 2008 padmavathy et al 1993 instead doha model which does not involve any concrete construction is a cheaper alternative and the digging of the portion upstream for this structure also reduces the extent of siltation in the successive years a scientific study of the impacts of this water harvesting structure can help in weighing its benefits vis à vis costs and identify its potential for further replication with this intent the current study carries out a socio economic impact assessment of the doha model this study assesses the impacts of the doha model on agricultural crop production availability of water for domestic use and support for livestock along with other social benefits as recorded during the study it also performs a cost benefit analysis of the intervention 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the study area for the current research study is comprised of four villages from the jalna district of maharashtra akola deo papal shirala and rohanwadi fig 2 jalna district is a part of the deccan plateau with the predominant rocks structures made of volcanic lava flows also known as deccan traps cgwb 2013 it has shallow to deep black basaltic soil an expansive soil swelling and shrinking with a change in the water content in the soil the study area witnesses a semi arid climate receiving a mean annual rainfall in the range of 600 mm and 1000 mm and the predominant natural vegetation in the study area is the dry deciduous forest mandal and gajbhiye 2000 further due to a poor primary porosity of the deccan traps the groundwater occurrence in the study area is mainly because of the secondary porosity acquired by weathering jointing shearing or fracturing of rocks cgwb 2013 the population of the four sample villages akola deo papal shirala and rohanwadi are 3633 1289 1943 and 1238 respectively as per census 2011 goi 2011 agriculture is the primary livelihood in each of these villages as more than 70 of the total working population is engaged in agriculture either as cultivators or as agricultural labourers goi 2011 agriculture traditionally rainfed in the study area have come to depend on groundwater for irrigation with the advent of diesel and electric pumps during the last three decade as indicated by the respondent data it is corroborated by the irrigation scenario for the jalna district as close to 75 of the gross irrigated area is under groundwater irrigation crida 2012 cotton maize soyabean pigeon pea and green gram are the primary monsoon kharif crops in the study area sorghum and wheat the primary winter rabi crops cultivated after harvesting of the relatively shorter duration kharif crops depending upon the residual moisture and supplementary irrigation similar cropping trend is observed across the jalna district crida 2012 the study area had suffered a severe drought in the year 2012 with an average annual rainfall of 324 mm across the jalna district dandekar and thakkar 2013 in response to the water scarce situation doha models were dug in the study area during the years 2013 and 2014 2 2 sampling and data collection the four study villages were selected through purposive sampling using two selection criteria first relatively larger stream length under doha models and second relatively longer time passed since the doha model digging table 1 these two criteria ensure that the study identifies all potential impacts of the doha model over the long haul the sample population for the study consists of 68 farmer households from the four study villages selected through purposive sampling divided into the treatment and the control groups the treatment group consists of 38 households having their agricultural fields closer to streams and the rest 30 households having their agricultural field away from streams form the control group explanation of threshold distance from the stream separating the two groups is in 2 4 1 undulating stream sections around ridges are not considered while selecting sample households because of the undulating nature of agricultural fields agricultural fields around relatively flat stream sections are suitable for comparison across treatment and control group due to similar topography hence relatively flat sections of streams are considered while selecting sample households the study uses a semi structured questionnaire and focus group discussions for data collection the questionnaire has been used to collect data on the socio economic profile of the 68 sample households table 2 along with the details on their agricultural land holding access to irrigation sources water level in the irrigation sources types of crops cultivated crop production expenses and revenue from the crop cultivation livestock ownership and income from livestock the questionnaire has been used to collect data for both the periods before and after doha model digging and the data collection is recall based due to the absence of written records six focus group discussions with 80 people both men and women in four sample villages have been conducted to collect details of the doha model infrastructure in the vicinity and its impact on the stream water retention common drinking water source for the village water availability for livestock and women s physical drudgery focus group discussions also investigated the community s participation in the process of doha model digging and mechanism for maintenance and repair of these structures additionally interviews have been conducted with the members of the implementing organisation to triangulate the data collected using questionnaire and focus group discussions 2 3 analysis the study employs the difference in difference method also known as the double difference method to analyse the impacts of the doha model intervention card and krueger 1993 it involves a comparison of incremental changes across a treatment group and a control group and is widely used for impact evaluation studies the difference in difference method helps in controlling the impact of changes that might happen in the absence of the intervention in the treatment group khandker et al 2009 the study analyses the impacts of doha models on agriculture and water availability for domestic use by comparing changes across the treatment and the control group households for a period of five years from 2013 2018 to establish the impacts on agriculture it analyses changes in cropping intensification crop yield and crop diversification malik et al 2014 changes in crop diversification have been analysed using the herfindahl index of diversification its value ranges from zero to one approaching zero for complete diversification and approaching one for perfect specialisation bradshaw 2004 h n 1 i p i 2 where h herfindahl index of diversification and p i proportion of the i t h crop to the total cropped area impacts on domestic water availability have been established through comparison of changes in water level and water retention in dug wells and borewells across the two groups of households sur et al 2001 additionally any changes in the physical drudgery associated with fetching water for domestic use have also been analysed the study also establishes the impacts of doha models on livestock by analysing changes in the livestock ownership feed and water availability for livestock and income from livestock for the five years of 2013 2018 kumar et al 2016 analysis of the qualitative data collected through focus group discussions and field observations yields information on other social and ecological impacts of the doha models lastly a cost benefit analysis compares incremental benefits from the doha model with the costs incurred to determine the internal rate of return of the investment kumar et al 2016 2 4 assumptions for the analysis 2 4 1 threshold distance from the stream as doha models are dug along the length of the stream falling on the common land their benefits are available to all the agricultural fields in the stream vicinity spreading contiguously from the two stream banks however the groundwater recharge benefits of stream deepening via doha models primarily through induced filtration stay confined to the stream proximity kazmann 1948 also there are no cases of surface water pumping from the stream in the study area therefore to estimate benefits owing to the groundwater recharge and to delineate the treatment and the control group households it is necessary to take a threshold distance from the stream banks separating the two groups however the data collected from households through questionnaires does not reveal a clear distance up to which the recharge benefits are accrued in the absence of a clear distance the study assumes a threshold distance of 200 m on either side of the stream banks 200 m has been perceived as the threashold distance for grounwater recharge by the respondents in the study area and the agency which designed and implemented doha model a study on groundwater recharge in southern india also arrives at a threshold distance of 200 m from an ephemeral stream thus corroborating the assumption maréchal et al 2009 2 4 2 distribution of income and expenditure over entire agricultural land 15 out of 38 surveyed households who have their agricultural fields closer to stream own agricultural land in two non contiguous patches one closer to the stream and another far from the stream also when the entire land is contiguous starting from the stream bank it is stretching beyond the threshold distance of 200 m from the stream bank however these respondents do not maintain separate records of the income and expenditure for their agricultural lands up to 200 m from the stream bank and for the agricultural land beyond this threshold households reported using dug wells from their agricultural fields within 200 m from the stream bank to irrigate their entire agricultural land using pumps therefore considering the impossibility of calculating the income and expenditure separately for agricultural land within 200 m from the stream bank and the information gathered from the respondents this study makes an assumption it assumes that the reported agricultural income and expenditure for the households having their agricultural fields closer to streams are solely due to their agricultural land patches within 200 m from the stream bank 2 4 3 inflation rate it is necessary to assume an inflation rate to conduct a cost benefit analysis of the doha models and this study considers india s consumer price index inflation rate for this purpose khastagir and jayasuriya 2011 the income and expenditure in agriculture are dependent on the prices of agricultural inputs tools irrigation equipment and demand of an agricultural product in the market among other aspects and the consumer price index inflation rate best represents this variety of aspects goi 2015 this study takes an average of annual consumer price index inflation rates for ten years till the year before the study which comes to 8 bureau of statistics 2018 the study takes an average of ten years to mitigate the effects of year on year variations 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact on agriculture this section presents and discusses the impacts of doha models on the crop intensification diversification and the crop yield also discussed are the impacts on commercial seed crop cultivation a practice specific to the study area general agriculture practice in the study area is of cultivating two crops in a year one during the monsoon kharif and other during the winter rabi 67 98 6 of surveyed households have access to at least one irrigation source since before doha model digging irrigation through groundwater is the preferred method with 66 97 of surveyed households having private access to groundwater through dug well or borewell or both depth of these dug wells ranges from 12 m to 22 m from the ground all surveyed households have access to electric or diesel pumps also for extracting water for irrigation 66 97 of the households own electric pumps and pay flat annual electricity tariffs at one study site surface water irrigation is also available through a government canal project 3 1 1 crop intensification after doha model digging average cropping intensity has increased for households having their agricultural fields closer to streams from 129 to 132 during the same period cropping intensity has reduced for households having their agricultural fields away from the stream from 124 to 122 doha models have facilitated groundwater recharge and additional water availability for irrigation which has supported crop intensification however the difference in the average cropping intensities obtained after doha model digging between the two groups of the households having their agricultural fields closer to streams and those having their agricultural fields far from streams is statistically non significant at 5 significance level p 15 one reason for a statistically non significant difference in the cropping intensities is no change in the availability of irrigation sources after doha models digging doha models have not created any new irrigation sources instead they are facilitating additional water availability for irrigation through the same irrigation sources dug wells or borewells therefore the number of crops cultivated over agricultural land is statistically non significant across the two groups of households this insignificant increase in the cropping intensity is at variance with the comparatively larger increase found in other studies on the small water harvesting structures malik et al 2014 sur et al 2001 this difference can be attributed to the direct water lifting from other water harvesting structures such as farm ponds which allows farmers to utlize water to maximize their agricultural income however exclusion of direct water lifting from doha models has significant benefits in terms of groundwater recharge and in preserving the stream as a crucial water source for livestock 3 1 2 increase in crop yield an increase in the crop yield is one of the most commonly recorded indicators of the impact of water harvesting structures bouma et al 2016 therefore this study compares the impact on the crop yield across the two groups of households those having their agricultural fields closer to streams and those having their agricultural fields away from streams responses to the questionnaire indicate that all respondent households cultivate multiple crops during the two crop cycles over a year seven crops occupying more than 10 acres of area in sample households across both the groups of households are part of this analysis table 3 these crops are cotton green gram maize pigeon pea and soyabean are monsoon crops and sorghum and wheat are winter crops after the doha model intervention five out of seven crops exhibit relative higher percentage increase in yield for agricultural fields closer to streams as compared to households having their agricultural fields away from streams however statistical analysis using a t test comparing crop yields after doha model digging across the two groups of households indicates that out of seven crops only for the two winter crops sorghum and wheat the difference in crop yields are statistically significant at 5 significance level with p value 01 and p 02 respectively thus for sorghum and wheat crop yields after doha model digging are significantly higher for the households having their agricultural fields closer to streams as compared to the households having their fields away from streams there is no statistically significant difference between the crop yields after doha model digging for any of the monsoon crops the study also analyses whether the crop yields for sorghum and wheat were not already significantly higher for agricultural fields closer to streams for this the study conducts a t test comparing these crop yields across the two groups of households before the doha model intervention took place for both these crops this difference is non significant at the 5 significance level with p 69 for sorghum and p 91 for wheat thus the increased crop yield for winter crops requiring assured irrigation is attributable to the increased water availability for irrigation a study on the farm ponds finds a similar increase in the yield of irrigated crops malik et al 2014 however as revealed from focus group discussions the additional water availability in the wells has also facilitated irrigation during dry spells reducing risk of crop damage during kharif kumar et al 2016 3 1 3 diversification of crops diversification to high value crops utilising the additional water available through water harvesting structures has been found to result in a definite increase in the net agricultural returns kumar et al 2016 however analysis reveals that the crop diversification has increased only marginally after the doha model digging and it has increased for both the groups of households manifested in a decrease in the value of the herfindahl index of crop diversification the value of the herfindahl index has decreased from 0 35 to 0 29 for households having their agricultural fields closer to streams and from 0 37 to 0 35 for households having their agricultural fields away from streams although crop diversification is higher on the agricultural fields closer to streams as compared to the agricultural fields away from streams the difference between the herfindahl index values across the two groups of households is statistically non significant at 5 significance level p 59 one major reason for this insignificant increase in diversification is growing cultivation of commercial seed crop as discussed in the following section 3 1 4 increase in commercial seed crop cultivation the study area falls in a major commercial seed cultivation zone in india as regular field testing and production of seeds are carried in the jalna district chauhan et al 2016 commercial seed production is a high risk activity considering its requirement of assured timely irrigation and a greenhouse for better results hatirli et al 2006 however as reported by the respondents returns from seed production are also higher as compared to cotton or other traditional crops cultivated in the study area therefore assuming the adoption rate of commercial seed production to be a proxy for the assured water availability for irrigation study analyses seed crop cultivation details due to a large variety of seed crops a comparison of crop yield is not feasible therefore the study compares the change in the agricultural land area under commercial seed production and change in the number of farmers cultivating seed crops across the two groups of households those having their agricultural fields closer to streams and those having their agricultural fields away from streams land area under commercial seed cultivation and the number of cultivating households both record an increase in both the groups of households table 4 however this increment is higher among the households having their agricultural fields closer to streams as compared to those having their agricultural fields away from streams 3 2 impact on water availability for domestic requirements this section presents the impact of the doha model on the wells which are the domestic water sources at all the study sites of the 66 sample households having private access groundwater access 86 households have only dug wells in their fields 2 households have only borewells and 12 households have both dug wells as wells as borewell on their agricultural fields again of these 66 households 65 98 5 have at least one of their groundwater wells dug well or borewell from before doha models digging these 65 households are part of the analysis below 36 households who have their agricultural fields closer to streams and 29 households having their agricultural fields away from streams of the 65 households 17 own perennial dug wells which retain water throughout the year and 46 intermittent wells which dry sometime after the monsoon and are rejuvenated by the next year s monsoon rain 3 2 1 increased water level and water retention in dug wells and borewells water harvesting has been found to help in the recharge of the groundwater table kerr 2001 however due to regular pumping and consequent water level fluctuations within a single day respondents were unable to recall the water levels in their dug wells before doha model digging therefore the study records and analyses changes observed by respondents in the water level and water retention after doha model digging it analyses change in the depth of water level from the ground for perennial dug wells and the duration of water retention in days for intermittent dug wells across the two groups of households table 5 36 97 of the households having their agricultural fields closer to streams reported an increase in the availability of water in their wells after doha model digging even among the households having their agricultural fields away from streams 9 31 of the households whose wells are spread across a distance of up to 1000 m downstream from the stream sections having doha models reported an increase in the groundwater availability in their dug wells and borewells of the 44 sample households across both the groups reporting an increase in the groundwater availability through wells 43 98 attributed it to the rainwater harvesting through doha models this result finds support from other studies on the water harvesting structures over ephemeral and seasonal streams balooni et al 2008 sur et al 2001 however a more detailed hydrogeological study of doha model is required to completely understand its impact on the groundwater 3 2 2 changes in water availability from drinking water sources drinking water security is a primary goal of the waters harvesting works in india smyle et al 2014 therefore it becomes crucial to study the impacts of doha models on the drinking water availability at two study sites papal and shirala surveyed households do not have access to the government water supply system they reported using private irrigation wells situated on their agriculture fields for drinking water supply as well in shirala respondents reported no change in the drinking water supply situation after doha model digging in papal 25 households having their agricultural fields closer to streams reported an increase in water retention in their dug wells by a period of three months these households reported resorting to water tankers before doha model digging two water tankers of 5000 l capacity costing inr 2000 each for each of the 25 households it is not required now and the opportunity cost saved due to the additional water availability in their dug wells comes to inr 1 00 000 at the other two study sites akola deo and rohanwadi government water supply system ensures drinking water supply through a dug well within the village boundary in akola deo the supply well adjoins a stream section with the doha model and respondents here reported a significant increase in the number of pumping hours from this well increasing from one hour to eight hours during peak summer months in rohanwadi the drinking water well is at the bank of a river which is more than 2000 m from the site of doha models and respondents reported no change in the water level of this well after doha model digging 3 2 3 reduced physical drudgery in akola deo and papal respondents perceive that the doha model intervention has led to assured water availability in their wells and as a consequence their physical drudgery related to their fetching water for domestic use has reduced in papal respondents shared that with the assured water availability through their wells after doha model digging several households have installed a dedicated pipeline to supply water directly to their homes 3 3 impact on livestock this section presents the research findings on the change in the livestock ownership income from livestock and the impact on feed and water availability after doha model digging 3 3 1 increase in livestock ownership and income after doha model digging the number of households rearing livestock has increased from five to twelve among the households who have their agricultural fields closer to streams table 6 and respondents have reported improved dairy farming however livestock ownership and maintenance is capital intensive also the respondents shared interest in purchasing only high milk yielding breeds of cows and buffalos this is a reason for the nominal increase in the number of livestock similar observation has been made by another study on farm ponds malik et al 2014 with the introduction of high milk yielding breeds the annual income from selling of milk has increased by inr 3 46 000 net income of inr 50 from each cow buffalo per day for a period of 90 days in papal and akola deo and 365 days in shirala this income increment has been recorded among the households having their agricultural fields closer to the stream it remains unchanged among households having their agricultural fields away from the stream respondents rearing goats reported sporadic additional income from the selling of meat 3 3 2 improvement in feed and water availability water harvesting structures across streams have been beneficial to ensure feed and water availability for livestock renganayaki and elango 2013 sur et al 2001 similar findings were reported in the current study also respondents reported the use of sorghum primarily as a livestock feed by a significant fraction of households in the study area and the analysis on crop yield suggests that after the doha model digging crop yield of sorghum has increased significantly for the households who have their agricultural fields closer to streams consequently livestock feed availability has also increased at all four study sites respondents reported streams as a primary drinking water source for the livestock population after the doha model digging an increase in water retention has also been reported in the streams by varying durations three months in akola deo two months in papal and four months in rohanwadi and shirala this increased water retention directly relates to additional drinking water availability for the livestock population 3 4 cost benefit analysis the study calculates the internal rate of return irr for doha model by comapring the cost of its digging in the stream bed and the incremental expenditures incurred in agriculture with the incremental agricultural income and the opportunity cost saved due to the additional water availability for domestic use after the doha model intervention due to their location on the common land and the absence of direct water lifting from doha models it is not possible to compare its cost directly with the benefits to individual households or individual crops therefore the study computes aggregated agricultural costs and benefits for all the households along the total stream langth having doha models by extrapolating the costs and benefits accrued to the sample households the households having their agricultural fields closer to the stream the analysis considers 28 households from three of the four sample villages akola deo papal and shirala in which the respondents have their agricultural fields in close proximity to one another and also evenly spread out across both sides of the streams with doha models thus making it feasible to accurately estimate the costs and benefits for the entire stream length it leaves out one village rohanwadi because here the agricultural fields of the respondents are sparsely distributed across multiple streams with doha models and an accurate extrapolation is not feasible one stream from akola deo has also been excluded due to a significant aberration of the size of its doha models from their standard dimensions the analysis does not include costs and benefits related to livestock due to insufficient data for estimating the ownership of livestock animals over the selected stream length at the three study sites the 28 households selected for the analysis have their agricultural fields in the vicinity of three streams the cumulative stream leangth for the three streams over which doha models have been constructed is 4500 ms and the total agricultural land within 200 m from the stream banks over this stream length is 444 8 acres owned by 115 farmers the cost of the doha model digging has been calculated over the 4500 m stream length considering its standard dimesnions as 200 m 10 m 3 m and a unit cost of inr 50 per cubic meter which was employed by the implementing agency the cost benefit analysis calculates the incremental costs and incremetnal benefits for the entire 444 8 acres of land by extrapolating the corresponding costs and benefits for the 28 households incremental costs for agriculture refer to the one time capital expenditures made by the households after the doha model digging which are spread over multiple crops these include the cost of installation of the micro irrigation systems drip sprinkler and pipelines and the cost of installation of the protective net sheds incremental benefits from agriculture have been calculated by subtracting the net annual profits the difference between the annual revenue and the annual expenditure for all the crops before the doha model digging from the net annual profits after the doha model digging the saved opportunity cost due to the additional water availability is inr 1 00 000 as calculated in 3 2 2 the analysis assumes the life of the intervention as five years and calculates costs and benefits for these five years as the years of intervention are 2013 and 2014 and the year of study is 2018 analysis calculates both costs and benefits at 2013 prices using an annual inflation rate of 8 the cost benefit analysis yields an irr of 16 table 7 the irr value for doha models is comparable with that of the other small water harvesting structures assuming a much lesser life kumar et al 2016 panigrahi et al 2005 srivastava et al 2009 periodic investments in their maintenance can make doha models more efficient and sustainable 3 5 constraints results highlight one major limitation associated with doha models the impacts of doha models are limited to agricultural fields in the vicinity of streams and on lowland leaving agricultural fields upstream and away from streams except for the nine households having their agricultural fields beyond 200 m from streams who reported an increase in the water level of their wells others have not reported any benefits doha models respondents perceive that wells that are upstream have received no benefits from doha models and reported that upstream regions do not have doha models conflicts between the upstream farmers and the downstream farmers were also observed during focus group discussions however this conflict is different from the upstream downstream conflict caused by a decreased water availability downstream found in the literature kumar et al 2008 a basin level study is necessary to identify such a conflict accurately and to study the impacts of doha models on the scale of a watershed which will also aid in their replication kumar et al 2016 smyle et al 2014 respondents also reported the absence of any community level institution which has been identified crucial for managing the use of doha models and carrying out periodic maintenance operations such as desilting darghouth et al 2008 glendenning et al 2012 participation of the farming households in the process of design and implementation of water harvesting structures will have a positive impact on water resources efficiently and equity in benefit distribution oweis and hachum 2006 wani et al 2003 the current study also has certain limitations owning to the methodology adopted and the assumptions made for the analysis reliance on the memory recall of respondents affects the reliability of the data collected however by dividing the total sample households into two groups treatment and control the study has attempted to overcome this gap also the study results are specific to a particular agro climatic and agro ecological zone similar studies across different ago climatic and agro ecological zones will further address the gap in the literature a hydrogeological analysis of the groundwater recharge due to doha models is another gap which needs to be addressed through further studies 4 conclusion rainwater harvesting through doha models has helped farmers in increasing their agricultural cropping intensity crop diversification crop yield for the majority of crops specifically winter rabi crops requiring assured irrigation and area under high risk high return commercial seed cultivation on the agricultural fields in the stream vicinity water level as well as water retention has increased in dug wells and borewells on agricultural fields closer to streams and also for wells away from streams which are downstream drinking water supply has improved and physical drudgery involved in fetching water for domestic use has reduced livestock rearing has also received a push after doha model digging through an increase in numbers and additional feed and water availability for livestock a cost benefit analysis comparing incremental costs of doha model digging and other capital costs incurred by households related to agriculture with incremental benefits after doha models gives an irr of 16 the study highlights the need to promote local community s participation in the design and implementation of the water harvesting intervention for greater equity in its benefit distribution it also highlights the need to investigate the impacts of doha models at the watershed scale and across different agro climatic and agro ecological zones for a greater understanding of their impacts and an impactful replication lastly the need for a hydrogeological study of the impacts has also been emphasised thus this study opens up a scope for future research studies exploring similar locally developed small water harvesting structures this research brings in crucial insights for decision makers by highlighting the impacts of a low cost small water harvesting structure in a low rainfall area no requirement of land acquisition makes it even more useful for areas with smaller agricultural land holdings declaration of interests none acknowledgement this work was supported by a block grant from the tata trusts mumbai tata trusts had no role whatsoever in
