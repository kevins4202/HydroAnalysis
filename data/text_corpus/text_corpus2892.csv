pyrrolidone nmp merck were utilized as the solvents for the preparation of the dope solutions bovine serum albumin bsa and polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp mw 29 000 g mol were acquired from merck 2 2 fabrication of pes mmms the asymmetric ﬂat sheet membranes and mmms were fabricated using the nips technique 28 29 precise quantities of tio2 sio2 mwcnts cooh mwcnts oh or clay as well as 1 wt of pvp based on polymer mass were added into the either dmac or nmp to get homogeneous dispersions the resultant solutions were subjected to the sonication for 30 min next 15 or 18 wt of pes were added into the solutions and dissolved by constant stirring at ambient temperature for 24 h subsequently the resultant solutions were degassed before casting using a sonicator for 30 min next the degassed solutions were sprinkled on a glass plate for casting by means of an adjustable casting knife elcometer 3580 where the gap is fixed at 150 μm the as cast polymeric films were then immersed in a deionized water di water coagulation bath at 25 c afterward the membranes were transferred to a fresh di water bath for 24 h in order to remove any residual solvent and complete the phase separation the membranes were kept in water for further tests table 1 tabulates the compositions of the prepared membranes 2 3 membrane characterizations a scanning electron microscope sem vega tescan czech republic was utilized to explore the cross sectional and surface morphologies of the prepared membranes the sem was employed under a high vacuum condition at 20 kv the freeze dried membranes were first immersed in liquid nitrogen fractured and then sputter coated with a thin layer of gold to diminish the sample charge images of 3 μl di water droplets on the membrane surface were taken by a contact angle measurement instrument dsa100 krüss germany at 25 c and a relative humidity of 50 di water as the probe liquid was utilized to explore the fabricated membranes surface hydrophilicity more than six images at various places on the membrane surface were taken to get the average contact angles 2 4 pure water flux pwf and separation experiments fig 1 illustrates the scheme of permeation setup used in this study membranes with the effective filtration area of 19 6 cm2 were fixed at the bottom of the dead end permeation cell pure water or bsa water solution were poured in the feed tank where a nitrogen gas cylinder was used to provide the transmembrane pressure and the liquid inside the cell was stirred the permeate weight was continuously recorded by a digital balance connected to a computer in a given time the membranes were pretreated and stabilized at 2 bar for 30 min before the actual measurements afterward the pure water flux and bsa rejection experiments were carried out at 1 bar the pure water flux pwf l m2 h or lmh was determined by the eq 1 1 p w f v a δ t where v l is the permeate volume a m2 is the effective ﬁltration area and δt h is the permeation time a 500 ppm bsa solution was filled into the feed tank for examining the membranes fouling resistance and rejection right after the first pure water permeation test after 90 min bsa solution filtration three feed samples and permeates were obtained every 10 min to make sure the rejection is stable and then the bsa rejection was measured next the membranes were brought out of the cells in order to putting them in fresh water for 30 min meanwhile the feed tank was washed using di water to calculate the flux recovery ratio frr of the membranes the second pure water flux experiment was

dw is the water density 998 kg m3 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphological studies the surface cross sectional and enlarged cross sectional morphology of the pristine pes membranes and pes mmms clay pes sio2 pes tio2 pes mwcnts oh pes and mwcnts cooh pes fabricated using two different concentrations of pes namely 15 and 18 wt were observed by sem as illustrated in figs 2 and 3 respectively the cross sectional images for both pristine pes membranes and mmms fabricated in this work presented a typical porous and asymmetric structure which owns a very thin semi dense top layer as well as a porous and rich in macrovoids sub layer based on the cross sectional sem images both pristine pes membranes and pes mmms possess a relatively alike macrovoid structure that is due to the significant affinity between solvents nmp or dmac and non solvent water as well as immediate demixing during phase inversion however fabricated membranes using pes concentration of 15 wt fig 2 apparently demonstrate higher porosity fig 4 and more macrovoids in their structure compared to those fabricated membranes using pes concentration of 18 wt fig 3 generally the incorporation of hydrophilic nanoparticulate influences both kinetics and thermodynamic of the phase inversion process which leads to the observation of dissimilar morphologies 36 37 unlike pristine pes dope solution adding a hydrophilic nanoscale material in the dope induces a much faster solvent non solvent exchange rate a faster water diffusion into the as cast polymeric film resulting in macrovoid development and overall porosity improvement fig 4 20 25 26 38 interestingly at higher loadings of nanoparticulate the dope solution viscosity increases which can be seen visually consequently higher viscosity affects the phase inversion kinetic which diminishes the solvent non solvent exchange rate during the membrane formation the phase inversion rate and solvent non solvent immediate demixing are the main dissuasive for any structural changes and accordingly the membrane s top layer morphology becomes denser 15 20 with increasing nanoparticulate loading regardless of the membrane structural transformation the cross sectional morphology did not change to sponge like this observation has been seen previously for polymers like pvdf and psf 20 39 these results are also in a good agreement with literature findings on nanocomposite membranes 16 20 40 42 membranes fabricated using dmac tend to have higher porosity based on both visual observation figs 2 and 3 and porosity measurements fig 5 this change may arise from their dissimilar precipitation paths and phase inversion rates the solubility parameter δt and of solvents and pes 43 44 used were tabulated in table 2 pes is considered as a polar polymer and usually more entanglements will form on a molecular chain when a solvent with greater solubility parameter and polarity is utilized this is because of the more powerful interactions between solvent and polymer molecules 43 as shown in table 2 the polarity δp and solubility parameter δt of nmp are greater than dmac consequently further stress will be fixed between entanglements in the membranes fabricated using nmp as the solvent consequently more shrinkage will be appeared in the drying process furthermore comparing δt and δp parameters table 2 as well as porosity measurements fig 5 suggested that a greater polarity and solubility parameter of solvent lead to a lower porosity or higher shrinkage of the membrane fabricated from the casting solution with the solvent based on the top surface sem images the pristine pes membranes and pes mmms all display a relatively smooth top surface with no signiﬁcant difference comparing of trend of porosity change with different nanoparticulates show different porosity trends for the membranes casted from 15 and 18 wt pes solutions for the membranes casted from 15 wt pes solution the membrane porosity decrease in the row pes clay pes tio2 pes sio2 fig 4a while for 18 wt pes solution the membrane porosity decrease in the row pes sio2 pes tio2 pes clay fig 4b these trends could be explained by considering polymer solution viscosity and nanoparticulates structure and size by increasing pes concentration the viscosity of casting solution increases and probably movement of bigger sheet form nanoparticulates like as clay is restricted and its influence is reduces causing to diminish of the clay embedded membrane porosity 3 2 static water contact angle the surface hydrophilicity of the fabricated pes membranes and pes mmms are evaluated by means of the static water contact angle and the data are shown in fig 6 the contact angle data for the pes mmms are slightly lower than the pristine pes membrane where 15 and 18 wt of pes and nmp or dmac are used to prepare the membranes as shown in fig 6a b adding a small quantity of different nanoparticulates bring about minor variations in membrane hydrophilicity these variations could be related to the migration of the nanoparticulates to the membrane surface this phenomenon is due to a decrease in the gravitational force or interface energy 45 46 a reduction in water contact angle usually results in a greater surface hydrophilicity for the mmms which is more advantageous to the water permeability and antifouling characteristics the results show that the contact angle of membranes with dmac as a solvent is higher than the membranes prepared by nmp in 15 w pes but it has different results in 18 wt pes membranes it should be mentioned that the contact angle is related to membrane surface porosity pore size and roughness in addition to its chemistry 47 by increasing of polymer concentration the porosity and pore size of the membranes decrease and probably cause to reduce of surface roughness the membranes with lower pore size have lower roughness 48 also it is reported that the membrane with higher surface roughness has higher contact angle 49 based on these knowledges by increasing of pes concentration in nmp solvent the porosity of the 18 wt pes nmp membranes extremely reduced related to pes dmac see fig 5 causing to increase of contact angle of pes nmp membranes 3 3 filtration performance the pure water fluxes of all the fabricated pristine pes membranes and pes mmms using 15 and 18 wt of pes concentrations were examined at the operating pressure of 1 bar for 120 min as shown in fig 7 as the nanoparticulate loading increases the water flux enhances and then at the higher loadings of the nanoparticulate the water flux diminishes the incorporation of nanoparticulate into the pes matrix could affect water permeation by both flux enhancement due to the hydrophilicity and porosity increment as well as flux reduction owing to pore blockage for higher nanoparticulate loadings 29 embedding the nanoparticulate results in an improved connectivity between the top layer and support layer of the membrane as well as a highly porous structure figs 2 and 3 which could possibly diminish the membrane s resistance to water permeation furthermore the incorporation of nanoparticulate leads to an improved hydrophilicity fig 6 and subsequently a higher water permeability hence the mmms have a tendency to absorb more water molecules and exhibit improved water penetration compared to that of the pristine membranes because of the greater hydrophilicity and lower structural resistance 25 26 50 however a higher nanoparticulate loading results in a lower water flux possibly owing to the agglomeration of the nanoparticulate and the pore blockage induced by nanoparticulate 26 this phenomenon may diminish the advantageous effect of hydrophilicity porosity and structural resistance on water permeation moreover as mentioned earlier a higher loading of nanoparticulate brings about a greater dope viscosity and it subsequently causes the formation of a thicker skin layer which rises the membrane resistance and decreases its permeability 42 50 although the sonication of the nanoparticulate solvent solution was done to obtain a well dispersed solution prior to the addition of pes at the higher loadings of nanoparticulate the agglomeration of the nanoparticulate is unavoidable 26 this observation reveals that further increasing nanoparticulate loading to a loading greater than a nanoparticulate s optimize loading would bring about severe pore blockage and permeation decrease the literature is also in good agreement with the findings 16 18 25 26 28 29 fig 4 displays the porosity of the fabricated membranes all the prepared membranes enjoy a porosity ranging between 52 to 75 for those prepared using pes concentration of 15 wt thanks to the low polymer concentration and presence of 1 wt of pore former additive pvp in the dope solution 51 however the membrane porosities are ranged from 27 to 64 for those prepared using pes concentration of 18 wt in the dope solution higher concentration of pes results in a denser membrane with much lower porosity and water flux as expected 4 indeed the addition of nanoparticulate generally boosts the porosity where a faster exchange of solvent non solvent and precipitation rate are anticipated 18 also larger pores are likely to form because the pore size might be affected by the hydrophilic nanoparticulate and their induced faster demixing as it has been discussed previously the porosity decreases at higher nanoparticulate loadings owing to the minor agglomeration of nanoparticulate and higher dope solution viscosity 20 28 29 it has been comprehensively discussed that pes dmac membranes be subject to possess greater porosity based on both visual observation figs 2 and 3 and porosity measurements fig 5 compared to that of pes nmp membranes due to the dissimilar precipitation paths and phase inversion rates which arise from different polarity and solubility parameter of dmac and nmp based on fig 8 it is evidence that pes dmac membranes have shown a considerably better water flux compared to the pes nmp membranes possibly due to the mentioned reasons the bsa rejections towards the pristine pes membrane and pes mmms are also studied surprisingly the bsa rejections for all the fabricated membranes using pes concentration of 15 wt are greater than 98 while the bsa rejections for those of using pes concentration of 18 wt are nearly 100 3 4 antifouling properties one of the key features influencing the efficiency of membrane separation is antifouling properties particularly this issue becomes more significant for hydrophobic materials like pes pvdf and pvc 18 20 28 the pes membranes usually experience dreadful fouling in processes including foulant such as whey natural organic matter nom or microorganism the foulants cause water flux reduction as a result of the fouling phenomenon on the membrane surface nevertheless a sufficiently effective membrane modification method would be employed to reduce fouling effect as much as possible and change it to reversible fouling where washing backwashing method can recover the flux after foulant permeation to evaluate the membranes antifouling properties they were subjected to a bsa solution permeation test the membranes fluxes decreased until they reached the steady fluxes the interaction of the membrane surface with bsa molecules may probably form a thin gel layer and hence it enhances the membrane resistance and accordingly reduces flux however the presence of hydrophilic nanoparticulate on both inter pores and membrane surface will possibly weaken the interaction between membrane and bsa and reduce bsa adsorption and thus diminish the membrane fouling 20 40 50 in our previous work results shown that the adsorption of bsa reduces by addition of hydrophilic nanoparticles 52 figs 9 and 10 demonstrate the flux recovery ratio frr of the membranes the membranes frr improves with increasing the nanoparticulate loading and then slightly reduces at greater nanoparticulate concentrations the frr increases from 54 for the pristine pes membrane p15 n to 124 for the 1 t p15 n membrane which shows the greatest antifouling properties among all the prepared membranes the results reveal that protein fouling has a tendency to be more reversible with an increase in nanoparticulate loading nonetheless higher nanoparticulate concentrations bring about a slightly reduced frr which might be associated to the agglomeration inordinate nanoparticulate loading causes a significant agglomeration on the membrane surface 26 declining the hydrophilic group s contact areas of the incorporated nanoparticulate and probably weakens repulsion between membrane surface and protein 38 these findings perfectly agree with the other mixed matrix membranes used for water applications 18 20 28 29 42 although there is a critical value for the nanoparticulate loading the pure water flux and frr of the most mmms fabricated in this work even with higher nanoparticulate concentrations are considerably more than that of the pristine pes membrane which confirms that agglomeration does not have a substantial effect on the mmms performance by embedding the hydrophilic nanoscale fillers into the membrane surface a hydrated layer is formed which will probably reduce the foulants attachment efficiently 52 53 therefore it can be concluded that the addition of nanoparticulate into the pes matrix for manufacturing the uf membranes may boost the antifouling characteristics of the fabricated membranes fig 10 compares the frr of the pes dmac and pes nmp membranes the pes nmp membranes tend to exhibit a superior frr compared to that of pes dmac membranes this could possibly arise from the greater porosity and probably bigger pore sizes of the latter as compared with that of former because a bigger pore size is more favorable to foulant entrapments the best performance in case of flux improvement 320 and frr enhancement 130 was achieved for the 1 t p15 n where the membrane showed a great bsa rejection of 98 this is probably due to the membrane s great hydrophilicity and high porosity 66 5 with controlled mwco 3 5 benchmark table 3 presents a comparison between the antifouling properties of the developed pes based mmms and previously reported pes mmms the frr of the 1 t p15 n nanocomposite membrane is found to be much higher than that of a wide variety of pes based mmms including commercially prepared or custom synthesized nanomaterials 4 conclusions five various nanoparticulate comprising of clay sio2 tio2 mwcnts oh and mwcnts cooh were chosen to ameliorate the morphology antifouling characteristics and separation performance of the pes uf membranes five different concentrations of each nanoparticulate were added to the dope solutions including 15 or 18 wt of pes 1 wt of pvp as a pore former and dmac or nmp as the solvent the nips was utilized to prepare the uf membranes the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the cross sectional and surface sem images revealed that there is no significant morphological change for the mmms compared to the pristine pes membrane however the membranes fabricated using dmac as solvent or pes concentration of 15 wt was found to be more porous than those of fabricated using nmp or pes concentration of 18 wt the mmms porosity trend was found to be up and down as the nanoparticulate loading was increased in the dope 2 the water contact angle measurements confirmed that the mmms generally possess an improved hydrophilicity enhanced hydrophilicity and porosity led to a notable increase in water flux clay pes mmm 1 c p15 n exhibited the best water flux with an 850 higher water flux compared to the pristine pes membrane nevertheless greater loadings of nanoparticulate resulted in lower water fluxes owing to a denser structure and the agglomeration of the nanoparticulate 3 the nanoparticulate incorporation led to a significant improvement in flux recovery ratio and thus the pes mmms exhibited excellent fouling resistance as compared with the pristine pes membrane this perfection might be associated to the hydrophilicity improvement induces by the presence of the nanoparticulate 4 based on our findings tio2 pes 1 t p15 n is recommended as the best nanoparticulate for the pes uf membrane modification since it exhibited the superlative performance with a 320 water flux enhancement nearly 98 bsa rejection and 130 frr improvement acknowledgments this work has been

carried out at 1 bar the pure water flux pwf l m2 h or lmh was determined by the eq 1 1 p w f v a δ t where v l is the permeate volume a m2 is the effective ﬁltration area and δt h is the permeation time a 500 ppm bsa solution was filled into the feed tank for examining the membranes fouling resistance and rejection right after the first pure water permeation test after 90 min bsa solution filtration three feed samples and permeates were obtained every 10 min to make sure the rejection is stable and then the bsa rejection was measured next the membranes were brought out of the cells in order to putting them in fresh water for 30 min meanwhile the feed tank was washed using di water to calculate the flux recovery ratio frr of the membranes the second pure water flux experiment was then performed the following equation was used to determine frr 2 f r r p w f w a t e r 2 p w f w a t e r 1 100 where pwfwater 2 and pwfwater 1 are the pure water flux after and before bsa solution permeation test respectively to evaluate the separation ability of the membranes the bsa rejection r was determined using the following equation 3 r 1 c p c f 100 where cp and cf are the bsa concentrations in permeate and feed respectively 2 5 porosity the gravimetric method based on the water sorption was used to measure the overall porosity ε of the prepared membranes as written in the following equation 35 4 ε w 1 w 2 a l d w 100 where w1 and w2 are the weights of membranes in wet and dry conditions kg respectively a is the dry membrane area m2 l is the dry membrane thickness m and dw is the water density 998 kg m3 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphological studies the surface cross sectional and enlarged cross sectional morphology of the pristine pes membranes and pes mmms clay pes sio2 pes tio2 pes mwcnts oh pes and mwcnts cooh pes fabricated using two different concentrations of pes namely 15 and 18 wt were observed by sem as illustrated in figs 2 and 3 respectively the cross sectional images for both pristine pes membranes and mmms fabricated in this work presented a typical porous and asymmetric structure which owns a very thin semi dense top layer as well as a porous and rich in macrovoids sub layer based on the cross sectional sem images both pristine pes membranes and pes mmms possess a relatively alike macrovoid structure that is due to the significant affinity between solvents nmp or dmac and non solvent water as well as immediate demixing during phase inversion however fabricated membranes using pes concentration of 15 wt fig 2 apparently demonstrate higher porosity fig 4 and more macrovoids in their structure compared to those fabricated membranes using pes concentration of 18 wt fig 3 generally the incorporation of hydrophilic nanoparticulate influences both kinetics and thermodynamic of the phase inversion process which leads to the observation of dissimilar morphologies 36 37 unlike pristine pes dope solution adding a hydrophilic nanoscale material in the dope induces a much faster solvent non solvent exchange rate a faster water diffusion into the as cast polymeric film resulting in macrovoid development and overall porosity improvement fig 4 20 25 26 38 interestingly at higher loadings of nanoparticulate the dope solution viscosity increases which can be seen visually consequently higher viscosity affects the phase inversion kinetic which diminishes the solvent non solvent exchange rate during the membrane formation the phase inversion rate and solvent non solvent immediate demixing are the main dissuasive for any structural changes and accordingly the membrane s top layer morphology becomes denser 15 20 with increasing nanoparticulate loading regardless of the membrane structural transformation the cross sectional morphology did not change to sponge like this observation has been seen previously for polymers like pvdf and psf 20 39 these results are also in a good agreement with literature findings on nanocomposite membranes 16 20 40 42 membranes fabricated using dmac tend to have higher porosity based on both visual observation figs 2 and 3 and porosity measurements fig 5 this change may arise from their dissimilar precipitation paths and phase inversion rates the solubility parameter δt and of solvents and pes 43 44 used were tabulated in table 2 pes is considered as a polar polymer and usually more entanglements will form on a molecular chain when a solvent with greater solubility parameter and polarity is utilized this is because of the more powerful interactions between solvent and polymer molecules 43 as shown in table 2 the polarity δp and solubility parameter δt of nmp are greater than dmac consequently further stress will be fixed between entanglements in the membranes fabricated using nmp as the solvent consequently more shrinkage will be appeared in the drying process furthermore comparing δt and δp parameters table 2 as well as porosity measurements fig 5 suggested that a greater polarity and solubility parameter of solvent lead to a lower porosity or higher shrinkage of the membrane fabricated from the casting solution with the solvent based on the top surface sem images the pristine pes membranes and pes mmms all display a relatively smooth top surface with no signiﬁcant difference comparing of trend of porosity change with different nanoparticulates show different porosity trends for the membranes casted from 15 and 18 wt pes solutions for the membranes casted from 15 wt pes solution the membrane porosity decrease in the row pes clay pes tio2 pes sio2 fig 4a while for 18 wt pes solution the membrane porosity decrease in the row pes sio2 pes tio2 pes clay fig 4b these trends could be explained by considering polymer solution viscosity and nanoparticulates structure and size by increasing pes concentration the viscosity of casting solution increases and probably movement of bigger sheet form nanoparticulates like as clay is restricted and its influence is reduces causing to diminish of the clay embedded membrane porosity 3 2 static water contact angle the surface hydrophilicity of the fabricated pes membranes and pes mmms are evaluated by means of the static water contact angle and the data are shown in fig 6 the contact angle data for the pes mmms are slightly lower than the pristine pes membrane where 15 and 18 wt of pes and nmp or dmac are used to prepare the membranes as shown in fig 6a b adding a small quantity of different nanoparticulates bring about minor variations in membrane hydrophilicity these variations could be related to the migration of the nanoparticulates to the membrane surface this phenomenon is due to a decrease in the gravitational force or interface energy 45 46 a reduction in water contact angle usually results in a greater surface hydrophilicity for the mmms which is more advantageous to the water permeability and antifouling characteristics the results show that the contact angle of membranes with dmac as a solvent is higher than the membranes prepared by nmp in 15 w pes but it has different results in 18 wt pes membranes it should be mentioned that the contact angle is related to membrane surface porosity pore size and roughness in addition to its chemistry 47 by increasing of polymer concentration the porosity and pore size of the membranes decrease and probably cause to reduce of surface roughness the membranes with lower pore size have lower roughness 48 also it is reported that the membrane with higher surface roughness has higher contact angle 49 based on these knowledges by increasing of pes concentration in nmp solvent the porosity of the 18 wt pes nmp membranes extremely reduced related to pes dmac see fig 5 causing to increase of contact angle of pes nmp membranes 3 3 filtration performance the pure water fluxes of all the fabricated pristine pes membranes and pes mmms using 15 and 18 wt of pes concentrations were examined at the operating pressure of 1 bar for 120 min as shown in fig 7 as the nanoparticulate loading increases the water flux enhances and then at the higher loadings of the nanoparticulate the water flux diminishes the incorporation of nanoparticulate into the pes matrix could affect water permeation by both flux enhancement due to the hydrophilicity and porosity increment as well as flux reduction owing to pore blockage for higher nanoparticulate loadings 29 embedding the nanoparticulate results in an improved connectivity between the top layer and support layer of the membrane as well as a highly porous structure figs 2 and 3 which could possibly diminish the membrane s resistance to water permeation furthermore the incorporation of nanoparticulate leads to an improved hydrophilicity fig 6 and subsequently a higher water permeability hence the mmms have a tendency to absorb more water molecules and exhibit improved water penetration compared to that of the pristine membranes because of the greater hydrophilicity and lower structural resistance 25 26 50 however a higher nanoparticulate loading results in a lower water flux possibly owing to the agglomeration of the nanoparticulate and the pore blockage induced by nanoparticulate 26 this phenomenon may diminish the advantageous effect of hydrophilicity porosity and structural resistance on water permeation moreover as mentioned earlier a higher loading of nanoparticulate brings about a greater dope viscosity and it subsequently causes the formation of a thicker skin layer which rises the membrane resistance and decreases its permeability 42 50 although the sonication of the nanoparticulate solvent solution was done to obtain a well dispersed solution prior to the addition of pes at the higher loadings of nanoparticulate the agglomeration of the nanoparticulate is unavoidable 26 this observation reveals that further increasing nanoparticulate loading to a loading greater than a nanoparticulate s optimize loading would bring about severe pore blockage and permeation decrease the literature is also in good agreement with the findings 16 18 25 26 28 29 fig 4 displays the porosity of the fabricated membranes all the prepared membranes enjoy a porosity ranging between 52 to 75 for those prepared using pes concentration of 15 wt thanks to the low polymer concentration and presence of 1 wt of pore former additive pvp in the dope solution 51 however the membrane porosities are ranged from 27 to 64 for those prepared using pes concentration of 18 wt in the dope solution higher concentration of pes results in a denser membrane with much lower porosity and water flux as expected 4 indeed the addition of nanoparticulate generally boosts the porosity where a faster exchange of solvent non solvent and precipitation rate are anticipated 18 also larger pores are likely to form because the pore size might be affected by the hydrophilic nanoparticulate and their induced faster demixing as it has been discussed previously the porosity decreases at higher nanoparticulate loadings owing to the minor agglomeration of nanoparticulate and higher dope solution viscosity 20 28 29 it has been comprehensively discussed that pes dmac membranes be subject to possess greater porosity based on both visual observation figs 2 and 3 and porosity measurements fig 5 compared to that of pes nmp membranes due to the dissimilar precipitation paths and phase inversion rates which arise from different polarity and solubility parameter of dmac and nmp based on fig 8 it is evidence that pes dmac membranes have shown a considerably better water flux compared to the pes nmp membranes possibly due to the mentioned reasons the bsa rejections towards the pristine pes membrane and pes mmms are also studied surprisingly the bsa rejections for all the fabricated membranes using pes concentration of 15 wt are greater than 98 while the bsa rejections for those of using pes concentration of 18 wt are nearly 100 3 4 antifouling properties one of the key features influencing the efficiency of membrane separation is antifouling properties particularly this issue becomes more significant for hydrophobic materials like pes pvdf and pvc 18 20 28 the pes membranes usually experience dreadful fouling in processes including foulant such as whey natural organic matter nom or microorganism the foulants cause water flux reduction as a result of the fouling phenomenon on the membrane surface nevertheless a sufficiently effective membrane modification method would be employed to reduce fouling effect as much as possible and change it to reversible fouling where washing backwashing method can recover the flux after foulant permeation to evaluate the membranes antifouling properties they were subjected to a bsa solution permeation test the membranes fluxes decreased until they reached the steady fluxes the interaction of the membrane surface with bsa molecules may probably form a thin gel layer and hence it enhances the membrane resistance and accordingly reduces flux however the presence of hydrophilic nanoparticulate on both inter pores and membrane surface will possibly weaken the interaction between membrane and bsa and reduce bsa adsorption and thus diminish the membrane fouling 20 40 50 in our previous work results shown that the adsorption of bsa reduces by addition of hydrophilic nanoparticles 52 figs 9 and 10 demonstrate the flux recovery ratio frr of the membranes the membranes frr improves with increasing the nanoparticulate loading and then slightly reduces at greater nanoparticulate concentrations the frr increases from 54 for the pristine pes membrane p15 n to 124 for the 1 t p15 n membrane which shows the greatest antifouling properties among all the prepared membranes the results reveal that protein fouling has a tendency to be more reversible with an increase in nanoparticulate loading nonetheless higher nanoparticulate concentrations bring about a slightly reduced frr which might be associated to the agglomeration inordinate nanoparticulate loading causes a significant agglomeration on the membrane surface 26 declining the hydrophilic group s contact areas of the incorporated nanoparticulate and probably weakens repulsion between membrane surface and protein 38 these findings perfectly agree with the other mixed matrix membranes used for water applications 18 20 28 29 42 although there is a critical value for the nanoparticulate loading the pure water flux and frr of the most mmms fabricated in this work even with higher nanoparticulate concentrations are considerably more than that of the pristine pes membrane which confirms that agglomeration does not have a substantial effect on the mmms performance by embedding the hydrophilic nanoscale fillers into the membrane surface a hydrated layer is formed which will probably reduce the foulants attachment efficiently 52 53 therefore it can be concluded that the addition of nanoparticulate into the pes matrix for manufacturing the uf membranes may boost the antifouling characteristics of the fabricated membranes fig 10 compares the frr of the pes dmac and pes nmp membranes the pes nmp membranes tend to exhibit a superior frr compared to that of pes dmac membranes this could possibly arise from the greater porosity and probably bigger pore sizes of the latter as compared with that of former because a bigger pore size is more favorable to foulant entrapments the best performance in case of flux improvement 320 and frr enhancement 130 was achieved for the 1 t p15 n where the membrane showed a great bsa rejection of 98 this is probably due to the membrane s great hydrophilicity and high porosity 66 5 with controlled mwco 3 5 benchmark table 3 presents a comparison between the antifouling properties of the developed pes based mmms and previously reported pes mmms the frr of the 1 t p15 n nanocomposite membrane is found to be much higher than that of a wide variety of pes based mmms including commercially prepared or custom synthesized nanomaterials 4 conclusions five various nanoparticulate comprising of clay sio2 tio2 mwcnts oh and mwcnts cooh were chosen to ameliorate the morphology antifouling characteristics and separation performance of the pes uf membranes five different concentrations of each nanoparticulate were added to the dope solutions including 15 or 18 wt of pes 1 wt of pvp as a pore former and dmac or nmp as the solvent the nips was utilized to prepare the uf membranes the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the cross sectional and surface sem images revealed that there is no significant morphological change for the mmms compared to the pristine pes membrane however the membranes fabricated using dmac as solvent or pes concentration of 15 wt was found to be more porous than those of fabricated using nmp or pes concentration of 18 wt the mmms porosity trend was found to be up and down as the nanoparticulate loading was increased in the dope 2 the water contact angle measurements confirmed that the mmms generally possess an improved hydrophilicity enhanced hydrophilicity and porosity led to a notable increase in water flux clay pes mmm 1 c p15 n exhibited the best water flux with an 850 higher water flux compared to the pristine pes membrane nevertheless greater loadings of nanoparticulate resulted in lower water fluxes owing to a denser structure and the agglomeration of the nanoparticulate 3 the nanoparticulate incorporation led to a significant improvement in flux recovery ratio and thus the pes mmms exhibited excellent fouling resistance as compared with the pristine pes membrane this perfection might be associated to the hydrophilicity improvement induces by the presence of the nanoparticulate 4 based on our findings tio2 pes 1 t p15 n is recommended as the best nanoparticulate for the pes uf membrane modification since it exhibited the superlative performance with a 320 water flux enhancement nearly 98 bsa rejection and 130 frr improvement acknowledgments this work has been

14461,water is a fragile resource consequently there is a pressing need to develop sustainable environmental friendly disinfection technologies this constitutes the first study to compare efficacy of continuous low pressure uv lpuv to that of pulsed uv light puv for uv disinfection performance in flow through water systems bacillus endospores were used as these are frequently deployed as biodosimeters for drinking water uv reactor validation protocols results showed a puv system output of 2 052 mj cm 2 energy below 300 nm was required for a 2 log inactivation of b pumilus endospores whereas a lower lpuv system output of 12 mj cm 2 produced a similar level of disinfection measurements of dose incident to the samples which were 10 75 cm from the puv light source showed supplementation of cultivation media with manganese sulphate monohydrate mnso4 h2o employed to enhance the rate of endospore formation for propagation was shown to increase the uv resistance of different bacillus spp to both irradiation approaches p 0 05 conventional lpuv light that is commonly used by the drinking water industry is a reliable and superior approach to puv which requires substantial modification for effective disinfection of continuous flow through water caution must also be exercised when manipulating media formulation to propagate endospores as this may lead to

ultraviolet uv treatment as a method of tertiary disinfection for drinking water treatment and for wastewater treatment has increased significantly worldwide in recent years 1 2 a key driver of this uptake may be attributed to its success of inactivating chlorine resistant pathogens in particular cryptosporidium parvum 3 4 uv treatment is also a physical disinfection method that is not associated with the formation of harmful disinfection by products e g trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids which are typically associated with free chlorines chloramines disinfection applications in addition advanced oxidation processes that utilise uv treatment in combination with other chemical treatments e g hydrogen peroxide are effective in the degradation of a number of organic pollutants 5 6 uv irradiation is effective at inactivating a variety of pathogens where uv dose or fluence mj cm 2 is defined as the uv intensity mw cm 2 multiplied by the exposure time s in a laboratory setting a collimated beam apparatus can be used to deliver a controlled amount of uv energy to receiving samples thus the uv dose may be accurately determined in contrast uv reactors installed at drinking water treatment plants may be subject to varying water flow dynamics varying influent water quality and varying uv intensities within the reactor due to lamp aging and fouling etc 7 10 these variations can in turn lead to inaccuracies when determining the exact uv dose delivered for this reason each uv reactor should undergo validation testing whereby biodosimetry is used to determine a reduction equivalent dose red from the reactor 7 11 13 the process involves measuring the inactivation of a robust or challenge microorganism after it has been exposed to uv light within the reactor and then comparing the inactivation level to a uv dose response curve of the same microorganism ascertained under controlled laboratory conditions using a collimated beam apparatus from this a red may be determined 14 there are three primary uv reactor validation guidelines protocols that are observed internationally the us environmental protection agency us epa uv disinfection guidance manual uvdgm the german association for gas water deutsche vereinigung des gas und wasserfaches dvgw w294 and the austrian standards institute österreichisches normungsinstitut önorm m 58373 1 7 12 13 the uvdgm is typically applied for uv reactor validation testing in north america however as a guideline document it does not set out one standard protocol but rather recommends validation protocols based on the type of water source to be treated and the target pathogen in question the red is determined using the biodosimetry of a surrogate challenge microorganism with a similar uv sensitivity to the specific target pathogen requiring inactivation e g ms2 bacteriophage may be used a surrogate organism for the inactivation of cryptosporidium 7 in europe the primary accepted protocols for uv reactor validation tend to be the önorm and the dvgw protocols both protocols stipulate that all uv reactors are required to supply a constant minimum uv dose of 40 mj cm 2 with the dvgw specifying bacillus subtilis endospores to be used as the challenge microorganism for biodosimetry analysis 12 13 bacillus endospores are commonly linked to uv disinfection studies b subtilis endospores have historically been used as pathogen surrogates in uv reactor validation trials as they are non pathogenic and exhibit an increased resistance to uv irradiation in comparison to most waterborne pathogens 7 15 b pumilus endospores have recently been suggested as suitable surrogates for the highly uv resistant waterborne pathogen human adenovirus hadv due to exhibiting similar levels of uv resistance 16 17 moreover studies have shown b pumilus endospores and hadv to be almost ten times more sensitive to uv irradiation at 220 nm in comparison to the standard 254 nm wavelength 18 19 thus its potential as a surrogate challenge organism for hadv in puv reactor validation trials is significant the cultivation of bacillus spp endospores in a laboratory typically involves the addition of supplement manganese sulphate monohydrate mnso4 h2o for rapid endospore propagation 20 a concentration of approximately 0 05 mm mnso4 h2o is recommended by the german national resource center dsmz for the sporulation of bacillus spp strains while a concentration of up to 0 1 mm mnso4 h2o has been applied in a number of research studies 16 18 21 27 recent studies have shown a relationship between bacillus spp endospores cultivated on agar supplemented with mnso4 h2o and increased uv resistance to lpuv disinfection 16 17 19 however little information is available regarding bacillus spp endospores cultivated on agar supplemented with mnso4 h2o and enhanced uv resistance to pulsed uv puv disinfection the modification of bacillus spp endospore uv resistance may be an important consideration in laboratory scale analysis particularly as bacillus subtilis endospores are currently the challenge organism of choice for uv system validation under dvgw regulations puv systems have been widely researched for application within the food industry and are characterised by high energy outputs and shorter contact times in comparison to standard lpuv disinfection systems 28 30 typically a polychromatic xenon lamp is used which emits light within the broadspectrum of the uv visible and infrared range 200 1100 nm with approximately 25 of the energy output in the uv spectrum 31 electricity is stored in a capacitor and released in extremely short pulses that lasts microseconds the frequency of pulses typically range between 1 and 10 pulses per second pps low pressure mercury lamps are reported to have a coefficient of efficiency ce of approximately 35 50 for the conversion of electrical energy to uv irradiation at 254 nm whereas high pressure pulsed lamps i e xenon lamps are reported to have a lower ce of approximately 10 15 32 33 in addition the power emitted from pulsed uv lamps is generally at least an order of magnitude higher than the power emitted from lpuv lamps table 1 compares the uv dose requirements of puv and lpuv systems for the log inactivation of various microorganisms the uv dose calculated for the puv systems typically includes the full polychromatic broadspectrum energy output in comparison to monochromatic energy output for lpuv systems at 254 nm some studies investigating puv disinfection efficiency include only the energy emitted from wavelengths in the uv range approximately 200 400 nm and calculate the uv output of the system accordingly while others include both the total broadband fluence dose and the uv fluence dose 34 36 flow through puv systems are relatively unexplored in the water wastewater disinfection sector but are noted as a promising alternative to lpuv as studies suggest high energy outputs may decrease contact times and inhibit photoreactivation 44 the use of xenon gas is considered more environmentally friendly than the standard mercury vapour lpuv lamps 30 however questions remain as to whether the intensity and or peak power of the applied puv fluence for water treatment applications has a considerable impact on microbial inactivation in comparison to lpuv applications a lack of clarity regarding how the uv dose for puv systems is determined can hinder replication studies and does not allow for direct comparisons 45 studies analysing lpuv systems which are set up as a continually mixing flow through system also appear to be limited such experimental set ups may aid comparisons to lpuv operations on site thus this study compared continuous lpuv and puv flow through irradiation systems for reliable and repeatable disinfection of bacillus endospores that were artificially grown and harvested from agar supplemented with manganese sulphate 2 materials and methods 2 1 puv system analysis a bench scale pulsed power source puv 01 samtech ltd glasgow was used to power a low pressure 60 kpa xenon filled flash lamp heraeus noblelight xap type nl4006 series constructed from a clear uv transparent quartz tube which produced a high intensity beam of polychromatic pulsed light 200 1100 nm a schematic figure of the system is available in the supplementary material figure s1 the lamp was placed 10 75 cm above a sterilised aluminium flow through vessel with a plan surface area of 290 cm 2 through which water was pumped at various flow rates corresponding to hydraulic residence times hrt being investigated hrts ranged between 65 s and 100 s the puv system allowed for the input voltage and the pulse rate to be varied between 400 and 1000 v and for a pulse frequency of between 0 1 and 10 pulses per second the uv output was determined by calculating the output voltage energy in combination with the sample distance from the xenon lamp the area of the vessel the pps and the hrt it is important to note that the adjustable factors listed as well as the type of sample medium influences the penetration of the puv light thus the energy delivered by the lamp is different to the energy received by the sample for example at 900 v 2pps and 100 s hrt the uv output was calculated to be 2052 mj cm 2 20 5 mw cm 2 112 mw cm 2 broadband output all puv outputs are presented to include only the wavelengths below 300 nm the total broadband dose received by the sample was analysed using a thermopile power detector model xlp12 3s h2 in gentec eo quebec canada in conjunction with integra software the detector 12 mm aperture was placed on the aluminium vessel 10 75 cm below the xenon lamp pulse energies were measured three times at each voltage setting after which an average value was obtained in addition two longpass colour glass filters fgl 400 and fgl 280 thorlabs gmbh dachau germany were also used to filter out the wavelengths emitted from the lamp below the uv range and below the uvc range respectively the filters were placed separately on top of the detector head and the power measurements were taken as previously described the differences in the power values obtained with and without the filters was used to calculate the power emitted from the lamp within the uv and the uvc range table 2 outlines the calculated total broadband puv power output per voltage setting and the measured puv dose as measured by the thermopile detector in addition to the measured uv and uvc power the uv filters were applied to 800 and 900 v settings only as these were the two voltage settings used throughout the experimental analysis 2 2 lpuv system analysis the continuous flow monochromatic lpuv system lcd 412 plus s i t a halpin hayward ltd had a fixed power output of 40 w at a uv c wavelength of 254 nm the uv output could be altered by varying the influent flow rate thereby altering the hrt which equated to exposure time the flow rates ranged between 11 l min and 27 l min which corresponded to hrts of between 1 66 s and 0 42 s to give a uv output range between 12 6 mj cm 2 and 31 9 mj cm 2 respectively the uv output was calculated using the rated energy of the system in addition a transmissivity sensor was also used to monitor uv transmittance which remained above 80 at all times a schematic figure of the system is available in the supplementary material figure s2 2 3 endospore analysis bacterial test strains dsm 492 bacillus pumilus and dsm 347 bacillus subtilis were sourced from the german national resource center dsmz braunschweig germany the strains were equivalent to atcc 27142 bacillus pumilus and atcc 6633 bacillus subtilis vegetative cells of both strains were cultivated on nutrient agar biolab lennox ireland at 35 c for 24 h to produce pure colonies one pure colony was inoculated into 100 ml tryptic soy broth sigma aldrich wicklow ireland and placed on a rotary shaker at 90 rpm for 24 h at 30 35 c after incubation 0 5 ml of the 24 hour culture was spread onto nutrient agar plates and incubated for at least four days at 30 35 c to encourage endospore production endospores cultivated in the presence of mnso4 h2o were spread onto nutrient agar plates which were supplemented with various mnso4 h2o honeywell sigma aldrich wicklow ireland concentrations ranging from 0 005 mm to 0 5 mm after incubation a sporulation rate of approximately 90 was achieved that was confirmed by endospore staining schaeffer and fulton spore stain kit sigma aldrich wicklow ireland using light microscopy endospores were collected by flooding the plate with 8 ml distilled water after which a sterile spreader was used to gather endospores from the seeded plates the water endospore emulsion was then aseptically transferred to a sterile 30 ml glass vial before being placed into a water bath at 80 c for 20 min to kill any remaining vegetative cells once heat treated endospores suspended in water were used in uv trials within 4 h b pumilus and b subtilis endospores were exposed in separate batches to a range of puv outputs from 0 to 2052 mj cm 2 and lpuv outputs from 12 to 32 mj cm 2 for puv experiments batches of distilled water 2 5 l were spiked with 1 ml of the heat treated endospores while for lpuv experiments 25 l of tap water was spiked with 5 ml of the heat treated endospores to give a starting influent concentration of 6 log10 0 5 influent and effluent samples were analysed by triplicate in each run pre and post uv treatment via pour plate technique 1 ml using non selective nutrient agar biolab lennox dublin ireland as per standard methods 46 each uv output run was performed at least three times log inactivation was determined as the difference between log influent concentration n0 log effluent concentration n 2 4 statistical analysis as some of the data sets were not normally distributed and small in sample size it was decided to apply non parametric analysis the kruskal wallis test one way non parametric anova was used to determine significant differences between sample populations if the null hypothesis for the kruskal wallis test was rejected this was then followed by a post hoc dunn test for pairwise multiple comparisons to determine significant differences between sample populations analysis was carried out using ibm spss statistics 23 3 results and discussion 3 1 disinfection of bacillus spp endospores using lpuv and puv continuous flow through water systems with particular focus on influence of varying mnso4 h2o concentration in sporulation media studies were conducted to compare the disinfection efficacy of using lpuv and puv flow through water systems using pre determined numbers of b pumilus and b subtilis endospores bacillus endospores are more uv resistant than vegetative bacterial cells and have been used as surrogates for assessing uv reactor performance for the water industry 23 bacillus endospores are also used for monitoring important cross cutting disinfection and sterilisation processes including determining sterility assurance levels for the medical device sector however there is a commensurate dearth of knowledge on the potential influence of media formulation on this inactivation process in addition the broadspectrum output of the puv system was compared to a monochromatic lpuv system for potential enhanced germicidal properties of b pumilus endospores inactivation b subtilis endospores are currently the challenge microorganism of choice for uv reactor validation biodosimetry as per the dvgw drinking water standards protocol 12 b pumilus endospores are reported to exhibit a similar uv wavelength sensitivity to the highly resistant pathogen hadv and have been suggested as potential surrogate challenge organisms for hadv in uv reactor validation trials 16 17 19 however the artificial modification of endospore resistance via inorganic compound supplementation to emerging uv technologies has yet to be established findings on the impact of increasing mnso4 h2o concentrations 0 mm 0 05 mm 0 25 mm and 0 5 mm in culture agar media on the log inactivation of b pumilus endospores using a single puv output of 2 052 mj cm 2 are exhibited in fig 1 a results showed that 1 5 log inactivation of b pumilus endospores was observed using a concentration of 0 05 mm mnso4 h2o in comparison endospores cultivated in the absence of mnso4 h2o or 0 mm were inactivated by almost 2 log orders when treated at the same uv output the log inactivation at 0 mm mnso4 h2o was found to be significantly different p 0 05 to the two highest mnso4 h2o concentrations analysed 0 25 mm and 0 5 mm there appeared to be a saturation point for mnso4 h2o supplementation at 0 25 mm as no significant difference was found between log inactivations at 0 25 mm and 0 5 mm mnso4 h2o p 0 05 the impact of the mnso4 h2o agar supplementation for b pumilus endospores inactivation using lpuv at a single output of 20 mj cm 2 is shown in fig 1 b five concentrations of mnso4 h2o were analysed namely 0 mm 0 005 mm 0 05 mm 0 25 mm and 0 5 mm endospores cultivated in the absence of supplement mnso4 h2o were inactivated by 4 8 log in comparison the same endospores cultivated with the maximum concentration of 0 5 mm were inactivated by 2 2 log uv output of 20 mj cm 2 statistical analysis yielded similar results to those found with the puv system a significant difference was observed between endospore log inactivations at 0 mm and the two highest concentrations of 0 25 mm and 0 5 mm mnso4 h2o p 0 05 while no significant difference was found between the log inactivations at the two highest mnso4 h2o concentrations of 0 25 mm and 0 5 mm thus for both the puv and lpuv systems b pumilus endospores uv resistance appeared to be enhanced with the addition of minimal mnso4 h2o supplementation it was also clear that for both systems the 0 25 mm concentration appeared to be saturation point for mnso4 h2o supplementation and uv resistance thereofore this concentration was selected for use in the following experiments figs 2 a and 2 b illustrate the uv output response of b pumilus endospores post puv and lpuv treatment respectively in the absence of mnso4 h2o and those cultivated with agar supplemented with mnso4 h2o 0 25 mm the inactivation profiles of b pumilus endospores cultivated in the absence of mnso4 h2o supplement via puv and lpuv disinfection was carried out and results showed a puv output of approximately 2 052 mj cm 2 was required to inactivate b pumilus endospores by almost 2 log in a flow through system while a lpuv output of 12 mj cm 2 was required for the same inactivation level of 2 log complete inactivation of the endospores via lpuv disinfection was achieved at a uv output of approximately 30 mj cm 2 further detailed information is available in supplementary material figure s3 a and b for puv inactivation the impact of mnso4 h2o supplement on endospore uv resistance was observed to increase with the uv output applied lpuv results do not appear to follow the same trend a difference of 2 7 log inactivation was found at a uv output of 20 mj cm 2 while at the highest uv output approximately 30 mj cm 2 a difference of 2 log inactivation was found findings suggest cultivation agar supplemented with 0 25 mm mnso4 h2o has an impact on the uv resistance of b pumilus endospores in particular when inactivated using lpuv disinfection albeit higher disinfection rates were still observed than with the puv system the propagation of b subtilis endospores in the absence of mnso4 h2o was not possible in this study thus the minimum concentration of mnso4 h2o that could be applied while still cultivating b subtilis endospores was 0 005 mm this is likely to be attributed to the short propogation of endospores within ca 4 days on media supplemented with mnso4 h2o at above ambient temperatures in contrast to natural aging processes in agar that occurs after typically 7 to 10 days due to the conversion of vegetative bacteria to endospores as a consequence of nutrient deprivation build up of microbial waste products and reduction in water activity values there is very limited knowledge on the specific role of media formulation on triggering the conversion from vegetative to endospore state however recent studies have reported that maintaining levels of the chemical compound ca2 and pyridine 2 6 dicarboxylic acid dipicolinic acid dpa at 10 in the spore cortex appears critical as it has been shown to influence endospore resistance to environmental stresses and spore stability 47 48 thus it can be postulated that manganese sulphate monohydrate in part may influence the formation of this ca dpa and concentrations thereof in spores but this needs to be substantiated one function of ca dpa in spore resistance is to lower the core water content which may also function to protect the endospore dna by a variety of damaing agents including uv radiation 49 findings from this present study showed a similar log inactivation of b subtilis endospores at the two lowest mnso4 h2o concentrations no significant difference p 0 05 fig 3 a but a decrease in log inactivation efficiency of approximately 0 6 log when supplemented with 0 05 mm a similar result was found for b pumilus inactivation via puv fig 1 a a significant difference was found between the log inactivations at the two lowest concentrations in comparison to the other three higher concentrations p 0 05 for the lpuv system b subtilis did not appear to be as readily affected by mnso4 h2o supplement in comparison to b pumilus fig 3 b four concentrations of mnso4 h2o were investigated 0 005 mm 0 05 mm 0 25 mm and 0 5 mm a log inactivation difference of 0 7 was observed between 0 005 mm mnso4 h2o concentration and the 0 25 mm mnso4 h2o concentration whereas a difference of 2 log was found between the same ranges for the b pumilus experiments statistical analysis confirmed a significant difference p 0 05 in endospore inactivation at the lowest mnso4 h2o concentration 0 005 mm and the highest concentration mnso4 h2o concentration 0 5 mm but not at 0 25 mm indicating a decreased sensitivity of b subtilis endospores to mnso4 h2o supplementation in comparison to b pumilus for lpuv inactivation a uv response curve was generated for b subtilis endospore inactivation via both flow through puv and lpuv figs 4 a and 4 b the results of the puv experiments followed a similar trend to the b pumilus curve fig 2 a whereby as the uv output increased so too did the impact of the mnso4 h2o concentration on puv inactivation efficiency however overall b subtilis endospores appeared to be more readily inactivated via puv in comparison to b pumilus endospores at the maximum uv output of 2 052 mj cm2 b subtilis endospores were inactivated by 2 27 log and 1 53 log at 0 005 mm and 0 25 mm mnso4 h2o concentrations respectively in comparison b pumilus endospores were inactivated by 1 91 log and 1 34 log at 0 005 mm and 0 25 mm mnso4 h2o concentrations respectively the uv response curve of b subtilis endospores to lpuv disinfection at both low 0 005 mm and high 0 25 mm mnso4 h2o concentrations fig 4 b is notably different to the same analysis with b pumilus endospores fig 2 b b subtilis endospores were inactivated by 5 91 log at 0 005 mm mnso4 h2o at 25 mj cm2 at the same uv output the endospores were inactivated by 5 06 log when supplemented with 0 25 mm mnso4 h2o in contrast a difference of 2 56 log inactivation was found for b pumilus endospores when analysed at the same mnso4 h2o concentration and uv output these results are in agreement with those found in fig 3 b and further indicate b subtilis endospores are less affected by mnso4 h2o supplementation in terms of uv resistance when compared to b pumilus endospores 3 2 flow through uv system comparison for bacillus endospores inactivation 3 2 1 bacillus pumilus inactivation table 3 outlines the relevant literature to date investigating the inactivation of b pumilus endospores via both puv and lpuv disinfection in comparison to results found in this study to the best of our knowledge the inactivation of b pumilus endospores via pulsed uv disinfection in a flow through system has not previously been published in the literature moreover the results demonstrate that when 0 25 mm of mnso4 h2o was added to cultivation agar an increased uv output was required for the puv system to achieve a similar log inactivation to those endospores cultivated in the absence of mnso4 h2o supplement this finding is in agreement with results for lpuv system analysis previous research involving static puv disinfection reported a uv dose of 500 mj cm 2 to achieve a 3 log inactivation of the endospores on agar using the same strain of b pumilus endospores utilised in this study 50 the applied lower uv dose of 500 mj cm 2 which achieved a higher endospore log inactivation in comparison to this research may be attributed to puv set up static and or the disinfection medium e g agar or hard surfaces findings reported by levy et al 2012 showed higher endospore inactivation rates on polystyrene glass and aluminium surfaces in comparison to agar surfaces 50 in addition previous research has shown an increased puv output requirement for the inactivation of viruses in water via flow through puv in comparison to static puv while other studies have illustrated a difference in the inactivation mechanism of vegetative b subtilis cells when exposed to puv in either a dry or liquid state 42 51 the method of uv dose output measurement may also be an important consideration when comparing the literature garvey et al 2013 used chemical actinometry to determine the uv dose which measures the uv light absorbed by the sample and not uv light emitted by the system thus direct comparisons of uv dose output and endospore inactivation levels are often not possible 23 for lpuv disinfection using b pumilus endospores previous research appears to have been carried out via static system set up only whereby a collimated beam apparatus was used to disinfect continuously stirring water in a petri dish table 3 the lpuv doses required for endospore inactivation are higher in comparison to this study however the continually mixing flow through system may have aided endospore inactivation nevertheless despite the experimental set up the results for all of the lpuv studies in table 3 comparing the impact of mnso4 h2o supplement on the enhanced uv resistance of b pumilus are in agreement with the results found in this study whereby the addition of mnso4 h2o supplement aids endospore uv resistance 16 17 19 it is also clear from data presented in table 3 that the lpuv dose output response of b pumilus endospores tends to vary by strain it can also be concluded that b pumilus endospores exhibit a similar response to puv disinfection in comparison to lpuv disinfection whereby cultivation agar supplemented with mnso4 h2o enhances the uv resistance of the endospore in flow through systems 3 2 2 bacillus subtilis inactivation b subtilis endospores were less resistant to uv irradiation in comparison to b pumilus endospores when cultivated with both low and high mnso4 h2o concentrations when exposed to the puv system this may be due to differences in coat structure and or proteins it has been shown b subtilis spores are more resistant to pulsed irradiation when expressing proteins linked to coat formation in comparison to mutated strains where said proteins were absent 52 the spectral sensitivity of both strains differ with b subtilis endospores being most sensitive to wavelengths around 265 nm while b pumilus endospores are most sensitive to wavelengths at approximately 220 nm 18 53 spectral peaks of the puv system used in the study were observed at 247 nm and 260 nm therefore the uvc portion of the lamp output may favour inactivation of b subtilis endospores over b pumilus endospores the disinfection of b subtilis endospores in wastewater effluent via a flow through puv system has previously been reported however the applied uv dose output was not calculated rather the log reduction per flow rate was given in synthetic municipal wastewater effluent e g a flow rate of 8 l min resulted in a 3 89 log reduction 44 the authors completed a similar study investigating b subtilis endospore inactivation via static puv and in that study a broadband puv output of 2900 mj cm 2 was reported to give a 1 72 log inactivation 39 information on whether mnso4 h2o supplement was added to cultivation agar for both studies was not provided a similar study investigating the static puv disinfection of b subtilis endospores in suspension did report agar supplementation of 0 006 mm mnso4 h2o samples were subjected to puv doses of 500 mj cm 2 and 1000 mj cm 2 which reduced endospore counts by 1 1 log and 2 7 log respectively 21 the evaluation of puv disinfection efficiency of b subtilis endospores on a number of static surfaces agar polystyrene and glass was also investigated and reported a uv dose requirement of 500 mj cm2 to achieve a 3 log inactivation of the endospore on all three surfaces 50 moreover in depth analysis of the germicidal effectiveness of the puv broadspectrum applied confirmed the puv system to be almost completely ineffective against b subtilis endospores when uv wavelengths of 300 nm were removed from the treatment this result has been corroborated in other studies for the puv disinfection of b pumilus endospores listeria monocytogenes and listeria innocua 41 52 54 55 thus differences between inactivation results and puv dose output measurements within the literature underline the necessity to consider the method by which the uv dose output is determined for each system a lpuv output of 25 mj cm2 yielded a log inactivation of 5 91 when b subtilis endospores were cultivated with 0 005 mm mnso4 h2o supplement in contrast endospores cultivated in 0 25 mm mnso4 h2o illustrated a greater uv resistance with a log inactivation of 5 06 at the same uv output the inactivation of b subtilis endospores via lpuv disinfection has been widely reported perhaps due to its routine use as a challenge microorganism in uv reactor validation trials the strain atcc 6633 was chosen for this study as it has been widely analysed in the literature and hence may allow for greater intercomparisons a peer review of the literature by malayeri et al 2016 cited a total of 16 studies which met specific selection criteria for the investigation of b subtilis endospore inactivation via lpuv disinfection 56 to achieve a 2 log inactivation a uv dose range of between 15 mj cm2 and 48 mj cm2 was reported for all studies the majority of the studies did mention the use of sporulation mediums which would typically contain the supplement mnso4 h2o however the addition of mnso4 h2o to cultivation agar or broth was not specified in comparison this study observed that at a uv dose of 14 mj cm2 log inactivations of 3 71 and 2 24 were achieved when cultivation agar was supplemented with 0 005 mm and 0 25 mm mnso4 h2o respectively thus results are agreeable with those cited in the literature though in this study mnso4 h2o doses are indicated differences in endospore log inactivation depending on whether the endospores were cultivated in liquid or from the surface of agar have been reported previously bohrerova et al 2006 demonstrated that b subtilis endospores atcc 6633 cultivated in liquid broth required a lpuv dose 30 mj cm2 to yield a 1 log inactivation while those cultivated on agar required a lower dose of approximately 10 mj cm2 for the same log inactivation 57 as appears to be the case with b pumilus spores the lpuv sensitivity of b subtilis may also vary depending on the cultivation method applied while a typical xenon gas puv system is comprised of light emissions within the broadspectrum of uv visible and infrared light it may be an important consideration to prioritise pulsed uv dose output calculations in terms of biocidal puv dose output i e the energy applied from wavelengths below 300 nm ahead of the total puv dose output which infers the total energy applied across the whole broadspectrum output this has been previously demonstrated in a number of studies with the aid of spectrometers pyroelectric detectors and in some cases the uv dose output from puv systems is within the same order of magnitude as lpuv dose output outputs e g 1 100 mj cm2 35 36 55 in this study measurements indicated that only 26 of the lamp energy reached the sample at 900 v and a distance of 10 75 cm and of that only 8 was within the uv wavelength range table 2 the system type and the amount of uv energy produced by individual systems may also influence the uv dose output for example vimont et al 2015 illustrated that just 2 of the broadband energy was within the uv range which is in agreement with findings in this study which also found the uv power to account for 2 of the total broadspectrum output of the lamp recent research by gómez lópez bolton 2016 attempted to address the challenges associated with determining the exact pulsed uv dose delivered by suggesting a standard method for the uv fluence or dose measurement from puv disinfection systems in water by way of chemical actinometry methods 45 the protocol calls for energy calculations to be reported in terms of photon irradiance using the units einstein m2 s which may be better suited to the photobiological processes associated with polychromatic lamps however specific instrumentation and strict experimental set up is required as highlighted in table 3 there are various ways uv dose output can be measured and reported which can lead to disparities when comparing studies in the literature particularly in the case of puv system analysis furthermore some studies omit uv dose output calculations entirely and report only system specifications and experimental set up which may not always allow for direct comparisons to similar work these are important factors which should be noted when reporting analysis using uv systems rowan et al 1998 have previously studied the influence of variations in media formulation on bacterial physiology and subsequent tolerance to environmental stresses 58 62 it has been reported that the supplementation of growth media with the food additive maltodextrin augmented the diarrhoeal enterotoxin production in bacillus cereus 61 moreover variations in media formulation and storage have been shown to affect the virulence and pathogenesis of b cereus in hospitalised hiv patients enhancing the osmotic environment of culture media with increasing concentrations of glucose has also been proven to affect the tolerance of listeria monocytogenes to puv treatments 59 the specific mechanistic involvement of mnso4 h2o on enhanced endospore resistance to uv disinfection has yet to be elucidated but would be potentially unravelled by mapping gene transcripts using microarray and quantitative pcr the findings of this study highlight the need for international consensus on agreed standard methods in addition to a broader evaluation of the research to inform the validation of emerging technologies for water and adjacent food and pollination industries 63 65 puv has been adopted commercially for food packaging but has yet to be applied for other industrial applications on a large scale which may be attributed in part to lack of global harmonisation of metadata 58 66 this particular study highlights the need to consider a holistic inter laboratory study to assess the effectiveness of pulsed light where multi parameters and trials are conducted to validate its application for water treatment 63 franssen et al 67 recently highlighted this gap in the harmonisation of knowledge when it came to comparing the effectiveness of existing and emerging innovation for inactivating complex food borne parasites and their transmission stages 67 findings from this present study also supports the need for the development of appropriate risk assessment and predictive models that will help the uptake of new technologies for the water industry along with satisfying adjacent environmental policy and decision making needs 68 69 the aforementioned may explain why lpuv is still a preferred method of choice for the water industry over the past 50 years as it is a globally accepted technology supported by decades of validated disinfection data 4 conclusions this study showed that supplementing cultivation agar with mnso4 h2o to aid the sporulation of b pumilus and b subtilis enhanced their resistance to both puv and lpuv irradiation in flow through systems moreover the level of uv resistance increased significantly when relatively low concentrations 0 05 mm of mnso4 h2o were added to cultivation agar b pumilus endospores appeared to be more readily affected by the addition of the supplement in terms of increased uv resistance particularly in the case of lpuv disinfection in general b subtilis endospores were inactivated to a higher degree by the puv and lpuv systems in comparison b pumilus endospores the energy required by the puv system to inactivate both bacillus spp endospores was two orders of magnitude higher than the energy required by the lpuv this is in keeping with previous work whereby significantly higher energy outputs were necessary to achieve similar log inactivations of various microorganisms the flow through puv system appeared to offer no clear advantage over the lpuv in terms of bacterial endospore inactivation however further research is warranted in terms of whether the high energy pulses of the puv system might inhibit the photoreactivation of bacteria often associated with lpuv disinfection processes in addition studies are merited by way of optimising i the delivery of the pulsed uv light source in flow through applications and ii system configuration in terms of energy delivery it is recommended that future studies involving bacillus spp endospores and uv inactivation clarify whether manganese sulphate supplementation was applied during the cultivation stage and at what concentration to allow for stricter inter comparison in terms of uv requirements in the case of the puv system it is suggested that studies report full uv dose output details e g whether the reported uv dose output accounts for the full broadspectrum or the uv portion alone whether it is calculated or measured the number of pulses applied the pulse rate and energy per pulse in this way clear comparisons can be drawn between puv inactivation studies this study highlights the need to consider future harmonisation of data for puv and other emerging treatment technologies through pursuit of holistic multi parameter inter laboratory studies so as to validate these new innovations for uptake by the water industry acknowledgments the authors would

14461,water is a fragile resource consequently there is a pressing need to develop sustainable environmental friendly disinfection technologies this constitutes the first study to compare efficacy of continuous low pressure uv lpuv to that of pulsed uv light puv for uv disinfection performance in flow through water systems bacillus endospores were used as these are frequently deployed as biodosimeters for drinking water uv reactor validation protocols results showed a puv system output of 2 052 mj cm 2 energy below 300 nm was required for a 2 log inactivation of b pumilus endospores whereas a lower lpuv system output of 12 mj cm 2 produced a similar level of disinfection measurements of dose incident to the samples which were 10 75 cm from the puv light source showed supplementation of cultivation media with manganese sulphate monohydrate mnso4 h2o employed to enhance the rate of endospore formation for propagation was shown to increase the uv resistance of different bacillus spp to both irradiation approaches p 0 05 conventional lpuv light that is commonly used by the drinking water industry is a reliable and superior approach to puv which requires substantial modification for effective disinfection of continuous flow through water caution must also be exercised when manipulating media formulation to propagate endospores as this may lead to

ultraviolet uv treatment as a method of tertiary disinfection for drinking water treatment and for wastewater treatment has increased significantly worldwide in recent years 1 2 a key driver of this uptake may be attributed to its success of inactivating chlorine resistant pathogens in particular cryptosporidium parvum 3 4 uv treatment is also a physical disinfection method that is not associated with the formation of harmful disinfection by products e g trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids which are typically associated with free chlorines chloramines disinfection applications in addition advanced oxidation processes that utilise uv treatment in combination with other chemical treatments e g hydrogen peroxide are effective in the degradation of a number of organic pollutants 5 6 uv irradiation is effective at inactivating a variety of pathogens where uv dose or fluence mj cm 2 is defined as the uv intensity mw cm 2 multiplied by the exposure time s in a laboratory setting a collimated beam apparatus can be used to deliver a controlled amount of uv energy to receiving samples thus the uv dose may be accurately determined in contrast uv reactors installed at drinking water treatment plants may be subject to varying water flow dynamics varying influent water quality and varying uv intensities within the reactor due to lamp aging and fouling etc 7 10 these variations can in turn lead to inaccuracies when determining the exact uv dose delivered for this reason each uv reactor should undergo validation testing whereby biodosimetry is used to determine a reduction equivalent dose red from the reactor 7 11 13 the process involves measuring the inactivation of a robust or challenge microorganism after it has been exposed to uv light within the reactor and then comparing the inactivation level to a uv dose response curve of the same microorganism ascertained under controlled laboratory conditions using a collimated beam apparatus from this a red may be determined 14 there are three primary uv reactor validation guidelines protocols that are observed internationally the us environmental protection agency us epa uv disinfection guidance manual uvdgm the german association for gas water deutsche vereinigung des gas und wasserfaches dvgw w294 and the austrian standards institute österreichisches normungsinstitut önorm m 58373 1 7 12 13 the uvdgm is typically applied for uv reactor validation testing in north america however as a guideline document it does not set out one standard protocol but rather recommends validation protocols based on the type of water source to be treated and the target pathogen in question the red is determined using the biodosimetry of a surrogate challenge microorganism with a similar uv sensitivity to the specific target pathogen requiring inactivation e g ms2 bacteriophage may be used a surrogate organism for the inactivation of cryptosporidium 7 in europe the primary accepted protocols for uv reactor validation tend to be the önorm and the dvgw protocols both protocols stipulate that all uv reactors are required to supply a constant minimum uv dose of 40 mj cm 2 with the dvgw specifying bacillus subtilis endospores to be used as the challenge microorganism for biodosimetry analysis 12 13 bacillus endospores are commonly linked to uv disinfection studies b subtilis endospores have historically been used as pathogen surrogates in uv reactor validation trials as they are non pathogenic and exhibit an increased resistance to uv irradiation in comparison to most waterborne pathogens 7 15 b pumilus endospores have recently been suggested as suitable surrogates for the highly uv resistant waterborne pathogen human adenovirus hadv due to exhibiting similar levels of uv resistance 16 17 moreover studies have shown b pumilus endospores and hadv to be almost ten times more sensitive to uv irradiation at 220 nm in comparison to the standard 254 nm wavelength 18 19 thus its potential as a surrogate challenge organism for hadv in puv reactor validation trials is significant the cultivation of bacillus spp endospores in a laboratory typically involves the addition of supplement manganese sulphate monohydrate mnso4 h2o for rapid endospore propagation 20 a concentration of approximately 0 05 mm mnso4 h2o is recommended by the german national resource center dsmz for the sporulation of bacillus spp strains while a concentration of up to 0 1 mm mnso4 h2o has been applied in a number of research studies 16 18 21 27 recent studies have shown a relationship between bacillus spp endospores cultivated on agar supplemented with mnso4 h2o and increased uv resistance to lpuv disinfection 16 17 19 however little information is available regarding bacillus spp endospores cultivated on agar supplemented with mnso4 h2o and enhanced uv resistance to pulsed uv puv disinfection the modification of bacillus spp endospore uv resistance may be an important consideration in laboratory scale analysis particularly as bacillus subtilis endospores are currently the challenge organism of choice for uv system validation under dvgw regulations puv systems have been widely researched for application within the food industry and are characterised by high energy outputs and shorter contact times in comparison to standard lpuv disinfection systems 28 30 typically a polychromatic xenon lamp is used which emits light within the broadspectrum of the uv visible and infrared range 200 1100 nm with approximately 25 of the energy output in the uv spectrum 31 electricity is stored in a capacitor and released in extremely short pulses that lasts microseconds the frequency of pulses typically range between 1 and 10 pulses per second pps low pressure mercury lamps are reported to have a coefficient of efficiency ce of approximately 35 50 for the conversion of electrical energy to uv irradiation at 254 nm whereas high pressure pulsed lamps i e xenon lamps are reported to have a lower ce of approximately 10 15 32 33 in addition the power emitted from pulsed uv lamps is generally at least an order of magnitude higher than the power emitted from lpuv lamps table 1 compares the uv dose requirements of puv and lpuv systems for the log inactivation of various microorganisms the uv dose calculated for the puv systems typically includes the full polychromatic broadspectrum energy output in comparison to monochromatic energy output for lpuv systems at 254 nm some studies investigating puv disinfection efficiency include only the energy emitted from wavelengths in the uv range approximately 200 400 nm and calculate the uv output of the system accordingly while others include both the total broadband fluence dose and the uv fluence dose 34 36 flow through puv systems are relatively unexplored in the water wastewater disinfection sector but are noted as a promising alternative to lpuv as studies suggest high energy outputs may decrease contact times and inhibit photoreactivation 44 the use of xenon gas is considered more environmentally friendly than the standard mercury vapour lpuv lamps 30 however questions remain as to whether the intensity and or peak power of the applied puv fluence for water treatment applications has a considerable impact on microbial inactivation in comparison to lpuv applications a lack of clarity regarding how the uv dose for puv systems is determined can hinder replication studies and does not allow for direct comparisons 45 studies analysing lpuv systems which are set up as a continually mixing flow through system also appear to be limited such experimental set ups may aid comparisons to lpuv operations on site thus this study compared continuous lpuv and puv flow through irradiation systems for reliable and repeatable disinfection of bacillus endospores that were artificially grown and harvested from agar supplemented with manganese sulphate 2 materials and methods 2 1 puv system analysis a bench scale pulsed power source puv 01 samtech ltd glasgow was used to power a low pressure 60 kpa xenon filled flash lamp heraeus noblelight xap type nl4006 series constructed from a clear uv transparent quartz tube which produced a high intensity beam of polychromatic pulsed light 200 1100 nm a schematic figure of the system is available in the supplementary material figure s1 the lamp was placed 10 75 cm above a sterilised aluminium flow through vessel with a plan surface area of 290 cm 2 through which water was pumped at various flow rates corresponding to hydraulic residence times hrt being investigated hrts ranged between 65 s and 100 s the puv system allowed for the input voltage and the pulse rate to be varied between 400 and 1000 v and for a pulse frequency of between 0 1 and 10 pulses per second the uv output was determined by calculating the output voltage energy in combination with the sample distance from the xenon lamp the area of the vessel the pps and the hrt it is important to note that the adjustable factors listed as well as the type of sample medium influences the penetration of the puv light thus the energy delivered by the lamp is different to the energy received by the sample for example at 900 v 2pps and 100 s hrt the uv output was calculated to be 2052 mj cm 2 20 5 mw cm 2 112 mw cm 2 broadband output all puv outputs are presented to include only the wavelengths below 300 nm the total broadband dose received by the sample was analysed using a thermopile power detector model xlp12 3s h2 in gentec eo quebec canada in conjunction with integra software the detector 12 mm aperture was placed on the aluminium vessel 10 75 cm below the xenon lamp pulse energies were measured three times at each voltage setting after which an average value was obtained in addition two longpass colour glass filters fgl 400 and fgl 280 thorlabs gmbh dachau germany were also used to filter out the wavelengths emitted from the lamp below the uv range and below the uvc range respectively the filters were placed separately on top of the detector head and the power measurements were taken as previously described the differences in the power values obtained with and without the filters was used to calculate the power emitted from the lamp within the uv and the uvc range table 2 outlines the calculated total broadband puv power output per voltage setting and the measured puv dose as measured by the thermopile detector in addition to the measured uv and uvc power the uv filters were applied to 800 and 900 v settings only as these were the two voltage settings used throughout the experimental analysis 2 2 lpuv system analysis the continuous flow monochromatic lpuv system lcd 412 plus s i t a halpin hayward ltd had a fixed power output of 40 w at a uv c wavelength of 254 nm the uv output could be altered by varying the influent flow rate thereby altering the hrt which equated to exposure time the flow rates ranged between 11 l min and 27 l min which corresponded to hrts of between 1 66 s and 0 42 s to give a uv output range between 12 6 mj cm 2 and 31 9 mj cm 2 respectively the uv output was calculated using the rated energy of the system in addition a transmissivity sensor was also used to monitor uv transmittance which remained above 80 at all times a schematic figure of the system is available in the supplementary material figure s2 2 3 endospore analysis bacterial test strains dsm 492 bacillus pumilus and dsm 347 bacillus subtilis were sourced from the german national resource center dsmz braunschweig germany the strains were equivalent to atcc 27142 bacillus pumilus and atcc 6633 bacillus subtilis vegetative cells of both strains were cultivated on nutrient agar biolab lennox ireland at 35 c for 24 h to produce pure colonies one pure colony was inoculated into 100 ml tryptic soy broth sigma aldrich wicklow ireland and placed on a rotary shaker at 90 rpm for 24 h at 30 35 c after incubation 0 5 ml of the 24 hour culture was spread onto nutrient agar plates and incubated for at least four days at 30 35 c to encourage endospore production endospores cultivated in the presence of mnso4 h2o were spread onto nutrient agar plates which were supplemented with various mnso4 h2o honeywell sigma aldrich wicklow ireland concentrations ranging from 0 005 mm to 0 5 mm after incubation a sporulation rate of approximately 90 was achieved that was confirmed by endospore staining schaeffer and fulton spore stain kit sigma aldrich wicklow ireland using light microscopy endospores were collected by flooding the plate with 8 ml distilled water after which a sterile spreader was used to gather endospores from the seeded plates the water endospore emulsion was then aseptically transferred to a sterile 30 ml glass vial before being placed into a water bath at 80 c for 20 min to kill any remaining vegetative cells once heat treated endospores suspended in water were used in uv trials within 4 h b pumilus and b subtilis endospores were exposed in separate batches to a range of puv outputs from 0 to 2052 mj cm 2 and lpuv outputs from 12 to 32 mj cm 2 for puv experiments batches of distilled water 2 5 l were spiked with 1 ml of the heat treated endospores while for lpuv experiments 25 l of tap water was spiked with 5 ml of the heat treated endospores to give a starting influent concentration of 6 log10 0 5 influent and effluent samples were analysed by triplicate in each run pre and post uv treatment via pour plate technique 1 ml using non selective nutrient agar biolab lennox dublin ireland as per standard methods 46 each uv output run was performed at least three times log inactivation was determined as the difference between log influent concentration n0 log effluent concentration n 2 4 statistical analysis as some of the data sets were not normally distributed and small in sample size it was decided to apply non parametric analysis the kruskal wallis test one way non parametric anova was used to determine significant differences between sample populations if the null hypothesis for the kruskal wallis test was rejected this was then followed by a post hoc dunn test for pairwise multiple comparisons to determine significant differences between sample populations analysis was carried out using ibm spss statistics 23 3 results and discussion 3 1 disinfection of bacillus spp endospores using lpuv and puv continuous flow through water systems with particular focus on influence of varying mnso4 h2o concentration in sporulation media studies were conducted to compare the disinfection efficacy of using lpuv and puv flow through water systems using pre determined numbers of b pumilus and b subtilis endospores bacillus endospores are more uv resistant than vegetative bacterial cells and have been used as surrogates for assessing uv reactor performance for the water industry 23 bacillus endospores are also used for monitoring important cross cutting disinfection and sterilisation processes including determining sterility assurance levels for the medical device sector however there is a commensurate dearth of knowledge on the potential influence of media formulation on this inactivation process in addition the broadspectrum output of the puv system was compared to a monochromatic lpuv system for potential enhanced germicidal properties of b pumilus endospores inactivation b subtilis endospores are currently the challenge microorganism of choice for uv reactor validation biodosimetry as per the dvgw drinking water standards protocol 12 b pumilus endospores are reported to exhibit a similar uv wavelength sensitivity to the highly resistant pathogen hadv and have been suggested as potential surrogate challenge organisms for hadv in uv reactor validation trials 16 17 19 however the artificial modification of endospore resistance via inorganic compound supplementation to emerging uv technologies has yet to be established findings on the impact of increasing mnso4 h2o concentrations 0 mm 0 05 mm 0 25 mm and 0 5 mm in culture agar media on the log inactivation of b pumilus endospores using a single puv output of 2 052 mj cm 2 are exhibited in fig 1 a results showed that 1 5 log inactivation of b pumilus endospores was observed using a concentration of 0 05 mm mnso4 h2o in comparison endospores cultivated in the absence of mnso4 h2o or 0 mm were inactivated by almost 2 log orders when treated at the same uv output the log inactivation at 0 mm mnso4 h2o was found to be significantly different p 0 05 to the two highest mnso4 h2o concentrations analysed 0 25 mm and 0 5 mm there appeared to be a saturation point for mnso4 h2o supplementation at 0 25 mm as no significant difference was found between log inactivations at 0 25 mm and 0 5 mm mnso4 h2o p 0 05 the impact of the mnso4 h2o agar supplementation for b pumilus endospores inactivation using lpuv at a single output of 20 mj cm 2 is shown in fig 1 b five concentrations of mnso4 h2o were analysed namely 0 mm 0 005 mm 0 05 mm 0 25 mm and 0 5 mm endospores cultivated in the absence of supplement mnso4 h2o were inactivated by 4 8 log in comparison the same endospores cultivated with the maximum concentration of 0 5 mm were inactivated by 2 2 log uv output of 20 mj cm 2 statistical analysis yielded similar results to those found with the puv system a significant difference was observed between endospore log inactivations at 0 mm and the two highest concentrations of 0 25 mm and 0 5 mm mnso4 h2o p 0 05 while no significant difference was found between the log inactivations at the two highest mnso4 h2o concentrations of 0 25 mm and 0 5 mm thus for both the puv and lpuv systems b pumilus endospores uv resistance appeared to be enhanced with the addition of minimal mnso4 h2o supplementation it was also clear that for both systems the 0 25 mm concentration appeared to be saturation point for mnso4 h2o supplementation and uv resistance thereofore this concentration was selected for use in the following experiments figs 2 a and 2 b illustrate the uv output response of b pumilus endospores post puv and lpuv treatment respectively in the absence of mnso4 h2o and those cultivated with agar supplemented with mnso4 h2o 0 25 mm the inactivation profiles of b pumilus endospores cultivated in the absence of mnso4 h2o supplement via puv and lpuv disinfection was carried out and results showed a puv output of approximately 2 052 mj cm 2 was required to inactivate b pumilus endospores by almost 2 log in a flow through system while a lpuv output of 12 mj cm 2 was required for the same inactivation level of 2 log complete inactivation of the endospores via lpuv disinfection was achieved at a uv output of approximately 30 mj cm 2 further detailed information is available in supplementary material figure s3 a and b for puv inactivation the impact of mnso4 h2o supplement on endospore uv resistance was observed to increase with the uv output applied lpuv results do not appear to follow the same trend a difference of 2 7 log inactivation was found at a uv output of 20 mj cm 2 while at the highest uv output approximately 30 mj cm 2 a difference of 2 log inactivation was found findings suggest cultivation agar supplemented with 0 25 mm mnso4 h2o has an impact on the uv resistance of b pumilus endospores in particular when inactivated using lpuv disinfection albeit higher disinfection rates were still observed than with the puv system the propagation of b subtilis endospores in the absence of mnso4 h2o was not possible in this study thus the minimum concentration of mnso4 h2o that could be applied while still cultivating b subtilis endospores was 0 005 mm this is likely to be attributed to the short propogation of endospores within ca 4 days on media supplemented with mnso4 h2o at above ambient temperatures in contrast to natural aging processes in agar that occurs after typically 7 to 10 days due to the conversion of vegetative bacteria to endospores as a consequence of nutrient deprivation build up of microbial waste products and reduction in water activity values there is very limited knowledge on the specific role of media formulation on triggering the conversion from vegetative to endospore state however recent studies have reported that maintaining levels of the chemical compound ca2 and pyridine 2 6 dicarboxylic acid dipicolinic acid dpa at 10 in the spore cortex appears critical as it has been shown to influence endospore resistance to environmental stresses and spore stability 47 48 thus it can be postulated that manganese sulphate monohydrate in part may influence the formation of this ca dpa and concentrations thereof in spores but this needs to be substantiated one function of ca dpa in spore resistance is to lower the core water content which may also function to protect the endospore dna by a variety of damaing agents including uv radiation 49 findings from this present study showed a similar log inactivation of b subtilis endospores at the two lowest mnso4 h2o concentrations no significant difference p 0 05 fig 3 a but a decrease in log inactivation efficiency of approximately 0 6 log when supplemented with 0 05 mm a similar result was found for b pumilus inactivation via puv fig 1 a a significant difference was found between the log inactivations at the two lowest concentrations in comparison to the other three higher concentrations p 0 05 for the lpuv system b subtilis did not appear to be as readily affected by mnso4 h2o supplement in comparison to b pumilus fig 3 b four concentrations of mnso4 h2o were investigated 0 005 mm 0 05 mm 0 25 mm and 0 5 mm a log inactivation difference of 0 7 was observed between 0 005 mm mnso4 h2o concentration and the 0 25 mm mnso4 h2o concentration whereas a difference of 2 log was found between the same ranges for the b pumilus experiments statistical analysis confirmed a significant difference p 0 05 in endospore inactivation at the lowest mnso4 h2o concentration 0 005 mm and the highest concentration mnso4 h2o concentration 0 5 mm but not at 0 25 mm indicating a decreased sensitivity of b subtilis endospores to mnso4 h2o supplementation in comparison to b pumilus for lpuv inactivation a uv response curve was generated for b subtilis endospore inactivation via both flow through puv and lpuv figs 4 a and 4 b the results of the puv experiments followed a similar trend to the b pumilus curve fig 2 a whereby as the uv output increased so too did the impact of the mnso4 h2o concentration on puv inactivation efficiency however overall b subtilis endospores appeared to be more readily inactivated via puv in comparison to b pumilus endospores at the maximum uv output of 2 052 mj cm2 b subtilis endospores were inactivated by 2 27 log and 1 53 log at 0 005 mm and 0 25 mm mnso4 h2o concentrations respectively in comparison b pumilus endospores were inactivated by 1 91 log and 1 34 log at 0 005 mm and 0 25 mm mnso4 h2o concentrations respectively the uv response curve of b subtilis endospores to lpuv disinfection at both low 0 005 mm and high 0 25 mm mnso4 h2o concentrations fig 4 b is notably different to the same analysis with b pumilus endospores fig 2 b b subtilis endospores were inactivated by 5 91 log at 0 005 mm mnso4 h2o at 25 mj cm2 at the same uv output the endospores were inactivated by 5 06 log when supplemented with 0 25 mm mnso4 h2o in contrast a difference of 2 56 log inactivation was found for b pumilus endospores when analysed at the same mnso4 h2o concentration and uv output these results are in agreement with those found in fig 3 b and further indicate b subtilis endospores are less affected by mnso4 h2o supplementation in terms of uv resistance when compared to b pumilus endospores 3 2 flow through uv system comparison for bacillus endospores inactivation 3 2 1 bacillus pumilus inactivation table 3 outlines the relevant literature to date investigating the inactivation of b pumilus endospores via both puv and lpuv disinfection in comparison to results found in this study to the best of our knowledge the inactivation of b pumilus endospores via pulsed uv disinfection in a flow through system has not previously been published in the literature moreover the results demonstrate that when 0 25 mm of mnso4 h2o was added to cultivation agar an increased uv output was required for the puv system to achieve a similar log inactivation to those endospores cultivated in the absence of mnso4 h2o supplement this finding is in agreement with results for lpuv system analysis previous research involving static puv disinfection reported a uv dose of 500 mj cm 2 to achieve a 3 log inactivation of the endospores on agar using the same strain of b pumilus endospores utilised in this study 50 the applied lower uv dose of 500 mj cm 2 which achieved a higher endospore log inactivation in comparison to this research may be attributed to puv set up static and or the disinfection medium e g agar or hard surfaces findings reported by levy et al 2012 showed higher endospore inactivation rates on polystyrene glass and aluminium surfaces in comparison to agar surfaces 50 in addition previous research has shown an increased puv output requirement for the inactivation of viruses in water via flow through puv in comparison to static puv while other studies have illustrated a difference in the inactivation mechanism of vegetative b subtilis cells when exposed to puv in either a dry or liquid state 42 51 the method of uv dose output measurement may also be an important consideration when comparing the literature garvey et al 2013 used chemical actinometry to determine the uv dose which measures the uv light absorbed by the sample and not uv light emitted by the system thus direct comparisons of uv dose output and endospore inactivation levels are often not possible 23 for lpuv disinfection using b pumilus endospores previous research appears to have been carried out via static system set up only whereby a collimated beam apparatus was used to disinfect continuously stirring water in a petri dish table 3 the lpuv doses required for endospore inactivation are higher in comparison to this study however the continually mixing flow through system may have aided endospore inactivation nevertheless despite the experimental set up the results for all of the lpuv studies in table 3 comparing the impact of mnso4 h2o supplement on the enhanced uv resistance of b pumilus are in agreement with the results found in this study whereby the addition of mnso4 h2o supplement aids endospore uv resistance 16 17 19 it is also clear from data presented in table 3 that the lpuv dose output response of b pumilus endospores tends to vary by strain it can also be concluded that b pumilus endospores exhibit a similar response to puv disinfection in comparison to lpuv disinfection whereby cultivation agar supplemented with mnso4 h2o enhances the uv resistance of the endospore in flow through systems 3 2 2 bacillus subtilis inactivation b subtilis endospores were less resistant to uv irradiation in comparison to b pumilus endospores when cultivated with both low and high mnso4 h2o concentrations when exposed to the puv system this may be due to differences in coat structure and or proteins it has been shown b subtilis spores are more resistant to pulsed irradiation when expressing proteins linked to coat formation in comparison to mutated strains where said proteins were absent 52 the spectral sensitivity of both strains differ with b subtilis endospores being most sensitive to wavelengths around 265 nm while b pumilus endospores are most sensitive to wavelengths at approximately 220 nm 18 53 spectral peaks of the puv system used in the study were observed at 247 nm and 260 nm therefore the uvc portion of the lamp output may favour inactivation of b subtilis endospores over b pumilus endospores the disinfection of b subtilis endospores in wastewater effluent via a flow through puv system has previously been reported however the applied uv dose output was not calculated rather the log reduction per flow rate was given in synthetic municipal wastewater effluent e g a flow rate of 8 l min resulted in a 3 89 log reduction 44 the authors completed a similar study investigating b subtilis endospore inactivation via static puv and in that study a broadband puv output of 2900 mj cm 2 was reported to give a 1 72 log inactivation 39 information on whether mnso4 h2o supplement was added to cultivation agar for both studies was not provided a similar study investigating the static puv disinfection of b subtilis endospores in suspension did report agar supplementation of 0 006 mm mnso4 h2o samples were subjected to puv doses of 500 mj cm 2 and 1000 mj cm 2 which reduced endospore counts by 1 1 log and 2 7 log respectively 21 the evaluation of puv disinfection efficiency of b subtilis endospores on a number of static surfaces agar polystyrene and glass was also investigated and reported a uv dose requirement of 500 mj cm2 to achieve a 3 log inactivation of the endospore on all three surfaces 50 moreover in depth analysis of the germicidal effectiveness of the puv broadspectrum applied confirmed the puv system to be almost completely ineffective against b subtilis endospores when uv wavelengths of 300 nm were removed from the treatment this result has been corroborated in other studies for the puv disinfection of b pumilus endospores listeria monocytogenes and listeria innocua 41 52 54 55 thus differences between inactivation results and puv dose output measurements within the literature underline the necessity to consider the method by which the uv dose output is determined for each system a lpuv output of 25 mj cm2 yielded a log inactivation of 5 91 when b subtilis endospores were cultivated with 0 005 mm mnso4 h2o supplement in contrast endospores cultivated in 0 25 mm mnso4 h2o illustrated a greater uv resistance with a log inactivation of 5 06 at the same uv output the inactivation of b subtilis endospores via lpuv disinfection has been widely reported perhaps due to its routine use as a challenge microorganism in uv reactor validation trials the strain atcc 6633 was chosen for this study as it has been widely analysed in the literature and hence may allow for greater intercomparisons a peer review of the literature by malayeri et al 2016 cited a total of 16 studies which met specific selection criteria for the investigation of b subtilis endospore inactivation via lpuv disinfection 56 to achieve a 2 log inactivation a uv dose range of between 15 mj cm2 and 48 mj cm2 was reported for all studies the majority of the studies did mention the use of sporulation mediums which would typically contain the supplement mnso4 h2o however the addition of mnso4 h2o to cultivation agar or broth was not specified in comparison this study observed that at a uv dose of 14 mj cm2 log inactivations of 3 71 and 2 24 were achieved when cultivation agar was supplemented with 0 005 mm and 0 25 mm mnso4 h2o respectively thus results are agreeable with those cited in the literature though in this study mnso4 h2o doses are indicated differences in endospore log inactivation depending on whether the endospores were cultivated in liquid or from the surface of agar have been reported previously bohrerova et al 2006 demonstrated that b subtilis endospores atcc 6633 cultivated in liquid broth required a lpuv dose 30 mj cm2 to yield a 1 log inactivation while those cultivated on agar required a lower dose of approximately 10 mj cm2 for the same log inactivation 57 as appears to be the case with b pumilus spores the lpuv sensitivity of b subtilis may also vary depending on the cultivation method applied while a typical xenon gas puv system is comprised of light emissions within the broadspectrum of uv visible and infrared light it may be an important consideration to prioritise pulsed uv dose output calculations in terms of biocidal puv dose output i e the energy applied from wavelengths below 300 nm ahead of the total puv dose output which infers the total energy applied across the whole broadspectrum output this has been previously demonstrated in a number of studies with the aid of spectrometers pyroelectric detectors and in some cases the uv dose output from puv systems is within the same order of magnitude as lpuv dose output outputs e g 1 100 mj cm2 35 36 55 in this study measurements indicated that only 26 of the lamp energy reached the sample at 900 v and a distance of 10 75 cm and of that only 8 was within the uv wavelength range table 2 the system type and the amount of uv energy produced by individual systems may also influence the uv dose output for example vimont et al 2015 illustrated that just 2 of the broadband energy was within the uv range which is in agreement with findings in this study which also found the uv power to account for 2 of the total broadspectrum output of the lamp recent research by gómez lópez bolton 2016 attempted to address the challenges associated with determining the exact pulsed uv dose delivered by suggesting a standard method for the uv fluence or dose measurement from puv disinfection systems in water by way of chemical actinometry methods 45 the protocol calls for energy calculations to be reported in terms of photon irradiance using the units einstein m2 s which may be better suited to the photobiological processes associated with polychromatic lamps however specific instrumentation and strict experimental set up is required as highlighted in table 3 there are various ways uv dose output can be measured and reported which can lead to disparities when comparing studies in the literature particularly in the case of puv system analysis furthermore some studies omit uv dose output calculations entirely and report only system specifications and experimental set up which may not always allow for direct comparisons to similar work these are important factors which should be noted when reporting analysis using uv systems rowan et al 1998 have previously studied the influence of variations in media formulation on bacterial physiology and subsequent tolerance to environmental stresses 58 62 it has been reported that the supplementation of growth media with the food additive maltodextrin augmented the diarrhoeal enterotoxin production in bacillus cereus 61 moreover variations in media formulation and storage have been shown to affect the virulence and pathogenesis of b cereus in hospitalised hiv patients enhancing the osmotic environment of culture media with increasing concentrations of glucose has also been proven to affect the tolerance of listeria monocytogenes to puv treatments 59 the specific mechanistic involvement of mnso4 h2o on enhanced endospore resistance to uv disinfection has yet to be elucidated but would be potentially unravelled by mapping gene transcripts using microarray and quantitative pcr the findings of this study highlight the need for international consensus on agreed standard methods in addition to a broader evaluation of the research to inform the validation of emerging technologies for water and adjacent food and pollination industries 63 65 puv has been adopted commercially for food packaging but has yet to be applied for other industrial applications on a large scale which may be attributed in part to lack of global harmonisation of metadata 58 66 this particular study highlights the need to consider a holistic inter laboratory study to assess the effectiveness of pulsed light where multi parameters and trials are conducted to validate its application for water treatment 63 franssen et al 67 recently highlighted this gap in the harmonisation of knowledge when it came to comparing the effectiveness of existing and emerging innovation for inactivating complex food borne parasites and their transmission stages 67 findings from this present study also supports the need for the development of appropriate risk assessment and predictive models that will help the uptake of new technologies for the water industry along with satisfying adjacent environmental policy and decision making needs 68 69 the aforementioned may explain why lpuv is still a preferred method of choice for the water industry over the past 50 years as it is a globally accepted technology supported by decades of validated disinfection data 4 conclusions this study showed that supplementing cultivation agar with mnso4 h2o to aid the sporulation of b pumilus and b subtilis enhanced their resistance to both puv and lpuv irradiation in flow through systems moreover the level of uv resistance increased significantly when relatively low concentrations 0 05 mm of mnso4 h2o were added to cultivation agar b pumilus endospores appeared to be more readily affected by the addition of the supplement in terms of increased uv resistance particularly in the case of lpuv disinfection in general b subtilis endospores were inactivated to a higher degree by the puv and lpuv systems in comparison b pumilus endospores the energy required by the puv system to inactivate both bacillus spp endospores was two orders of magnitude higher than the energy required by the lpuv this is in keeping with previous work whereby significantly higher energy outputs were necessary to achieve similar log inactivations of various microorganisms the flow through puv system appeared to offer no clear advantage over the lpuv in terms of bacterial endospore inactivation however further research is warranted in terms of whether the high energy pulses of the puv system might inhibit the photoreactivation of bacteria often associated with lpuv disinfection processes in addition studies are merited by way of optimising i the delivery of the pulsed uv light source in flow through applications and ii system configuration in terms of energy delivery it is recommended that future studies involving bacillus spp endospores and uv inactivation clarify whether manganese sulphate supplementation was applied during the cultivation stage and at what concentration to allow for stricter inter comparison in terms of uv requirements in the case of the puv system it is suggested that studies report full uv dose output details e g whether the reported uv dose output accounts for the full broadspectrum or the uv portion alone whether it is calculated or measured the number of pulses applied the pulse rate and energy per pulse in this way clear comparisons can be drawn between puv inactivation studies this study highlights the need to consider future harmonisation of data for puv and other emerging treatment technologies through pursuit of holistic multi parameter inter laboratory studies so as to validate these new innovations for uptake by the water industry acknowledgments the authors would

composite cofe2o4 ac was prepared by a facile one step low temperature refluxing route the obtained material was characterized by x ray diffraction fourier transform infrared spectroscopy brunauer emmett teller surface area method and vibrating sample magnetometer techniques respectively the composite was tested as an adsorbent for the removal of gentian violet gv the adsorption process was investigated as the functions of ionic strength temperature solution ph adsorbent dosage contact time and initial gv concentration the equilibrium adsorption data fitted well to the langmuir model and the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 184 2 mg g 1 at 303 k the remarkable adsorption capacity of gv onto cofe2o4 ac was attributed to strong π π interaction and weak electrostatic attraction between gv and cofe2o4 ac the thermodynamic analysis suggested that the adsorption of gv on cofe2o4 ac was a spontaneous physical and endothermic process the adsorption processes could be described by the pseudo second order kinetic model the whole adsorption process was jointly controlled by external mass transfer and intraparticle diffusion magnetic cofe2o4 ac with adsorbed gv could be regenerated using acidic ethanol solution and was separable from liquid media using a magnetic field keywords cofe2o4 activated carbon composite gentian violet magnetic composite adsorption 1 introduction gentian violet also known as crystal violet cv is a triphenylmethane dye used extensively in textile paper and printing ink industries and also used as a biological stain bacteriostatic agent in veterinary medicine and skin disinfectant in humans 1 2 consequently high concentration of gv is always present in industrial wastewaters 3 however gv is harmful by inhalation ingestion as well as through skin adsorption 4 it may cause cancer and severe eye irritation in human beings 5 the presence of gv in the aqueous water system is considered to pose a risk to human health it is necessary to treat gv contaminated wastewater prior to its discharge to the environment 6 the major techniques applied for water purification include adsorption ion exchange flocculation photo dissociation ultrafiltration and membrane process 7 12 adsorption is one of the most effective and economic techniques this technique can handle fairly large flow rates producing a high quality effluent that does not result in the formation of harmful substances such as ozone and free radicals 13 14 different adsorbents have been utilized to remove the wastewaters containing gv aboelfetoh et al reports a facile method for the synthesis of reduced graphene oxide rgo cuχo nanohybrids by the hydrothermal method under diverse cu ii loading and alkali concentrations in the absence of an extra reducing agent the nanohybrids were utilized as adsorbents for the removal of methyl blue mb and crystal violet cv as models of anionic and cationic dyes 15 martins et al oxidized cellulose cel and sugarcane bagasse sb with an h3po4 nano2 mixture to obtain adsorbent materials with high contents of carboxylic groups the optimized synthesis conditions yielded cox and sbox with 4 8 mmol g and 4 5 mmol g of carboxylic acid groups respectively the materials produced oxidized cellulose cox and oxidized sugarcane bagasse sbox were used for the removal of the model cationic dyes cv and auramine o ao from aqueous solution 16 brião et al investigated a mesoporous zsm 5 zeolite synthetized using chitin as template for the removal of cv from aqueous solution 17 yao et al prepared porous magnetic polyacrylamide microspheres for efficient removal of cationic dyes by a simple polymerization induced phase separation method which showed perfect magnetic separation performance and a high adsorption capacity for mb neutral red nr and gv from aqueous solution 18 bellir et al prepared an activated bentonite by mixing bentonite with concentrated sulfiric acid at 60 c for 2 h and investigated its adsorption property toward gv from an aqueous solution 19 among these adsorbents low adsorption capacities harsh preparation conditions or expensive cost may limit their application in large scale cofe2o4 is a promising material owing to its magnetic properties such as strong anisotropy high coercivity at room temperature moderate saturation magnetization and good mechanical and chemical stabilities 20 21 it is extensively used in a variety of applications including high density information storage 22 lithium ion batteries 23 and magnetic drug delivery 24 recently cofe2o4 based composite adsorbent has attracted people s attention due to economic consideration and favorable dynamic property and has been used for wastewater treatment for example zhou et al developed a facile one pot synthetic route to decorate carbon nanotubes with nh2 functionalized superparamagnetic cofe2o4 nanoparticles for improved surface functionalization 25 the resulting magnetic composites exhibited better adsorption properties for tetrabromobisphenol a and pb ii rouby s group produced cnts decorated with cofe2o4 nanoparticles for the removal of methyl green dye from aqueous solutions 26 li et al synthesized magnetic cofe2o4 functionalized graphene sheets cofe2o4 fgs nanocomposites by hydrothermal treatment of inorganic salts and thermal exfoliated graphene sheets which had great potential as an effective absorbent for removing methyl orange in water 27 ai et al synthesized montmorillonite cofe2o4 and cofe2o4 activated carbon cofe2o4 ac composites by a simple one step refluxing route and their adsorption properties were investigated as magnetic adsorbents for the removal of mb and malachite green dye from wastewaters 28 29 among the cofe2o4 based composite adsorbents mentioned above cofe2o4 ac composite has remarkable affinity toward organic and inorganic contaminants in water 30 however to best of our knowledge few works using cofe2o4 ac composite as an adsorbent were reported 29 30 here we introduced cofe2o4 particles into the pores of activated carbon ac by a facile one step low temperature refluxing route the obtained cofe2o4 ac composite was characterized by x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy brunauer emmett teller bet surface area method and vibrating sample magnetometer vsm techniques respectively the composite was used to remove gv in water solution the adsorption process was investigated as the function of ionic strength temperature solution ph adsorbent dosage contact time and initial gv concentration the characteristics of the adsorption isotherm thermodynamics and kinetics were also studied through the adsorption experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials activated carbon ac powder sodium hydroxide naoh and ferric nitrate fe no3 3 9h2o were purchased from tianjin tianli chemical reagent comp ltd china cobalt ii nitrate co no3 2 6h2o and gentian violet gv were obtained from tianjin kermel chemical reagent co ltd china a stock solution of gv 5 00 10 3 mg l 1 was prepared by dissolving 0 500 g of gv in 100 ml water all the gv solutions used in the adsorption experiments were prepared by diluting the stock solution to the required concentrations with water twice distilled water was used throughout the experiments all the chemical reagents were of analytical grade without further purification 2 2 preparation of cofe2o4 accomposite approximately 25 g ac was soaked in 5 mol l 1 hcl for 24 h and then thoroughly washed with water until constant ph of the washed liquid was achieved the treated ac was dried in oven at 110 c for 4 h and then stored in a cacl2 desiccator until used in the experiments 31 cofe2o4 ac composite was prepared by a facile one step low temperature refluxing route 29 a proportion of the treated ac was added into a 150 ml alkaline solution containing 3 4 g naoh and stirred at room temperature for 30 min to get ac suspension the suspension was maintained at 373 k to keep it at slightly boiling state and then 50 ml metal nitrate solution containing 5 4944 g fe no3 3 9h2o 1 360 10 2 mol and 1 9790 g co no3 2 6h2o 6 799 10 3 mol was poured as quickly as possible into the above boiling suspension under stirring the amount of ac was adjusted in order to obtain cofe2o4 ac composite with weight ratio of 1 3 the mixture solution was refluxed at 373 k for 2 h after the reaction was complete the resulting cofe2o4 ac composites were collected by an external magnet washed with water several times and dried at 353

cofe2o4 gv cofe2o4 ac and cofe2o4 ac gv cofe2o4 ac composite after adsorption of gv in aqueous solution in the range 4000 400 cm 1 were recorded by fourier infrared spectrometer ft ir equinx55 brucher using kbr pellet technique the ph at which the adsorbent surface charge takes a zero value is defined as point of zero charge phpzc at this ph the charge of the positive surface sites is equal to that of the negative ones the phpzc of cofe2o4 ac composite was determined by a mass titration method 33 various amounts of cofe2o4 ac composite samples were put into 10 ml of 0 10 mol l 1 kno3 solutions prepared with boiled water the bottles were sealed and shaken overnight the equilibrium ph values of the mixtures were measured and the limiting ph was taken as the phpzc the ph values were determined by a ph meter phs 25 rex electric chemical china the magnetic properties of cofe2o4 and cofe2o4 ac were measured by vibrating sample magnetometer at room temperature vsm lake shore 6653 usa the bet n2 method was used to determine the specific surface areas and pore structure of ac cofe2o4 and cofe2o4 ac using a micromeritics asap 2020 analyzer micromeritics instrument co usa 2 4 batch adsorption experiments adsorption studies were carried out in a batch model using a thermostated shaker changzhou guohua electric appliance comp ltd china the gv solutions with initial concentrations from 50 to 350 mg l 1 were used for batch adsorption experiments for each run a certain amount of cofe2o4 ac composite and 100 ml of gv solution were transferred in a flask and agitated in a temperature controlled shaker with a constant speed of 200 rpm at different ph and contact time at predetermined time intervals 5 ml of dispersion was drawn and separated immediately by an adscititious magnet to collect adsorbent the supernate containing residual gv was determined at 584 nm using tu 1901 double beam uv vis spectrophotometer beijing general instrument co ltd china 18 the dyes concentration was calculated from a calibration curve of absorbance versus dye concentration all determinations were performed in triplicate per experiment because asorption depends on various factors like the contact time ph ionic strength and temperature the influences of such factors were studied the ph of the gv solution was adjusted by adding negligible volumes of 0 1 mol l 1 hcl or naoh solution to explore the impact of ionic strength on gv removal gv solutions containing different concentrations of kno3 were used the amount of adsorbed gv qt mg g 1 on adsorbents at a given time t min and removal efficiency r were calculated as eqs 2 and 3 2 q t c 0 c t v m 3 r c 0 c e c 0 100 where c 0 ct and c e mg l 1 are gv concentrations at the begeinning at a given time t and at equilibrium respectively v l is the initial solution volume and m g is the adsorbent weight 2 5 desorption experiments desorption studies were also conducted in the batch mode similar to adsorption studies 0 10 g cofe2o4 ac adsorbents were added to 100 ml of dye solutions 100 mg l 1 with contact time of 190 min at 303 k the dye loaded cofe2o4 ac adsorbents were separated from their aqueous solutions by an adscititious magnet and washed with distilled water in order to remove the unadsorbed traces of gv regeneration of exhausted cofe2o4 ac saturated with gv was conducted by using the solvent desorption technique these dye loaded cofe2o4 ac adsorbents were brought into contact with 20 ml of a mixture of hcl 0 01 mol l 1 solution and anhydrous ethanol 5 5 v v and the suspensions were shaken for 20 min at 298 k with a shaking speed of 200 rpm after desorption the adsorbent was magnetically separated washed with water and dried in an oven at 378 k for the next cycle to test the reusability of the adsorbent described adsorption desorption cycle was repeated several times with the same adsorbent the amount of adsorbed gv q e mg g 1 on adsorbents at equilibrium was calculated as eq 4 4 q e c 0 c e v m 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the adsorbent fig 1 shows the xrd patterns of cofe2o4 cofe2o4 ac and ac all peaks were normalized according to the maximum peak the diffraction peaks in fig 1 a can be perfectly indexed to the cubic spinel structure jcpds card no 22 1086 and no characteristic peaks of impurities are detected in the xrd pattern implying the formation of the single phase spinel 27 the observed diffraction peaks are broad and less sharp indicating as prepared cofe2o4 particles with small dimensions as shown in fig 1 b the xrd pattern of cofe2o4 ac is almost identical to that of the cofe2o4 particles while the peak intensity of cofe2o4 decreases in the presence of ac which is due to part of cofe2o4 particles being incorporated inside the pores of ac 34 the average crystallite sizes of bare cofe2o4 particles and cofe2o4 particles in cofe2o4 ac composite were calculated using the scherrer formula to be 21 81 and 27 22 nm respectively it is obvious that the average crystallite size of cofe2o4 particles in cofe2o4 ac composite is slightly bigger than that of bare cofe2o4 particles this result implies that the crystallite structure of cofe2o4 particles may not change in the presence of ac the ft ir spectra of cofe2o4 cofe2o4 ac cofe2o4 ac gv cofe2o4 ac composite after adsorption of gv in aqueous solution ac and gv are depicted in fig 2 as for the spectrum of cofe2o4 the stronger absorption peak at 596 cm 1 is characteristic of fe o bond stretching vibration fig 2 a 35 the adsorption peak at 596 cm 1 also appears in the ft ir spectrum of cofe2o4 ac composite fig 2 b which demonstrates that the presence of ac almost has no effect on the crystallite structure of cofe2o4 a weak adsorption peak at 1090 cm 1 shown in the ft ir spectrum of ac fig 2 d belongs to the symmetric stretching vibration of coc group the weak adsorption peak of coc group decreases obviously in the ft ir spectrum of cofe2o4 ac fig 2 b which may be explained by the forming of coo or feo coordination bonds between oxygen atoms of coc groups and cofe2o4 36 two peaks observed at 1170 and 1587 cm 1 are characteristic of the c n and cc stretching vibration of aromatic ring fig 2 e these bands also appear in the ft ir spectrum of cofe2o4 ac gv fig 2 c which suggests that gv has been adsorbed onto cofe2o4 ac composite the magnetization measurements of cofe2o4 and cofe2o4 ac were carried out using a vibrating sample magnetometer vsm at room temperature with an applied magnetic field of 8 koe as can be seen in fig 3 both samples show ferromagnetic behavior the saturation magnetization ms remnant magnetization mr and coercivity hc values of cofe2o4 and cofe2o4 ac are 47 4 emu g 1 2 9 emu g 1 and 25 5 oe and 15 6 emu g 1 0 4 emu g 1 and 45 5 oe respectively table 1 in contrast the ms and mr values of cofe2o4 ac are smaller than those of cofe2o4 which may be attributed to the presence of non magnetic ac in the magnetic composite 37 nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms and the pore size distributions of cofe2o4 cofe2o4 ac and ac are shown in fig 4 a1 a3 and 4b all the samples exhibit type iv isotherms definition by iupac which is acharacteristic of mesoporous materials isotherms of cofe2o4 fig 4a1 also exhibits an h2 type hysteresis at the relative pressure p p 0 between 0 4 and 0 9 which is indicative of ink bottle shaped pores 38 the isotherm of the cofe2o4 ac composite is quite close to that of ac fig 4a2 and 4a3 both isotherms exhibit an h3 type hysteresis at high relative pressure which is typical of activated carbon due to the presence of slit shaped pores 39 the data of the bet surface area pore volume and average pore diameter of bare cofe2o4 cofe2o4 ac and ac are listed in table 2 average pore diameter distribution curves were estimated from the adsorption isotherms using bareett joyner halenda bjh the specific surface area and pore volume of cofe2o4 calculated using the bet equation are 109 9 m2 g 1 and 0 189 cm3 g 1 respectively as compared with ac and cofe2o4 ac bare cofe2o4 possesses the lowest surface area and pore volume the average pore diameters for cofe2o4 cofe2o4 ac and ac are 7 784 3 858 and 3 896 nm respectively the average diameters of all the samples are in the range 2 10 nm which belongs to mesopores the bet surface areas for cofe2o4 cofe2o4 ac and ac are 109 9 268 7 and 287 4 m2 g 1 respectively compared with bare cofe2o4 and ac the average pore diameter bet surface area and average pore diameter of cofe2o4 ac composite are quite close to those of ac these results indicate that the mesoporous structure of ac may not change in the presence of cofe2o4 and imply that the surface of cofe2o4 ac composite mainly consists of ac through co o or fe o coordination bonds cofe2o4 particles are attached to the pores of ac 3 2 effect of experimental conditions 3 2 1 effect of ionic strength electrostatic interactions are divided into two types electrostatic attraction and electrostatic repulsion theoretically when the electrostatic interaction between the adsorbent surface and adsorbate ions is attractive an increase in ionic strength will decrease the adsorption capacity conversely when the electrostatic interaction is repulsive an increase in ionic strength will increase adsorption 16 in order to test the effect of ionic strength on the adsorption of gv 100 mg l 1 gv solutions ph 10 2 containing different concentrations of kno3 were used for adsorption experiment as shown in fig 5 a the removal efficiency of gv doesn t change significantly with increasing concentration of kno3 in the range 0 1 0 mol l 1 indicating that ionic strength almost has no significant effect on the adsorption of gv onto cofe2o4 ac composite this result demonstrates that the adsorption of gv onto cofe2o4 ac composite isn t be controlled by the electrostatic interaction hydrogen bonds or π π interaction may play a main role in gv adsorption 40 3 2 2 effect of adsorption temperature the temperature has great negative effect on the adsorption quantity if hydrogen bonds are the main adsorption mechanism in the adsorption process the effect of temperature on the removal efficiency of gv was investigated in the temperature from 293 k to 318 k and the results are shown in fig 5b the removal efficiency of gv increases rapidly with increasing temperature from 293 k to 303 k when the temperature is higher than 303 k the removal efficiency of gv rises slowly this result indicates that hydrogen bonds may not be the main interaction of gv absorbed on cofe2o4 ac composite 41 the π π interaction may play a main role in gv adsorption 42 3 2 3 effect of ph on dye adsorption the solution ph is an important factor for adsorption process it affects both aqueous chemistry and surface binding sites of the adsorbent 43 and is related with structural changes of dye molecule 44 the effect of solution ph on the adsorption of dye was investigated in ph range from 4 5 to 11 5 as shown in fig 6 a the removal efficiency of gv increases from 82 to 95 with the increase of ph from 4 5 to 10 2 and the highest removal efficiency of gv was obtained at ph 10 2 in aqueous solution gv is present in two forms cationic form gv and gv leucocarbinol both forms are converted into each other the equilibrium being ph dependent scheme 1 45 46 the phpzc of cofe2o4 ac determined by using mass titration method is 9 7 fig 6b at ph values lower than 9 7 gv predominantly presents as cationic form gv and the surface of cofe2o4 ac composite is also positively charged the adsorption of gv on cofe2o4 ac is mainly attributed to strong π π interaction between bulk π systems on cofe2o4 ac surfaces and cc group or benzene rings of gv 47 48 in the ph range 9 7 10 2 gv still predominantly presents as cationic form gv while the surface of cofe2o4 ac composite is negatively charged higher removal efficiency of gv observed in the ph range 9 7 10 2 is due to strong π π interaction and weak electrostatic attraction between cofe2o4 ac and gv as solution ph is changed from 10 2 to 11 5 the removal efficiency decreases from 95 to 92 the slight decrease of removal efficiency may be because part of gv is converted into its non ionized form gv leucocarbinol 49 50 gv is a propeller shaped molecule with a quasi planar structure while gv leucocarbinol is a non planar molecule 51 as compared with gv gv leucocarbinol isn t readily absorbed on ac 52 53 this phenomenon can be explained by relatively weaker π π plane to plane interaction between non planar aromatic adsorbates and bulk π systems of ac 54 55 in addition the hydrogen bonding interaction between oh group of gv leucocarbinol and water might also decrease the adsorption of gv leucocarbinol onto cofe2o4 ac 56 3 2 4 effect of amount of adsorbent the effect of adsorbent dosage on gv removal was examined in the range 0 2 1 4 g l 1 fig 7 the results show that the removal efficiency of dye sharply increases with increasing amount of the adsorbents in the range 0 2 1 0 g l 1 the increase in the removal efficiency is due to the increase in active sites on the adsorbent and thus making easier penetration of gv dye to the adsorption sites 57 when the adsorbent exceeds 1 0 g l 1 the removal efficiency almost reaches a constant value thus an optimal adsorbent dosage for gv adsorption was found to be 1 0 g l 1 3 2 5 effects of contact time and initial concentration effects of contact time and gv initial concentration on the absorption of gv were studied and the results are showed in fig 8 a the adsorption capacities of cofe2o4 ac increase rapidly in the initial stages of contact time and then slow down gradually until they attain equilibrium for the concentration of 100 mg l 1 gv the adsorption capacity of cofe2o4 ac increases rapidly in the initial stage of 40 min and reaches equilibrium at 180 min the fast removal rate during the initial stage may be attributed to the rapid diffusion of gv from the bulk solution to the external surfaces of cofe2o4 ac as the sites being gradually occupied the adsorbed gv tends to be transported from the bulk phase to the actual sorption sites i e inner sphere pores of cofe2o4 ac such slow diffusion process will decrease the sorption rate of gv at later stages 58 effect of initial gv concentration on the adsorption by cofe2o4 ac was explored at three different initial concentrations of gv 100 200 and 300 mg l 1 as shown in fig 8a the adsorption capacities of gv by cofe2o4 ac at a given time and at equilibrium all increase with increasing the initial dye concentration the increase of the adsorption capacities of gv with increasing the initial gv concentration could be attributed to an increase in the driving force of concentration gradient with an increase in the initial gv concentration 59 thus it is clear that the adsorption process is highly dependent on initial gv concentration and contact time the contact time of 190 min and initial gv concentration of 100 mg l 1 were selected in the subsequent experiments 3 3 adsorption kinetics to investigate the adsorption mechanism of gv onto cofe2o4 ac composite two kinetic models pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were tested to find the best fitted model for the experimental data the pseudo first order kinetic model can be defined as eq 5 5 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t where k 1 min 1 is the rate constant of pseudo first order kinetic adsorption the values of k 1 and q e can be determined from the slope and intercept of the plot respectively the pseudo second order kinetic model can be presented in eq 6 6 t q t 1 q e 2 k 2 t q e where k 2 g mg 1 min 1 is the rate constant of the pseudo second order kinetic adsorption the kinetic parameters in both models were determined from linear plots of log q e qt versus t for the pseudo first order kinetic model fig 8b and t qt versus t for the pseudo second order kinetic model fig 8c the adsorption rate constants calculated for both kinetic models are summarized in table 3 the correlation coefficients r 2 for the pseudo first order kinetic model are relatively low and the calculated q e values q e cal from the pseudo first order kinetic model do not agree with the experimental data q e exp indicating that the adsorption process does not follow the pseudo first order kinetic adsorption expression for the pseudo second order kinetic model the r 2 values are higher than 0 999 and the q e cal values agree well with the q e exp values which indicates that the pseudo second order kinetic model is feasible to describe the adsorption process of gv on cofe2o4 ac to test the diffusion mechanism between gv molecule and cofe2o4 ac an intra particle diffusion model proposed by weber and morris was used the linearized intraparticle diffusion model is given as eq 7 60 7 q t k i t 0 5 c where k i mg g 1 min 0 5 is the intra particle diffusion rate constant and c value mg g 1 represents a constant depicting resistance to mass transfer in the boundary layer the k i and c were calculated from the slope and intercept of lines obtained from plots of qt versus t 0 5 generally the adsorption in this model involves following steps 1 bulk diffusion 2 film diffusion 3 intraparticle diffusion and 4 chemical reaction via ion exchange or the adsorption of adsorbate at an active site on the surface of adsorbent 61 if the regression of qt versus t 0 5 is linear and passes through the origin intraparticle diffusion is the sole rate limiting step 62 plots of qt against t 0 5 with different gv concentrations are shown in fig 8d the values of k i and c are listed in table 4 it is found that all the plots have two linear portions this feature indicates that more than one mode of adsorption is involved the first linear portion includes the adsorption period of 0 64 min which represents external mass transfer the second linear portion includes the adsorption period of 64 180 min representing intraparticle diffusion the second linear portions do not cross the origin c 0 suggesting that intraparticle diffusion is not the only rate controlling step and the external mass transfer is also occurring simultaneously the overall adsorption process may be jointly controlled by external mass transfer and intraparticle diffusion 63 as shown in table 4 the intra particle diffusion rate constant k i2 increases from 0 316 mg g 1 min 0 5 to 2 319 mg g 1 min 0 5 with the increasing initial dye concentration from 100 mg l 1 to 300 mg l 1 this observation shows faster intra particle diffusion at higher initial concentrations for the same linear section the value of c increases from 88 6 mg g 1 to 161 9 mg g 1 when the initial gv concentration increases this result indicates an increasing boundary layer effect and a greater involvement of the film diffusion at higher dye concentrations for this particular time range 64 3 4 adsorption isotherms to depict the adsorption process thoroughly the experimental data were analyzed by langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm models 65 the adsorption isotherms of gv on cofe2o4 ac at 298 303 308 313 k and ac at 303 k are shown in fig 9 each characteristic parameter of isotherms was determined the langmuir isotherm model hypothesis is proposed by monolayer adsorption on the surface of the adsorbent which can be expressed in eq 8 8 c e q e 1 k l q max c e q max where q max is the maximum dye adsorption onto adsorbent mg g 1 and k l is the langmuir adsorption equilibrium constant l g 1 related to the free energy of adsorption for the langmuir type adsorption process the influence of the isotherm shape on whether adsorption is favorable or unfavorable can be classified by the separation factor r l which is considered as a more reliable indicator of the adsorption capacity this constant is evaluated as 9 r l 1 1 k l c i where ci mg l 1 is the initial dye concentration of the adsorbate and k l l mg 1 is the langmuir constant there are four possibilities of r l value favorable 0 r l 1 unfavorable r l 1 linear r l 1 or irreversible r l 0 the freundlich model is based on the assumption that multilayer adsorption occurs on the surface of adsorbents with unequally available sites of different adsorption energies the well known logarithmic form of freundlich model is represented by eq 10 10 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where k f mg 1 n l n g 1 is freundlich constants in relevant to bonding energy and 1 n is the heterogeneity factor used to characterize the heterogeneity of the system respectively the d r isotherm can be used to describe adsorption on both homogenous and heterogeneous surfaces the d r isotherm model can be expressed as eq 11 11 ln q e ln q m β ε 2 where q m mg g 1 is the theoretical maximum adsorption capacity onto adsorbent and ε is polanyi potential which is described as eq 12 12 ε rt ln 1 1 c e where t is the temperature k and r is the gas constant the value of mean sorption energy e a kj mol 1 can be calculated from d r parameter β using the relationship 13 e a 2 β 1 2 when the e a is lower than 8 0 kj mol 1 the adsorption process proceeds through a physical mechanism while it lies between 8 and 16 kj mol 1 the adsorption process is ascribed to chemical adsorption mechanism the isotherm constants and correlation coefficients for gv adsorption on cofe2o4 ac and ac were calculated and shown in tables 5 and 6 obviously both adsorbents follow monolayer surface coverage model of langmuir since all the correlation coefficients r 2 of langmuir isotherm are larger than those of freundlich and d r models the r l in all the cases lies between 0 and 1 indicating that the adsorption processes of gv on cofe2o4 ac and ac are favorable under conditions used in this study the maximum adsorption capacity of cofe2o4 ac was found to be 184 2 mg g 1 at 303 k which is slightly higher than that of ac 180 3 mg g 1 this result suggests that for cofe2o4 ac composite ac plays a major role in adsorption table 7 lists the comparison of the maximum adsorption capacity for gv adsorption on various types of adsorbents it can be seen that cofe2o4 ac composite used in this work has a relatively higher adsorption though the adsorption capacity is not the highest 66 75 in addition the estimated values of e a for cofe2o4 ac and ac were found to be less than 8 kj mol 1 which indicates that physisorption might dominate the adsorption of gv onto cofe2o4 ac and ac 76 77 the thermodynamic parameters can provide in depth information regarding the inherent energetic changes associated with the adsorption the thermodynamics parameters including enthalpy change δh o gibbs free energy change δg o and entropy change δs o were calculated using the following formulas 78 14 δ g rt ln k c 15 k c a s a e v s v e q e c e 16 ln k c δ h rt δ s r where a s is the activity of adsorbed dye a e is the activity of dye in solution at equilibrium v s is the activity coefficient of the adsorbed dye and v e is the activity coefficient of dye in solution as dye concentration in the solution decreases and approaches zero k c can be obtained by plotting ln q e c e vs q e and extrapolating q e to zero 79 as shown in fig 10 a the plot of ln k c versus t 1 is shown in fig 10b the regression equation is ln kc 2 959 103 t 1 15 38 n 4 r2 0 9868 the values of δso and δho were calculated from the intercept and slope of lnkc versus t 1 mentioned above the δg δh and δs values are listed in table 8 the δg o is negative and δh o is positive indicating that the adsorption process is spontaneous and endothermic the positive value of δso reflects an increase in randomness at the solid solution interface during the adsorption of gv onto cofe2o4 ac composite 80 81 generally δh o for physisorption is in the range from 20 to 40 kj mol 1 while chemisorption is between 400 and 80 kj mol 1 82 83 the calculated δh o 24 60 kj mol 1 confirms that the adsorption of gv onto cofe2o4 ac composite is a physisorption process 3 5 desorption studies reusability of an adsorbent is of crucial importance in industrial practice for dye removal from wastewaters 84 as shown in fig 11 the reusability cycles were carried out up to five times and the adsorption capacities of the regenerated cofe2o4 ac for gv were calculated it can be seen that the regenerated cofe2o4 ac still have remarkable adsorption capacities for the removal of gv from gv solution within five cycles these results indicate that cofe2o4 ac could be potentially used as a magnetic adsorbent to remove dye contaminants from water for avoiding the secondary pollution 3 6 real wastewater applications in order to evaluate whether the synthesized adsorbent cofe2o4 ac could be applied in practical applications we had collected sewage water from two local sewage treatment plants including dengjiachun sewage treatment plant and xi an capital water company limited and xi an city moat in china added 0 200 0 500 or 1 00 ml gv solution 5 00 103 mg l 1 to 10 ml of each wastewater sample respectively and then diluted the obtained solution to 100 ml with the same wastewater then 10 mg of cofe2o4 ac were applied to remove the gv all of the sample measurements were performed in triplicate the detail data are listed in table 9 as can be seen the removal efficiency is in the range of 90 97 4 conclusions in this work cofe2o4 ac composite was synthesized and used as an adsorbent for the removal of gv from aqueous solution the adsorption capacity of gv was dependent on initial dye concentration contact time adsorbent dosage and solution ph the equilibrium adsorption data fitted well to the langmuir model and the maximum adsorption capability of gv on cofe2o4 ac was 184 2 mg g 1 at 303 k the remarkable adsorption capacity of gv onto cofe2o4 ac was attributed to strong π π interaction and weak electrostatic attraction between gv and cofe2o4 ac the adsorption process could be described by the pseudo second order kinetic model the whole adsorption process was jointly controlled by external mass transfer and intraparticle diffusion the negative δg o and positive δh indicated that adsorption of gv by cofe2o4 ac was spontaneous and endothermic in nature the as prepared cofe2o4 ac with low cost and high adsorption capacity may be an effective adsorbent material for the removal of gv from wastewater conflict of interest the authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest to this work acknowledgements this work was

be regenerated using acidic ethanol solution and was separable from liquid media using a magnetic field keywords cofe2o4 activated carbon composite gentian violet magnetic composite adsorption 1 introduction gentian violet also known as crystal violet cv is a triphenylmethane dye used extensively in textile paper and printing ink industries and also used as a biological stain bacteriostatic agent in veterinary medicine and skin disinfectant in humans 1 2 consequently high concentration of gv is always present in industrial wastewaters 3 however gv is harmful by inhalation ingestion as well as through skin adsorption 4 it may cause cancer and severe eye irritation in human beings 5 the presence of gv in the aqueous water system is considered to pose a risk to human health it is necessary to treat gv contaminated wastewater prior to its discharge to the environment 6 the major techniques applied for water purification include adsorption ion exchange flocculation photo dissociation ultrafiltration and membrane process 7 12 adsorption is one of the most effective and economic techniques this technique can handle fairly large flow rates producing a high quality effluent that does not result in the formation of harmful substances such as ozone and free radicals 13 14 different adsorbents have been utilized to remove the wastewaters containing gv aboelfetoh et al reports a facile method for the synthesis of reduced graphene oxide rgo cuχo nanohybrids by the hydrothermal method under diverse cu ii loading and alkali concentrations in the absence of an extra reducing agent the nanohybrids were utilized as adsorbents for the removal of methyl blue mb and crystal violet cv as models of anionic and cationic dyes 15 martins et al oxidized cellulose cel and sugarcane bagasse sb with an h3po4 nano2 mixture to obtain adsorbent materials with high contents of carboxylic groups the optimized synthesis conditions yielded cox and sbox with 4 8 mmol g and 4 5 mmol g of carboxylic acid groups respectively the materials produced oxidized cellulose cox and oxidized sugarcane bagasse sbox were used for the removal of the model cationic dyes cv and auramine o

polyacrylamide microspheres for efficient removal of cationic dyes by a simple polymerization induced phase separation method which showed perfect magnetic separation performance and a high adsorption capacity for mb neutral red nr and gv from aqueous solution 18 bellir et al prepared an activated bentonite by mixing bentonite with concentrated sulfiric acid at 60 c for 2 h and investigated its adsorption property toward gv from an aqueous solution 19 among these adsorbents low adsorption capacities harsh preparation conditions or expensive cost may limit their application in large scale cofe2o4 is a promising material owing to its magnetic properties such as strong anisotropy high coercivity at room temperature moderate saturation magnetization and good mechanical and chemical stabilities 20 21 it is extensively used in a variety of applications including high density information storage 22 lithium ion batteries 23 and magnetic drug delivery 24 recently cofe2o4 based composite adsorbent has attracted people s attention due to economic consideration and favorable dynamic property and has been used for wastewater treatment for example zhou et al developed a facile one pot synthetic route to decorate carbon nanotubes with nh2 functionalized superparamagnetic cofe2o4 nanoparticles for improved surface functionalization 25 the resulting magnetic composites exhibited better adsorption properties for tetrabromobisphenol a and pb ii rouby s group produced cnts decorated with cofe2o4 nanoparticles for the removal of methyl green dye from aqueous solutions 26 li et al synthesized magnetic cofe2o4 functionalized graphene sheets cofe2o4 fgs nanocomposites by hydrothermal treatment of inorganic salts and thermal exfoliated graphene sheets which had great potential as an effective absorbent for removing methyl orange in water 27 ai et al synthesized montmorillonite cofe2o4 and cofe2o4 activated carbon cofe2o4 ac composites by a simple one step refluxing route and their adsorption properties were investigated as magnetic adsorbents for the removal of mb and malachite green dye from wastewaters 28 29 among the cofe2o4 based composite adsorbents mentioned above cofe2o4 ac composite has remarkable affinity toward organic and inorganic contaminants in water 30 however to best of our knowledge few works using cofe2o4 ac composite as an adsorbent were reported 29 30 here we introduced cofe2o4 particles into the pores of activated carbon ac by a facile one step low temperature refluxing route the obtained cofe2o4 ac composite was characterized by x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy brunauer emmett teller bet surface area method and vibrating sample magnetometer vsm techniques respectively the composite was used to remove gv in water solution the adsorption process was investigated as the function of ionic strength temperature solution ph adsorbent dosage contact time and initial gv

powder sodium hydroxide naoh and ferric nitrate fe no3 3 9h2o were purchased from tianjin tianli chemical reagent comp ltd china cobalt ii nitrate co no3 2 6h2o and gentian violet gv were obtained from tianjin kermel chemical reagent co ltd china a stock solution of gv 5 00 10 3 mg l 1 was prepared by dissolving 0 500 g of gv in 100 ml water all the gv solutions used in the adsorption experiments were prepared by diluting the stock solution to the required concentrations with water twice distilled water was used throughout the experiments all the chemical reagents were of analytical grade without further purification 2 2 preparation of cofe2o4 accomposite approximately 25 g ac was soaked in 5 mol l 1 hcl for 24 h and then thoroughly washed with water until constant ph of the washed liquid was achieved the treated ac was dried in oven at 110 c for 4 h and then stored in a cacl2 desiccator until used in the experiments 31 cofe2o4 ac composite was prepared by a facile one step low temperature refluxing route 29 a proportion of the treated ac was added into a 150 ml alkaline solution containing 3 4 g naoh and stirred at room temperature for 30 min to get ac suspension the suspension was maintained at 373 k to keep it at slightly boiling state and then 50 ml metal nitrate solution containing 5 4944 g fe no3 3 9h2o 1 360 10 2 mol and 1 9790 g co no3 2 6h2o 6 799 10 3 mol was poured as quickly as possible into the above boiling suspension under stirring the amount of ac was adjusted in order to obtain cofe2o4 ac composite with weight ratio of 1 3 the mixture solution was refluxed at 373 k for 2 h after the reaction was complete the resulting cofe2o4 ac composites were collected by an external magnet washed with water several times and dried at 353 k under vacuum for 12 h 32 2 3 characterization methods the crystalline structures analysis of the composite was carried out within 2θ range of 10 80 on an xrd diffractometer xrd 7000 x ray diffractometer shimadzu operating at 40 kv and 30 ma with cu ka radiation k 0 154056 nm the crystallite domain size was calculated from the width of the xrd peak using scherrer s eq 1 1 d k λ β cos θ where d is the average crystallite domain size perpendicular to the composites λ is the x ray wavelength β is the full width at half maximum fwhm and θ is the diffraction angle ft ir spectra of ac cofe2o4 gv cofe2o4 ac and cofe2o4 ac gv cofe2o4 ac composite after adsorption of gv in aqueous solution in the range 4000 400 cm 1 were recorded by fourier infrared spectrometer ft ir equinx55 brucher using kbr pellet technique the ph at which the adsorbent surface charge takes a zero value is defined as point of zero charge phpzc at this ph the charge of the positive surface sites is equal to that of the negative ones the phpzc of cofe2o4 ac composite was determined by a mass titration method 33 various amounts of cofe2o4 ac composite samples were put into 10 ml of 0 10 mol l 1 kno3 solutions prepared with boiled water the bottles were sealed and shaken overnight the equilibrium ph values of the mixtures were measured and the limiting ph was taken as the phpzc the ph values were determined by a ph meter phs 25 rex electric chemical china the magnetic properties of cofe2o4 and cofe2o4 ac were measured by vibrating sample magnetometer at room temperature vsm lake shore 6653 usa the bet n2 method was used to determine the specific surface areas and pore structure of ac cofe2o4 and cofe2o4 ac using a micromeritics asap 2020 analyzer micromeritics instrument co usa 2 4 batch adsorption experiments adsorption studies were carried out in a batch model using a thermostated shaker changzhou guohua electric appliance comp ltd china the gv solutions with initial concentrations from 50 to 350 mg l 1 were used for batch adsorption experiments for each run a certain amount of cofe2o4 ac composite and 100 ml of gv solution were transferred in a flask and agitated in a temperature controlled shaker with a constant speed of 200 rpm at different ph and contact time at predetermined time intervals 5 ml of dispersion was drawn and separated immediately by an adscititious magnet to collect adsorbent the supernate containing residual gv was determined at 584 nm using tu 1901 double beam uv vis spectrophotometer beijing general instrument co ltd china 18 the dyes concentration was calculated from a calibration curve of absorbance versus dye concentration all determinations were performed in triplicate per experiment because asorption depends on various factors like the contact time ph ionic strength and temperature the influences of such factors were studied the ph of the gv solution was adjusted by adding negligible volumes of 0 1 mol l 1 hcl or naoh solution to explore the impact of ionic strength on gv removal gv solutions containing different concentrations of kno3 were used the amount of adsorbed gv qt mg g 1 on adsorbents at a given time t min and removal efficiency r were calculated as eqs 2 and 3 2 q t c 0 c t v m 3 r c 0 c e c 0 100 where c 0 ct and c e mg l 1 are gv concentrations at the begeinning at a given time t and at equilibrium respectively v l is the initial solution volume and m g is the adsorbent weight 2 5 desorption experiments desorption studies were also conducted in the batch mode similar to adsorption studies 0 10 g cofe2o4 ac adsorbents were added to 100 ml of dye solutions 100 mg l 1 with contact time of 190 min at 303 k the dye loaded cofe2o4 ac adsorbents were separated from their aqueous solutions by an adscititious magnet and washed with distilled water in order to remove the unadsorbed traces of gv regeneration of exhausted cofe2o4 ac saturated with gv was conducted by using the solvent desorption technique these dye loaded cofe2o4 ac adsorbents were brought into contact with 20 ml of a mixture of hcl 0 01 mol l 1 solution and anhydrous ethanol 5 5 v v and the suspensions were shaken for 20 min at 298 k with a shaking speed of 200 rpm after desorption the adsorbent was magnetically separated washed with water and dried in an oven at 378 k for the next cycle to test the reusability of the adsorbent described adsorption desorption cycle was repeated several times with the same adsorbent the amount of adsorbed gv q e mg g 1 on adsorbents at equilibrium was calculated as eq 4 4 q e c 0 c e v m 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the adsorbent fig 1 shows the xrd patterns of cofe2o4 cofe2o4 ac and ac all peaks were normalized according to the maximum peak the diffraction peaks in fig 1 a can be perfectly indexed to the cubic spinel structure jcpds card no 22 1086 and no characteristic peaks of impurities are detected in the xrd pattern implying the formation of the single phase spinel 27 the observed diffraction peaks are broad and less sharp indicating as prepared cofe2o4 particles with small dimensions as shown in fig 1 b the xrd pattern of cofe2o4 ac is almost identical to that of the cofe2o4 particles while the peak intensity of cofe2o4 decreases in the presence of ac which is due to part of cofe2o4 particles being incorporated inside the pores of ac 34 the average crystallite sizes of bare cofe2o4 particles and cofe2o4 particles in cofe2o4 ac composite were calculated using the scherrer formula to be 21 81 and 27 22 nm respectively it is obvious that the average crystallite size of cofe2o4 particles in cofe2o4 ac composite is slightly bigger than that of bare cofe2o4 particles this result implies that the crystallite structure of cofe2o4 particles may not change in the presence of ac the ft ir spectra of cofe2o4 cofe2o4 ac cofe2o4 ac gv cofe2o4 ac composite after adsorption of gv in aqueous solution ac and gv are depicted in fig 2 as for the spectrum of cofe2o4 the stronger absorption peak at 596 cm 1 is characteristic of fe o bond stretching vibration fig 2 a 35 the adsorption peak at 596 cm 1 also appears in the ft ir spectrum of cofe2o4 ac composite fig 2 b which demonstrates that the presence of ac almost has no effect on the crystallite structure of cofe2o4 a weak adsorption peak at 1090 cm 1 shown in the ft ir spectrum of ac fig 2 d belongs to the symmetric stretching vibration of coc group the weak adsorption peak of coc group decreases obviously in the ft ir spectrum of cofe2o4 ac fig 2 b which may be explained by the forming of coo or feo coordination bonds between oxygen atoms of coc groups and cofe2o4 36 two peaks observed at 1170 and 1587 cm 1 are characteristic of the c n and cc stretching vibration of aromatic ring fig 2 e these bands also appear in the ft ir spectrum of cofe2o4 ac gv fig 2 c which suggests that gv has been adsorbed onto cofe2o4 ac composite the magnetization measurements of cofe2o4 and cofe2o4 ac were carried out using a vibrating sample magnetometer vsm at room temperature with an applied magnetic field of 8 koe as can be seen in fig 3 both samples show ferromagnetic behavior the saturation magnetization ms remnant magnetization mr and coercivity hc values of cofe2o4 and cofe2o4 ac are 47 4 emu g 1 2 9 emu g 1 and 25 5 oe and 15 6 emu g 1 0 4 emu g 1 and 45 5 oe respectively table 1 in contrast the ms and mr values of cofe2o4 ac are smaller than those of cofe2o4 which may be attributed to the presence of non magnetic ac in the magnetic composite 37 nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms and the pore size distributions of cofe2o4 cofe2o4 ac and ac are shown in fig 4 a1 a3 and 4b all the samples exhibit type iv isotherms definition by iupac which is acharacteristic of mesoporous materials isotherms of cofe2o4 fig 4a1 also exhibits an h2 type hysteresis at the relative pressure p p 0 between 0 4 and 0 9 which is indicative of ink bottle shaped pores 38 the isotherm of the cofe2o4 ac composite is quite close to that of ac fig 4a2 and 4a3 both isotherms exhibit an h3 type hysteresis at high relative pressure which is typical of activated carbon due to the presence of slit shaped pores 39 the data of the bet surface area pore volume and average pore diameter of bare cofe2o4 cofe2o4 ac and ac are listed in table 2 average pore diameter distribution curves were estimated from the adsorption isotherms using bareett joyner halenda bjh the specific surface area and pore volume of cofe2o4 calculated using the bet equation are 109 9 m2 g 1 and 0 189 cm3 g 1 respectively as compared with ac and cofe2o4 ac bare cofe2o4 possesses the lowest surface area and pore volume the average pore diameters for cofe2o4 cofe2o4 ac and ac are 7 784 3 858 and 3 896 nm respectively the average diameters of all the samples are in the range 2 10 nm which belongs to mesopores the bet surface areas for cofe2o4 cofe2o4 ac and ac are 109 9 268 7 and 287 4 m2 g 1 respectively compared with bare cofe2o4 and ac the average pore diameter bet surface area and average pore diameter of cofe2o4 ac composite are quite close to those of ac these results indicate that the mesoporous structure of ac may not change in the presence of cofe2o4 and imply that the surface of cofe2o4 ac composite mainly consists of ac through co o or fe o coordination bonds cofe2o4 particles are attached to the pores of ac 3 2 effect of experimental conditions 3 2 1 effect of ionic strength electrostatic interactions are divided into two types electrostatic attraction and electrostatic repulsion theoretically when the electrostatic interaction between the adsorbent surface and adsorbate ions is attractive an increase in ionic strength will decrease the adsorption capacity conversely when the electrostatic interaction is repulsive an increase in ionic strength will increase adsorption 16 in order to test the effect of ionic strength on the adsorption of gv 100 mg l 1 gv solutions ph 10 2 containing different concentrations of kno3 were used for adsorption experiment as shown in fig 5 a the removal efficiency of gv doesn t change significantly with increasing concentration of kno3 in the range 0 1 0 mol l 1 indicating that ionic strength almost has no significant effect on the adsorption of gv onto cofe2o4 ac composite this result demonstrates that the adsorption of gv onto cofe2o4 ac composite isn t be controlled by the electrostatic interaction hydrogen bonds or π π interaction may play a main role in gv adsorption 40 3 2 2 effect of adsorption temperature the temperature has great negative effect on the adsorption quantity if hydrogen bonds are the main adsorption mechanism in the adsorption process the effect of temperature on the removal efficiency of gv was investigated in the temperature from 293 k to 318 k and the results are shown in fig 5b the removal efficiency of gv increases rapidly with increasing temperature from 293 k to 303 k when the temperature is higher than 303 k the removal efficiency of gv rises slowly this result indicates that hydrogen bonds may not be the main interaction of gv absorbed on cofe2o4 ac composite 41 the π π interaction may play a main role in gv adsorption 42 3 2 3 effect of ph on dye adsorption the solution ph is an important factor for adsorption process it affects both aqueous chemistry and surface binding sites of the adsorbent 43 and is related with structural changes of dye molecule 44 the effect of solution ph on the adsorption of dye was investigated in ph range from 4 5 to 11 5 as shown in fig 6 a the removal efficiency of gv increases from 82 to 95 with the increase of ph from 4 5 to 10 2 and the highest removal efficiency of gv was obtained at ph 10 2 in aqueous solution gv is present in two forms cationic form gv and gv leucocarbinol both forms are converted into each other the equilibrium being ph dependent scheme 1 45 46 the phpzc of cofe2o4 ac determined by using mass titration method is 9 7 fig 6b at ph values lower than 9 7 gv predominantly presents as cationic form gv and the surface of cofe2o4 ac composite is also positively charged the adsorption of gv on cofe2o4 ac is mainly attributed to strong π π interaction between bulk π systems on cofe2o4 ac surfaces and cc group or benzene rings of gv 47 48 in the ph range 9 7 10 2 gv still predominantly presents as cationic form gv while the surface of cofe2o4 ac composite is negatively charged higher removal efficiency of gv observed in the ph range 9 7 10 2 is due to strong π π interaction and weak electrostatic attraction between cofe2o4 ac and gv as solution ph is changed from 10 2 to 11 5 the removal efficiency decreases from 95 to 92 the slight decrease of removal efficiency may be because part of gv is converted into its non ionized form gv leucocarbinol 49 50 gv is a propeller shaped molecule with a quasi planar structure while gv leucocarbinol is a non planar molecule 51 as compared with gv gv leucocarbinol isn t readily absorbed on ac 52 53 this phenomenon can be explained by relatively weaker π π plane to plane interaction between non planar aromatic adsorbates and bulk π systems of ac 54 55 in addition the hydrogen bonding interaction between oh group of gv leucocarbinol and water might also decrease the adsorption of gv leucocarbinol onto cofe2o4 ac 56 3 2 4 effect of amount of adsorbent the effect of adsorbent dosage on gv removal was examined in the range 0 2 1 4 g l 1 fig 7 the results show that the removal efficiency of dye sharply increases with increasing amount of the adsorbents in the range 0 2 1 0 g l 1 the increase in the removal efficiency is due to the increase in active sites on the adsorbent and thus making easier penetration of gv dye to the adsorption sites 57 when the adsorbent exceeds 1 0 g l 1 the removal efficiency almost reaches a constant value thus an optimal adsorbent dosage for gv adsorption was found to be 1 0 g l 1 3 2 5 effects of contact time and initial concentration effects of contact time and gv initial concentration on the absorption of gv were studied and the results are showed in fig 8 a the adsorption capacities of cofe2o4 ac increase rapidly in the initial stages of contact time and then slow down gradually until they attain equilibrium for the concentration of 100 mg l 1 gv the adsorption capacity of cofe2o4 ac increases rapidly in the initial stage of 40 min and reaches equilibrium at 180 min the fast removal rate during the initial stage may be attributed to the rapid diffusion of gv from the bulk solution to the external surfaces of cofe2o4 ac as the sites being gradually occupied the adsorbed gv tends to be transported from the bulk phase to the actual sorption sites i e inner sphere pores of cofe2o4 ac such slow diffusion process will decrease the sorption rate of gv at later stages 58 effect of initial gv concentration on the adsorption by cofe2o4 ac was explored at three different initial concentrations of gv 100 200 and 300 mg l 1 as shown in fig 8a the adsorption capacities of gv by cofe2o4 ac at a given time and at equilibrium all increase with increasing the initial dye concentration the increase of the adsorption capacities of gv with increasing the initial gv concentration could be attributed to an increase in the driving force of concentration gradient with an increase in the initial gv concentration 59 thus it is clear that the adsorption process is highly dependent on initial gv concentration and contact time the contact time of 190 min and initial gv concentration of 100 mg l 1 were selected in the subsequent experiments 3 3 adsorption kinetics to investigate the adsorption mechanism of gv onto cofe2o4 ac composite two kinetic models pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were tested to find the best fitted model for the experimental data the pseudo first order kinetic model can be defined as eq 5 5 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t where k 1 min 1 is the rate constant of pseudo first order kinetic adsorption the values of k 1 and q e can be determined from the slope and intercept of the plot respectively the pseudo second order kinetic model can be presented in eq 6 6 t q t 1 q e 2 k 2 t q e where k 2 g mg 1 min 1 is the rate constant of the pseudo second order kinetic adsorption the kinetic parameters in both models were determined from linear plots of log q e qt versus t for the pseudo first order kinetic model fig 8b and t qt versus t for the pseudo second order kinetic model fig 8c the adsorption rate constants calculated for both kinetic models are summarized in table 3 the correlation coefficients r 2 for the pseudo first order kinetic model are relatively low and the calculated q e values q e cal from the pseudo first order kinetic model do not agree with the experimental data q e exp indicating that the adsorption process does not follow the pseudo first order kinetic adsorption expression for the pseudo second order kinetic model the r 2 values are higher than 0 999 and the q e cal values agree well with the q e exp values which indicates that the pseudo second order kinetic model is feasible to describe the adsorption process of gv on cofe2o4 ac to test the diffusion mechanism between gv molecule and cofe2o4 ac an intra particle diffusion model proposed by weber and morris was used the linearized intraparticle diffusion model is given as eq 7 60 7 q t k i t 0 5 c where k i mg g 1 min 0 5 is the intra particle diffusion rate constant and c value mg g 1 represents a constant depicting resistance to mass transfer in the boundary layer the k i and c were calculated from the slope and intercept of lines obtained from plots of qt versus t 0 5 generally the adsorption in this model involves following steps 1 bulk diffusion 2 film diffusion 3 intraparticle diffusion and 4 chemical reaction via ion exchange or the adsorption of adsorbate at an active site on the surface of adsorbent 61 if the regression of qt versus t 0 5 is linear and passes through the origin intraparticle diffusion is the sole rate limiting step 62 plots of qt against t 0 5 with different gv concentrations are shown in fig 8d the values of k i and c are listed in table 4 it is found that all the plots have two linear portions this feature indicates that more than one mode of adsorption is involved the first linear portion includes the adsorption period of 0 64 min which represents external mass transfer the second linear portion includes the adsorption period of 64 180 min representing intraparticle diffusion the second linear portions do not cross the origin c 0 suggesting that intraparticle diffusion is not the only rate controlling step and the external mass transfer is also occurring simultaneously the overall adsorption process may be jointly controlled by external mass transfer and intraparticle diffusion 63 as shown in table 4 the intra particle diffusion rate constant k i2 increases from 0 316 mg g 1 min 0 5 to 2 319 mg g 1 min 0 5 with the increasing initial dye concentration from 100 mg l 1 to 300 mg l 1 this observation shows faster intra particle diffusion at higher initial concentrations for the same linear section the value of c increases from 88 6 mg g 1 to 161 9 mg g 1 when the initial gv concentration increases this result indicates an increasing boundary layer effect and a greater involvement of the film diffusion at higher dye concentrations for this particular time range 64 3 4 adsorption isotherms to depict the adsorption process thoroughly the experimental data were analyzed by langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm models 65 the adsorption isotherms of gv on cofe2o4 ac at 298 303 308 313 k and ac at 303 k are shown in fig 9 each characteristic parameter of isotherms was determined the langmuir isotherm model hypothesis is proposed by monolayer adsorption on the surface of the adsorbent which can be expressed in eq 8 8 c e q e 1 k l q max c e q max where q max is the maximum dye adsorption onto adsorbent mg g 1 and k l is the langmuir adsorption equilibrium constant l g 1 related to the free energy of adsorption for the langmuir type adsorption process the influence of the isotherm shape on whether adsorption is favorable or unfavorable can be classified by the separation factor r l which is considered as a more reliable indicator of the adsorption capacity this constant is evaluated as 9 r l 1 1 k l c i where ci mg l 1 is the initial dye concentration of the adsorbate and k l l mg 1 is the langmuir constant there are four possibilities of r l value favorable 0 r l 1 unfavorable r l 1 linear r l 1 or irreversible r l 0 the freundlich model is based on the assumption that multilayer adsorption occurs on the surface of adsorbents with unequally available sites of different adsorption energies the well known logarithmic form of freundlich model is represented by eq 10 10 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where k f mg 1 n l n g 1 is freundlich constants in relevant to bonding energy and 1 n is the heterogeneity factor used to characterize the heterogeneity of the system respectively the d r isotherm can be used to describe adsorption on both homogenous and heterogeneous surfaces the d r isotherm model can be expressed as eq 11 11 ln q e ln q m β ε 2 where q m mg g 1 is the theoretical maximum adsorption capacity onto adsorbent and ε is polanyi potential which is described as eq 12 12 ε rt ln 1 1 c e where t is the temperature k and r is the gas constant the value of mean sorption energy e a kj mol 1 can be calculated from d r parameter β using the relationship 13 e a 2 β 1 2 when the e a is lower than 8 0 kj mol 1 the adsorption process proceeds through a physical mechanism while it lies between 8 and 16 kj mol 1 the adsorption process is ascribed to chemical adsorption mechanism the isotherm constants and correlation coefficients for gv adsorption on cofe2o4 ac and ac were calculated and shown in tables 5 and 6 obviously both adsorbents follow monolayer surface coverage model of langmuir since all the correlation coefficients r 2 of langmuir isotherm are larger than those of freundlich and d r models the r l in all the cases lies between 0 and 1 indicating that the adsorption processes of gv on cofe2o4 ac and ac are favorable under conditions used in this study the maximum adsorption capacity of cofe2o4 ac was found to be 184 2 mg g 1 at 303 k which is slightly higher than that of ac 180 3 mg g 1 this result suggests that for cofe2o4 ac composite ac plays a major role in adsorption table 7 lists the comparison of the maximum adsorption capacity for gv adsorption on various types of adsorbents it can be seen that cofe2o4 ac composite used in this work has a relatively higher adsorption though the adsorption capacity is not the highest 66 75 in addition the estimated values of e a for cofe2o4 ac and ac were found to be less than 8 kj mol 1 which indicates that physisorption might dominate the adsorption of gv onto cofe2o4 ac and ac 76 77 the thermodynamic parameters can provide in depth information regarding the inherent energetic changes associated with the adsorption the thermodynamics parameters including enthalpy change δh o gibbs free energy change δg o and entropy change δs o were calculated using the following formulas 78 14 δ g rt ln k c 15 k c a s a e v s v e q e c e 16 ln k c δ h rt δ s r where a s is the activity of adsorbed dye a e is the activity of dye in solution at equilibrium v s is the activity coefficient of the adsorbed dye and v e is the activity coefficient of dye in solution as dye concentration in the solution decreases and approaches zero k c can be obtained by plotting ln q e c e vs q e and extrapolating q e to zero 79 as shown in fig 10 a the plot of ln k c versus t 1 is shown in fig 10b the regression equation is ln kc 2 959 103 t 1 15 38 n 4 r2 0 9868 the values of δso and δho were calculated from the intercept and slope of lnkc versus t 1 mentioned above the δg δh and δs values are listed in table 8 the δg o is negative and δh o is positive indicating that the adsorption process is spontaneous and endothermic the positive value of δso reflects an increase in randomness at the solid solution interface during the adsorption of gv onto cofe2o4 ac composite 80 81 generally δh o for physisorption is in the range from 20 to 40 kj mol 1 while chemisorption is between 400 and 80 kj mol 1 82 83 the calculated δh o 24 60 kj mol 1 confirms that the adsorption of gv onto cofe2o4 ac composite is a physisorption process 3 5 desorption studies reusability of an adsorbent is of crucial importance in industrial practice for dye removal from wastewaters 84 as shown in fig 11 the reusability cycles were carried out up to five times and the adsorption capacities of the regenerated cofe2o4 ac for gv were calculated it can be seen that the regenerated cofe2o4 ac still have remarkable adsorption capacities for the removal of gv from gv solution within five cycles these results indicate that cofe2o4 ac could be potentially used as a magnetic adsorbent to remove dye contaminants from water for avoiding the secondary pollution 3 6 real wastewater applications in order to evaluate whether the synthesized adsorbent cofe2o4 ac could be applied in practical applications we had collected sewage water from two local sewage treatment plants including dengjiachun sewage treatment plant and xi an capital water company limited and xi an city moat in china added 0 200 0 500 or 1 00 ml gv solution 5 00 103 mg l 1 to 10 ml of each wastewater sample respectively and then diluted the obtained solution to 100 ml with the same wastewater then 10 mg of cofe2o4 ac were applied to remove the gv all of the sample measurements were performed in triplicate the detail data are listed in table 9 as can be seen the removal efficiency is in the range of 90 97 4 conclusions in this work cofe2o4 ac composite was synthesized and used as an adsorbent for the removal of gv from aqueous solution the adsorption capacity of gv was dependent on initial dye concentration contact time adsorbent dosage and solution ph the equilibrium adsorption data fitted well to the langmuir model and the maximum adsorption capability of gv on cofe2o4 ac was 184 2 mg g 1 at 303 k the remarkable adsorption capacity of gv onto cofe2o4 ac was attributed to strong π π interaction and weak electrostatic attraction between gv and cofe2o4 ac the adsorption process could be described by the pseudo second order kinetic model the whole adsorption process was jointly controlled by external mass transfer and intraparticle diffusion the negative δg o and positive δh indicated that adsorption of gv by cofe2o4 ac was spontaneous and endothermic in nature the as prepared cofe2o4 ac with low cost and high adsorption capacity may be an effective adsorbent material for the removal of gv from wastewater conflict of interest the authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest to this work acknowledgements this work was

14463,the scarcity of water is an increasingly alarming issue all over the world and each sector of society must take action to reduce water use in its activities in chemical and petrochemical industries water is a fundamental resource for the production process this industrial sector has a demand for great quantities of water with specified qualities for each process as the water runs through the industrial processes it incorporates several substances and its characteristics modify it becomes an effluent that must be treated so as to accommodate the emission standards established in the regulations in most cases the standards for disposal are less restrictive than the quality standards for industrial reuse of this effluent if it is not considered for reuse all related activities will be compromised this work presents a case study of a brazilian petrochemical industry where various aqueous streams were characterized to evaluate the quality requirements necessary for water reuse in the production process the work examines water use and the quality of each aqueous stream characterizing them with respect to alkalinity chlorides electrical conductivity chemical oxygen demand total hardness iron ph silica total solids sulfates and turbidity the study demonstrates that the cooling water stream has elevated concentrations for these parameters and thus demands less quality for water reuse in general demineralized water presents the lowest concentrations for the parameters under evaluation and therefore requires greater quality for water reuse keywords water characterization petrochemical industry water reuse 1 introduction the scarcity of water is an increasingly alarming issue throughout the world according to information disclosed by the state of são paulo environmental company cetesb 1 1 2 billion people in the world do not have access to treated water and 1 8 billion people do not have adequate basic sanitation services faced with this shortage problem there is a need to develop strategies to improve water use management in its different applications 2 in the chemical and petrochemical industries water is a fundamental resource to the production process for example in petroleum production and processing units nearly 6 cubic meters of water are used for each cubic meter of processed petroleum 3 for the petrochemical industry evaluated in this work prior studies showed a water consumption of 4 5 m³ t which corresponds to 2333 m³ h of water for application 2 4 in order to reduce water consumption indicators different industrial sectors have been applying water reuse such as refining and petrochemical 5 7 leather industry 8 9 food industry 10 11 among others as the way goes through the industrial processes it incorporates several substances and its characteristics change it becomes an effluent that must be treated in order to fulfill the emission standards in regulations in most cases the standards are less restrictive than the quality requirements for industry applications if these are not taken into consideration for implementing reuse all related activities will be compromised 12 13 the quality of reused water must be sufficiently elevated to prevent problems in production processes such as corrosion in pipes and equipment influenced by various parameters such as dissolved oxygen ph alkalinity the presence of sulfates and chlorides temperature the presence of carbon gas concentration of organic material and other factors mud deposits in heat exchangers iron particle deposits in ion exchange resins among others 14 15 the most relevant physical and chemical parameters to evaluate industrial water reuse are presented in table 1 this work aims to conduct a study on water use and quality in a petrochemical industry by discussing the most relevant quality parameters in the production process this study is fundamentally important since industrial water reuse must attend to the

allowed for each parameter evaluated so that there are no negative effects during water use in the production process such as corrosion or encrustation in pipes and processing equipment the limiting concentrations were determined through a survey of previously established criteria for each type of water used in the industry for comparison we searched for reference concentrations in the technical literature indicated for industrial cooling water and demineralized water for supplying high pressure boilers by the authors mancuso and santos 31 and mierzwa and hespanhol 14 to ascertain whether the criteria adopted by the company are in the same order of magnitude as the values indicated by the authors 2 3 characterization of the aqueous streams once the water consumers in the industrial process were identified the existing physical and chemical analyses which are conducted periodically for the operational control of different aqueous streams were compiled the analyses contemplated cooling towers 1 2 3 and 4 raw water collected from the river demineralized water clarified water ash handling water bearing water drinking water and treated effluents table 2 demonstrates the frequency in which each parameter and aqueous stream was analyzed the samples and physical chemical analyses were conducted over a period of one year these analyses were performed routinely for the industrial unit s operation and their frequencies were related to the respective parameter s relevance to the industrial process it is noteworthy that the number of analyses in this paper is quite high and that some parameters were analyzed daily thus increasing the reliability of the data herein 3 results and discussion 3 1 types of water used in the industry the following describes the different types of water produced and the processes that use the waters with different characteristics the water used in the industry is collected from the caí river municipality of triunfo in southern brazil and is treated in a water treatment station wts the caí river s raw water pumping station is located approximately two kilometers from the wts the waters treated and used by the various consumers are described in the following 3 1 1 clarified water this water is obtained by coagulation followed by flocculation it is used in the industry to refill the cooling water system and the heavy ash handling water system of ash resulting from the burning of carbon it is also utilized as fire water fig 1 shows a diagram of how clarified water is obtained and applied 3 1 2 demineralized water the demineralized water produced in the industry may be obtained through ion exchange and reverse osmosis processes that operate in parallel and even undergo a final polishing in mixed resin cationic and anionic recipients the water is then converted into high pressure steam which expands into a mechanical setup and sets a turbine into motion thus transforming mechanical energy into electrical energy this water must have an appropriate quality so that there are no problems in the steam generating equipment once the produced steam s mechanical and thermal energy has been used it condenses in heat exchangers and is again used as demineralized water after passing through activated coal beds and cationic and anionic resins fig 2 presents a diagram of how demineralized water is produced and applied 3 1 3 ash handling water ash handling water operates in a semi closed system coal burning in boilers to produce steam generates large quantities of heavy ash that needs to be removed it is removed by a hydropneumatic system that drags the ash to a passage tank through which the suspended ashes are pumped to a sedimentation basin which aims to decant heavy ash the water resulting from this process still goes through a polishing basin for new sedimentation and is then pumped for more ash handling this system s inefficiencies require the use of clarified water to supply the volume needed for this purpose fig 3 illustrates this system 3 1 4 fire water clarified water is employed to maintain pressure in the firefighting network there is an exclusive reserve for this purpose that enables a continuous supply of clarified water to fight fires during 4 h with raw water being supplied directly from the river without a time limit 3 1 5 bearing water bearing water aims to cool the bearings in rotational equipment there are two systems to supply this water in the industry identified in this paper as bearing water 1 and bearing water 2 these two bearing water systems functions and characteristics are similar differing only in the supply of water to the industry s distinct areas to maintain this water s physical and chemical parameters within the required specifications purges are made to the system for treating organic effluents along with simultaneous refills with filtered water 3 1 6 filtered water filtered water is obtained by treating clarified water in sand filters this water is utilized as service water and to refill the bearing water system and part of its volume is subsequently chlorinated to produce drinking water 3 1 7 drinking water drinking water is produced by filtering clarified water with the subsequent dosage of chlorine and sodium carbonate to correct ph this water is used for sanitary purposes bathroom sink and kitchen discharges and human consumption 3 1 8 cooling water as the elevation in temperature may compromise the system s performance and damage equipment this water is used to remove heat from reactive mixtures or from other devices that demand cooling due to thermal energy generation or the operation conditions set forth among the various existing cooling processes the industry employs the cooling tower model cooling towers make use of evaporation and heat transfer processes to cool water in this system large volumes of water are needed to refill losses that occur mainly through evaporation drags in the air stream and purges due to salt concentration an effect arising from evaporation of part of the system s water 20 in the industry in question clarified water is used to refill these losses this consumption refers to the sum of two portions 1 refilling waters for purging so as to maintain salt concentration in the cooling water within the limits of interest purges are made continuously 2 losses resulting from evaporation and dragging processes splashes the industry s cooling water system includes four cooling towers and a network of more than 200 heat exchangers distributed throughout the processing areas 3 1 9 service water service water is a distribution network of filtered water this water is used to clean floors and factory equipment and punctually applied to cool processing streams among others 3 1 10 treated effluent effluents generated in the petrochemical industry under analysis are divided into three different streams organic from purges in the production processes sanitary from administrative areas dressing rooms bathrooms and restaurants and inorganic from purges in the cooling towers the organic effluent goes through primary treatment in the industry which includes the removal of light and heavy oil the sanitary effluent is measured in a parshall flume and joins the processing organic effluent in order to be sent to the effluent treatment station ets the inorganic effluent is only measured in a parshall flume and sent to the ets in the ets the organic effluent goes through a grating to remove thick solids and then through an oil separator before it is sent to an equalization basin in this basin the organic and sanitary effluents are homogenized by mechanical agitators and then treated with activated sludge after this treatment the effluent is transported to two decanters in this moment the sludge is sedimented and directed to the densification tank and subsequent deposition in sludge farms the effluent goes through gravity filters and then joins the inorganic effluent that was previously neutralized this final stream is sent to a series of eight polishing lakes that make up a total area of 56 ha and an average depth of 1 5 m the treated effluent goes through all the lakes during a period of thirty to sixty days finally the treated effluent is sprinkled over the soil where it undergoes new stabilization before reaching the river through the water table 3 2 limiting concentrations to evaluate the possibility of reuse it is necessary to establish the limiting concentrations of the parameters controlled in the water these concentrations must be appropriate so that there are no losses to the process during use table 3 depicts the quality standards recommended by authors mierzwa and hespanhol 14 and mancuso and santos 31 who compiled the criteria usually adopted by industries for cooling water and demineralized water used to supply high pressure boilers table 4 shows the maximum and minimum limiting concentrations established by the industry in question for each type of water used in comparing the criteria adopted by the industry to those cited by the authors mierzwa and hespanhol 14 and mancuso and santos 31 the standards of the industry in question for demineralized water are more restrictive than those of the authors for silica iron and ph for cooling water the turbidity alkalinity cod and suspended solid parameters are lower in the industry than those indicated by the authors calcium hardness the sum of chlorides and sulfates silica iron and phosphate are higher in this paper the limiting concentrations established by the industry were used to compare and calculate alternatives for reuse 3 3 characterization of the aqueous streams the following presents the concentration distributions of each parameter evaluated in the different aqueous streams that were studied the chosen parameters are relevant to ensuring the reliability of the company s production processes we emphasize that daily analyses were conducted for several parameters thus promoting greater accuracy of the data presented since conductivity is related to the presence of dissolved ions in the water 32 the sum of the chloride and sulfate concentrations their individual concentrations and the conductivity of the streams are presented as a set in fig 4 the largest concentrations of chlorides a and sulfates b were found in cooling waters and treated effluents with the treated effluent corresponding to the effluent resulting from the last treatment stage in the ets chloride and sulfate concentrations in raw clarified bearing 1 bearing 2 and ash handling waters are within the same order of magnitude there was even a small increase in the concentration of these ions c in clarified water when compared to raw water which is possibly due to the dosage of chemical products which include aluminum sulfate to treat water very similar behavior was observed in the streams conductivity d provoked by the presence of dissolved ions including sulfate and chloride ions in comparing the concentrations of chloride a sulfate b and the conductivity d in the streams to the company s internal reference values the recommended value for conductivity for demineralized water 0 3 μs cm was surpassed while the average concentration was within the limits fig 5 illustrates the concentration of calcium hardness and silica in the different streams both parameters are responsible for encrustations on processing equipment 23 28 it is possible to note three thresholds of concentration for calcium hardness a with the most concentrated streams being cooling towers 1 2 and 3 with averages between 250 and 300 mg l in the following cooling tower 4 ash handling water and the treated effluent demonstrated average concentrations between 100 and 150 mg l raw clarified drinking bearing 1 and 2 and demineralized waters exhibited average concentrations under 50 mg l with demineralized water having the lowest concentration in comparing the concentrations obtained to the limits established by the industry values higher than the standard were observed in the aqueous streams for bearing 1 and 2 for silica b behavior similar to calcium hardness a was identified for the cooling towers treated effluent raw clarified drinking bearing 1 and 2 and demineralized waters for ash handling water a lower threshold was observed for the presence of silica when compared to calcium hardness in comparing the concentrations obtained to the company s internal reference values the recommended value for silica for demineralized water 0 02 mg l was surpassed while the average concentration was within the limits the concentrations of suspended solids and turbidity are presented in fig 6 very similar behavior was identified for both parameters since turbidity is heavily influenced by the presence of suspended solids 30 the greatest concentrations of suspended solids a were found in the treated effluent stream due mainly to the increase of solids with the incorporation of algae and sediment particles in tertiary treatment polishing lakes the cooling towers also presented elevated concentrations for this parameter mainly in towers 1 and 4 with tower 4 exhibiting greater variability in the results clarified and bearing 1 and 2 waters had the lowest concentrations for this parameter despite presenting an average within the same order of magnitude of these waters ash handling water had greater variability in the concentration of suspended solids in comparing the concentrations obtained for suspended solids with the industry s quality standards for cooling water 30 mg l only cooling tower 4 presented values over the standard during the period of the study with its average concentration meeting the standard the greatest concentrations of turbidity b were identified in the treated effluent cooling towers and raw water in comparing the turbidity obtained to the industry s quality standards for cooling water 30 mg l cooling towers 1 and 4 demonstrated values over the limit during the period of evaluation with their average concentrations meeting the standard the maximum concentrations for clarified water and bearing water 1 also exceeded the criteria established by the industry for this parameter 2 mg l and 30 mg l respectively chemical oxygen demand cod a and iron concentration b are presented in fig 7 these parameters are presented as a set in the cod analysis due to the potential influence of inorganic compounds which are oxidizable through potassium dichromate cod and iron concentrations in the streams had a very different profile which indicates that the cod present in the streams is brought on mainly by organic compounds regarding cod the treated effluent presented the greatest concentrations for this parameter followed by cooling tower 4 usually cod and suspended solids are the major parameters of interest for the characterization of industrial wastewater 33 since they are related to treatment efficiency and disposal costs bearing water 2 even exhibited a higher cod average than bearing water 1 which might be related to small hydrocarbon leaks to bearing system 2 in comparing the concentrations obtained to the industry s reference standards the values exceeded the standards recommended by the industry for cooling towers 1 30 mg l and towers 2 3 and 4 25 mg l higher iron concentrations were found in raw water flocculation and decantation processes to obtain clarified water sensitively reduce this element s concentrations more elevated concentrations of these parameters were observed in cooling water an expected phenomenon due to the concentration cycle of the cooling towers employed in the industry and bearing water a phenomenon possibly caused by extant corrosion in this system in comparing the concentrations obtained to the internal standard 3 mg l for cooling water they were surpassed in the four cooling towers for demineralized water and bearing waters 1 and 2 concentrations higher than the internal standard were also detected 0 01 mg l and 2 mg l respectively the ph and alkalinity of the streams are shown in fig 8 the ph a of all the streams fell within a range of 6 0 10 0 in general the cooling towers remained at a threshold above 8 0 and demineralized water remained within a range between 6 0 and 7 0 in comparing the ph values obtained to the industry s internal standards for clarified water 7 0 8 0 cooling water 8 0 8 8 bearing water 7 5 8 5 drinking water 6 0 9 0 and treated effluents 6 0 9 0 some values recorded during the evaluation period were outside of these specifications demineralized water fell within the standard adopted by the industry 6 0 7 0 higher alkalinity was observed for the four cooling towers bearing water 1 and 2 ash handling and treated effluents there was lower alkalinity in raw and clarified waters in comparing the alkalinity values obtained to the industry s internal standards for bearing water 50 mg l bearing water 1 displayed an average alkalinity under the standard fig 9 presents the concentrations of free chlorine used to disinfect drinking water and prevent the development of microorganisms in the cooling water systems a and the concentration of total chlorine in the cooling towers b drinking water systematically presented free chlorine values below those established by ordinance ms 2914 2011 5 mg l and the cooling towers eventually exceeded the upper limit of the total chlorine range recommended by the industry 0 7 1 2 mg l for cooling towers 1 2 and 4 and 0 8 1 5 mg l for cooling tower 3 table 5 shows a summary of the average and maximum concentrations of all the streams evaluated and for all the parameters of interest in this table the values outside the recommended range of use established in this study are marked in bold characterization of the streams and their comparisons to the limiting concentrations demonstrated that the concentrations of some parameters were eventually surpassed this means that reuse alternatives must be implemented along with a systematic follow up of water quality if the quality of the reused water is worse than the quality of the water originally used in the process this may increase the frequency in which the process s limiting concentrations are exceeded generally of the parameters evaluated the water in the four cooling towers had the most elevated concentrations the towers were characterized as water consumers that demand less restrictive quality levels and therefore show great potential for receiving reused water demineralized water requires a higher quality for the water applied consequently it would be difficult to implement reuse for this water consumer 4 conclusions this work s results unveiled that characterization of the process s different aqueous streams is important for a preliminary evaluation of the possibilities of industrial water reuse furthermore establishing limiting criteria for water use in each operation of the production process is a vital step in water reuse implementation as reuse should not compromise the reliability of industrial activities in the case study the comparison of the water qualities with the limiting concentrations of each process illustrates that reuse alternatives must be implanted along with a systematic follow up of water quality since the original process already presents some values that surpass the limiting concentrations established by the industry the water quality examined in each process shows that the cooling towers demand less restrictive quality levels than demineralized water thus the cooling towers have an elevated potential for consuming reused water in this industry acknowledgements the authors would like

14463,the scarcity of water is an increasingly alarming issue all over the world and each sector of society must take action to reduce water use in its activities in chemical and petrochemical industries water is a fundamental resource for the production process this industrial sector has a demand for great quantities of water with specified qualities for each process as the water runs through the industrial processes it incorporates several substances and its characteristics modify it becomes an effluent that must be treated so as to accommodate the emission standards established in the regulations in most cases the standards for disposal are less restrictive than the quality standards for industrial reuse of this effluent if it is not considered for reuse all related activities will be compromised this work presents a case study of a brazilian petrochemical industry where various aqueous streams were characterized to evaluate the quality requirements necessary for water reuse in the production process the work examines water use and the quality of each aqueous stream characterizing them with respect to alkalinity chlorides electrical conductivity chemical oxygen demand total hardness iron ph silica total solids sulfates and turbidity the study demonstrates that the cooling water stream has elevated concentrations for these parameters and thus demands less quality for water reuse in general demineralized water presents the lowest concentrations for the parameters under evaluation and therefore requires greater quality for water reuse keywords water characterization petrochemical industry water reuse 1 introduction the scarcity of water is an increasingly alarming issue throughout the world according to information disclosed by the state of são paulo environmental company cetesb 1 1 2 billion people in the world do not have access to treated water and 1 8 billion people do not have adequate basic sanitation services faced with this shortage problem there is a need to develop strategies to improve water use management in its different applications 2 in the chemical and petrochemical industries water is a fundamental resource to the production process for example in petroleum production and processing units nearly 6 cubic meters of water are used for each cubic meter of processed petroleum 3 for the petrochemical industry evaluated in this work prior studies showed a water consumption of 4 5 m³ t which corresponds to 2333 m³ h of water for application 2 4 in order to reduce water consumption indicators different industrial sectors have been applying water reuse such as refining and petrochemical 5 7 leather industry 8 9 food industry 10 11 among others as the way goes through the industrial processes it incorporates several substances and its characteristics change it becomes an effluent that must be treated in order to fulfill the emission standards in regulations in most cases the standards are less restrictive than the quality requirements for industry applications if these are not taken into consideration for implementing reuse all related activities will be compromised 12 13 the quality of reused water must be sufficiently elevated to prevent problems in production processes such as corrosion in pipes and equipment influenced by various parameters such as dissolved oxygen ph alkalinity the presence of sulfates and chlorides temperature the presence of carbon gas concentration of organic material and other factors mud deposits in heat exchangers iron particle deposits in ion exchange resins among others 14 15 the most relevant physical and chemical parameters to evaluate industrial water reuse are presented in table 1 this work aims to conduct a study on water use and quality in a petrochemical industry by discussing the most relevant quality parameters in the production process this study is fundamentally important since industrial water reuse must attend to the characteristics of each application so as to ensure its safe utilization 2 methodology the present work was developed in a petrochemical industry located in the southern region of brazil this industrial unit is responsible for over 30 of the olefins produced in the country the company processes naphtha a product derived from petroleum and condensed from natural gas to generate basic petrochemicals their main products are ethylene and propylene originating from two olefin units the company also has an aromatic unit that produces benzene butadiene butene hydrogenated c9 methyl tert

water table 3 2 limiting concentrations to evaluate the possibility of reuse it is necessary to establish the limiting concentrations of the parameters controlled in the water these concentrations must be appropriate so that there are no losses to the process during use table 3 depicts the quality standards recommended by authors mierzwa and hespanhol 14 and mancuso and santos 31 who compiled the criteria usually adopted by industries for cooling water and demineralized water used to supply high pressure boilers table 4 shows the maximum and minimum limiting concentrations established by the industry in question for each type of water used in comparing the criteria adopted by the industry to those cited by the authors mierzwa and hespanhol 14 and mancuso and santos 31 the standards of the industry in question for demineralized water are more restrictive than those of the authors for silica iron and ph for cooling water the turbidity alkalinity cod and suspended solid parameters are lower in the industry than those indicated by the authors calcium hardness the sum of chlorides and sulfates silica iron and phosphate are higher in this paper the limiting concentrations established by the industry were used to compare and calculate alternatives for reuse 3 3 characterization of the aqueous streams the following presents the concentration distributions of each parameter evaluated in the different aqueous streams that were studied the chosen parameters are relevant to ensuring the reliability of the company s production processes we emphasize that daily analyses were conducted for several parameters thus promoting greater accuracy of the data presented since conductivity is related to the presence of dissolved ions in the water 32 the sum of the chloride and sulfate

2 and ash handling waters are within the same order of magnitude there was even a small increase in the concentration of these ions c in clarified water when compared to raw water which is possibly due to the dosage of chemical products which include aluminum sulfate to treat water very similar behavior was observed in the streams conductivity d provoked by the presence of dissolved ions including sulfate and chloride ions in comparing the concentrations of chloride a sulfate b and the conductivity d in the streams to the company s internal reference values the recommended value for conductivity for demineralized water 0 3 μs cm was surpassed while the average concentration was within the limits fig 5 illustrates the concentration of calcium hardness and silica in the different streams both parameters are responsible for encrustations on processing equipment 23 28 it is possible to note three thresholds of concentration for calcium hardness a with the most concentrated streams being cooling towers 1 2 and 3 with averages between 250 and 300 mg l in the following cooling tower 4 ash handling water and the treated effluent demonstrated average concentrations between 100 and 150 mg l raw clarified drinking bearing 1 and 2 and demineralized waters exhibited average concentrations under 50 mg l with demineralized water having the lowest concentration in comparing the concentrations obtained to the limits established by the industry values higher than the standard were observed in the aqueous streams for bearing 1 and 2 for silica b behavior similar to calcium hardness a was identified for the cooling towers treated effluent raw clarified drinking bearing 1 and 2 and demineralized waters for ash handling water a lower threshold was observed for the presence of silica when compared to calcium hardness in comparing the concentrations obtained to the company s internal reference values the recommended value for silica for demineralized water 0 02 mg l was surpassed while the average concentration was within the limits the concentrations of suspended solids and turbidity are presented in fig 6 very similar behavior was identified for both parameters since turbidity is heavily influenced by the presence of suspended solids 30 the greatest concentrations of suspended solids a were found in the treated effluent stream due mainly to the increase of solids with the incorporation of algae and sediment particles in tertiary treatment polishing lakes the cooling towers also presented elevated concentrations for this parameter mainly in towers 1 and 4 with tower 4 exhibiting greater variability in the results clarified and bearing 1 and 2 waters had the lowest concentrations for this parameter despite presenting an average within the same order of magnitude of these waters ash handling water had greater variability in the concentration of suspended solids in comparing the concentrations obtained for suspended solids with the industry s quality standards for cooling water 30 mg l only cooling tower 4 presented values over the standard during the period of the study with its average concentration meeting the standard the greatest concentrations of turbidity b were identified in the treated effluent cooling towers and raw water in comparing the turbidity obtained to the industry s quality standards for cooling water 30 mg l cooling towers 1 and 4 demonstrated values over the limit during the period of evaluation with their average concentrations meeting the standard the maximum concentrations for clarified water and bearing water 1 also exceeded the criteria established by the industry for this parameter 2 mg l and 30 mg l respectively chemical oxygen demand cod a and iron concentration b are presented in fig 7 these parameters are presented as a set in the cod analysis due to the potential influence of inorganic compounds which are oxidizable through potassium dichromate cod and iron concentrations in the streams had a very different profile which indicates that the cod present in the streams is brought on mainly by organic compounds regarding cod the treated effluent presented the greatest concentrations for this parameter followed by cooling tower 4 usually cod and suspended solids are the major parameters of interest for the characterization of industrial wastewater 33 since they are related to treatment efficiency and disposal costs bearing water 2 even exhibited a higher cod average than bearing water 1 which might be related to small hydrocarbon leaks to bearing system 2 in comparing the concentrations obtained to the industry s reference standards the values exceeded the standards recommended by the industry for cooling towers 1 30 mg l and towers 2 3 and 4 25 mg l higher iron concentrations were found in raw water flocculation and decantation processes to obtain clarified water sensitively reduce this element s concentrations more elevated concentrations of these parameters were observed in cooling water an expected phenomenon due to the concentration cycle of the cooling towers employed in the industry and bearing water a phenomenon possibly caused by extant corrosion in this system in comparing the concentrations obtained to the internal standard 3 mg l for cooling water they were surpassed in the four cooling towers for demineralized water and bearing waters 1 and 2 concentrations higher than the internal standard were also detected 0 01 mg l and 2 mg l respectively the ph and alkalinity of the streams are shown in fig 8 the ph a of all the streams fell within a range of 6 0 10 0 in general the cooling towers remained at a threshold above 8 0 and demineralized water remained within a range between 6 0 and 7 0 in comparing the ph values

mg l for cooling tower 3 table 5 shows a summary of the average and maximum concentrations of all the streams evaluated and for all the parameters of interest in this table the values outside the recommended range of use established in this study are marked in bold characterization of the streams and their comparisons to the limiting concentrations demonstrated that the concentrations of some parameters were eventually surpassed this means that reuse alternatives must be implemented along with a systematic follow up of water quality if the quality of the reused water is worse than the quality of the water originally used in the process this may increase the frequency in which the process s limiting concentrations are exceeded generally of the parameters evaluated the water in the four cooling towers had the most elevated concentrations the towers were characterized as water consumers that demand less restrictive quality levels and therefore show great potential for receiving reused water demineralized water requires a higher quality for the water applied consequently it would be difficult to implement reuse for this water consumer 4 conclusions this work s results unveiled that characterization of the process s different aqueous streams is important for a preliminary evaluation of the possibilities of industrial water reuse furthermore establishing limiting criteria for water use in each operation of the production process is a vital step in water reuse implementation as reuse should not compromise the reliability of industrial activities in the case study the comparison of the water qualities with the limiting concentrations of each process illustrates that reuse alternatives must be implanted along with a systematic follow up of water quality since the original process already presents some values that surpass the limiting concentrations established by the industry the water quality examined in each process shows that the cooling towers demand less restrictive quality levels than demineralized water thus the cooling towers have an elevated potential for consuming reused water in this industry acknowledgements the authors would like

wells and springs and 159 million people are using untreated surface water around the world 1 drinking water sources are being polluted by microorganisms inorganic and organic materials anthropogenic activities as well as naturally occurring metals in soil fe and mn may be the sources of heavy metals in surface waters 2 according to an analysis pardo river brazil showed metal ion concentrations for as be cd cr cu hg mn ni pb sn tl zn ranging from 0 2 to 252 38 μg l 3 according to another study cu fe pb mn cr ni are the most common metals concentrations are in the range of 0 05 3 5 mg l that can be found in surface water depending on the industrialization industrial solid waste dumping and seasonal changes 4 another study found that in rivers the concentrations of cr cu as ni pb cd ions were ranging from 8 to 83 μg l 5 in addition to metal pollution in water sources suspended and colloidal solids in water can result in microbiologically unsafe water due to hosting and leading the growth of pathogens on their surfaces 6 7 absent inadequate or inappropriate management of drinking water can cause morbidity and mortality in underdeveloped and developing countries exposure to high nickel concentration causes lung nose and bone cancers 8 even though copper is an essential micronutrient for human body it is toxic at high concentrations causing anemia incremental risk of lung cancer and stomach intestinal distress 9 zinc is also an essential element needed for body however high concentrations can lead to damages in the pancreas and it can cause anemia and decreased levels of high density lipoprotein hdl cholesterol 10 iron can lead to coronary health diseases 11 e coli and total coliforms can cause intestinal illnesses according to the who report 842 000 people including 361 000 children under 5 years old die each year from diarrhea due to unsafe drinking water consumption 1 therefore point of use systems are utmost important to bring adequate and safe drinking water for people in need the biosand filter bsf is a slow sand filter modified for household needs to treat water by dr david manz in 1990s and it has been in use around the world since then 12 15 filter design consists of gravel pea gravel and sand layers consecutively physical and biologic treatments are the main steps to treat the water in bsf water filters through sand and gravel then enters the underdrain the biological layer formed on the top of the sand breaks down organic particles and preys on microorganism andparticles are strained out by sand from water 12 16 18 bsf can remove 73 95 of fe 25 of dissolved organic carbon 90 of organic and inorganic materials 47 of ar 70 of turbidity 40 of ca 50 of mg 50 of ar 18 of no3 21 of po4 from the water 11 12 19 21 since the first bsf development the design of filter has been modified by either amending extra adsorbent media between layers or changing hydraulic head hydraulic loading pore volume size of the media depth of the filter media 22 28 the viruses bacteria protozoa turbidity total organic carbon toc chemical oxygen demand cod and some metal ions removal by modified biosand filters mbsfs amended additional adsorbent media were reported in different studies 11 29 33 iron oxide amended bsf small scale glass column removed 5log10 ms2 bacteriophage and full scale bsfs with iron particles removed 4log10 ms2 bacteriophage 34 biosand filter amended with 26 cm height of activated carbon and 36 cm height of zeolite removed 98 of ammonium 98 of pb 97 of cod and 87 of phosphate 35 vinegar amended anaerobic bsf removed 100 of ammonia and 50 of arsenic 36 iron oxide coated sand mbsf removed 99 3 of bacteria and 90 of turbidity 29 pinus bark biomass added bsf removed 93 2 and 95 3 reductions of e coli and total coliforms 37 zeolite enriched mbsf removed 80 of ca 89 of mg 99 of fe 56 of ar 54 of fl 96 of turbidity 37 of nitrates and 41 of toc 19 it was shown that mbsf enriched with melia azedarach biomass removed 97 9 99 9 of fe 31 61 of pb concentrations between 2 6 mg l and 100 of escherichia coli e coli 33 mbsf enriched with brass removed 90 11 of total coliforms 98 2 of e coli 88 5 of turbidity mbsf enriched with zero valent iron zvi removed 98 of total coliforms 98 2 of e coli and 95 of turbidity 38 39 another study employing bsf enriched with zvi removed 99 of total coliforms fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci 40 the available literature is still inadequate in order to evaluate the performance of bsf and mbsf in removing heavy metals organic and inorganic contaminants which may present in source water and directly affect the human health therefore the purpose of this study is to investigate the performance of mbsf enriched with iron oxide coated gravel iocg to remove organic matter with reference to toc cod turbidity total coliforms e coli and different concentrations of metals ni fe cu zn from source water the effects of filter media on the efficiency of filters were taken into consideration to analyze the contaminant removal mechanisms iocg was incorporated as an extra adsorbent layer to improve the removal efficiencies of metal ions based on the results of previous studies iocg in a batch study removed 99 72 of pb ii 99 61 of cu ii 99 51 of cd ii 99 3 of fe iii and 93 3 of al iii iocg in a fixed bed column removed 96 5 of cu ii 94 8 of pb ii 90 of cd ii 84 of fe iii and 67 of al iii 41 the degree of metal adsorption by iocg at ph 7 in batch reactors followed the order of cu ii 99 62 cd ii 99 61 fe ii 98 90 zn ii 90 4 ni ii 83 8 42 in addition to metal removal efficiency mbsfs were evaluated for ph dissolved oxygen do flowrate and conductivity performance as well two drinking water standards world health organization who and gulf cooperation council gcc were used to evaluate the performance of mbsfs since total coliforms e coli or thermo tolerant fecal coliforms bacteria counts are the only monitored microbial parameter by who and gcc total coliforms and e coli were chosen as two microbial parameters monitored in this study 43 44 ni fe cu and zn were chosen as the monitored metal ions due their prevalence in surface water 2 materials and methods 2 1 filter setup four laboratory scale acrylic flow cells with 3 81 cm inner diameter and 55 cm height with duplicates were prepared to construct filters the control mbsf filters were filled consecutively with gravel pea granular gravel and coarse sand for setting up the three layers of underdrain and filled with fine sand as fourth layer the mbsfs with iocg consisted of gravel iocg coarse sand and fine sand local sand was chosen as mbsf media there are three types of sand available in the united arab emirates uae white yellow and red sand all types of sand were obtained locally and sieved with a humboldt sieve shaker after the sieve analysis only red sand samples gave the required uniformity coefficient d60 d10 2 defined by centre for affordable water and sanitation technology cawst and another study uniformity coefficient for sand placed in bsf should be between 1 5 2 5 and effective size d10 should be between 0 15 to 0 3 12 45 therefore red sand was chosen as bsf media another study reported that the uae red sand is composed of 300 μm particles whereas white and yellow sand are in the range of 150 300 μm 46 characterization of iocg using scanning electron microscope sem energy dispersive x ray edx x ray diffraction xrd and brunauer emmett teller bet surface area analysis was reported and explained in our previous studies in detail 41 42 gravel was purchased from marinara transport abu dhabi and sieved with a humboldt sieve shaker sieved sand and gravel were washed and dried in an oven iocg was prepared according to a procedure explained in the previous studies 41 42 the filter were set with the following layers of media 4 cm of gravel size 12 5 mm 4 cm of pea granular gravel iocg size 2 36 mm 2 cm coarse sand size 1 18 mm and 40 cm fine sand with effective size d10 0 297 mm d60 0 6 mm based on a previous study full size structure shown in fig 1 39 the outlet tube pvc tubing with 0 5 cm inner diameter was elevated 4 cm above the top of the filter media a diffuser having holes with 2 mm of diameters was used to distribute source water evenly on the filter media and it was placed 5 cm above the top of the filter media the standing water was maintained 3 cm above the filter media during the pause period the volume of the filled column was 1 15 l sand gravel water with a void space of 0 35 l to avoid air between voids filters were filled with water before adding any media the porosity of the sand was found to be 0 26 the filters were run intermittently twice a day with 12 h pause period with 0 7 l of water for 64 days the average flow rates were 0 015 l min 0 78 m h for mbsf iocg and 0 020 l min 1 05 m h for mbsf control these values were in the prescribed range 0 16 1 1 m h 30 45 the water temperature was 24 2 c during the study 2 2 synthetic water preparation and microbiology a wastewater sample as microbial seeding solution was obtained from the second clarifier of a local wastewater treatment plant abu dhabi uae the wastewater activated sludge was transferred to a laboratory scale aeration tank and fed by a solution of synthetic wastewater this procedure is adopted from a previous study 47 1 l of tap water was seeded with 1 ml of the activated sludge and 2 mg l or 5 mg l of cu fe zn and ni as synthetic source water to study contaminant removal performance of filters cu fe zn and ni solutions were prepared using zncl2 nicl2 6h2o cuso4 5h2o feso4 7h2o supplied by fisher scientific changing the concentrations of metals in the influent samples led to changes in the turbidity level ph and specific conductance turbidity in the influent was measured to be 4 2 1 38 nephelometric turbidity unit ntu for 2 mg l of influent metal concentrations and 10 41 2 34 ntu for 5 mg l of influent metal concentrations the average value of ph of the influent water was 6 5 for 2 mg l metal concentrations and 6 94 for 5 mg l metal concentrations the average value of the conductivity of the influent was 167 97 μs cm for 2 mg l influent metal concentration and 192 6 μs cm for 5 mg l influent metal concentration organic matter removal was evaluated with reference to cod and toc different concentrations of metals in the influent did not affect the initial cod or toc concentrations cod was measured to be 70 28 57 mg l and toc was measured to be 31 66 5 83 mg l in the synthetic source water different concentrations of heavy metals did not affect the initial bacterial counts do levels and flow rate total number of the total coliforms in the influent was maintained at 15 035 8842 colony forming unit cfu 100 ml and e coli was maintained at 1850 3248 cfu 100 ml during the study the numbers of e coli and total coliforms and concentrations of metals in the water were determined before and after the filtration process 2 3 bacterial and physicochemical analysis grab samples were collected from the outlet tubes daily weekdays and tested immediately for ph conductivity and dissolved oxygen a number of different samples were tested on different intervals on a daily weekdays basis for flow rate and biweekly basis for turbidity e coli total coliforms metals toc and cod sterile containers were placed under the outlet tubes and filled with the effluent water until the filtration was complete approximately 28 30 minutes the samples were well mixed before the analyses all analyses were carried on in one hour after the collection standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 9222 d membrane filtration method was used to analyze e coli and total coliforms 48 turbidity was measured using thermo scientific eutech tn100 turbidity meter specific conductance ph and do were measured using hach hq40d portable multi meter metals were determined using atomic absorption spectrometer varian fs220 cod was determined using hach lck 314 cod vials digested in hach drb200 digital reactor and measured using hach dr6000 uv vis spectrophotometer toc was determined using hach lck 386 vials centrifuged in toc x5 shaker and measured using hach dr600 uv vis spectrophotometer with rfid technology 2 4 data analysis all measurements were run in duplicates and the arithmetic mean standard deviation and minimum and maximum values were calculated for all data sets percent removal values were calculated using the following formula influent effluent influent x100 1 log reduction was calculated in addition to percent removal for e coli and total coliforms removal the student s t test two tailed was used to determine whether or not mbsf control and mbsf iocg data are significantly different from each other for contaminant removal 2 5 regeneration study after 64 days of experimental analysis filters were emptied and filter media were washed with tap water and dried in an oven and placed back to filter columns filters ran for 50 days and fed with 5 mg l initial metal concentrations mixed with 1 ml of activated sludge as synthetic source water and when flow rate slowed down the experiments were stopped bi weekly analysis were performed for e coli total coliforms metals toc and cod to analyze second cycle of the mbsfs performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 flow rate the average flow rates were 0 015 l min for mbsf control and 0 020 l min for mbsf iocg throughout the study which were in the acceptable range stated by elliott et al 30 as previously discussed in the filter design section a decline in the flow rate over time was observed due to filter maturation fouling because of large size pathogens parasites cysts and suspended solids trapped between sand particles compression of the filter media and the increment of head loss of the system for mbsf control and mbsf iocg as shown in fig 2 33 38 39 the sequence of the average flow rates was observed as mbsf iocg mbsf control the flow rates highly depended on the sand grain distribution sand depth and quality of raw water 40 45 3 2 ph and conductivity the average ph value of the influent water having 2 mg l metal concentrations was 6 53 which slightly increased to an average of 7 3 for the mbsf control and 7 12 for the mbsf iocg effluents the average ph value of the influent water with 5 mg l metal concentrations was 6 94 and it increased to 7 48 for the mbsf control and 7 57 for mbsf iocg as listed in table 1 since both filters produced similar results in terms of ph the data related to change of ph over time was plotted only for the filters with 2 mg l influent metal concentration in fig 3 a for the filters with 2 mg l influent metal concentrations the average value of the conductivity of the influent was 167 97 μs cm and it increased to an average of 2627 μs cm for the mbsf iocg and 268 1 μs cm for the mbsf control effluents in the same way for the filters with 5 mg l influent metal concentrations the average value of the conductivity of the influent was 192 6 μs cm and it increased to an average of 263 μs cm for the mbsf iocg and 254 μs cm for the mbsf control since both filters showed similar results in terms specific conductance only the conductance versus time data for 2 mg l filters was given and plotted in fig 3b and table 1 slightly increased effluent ph values and considerable conductivity differences between influent and effluent samples pointed out that some monovalent ions k na on sand surface can react with water 37 previous studies showed that gravel surface consisted of ca 2 mg 2 and iocg surface consisted of ca 2 mg 2 fe 3 and cl ions 41 42 49 another study reported that al 3 51 mg g sand fe 5 038 mg g sand k 0 953 mg g sand mg 9 78 mg g sand ca 173 4 mg g sand na 0 396 mg g sand and ni 0 045 mg g sand are abundant in red sand in the uae washing sand samples does not remove ca and na and during the operation of filter na and ca leaching causes higher ph and conductivity values 46 in addition to ion leaching dissolution of carbonate species from the sand contributes to ph and conductivity increment in effluents 37 50 3 3 dissolved oxygen it was found that the average value of the do in the influent was 8 04 mg l average values of 7 mg l do for mbsf iocg and 6 97 mg l do for mbsf control effluents were measured as shown in fig 4 and table 1 high do values in effluents indicated that aerobic condition was dominant throughout the filter beds the sequence of do rates in filters effluents was mbsfiocg mbsf control do concentrations were almost constant and this reflects that do in influent water was consumed by the biological layer up to 1 mg l which was less than the previously reported studies 29 51 aeration during the sampling at the outlet and using lab scale filter columns might have caused higher do concentrations 39 3 4 metal removal the concentrations of metals in the influent were kept as 2 mg l and 5 mg l for each metal for the study the average effluent concentrations on mbsf iocg for 2 mg l of initial metal concentrations were observed to be 0 014 mg l for cu 0 076 mg l for zn 0 029 mg l for ni 0 098 mg l for fe ii the average metal removals with mbsf iocg having 2 mg l influent metal concentrations were observed to be cu 99 27 zn 99 1 ni 98 61 fe ii 95 28 the average metal ion concentrations in the effluent with mbsf control 2 mg l were as following 0 016 mg l for cu 0 057 mg l for zn 0 039 mg l for ni and 0 095 for fe ii the average metal removals on mbsf control 2 mg l were observed to be cu 99 zn 99 1 ni 98 17 fe ii 95 27 the average metal ion concentrations in the effluent with mbsf iocg having 5 mg l of influent metal concentrations were observed to be 0 068 mg l

concentrations with mbsf control having 5 mg l of influent metal ion concentrations were observed as following 0 082 mg l for cu 0 10 mg l for zn 0 036 mg l for ni and 0 020 for fe ii the average metal ion removal performance with mbsf control 5 mg l were observed to be cu 98 2 zn 99 ni 94 0 fe ii 92 33 as shown in fig 5 a b c d respectively and explained in table 2 the effluent metal ion concentrations observed for both filters were below the limits set by who iron 0 1 mg l copper 1 mg l zinc 5 mg l and nickel 0 07 mg l and gcc iron 0 2 mg l copper 1 mg l zinc 5 mg l and nickel 0 07

statistically significant between mbsf control and mbsf iocg 5 mg l for cu p 0 27 zn p 0 99 ni p 0 077 and fe ii p 0 73 removals after 50 days all metal removal rates decreased except cu indicating pores were saturated with metals in both mbsf control and mbsf iocg media the affinity of the media through cu was reported in previous studies 41 42 49 increasing dosage caused slight decrease on removal rates metal removals in mbsfs were in the order of cu zn ni fe ii implying a correlation with the metal solubility values except ni pksp cu 19 3 zn 16 5 fe ii 16 3 ni 15 2 nickel s higher removal rate than zinc could be explained by collective effects of the metal ions hydrated ionic radius hydration energies and electronegativity metals with smaller ionic radii tend to have higher hydration numbers and this in turn can lead to larger hydrated radii and inefficient adsorption hydrated radius ni 4 04 ao zn 4 3 ao cu 4 19 ao fe 4 28 ao 52 54 on the other hand as the electronegativity degree of an atom s ability to attract the electrons in a covalent bond of the metal cations increase the resulting bond between the metal cation and the oxygen atom on the mineral surface becomes stronger on the basis of these considerations ni having smaller hydrated radius and higher electronegativity as compared to fe ii adsorbed more electronegativity cu 1 9 zn 1 6 fe ii 1 8 ni 1 9 55 56 fe ii removal rate was in parallel with the other studies a study achieved 65 of iron removal by the bsf another study showed that bsf removed 97 9 99 99 of iron from source water 33 similarly it was reported that mbsf with zeolite layer removed 99 of the iron with an initial 0 4 mg l iron concentration 19 the mechanism of iron removal by bsf was reported to be occurring in the biolayer zone in which iron oxidizing microorganisms such as gallionella sp biologically oxidize soluble iron ii into insoluble iron iii oxides 57 58 aeration process in the filters which was observed to have occurred during the time of the study explained above in the do section could be another reason of oxidation of soluble iron ii into insoluble iron iii 19 59 since sand and gravel showed remarkable potentials to remove heavy metals in many studies metal removals by mbsf can be explained by used filter media a study showed that sand column was able to remove 71 87 of the varying concentrations of zn 25 100 ppm in the solution 60 it was shown that silty sand in column analysis revealed an adsorption capacity order as zn cu ni 61 sand filter showed 99 6 of cu removal due to adsorption entanglement of heavy metals by organic matters organic ligands at the top layer simple adsorption to organic matter and sand in the middle layer and chemical adsorption to the sand surface at the deeper layer 62 according to another study the order of the amount of metal adsorbed on the sand was pb cr cu zn 63 another study reported that gravel was able to remove cu ii 98 fe ii 87 5 zn ii 76 05 ni ii 36 38 in single metal solution studies cu ii 98 3 fe ii 83 zn ii 48 ni ii 27 32 in mixed metal solution studies at ph 7 49 gravel was able to remove 44 73 of ni 46 70 of zn 45 75 of cu at initial ph 7 and final ph 8 5 81 in addition rinsed microgabbro gravel removed 90 of zn 64 the major mechanisms for metal removal in mbsf were protonation de protonation of sand ion exchange adsorption onto sand gravel settlement binding of the metals to the biofilm and microbial uptake 46 62 65 the process of ion exchange occurred in the pores of sand gravel having localized charged groups the dissolved ionic species causes the displacement of anions or cations which are electrostatically bound to charged groups on the surface while maintaining the charge balance the following metal ions and counter anions ca2 mg2 h k nh4 al 3 so4 2 cl no3 on the sand and gravel were displaced by heavy metals 40 49 66 67 the major contributor to the adsorption process for the metal ions was found to be the surface hydroxyl groups in silica the edge hydroxyl groups and the oxygen atoms attached to tetrahedral silicon atoms interact with heavy metals through lewis acid base interaction and the chemisorption of metal ions are facilitated furthermore adsorption process accelerates for metal cations as a result of higher hydrolysis rates smaller ionic size high polarizability and high charge density 63 66 varying ph of solution played a significant role to remove metal ions by precipitation it is known that zn presents as zn2 in solution up to ph 8 8 68 69 cu2 is the dominant species at low ph values up to ph 5 8 beyond ph 5 8 copper ii hydroxide cu oh 2 is the dominant species up to ph 12 3 4 68 the solubility of ni ii decreases significantly beyond ph 9 0 70 in alkaline solutions fe ii ions form fe oh 2 s precipitate 41 42 it is necessary to conduct further studies to elaborate the possible mechanism s involved in the removal of metal ions through bsf it was observed that adding iocg to mbsf setup did not improve metal removal efficiency placing an extra adsorbent layer at the lower parts of the filter may not be effective because all possible removal mechanisms might have already taken place as the source water reached the lower parts of the filter 3 5 turbidity removal influents and effluents from each filter were compared for turbidity the average influent turbidity was 4 2 1 38 ntu for 2 mg l inlet metal concentrations a 92 66 reduction with an average of 0 33 ntu effluent turbidity for mbsf control and a 90 5 reduction with an average of 0 35 ntu effluent turbidity for mbsf iocg were observed the average influent turbidity was 10 41 2 34 ntu for 5 mg l inlet metal concentrations a 96 37 reduction with an average of 0 37 ntu effluent turbidity for mbsf control and a 95 84 reduction with an average of 0 41 ntu effluent turbidity for mbsf iocg were observed as shown in fig 6 and as explained in table 2 turbidity was caused by suspended and insoluble species which were removed by both filters efficiently to the approximately same level regardless of the initial turbidity concentrations the main mechanism of turbidity removal by mbsfs was surface straining by sand particles as well as other processes such as interception sedimentation and adsorption on bio layer 19 71 the two tailed t test was not statistically significant at the 0 05 level between mbsf control and mbsf iocg p 0 38 0 18 for 2 mg l and 5 mg l respectively the sequence of turbidity removal was observed as mbsf control mbsf iocg it was reported in other studies that bsf and mbsfs removed 70 98 of turbidity 11 29 30 38 40 45 all turbidity levels from all filters were below who and gcc drinking water quality standards 5 ntu and 4 ntu respectively 43 72 3 6 cod and toc removal initial cod concentrations were 70 mg l for each filter an average of 49 3 of cod removal with 33 87 mg l of effluent cod concentration was observed for the mbsf iocg an average of 46 34 of cod removal with 35 8 mg l effluent cod concertation was observed for the mbsf control as shown in fig 7 a and table 2 the two tailed t test at the 0 05 level was not significant between mbsf control and mbsf iocg p 0 18 both filters produced higher removal rates after 20 days of filter operation cod removal rates were in parallel with the other studies sand filters with 0 65 m and 0 35 m depth removed 45 and 44 of cod respectively 73 in the same fashion another study showed 46 6 of cod reduction by modified sand filter 74 lower cod removal rates by sand filters can be explained on the basis of the media used water characteristics hydraulic loads and ph of solution according to some studies high hydraulic rates and different ph values might result in lower cod removal rates 75 77 initial toc concentrations were 31 66 mg l for each filter an average of 16 38 mg l effluent toc concentration with 49 65 removal efficiency was observed for the mbsf iocg an average of 16 39 mg l effluent toc concentration with 48 36 removal efficiency was observed for the mbsf control as shown in fig 7b and table 2 the two tailed t test at the 0 05 level was not significant between mbsf control and mbsf iocg p 0 98 similar to cod removal efficiencies both filters produced higher removal rates after 20 days of operation and this indicated that the biological layer formed at the top of filter started to consume more carbonaceous material from source water likewise another study using bsf enriched with zeolites showed 41 of toc removal rate 19 although the safety limits for cod and toc for drinking water were not defined in who or gcc drinking water standards united states environmental protection agency usepa set the toc limit for treated water prior to chlorination less than 2 0 mg l 78 therefore more studies should focus on organic material removal by mbsfs the cod and toc reduction order was observed to be mbsf iocg mbsf control 3 7 total coliforms and e coli removals the reduction of total coliforms averaged log 0 33 49 75 for mbsf control and log 0 42 60 98 for mbsf iocg from day 0 to day 20 the two tailed t test at the 0 05 level was not significant between mbsf control and mbsf iocg p 0 24 the biological layer maturation period took 20 days which was similar to the ones that were found in other studies 39 38 23 from day 20 onward an average of log 2 07 94 21 reduction for mbsf control and log 2 23 95 33 reduction for mbsf iocg were observed as shown in fig 8 a and table 2 the two tailed t test at the 0 05 level was not statistically significant between mbsf control and mbsf iocg p 0 073 the removal performance increased over the time the range of the total coliforms removal efficiencies for the filters was in parallel with the other studies performed for bsf and mbsf with a range from 90 to 99 29 30 38 40 45 e coli reductions averaged log 1 52 94 2 for the mbsf control log 1 61 95 43 for the mbsf iocg from day 0 until day 20 the two tailed t test was not statistically significant at the 0 05 level between mbsf control and mbsf iocg p 0 206 e coli removal order of percentages for the filters during the biological layer maturation period were observed as mbsf iocg mbsf control the average e coli removal percentages from day 20 onward were observed as log 2 04 98 07 reduction for mbsf control and log 2 2 99 reduction for mbsf iocg as shown in fig 8b and table 2 the two tailed t test at the 0 05 level was not significant between mbsf control and mbsf iocg p 0 21 after ripening period the sequence of e coli reduction was observed as mbsf iocg mbsf control the range of the e coli removal efficiencies for filters in this study was in parallel with other studies performed for bsf and mbsf iron filters with a range of 93 99 29 30 38 79 80 throughout the experiments mbsfs accomplished 99 microbial reduction after biological layer maturation period the sequence of total coliforms and e coli reduction was observed as mbsf iocg mbsf control the removal performance of e coli and total coliforms increased with the time suggesting maturation of biofilm all filters produced slightly lower removal performances after 60 days adsorption straining by sand natural die off and predation are the principal mechanism to remove microorganisms from source water although mbsfs reached 99 removal rates the numbers of e coli and total coliforms in the effluent were exceeding who and gcc drinking water standards according to who and gcc standards bacteria counts should be zero in a 100 ml sample 43 44 mbsf iocg produced slightly higher percent removalof e coli and total coliforms than mbsf control removal in the mbsf iocg was achieved primarily due to both the germicidal effect of iron coating on gravel and the biofilm formation 40 3 8 regeneration results the analysis of the regeneration studies showed that in the second cycle after the regeneration of filters filters still provided higher removal rates as shown in fig 9 the average removals with mbsf iocg after the regeneration were observed to be cu 98 53 zn 96 82 ni 92 26 fe ii 91 2 turbidity 91 76 cod 50 toc 43 65 the average removal rates in the descending order with the mbsf control after the regeneration were observed to be cu 98 55 zn 96 32 ni 90 38 fe ii 90 83 turbidity 91 63 cod 49 0 toc 43 67 4 conclusion the filters were operated intermittently for 64 days and the physicochemical and biological tests were conducted to compare the performances of the mbsfs for organic matter bacteria and different metal concentrations taking into account the filter media a decline in the flow rate over the time was observed due to the biological layer maturation and fouling in both types of filters the turbidity in the effluent water for both filters was below who and gcc drinking water standards slightly increased effluent ph and considerable differences of the influent and effluent conductivity indicated that the sand particles contain some monovalent ions as well carbonates the removal performance of e coli total coliforms cod and toc increased with the time suggesting biofilm maturation and consumption of bacteria and carbonaceous material by the biofilm increasing initial metal concentrations from 2 mg l to 5 mg l slightly decreased the filters removal capacity metal removals in mbsfs were in the order of cu zn ni fe ii the effluent metal concentrations were below who and gcc drinking water permissible limits in both filters for both concentrations the major mechanisms for the metal removal in the mbsfs were protonation deprotonation of the sand ion exchange adsorption to sand gravel settlement binding of the metals to the biofilm and microbial uptake in this respect this study highlighted the probable removal mechanism in the mbsf through analyzing every filter layers function for the contaminant removal although addition of iocg did not make any significant improvement in terms of reduction of turbidity metals cod toc e coli and total coliforms mbsf iocg achieved better cod toc e coli total coliforms cu and ni removal percentages placing an extra adsorbent layer at the lower parts of the filter was found to be not effective in terms of the removal performance this can be attributed to the fact that all possible adsorption processes might have occurred and removed the contaminants till the moment the source water reached the lower part of the filter after the regeneration of the filters on the second cycle of the study the removal efficiencies were observed to be still high this study showed that with the help of mbsfs metal and turbidity levels could be reduced to the permissible drinking water levels however mbsfs did not reduce cod toc and bacteria to the permissible levels although this study was a lab scale mbsf removal rates of bacteria and turbidiy were similar to the full scale mbsf a previous study therefore future studies can be directed to improve the efficiency of mbsf to eliminate organic pollutants as well as bacteria taking into considerations of operational procedures such as hydraulic loadings head retention time employed in the full scale applications in order to provide sufficient continuous safe acceptable physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use cheaper and effective water pretreatment options are necessary mbsfs can be one of the ideal pretreatment option in the short term having access to better water sources will improve the health of individuals and this in the long term might provide social welfare and benefits in the global context acknowledgments this research was supported by khalifa university and dewa dubai electric and water authority uae through the mohammed bin rashid al

wells and springs and 159 million people are using untreated surface water around the world 1 drinking water sources are being polluted by microorganisms inorganic and organic materials anthropogenic activities as well as naturally occurring metals in soil fe and mn may be the sources of heavy metals in surface waters 2 according to an analysis pardo river brazil showed metal ion concentrations for as be cd cr cu hg mn ni pb sn tl zn ranging from 0 2 to 252 38 μg l 3 according to another study cu fe pb mn cr ni are the most common metals concentrations are in the range of 0 05 3 5 mg l that can be found in surface water depending on the industrialization industrial solid waste dumping and seasonal changes 4 another study found that in rivers the concentrations of cr cu as ni pb cd ions were ranging from 8 to 83 μg l 5 in addition to metal pollution in water sources suspended and colloidal solids in water can result in microbiologically unsafe water due to hosting and leading the growth of pathogens on their surfaces 6 7 absent inadequate or inappropriate management of drinking water can cause morbidity and mortality in underdeveloped and developing countries exposure to high nickel concentration causes lung nose and bone cancers 8 even though copper is an essential micronutrient for human body it is toxic at high concentrations causing anemia incremental risk of lung cancer and stomach intestinal distress 9 zinc is also an essential element needed for body however high concentrations can lead to damages in the pancreas and it can cause anemia and decreased levels of high density lipoprotein hdl cholesterol 10 iron can lead to coronary health diseases 11 e coli and total coliforms can cause intestinal illnesses according to the who report 842 000 people including 361 000 children under 5 years old die each year from diarrhea due to unsafe drinking water consumption 1 therefore point of use systems are utmost important to bring adequate and safe drinking water for people in need the biosand filter bsf is a slow sand filter modified for household needs to treat water by dr david manz in 1990s and it has been in use around the world since then 12 15 filter design consists of gravel pea gravel and sand layers consecutively physical and biologic treatments are the main steps to treat the water in bsf water filters through sand and gravel then enters the underdrain the biological layer formed on the top of the sand breaks down organic particles and preys on microorganism andparticles are strained out by sand from water 12 16 18 bsf can remove 73 95 of fe 25 of dissolved organic carbon 90 of organic and inorganic materials 47 of ar 70 of turbidity 40 of ca 50 of mg 50 of ar 18 of no3 21 of po4 from the water 11 12 19 21 since the first bsf development the design of filter has been modified by either amending extra adsorbent media between layers or changing hydraulic head hydraulic loading pore volume size of the media depth of the filter media 22 28 the viruses bacteria protozoa turbidity total organic carbon toc chemical oxygen demand cod and some metal ions removal by modified biosand filters mbsfs amended additional adsorbent media were reported in different studies 11 29 33 iron oxide amended bsf small scale glass column removed 5log10 ms2 bacteriophage and full scale bsfs with iron particles removed 4log10 ms2 bacteriophage 34 biosand filter amended with 26 cm height of activated carbon and 36 cm height of zeolite removed 98 of ammonium 98 of pb 97 of cod and 87 of phosphate 35 vinegar amended anaerobic bsf removed 100 of ammonia and 50 of arsenic 36 iron oxide coated sand mbsf removed 99 3 of bacteria and 90 of turbidity 29 pinus bark biomass added bsf removed 93 2 and 95 3 reductions of e coli and total coliforms 37 zeolite enriched mbsf removed 80 of ca 89 of mg 99 of fe 56 of ar 54 of fl 96 of turbidity 37 of nitrates and 41 of toc 19 it was shown that mbsf enriched with melia azedarach biomass removed 97 9 99 9 of fe 31 61 of pb concentrations between 2 6 mg l and 100 of escherichia coli e coli 33 mbsf enriched with brass removed 90 11 of total coliforms 98 2 of e coli 88 5 of turbidity mbsf enriched with zero valent iron zvi removed 98 of total coliforms 98 2 of e coli and 95 of turbidity 38 39 another study employing bsf enriched with zvi removed 99 of total coliforms fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci 40 the available literature is still inadequate in order to evaluate the performance of bsf and mbsf in removing heavy metals organic and inorganic contaminants which may present in source water and directly affect the human health therefore the purpose of this study is to investigate the performance of mbsf enriched with iron oxide coated gravel iocg to remove organic matter with reference to toc cod turbidity total coliforms e coli and different concentrations of metals ni fe cu zn from source water the effects of filter media on the efficiency of filters were taken into consideration to analyze the contaminant removal mechanisms iocg was incorporated as an extra adsorbent layer to improve the removal efficiencies of metal ions based on the results of previous studies iocg in a batch study removed 99 72 of pb ii 99 61 of cu ii 99 51 of cd ii 99 3 of fe iii and 93 3 of al iii iocg in a fixed bed column removed 96 5 of cu ii 94 8 of pb ii 90 of cd ii 84 of fe iii and 67 of al iii 41 the degree of metal adsorption by iocg at ph 7 in batch reactors followed the order of cu ii 99 62 cd ii 99 61 fe ii 98 90 zn ii 90 4 ni ii 83 8 42 in addition to metal removal efficiency mbsfs were evaluated for ph dissolved oxygen do flowrate and conductivity performance as well two drinking water standards world health organization who and gulf cooperation council gcc were used to evaluate the performance of mbsfs since total coliforms e coli or thermo tolerant fecal coliforms bacteria counts are the only monitored microbial parameter by who and gcc total coliforms and e coli were chosen as two microbial parameters monitored in this study 43 44 ni fe cu and zn were chosen as the monitored metal ions due their prevalence in surface water 2 materials and methods 2 1 filter setup four laboratory scale acrylic flow cells with 3 81 cm inner diameter and 55 cm height with duplicates were prepared to construct filters the control mbsf filters were filled consecutively with gravel pea granular gravel and coarse sand for setting up the three layers of underdrain and filled with fine sand as fourth layer the mbsfs with iocg consisted of gravel iocg coarse sand and fine sand local sand was chosen as mbsf media there are three types of sand available in the united arab emirates uae white yellow and red sand all types of sand were obtained locally and sieved with a humboldt sieve shaker after the sieve analysis only red sand samples gave the required uniformity coefficient d60 d10 2 defined by centre for affordable water and sanitation technology cawst and another study uniformity coefficient for sand placed in bsf should be between 1 5 2 5 and effective size d10 should be between 0 15 to 0 3 12 45 therefore red sand was chosen as bsf media another study reported that the uae red sand is composed of 300 μm particles whereas white and yellow sand are in the range of 150 300 μm 46 characterization of iocg using scanning electron microscope sem energy dispersive x ray edx x ray diffraction xrd and brunauer emmett teller bet surface area analysis was reported and explained in our previous studies in detail 41 42 gravel was purchased from marinara transport abu dhabi and sieved with a humboldt sieve shaker sieved sand and gravel were washed and dried in an oven iocg was prepared according to a procedure explained in the previous studies 41 42 the filter were set with the following layers of media 4 cm of gravel size 12 5 mm 4 cm of pea granular gravel iocg size 2 36 mm 2 cm coarse sand size 1 18 mm and 40 cm fine sand with effective size d10 0 297 mm d60 0 6 mm based on a previous study full size structure shown in fig 1 39 the outlet tube pvc tubing with 0 5 cm inner diameter was elevated 4 cm above the top of the filter media a diffuser having holes with 2 mm of diameters was used to distribute source water evenly on the filter media and it was placed 5 cm above the top of the filter media the standing water was maintained 3 cm above the filter media during the pause period the volume of the filled column was 1 15 l sand gravel water with a void space of 0 35 l to avoid air between voids filters were filled with water before adding any media the porosity of the sand was found to be 0 26 the filters were run intermittently twice a day with 12 h pause period with 0 7 l of water for 64 days the average flow rates were 0 015 l min 0 78 m h for mbsf iocg and 0 020 l min 1 05 m h for mbsf control these values were in the prescribed range 0 16 1 1 m h 30 45 the water temperature was 24 2 c during the study 2 2 synthetic water preparation and microbiology a wastewater sample as microbial seeding solution was obtained from the second clarifier of a local wastewater treatment plant abu dhabi uae the wastewater activated sludge was transferred to a laboratory scale aeration tank and fed by a solution of synthetic wastewater this procedure is adopted from a previous study 47 1 l of tap water was seeded with 1 ml of the activated sludge and 2 mg l or 5 mg l of cu fe zn and ni as synthetic source water to study contaminant removal performance of filters cu fe zn and ni solutions were prepared using zncl2 nicl2 6h2o cuso4 5h2o feso4 7h2o supplied by fisher scientific changing the concentrations of metals in the influent samples led to changes in the turbidity level ph and specific conductance turbidity in the influent was measured to be 4 2 1 38 nephelometric turbidity unit ntu for 2 mg l of influent metal concentrations and 10 41 2 34 ntu for 5 mg l of influent metal concentrations the average value of ph of the influent water was 6 5 for 2 mg l metal concentrations and 6 94 for 5 mg l metal concentrations the average value of the conductivity of the influent was 167 97 μs cm for 2 mg l influent metal concentration and 192 6 μs cm for 5 mg l influent metal concentration organic matter removal was evaluated with reference to cod and toc different concentrations of metals in the influent did not affect the initial cod or toc concentrations cod was measured to be 70 28 57 mg l and toc was measured to be 31 66 5 83 mg l in the synthetic source water different concentrations of heavy metals did not affect the initial bacterial counts do levels and flow rate total number of the total coliforms in the influent was maintained at 15 035 8842 colony forming unit cfu 100 ml and e coli was maintained at 1850 3248 cfu 100 ml during the study the numbers of e coli and total coliforms and concentrations of metals in the water were determined before and after the filtration process 2 3 bacterial and physicochemical analysis grab samples were collected from the outlet tubes daily weekdays and tested immediately for ph conductivity and dissolved oxygen a number of different samples were tested on different intervals on a daily weekdays basis for flow rate and biweekly basis for turbidity e coli total coliforms metals toc and cod sterile containers were placed under the outlet tubes and filled with the effluent water until the filtration was complete approximately 28 30 minutes the samples were well mixed before the analyses all analyses were carried on in one hour after the collection standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 9222 d membrane filtration method was used to analyze e coli and total coliforms 48 turbidity was measured using thermo scientific eutech tn100 turbidity meter specific conductance ph and do were measured using hach hq40d portable multi meter metals were determined using atomic absorption spectrometer varian fs220 cod was determined using hach lck 314 cod vials digested in hach drb200 digital reactor and measured using hach dr6000 uv vis spectrophotometer toc was determined using hach lck 386 vials centrifuged in toc x5 shaker and measured using hach dr600 uv vis spectrophotometer with rfid technology 2 4 data analysis all measurements were run in duplicates and the arithmetic mean standard deviation and minimum and maximum values were calculated for all data sets percent removal values were calculated using the following formula influent effluent influent x100 1 log reduction was calculated in addition to percent removal for e coli and total coliforms removal the student s t test two tailed was used to determine whether or not mbsf control and mbsf iocg data are significantly different from each other for contaminant removal 2 5 regeneration study after 64 days of experimental analysis filters were emptied and filter media were washed with tap water and dried in an oven and placed back to filter columns filters ran for 50 days and fed with 5 mg l initial metal concentrations mixed with 1 ml of activated sludge as synthetic source water and when flow rate slowed down the experiments were stopped bi weekly analysis were performed for e coli total coliforms metals toc and cod to analyze second cycle of the mbsfs performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 flow rate the average flow rates were 0 015 l min for mbsf control and 0 020 l min for mbsf iocg throughout the study which were in the acceptable range stated by elliott et al 30 as previously discussed in the filter design section a decline in the flow rate over time was observed due to filter maturation fouling because of large size pathogens parasites cysts and suspended solids trapped between sand particles compression of the filter media and the increment of head loss of the system for mbsf control and mbsf iocg as shown in fig 2 33 38 39 the sequence of the average flow rates was observed as mbsf iocg mbsf control the flow rates highly depended on the sand grain distribution sand depth and quality of raw water 40 45 3 2 ph and conductivity the average ph value of the influent water having 2 mg l metal concentrations was 6 53 which slightly increased to an average of 7 3 for the mbsf control and 7 12 for the mbsf iocg effluents the average ph value of the influent water with 5 mg l metal concentrations was 6 94 and it increased to 7 48 for the mbsf control and 7 57 for mbsf iocg as listed in table 1 since both filters produced similar results in terms of ph the data related to change of ph over time was plotted only for the filters with 2 mg l influent metal concentration in fig 3 a for the filters with 2 mg l influent metal concentrations the average value of the conductivity of the influent was 167 97 μs cm and it increased to an average of 2627 μs cm for the mbsf iocg and 268 1 μs cm for the mbsf control effluents in the same way for the filters with 5 mg l influent metal concentrations the average value of the conductivity of the influent was 192 6 μs cm and it increased to an average of 263 μs cm for the mbsf iocg and 254 μs cm for the mbsf control since both filters showed similar results in terms specific conductance only the conductance versus time data for 2 mg l filters was given and plotted in fig 3b and table 1 slightly increased effluent ph values and considerable conductivity differences between influent and effluent samples pointed out that some monovalent ions k na on sand surface can react with water 37 previous studies showed that gravel surface consisted of ca 2 mg 2 and iocg surface consisted of ca 2 mg 2 fe 3 and cl ions 41 42 49 another study reported that al 3 51 mg g sand fe 5 038 mg g sand k 0 953 mg g sand mg 9 78 mg g sand ca 173 4 mg g sand na 0 396 mg g sand and ni 0 045 mg g sand are abundant in red sand in the uae washing sand samples does not remove ca and na and during the operation of filter na and ca leaching causes higher ph and conductivity values 46 in addition to ion leaching dissolution of carbonate species from the sand contributes to ph and conductivity increment in effluents 37 50 3 3 dissolved oxygen it was found that the average value of the do in the influent was 8 04 mg l average values of 7 mg l do for mbsf iocg and 6 97 mg l do for mbsf control effluents were measured as shown in fig 4 and table 1 high do values in effluents indicated that aerobic condition was dominant throughout the filter beds the sequence of do rates in filters effluents was mbsfiocg mbsf control do concentrations were almost constant and this reflects that do in influent water was consumed by the biological layer up to 1 mg l which was less than the previously reported studies 29 51 aeration during the sampling at the outlet and using lab scale filter columns might have caused higher do concentrations 39 3 4 metal removal the concentrations of metals in the influent were kept as 2 mg l and 5 mg l for each metal for the study the average effluent concentrations on mbsf iocg for 2 mg l of initial metal concentrations were observed to be 0 014 mg l for cu 0 076 mg l for zn 0 029 mg l

pores were saturated with metals in both mbsf control and mbsf iocg media the affinity of the media through cu was reported in previous studies 41 42 49 increasing dosage caused slight decrease on removal rates metal removals in mbsfs were in the order of cu zn ni fe ii implying a correlation with the metal solubility values except ni pksp cu 19 3 zn 16 5 fe ii 16 3 ni 15 2 nickel s higher removal rate than zinc could be explained by collective effects of the metal ions hydrated ionic radius hydration energies and electronegativity metals with smaller ionic radii tend to have higher hydration numbers and this in turn can lead to larger hydrated radii and inefficient adsorption hydrated radius ni 4 04 ao zn 4 3 ao cu 4 19 ao fe 4 28 ao 52 54 on the other hand as the electronegativity degree of an atom s ability to attract the electrons in a covalent bond of the metal cations increase the resulting bond between the metal cation and the oxygen atom on the mineral

similarly it was reported that mbsf with zeolite layer removed 99 of the iron with an initial 0 4 mg l iron concentration 19 the mechanism of iron removal by bsf was reported to be occurring in the biolayer zone in which iron oxidizing microorganisms such as gallionella sp biologically oxidize soluble iron ii into insoluble iron iii oxides 57 58 aeration process in the filters which was observed to have occurred during the time of the study explained above in the do section could be another reason of oxidation of soluble iron ii into insoluble iron iii 19 59 since sand and gravel showed remarkable potentials to remove heavy metals in many studies metal removals by mbsf can be explained by used filter media a study showed that sand column was able to remove 71 87 of the varying concentrations of zn 25 100 ppm in the solution 60 it was shown that silty sand in column analysis revealed an adsorption capacity order as zn cu ni 61 sand filter showed 99 6 of cu removal due to adsorption entanglement of heavy metals by organic matters organic ligands at the top layer simple adsorption to organic matter and sand in the middle layer and chemical adsorption to the sand surface

at initial ph 7 and final ph 8 5 81 in addition rinsed microgabbro gravel removed 90 of zn 64 the major mechanisms for metal removal in mbsf were protonation de protonation of sand ion exchange adsorption onto sand gravel settlement binding of the metals to the biofilm and microbial uptake 46 62 65 the process of ion exchange occurred in the pores of sand gravel having localized charged groups the dissolved ionic species causes the displacement of anions or cations which are electrostatically bound to charged groups on the surface while maintaining the charge balance the following metal ions and counter anions ca2 mg2 h k nh4 al 3 so4 2 cl no3 on the sand and gravel were displaced by heavy metals 40 49 66 67 the major contributor to the adsorption process for the metal ions was found to be the surface hydroxyl groups in silica the edge hydroxyl groups and the oxygen atoms attached to tetrahedral silicon atoms interact with heavy metals through lewis acid base interaction and the chemisorption of metal ions are facilitated furthermore adsorption process accelerates for metal cations as a result of higher hydrolysis rates smaller ionic size high polarizability and high charge density 63 66 varying ph of solution played a significant role to remove metal ions by precipitation it is known that zn presents as zn2 in solution up to ph 8 8 68 69 cu2 is the dominant species at low ph values up to ph 5 8 beyond ph 5 8 copper ii hydroxide cu oh 2 is the dominant species up to ph 12 3 4 68 the solubility of ni ii decreases significantly beyond ph 9 0 70 in alkaline solutions fe ii ions form fe oh 2 s precipitate 41 42 it is necessary to conduct further studies to elaborate the possible mechanism s involved in the removal of metal ions through bsf it was observed that adding iocg to mbsf setup did not improve metal removal efficiency placing an extra adsorbent layer at the lower parts of the filter may not be effective because all possible removal mechanisms might have already taken place as the source water reached the lower parts of the filter 3 5 turbidity removal influents and effluents from each filter were compared for turbidity the average influent turbidity was 4 2 1 38 ntu for 2 mg l inlet metal concentrations a 92 66 reduction with an average of 0 33 ntu effluent turbidity for mbsf control and a 90 5 reduction with an average of 0 35 ntu effluent turbidity for mbsf iocg were observed the average influent turbidity was 10 41 2 34 ntu for 5 mg l inlet metal concentrations a 96 37 reduction with an average of 0 37 ntu effluent turbidity for mbsf control and a 95 84 reduction with an average of 0 41 ntu effluent turbidity for mbsf iocg were observed as shown in fig 6 and as explained in table 2 turbidity was caused by suspended and insoluble species which were removed by both filters efficiently to the approximately same level regardless of the initial turbidity concentrations the main mechanism of turbidity removal by mbsfs was surface straining by sand particles as well as other processes such as interception sedimentation and adsorption on bio layer 19 71 the two tailed t test was not statistically significant at the 0 05 level between mbsf control and mbsf iocg p 0 38 0 18 for 2 mg l and 5 mg l respectively the sequence of turbidity removal was observed as mbsf control mbsf iocg it was reported in other studies that bsf and mbsfs removed 70 98 of turbidity 11 29 30 38 40 45 all turbidity levels from all filters were below who and gcc drinking water quality standards 5 ntu and 4 ntu respectively 43 72 3 6 cod and toc removal initial cod concentrations were 70 mg l for each filter an average of 49 3 of cod removal with 33 87 mg l of effluent cod concentration was observed for the mbsf iocg an average of 46 34 of cod removal with 35 8 mg l effluent cod concertation was observed for the mbsf control as shown in fig 7 a and table 2 the two tailed t test at the 0 05 level was not significant between mbsf control and mbsf iocg p 0 18 both filters produced higher removal rates after 20 days of filter operation cod removal rates were in parallel with the other studies sand filters with 0 65 m and 0 35 m depth removed 45 and 44 of cod respectively 73 in the same fashion another study showed 46 6 of cod reduction by modified sand filter 74 lower cod removal rates by sand filters can be explained on the basis of the media used water characteristics hydraulic loads and ph of solution according to some studies high hydraulic rates and different ph values might result in lower cod removal rates 75 77 initial toc concentrations were 31 66 mg l for each filter an average of 16 38 mg l effluent toc concentration with 49 65 removal efficiency was observed for the mbsf iocg an average of 16 39 mg l effluent toc concentration with 48 36 removal efficiency was observed for the mbsf control as shown in fig 7b and table 2 the two tailed t test at the 0 05 level was not significant between mbsf control and mbsf iocg p 0 98 similar to cod removal efficiencies both filters produced higher removal rates after 20 days of operation and this indicated that the biological layer formed at the top of filter started to consume more carbonaceous material from source water likewise another study using bsf enriched with zeolites showed 41 of toc removal rate 19 although the safety limits for cod and toc for drinking water were not defined in who or gcc drinking water standards united states environmental protection agency usepa set the toc limit for treated water prior to chlorination less than 2 0 mg l 78 therefore more studies should focus on organic material removal by mbsfs the cod and toc reduction order was observed to be mbsf iocg mbsf control 3 7 total coliforms and e coli removals the reduction of total coliforms averaged log 0 33 49 75 for mbsf control and log 0 42 60 98 for mbsf iocg from day 0 to day 20 the two tailed t test at the 0 05 level was not significant between mbsf control and mbsf iocg p 0 24 the biological layer maturation period took 20 days which was similar to the ones that were found in other studies 39 38 23 from day 20 onward an average of log 2 07 94 21 reduction for mbsf control and log 2 23 95 33 reduction for mbsf iocg were observed as shown in fig 8 a and table 2 the two tailed t test at the 0 05 level was not statistically significant between mbsf control and mbsf iocg p 0 073 the removal performance increased over the time the range of the total coliforms removal efficiencies for the filters was in parallel with the other studies performed for bsf and mbsf with a range from 90 to 99 29 30 38 40 45 e coli reductions averaged log 1 52 94 2 for the mbsf control log 1 61 95 43 for the mbsf iocg from day 0 until day 20 the two tailed t test was not statistically significant at the 0 05 level between mbsf control and mbsf iocg p 0 206 e coli removal order of percentages for the filters during the biological layer maturation period were observed as mbsf iocg mbsf control the average e coli removal percentages from day 20 onward were observed as log 2 04 98 07 reduction for mbsf control and log 2 2 99 reduction for mbsf iocg as shown in fig 8b and table 2 the two tailed t test at the 0 05 level was not significant between mbsf control and mbsf iocg p 0 21 after ripening period the sequence of e coli reduction was observed as mbsf iocg mbsf control the range of the e coli removal efficiencies for filters in this study was in parallel with other studies performed for bsf and mbsf iron filters with a range of 93 99 29 30 38 79 80 throughout the experiments mbsfs accomplished 99 microbial reduction after biological layer maturation period the sequence of total coliforms and e coli reduction was observed as mbsf iocg mbsf control the removal performance of e coli and total coliforms increased with the time suggesting maturation of biofilm all filters produced slightly lower removal performances after 60 days adsorption straining by sand natural die off and predation are the principal mechanism to remove microorganisms from source water although mbsfs reached 99 removal rates the numbers of e coli and total coliforms in the effluent were exceeding who and gcc drinking water standards according to who and gcc standards bacteria counts should be zero in a 100 ml sample 43 44 mbsf iocg produced slightly higher percent removalof e coli and total coliforms than mbsf control removal in the mbsf iocg was achieved primarily due to both the germicidal effect of iron coating on gravel and the biofilm formation 40 3 8 regeneration results the analysis of the regeneration studies showed that in the second cycle after the regeneration of filters filters still provided higher removal rates as shown in fig 9 the average removals with mbsf iocg after the regeneration were observed to be cu 98 53 zn 96 82 ni 92 26 fe ii 91 2 turbidity 91 76 cod 50 toc 43 65 the average removal rates in the descending order with the mbsf control after the regeneration were observed to be cu 98 55 zn 96 32 ni 90 38 fe ii 90 83 turbidity 91 63 cod 49 0 toc 43 67 4 conclusion the filters were operated intermittently for 64 days and the physicochemical and biological tests were conducted to compare the performances of the mbsfs for organic matter bacteria and different metal concentrations taking into account the filter media a decline in the flow rate over the time was observed due to the biological layer maturation and fouling in both types of filters the turbidity in the effluent water for both filters was below who and gcc drinking water standards slightly increased effluent ph and considerable differences of the influent and effluent conductivity indicated that the sand particles contain some monovalent ions as well carbonates the removal performance of e coli total coliforms cod and toc increased with the time suggesting biofilm maturation and consumption of bacteria and carbonaceous material by the biofilm increasing initial metal concentrations from 2 mg l to 5 mg l slightly decreased the filters removal capacity metal removals in mbsfs were in the order of cu zn ni fe ii the effluent metal concentrations were below who and gcc drinking water permissible limits in both filters for both concentrations the major mechanisms for the metal removal in the mbsfs were protonation deprotonation of the sand ion exchange adsorption to sand gravel settlement binding of the metals to the biofilm and microbial uptake in this respect this study highlighted the probable removal mechanism in the mbsf through analyzing every filter layers function for the contaminant removal although addition of iocg did not make any significant improvement in terms of reduction of turbidity metals cod toc e coli and total coliforms mbsf iocg achieved better cod toc e coli total coliforms cu and ni removal percentages placing an extra adsorbent layer at the lower parts of the filter was found to be not effective in terms of the removal performance this can be attributed to the fact that all possible adsorption processes might have occurred and removed the contaminants till the moment the source water reached the lower part of the filter after the regeneration of the filters on the second cycle of the study the removal efficiencies were observed to be still high this study showed that with the help of mbsfs metal and turbidity levels could be reduced to the permissible drinking water levels however mbsfs did not reduce cod toc and bacteria to the permissible levels although this study was a lab scale mbsf removal rates of bacteria and turbidiy were similar to the full scale mbsf a previous study therefore future studies can be directed to improve the efficiency of mbsf to eliminate organic pollutants as well as bacteria taking into considerations of operational procedures such as hydraulic loadings head retention time employed in the full scale applications in order to provide sufficient continuous safe acceptable physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use cheaper and effective water pretreatment options are necessary mbsfs can be one of the ideal pretreatment option in the short term having access to better water sources will improve the health of individuals and this in the long term might provide social welfare and benefits in the global context acknowledgments this research was supported by khalifa university and dewa dubai electric and water authority uae through the mohammed bin rashid al
