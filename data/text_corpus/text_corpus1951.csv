9755,eighteen global circulation models gcms were evaluated to determine the potential impacts of future climate change on irrigated and rainfed maize yields using the fao aquacrop model on an inter annual and decadal basis 2020 s until 2090 s prior to deemed fit for future simulations aquacrop model was subject to comprehensive calibration and validation using extensive field measured long term datasets we observed declines in decadal rainfed maize yields ranging from 2 2 0 2 t ha to 17 1 4 t ha and from 8 1 0 6 t ha to 21 5 1 7 t ha under representative concentration pathways rcps rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively the range of declines was lower for irrigated yields 3 7 0 5 t ha to 6 7 1 0 t ha and 4 3 0 6 t ha to 15 6 2 2 t ha under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively near maximal yield declines were distributed uniformly across the century and almost all decades exhibited 10 yield declines under at least one emission scenario both economic grain yield advantage associated with irrigation difference in irrigated and rainfed yields and yield stabilizing benefit of irrigation difference in rainfed and irrigated yield variability are projected to decrease significantly p 0 05 under rcp 8 5 rainfed maize yield variability was 533 and 200 greater than irrigated yield variability under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively for rcp 4 5 the long term mean inter gcm 2020 2099 standard deviation in rainfed yields 4 6 t ha was 460 greater than that in irrigated yields 0 8 t ha while for rcp 8 5 this difference was 271 4 6 t ha vs 1 2 t ha tmax and tmin were able to explain more variability in irrigated than rainfed maize yields the difference being 229 and 126 respectively precipitation change explained 46 and 50 of the variability in rainfed yield change under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively and was 100 and 733 greater than what was explained for irrigated yield variability the research findings hold significance for water allocation considering how dynamics of grain yields vs availability of irrigation may manifest in the future keywords aquacrop climate impacts rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 global circulation models 1 introduction global climate is very likely to warm by 1 2 1 9 c in the near term 2021 2040 ipcc 2021 the global mean surface temperature was 0 99 c higher during 2001 2020 than during the pre industrial period of 1850 1900 ipcc 2021 climate change has already impacted crop productivity of major agricultural crops across global agro ecosystems lobell et al 2011 kukal and irmak 2018a 2012 lobell and asner 2003 leng 2017 ray et al 2015 2019 these changes in climate characteristics are projected to manifest as increased mean air temperatures in most land and ocean regions hot extremes heavy precipitation and increased probability of drought and precipitation deficits such climate shocks and shifts will impact crop yield cultivation area and food supply thereby having major implications on sustainable agricultural development and poverty eradication goals climatic variability has been reported to explain more than 60 of the maize rice wheat and soybean yield variations in the global primary breadbasket areas ray et al 2015 thus assessment of the impacts of magnitude and variations in historical and future climate on crop yield is critical to ensuring food security for rapidly growing world population the intensity and direction of climate change impacts on crop production are complex uncertain and may result in net positive or negative outcomes the reductions in crop yields as a result of climate change are reported to be more common than crop yield benefits porter et al 2014 crop production is negatively affected by climate change due to increase in climate extremes that include changes in rainfall extremes increases in hot nights extremely high daytime temperatures drought events heat stress flooding chilling damage spread of pests and diseases studies have reported that maize and wheat yields start declining with 1 2 c of local warming and under nitrogen stress conditions at low latitude areas porter et al 2014 overall a significant reduction in crop yield of four major commodity crops including wheat by 6 rice by 3 2 maize by 7 4 and soybean by 3 1 has been projected for each degree celsius rise in global mean temperature zhao et al 2017 on the other hand warming may benefit crop production in higher latitude areas with more fertile soils favoring crops and grassland production in contrast to the areas at low latitudes climate variations have also been reported to cause lengthening of the growing season due to earlier start and later end of the growing season qian et al 2010 skaggs and irmak 2012 while some reports indicate that increase in atmospheric co2 concentrations increased yields by improving radiation and water use efficiencies the effects of co2 fertilization on crops are still uncertain and vary within c3 and c4 crop species this implies that the climate change impacts cannot be generalized as they vary with crop type and site thus it is very important to conduct crop and site specific impact assessments while carrying out future projections to better understand potential dynamics between climate change and agricultural productivity this research was conducted to quantify and analyze the impacts of climate variability on south central nebraska maize productivity maize is the largest crop grown in the u s a accounting for approximately 31 3 of the world maize production usda fas 2020 nebraska is ranked as the third state contributing the most to the total u s maize production 13 0 environmental conditions in nebraska and the high plains region is highly variable as indicated by recent droughts 1983 2002 2005 2012 2017 heat waves 2000 2002 2006 2010 2011 and floods 2001 2007 2008 2011 2019 changes in the observed frequency and intensity of extreme weather events are major concerns for agriculture and will most likely negatively impact agricultural productivity in the u s great plains states and around the world the warming of 1 5 oc has been reported for the global scale in the last century ipcc 2021 and as many other regions nebraska has experienced warming since the beginning of 20th century mostly during winter and spring months irmak et al 2012 2018 kukal and irmak 2017 the length of frost free season has increased by 5 25 days across nebraska and is projected to increase in future decades skaggs and irmak et al 2012 kukal and irmak 2018b the percentage of average annual precipitation in the form of heavy rainfall events has increased for portions of northern great plains states including eastern nebraska and the midwest and this trend is projected to continue in future decades increasing the flood magnitudes irmak et al 2012 irmak 2018 climate change impacts many agricultural practices including hydrologic variables precipitation runoff deep percolation etc crop irrigation requirements evapotranspiration etc irrigation is one of the major reasons for consistent and high yields of maize in nebraska and other great plains states nebraska has higher irrigated acres under maize than any other u s state and state s crop production is highly dependent on surface and groundwater resources and precipitation both of which are subject to consequences from climate change and variability thus identifying the climate change impacts under both rainfed and irrigated maize production is crucial to assess and quantify changes in maize yield for future policy and decision making and developing best agricultural production and management practices and adoption to such changes the complex and multi way interactions among climatic elements and crop parameters require a multifaceted mechanistic and comprehensive assessments process based crop simulation models are valuable tools to evaluate crop response to climate variations the fao aquacrop model was developed to predict attainable crop growth water use and yield parameters for various crops under water limiting conditions aquacrop model was chosen to study the impact of climate changes on maize yield because 1 it has been calibrated and validated for the study region sandhu and irmak 2019b 2 it performs well for simulating maize crop s responses under a wide array of environmental conditions and nutrient management scenarios dale et al 2017 foster et al 2017 heng et al 2009 abedinpour et al 2012 hsiao et al 2009 ahmadi et al 2015 and 3 it has been used in crop impact projection studies globally and is often intended for policy outcomes bouras et al 2019 stevens and madani 2016 dale et al 2017 the detailed theoretical background and concepts of aquacrop are provided by steduto et al 2009 and raes et al 2009 the particular features that distinguishes aquacrop from other crop models include 1 its focus solely on water 2 the use of canopy cover cc for simulating crop growth and development and water use instead of leaf area index as cc is more readily available and known to users other than researchers 3 the use of water productivity that allows extended application of model to diverse climates locations and seasons 4 the relatively low number of input parameters and most of which are explicit and mostly intuitive as compared with other models 5 a well developed user interface and availability of open source code with appropriate documentation and 6 its considerable balance between accuracy simplicity and robustness therefore aquacrop model was selected for this study to determine and evaluate long term future and past irrigated and rainfed maize productivity relationships with climate irrigation is often discussed as a mitigation tool for decoupling of crop production and climate variability impacts although the role of irrigation on historical crop yields is adequately addressed kukal and irmak 2019 2020 troy et al 2015 li and troy 2018 limited knowledge exists on how these benefits will sustain in the future especially with respect to rainfed crop production it is critical to understand the evolution of crop yield tradeoffs that result from conversion of irrigated to rainfed cropland due to lack of freshwater resources limited knowledge exists on how climate change and variability will impact maize yield in the most intensely irrigated conditions of the u s this is especially critical to quantify to be able to better analyze project and plan groundwater depletion vs agricultural water requirements and crop productivity relationships with the potential groundwater resources limitations in the future the region may experience conversion of irrigated to rainfed farmland deines et al 2020 in this context it is important to develop irrigated and rainfed yield projections under different emission scenarios to help understand the economic tradeoff among more stable and higher yields and irrigation capital which currently constitute significant knowledge gaps the objective of this study is to assess the impacts of climate parameters projected by 18 gcms during the remainder of the 21st century 2020 2099 on irrigated and rainfed maize yields under two different emission scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 ultimately the relative performance of irrigated maize is evaluated against that of rainfed maize to project the sensitivity of the two different crop management regimes against climate change and variability 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area maize accounts for 9 81 million acres and 92 million acres of land use in nebraska and the u s respectively usda nass 2020 and thus was selected for this research due to its regional and national importance the research was conducted in the irmak research laboratory for soil and climatic conditions of south central agricultural laboratory at the university of nebraska lincoln 40 34 n and 98 8 w at an elevation of 552 m above mean sea level near clay center nebraska the study site is considered to be representative of agricultural management practices in the region and represents the most densely irrigated region in the central plains of the u s the research site lies at the transition zone between dry sub humid and semi arid climate zones with the long term 1980 2010 mean annual precipitation of 731 mm average annual temperature of 10 3 c and average annual snowfall of 381 mm the site is also characterized by significant annual and growing season variability of precipitation in both magnitude and timing the soil at the site is a hastings silt loam with field capacity of 0 34 m3 m 3 permanent wilting point of 0 14 m3 m 3 saturation point of 0 53 m3 m 3 and saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of 430 mm day 1 irmak 2010 maize is usually planted in late april to mid may period and usually harvested in october the most common cropping system is maize soybean rotation with increasing land area under continuous maize irmak 2015a maize is irrigated using groundwater resources primarily pumped from ogallala aquifer and surface water resources primarily in the western portion of the state the center pivot is the primary 80 85 irrigation method used with approximately 15 20 gravity furrow irrigation and with slow increase in subsurface drip irrigation land area irmak 2010 2015a 2 2 historical and projected climate data description and pre processing historical climate data 1983 2019 for the site was obtained from an automated weather data station courtesy of high plains regional climate center hprcc this period was considered as the baseline scenario against which all future projected variables were compared in this research daily climate data for the baseline period included precipitation mm maximum and minimum air temperatures c relative humidity solar radiation mj m 2 day 1 and wind speed m s 1 daily standardized grass reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated in aquacrop model using the asce standardized penman monteith equation asce ewri 2005 for climate change projections downscaled output from 18 general circulation models gcm s participating in the fifth coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 were used to extract climate data for future aquacrop simulations table 1 lists the names country and agency of development for each of the 18 models used the downscaled output for air temperatures at 2 m height incoming shortwave solar radiation wind speed at 10 m height specific humidity at 2 m height and precipitation were obtained for a 1 16 degree approx 6 km grid cell around the study site the data was obtained for two representative concentration pathways rcps 4 5 and 8 5 for 2020 2099 the rcp 4 5 scenario is a stabilization scenario implying that radiative forcing level stabilizes at 4 5 wm 2 prior to 2100 due to adoption of a range of technologies and strategies for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions in the rcp 8 5 emissions scenario the radiative forcing level reaches 8 5 wm 2 due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions as represented in the literature leading to high greenhouse gas concentration levels bias correction and statistical downscaling of all the climate variables obtained from each model were performed using the multivariate adaptive constructed analogs approach maca version 2 abatzoglou and brown 2012 maca is a statistical approach to downscale gcm outputs from their original coarser spatial resolution to a higher resolution and the bias corrected downscaled gcm data is available at http maca northwestknowledge net the maca datasets offer two contiguous us wide products that use 20 cmip5 gcms and vary by the training data used we obtained the datasets that used 6 km 1 16th degree daily product of livneh et al 2015 two variables that were obtained from the maca dataset had to be processed before use in aquacrop model simulations firstly wind speed at 10 m height was converted to wind speed at 2 m height using logarithmic wind speed profile relationships outlined in the asce ewri 2005 1 u 2 u z 4 87 ln 67 8 z 5 42 where u2 is wind speed at 2 m above ground surface m s 1 uz is wind speed at z m above ground surface m s 1 and z is height of measurement above ground surface m in this research z was 10 m as obtained from maca dataset also specific humidity sh was converted to relative humidity rh using the following equation xxx relationship 2 rh 100 sh ρ e s 0 622 where sh is in kg kg 1 obtained from maca and ρ is the atmospheric pressure corrected for elevation kpa which is estimated by 3 ρ ρ sea level 293 0 0065 elevation 5 26 293 where ρ sea level is the pressure at sea level 101 3 kpa and elevation is the elevation m above sea level 552 m for the study site finally the data was manipulated from raw maca obtained files in formats appropriate for aquacrop input files following standard practice the aquacrop simulations were carried out independently using climate data from each of the 18 gcm s and then representing final results using an ensemble mean of 18 aquacrop derived variables the same 18 gcms have been successfully used by ficklin and novick 2017 to investigate atmospheric drying across the conus during 2065 2099 in addition to assessing the crop yield for each year from 2020 to 2099 future decadal time slices representing 2020s 2030s 2040s 2050s 2060s 2070s 2080s and 2090s were chosen to obtain quantitative estimates of climate change impacts on maize production the atmospheric co2 concentrations were obtained from the mauna loa observatory for the baseline period and from rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios for the future period that were available in the aquacrop database 2 3 aquacrop model the climate change impacts and scenarios in this study were evaluated using aquacrop model aquacrop is a user friendly and practitioner oriented type of model which consists of four sub models 1 the atmosphere sub model consisting of rainfall reference evapotranspiration and co2 concentration 2 crop sub model involving crop growth development senescence and yield 3 management sub model including irrigation and field management practices 4 soil sub model handling soil water balance with a daily timestep the model simulates successively the four major processes of crop production including crop development transpiration tr above ground biomass production and finally yield formation the model is considered to be relatively simple yet very robust in simulating different plant growth and development processes the model has been widely used for climate change studies to simulate the effects of increased temperatures and co2 fertilization muluneh et al 2015 shrestha and shrestha 2016 vanuytrecht et al 2011 detailed model concepts principles and assumptions are discussed by steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2009 and hsiao et al 2009 the model has been calibrated for the study region by sandhu and irmak 2019a using extensive and long term field measured datasets from irmak 2015a and the calibration procedure was performed using the guidelines outlined in the aquacrop reference manual and anon 2012 the default and calibrated parameters variables are presented in table 2 comprehensive evaluation of model was conducted by sandhu and irmak 2019a by calibrating and validating the model using a wide range of field observed datasets in addition to adjusting other parameters of the model water productivity and transpiration crop coefficients were adjusted for the study site as well to calibrate biomass and yield the calibrated model indicated good agreement between simulated and field measured canopy cover r2 0 86 ef 0 83 and nrmse 7 3 soil water content in the root zone r2 0 88 ef 0 61 and nrmse 5 2 crop evapotranspiration r2 0 97 ef 0 80 and nrmse 3 2 and final grain yield r2 0 99 ef 0 80 and nrmse 7 7 in the current study the water productivity parameter was continuously adjusted in the aquacrop model based on the selected rcp scenarios such as rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 available in the model database this resulted in adjusting water productivity as a function of given atmospheric co2 concentration for that year therefore impacts of climate change were assessed using the guidelines specified in aquacrop manual aquacrop manual states that the simulations of future crop yields should consider the increase of the atmospheric co2 concentration the increase in co2 which induces co2 fertilization reduces slightly the crop transpiration tr and increases strongly the biomass water productivity wp the effect of the decrease in crop transpiration for elevated co2 concentration is considered by multiplying the crop transpiration coefficient kctr x with an adjustment factor fco2 tr 1 when running a simulation with a co2 different from the reference value i e 369 41 ppm for the year 2000 wp is adjusted with a correction factor fco2 1 for co2 369 1 ppm as of 2011 there has been an update in the aquacrop model that allows the model to treat c3 and c4 crops differently as the positive co2 effect on c4 crops is mainly confined to decreased crop transpiration vanuytrecht et al 2011 2 4 model input and management parameters input data for aquacrop model consist of both conservative and less conservative parameters the values of conservative parameters can be set as default while the less conservative parameters need to be adjusted based on crop cultivar site and management conditions the model parameters used in his study were obtained from multiple sources including field measurements local experience and literature sandhu and irmak 2019b calibrated and validated the aquacrop model for nebraska using extensive field measured datasets and established a set of model parameters for the study site these calibrated parameters were used to perform simulations of climate impacts in this study most of the non conservative parameters including plating density planting depth maximum root depth etc were obtained from irmak 2015a and are considered as representative of the agronomic practices followed in nebraska the simulations were performed using fixed planting date of may 1 which is the most representative planting date in nebraska this value was reached after careful planting date analysis of maize in nebraska based on united states department of agriculture usda statistics usda nass 2019 the procedure involved selecting the week when more than 50 of the maize was planted and the mid of the selected week was adopted as the most common planting date the conservative parameters used in the model were those compiled by sandhu and irmak 2019a b for the study area the adaptation measure tested in this study was irrigation management precipitation amounts and timings vary during each growing season that necessitates supplemental irrigation in the region irrigated maize yields and crop water use efficiencies have been reported to be greater than rainfed fields irmak 2015b evaluated maize irrigation strategies for nebraska and reported that six year average grain yields and crop water use efficiencies ranged from 9 10 to 15 32 mg ha and 1 73 2 34 kg m3 under rainfed and full irrigation treatments respectively therefore irrigation is considered as valuable adaptation strategy to increase agricultural productivity in the era of climate change consequently simulations were performed using net irrigation water requirement option available in aquacrop it calculates the total amount of water required by crop to avoid stress but does not take into account the efficiency of irrigation system specific irrigation schedules and irrigation method the model supplements small amounts of irrigation water to maintain soil moisture between field capacity and pre defined level of depletion of readily available water raw in the root zone although this option does not reflect actual field conditions and irrigation schedules followed by growers it is a valuable method for assessment of irrigation demands for climate change scenarios in this study irrigation treatment was automatically applied by the model when pre defined raw was depleted that was the threshold below which stomatal closure stress begins in the crop this irrigation scenario was defined as full irrigation treatment considering the fact that plants do not suffer any drought stress and soil water is restored to near field capacity approximately 90 of field capacity in each irrigation at the start of growing season the soil profile is replenished by pre season snowfall and rainfall events thus the initial soil water content is considered to be at field capacity the simulations for both baseline period and future scenarios were initialized at field capacity in each growing season 2 5 baseline and future yield comparisons for each emission scenario including rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 long term maize yield from 2020 to 2099 was forecasted using aquacrop model under both irrigated and rainfed settings using climate projections from all 18 gcms subsequently the final average maize yield was calculated for baseline period 1983 2019 and future climate the variation of yield among 18 gcms was calculated using standard deviation from the mean and was presented as a spread area in the graphs the averaged values of yield for the future period under both emission scenarios were compared to the corresponding values of the baseline period yield forecasts were also evaluated using decadal time slices ranging from 2020 s to 2090 s and the observed standard deviation in each decade was also presented the effects of climate change and management scenarios on grain yield were presented as percent relative change from the baseline period 3 results and discussion 3 1 historical climate characteristics 1983 2019 the average historical climatic parameters including precipitation maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin and average temperature tavg over the period of 1983 2019 are presented in fig 1a for the historical period tavg varied from 3 9 23 9 c tmin from 10 2 17 4 c and tmax from 2 3 to 30 5 c with lowest temperatures occurring in january and the highest in july overall the higher temperatures were recorded for the months of june july and august the highest precipitation amounts greater than 53 mm were mostly concentrated in summer months starting from april to october thus coinciding with the maize growing season the precipitation regime at the site is quite favorable for maize growth due to high precipitation occurring at the start of growing season with average amounts of 55 mm in april and 112 mm in may moreover snow events during winter months provide ample snow water equivalent in spring resulting in near field capacity soil conditions at crop planting this soil water storage from dormant season precipitation is sufficient to sustain crop through may without supplemental irrigation the water deficits in conjunction with non optimal seasonal distribution and timing of precipitation coincide with the most water sensitive physiological stages of maize requiring irrigation applications 3 2 projections of future 2020 2099 climate characteristics under emission scenarios the changes in future climatic conditions vs historical conditions for precipitation and temperature are represented in fig 1b and 1c in terms of difference between long term 2020 2099 mean forecasted values under both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively the ensemble mean projections of all 18 gcms indicate that the monthly minimum maximum and average temperatures tmin tmax tavg are projected to rise under both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios in comparison to the baseline period indicating a stronger warming trend in rcp 8 5 relative to rcp 4 5 as anticipated significant warming was projected for the entire maize growing season under rcp 4 5 and the entire calendar year under rcp 8 5 with the exception of slight warming in march this holds significance for temperature impacts on all maize physiological stages as well resource use dynamics the highest tavg increase will be observed in the month of august 3 6 c for rcp 4 5 and 5 1 c for rcp 8 5 which is critical for crop productivity as this period coincides with reproductive phase grain filling for example of maize on an average monthly tmin tmax and tavg ranged from 8 1 20 1 c 3 8 34 4 c and 2 2 27 3 c under rcp 4 5 and from 6 9 21 5 c 5 1 35 8 c and 0 9 28 7 c under rcp 8 5 respectively during the year on the other hand the future mean monthly precipitation is projected to range from 17 mm to 117 mm under both scenarios with highest precipitation amounts in may and lowest in january under both scenarios increased precipitation is projected for the months of november to may which mostly marks the dormant season in the region outside of this dormant window however the projected precipitation amounts are higher for july and september but lower for june august and october these inconsistent monthly projections mean that precipitation deficits or surpluses can occur at various maize growth stages the precipitation deficits projected for august for example in conjunction with warmer air temperatures may result in higher heat stress drought conditions and higher irrigation water demand during grain fill on the other hand the dormant season precipitation surplus projected for the region implies increased soil water availability for early season maize growth and lower pressure on irrigation water resources however this could also mean undesirably high soil moisture that hinders timely planting operations resulting in greater risk of exposure to frost events and shorter growing seasons among all the possible mechanisms of climate impacts on maize yields some will exacerbate or counteract others and dictate whether crop yields will be benefitted or impaired further the changes in average maize growing season may september air temperatures and precipitation were evaluated on a decadal basis in time slices of 2020s 2030s 2040s 2050s 2060s 2070s 2080s and 2090s the differences between average growing seasonal baseline 1983 2019 and decadal time slice conditions were presented in fig 2 the forecasted climate projections on decadal basis indicate rise in growing season temperatures for each consequent decade under both scenarios higher for rcp 8 5 than rcp 4 5 implying that maize will be exposed to warmer conditions in each of the succeeding decade the increase in decadal tmin tmax and tavg growing season temperatures relative to baseline period will range from 1 5 to 3 2 c 2 1 4 1 c and 1 8 3 7 c under rcp 4 5 and 1 7 6 3 c 2 4 7 4 c and 2 1 6 9 c under rcp 8 5 respectively the difference among rcp 8 5 than rcp 4 5 projected temperatures will widen for each succeeding decade this widening was observed for tmax and tavg in every succeeding decade except 2030 s while tmin showed no exceptions similarly total amount of growing season precipitation is projected to increase for all decades except for 2040s and 2090s in rcp 8 5 scenarios relative to the baseline period overall increase in seasonal precipitation amounts compared to baseline period ranged from 4 7 to 35 2 mm in rcp 4 5 and from 1 5 42 7 mm in rcp 8 5 scenario decadal analysis indicated no consistent trend between rcps 4 5 and 8 5 for predicting seasonal precipitation such that rcp 8 5 exhibited higher seasonal amounts only in 2030 s and 2050 s and rcp 4 5 exhibited higher precipitation in the rest of the decades the dominant increasing trend in growing season precipitation could affect maize in two contrasting ways it could either alleviate crop water stress by improving effective moisture available in the soil profile and thus relieving pressure on irrigation water resources the higher air temperatures and changes in other meteorological variables impacts on crop water demand will have to be weighed against additional water availability to determine net impacts on maize irrigation water demand cook et al 2015 concluded from a diversity of gcms and metrics that us central plains will see a drying response to warming drought conditions in the latter half of the 21st century which is unprecedented in the last millennium the increased precipitation can prove useful to alleviate effects of heat waves especially in rainfed maize which could become more dominant as water limitations for irrigation exacerbate alternatively if the distribution of the increased precipitation is not uniform and is characterized by extreme nature it could instead negatively harm maize yields by creating anaerobic conditions and lodging it has been recently shown that only rare hourly rainfall extremes 50 mm hr 1 are detrimental to us maize yields while they benefit from heavy rainfall up to 20 mm hr 1 lesk et al 2020 lesk et al 2020 also projected that future rainfall intensification will slightly offset yield declines from excessive heat and results in a net benefit of 1 3 3 3 irrigated and rainfed maize yield under baseline conditions the historical maize yields for clay county ne were obtained from united states department of agriculture s national agriculture statistics service usda nass individually for rainfed and irrigated conditions the rainfed maize yield varied from 2 1 to 9 7 t ha 1 with high fluctuations across the years the irrigated yields ranged from 6 8 to 13 6 t ha 1 with significantly lower fluctuations across years than its rainfed counterpart on the other hand the aquacrop simulated maize yield were in range of 0 14 8 t ha 1 for rainfed and 12 4 15 6 for irrigated conditions the comparisons of the standardized divided by their averages nass historical 1983 2018 and model simulated maize yields indicate that while the fluctuations in clay county maize yield caused by water stress are accurately captured fig 3a and b the magnitudes of the simulated yields are mostly greater than nass yields for rainfed conditions and always greater for irrigated conditions simulated maize yields showed 97 greater variability measured by coefficient of variation cv than nass rainfed yields and 70 lower variability than nass irrigated yields this is expected as nass yield data are representative of diversified producer fields with respect to crop and soil characteristics and management variety selection irrigation management etc moreover higher weed pressure fertility stresses and salinity stresses may exist in some fields in the county thereby reducing nass maize yields the study site however is a maximum productivity research environment with optimal crop and soil management finally nass yields represent fields that vary in their planting dates each year owing to planting conditions while the simulated yields were obtained assuming a fixed planting date of may 1 these inconsistencies will not significantly compromise the model predictions at regional scale as more weight is given to the interannual variability in yield rather than the absolute numbers nass yields also show a clear increasing trend over the historical period as it accounts for the advances in technology and management that producers have adopted in the state which aquacrop and other crop models cannot account for and thus do not demonstrate increased yield trends in time due to these reasons nass data cannot be fairly compared to model yield simulations instead these model simulations have been validated for the site by sandhu and irmak 2019a during 2005 2010 who found that the aquacrop model simulated maize yield agreed with observed values with maximum normalized root mean square error nrmse of 12 1 and model efficiency coefficient ef of 0 7 for the given site thus aquacrop model can serve as a useful tool to forecast predict impacts of climate change variables on maize production the aquacrop model has been found to be a valuable tool to successfully assess the response of major crops including maize wheat barley and soybean to climate change scenarios in the past yang et al 2017 rashid et al 2019 dubey and sharma 2018 araji et al 2018 3 4 projected irrigated and rainfed maize yields futuristic rainfed and irrigated maize yield projections under the two emission scenarios were produced using each of the 18 gcms in aquacrop both the ensemble mean yield of the yields obtained using 18 gcm outputs and the standard deviation across yields obtained from all 18 gcms is presented in fig 4b and e respectively for rainfed and irrigated conditions fig 4b and 4e also show higher spread of inter gcm yield projections for rainfed conditions than irrigated conditions for rcp 4 5 the long term mean inter gcm 2020 2099 standard deviation in rainfed yields 4 6 t ha was 460 greater than that in irrigated yields 0 8 t ha while for rcp 8 5 this difference was 271 4 6 t ha vs 1 2 t ha rainfed yields are predominantly sensitive to precipitation than temperatures and this has been shown by kukal and irmak 2018a for the great plains region including clay county nebraska various gcms show lesser conformity among each other when predicting precipitation than temperatures ipcc 2021 this is because the physical processes governing precipitation are more complex and smaller scale resulting in greater noise and less predictability this contrasts with temperatures the physical processes governing which are larger scale and thus relatively easier to predict via anomalous boundary conditions responsible for them such as sea surface temperature consequently the aquacrop rainfed yield simulations demonstrate the same high inter gcm variability as well fig 4b it is interesting to note that the inter gcm yield variability fig 4b and 4e is comparable to the historical simulated yield variability fig 4a and 4d implying that observed future yields are very likely to vary anywhere within the inter gcm deviation bounds irrigated yields on the other hand do not experience water stress and thus see strong influence of inter gcm differences of air temperatures instead this is also evidenced by the observation that long term mean inter gcm standard deviation in irrigated yields was 52 greater under rcp 8 5 than rcp 4 5 implying lower conformity in gcm s to predict temperatures under rcp 8 5 however this was not true for rainfed yields where the long term mean inter gcm standard deviation was the same under both emission scenarios these observations support the argument for an appropriately wide selection of gcm to evaluate climate change impacts on maize yield this research used 18 gcm s which is sufficiently wide to confidently encounter inter model variability and is substantially greater than the number of gcms used in similar aquacrop driven assessments of yield projections yang et al 2017 2 gcms araji et al 2018 7 gcms dubey and sharma 2018 3 gcms rashid et al 2019 10 gcms the magnitudes of grain yields on a decadal basis for both rainfed and irrigated conditions are presented in fig 4c and 4f in general the graphics show higher yields in rcp 4 5 emission scenario than in rcp 8 5 resulting from increased negative impacts from higher radiative forcing or greenhouse gas concentrations on maize yields irrigated and rainfed maize yield is projected to decrease under both emission scenarios when compared to the baseline period projected 2020 2099 rainfed yields will decrease in the range of 0 01 0 1 to 3 53 t ha 1 44 3 under rcp 4 5 and from 0 01 0 1 to 3 67 t ha 1 46 1 under rcp 8 5 scenario on yearly basis projected irrigated yields will also decrease however by a relatively less severe amount ranging from 0 25 1 8 to 1 43 t ha 1 10 under rcp 4 5 and from 0 33 2 3 to 3 6 t ha 1 25 2 under rcp 8 5 the decadal analysis of relative change in future maize yield from baseline average yield in time slices of 2020s 2030s 2040s 2050s 2060s 2070s 2080s and 2090s is presented in fig 5 as has been true historically at the site increased growing season precipitation observed in fig 2d will be insufficient to meet crop water requirements irmak 2015a and thus rainfed yields will see water limitation driven declines under the two emission scenarios in contrast irrigated yield declines are temperature stress driven and this is evident from the pattern of consistently increasing yield declines as opposed to inconsistent rainfed yield decline patterns in fig 5a observed in fig 5b an additional evidence was the statistically significant p 0 05 negative linear trend found for irrigated yield trajectories fig 6a while no such trend was visible in rainfed yield trajectories fig 6a it is also evident that rainfed yields will decrease in greater magnitude than their irrigated counterparts for example the relative change that is projected for irrigated yields in the 2090 s is the same as what rainfed yields are projected to incur 6 decades earlier in 2030s fig 5 within both rcp scenarios higher maize yield is projected to decrease under rcp 8 5 for all decades except irrigated yields in 2030 s while the difference will vary substantially decadal rainfed maize yields declined in the range of 2 2 0 2 t ha to 17 1 4 t ha and 8 1 0 6 t ha to 21 5 1 7 t ha under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively on the other hand decadal irrigated maize yields decreased in the range of 3 7 0 5 t ha to 6 7 1 0 t ha and 4 3 0 6 t ha to 15 6 2 2 t ha under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively under irrigation the highest yield decline is projected towards the end of the century 2080s and 2090s in both rcp scenarios however the timing of substantial near maximal yield declines is distributed more uniformly across the century almost all decades showed 10 yield declines in at least one emission scenario as described earlier a combination of mechanisms could be responsible for these yield declines that are appropriately accounted for by process based crop models the gcm projections reflect increase in minimum temperatures by 2 13 c rcp 4 5 and 3 16 c rcp 8 5 during the emergence stage may that may result in failure of germination leading to loss in yields the increasingly high mean temperatures compared to baseline period during critical maize growth stages june august in both rcp scenarios can lead to reduction in grain filling period and enhance evaporative losses there are other studies that confirmed the similar findings results obtained in this research martins et al 2019 analyzed the impacts of climate change on maize yield in the brazilian northeast and showed that the climate change will negatively impact maize rainfed agriculture with more drastic yield losses to reach more than 60 under rcp 8 5 in late century 2071 2099 this extreme decline in maize productivity might be attributed to aquacrop model s high sensitivity to precipitation and low sensitivity to temperature relative to other crop models deb et al 2015 analyzed climate change impacts on maize cropping in the hilly terrain of himalayas in india and suggested significant declination in the maize yield ranging from 2 5 to 12 8 relative to baseline yield under future climate yang et al 2017 reported that predicted maize yields exhibited a continuous decrease from 2021 to 2080 with total decline in maize yield ranging from 3 to 10 under rcp 4 5 and 6 17 under rcp 8 5 relative to baseline contrary to our results dubey and sharma 2018 reported that the maize yield is projected to increase in the future 2021 2050 by 7 1 rcp 4 5 and 20 4 rcp 8 5 for the semi arid region in india when compared to the baseline period 1981 2010 likewise a trend of increase in maize yields under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios was also reported by srivastava et al 2018 in ghana they attributed this rise in yield to the increase in atmospheric co2 concentration suggesting that it has the potential to increase crop water productivity by enhancing photosynthesis and reducing leaf level transpiration they also confirmed that irrigation compensates for most of the loss of productivity however yields will still be substantially reduced by the elevated temperatures similarly delusca et al 2016 also justified the increase in maize yield due to elevated carbon dioxide concentrations and reported a 40 increase in maize yield under 550 ppm co2 than the ambient 387 ppm co2 concentration to evaluate the yield advantage associated with irrigated yields relative to rainfed conditions in the future we subtracted rainfed yield from irrigated yield values across the entire projection period for each scenario individually the resulting difference fig 6b was found to show a statistically significant p 0 05 decreasing trend for rcp 8 5 but no trend was detected under rcp 4 5 this is a direct consequence of the decreasing trend found for irrigated yields under both emission scenarios more negative trend under rcp 8 5 than rcp 4 5 while the slope of the rainfed yields was not statistically different from zero this implies that if all the technological and management factors are constant and only weather variability drives productivity the economic advantage associated with the adoption of irrigation will decline under rcp 8 5 this comparative metric of irrigated and rainfed yields has been termed as irrigation limited yield gap by kukal and irmak 2019 and has been quantified historically 1950 2015 across the contiguous u s for nine major irrigated crops they found that historically the gap has been increasing for most crops and regions at a rate of 1 02 kg ha 1 yr 1 implying that adoption of irrigation has been increasingly beneficial over this period integrating our findings with the ones from kukal and irmak 2019 concludes that while this positive historical trend will not continue in the future under rcp 4 5 it will most likely change its direction into a negative trend under rcp 8 5 in addition to the actual magnitudes of irrigated and rainfed yields it is critical to evaluate the projected interannual variability under future emission scenarios this is especially important because technological advances and management driven advances will likely improve maize yields further similar to historical nass yield trajectories in fig 3 and thus the absolute magnitudes of simulated yields should not be solely relied upon these potential improvements are not expected to be captured simulated by crop models and thus model simulations should instead be intended towards investigating year to year variability caused from weather shocks the gcm ensemble mean future yield trajectories fig 4b and 4c make it evident that there exists high interannual variability in future rainfed yields relative to irrigated yields for rcp 4 5 the cv of rainfed yields 0 15 was 873 greater than that of irrigated yields 0 02 similarly for rcp 8 5 the cv of rainfed yields 0 18 was 265 greater than that of irrigated yields 0 05 this comparative irrigated vs rainfed yield interannual variability is also worthwhile to look at during the entire projection period 2020 2099 to this end we computed residuals from a linear trajectory of maize yields presented in fig 6a and applied a modulus function to the residuals which we refer to as yield variability the long term projected mean variability for rainfed and irrigated yield was 0 81 t ha and 0 13 t ha respectively under rcp 4 5 the mean variability was higher under rcp 8 5 at 0 99 t ha and 0 33 t ha for rainfed and irrigated yields respectively thus rainfed yield variability was 533 and 200 greater than irrigated yield variability under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively among all the deviations from the yield trajectories computed for the projection period n 81 negative deviations were encountered 53 under rcp 4 5 and 49 under rcp 8 5 of the time for rainfed yield under rcp 4 5 negative deviations were slightly less frequent for irrigated yield with 47 rate of occurrence under both emission scenarios among the negative deviations the mean residual magnitude in rainfed yields was 0 76 t ha and 1 0 t ha under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively similarly the mean negative residual magnitude in irrigated yields was 0 14 t ha and 0 35 t ha under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively in contrast among the positive deviations the mean residual magnitude in rainfed yields was greater 0 86 t ha under rcp 4 5 and slightly lower 0 98 t ha under rcp 8 5 than its negative counterpart for irrigated yields the mean positive residual magnitudes were lower 0 12 and 0 31 t ha for both emission scenarios than its negative counterpart the absolute residuals were regressed against time and it was found that only irrigated yield variability under rcp 8 5 was shown to have a statistically significant p 0 01 increasing trend in time which was 16 of the mean variability per decade similar to trends in difference among irrigated and rainfed yields discussed earlier we also quantified the difference in yield variability among rainfed and irrigated yields for all growing seasons fig 6c and found that in the future this difference is projected to decrease rate of 11 per decade however only under rcp 8 5 this is a consequence of relative temporal behavior of relative and irrigated yield variabilities under rcp 8 5 irrigated yield variability increased while rainfed yield variability did not show any trend narrowing the difference between them this metric termed as irrigation induced reduction in yield variability iiryv has been quantified and discussed at length by kukal and irmak 2020 for nine major crops in the conus using 220 000 historical records they found that historical records point towards non significant trends since 1947 although the recent past 1980 s shows positive trends in maize iiryv the decreasing trend in fig 6c implies that as climate changes in south central nebraska the yield stabilizing benefit of irrigation relative to rainfed yields will diminish unlike what has been seen historically this effect is more severe when observed in combination with the decreased yield advantage associated with irrigation relative to rainfed conditions fig 6 recent modeling efforts in the ogallala aquifer ecosystems have shown that due to unsustainable pumping in significant irrigated areas transitioning to pasture or dryland production is projected these comparisons of yield advantage and stability will be increasingly important in assessment of dryland maize converted from irrigated maize this transition will more likely happen gradually via dependence on limited irrigation which has been locally found to increase water use efficiency irmak 2015a b the relative magnitudes of yield magnitude and stability under limited irrigation are logically supposed to lie between those of irrigated and rainfed conditions however these are out of the scope of this research 3 5 temperature and precipitation as drivers of irrigated vs maize yields temperatures and precipitation have complex impacts on crop yields along with other critical meteorological variables which can be appropriately only mechanistically represented using crop models in an attempt to decipher the contribution of temperature and precipitation on irrigated vs rainfed maize yields we regressed the change in model simulated maize yields from baseline conditions and change in tmin tmax tavg and precipitation during the growing season from baseline conditions in ordinary least square regression the regression plots are shown in fig 7 impact of air temperature change under rcp 4 5 fig 8 impact of air temperature change under rcp 8 5 and fig 9 impact of precipitation change under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 a negative correlation statistically significant at 95 c i existed between temperature and yield for rainfed and irrigated treatments under both rcps however there exists substantial difference in relative behavior of irrigated and rainfed yield to the same change in air temperatures across all the three metrics of rcp 4 5 air temperatures temperature variability was able to better explain irrigated yield variability than rainfed yield variability fig 7 specifically by 229 difference of r2 under irrigated and rainfed conditions relative to r2 under rainfed conditions 126 and 163 for tmin tmax and tavg however the sensitivity of maize yield to a unit increase in respective metrics of air temperatures was greater in rainfed maize than irrigated maize this difference of sensitivity t ha 1 c 1 among rainfed and irrigated yields was 183 245 and 214 for tmin tmax and tavg respectively while tmax has greater by 6 sensitivity than tmin for rainfed yields tmin was more important by 15 than tmax for irrigated yields which resulted in a lower sensitivity difference among rainfed and irrigated yields for tmin than tmax now a similar assessment for rcp 8 5 fig 8 suggests that the greater increase in air temperatures will manifest as a non linear decrease in irrigated yields while rainfed yields maintained a relatively weaker linear relationship with air temperatures thus if additional warming beyond that projected for rcp 4 5 occurs seasonal tavg 4 c irrigated yields will suffer drastically with a non linear response direct comparisons were not made among irrigated and rainfed sensitivities due to their contrasting response behavior to change in air temperatures again as seen under rcp 4 5 tmax was slightly more important for rainfed yields than tmin while the opposite was true for irrigated yields rainfed yield sensitivity to a unit increase in air temperature can be seemingly interpreted to decrease under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 see a decrease in slope coefficients under rcp 8 5 but such a comparison would be unfair given the vastly different range of air temperatures under the two emission scenarios also as it was observed earlier rainfed yield variability is explained to a higher proportion by precipitation instead of air temperatures this was confirmed quantitatively from fig 9 which shows that precipitation change explained 46 and 50 of the variability observed in rainfed yield change under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 which was 100 and 733 greater than what was explained for irrigated yield variability under these scenarios thus while precipitation change was a reasonable driver for irrigated yields under rcp 4 5 r2 of 0 23 its role was only slightly important under rcp 8 5 similar to the findings of this research araji et al 2018 reported that the final yield under no water stress and with mild water stress were significantly correlated with tmax and tmin while under sever water stress the yield was significantly correlated with precipitation at 95 confidence level in a great plains wide assessment kukal and irmak 2018a found that climate temperature and precipitation explained maize yield variability under rainfed conditions was 436 higher than irrigated crops and that rainfed yield variability was largely explained by both precipitation and temperature whereas temperature alone explained irrigated yield variability they also found that sensitivity of rainfed maize to temperature was twice that of irrigated maize while precipitation sensitivity for rainfed maize was 43 times that of irrigated maize the high tmax are mechanistically responsible for shortening the duration of reproductive development causing yield declines leakey 2009 which has been observed in the us midwest mishra and cherkauer 2010 high tmin however causes increased nighttime respiration consequently negatively affecting the amount of photoassimilates available for plant growth and yield sadok and jagadish 2020 the results of this study should be viewed with adequate understanding of the assumptions and conditions under which these estimates were derived the research presents a future scenario where hybrids and crop and soil management have not adapted to the changed environment most likely these adaptation measures as well as technological advances will continue in the future as they have in the past and produce gains in maize yield potential the linearly increasing trends evident from the historical nass maize yield trajectories fig 3 are a result of development of improved hybrids stress tolerance less reliant on insecticides increased pest and disease resistance higher standability longer maturity duration reduced time input per acre resource capture etc selection of these hybrids kucharik 2008 planting date adaptations kucharik 2006 a more conducive microclimate butler et al 2018 plant growth enhancement due to higher carbon dioxide levels twine et al 2013 precision agriculture advances schimmelpfennig 2016 yost et al 2017 and others these potential adaptations were not included in the modeling exercise and in some cases are challenging to project and model at the same time there is recent evidence to suggest that these adaptation measures have resulted in heightened climate sensitivity in the u s corn belt ortiz bobea et al 2018 lobell et al 2020 thus given uncertain future roadmaps these results should only be viewed as a comparison of how yields under sufficient moisture availability vs precipitation reliant moisture availability will fare in the future under the current management regimes the model also does not consider the potential impacts that will likely result from the ongoing realization of increased environmental impacts of a intensive agricultural system including carbon emissions crippa et al 2021 and water quality impacts kling et al 2014 the relative behavior of irrigated vs rainfed yields projected in this research informs how the limited irrigation water that will be available in the region should be allocated when grain yield is the sole target the producer operations and policy and decision making around the water allocation must consider how grain yields vs availability of irrigation dynamics will evolve in the near and distant future the multi model 18 gcms assessment used in this research prioritize accounting for the uncertainty introduced into the yield projections because of an uncertain climate future to evaluate if the negative impacts on yield can be countered and if so to what extent research should evaluate various adaptive management options in a futuristic and realistic framework 4 conclusions the projected climate conditions simulated from an ensemble of 18 gcms were observed to negatively affect both irrigated and rainfed maize yields in general under rainfed conditions maize yield is projected to decrease in the range of 2 2 17 in rcp 4 5 and from 8 1 to 21 5 in rcp 8 5 scenario on a decadal 10 year average basis for irrigated conditions the yield is expected to decrease from 3 7 to 6 7 in rcp 4 5 and from 4 3 to 15 6 in rcp 8 5 scenario we found that the economic advantage associated with the adoption of irrigation will decline under rcp 8 5 this will be exacerbated by rainfed yields showing more than fivefold and two fold variability than irrigated yields under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively the yield stabilizing benefit of irrigation relative to rainfed yields will diminish as the projected difference among rainfed and irrigated yield variability is projected to decrease rate of 11 per decade under rcp 8 5 temperatures were able to better explain irrigated than rainfed yield variability however the sensitivity of maize yield to air temperature was greater in rainfed than irrigated maize by 183 245 and 214 for tmin tmax and tavg respectively while tmax was more important than tmin for rainfed yields the opposite was true for irrigated yields additional warming in rcp 8 5 beyond that projected under rcp 4 5 is projected to result in non linear decrease in irrigated yields on the other hand precipitation change explained 46 and 50 of the variability observed in rainfed yield change under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 which was 100 and 733 greater than what was explained for irrigated yield variability these analyses can be valuable for policy and decision makers and agricultural and water resources managers professionals to evaluate the future tradeoffs among irrigation and rainfed yields and how landscapes are projected to perform under two scenarios absent

9755,eighteen global circulation models gcms were evaluated to determine the potential impacts of future climate change on irrigated and rainfed maize yields using the fao aquacrop model on an inter annual and decadal basis 2020 s until 2090 s prior to deemed fit for future simulations aquacrop model was subject to comprehensive calibration and validation using extensive field measured long term datasets we observed declines in decadal rainfed maize yields ranging from 2 2 0 2 t ha to 17 1 4 t ha and from 8 1 0 6 t ha to 21 5 1 7 t ha under representative concentration pathways rcps rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively the range of declines was lower for irrigated yields 3 7 0 5 t ha to 6 7 1 0 t ha and 4 3 0 6 t ha to 15 6 2 2 t ha under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively near maximal yield declines were distributed uniformly across the century and almost all decades exhibited 10 yield declines under at least one emission scenario both economic grain yield advantage associated with irrigation difference in irrigated and rainfed yields and yield stabilizing benefit of irrigation difference in rainfed and irrigated yield variability are projected to decrease significantly p 0 05 under rcp 8 5 rainfed maize yield variability was 533 and 200 greater than irrigated yield variability under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively for rcp 4 5 the long term mean inter gcm 2020 2099 standard deviation in rainfed yields 4 6 t ha was 460 greater than that in irrigated yields 0 8 t ha while for rcp 8 5 this difference was 271 4 6 t ha vs 1 2 t ha tmax and tmin were able to explain more variability in irrigated than rainfed maize yields the difference being 229 and 126 respectively precipitation change explained 46 and 50 of the variability in rainfed yield change under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively and was 100 and 733 greater than what was explained for irrigated yield variability the research findings hold significance for water allocation considering how dynamics of grain yields vs availability of irrigation may manifest in the future keywords aquacrop climate impacts rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 global circulation models 1 introduction global climate is very likely to warm by 1 2 1 9 c in the near term 2021 2040 ipcc 2021 the global mean surface temperature was 0 99 c higher during 2001 2020 than during the pre industrial period of 1850 1900 ipcc 2021 climate change has already impacted crop productivity of major agricultural crops across global agro ecosystems lobell et al 2011 kukal and irmak 2018a 2012 lobell and asner 2003 leng 2017 ray et al 2015 2019 these changes in climate characteristics are projected to manifest as increased mean air temperatures in most land and ocean regions hot extremes heavy precipitation and increased probability of drought and precipitation deficits such climate shocks and shifts will impact crop yield cultivation area and food supply thereby having major implications on sustainable agricultural development and poverty eradication goals climatic variability has been reported to explain more than 60 of the maize rice wheat and soybean yield variations in the global primary breadbasket areas ray et al 2015 thus assessment of the impacts of magnitude and variations in historical and future climate on crop yield is critical to ensuring food security for rapidly growing world population the intensity and direction of climate change impacts on crop production are complex uncertain and may result in net positive or negative outcomes the reductions in crop yields as a result of climate change are reported to be more common than crop yield benefits porter et al 2014 crop production is negatively affected by climate change due to increase in climate extremes that include changes in rainfall extremes increases in hot nights extremely high daytime temperatures drought events heat stress flooding chilling damage spread of pests and diseases studies have reported that maize and wheat yields start declining with 1 2 c of local warming and under nitrogen stress conditions at low latitude areas porter et al 2014 overall a significant reduction in crop yield of four major commodity crops including wheat by 6 rice by 3 2 maize by 7 4 and soybean by 3 1 has been projected for each degree celsius rise in global mean temperature zhao et al 2017 on the other hand warming may benefit crop production in higher latitude areas with more fertile soils favoring crops and grassland production in contrast to the areas at low latitudes climate variations have also been reported to cause lengthening of the growing season due to earlier start and later end of the growing season qian et al 2010 skaggs and irmak 2012 while some reports indicate that increase in atmospheric co2 concentrations increased yields by improving radiation and water use efficiencies the effects of co2 fertilization on crops are still uncertain and vary within c3 and c4 crop species this implies that the climate change impacts cannot be generalized as they vary with crop type and site thus it is very important to conduct crop and site specific impact assessments while carrying out future projections to better understand potential dynamics between climate change and agricultural productivity this research was conducted to quantify and analyze the impacts of climate variability on south central nebraska maize productivity maize is the largest crop grown in the u s a accounting for approximately 31 3 of the world maize production usda fas 2020 nebraska is ranked as the third state contributing the most to the total u s maize production 13 0 environmental conditions in nebraska and the high plains region is highly variable as indicated by recent droughts 1983 2002 2005 2012 2017 heat waves 2000 2002 2006 2010 2011 and floods 2001 2007 2008 2011 2019 changes in the observed frequency and intensity of extreme weather events are major concerns for agriculture and will most likely negatively impact agricultural productivity in the u s great plains states and around the world the warming of 1 5 oc has been reported for the global scale in the last century ipcc 2021 and as many other regions nebraska has experienced warming since the beginning of 20th century mostly during winter and spring months irmak et al 2012 2018 kukal and irmak 2017 the length of frost free season has increased by 5 25 days across nebraska and is projected to increase in future decades skaggs and irmak et al 2012 kukal and irmak 2018b the percentage of average annual precipitation in the form of heavy rainfall events has increased for portions of northern great plains states including eastern nebraska and the midwest and this trend is projected to continue in future decades increasing the flood magnitudes irmak et al 2012 irmak 2018 climate change impacts many agricultural practices including hydrologic variables precipitation runoff deep percolation etc crop irrigation requirements evapotranspiration etc irrigation is one of the major reasons for consistent and high yields of maize in nebraska and other great plains states nebraska has higher irrigated acres under maize than any other u s state and state s crop production is highly dependent on surface and groundwater resources and precipitation both of which are subject to consequences from climate change and variability thus identifying the climate change impacts under both rainfed and irrigated maize production is crucial to assess and quantify changes in maize yield for future policy and decision making and developing best agricultural production and management practices and adoption to such changes the complex and multi way interactions among climatic elements and crop parameters require a multifaceted mechanistic and comprehensive assessments process based crop simulation models are valuable tools to evaluate crop response to climate variations the fao aquacrop model was developed to predict attainable crop growth water use and yield parameters for various crops under water limiting conditions aquacrop model was chosen to study the impact of climate changes on maize yield because 1 it has been calibrated and validated for the study region sandhu and irmak 2019b 2 it performs well for simulating maize crop s responses under a wide array of environmental conditions and nutrient management scenarios dale et al 2017 foster et al 2017 heng et al 2009 abedinpour et al 2012 hsiao et al 2009 ahmadi et al 2015 and 3 it has been used in crop impact projection studies globally and is often intended for policy outcomes bouras et al 2019 stevens and madani 2016 dale et al 2017 the detailed theoretical background and concepts of aquacrop are provided by steduto et al 2009 and raes et al 2009 the particular features that distinguishes aquacrop from other crop models include 1 its focus solely on water 2 the use of canopy cover cc for simulating crop growth and development and water use instead of leaf area index as cc is more readily available and known to users other than researchers 3 the use of water productivity that allows extended application of model to diverse climates locations and seasons 4 the relatively low number of input parameters and most of which are explicit and mostly intuitive as compared with other models 5 a well developed user interface and availability of open source code with appropriate documentation and 6 its considerable balance between accuracy simplicity and robustness therefore aquacrop model was selected for this study to determine and evaluate long term future and past irrigated and rainfed maize productivity relationships with climate irrigation is often discussed as a mitigation tool for decoupling of crop production and climate variability impacts although the role of irrigation on historical crop yields is adequately addressed kukal and irmak 2019 2020 troy et al 2015 li and troy 2018 limited knowledge exists on how these benefits will sustain in the future especially with respect to rainfed crop production it is critical to understand the evolution of crop yield tradeoffs that result from conversion of irrigated to rainfed cropland due to lack of freshwater resources limited knowledge exists on how climate change and variability will impact maize yield in the most intensely irrigated conditions of the u s this is especially critical to quantify to be able to better analyze project and plan groundwater depletion vs agricultural water requirements and crop productivity relationships with the potential groundwater resources limitations in the future the region may experience conversion of irrigated to rainfed farmland deines et al 2020 in this context it is important to develop irrigated and rainfed yield projections under different emission scenarios to help understand the economic tradeoff among more stable and higher yields and irrigation capital which currently constitute significant knowledge gaps the objective of this study is to assess the impacts of climate parameters projected by 18 gcms during the remainder of the 21st century 2020 2099 on irrigated and rainfed maize yields under two different emission scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 ultimately the relative performance of irrigated maize is evaluated against that of rainfed maize to project the sensitivity of the two different crop management regimes against climate change and variability 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area maize accounts for 9 81 million acres and 92 million acres of land use in nebraska and the u s respectively usda nass 2020 and thus was selected for this research due to its regional and national importance the research was conducted in the irmak research laboratory for soil and climatic conditions of south central agricultural laboratory at the university of nebraska lincoln 40 34 n and 98 8 w at an elevation of 552 m above mean sea level near clay center nebraska the study site is considered to be representative of agricultural management practices in the region and represents the most densely irrigated region in the central plains of the u s the research site lies at the transition zone between dry sub humid and semi arid climate zones with the long term 1980 2010 mean annual precipitation of 731 mm average annual temperature of 10 3 c and average annual snowfall of 381 mm the site is also characterized by significant annual and growing season variability of precipitation in both magnitude and timing the soil at the site is a hastings silt loam with field capacity of 0 34 m3 m 3 permanent wilting point of 0 14 m3 m 3 saturation point of 0 53 m3 m 3 and saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of 430 mm day 1 irmak 2010 maize is usually planted in late april to mid may period and usually harvested in october the most common cropping system is maize soybean rotation with increasing land area under continuous maize irmak

description and pre processing historical climate data 1983 2019 for the site was obtained from an automated weather data station courtesy of high plains regional climate center hprcc this period was considered as the baseline scenario against which all future projected variables were compared in this research daily climate data for the baseline period included precipitation mm maximum and minimum air temperatures c relative humidity solar radiation mj m 2 day 1 and wind speed m s 1 daily standardized grass reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated in aquacrop model using the asce standardized penman monteith equation asce ewri 2005 for climate change projections downscaled output from 18 general circulation models gcm s participating in the fifth coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 were used to extract climate data for future aquacrop simulations table 1 lists the names country and agency of development for each of the 18 models used the downscaled output for air temperatures at 2 m height incoming shortwave solar radiation wind speed at 10 m height specific humidity at 2 m height and precipitation were obtained for a 1 16 degree approx 6 km grid cell around the study site the data was obtained for two representative concentration pathways rcps 4 5 and 8 5 for 2020 2099 the rcp 4 5 scenario is a stabilization scenario implying that radiative forcing level stabilizes at 4 5 wm 2 prior to 2100 due to adoption of a range of technologies and strategies for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions in the rcp 8 5 emissions scenario the radiative forcing level reaches 8 5 wm 2 due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions as represented in the literature leading to high greenhouse gas concentration levels bias correction and statistical downscaling of all the climate variables obtained from each model were performed using the multivariate adaptive constructed analogs approach maca version 2 abatzoglou and brown 2012 maca is a statistical approach to downscale gcm outputs from their original coarser spatial resolution to a higher resolution and the bias corrected downscaled gcm data is available at http maca northwestknowledge net the maca datasets offer two contiguous us wide products that use 20 cmip5 gcms and vary by the training data used we obtained the datasets that used 6 km 1 16th degree daily product of livneh et al 2015 two variables that were obtained from the maca dataset had to be processed before use in aquacrop model simulations firstly wind speed at 10 m height was converted to wind speed at 2 m height using logarithmic wind speed profile relationships outlined in the asce ewri 2005 1 u 2 u z 4 87 ln 67 8 z 5 42 where u2 is wind speed at 2 m above ground surface m s 1 uz is wind speed at z m above ground surface m s 1 and z is height of measurement above ground surface m in this research z was 10 m as obtained from maca dataset also specific humidity sh was converted to relative humidity rh using the following equation xxx relationship 2 rh 100 sh ρ e s 0 622 where sh is in kg kg 1 obtained from maca and ρ is the atmospheric pressure corrected for elevation kpa which is estimated by 3 ρ ρ sea level 293 0 0065 elevation 5 26 293 where ρ sea level is the pressure at sea level 101 3 kpa and elevation is the elevation m above sea level 552 m for the study site finally the data was manipulated from raw maca obtained files in formats appropriate for aquacrop input files following standard practice the aquacrop simulations were carried out independently using climate data from each of the 18 gcm s and then representing final results using an ensemble mean of 18 aquacrop derived variables the same 18 gcms have been successfully used by ficklin and novick 2017 to investigate atmospheric drying across the conus during 2065 2099 in addition to assessing the crop yield for each year from 2020 to 2099 future decadal time slices representing 2020s 2030s 2040s 2050s 2060s 2070s 2080s and 2090s were chosen to obtain quantitative estimates of climate change impacts on maize production the atmospheric co2 concentrations were obtained from the mauna loa observatory for the baseline period and from rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios for the future period that were available in the aquacrop database 2 3 aquacrop model the climate change impacts and scenarios in this study were evaluated using aquacrop model aquacrop is a user friendly and practitioner oriented type of model which consists of four sub models 1 the atmosphere sub model consisting of rainfall reference evapotranspiration and co2 concentration 2 crop sub model involving crop growth development senescence and yield 3 management sub model including irrigation and field management practices 4 soil sub model handling soil water balance with a daily timestep the model simulates successively the four major processes of crop production including crop development transpiration tr above ground biomass production and finally yield formation the model is considered to be relatively simple yet very robust in simulating different plant growth and development processes the model has been widely used for climate change studies to simulate the effects of increased temperatures and co2 fertilization muluneh et al 2015 shrestha and shrestha 2016 vanuytrecht et al 2011 detailed model concepts principles and assumptions are discussed by steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2009 and hsiao et al 2009 the model has been calibrated for the study region by sandhu and irmak 2019a using extensive and long term field measured datasets from irmak 2015a and the calibration procedure was performed using the guidelines outlined in the aquacrop reference manual and anon 2012 the default and calibrated parameters variables are presented in table 2 comprehensive evaluation of model was conducted by sandhu and irmak 2019a by calibrating and validating the model using a wide range of field observed datasets in addition to adjusting other parameters of the model water productivity and transpiration crop coefficients were adjusted for the study site as well to calibrate biomass and yield the calibrated model indicated good agreement between simulated and field measured canopy cover r2 0 86 ef 0 83 and nrmse 7 3 soil water content in the root zone r2 0 88 ef 0 61 and nrmse 5 2 crop evapotranspiration r2 0 97 ef 0 80 and nrmse 3 2 and final grain yield r2 0 99 ef 0 80 and nrmse 7 7 in the current study the water productivity parameter was continuously adjusted in the aquacrop model based on the selected rcp scenarios such as rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 available in the model database this resulted in adjusting water productivity as a function of given atmospheric co2 concentration for that year therefore impacts of climate change were assessed using the guidelines specified in aquacrop manual aquacrop manual states that the simulations of future crop yields should consider the increase of the atmospheric co2 concentration the increase in co2 which induces co2 fertilization reduces slightly the crop transpiration tr and increases strongly the biomass water productivity wp the effect of the decrease in crop transpiration for elevated co2 concentration is considered by multiplying the crop transpiration coefficient kctr x with an adjustment factor fco2 tr 1 when running a simulation with a co2 different from the reference value i e 369 41 ppm for the year 2000 wp is adjusted with a correction factor fco2 1 for co2 369 1 ppm as of 2011 there has been an update in the aquacrop model that allows the model to treat c3 and c4 crops differently as the positive co2 effect on c4 crops is mainly confined to decreased crop transpiration vanuytrecht et al 2011 2 4 model input and management parameters input data for aquacrop model consist of both conservative and less conservative parameters the values of conservative parameters can be set as default while the less conservative parameters need to be adjusted based on crop cultivar site and management conditions the model parameters used in his study were obtained from multiple sources including field measurements local experience and literature sandhu and irmak 2019b calibrated and validated the aquacrop model for nebraska using extensive field measured datasets and established a set of model parameters for the study site these calibrated parameters were used to perform simulations of climate impacts in this study most of the non conservative parameters including plating density planting depth maximum root depth etc were obtained from irmak 2015a and are considered as representative of the agronomic practices followed in nebraska the simulations were performed using fixed planting date of may 1 which is the most representative planting date in nebraska this value was reached after careful planting date analysis of maize in nebraska based on united states department of agriculture usda statistics usda nass 2019 the procedure involved selecting the week when more than 50 of the maize was planted and the mid of the selected week was adopted as the most common planting date the conservative parameters used in the model were those compiled by sandhu and irmak 2019a b for the study area the adaptation measure tested in this study was irrigation management precipitation amounts and timings vary during each growing season that necessitates supplemental irrigation in the region irrigated maize yields and crop water use efficiencies have been reported to be greater than rainfed fields irmak 2015b evaluated maize irrigation strategies for nebraska and reported that six year average grain yields and crop water use efficiencies ranged from 9 10 to 15 32 mg ha and 1 73 2 34 kg m3 under rainfed and full irrigation treatments respectively therefore irrigation is considered as valuable adaptation strategy to increase agricultural productivity in the era of climate change consequently simulations were performed using net irrigation water requirement option available in aquacrop it calculates the total amount of water required by crop to avoid stress but does not take into account the efficiency of irrigation system specific irrigation schedules and irrigation method the model supplements small amounts of irrigation water to maintain soil moisture between field capacity and pre defined level of depletion of readily available water raw in the root zone although this option does not reflect actual field conditions and irrigation schedules followed by growers it is a valuable method for assessment of irrigation demands for climate change scenarios in this study irrigation treatment was automatically applied by the model when pre defined raw was depleted that was the threshold below which stomatal closure stress begins in the crop this irrigation scenario was defined as full irrigation treatment considering the fact that plants do not suffer any drought stress and soil water is restored to near field capacity approximately 90 of field capacity in each irrigation at the start of growing season the soil profile is replenished by pre season snowfall and rainfall events thus the initial soil water content is considered to be at field capacity the simulations for both baseline period and future scenarios were initialized at field capacity in each growing season 2 5 baseline and future yield comparisons for each emission scenario including rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 long term maize yield from 2020 to 2099 was forecasted using aquacrop model under both irrigated and rainfed settings using climate projections from all 18 gcms subsequently the final average maize yield was calculated for baseline period 1983 2019 and future climate the variation of yield among 18 gcms was calculated using standard deviation from the mean and was presented as a spread area in the graphs the averaged values of yield for the future period under both emission scenarios were compared to the corresponding values of the baseline period yield forecasts were also evaluated using decadal time slices ranging from 2020 s to 2090 s and the observed standard deviation in each decade was also presented the effects of climate change and management scenarios on grain yield were presented as percent relative change from the baseline period 3 results and discussion 3 1 historical climate characteristics 1983 2019 the average historical climatic parameters including precipitation maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin and average temperature tavg over the period of 1983 2019 are presented in fig 1a for the historical period tavg varied from 3 9 23 9 c tmin from 10 2 17 4 c and tmax from 2 3 to 30 5 c with lowest temperatures occurring in january and the highest in july overall the higher temperatures were recorded for the months of june july and august the highest precipitation amounts greater than 53 mm were mostly concentrated in summer months starting from april to october thus coinciding with the maize growing season the precipitation regime at the site is quite favorable for maize growth due to high precipitation occurring at the start of growing season with average amounts of 55 mm in april and 112 mm in may moreover snow events during winter months provide ample snow water equivalent in spring resulting in near field capacity soil conditions at crop planting this soil water storage from dormant season precipitation is sufficient to sustain crop through may without supplemental irrigation the water deficits in conjunction with non optimal seasonal distribution and timing of precipitation coincide with the most water sensitive physiological stages of maize requiring irrigation applications 3 2 projections of future 2020 2099 climate characteristics under emission scenarios the changes in future climatic conditions vs historical conditions for precipitation and temperature are represented in fig 1b and 1c in terms of difference between long term 2020 2099 mean forecasted values under both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively the ensemble mean projections of all 18 gcms indicate that the monthly minimum maximum and average temperatures tmin tmax tavg are projected to rise under both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios in comparison to the baseline period indicating a stronger warming trend in rcp 8 5 relative to rcp 4 5 as anticipated significant warming was projected for the entire maize growing season under rcp 4 5 and the entire calendar year under rcp 8 5 with the exception of slight warming in march this holds significance for temperature impacts on all maize physiological stages as well resource use dynamics the highest tavg increase will be observed in the month of august 3 6 c for rcp 4 5 and 5 1 c for rcp 8 5 which is critical for crop productivity as this period coincides with reproductive phase grain filling for example of maize on an average monthly tmin tmax and tavg ranged from 8 1 20 1 c 3 8 34 4 c and 2 2 27 3 c under rcp 4 5 and from 6 9 21 5 c 5 1 35 8 c and 0 9 28 7 c under rcp 8 5 respectively during the year on the other hand the future mean monthly precipitation is projected to range from 17 mm to 117 mm under both scenarios with highest precipitation amounts in may and lowest in january under both scenarios increased precipitation is projected for the months of november to may which mostly marks the dormant season in the region outside of this dormant window however the projected precipitation amounts are higher for july and september but lower for june august and october these inconsistent monthly projections mean that precipitation deficits or surpluses can occur at various maize growth stages the precipitation deficits projected for august for example in conjunction with warmer air temperatures may result in higher heat stress drought conditions and higher irrigation water demand during grain fill on the other hand the dormant season precipitation surplus projected for the region implies increased soil water availability for early season maize growth and lower pressure on irrigation water resources however this could also mean undesirably high soil moisture that hinders timely planting operations resulting in greater risk of exposure to frost events and shorter growing seasons among all the possible mechanisms of climate impacts on maize yields some will exacerbate or counteract others and dictate whether crop yields will be benefitted or impaired further the changes in average maize growing season may september air temperatures and precipitation were evaluated on a decadal basis in time slices of 2020s 2030s 2040s 2050s 2060s 2070s 2080s and 2090s the differences between average growing seasonal baseline 1983 2019 and decadal time slice conditions were presented in fig 2 the forecasted climate projections on decadal basis indicate rise in growing season temperatures for each consequent decade under both scenarios higher for rcp 8 5 than rcp 4 5 implying that maize will be exposed to warmer conditions in each of the succeeding decade the increase in decadal tmin tmax and tavg growing season temperatures relative to baseline period will range from 1 5 to 3 2 c 2 1 4 1 c and 1 8 3 7 c under rcp 4 5 and 1 7 6 3 c 2 4 7 4 c and 2 1 6 9 c under rcp 8 5 respectively the difference among rcp 8 5 than rcp 4 5 projected temperatures will widen for each succeeding decade this widening was observed for tmax and tavg in every succeeding decade except 2030 s while tmin showed no exceptions similarly total amount of growing season precipitation is projected to increase for all decades except for 2040s and 2090s in rcp 8 5 scenarios relative to the baseline period overall increase in seasonal precipitation amounts compared to baseline period ranged from 4 7 to 35 2 mm in rcp 4 5 and from 1 5 42 7 mm in rcp 8 5 scenario decadal analysis indicated no consistent trend between rcps 4 5 and 8 5 for predicting seasonal precipitation such that rcp 8 5 exhibited higher seasonal amounts only in 2030 s and 2050 s and rcp 4 5 exhibited higher precipitation in the rest of the decades the dominant increasing trend in growing season precipitation could affect maize in two contrasting ways it could either alleviate crop water stress by improving effective moisture available in the soil profile and thus relieving pressure on irrigation water resources the higher air temperatures and changes in other meteorological variables impacts on crop water demand will have to be weighed against additional water availability to determine net impacts on maize irrigation water demand cook et al 2015 concluded from a diversity of gcms and metrics that us central plains will see a drying response to warming drought conditions in the latter half of the 21st century which is unprecedented in the last millennium the increased precipitation can prove useful to alleviate effects of heat waves especially in rainfed maize which could become more dominant as water limitations for irrigation exacerbate alternatively if the distribution of the increased precipitation is not uniform and is characterized by extreme nature it could instead negatively harm maize yields by creating anaerobic conditions and lodging it has been recently shown that only rare hourly rainfall extremes 50 mm hr 1 are detrimental to us maize yields while they benefit from heavy rainfall up to 20 mm hr 1 lesk et al 2020 lesk et al 2020 also projected that future rainfall intensification will slightly offset yield declines from excessive heat and results in a net benefit of 1 3 3 3 irrigated and rainfed maize yield under baseline conditions the historical maize yields for clay county ne were obtained from united states department of agriculture s national agriculture statistics service usda nass individually for rainfed and irrigated conditions the rainfed maize yield varied from 2 1 to 9 7 t ha 1 with high fluctuations across the years the irrigated yields ranged from 6 8 to 13 6 t ha 1 with significantly lower fluctuations across years than its rainfed counterpart on the other hand the aquacrop simulated maize yield were in range of 0 14 8 t ha 1 for rainfed and 12 4 15 6 for irrigated conditions the comparisons of the standardized divided by their averages nass historical 1983 2018 and model simulated maize yields indicate that while the fluctuations in clay county maize yield caused by water stress are accurately captured fig 3a and b the magnitudes of the simulated yields are mostly greater than nass yields for rainfed conditions and always greater for irrigated conditions simulated maize yields showed 97 greater variability measured by coefficient of variation cv than nass rainfed yields and 70 lower variability than nass irrigated yields this is expected as nass yield data are representative of diversified producer fields with respect to crop and soil characteristics and management variety selection irrigation management etc moreover higher weed pressure fertility stresses and salinity stresses may exist in some fields in the county thereby reducing nass maize yields the study site however is a maximum productivity research environment with optimal crop and soil management finally nass yields represent fields that vary in their planting dates each year owing to planting conditions while the simulated yields were obtained assuming a fixed planting date of may 1 these inconsistencies will not significantly compromise the model predictions at regional scale as more weight is given to the interannual variability in yield rather than the absolute numbers nass yields also show a clear increasing trend over the historical period as it accounts for the advances in technology and management that producers have adopted in the state which aquacrop and other crop models cannot account for and thus do not demonstrate increased yield trends in time due to these reasons nass data cannot be fairly compared to model yield simulations instead these model simulations have been validated for the site by sandhu and irmak 2019a during 2005 2010 who found that the aquacrop model simulated maize yield agreed with observed values with maximum normalized root mean square error nrmse of 12 1 and model efficiency coefficient ef of 0 7 for the given site thus aquacrop model can serve as a useful tool to forecast predict impacts of climate change variables on maize production the aquacrop model has been found to be a valuable tool to successfully assess the response of major crops including maize wheat barley and soybean to climate change scenarios in the past yang et al 2017 rashid et al 2019 dubey and sharma 2018 araji et al 2018 3 4 projected irrigated and rainfed maize yields futuristic rainfed and irrigated maize yield projections under the two emission scenarios were produced using each of the 18 gcms in aquacrop both the ensemble mean yield of the yields obtained using 18 gcm outputs and the standard deviation across yields obtained from all 18 gcms is presented in fig 4b and e respectively for rainfed and irrigated conditions fig 4b and 4e also show higher spread of inter gcm yield projections for rainfed conditions than irrigated conditions for rcp 4 5 the long term mean inter gcm 2020 2099 standard deviation in rainfed yields 4 6 t ha was 460 greater than that in irrigated yields 0 8 t ha while for rcp 8 5 this difference was 271 4 6 t ha vs 1 2 t ha rainfed yields are predominantly sensitive to precipitation than temperatures and this has been shown by kukal and irmak 2018a for the great plains region including clay county nebraska various gcms show lesser conformity among each other when predicting precipitation than temperatures ipcc 2021 this is because the physical processes governing precipitation are more complex and smaller scale resulting in greater noise and less predictability this contrasts with temperatures the physical processes governing which are larger scale and thus relatively easier to predict via anomalous boundary conditions responsible for them such as sea surface temperature consequently the aquacrop rainfed yield simulations demonstrate the same high inter gcm variability as well fig 4b it is interesting to note that the inter gcm yield variability fig 4b and 4e is comparable to the historical simulated yield variability fig 4a and 4d implying that observed future yields are very likely to vary anywhere within the inter gcm deviation bounds irrigated yields on the other hand do not experience water stress and thus see strong influence of inter gcm differences of air temperatures instead this is also evidenced by the observation that long term mean inter gcm standard deviation in irrigated yields was 52 greater under rcp 8 5 than rcp 4 5 implying lower conformity in gcm s to predict temperatures under rcp 8 5 however this was not true for rainfed yields where the long term mean inter gcm standard deviation was the same under both emission scenarios these observations support the argument for an appropriately wide selection of gcm to evaluate climate change impacts on maize yield this research used 18 gcm s which is sufficiently wide to confidently encounter inter model variability and is substantially greater than the number of gcms used in similar aquacrop driven assessments of yield projections yang et al 2017 2 gcms araji et al 2018 7 gcms dubey and sharma 2018 3 gcms rashid et al 2019 10 gcms the magnitudes of grain yields on a decadal basis for both rainfed and irrigated conditions are presented in fig 4c and 4f in general the graphics show higher yields in rcp 4 5 emission scenario than in rcp 8 5 resulting from increased negative impacts from higher radiative forcing or greenhouse gas concentrations on maize yields irrigated and rainfed maize yield is projected to decrease under both emission scenarios when compared to the baseline period projected 2020 2099 rainfed yields will decrease in the range of 0 01 0 1 to 3 53 t ha 1 44 3 under rcp 4 5 and from 0 01 0 1 to 3 67 t ha 1 46 1 under rcp 8 5 scenario on yearly basis projected irrigated yields will also decrease however by a relatively less severe amount ranging from 0 25 1 8 to 1 43 t ha 1 10 under rcp 4 5 and from 0 33 2 3 to 3 6 t ha 1 25 2 under rcp 8 5 the decadal analysis of relative change in future maize yield from baseline average yield in time slices of 2020s 2030s 2040s 2050s 2060s 2070s 2080s and 2090s is presented in fig 5 as has been true historically at the site increased growing season precipitation observed in fig 2d will be insufficient to meet crop water requirements irmak 2015a and thus rainfed yields will see water limitation driven declines under the two emission scenarios in contrast irrigated yield declines are temperature stress driven and this is evident from the pattern of consistently increasing yield declines as opposed to inconsistent rainfed yield decline patterns in fig 5a observed in fig 5b an additional evidence was the statistically significant p 0 05 negative linear trend found for irrigated yield trajectories fig 6a while no such trend was visible in rainfed yield trajectories fig 6a it is also evident that rainfed yields will decrease in greater magnitude than their irrigated counterparts for example the relative change that is projected for irrigated yields in the 2090 s is the same as what rainfed yields are projected to incur 6 decades earlier in 2030s fig 5 within both rcp scenarios higher maize yield is projected to decrease under rcp 8 5 for all decades except irrigated yields in 2030 s while the difference will vary substantially decadal rainfed maize yields declined in the range of 2 2 0 2 t ha to 17 1 4 t ha and 8 1 0 6 t ha to 21 5 1 7 t ha under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively on the other hand decadal irrigated maize yields decreased in the range of 3 7 0 5 t ha to 6 7 1 0 t ha and 4 3 0 6 t ha to 15 6 2 2 t ha under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively under irrigation the highest yield decline is projected towards the end of the century 2080s and 2090s in both rcp scenarios however the timing of substantial near maximal yield declines is distributed more uniformly across the century almost all decades showed 10 yield declines in at least one emission scenario as described earlier a combination of mechanisms could be responsible for these yield declines that are appropriately accounted for by process based crop models the gcm projections reflect increase in minimum temperatures by 2 13 c rcp 4 5 and 3 16 c rcp 8 5 during the emergence stage may that may result in failure of germination leading to loss in yields the increasingly high mean temperatures compared to baseline period during critical maize growth stages june august in both rcp scenarios can lead to reduction in grain filling period and enhance evaporative losses there are other studies that confirmed the similar findings results obtained in this research martins et al 2019 analyzed the impacts of climate change on maize yield in the brazilian northeast and showed that the climate change will negatively impact maize rainfed agriculture with more drastic yield losses to reach more than 60 under rcp 8 5 in late century 2071 2099 this extreme decline in maize productivity might be attributed to aquacrop model s high sensitivity to precipitation and low sensitivity to temperature relative to other crop models deb et al 2015 analyzed climate change impacts on maize cropping in the hilly terrain of himalayas in india and suggested significant declination in the maize yield ranging from 2 5 to 12 8 relative to baseline yield under future climate yang et al 2017 reported that predicted maize yields exhibited a continuous decrease from 2021 to 2080 with total decline in maize yield ranging from 3 to 10 under rcp 4 5 and 6 17 under rcp 8 5 relative to baseline contrary to our results dubey and sharma 2018 reported that the maize yield is projected to increase in the future 2021 2050 by 7 1 rcp 4 5 and 20 4 rcp 8 5 for the semi arid region in india when compared to the baseline period 1981 2010 likewise a trend of increase in maize yields under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios was also reported by srivastava et al 2018 in ghana they attributed this rise in yield to the increase in atmospheric co2 concentration suggesting that it has the potential to increase crop water productivity by enhancing photosynthesis and reducing leaf level transpiration they also confirmed that irrigation compensates for most of the loss of productivity however yields will still be substantially reduced by the elevated temperatures similarly delusca et al 2016 also justified the increase in maize yield due to elevated carbon dioxide concentrations and reported a 40 increase in maize yield under 550 ppm co2 than the ambient 387 ppm co2 concentration to evaluate the yield advantage associated with irrigated yields relative to rainfed conditions in the future we subtracted rainfed yield from irrigated yield values across the entire projection period for each scenario individually the resulting difference fig 6b was found to show a statistically significant p 0 05 decreasing trend for rcp 8 5 but no trend was detected under rcp 4 5 this is a direct consequence of the decreasing trend found for irrigated yields under both emission scenarios more negative trend under rcp 8 5 than rcp 4 5 while the slope of the rainfed yields was not statistically different from zero this implies that if all the technological and management factors are constant and only weather variability drives productivity the economic advantage associated with the adoption of irrigation will decline under rcp 8 5 this comparative metric of irrigated and rainfed yields has been termed as irrigation limited yield gap by kukal and irmak 2019 and has been quantified historically 1950 2015 across the contiguous u s for nine major irrigated crops they found that historically the gap has been increasing for most crops and regions at a rate of 1 02 kg ha 1 yr 1 implying that adoption of irrigation has been increasingly beneficial over this period integrating our findings with the ones from kukal and irmak 2019 concludes that while this positive historical trend will not continue in the future under rcp 4 5 it will most likely change its direction into a negative trend under rcp 8 5 in addition to the actual magnitudes of irrigated and rainfed yields it is critical to evaluate the projected interannual variability under future emission scenarios this is especially important because technological advances and management driven advances will likely improve maize yields further similar to historical nass yield trajectories in fig 3 and thus the absolute magnitudes of simulated yields should not be solely relied upon these potential improvements are not expected to be captured simulated by crop models and thus model simulations should instead be intended towards investigating year to year variability caused from weather shocks the gcm ensemble mean future yield trajectories fig 4b and 4c make it evident that there exists high interannual variability in future rainfed yields relative to irrigated yields for rcp 4 5 the cv of rainfed yields 0 15 was 873 greater than that of irrigated yields 0 02 similarly for rcp 8 5 the cv of rainfed yields 0 18 was 265 greater than that of irrigated yields 0 05 this comparative irrigated vs rainfed yield interannual variability is also worthwhile to look at during the entire projection period 2020 2099 to this end we computed residuals from a linear trajectory of maize yields presented in fig 6a and applied a modulus function to the residuals which we refer to as yield variability the long term projected mean variability for rainfed and irrigated yield was 0 81 t ha and 0 13 t ha respectively under rcp 4 5 the mean variability was higher under rcp 8 5 at 0 99 t ha and 0 33 t ha for rainfed and irrigated yields respectively thus rainfed yield variability was 533 and 200 greater than irrigated yield variability under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively among all the deviations from the yield trajectories computed for the projection period n 81 negative deviations were encountered 53 under rcp 4 5 and 49 under rcp 8 5 of the time for rainfed yield under rcp 4 5 negative deviations were slightly less frequent for irrigated yield with 47 rate of occurrence under both emission scenarios among the negative deviations the mean residual magnitude in rainfed yields was 0 76 t ha and 1 0 t ha under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively similarly the mean negative residual magnitude in irrigated yields was 0 14 t ha and 0 35 t ha under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively in contrast among the positive deviations the mean residual magnitude in rainfed yields was greater 0 86 t ha under rcp 4 5 and slightly lower 0 98 t ha under rcp 8 5 than its negative counterpart for irrigated yields the mean positive residual magnitudes were lower 0 12 and 0 31 t ha for both emission scenarios than its negative counterpart the absolute residuals were regressed against time and it was found that only irrigated yield variability under rcp 8 5 was shown to have a statistically significant p 0 01 increasing trend in time which was 16 of the mean variability per decade similar to trends in difference among irrigated and rainfed yields discussed earlier we also quantified the difference in yield variability among rainfed and irrigated yields for all growing seasons fig 6c and found that in the future this difference is projected to decrease rate of 11 per decade however only under rcp 8 5 this is a consequence of relative temporal behavior of relative and irrigated yield variabilities under rcp 8 5 irrigated yield variability increased while rainfed yield variability did not show any trend narrowing the difference between them this metric termed as irrigation induced reduction in yield variability iiryv has been quantified and discussed at length by kukal and irmak 2020 for nine major crops in the conus using 220 000 historical records they found that historical records point towards non significant trends since 1947 although the recent past 1980 s shows positive trends in maize iiryv the decreasing trend in fig 6c implies that as climate changes in south central nebraska the yield stabilizing benefit of irrigation relative to rainfed yields will diminish unlike what has been seen historically this effect is more severe when observed in combination with the decreased yield advantage associated with irrigation relative to rainfed conditions fig 6 recent modeling efforts in the ogallala aquifer ecosystems have shown that due to unsustainable pumping in significant irrigated areas transitioning to pasture or dryland production is projected these comparisons of yield advantage and stability will be increasingly important in assessment of dryland maize converted from irrigated maize this transition will more likely happen gradually via dependence on limited irrigation which has been locally found to increase water use efficiency irmak 2015a b the relative magnitudes of yield magnitude and stability under limited irrigation are logically supposed to lie between those of irrigated and rainfed conditions however these are out of the scope of this research 3 5 temperature and precipitation as drivers of irrigated vs maize yields temperatures and precipitation have complex impacts on crop yields along with other critical meteorological variables which can be appropriately only mechanistically represented using crop models in an attempt to decipher the contribution of temperature and precipitation on irrigated vs rainfed maize yields we regressed the change in model simulated maize yields from baseline conditions and change in tmin tmax tavg and precipitation during the growing season from baseline conditions in ordinary least square regression the regression plots are shown in fig 7 impact of air temperature change under rcp 4 5 fig 8 impact of air temperature change under rcp 8 5 and fig 9 impact of precipitation change under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 a negative correlation statistically significant at 95 c i existed between temperature and yield for rainfed and irrigated treatments under both rcps however there exists substantial difference in relative behavior of irrigated and rainfed yield to the same change in air temperatures across all the three metrics of rcp 4 5 air temperatures temperature variability was able to better explain irrigated yield variability than rainfed yield variability fig 7 specifically by 229 difference of r2 under irrigated and rainfed conditions relative to r2 under rainfed conditions 126 and 163 for tmin tmax and tavg however the sensitivity of maize yield to a unit increase in respective metrics of air temperatures was greater in rainfed maize than irrigated maize this difference of sensitivity t ha 1 c 1 among rainfed and irrigated yields was 183 245 and 214 for tmin tmax and tavg respectively while tmax has greater by 6 sensitivity than tmin for rainfed yields tmin was more important by 15 than tmax for irrigated yields which resulted in a lower sensitivity difference among rainfed and irrigated yields for tmin than tmax now a similar assessment for rcp 8 5 fig 8 suggests that the greater increase in air temperatures will manifest as a non linear decrease in irrigated yields while rainfed yields maintained a relatively weaker linear relationship with air temperatures thus if additional warming beyond that projected for rcp 4 5 occurs seasonal tavg 4 c irrigated yields will suffer drastically with a non linear response direct comparisons were not made among irrigated and rainfed sensitivities due to their contrasting response behavior to change in air temperatures again as seen under rcp 4 5 tmax was slightly more important for rainfed yields than tmin while the opposite was true for irrigated yields rainfed yield sensitivity to a unit increase in air temperature can be seemingly interpreted to decrease under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 see a decrease in slope coefficients under rcp 8 5 but such a comparison would be unfair given the vastly different range of air temperatures under the two emission scenarios also as it was observed earlier rainfed yield variability is explained to a higher proportion by precipitation instead of air temperatures this was confirmed quantitatively from fig 9 which shows that precipitation change explained 46 and 50 of the variability observed in rainfed yield change under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 which was 100 and 733 greater than what was explained for irrigated yield variability under these scenarios thus while precipitation change was a reasonable driver for irrigated yields under rcp 4 5 r2 of 0 23 its role was only slightly important under rcp 8 5 similar to the findings of this research araji et al 2018 reported that the final yield under no water stress and with mild water stress were significantly correlated with tmax and tmin while under sever water stress the yield was significantly correlated with precipitation at 95 confidence level in a great plains wide assessment kukal and irmak 2018a found that climate temperature and precipitation explained maize yield variability under rainfed conditions was 436 higher than irrigated crops and that rainfed yield variability was largely explained by both precipitation and temperature whereas temperature alone explained irrigated yield variability they also found that sensitivity of rainfed maize to temperature was twice that of irrigated maize while precipitation sensitivity for rainfed maize was 43 times that of irrigated maize the high tmax are mechanistically responsible for shortening the duration of reproductive development causing yield declines leakey 2009 which has been observed in the us midwest mishra and cherkauer 2010 high tmin however causes increased nighttime respiration consequently negatively affecting the amount of photoassimilates available for plant growth and yield sadok and jagadish 2020 the results of this study should be viewed with adequate understanding of the assumptions and conditions under which these estimates were derived the research presents a future scenario where hybrids and crop and soil management have not adapted to the changed environment most likely these adaptation measures as well as technological advances will continue in the future as they have in the past and produce gains in maize yield potential the linearly increasing trends evident from the historical nass maize yield trajectories fig 3 are a result of development of improved hybrids stress tolerance less reliant on insecticides increased pest and disease resistance higher standability longer maturity duration reduced time input per acre resource capture etc selection of these hybrids kucharik 2008 planting date adaptations kucharik 2006 a more conducive microclimate butler et al 2018 plant growth enhancement due to higher carbon dioxide levels twine et al 2013 precision agriculture advances schimmelpfennig 2016 yost et al 2017 and others these potential adaptations were not included in the modeling exercise and in some cases are challenging to project and model at the same time there is recent evidence to suggest that these adaptation measures have resulted in heightened climate sensitivity in the u s corn belt ortiz bobea et al 2018 lobell et al 2020 thus given uncertain future roadmaps these results should only be viewed as a comparison of how yields under sufficient moisture availability vs precipitation reliant moisture availability will fare in the future under the current management regimes the model also does not consider the potential impacts that will likely result from the ongoing realization of increased environmental impacts of a intensive agricultural system including carbon emissions crippa et al 2021 and water quality impacts kling et al 2014 the relative behavior of irrigated vs rainfed yields projected in this research informs how the limited irrigation water that will be available in the region should be allocated when grain yield is the sole target the producer operations and policy and decision making around the water allocation must consider how grain yields vs availability of irrigation dynamics will evolve in the near and distant future the multi model 18 gcms assessment used in this research prioritize accounting for the uncertainty introduced into the yield projections because of an uncertain climate future to evaluate if the negative impacts on yield can be countered and if so to what extent research should evaluate various adaptive management options in a futuristic and realistic framework 4 conclusions the projected climate conditions simulated from an ensemble of 18 gcms were observed to negatively affect both irrigated and rainfed maize yields in general under rainfed conditions maize yield is projected to decrease in the range of 2 2 17 in rcp 4 5 and from 8 1 to 21 5 in rcp 8 5 scenario on a decadal 10 year average basis for irrigated conditions the yield is expected to decrease from 3 7 to 6 7 in rcp 4 5 and from 4 3 to 15 6 in rcp 8 5 scenario we found that the economic advantage associated with the adoption of irrigation will decline under rcp 8 5 this will be exacerbated by rainfed yields showing more than fivefold and two fold variability than irrigated yields under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively the yield stabilizing benefit of irrigation relative to rainfed yields will diminish as the projected difference among rainfed and irrigated yield variability is projected to decrease rate of 11 per decade under rcp 8 5 temperatures were able to better explain irrigated than rainfed yield variability however the sensitivity of maize yield to air temperature was greater in rainfed than irrigated maize by 183 245 and 214 for tmin tmax and tavg respectively while tmax was more important than tmin for rainfed yields the opposite was true for irrigated yields additional warming in rcp 8 5 beyond that projected under rcp 4 5 is projected to result in non linear decrease in irrigated yields on the other hand precipitation change explained 46 and 50 of the variability observed in rainfed yield change under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 which was 100 and 733 greater than what was explained for irrigated yield variability these analyses can be valuable for policy and decision makers and agricultural and water resources managers professionals to evaluate the future tradeoffs among irrigation and rainfed yields and how landscapes are projected to perform under two scenarios absent

9756,over the past decade there has been an increasing research on the use of machine learning tools for estimating reference crop evapotranspiration eto however due to the data hungry nature of the machine learning models all of these researches are not suitable for regions with limited data supply this study aims to provide a breakthrough for the bottleneck through coupling of the inter model ensemble with various data management schemes the bayesian modeling approach and a non linear neural ensemble based inter model ensemble bma e and nne e were developed locally with data from five different meteorological stations in the peninsular malaysia the nne e was found to be highly robust spatially whereby it can be used to estimate daily eto accurately at other stations even though with reduced input meteorological parameters however the performances of the locally trained models were found wanting and were fluctuating violently this was resolved through creating a data pool that include the data from all stations and developing a universal nne by following the proposed scheme of things the daily eto can be easily estimated across the whole peninsular malaysia this being without the need for historical data and new models at estimation site keywords bayesian modeling approach non linear neural ensemble exogenous data limited data hybrid models 1 introduction the actual evapotranspiration eta represents the total consumptive use of water for crop growth accounting for the evaporation process from the crop and soil surrounding surfaces and the transpiration process through the crop itself apart from its role in the important total water budget the radiation driven et process also affects the energy budget zeng and cai 2018 the crop evapotranspiration et is at times also referred to as the water lost to the atmosphere through the natural evapotranspiration process of the crops under standard and optimum conditions allen et al 1998 therefore accurate prediction of the et is an important factor for the precise administration of water allocation to benefit the agriculture industry the eta can be measured on site using various methods such as the lysimetric measurement bowen ratio energy balance eddy covariance and sap flow however these methods are characterized by several notable flaws for instance the coverage of lysimeters is too small to be considered representative of a large field the bowen ratio energy balance is highly sensitive to the soil water availability while the accuracy of the eddy covariance is highly correlated with the quality of the collected data pereira et al 2015 2021 thus rather than being measured the et is often inferred from various empirical models that uses meteorological or ancillary data to make approximations the united nations food and agriculture organizations have endorsed the penman monteith fao pm equation for estimating the reference crop evapotranspiration eto as stated in their report allen et al 1998 the eto is the hypothesized value of the et for a reference surface not short of water covered with 8 15 cm tall green grass by considering a crop coefficient factor kc which can vary with the crop growth stage the et of a specific crop at a given crop growth stage can be estimated provided an accurate eto is available regardless the calculation of eto from the fao pm equation does require an intensive number of meteorological parameters that are measured accurately these parameters could be unavailable in most under developed regions whereby the setup and maintenance of the data collection infrastructures are burdensome and daunting to say the least this has forced many researchers to look for simpler models which need lesser forcing data such as the hargreaves samani hs equation hargreaves and samani 1985 makkink equation makkink 1957 and romanenko equation romanenko 1961 the need to calibrate these models locally often troubles the researchers whereby the data set has to be large enough to generalize the local parameters djaman et al 2016 feng et al 2017a hadria et al 2021 in fact studies also revealed that the performance of such empirical models are unstable across different regions trajkovic et al 2019 this means that while the simple empirical models are able to curb the need of diverse meteorological parameter but however they are still vulnerable when historical data are insufficient to determine the localized parameters mandatory for use in the equations during the pacey improvement of information technology and soft computing methods in the past two decades the researchers have steered their attention to address the issues faced by the empirical models through the use of the machine learning approach this paradigmatic shift has resulted in the massive amount of published works related to the machine learning based estimation of et and its related metrics recently chia et al 2020b the architectures of the proposed machine learning models evolved from basic artificial neural network ann support vector machine svm tree based models chia et al 2020a kisi and kilic 2015 kumar et al 2002 through to the different possible variants of hybrid models for instance chia et al 2021b integrated swarm based optimization algorithms on the extreme learning machine elm to assist in the tuning of the model s hyper parameters for better eto estimation various optimization algorithms had also been integrated into ann and svm for the estimation of monthly eto tikhamarine et al 2019 2020 kisi et al 2021 improve the m5 model tree by including a kernel transformation using the radial basis function rbf taking it further nourani et al 2020 and granata and di nunno 2021 independently adopted a multi model approach where the eto and eta were estimated respectively with different models were then averaged out to obtain a more accurate approximation from the results of these publications machine learning has proved itself to be a promising solution for eto estimation with the common meteorological data despite the efforts of many researchers in improving the performance of machine learning models the data hungry nature of the machine learning models has to be tackled immediately being a data driven entity a machine learning model can only perform efficiently when it is trained with sufficient amounts of data or examples jing et al 2019 on the other hand the types and varieties of data fed into the model are also vital in determining the performance of the model essential information such as the temperature and the solar radiation have to be included in the training data to ensure the model is able to extract useful messages in order to produce reliable eto estimation chen et al 2020b zhu et al 2020 similar to the hs equation the makkink equation and the romanenko equation most trained machine learning models are found to be only effective locally at the trained region albeit the latter with significant superiority in many instances chen et al 2020b this results in the situation where machine learning models have to be retrained again with local data in order to be useful the data hunger of machine learning models can be classified into qualitative hunger and quantitative hunger as shown in fig 1 there are research works available in the literature that attempted to solve this problem through various data management strategies to overcome the qualitative hunger different approaches had been adopted to determine the optimum input combination to the machine learning models for example chen et al 2020a demonstrated the possibility of reducing inputs for deep learning models using the principle component analysis pca and the maximal information coefficient mic feng et al 2017b on the other hand forced their models to accept only temperature data and proved that the elm and generalized regression neural network grnn performed better than the empirical models bellido jiménez et al 2021 used different types of features that can be measured easily such as the interval between maximum temperature time and sunset time as well as the integral of half hourly temperature in a day to estimate eto in humid regions as for the quantitative hunger different data management schemes were tested to reduce the need of locally collected data the state of the art include the work of kiafar et al 2016 where they had used cross station train and test method two pairs of station to evaluate the robustness of the gene expression programming gep model however it was found that the performance of the gep model was unstable and could not reach to a firm conclusion fan et al 2019 performed similar study using the light gradient boosting machine lgbm and the estimation of eto was found to be more promising as compared to the empirical and other machine learning models yan et al 2021 also reported their results by using the extreme gradient machine hybridized with whale optimization algorithm woa xgb shiri et al 2019 on the other hand had proposed seven data splitting strategies which included combinations of data from different stations and periods as well as addition of ancillary data considering the fact that only either temperature or radiation data was used to train their gep models the authors managed to reduce the qualitative hunger of the gep model the results revealed that the gep models trained and tested locally achieved the best accuracy and the performance can be boosted with the inclusion of ancillary data pattern of eto in this case from other external stations however the addition of ancillary data would actually increase the qualitative hunger of the gep models when the models were used at external stations the performance deteriorated significantly where the accuracy and generalizability could decline by more than 50 however the authors demonstrated that this decline can be mitigated by incorporating some external data into the training dataset shiri et al 2013 showed for the first time that a generalized anfis models performed better when trained using global data pool from different climate regions cross climatic eto estimation exhibited a significant drop in performance another study was conducted by wu et al 2019 to compare the performance of eight machine learning models in estimating eto with reduced data points in the study the authors pooled data from all stations into a global data pool for model training the resultant model was then tested at stations where their data were not included in the global data pool it was discovered that the svm managed to be one of the top ranked machine learning models consistently for all the cases tested subsequently the authors also applied the models to estimate eto with synthetic data produced through combining temperature and radiation data from different stations the svm was still the most consistent model for this part of experiment a more recent study conducted by kazemi et al 2021 extended the cross station validation using data from different countries the gep models were trained in turkey and applied in iran however the results were less promising with registered relative error that ranged between 15 and 28 the available literatures that demonstrate the importance of data management strategy to overcome the data hunger of machine learning models are still limited in the context of geographical location models used as well as the approaches adopted it is imperative to explore for more robust machine learning models and also evaluate for different ways to solve the problem models hunger for data in recent years a decision by committee approach has been widely applied in order to produce estimation with greater accuracy the inter model ensemble can be formed following various methods including through simple averaging bayesian modeling non linear neural ensemble nne and others chia et al 2021a granata and di nunno 2021 hao et al 2019 nourani et al 2019 therefore the main objective of this study is to assess the geographical robustness of various inter model ensembles in estimating daily eto besides the optimum input combinations of various meteorological parameters are also reported in the results of this study this work aims to 1 develop inter model ensembles that consist of an artificial neural network ann support vector regressor svr as well as the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis via bayesian modeling approach bma and the non linear neural ensemble nne 2 train inter model ensembles at different meteorological stations with differential geographical characteristics in the peninsular malaysia 3 determine the effect of the geographical characteristics on the performance of inter model ensembles 4 examine the effect of data management strategies applied to solve the data hungry issue both qualitative and quantitative of inter model ensembles the scope of this work is undoubtedly novel as no research has been published that explores the robustness of committee based inter model ensemble as a strategy to resolve their data hungry nature there is yet any other publication that reveal the abilities of inter model ensembles based on the bma and the nne in solving the aforementioned issue faced by the machine learning models let alone in a region with a typical tropical rainforest climate the success of this study could contribute to the estimation of daily eto in the peninsular malaysia with minimal amount of data qualitatively and quantitatively this would in turn minimize the dependency on local data collection and at the same time reduce the number of sensors or instruments needed for eto estimation purpose from a different perspective a massive amount of historical data is not essential for the purpose of developing models only for local use that has limited usage in this work the essential parameter was the solar radiation rs which can be easily computed through the location of the stations as well as the date of interest hence successful deployment of the models developed in this work could potentially eliminate the use or need of any data collection instruments the output of this research work would be even more valuable as it would be performed in the peninsular malaysia where its economy is mainly sustainably driven by agricultural commodities such as oil palm and rubber the ann svr and anfis models were selected as the base models because these three models represent the simplest form of machine learning models available for selection meanwhile the decision tree model another simple model was disregarded due to its binary nature that would be more useful for classification task instead of the regression duty required for this study the selection of the simplest machine learning models was justified by the need for computationally efficient models minimalistic approach instead of complex and sophisticated models that are widely developed nowadays the adaptation of the minimalistic approach is being regarded as one of the novelties of this study meanwhile the bma and nne were adopted as the hybridization approaches as they each represents the ensemble based on statistical modeling and black box operation respectively the comparison of the capabilities of different ensembles in terms of spatial robustness to overcome the data hunger of machine learning models are of interest in this current work which were not previously reported in the literature 2 methods 2 1 study location and data this research work was carried out in peninsular malaysia which is at proximity to the earth s equator this region has an area of 132 265 km2 approximately according to the köppen climate classification the region has a tropical rainforest climate which does not have any distinct dry season this in turn allows high output of agricultural product as there is no significant growth downtime the latest statistics published by the malaysian government shows that the agricultural sector is the third largest contributor to the nation s gross domestic production gdp hence the study of et and eto which represent the water loss from soil surface as well as water consumed to enable plant growth is important in this region five meteorological stations with different geographical characteristics were included in this study namely station 48620 sitiawan station 48623 lubok merbau station 48632 cameron highlands station 48647 subang and station 48649 muadzam shah the positions of these stations are pinned on a map illustrated in fig 2 the details as well as the geographical characteristics of the five meteorological stations under investigation are compiled in table 1 the number of stations included in this study was deemed adequate by referring to the area to station ratio of several previous studies mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 tao et al 2018 daily meteorological data were sourced from the jabatan meteorologi malaysia the malaysian meteorology department mmd the data provided by the mmd dated from the year 2000 2019 7305 days data points the information contained in the dataset included the maximum minimum and mean temperature tmax tmin tmean mean relative humidity rh mean wind speed u measured at 10 m from the ground ibrahim et al 2014 as well as solar radiation rs the parameters had been measured and collected at the elevations of the respective meteorological stations as stated in table 1 2 2 penman monteith equation the penman monteith pm equation was used to calculate the values of eto for different data points the calculated eto from the pm equation were treated as training data or examples to be shown to the machine learning models during the supervised learning process at the same time some of the eto computed from the pm equation were used to evaluate the accuracy of the developed inter model ensemble the pm equation is shown in eq 1 1 et o 0 408 r n g γ 900 t mean 272 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn net radiation mjm 2day 1 g soil heat flux mjm 2day 1 u2 wind speed at 2 m altitude m s es mean saturation vapor pressure kpa ea actual vapor pressure kpa slope of vapor pressure curve kpa c γ psychrometric constant kpa c data utilized for the daily eto calculation using the pm equation were corrected and adjusted to standard values as suggested in compliance to the crop evapotranspiration guidelines for computing crop water requirements fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 allen et al 1998 so that the resultant eto resembled the reference site conditions under standard and optimum conditions however for the development of the machine learning models sections 2 3 2 4 and 2 5 raw data were used to reduce the complexity in estimating daily eto specifically the machine learning models were trained to estimate standard eto using the normalized raw data 2 3 base models 2 3 1 artificial neural network inspired by the way the neurons in human brain transmit signals the artificial neural network ann that consists of an input layer an output layer and numerous hidden layers was introduced the input layer acts as the receptor whereas the output layer is the corresponding reflector the hidden layers between the input and output layers transmit information in the form of signal through the hidden neurons weights and biases analogous to cell body and axon of a biological neuron cell generally the mathematical representation of an ann can be written in the form as shown in eq 2 2 y f 1 n w i x i b where y output vector x input vector w weight b bias term it is important to note that in order to simplify the base ann model the authors of this study adopted a general design that follows the following rules a the ann models have only one hidden layer b the number of hidden neurons was decided based on n 1 where n is the number of input meteorological parameters c sigmoid activation function was used these general rules can be obtained from a series of trial and error that could optimize the modeling simplicity as well as accuracy of models abrishami et al 2018 2 3 2 support vector regressor the support vector machine svr is a kernel based machine learning model that generalize the regression based on the distribution of the transformed data in the feature space vapnik 1995 by using a kernel function the inputs are processed and a regression analysis will be done to fit the data using a hyperplane in this study the kernel function selected was the gaussian function also known as rbf function the selection of the rbf kernel function was justified as seen in several published works fan et al 2018 ferreira et al 2019 the computations involved in the learning and estimation of svr are shown in eq 3 to eq 6 3 y w φ x b where y output vector x input vector w weight vector φ selected kernel function b bias term the transformation of data into a feature space using gaussian kernel function is as following 4 k x n x i exp γ x n x i 2 c where x element of the input vector γ c hyperparameters during the training stage the w and b is optimized by finding the minimum value of the loss function r 5 r 0 5 w 2 c 1 n i 1 n l ε y m y o 6 l ε y m y o 0 i f y m y o ε y m y o ε o t h e r w i s e where 0 5 w 2 regularization term lε ε insensitive error function ε optimum distance between svr hyperplane and the support vectors ym model s prediction yo observed value 2 3 3 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis is a more linguistic machine learning models that allows the prediction or estimation to be done based on the likeliness the estimation of the anfis model is done by the membership functions as well as the fuzzy rules which are tuned and optimized using the ann model most literatures preferred sugeno type fuzzy rules over the mamdani type roy et al 2021 tao et al 2018 2 4 inter model ensembles an inter model ensemble involves more than one machine learning model in the process of estimation to be precise the ensemble will aggregate the estimations of individual machine learning models through a predefined method this method can be simple averaging or weighted averaging with different priorities in this study the author selected two hybridization methods namely the bayesian modeling approach bma as well as the nne using a stochastic enabled elm model 2 4 1 bayesian modeling approach there are two variations of bayesian modeling approach bma the bayesian model averaging and the bayesian model selection the two approaches share the same fundamental whereby the individual models assessed will be given a degree of truthfulness the degree of truthfulness can be imputed from the calculation of the posterior probabilities of the models estimations as shown in eq 7 7 p m i y p y m i p m i j n p y m j p m j where p mi y posterior model probability p mi prior model probability p y mi marginal likelihood n number of models considered the posterior model probability for each model obtained from eq 7 can be used to calculate the weightage of the individual models within the ensemble and subsequently the final estimation as portrayed in eq 8 and eq 9 8 w i p m i y i 1 n p m i y 9 y i 1 n w i y i where wi weightage of the ith model y vector of ensemble s estimation y i estimation vector of the ith model if one of the models gets a weightage of 1 it means that the model beats its rivals entirely and will be selected as the best model for simplicity the inter model ensembles developed through bma in this study are addressed as bma e 2 4 2 stochastic enabled extreme learning machine creating an inter model ensemble using the nne approach involves the aggregation of the estimations from individual models through a black box operation for this to be done there are numerous ways that can be thought of in this study the authors chose to perform such aggregation by using the stochastic enabled elm the elm model is one variation of the ann family that consists of only one hidden layer with randomly generated hyper parameters the elm model can be expressed mathematically in eq 10 and eq 11 10 f x i 1 l h i β i 11 h β t where l number of hidden neurons hi output of the ith neuron βi weight of the ith neuron h vector for the outputs of the hidden neurons β vector for the neurons weights t target vector due to its simple and light design the elm model has high computational speed but at the same time lacks the fine tune process to curb this problem an optimization algorithm is integrated to enable the process of stochastic tuning in order to explore for the optimum hyper parameters of the elm model the whale optimization algorithm woa was selected for such purpose the woa resembles the preying nature of a herd of whales that involves exploration and exploitation mirjalili and lewis 2016 the overall algorithms can be represented from equation 12

input the normalization is done in accordance with eq 17 17 x norm x x min x max x min where x norm normalized vector of input vector x x input vector xmax maximum value in the vector x xmin minimum value in the vector x on top of that the authors investigated the best input combinations of meteorological parameters at different stations hence all the six meteorological parameters were shuffled and combined in different ways to produce a total of 63 input combinations to be studied the initial screening would help to select the best input combination with different number of parameters to be used in subsequent study all the possible input combinations are shown in fig 3 moreover during each training session the k fold cross validation set k to 10 was used in order to prevent possible overfitting of the machine learning models in this study the conventional k 10 was used fushiki 2009 granata 2019 jung et al 2020 this means that 90 of the data approximately 6575 data points would be used for training purpose while the remaining would be used as test data for each fold the results of each fold were averaged 2 6 performance evaluation to evaluate the performance of the inter model ensembles trained with either local or exogenous data several metrics were used the mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse assess the performances of the ensembles in terms of accuracy whereby rmse can detect large errors more effectively the mean bias error mbe and coefficient of determination r2 on the other hand were used to evaluate the generalizability of the ensembles for the error metrics mae rmse and mbe the closer they approach the zero value it means that the models are more accurate as for the r2 the value of 1 represents perfect fitting the mae rmse r2 and mbe are illustrated as in eq 18 to eq 21 respectively 18 mae mm day 1 n i 1 n y m i y o i 19 rmse mm day 1 n i 1 n y m i y o i 2 20 mbe 1 n i 1 n y m i y o i 21 r 2 i n y o i y o y m i y m i n y o i y

performance indicator gpi which combines multiple metrics was used despotovic et al 2015 the gpi score is positive oriented and a better model should achieve higher gpi score the gpi score can be calculated as shown in eq 22 22 gpi j 1 n α j y j y ij where y median of the scaled values of individual metrics yij scaled value jth metric for model i αi 1 for all metrics except for the r2 1 2 7 overall work flow in scheme 1 the inter model ensembles were developed locally using data at each station only the case of station 48620 sitiawan is used herein as an example for explanation purposes the ann svr and anfis models were trained at station 48620 sitiawan using its local data by considering all the 63 possible input combinations then six best input combinations consisting of one to six meteorological parameters were selected through bayesian screening and would be used for subsequent investigation the three based models were aggregated by with the bma as well as the nne to create two local inter model ensembles bma e and nne e the bma e and nne e were used to estimate eto in exogenous stations and tested for their performance in other words from the perspective of the other stations the bma e and nne e trained in station 48620 sitiawan were foreign models trained with exogenous data that can be used directly and did not require any of them to provide any historical data examples similar steps were done for the data at other stations meanwhile in scheme 2 another universal inter model ensemble was created using pooled data from all the stations this inter model ensemble was solely based on nne as it was impossible to tell the weightage of the base models all the modeling works were performed using the matlab r2016a platform the overall workflow of this work is illustrated in detail by fig 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 screening of best input combinations the ann svr and anfis models were trained and tested locally at all the stations investigated using different input combinations the accuracy and goodness of fit indicators for the ann svr and anfis models at all of the stations are plotted in heat maps as shown in fig 5 fig 6 and fig 7 respectively the exact values of the performance evaluation metrics can be found in the excel spreadsheet provided as the supplementary data the values of the metrics are represented by color scale in fig 5 fig 6 and fig 7 the closer the color is to clarity the better is the model performance hence one can easily distinguish the performances of the ann svr and anfis models at the stations using different input combinations at a single glance by comparing the three base models it can be seen that the ann model excelled in reducing the mae and rmse thus producing daily eto estimation with higher accuracy on the other hand the anfis model had better generalizability where the lower mbe was achieved the range of mbe incurred by the anfis model was between 0 001 mm day and 0 001 mm day which was lower than that of the ann between 0 01 mm day and 0 01 mm day as well as svr 0 1 mm day and 0 1 mm day models the svr model however produced the poorest performance nevertheless at this stage it is clear that models had their own strengths and weaknesses the ann model outperformed the svr and anfis models in terms of accuracy mae and rmse whereas the anfis had the best performance in terms of mbe at most of the stations the svr model performed less satisfactory than the ann and anfis models probably due to the rigidity of the svr architecture as compared to the other two base models that causes it to fail in handling highly non linear and fluctuating data michele et al 2019 by combining them to form an inter model ensemble it is expected that the models would complement each other in a positive manner by performing the bayesian screening the best input combinations from one to six input meteorological parameters were determined for each station the screening was done by going through the results presented in fig 5 fig 6 and fig 7 considering the performance of the ann svr and anfis models when different combinations were used as input in fact those input combinations that produced dark bands tiles in fig 5 fig 6 and fig 7 could be eliminated easily the results are summarized in fig 8 at all the stations it was decided to use the same group input combinations for one three five and six meteorological parameters b1 b3 b5 and b6 respectively however for the four meteorological parameters case the two stations that were covered with thick vegetation namely station 48623 lubok merbau and station 48629 it was preferred to have rh removed from the b5 group which was different from other stations that had tmin removed from b5 nevertheless both alternatives still came to the same combination for three input meteorological parameters this means that the priorities of rh and tmin were different for the two parties similarly for the two input parameters category only station 48632 cameron highlands which is located at a significantly higher altitude was chosen to have u removed instead of tmax from b3 the best input combinations at each station would be treated as permanent local properties that is to say during the development of the inter model ensembles the best input combinations would be used at the same time when a local model at one station was used to estimate the eto at another station it would require that the input meteorological parameters be based on the local best input combinations from fig 8 it can be seen that the rs was being regarded as the most important input parameter at all of the meteorological stations this was in agreement with many previous studies in region with similar climatic pattern ndiaye et al 2017 odongo et al 2019 on the other hand the tmean which had lower fluctuation and much of its characteristics covered in tmax and tmin was the least powerful driving factor for the eto estimation in the peninsular malaysia 3 2 development of inter model ensemble the inter model ensembles were developed locally at each station via the bma as well as the nne based on the stochastic enabled elm the bayesian weightage of the ann svr and anfis models at different stations were calculated based on the posterior probabilities and are tabulated as shown in table 2 it can be seen that except for station 48620 sitiawan the svr model was given the lowest weightage in the bma e this could be due to the fact that the svr model being the weakest model of all three did not have any outstanding traits in fact when the input meteorological parameters are sufficient at least three most stations would give higher weightage to the ann model in those cases the weightage of the ann model was 1 or very close to 1 which meant that the bma algorithm was switched to the bayesian model selection and considered only the ann in the bma e this was attributed to the unsurmountable superiority of the ann model when the input meteorological parameters were sufficient as shown by the results from the previous section however when the number of input meteorological parameters became lesser only one or two inputs the bayesian weightage awarded to the anfis model increased drastically this indicated that the anfis model had the ability to complement the ann model that had deteriorated accuracy when estimating eto with lesser input meteorological parameters similar findings were reported by kim et al 2016 whereby the bma ensemble would perform better if more models were incorporated into the ensemble on the other hand the nne e which followed a black box operation manner did not disclose any the weightage given to the participating base models chakraborty et al 2021 the inter model ensembles were built in such a way that the authors could only managed to examine the final product of the eto estimation 3 3 local performance of inter model ensembles in order to prove the efficacy and practicability of the developed inter model ensembles for robust usage the inter model ensembles would have to outperform the base models first nevertheless it is impractical to compare the evaluation metrics one by one which may contradict with each other therefore the gpi was used as the universal measurement of the performance of the base models as well as the inter model ensembles as shown in table 3 the accuracy and goodness of fit indicators of the base models and inter model ensembles can be found in the spreadsheet provided as supplementary data as shown in table 3 the inter model ensembles regardless of the bma e or the nne e model had the ability to outperform the based models this is especially obvious at station 48620 sitiawan and at station 48632 cameron highlands where the nne e models achieved the highest gpi score for all input combinations at the respective stations as mentioned earlier the nne e model worked on the basis of black box operation however it is believed that the exceptional performance of the nne e model at the two aforementioned stations could be due to two possible reasons firstly the nne e model had larger room for improvement at station 48620 sitiawan and station 48632 cameron highlands this was due to the fact that the mae as well as the rmse recorded at the two stations relative to the average eto were high as compared to other stations the nne e model was permitted to have a second look at the target value for further adjustment of the model s hyper parameters to enhance its accuracy furthermore the geographical locations of station 48620 sitiawan and station 48632 cameron highlands exhibited geographical extremes in terms of the elevation from the sea level the substantial effect of elevation on model performance had been confirmed in a study by xu et al 2018 for instance the modis models had lower accuracy at stations that were located higher elevations thus these factors offered additional conducive conditions for the nne e model to operate in turn achieving outstanding performance nonetheless the inter model ensemble including the bma e did improve from the benchmark performance of the base models there were some other cases where the ann model and the bma e had the same gpi score this happened when the bma algorithm was switched to the bayesian model selection mode and determined that ann was the best model among the base models in general for all the 30 test cases evenly distributed over five different stations the nne e was regarded as the best model for 21 times 70 while the bma e only had such achievement for two times 6 67 nevertheless the bma e managed to select the ann model as the best model six times 20 and failed to do so for one of the instances 3 33 at this stage the authors actually are able to tell that the nne e is the best inter model ensemble for estimating eto at all of the meteorological stations investigated the bma algorithm was proven to be feasible in improving the precipitate forecast accuracy over the south korea which is another peninsula in east asia jo et al 2012 meanwhile it was reported in another literature that the bma algorithm alone would not improve the estimation if its constituents within the ensemble performed poorly kim and suh 2013 in other words the potential and performance of the bma e model would be limited by the performance of the base models this property of the bma e model was again demonstrated in the results of this study whereby the performance of the bma e model was found to be unable to surpass that of the base models by a significant margin on the other hand the success of the nne e models to outperform the other base models and inter model ensembles was attributed to the way the development of the nne e model followed when the ann svr and anfis models were combined using the nne approach the algorithm actually had the opportunity to look at the target value for the second time chia et al 2021a this had allowed the internal structure of the woa elm meta learner to tune its internal parameter so that the accuracy and generalizability could be maximized the results of this study had a high level of agreement with the findings reported elsewhere for instance jang and oliveto 2021 used the ann as a meta learner to combine several regional climate models for the precipitate projections in the south korea it was found that the inclusion of suitable models into the ensemble would enhance the projection accuracy similar findings were also reported when such framework was used for streamflow prediction lee and ahn 2021 overall the utilization of a meta learner in nne modeling had shown promising efficiency in the improvement of estimation and prediction 3 4 testing with exogenous and pooled data the best models and input combinations at each of the meteorological stations investigated were tested at other stations at the same time the authors created a pool which consist of the entire data points from all of the stations except for the testing station the inter model ensembles or base models involved in the spatial robustness assessment are compiled in table 4 the results of the eto estimation at different stations using exogenous models were compared using the heat maps fig 9 to fig 14 show the comparison between the eto estimation using exogenous models inter model ensembles or base models and that of the local model with b6 b5 b4a b4b b3 b2a b2b and b1 respectively the actual value of the performance evaluation metrics can be retrieved from the supplementary data fig 9 to fig 14 can be analysed row by row as well as column by column if the heat maps are read diagonally the readers will be able to see the performance of the trained models when they were used locally when analysed row by row it can be seen that the models trained at station 48647 subang had the darkest tone for b6 to b4a b4b by referring to table 3 and table 4 it can be seen that the bma e were the best model for station 48647 subang for the input combinations mentioned in fact all the bma e at station 48647 subang selected ann as the best model of the station this observation can be used to infer that the ann itself is not a spatially robust model to be used exogenously for the eto estimation at other stations the hyperparameters of the ann models were highly region specific as in the case of empirical models which hampered its ability to be applied externally ferreira et al 2019 furthermore the models trained at station 48649 muadzam shah had the poorest performance for the input combinations b3 and b2a b2b fig 12 and fig 13 coincidently the selected models for these two input combinations were also built using the bma it is worth mentioning that for combination b3 the bma e developed also consisted of only the ann model which was similar to those of station 48647 subang that had the worst performance earlier on however for the combination b2a b2b the bma e at station 48649 muadzam shah was developed from the ann and anfis models due to this reason it is observable from fig 13 that the performance of the model trained at station 48649 muadzam shah did not lag behind other exogenous models by a lot except for the higher mbe values as for the input combination b1 model trained at station 48623 lubok merbau had the worst performance this result meets the expectation as the best model selected for this combination was the base ann models for the said station when fig 9 to fig 14 are analysed in a column by column manner the readers can determine which stations had the eto that can be easily interpreted from the heat maps the column of station 48632 cameron highlands consistently had the darkest tone it means that exogenous models were unable to estimate the eto at station 48632 cameron highlands accurately as a decision maker station 46832 cameron highlands should be selected as one of the stations to collect data if possible instead of using exogenous model from other stations on the contrary station 48649 muadzam shah had the eto that can be estimated very accurately by the other exogenous stations hence this station can be exempted for the data collection process from this analysis it can be deduced that the ann or bma e based on ann model is not suitable for exogenous application the results clearly showed that in order to have high spatial robustness the nne e have to be developed from the ann svr and anfis models through the black box operation the nne e is tuned such that it has better accuracy as well as generalizability overall the application of exogenous models to estimate eto is a feasible solution to solve the data hungry nature of machine learning models this can be justified by the low maximum mae and rmse incurred by the models 0 4602 mm day and 0 5579 mm day respectively when b2a b2b was used as well as the high r2 achieved generally above 0 9 despite the fact that the nne e model can be applied for wider spatial application it is undeniable that the performance of exogenous model could not surpass the performance of the local model which is reasonable similar findings were reported by yan et al 2021 however the closer the exogenous models get to the local model the better they are from fig 9 to fig 14 there is no station at which a model can be produced which perform consistently well at all the stations the best exogenous models based on the gpi scoring system using different input combinations are summarized in table 5 for input combinations with more meteorological parameters the best exogenous models are normally the nne e this is because the bma e would prefer the base ann model at this stage and hence the inter model ensemble cannot be formed to improvise the eto estimation however as the number of meteorological parameters decreased to three or two the bma e which had more than one base model constituents would begin to perform better one important phenomenon that has to be mentioned is that the performance ranking of the inter model ensembles were independent of the geographical characteristics of the stations the ensemble approaches were able to consider the difference in the geographical characteristics through repeated training nonetheless it can be witnessed that the best exogenous models were not consistently from one of the stations and it can be difficult to select which station to set up the data collection infrastructure lu et al 2018 reported that exogenous models were only recommended had the stations being less than 100 km apart in other words models trained using local data exhibited relatively weak spatial robustness in this study the weakness of the models when being applied externally had been greatly reduced as a result of hybridization however in the case of extreme difference in the weather conditions such as at station 48632 cameron highlands the exogenous models still could not estimate the eto accurately therefore the pooled data can be used as a stabilizer to maintain the performance of model trained using the exogenous data from the results it is desirable to put all the available data in a data pool and use the pooled data for exogenous model development scheme 2 instead of solely depending on either one local station scheme 1 fig 9 to fig 14 reveal that the exogenous models trained using pooled data exhibited smaller fluctuations in their performance as compared to the models trained locally and at each of the stations the results of this study were in agreement with other researches carried out at different regions it was found previously that the use of data from the majority stations to forecast eto at the minority stations had comparable performance with the local test case ferreira and da cunha 2020 although longer time lags were needed to convey a larger amount of information the reason behind the superiority of the models trained with global data pool was that it was made up of dataset with greater variation in other words it considers more distinctive cases which can be inclusive of any other undiscovered regions despite the fact that models trained with the global data pool were still unable to estimate with the best accuracy the daily eto at station 48632 cameron highlands the data of this station was not included in the data pool their performance were considered consistent under the different scenarios it was believed the performance of the models trained with global data pool can be further improved with the inclusion of more data from different meteorological stations in fact an apple to apple comparison can be made between the models developed in this study with empirical models investigated in the work by chia et al 2020a in that particular investigation the hs makkink and romanenko equations were used to estimate the eto of station 48620 sitiawan the minimum mae rmse and mbe reported were 0 444 mm day 0 543 mm day and 0 0207 and were much higher than those reported in this study even if b1 only rs was used as the input parameter was used as the input combination for woa elm e model 0 1142 mm day 0 1454 mm day and 0 0000 respectively this represents improvements in mae rmse and mbe of 74 3 73 2 and 100 respectively it is worth to mention that the hs makkink and romanenko equations used in the cited study had been well calibrated yet unable achieve the accuracy of the exogenous models in this study this means that the developed woa elm e model had better performance and generalizability than the empirical models it can be well hypothesized that similar findings could be achieved in other stations 4 conclusion the eto estimation based on the machine learning models often runs into the bottleneck of limited data supply the data hungry nature of the machine learning models can be expressed qualitatively and quantitatively this research work presents a novel approach to solve the aforementioned problem inter model ensembles based on the bma and the nne using stochastic enabled elm were trained using local data it was found that local applications of such inter model ensembles could improvise the accuracy of the eto estimation the inter model ensembles were then tested in other stations to assess their spatial robustness using the best input combinations by assuming local data were missing at the test stations it was found that the nne e models had sufficiently good spatial robustness where the estimations of eto in other stations were of high accuracies on the other hand the bma e could only perform well when it was constituted of more than one base models however the performances of the bma e and nne e trained using the data of only one station were volatile the utilization of the global data pool was able to solve this problem by training the inter model ensembles using data from more than one stations it was found that the performances of the inter model ensembles were independent of the geographical characteristics it is believed that this difference was considered by the black box operation of the machine learning models through repeated training the outcome of this work shows that it is possible to develop a universal model for the estimation of eto across the peninsular malaysia without the need for historical data to develop a local model a robust machine learning model based on the nne trained using a global data pool that had its geographical robustness proven can be the solution to resolve the data hungry nature of the classical machine learning models this can be a huge contribution to aid the national level decision making when the water resources management is highly dependent on the projected et and eto however the resolution and granularity of this study still can be improved if data from other stations are made available inevitably the performance of the nne e models still needs to be verified at other regions therefore the authors of this article sincerely invite researchers to collaborate through the sharing of local data from their origins as this will be very useful to confirm the spatial robustness of the inter model ensemble

9756,over the past decade there has been an increasing research on the use of machine learning tools for estimating reference crop evapotranspiration eto however due to the data hungry nature of the machine learning models all of these researches are not suitable for regions with limited data supply this study aims to provide a breakthrough for the bottleneck through coupling of the inter model ensemble with various data management schemes the bayesian modeling approach and a non linear neural ensemble based inter model ensemble bma e and nne e were developed locally with data from five different meteorological stations in the peninsular malaysia the nne e was found to be highly robust spatially whereby it can be used to estimate daily eto accurately at other stations even though with reduced input meteorological parameters however the performances of the locally trained models were found wanting and were fluctuating violently this was resolved through creating a data pool that include the data from all stations and developing a universal nne by following the proposed scheme of things the daily eto can be easily estimated across the whole peninsular malaysia this being without the need for historical data and new models at estimation site keywords bayesian modeling approach non linear neural ensemble exogenous data limited data hybrid models 1 introduction the actual evapotranspiration eta represents the total consumptive use of water for crop growth accounting for the evaporation process from the crop and soil surrounding surfaces and the transpiration process through the crop itself apart from its role in the important total water budget the radiation driven et process also affects the energy budget zeng and cai 2018 the crop evapotranspiration et is at times also referred to as the water lost to the atmosphere through the natural evapotranspiration process of the crops under standard and optimum conditions allen et al 1998 therefore accurate prediction of the et is an important factor for the precise administration of water allocation to benefit the agriculture industry the eta can be measured on site using various methods such as the lysimetric measurement bowen ratio energy balance eddy covariance and sap flow however these methods are characterized by several notable flaws for instance the coverage of lysimeters is too small to be considered representative of a large field the bowen ratio energy balance is highly sensitive to the soil water availability while the accuracy of the eddy covariance is highly correlated with the quality of the collected data pereira et al 2015 2021 thus rather than being measured the et is often inferred from various empirical models that uses meteorological or ancillary data to make approximations the united nations food and agriculture organizations have endorsed the penman monteith fao pm equation for estimating the reference crop evapotranspiration eto as stated in their report allen et al 1998 the eto is the hypothesized value of the et for a reference surface not short of water covered with 8 15 cm tall green grass by considering a crop coefficient factor kc which can vary with the crop growth stage the et of a specific crop at a given crop growth stage can be estimated provided an accurate eto is available regardless the calculation of eto from the fao pm equation does require an intensive number of meteorological parameters that are measured accurately these parameters could be unavailable in most under developed regions whereby the setup and maintenance of the data collection infrastructures are burdensome and daunting to say the least this has forced many researchers to look for simpler models which need lesser forcing data such as the hargreaves samani hs equation hargreaves and samani 1985 makkink equation makkink 1957 and romanenko equation romanenko 1961 the need to calibrate these models locally often troubles the researchers whereby the data set has to be large enough to generalize the local parameters djaman et al 2016 feng et al 2017a hadria et al 2021 in fact studies also revealed that the performance of such empirical models are unstable across different regions trajkovic et al 2019 this means that while the simple empirical models are able to curb the need of diverse meteorological parameter but however they are still vulnerable when historical data are insufficient to determine the localized parameters mandatory for use in the equations during the pacey improvement of information technology and soft computing methods in the past two decades the researchers have steered their attention to address the issues faced by the empirical models through the use of the machine learning approach this paradigmatic shift has resulted in the massive amount of published works related to the machine learning based estimation of et and its related metrics recently chia et al 2020b the architectures of the proposed machine learning models evolved from basic artificial neural network ann support vector machine svm tree based models chia et al 2020a kisi and kilic 2015 kumar et al 2002 through to the different possible variants of hybrid models for instance chia et al 2021b integrated swarm based optimization algorithms on the extreme learning machine elm to assist in the tuning of the model s hyper parameters for better eto estimation various optimization algorithms had also been integrated into ann and svm for the estimation of monthly eto tikhamarine et al 2019 2020 kisi et al 2021 improve the m5 model tree by including a kernel transformation using the radial basis function rbf taking it further nourani et al 2020 and granata and di nunno 2021 independently adopted a multi model approach where the eto and eta were estimated respectively with different models were then averaged out to obtain a more accurate approximation from the results of these publications machine learning has proved itself to be a promising solution for eto estimation with the common meteorological data despite the efforts of many researchers in improving the performance of machine learning models the data hungry nature of the machine learning models has to be tackled immediately being a data driven entity a machine learning model can only perform efficiently when it is trained with sufficient amounts of data or examples jing et al 2019 on the other hand the types and varieties of data fed into the model are also vital in determining the performance of the model essential information such as the temperature and the solar radiation have to be included in the training data to ensure the model is able to extract useful messages in order to produce reliable eto estimation chen et al 2020b zhu et al 2020 similar to the hs equation the makkink equation and the romanenko equation most trained machine learning models are found to be only effective locally at the trained region albeit the latter with significant superiority in many instances chen et al 2020b this results in the situation where machine learning models have to be retrained again with local data in order to be useful the data hunger of machine learning models can be classified into qualitative hunger and quantitative hunger as shown in fig 1 there are research works available in the literature that attempted to solve this problem through various data management strategies to overcome the qualitative hunger different approaches had been adopted to determine the optimum input combination to the machine learning models for example chen et al 2020a demonstrated the possibility of reducing inputs for deep learning models using the principle component analysis pca and the maximal information coefficient mic feng et al 2017b on the other hand forced their models to accept only temperature data and proved that the elm and generalized regression neural network grnn performed better than the empirical models bellido jiménez et al 2021 used different types of features that can be measured easily such as the interval between maximum temperature time and sunset time as well as the integral of half hourly temperature in a day to estimate eto in humid regions as for the quantitative hunger different data management schemes were tested to reduce the need of locally collected data the state of the art include the work of kiafar et al 2016 where they had used cross station train and test method two pairs of station to evaluate the robustness of the gene expression programming gep model however it was found that the performance of the gep model was unstable and could not reach to a firm conclusion fan et al 2019 performed similar study using the light gradient boosting machine lgbm and the estimation of eto was found to be more promising as compared to the empirical and other machine learning models yan et al 2021 also reported their results by using the extreme gradient machine hybridized with whale optimization algorithm woa xgb shiri et al 2019 on the other hand had proposed seven data splitting strategies which included combinations of data from different stations and periods as well as addition of ancillary data considering the fact that only either temperature or radiation data was used to train their gep models the authors managed to reduce the qualitative hunger of the gep model the results revealed that the gep models trained and tested locally achieved the best accuracy and the performance can be boosted with the inclusion of ancillary data pattern of eto in this case from other external stations however the addition of ancillary data would actually increase the qualitative hunger of the gep models when the models were used at external stations the performance deteriorated significantly where the accuracy and generalizability could decline by more than 50 however the authors demonstrated that this decline can be mitigated by incorporating some external data into the training dataset shiri et al 2013 showed for the first time that a generalized anfis models performed better when trained using global data pool from different climate regions cross climatic eto estimation exhibited a significant drop in performance another study was conducted by wu et al 2019 to compare the performance of eight machine learning models in estimating eto with reduced data points in the study the authors pooled data from all stations into a global data pool for model training the resultant model was then tested at stations where their data were not included in the global data pool it was discovered that the svm managed to be one of the top ranked machine learning models consistently for all the cases tested subsequently the authors also applied the models to estimate eto with synthetic data produced through combining temperature and radiation data from different stations the svm was still the most consistent model for this part of experiment a more recent study conducted by kazemi et al 2021 extended the cross station validation using data from different countries the gep models were trained in turkey and applied in iran however the results were less promising with registered relative error that ranged between 15 and 28 the available literatures that demonstrate the importance of data management strategy to overcome the data hunger of machine learning models are still limited in the context of geographical location models used as well as the approaches adopted it is imperative to explore for more robust machine learning models and also evaluate for different ways to solve the problem models hunger for data in recent years a decision by committee approach has been widely applied in order to produce estimation with greater accuracy the inter model ensemble can be formed following various methods including through simple averaging bayesian modeling non linear neural ensemble nne and others chia et al 2021a granata and di nunno 2021 hao et al 2019 nourani et al 2019 therefore the main objective of this study is to assess the geographical robustness of various inter model ensembles in estimating daily eto besides the optimum input combinations of various meteorological parameters are also reported in the results of this study this work aims to 1 develop inter model ensembles that consist of an artificial neural network ann support vector regressor svr as well as the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis via bayesian modeling approach bma and the non linear neural ensemble nne 2 train inter model ensembles at different meteorological stations with differential geographical characteristics in the peninsular malaysia 3 determine the effect of the geographical characteristics on the performance of inter model ensembles 4 examine the effect of data management strategies applied to solve the data hungry issue both qualitative and quantitative of inter model ensembles the scope of this work is undoubtedly novel as no research has been published that explores the robustness of committee based inter model ensemble as a strategy to resolve their data hungry nature there is yet any other publication that reveal the abilities of inter model ensembles based on the bma and the nne in solving the aforementioned issue faced by the machine learning models let alone in a region with a typical tropical rainforest climate the success of this study could contribute to the estimation of daily eto in the peninsular malaysia with minimal amount of data qualitatively and quantitatively this would in turn minimize the dependency on local data collection and at the same time reduce the number of sensors or instruments needed for eto estimation purpose from a different perspective a massive amount of historical data is not essential for the purpose of developing models only for local use that has limited usage in this work the essential parameter was the solar radiation rs which can be easily computed through the location of the stations as well as the date of interest hence successful deployment of the models developed in this work could potentially eliminate the use or need of any data collection instruments the output of this research work would be even more valuable as it would be performed in the peninsular malaysia where its economy is mainly sustainably driven by agricultural commodities such as oil palm and rubber the ann svr and anfis models were selected as the base models because these three models represent the simplest form of machine learning models available for selection meanwhile the decision tree model another simple model was disregarded due to its binary nature that would be more useful for classification task instead of the regression duty required for this study the selection of the simplest machine learning models was justified by the need for computationally efficient models minimalistic approach instead of complex and sophisticated models that are widely developed nowadays the adaptation of the minimalistic approach is being regarded as one of the novelties of this study meanwhile the bma and nne were adopted as the hybridization approaches as they each represents the ensemble based on statistical modeling and black box operation respectively the comparison of the capabilities of different ensembles in terms of spatial robustness to overcome the data hunger of machine learning models are of interest in this current work which were not previously reported in the literature 2 methods 2 1 study location and data this research work was carried out in peninsular malaysia which is at proximity to the earth s equator this region has an area of 132 265 km2 approximately according to the köppen climate classification the region has a tropical rainforest climate which does not have any distinct dry season this in turn allows high output of agricultural product as there is no significant growth downtime the latest statistics published by the malaysian government shows that the agricultural sector is the third largest contributor to the nation s gross domestic production gdp hence the study of et and eto which represent the water loss from soil surface as well as water consumed to enable plant growth is important in this region five meteorological stations with different geographical characteristics were included in this study namely station 48620 sitiawan station 48623 lubok merbau station 48632 cameron highlands station 48647 subang and station 48649 muadzam shah the positions of these stations are pinned on a map illustrated in fig 2 the details as well as the geographical characteristics of the five meteorological stations under investigation are compiled in table 1 the number of stations included in this study was deemed adequate by referring to the area to station ratio of several previous studies mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 tao et al 2018 daily meteorological data were sourced from the jabatan meteorologi malaysia the malaysian meteorology department mmd the data provided by the mmd dated from the year 2000 2019 7305 days data points the information contained in the dataset included the maximum minimum and mean temperature tmax tmin tmean mean relative humidity rh mean wind speed u measured at 10 m from the ground ibrahim et al 2014 as well as solar radiation rs the parameters had been measured and collected at the elevations of the respective meteorological stations as stated in table 1 2 2 penman monteith equation the penman monteith pm equation was used to calculate the values of eto for different data points the calculated eto from the pm equation were treated as training data or examples to be shown to the machine learning models during the supervised learning process at the same time some of the eto computed from the pm equation were used to evaluate the accuracy of the developed inter model ensemble the pm equation is shown in eq 1 1 et o 0 408 r n g γ 900 t mean 272 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn net radiation mjm 2day 1 g soil heat flux mjm 2day 1 u2 wind speed at 2 m altitude m s es mean saturation vapor pressure kpa ea actual vapor pressure kpa slope of vapor pressure curve kpa c γ psychrometric constant kpa c data utilized for the daily eto calculation using the pm equation were corrected and adjusted to standard values as suggested in compliance to the crop evapotranspiration guidelines for computing crop water requirements fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 allen et al 1998 so that the resultant eto resembled the reference site conditions under standard and optimum conditions however for the development of the machine learning models sections 2 3 2 4 and 2 5 raw data were used to reduce the complexity in estimating daily eto specifically the machine learning models were trained to estimate standard eto using the normalized raw data 2 3 base models 2 3 1 artificial neural network inspired by the way the neurons in human brain transmit signals the artificial neural network ann that consists of an input layer an output layer and numerous hidden layers was introduced the input layer acts as the receptor whereas the output layer is the corresponding reflector the hidden layers between the input and output layers transmit information in the form of signal through the hidden neurons weights and biases analogous to cell body and axon of a biological neuron cell generally the mathematical representation of an ann can be written in the form as shown in eq 2 2 y f 1 n w i x i b where y output vector x input vector w weight b bias term it is important to note that in order to simplify the base ann model the authors of this study adopted a general design that follows the following rules a the ann models have only one hidden layer b the number of hidden neurons was decided based on n 1 where n is the number of input meteorological parameters c sigmoid activation function was used these general rules can be obtained from a series of trial and error that could optimize the modeling simplicity as well as accuracy of models abrishami et al 2018 2 3 2 support vector regressor the support vector machine svr is a kernel based machine learning model that generalize the regression based on the distribution of the transformed data in the feature space vapnik 1995 by using a kernel function the inputs are processed and a regression analysis will be done to fit the data using a hyperplane in this study the kernel function selected was the gaussian function also known as rbf function the selection of the rbf kernel function was justified as seen in several published works fan et al 2018 ferreira et al 2019 the computations involved in the learning and estimation of svr are shown in eq 3 to eq 6 3 y w φ x b where y output vector x input vector w weight vector φ selected kernel function b bias term the transformation of data into a feature space using gaussian kernel function is as following 4 k x n x i exp γ x n x i 2 c where x element of the input vector γ c hyperparameters during the training stage the w and b is optimized by finding the minimum value of the loss function r 5 r 0 5 w 2 c 1 n i 1 n l ε y m y o 6 l ε y m y o 0 i f y m y o ε y m y o ε o t h e r w i s e where 0 5 w 2 regularization term lε ε insensitive error function ε optimum distance between svr hyperplane and the support vectors ym model s prediction yo observed value 2 3 3 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis is a more linguistic machine learning models that allows the prediction or estimation to be done based on the likeliness the estimation of the anfis model is done by the membership functions as well as the fuzzy rules which are tuned and optimized using the ann model most literatures preferred sugeno type fuzzy rules over the mamdani type roy et al 2021 tao et al 2018 2 4 inter model ensembles an inter model ensemble involves more than one machine learning model in the process of estimation to be precise the ensemble will aggregate the estimations of individual machine learning models through a predefined method this method can be simple averaging or weighted averaging with different priorities in this study the author selected two hybridization methods namely the bayesian modeling approach bma as well as the nne using a stochastic enabled elm model 2 4 1 bayesian modeling approach there are two variations of bayesian modeling approach bma the bayesian model averaging and the bayesian model selection the two approaches share the same fundamental whereby the individual models assessed will be given a degree of truthfulness the degree of truthfulness can be imputed from the calculation of the posterior probabilities of the models estimations as shown in eq 7 7 p m i y p y m i p m i j n p y m j p m j where p mi y posterior model probability p mi prior model probability p y mi marginal likelihood n number of models considered the posterior model probability for each model obtained from eq 7 can be used to calculate the weightage of the individual models within the ensemble and subsequently the final estimation as portrayed in eq 8 and eq 9 8 w i p m i y i 1 n p m i y 9 y i 1 n w i y i where wi weightage of the ith model y vector of ensemble s estimation y i estimation vector of the ith model if one of the models gets a weightage of 1 it means that the model beats its rivals entirely and will be selected as the best model for simplicity the inter model ensembles developed through bma in this study are addressed as bma e 2 4 2 stochastic enabled extreme learning machine creating an inter model ensemble using the nne approach involves the aggregation of the estimations from individual models through a black box operation for this to be done there are numerous ways that can be thought of in this study the authors chose to perform such aggregation by using the stochastic enabled elm the elm model is one variation of the ann family that consists of only one hidden layer with randomly generated hyper parameters the elm model can be expressed mathematically in eq 10 and eq 11 10 f x i 1 l h i β i 11 h β t where l number of hidden neurons hi output of the ith neuron βi weight of the ith neuron h vector for the outputs of the hidden neurons β vector for the neurons weights t target vector due to its simple and light design the elm model has high computational speed but at the same time lacks the fine tune process to curb this problem an optimization algorithm is integrated to enable the process of stochastic tuning in order to explore for the optimum hyper parameters of the elm model the whale optimization algorithm woa was selected for such purpose the woa resembles the preying nature of a herd of whales that involves exploration and exploitation mirjalili and lewis 2016 the overall algorithms can be represented from equation 12 to eq 15 12 x t 1 x rand a c x rand x t 13 a 2 ar a 14 c 2 r 15 x t 1 x t a c x t x t when p 0 5 x t x t e bl cos 2 π l x t otherwise where x vector indicating the positions of the whales search

parameter of the bubble net l spiral coefficient p randomly generated number within 0 and 1 the dynamic change of the whale position is determined by the defined objective function or fitness value as shown in eq 16 16 fitness value rmse mae 1 r 2 2 5 data pre processing data normalization is an essential step to be taken in order to mitigate the scaling effect of the individual features in the input the normalization is done in accordance with eq 17 17 x norm x x min x max x min where x norm normalized vector of input vector x x input vector xmax maximum value in the vector x xmin minimum value in the vector x on top of that the authors investigated the best input combinations of meteorological parameters at different stations hence all the six meteorological parameters were shuffled and combined in different ways to produce a total of 63 input combinations to be studied the initial screening would help to select the best input combination with different number of parameters to be used in subsequent study all the possible input combinations are shown in fig 3 moreover during each training session the k fold cross validation set k to 10 was used in order to prevent possible overfitting of the machine learning models in this study the conventional k 10 was used fushiki 2009 granata 2019 jung et al 2020 this means that 90 of the data approximately 6575 data points would be used for training purpose while the remaining would be used as test data for each fold the results of each fold were averaged 2 6 performance evaluation to evaluate the performance of the inter model ensembles trained with either local or exogenous data several metrics were used the mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse assess the performances of the ensembles in terms of accuracy whereby rmse can detect large errors more effectively the mean bias error mbe and coefficient of determination r2 on the other hand were used to evaluate the generalizability of the ensembles for the error metrics mae rmse and mbe the closer they approach the zero value it means that the models are more accurate as for the r2 the value of 1 represents perfect fitting the mae rmse r2 and mbe are illustrated as in eq 18 to eq 21 respectively 18 mae mm day 1 n i 1 n y m i y o i 19 rmse mm day 1 n i 1 n y m i y o i 2 20 mbe 1 n i 1 n y m i y o i 21 r 2 i n y o i y o y m i y m i n y o i y o 2 i n y m i y m 2 where ym eto estimations with the machine learning models yo eto calculated from the pm equation respectively in order to evaluate the ensembles more comprehensively the global performance indicator gpi which combines multiple metrics was used despotovic et al 2015 the gpi score is positive oriented and a better model should achieve higher gpi score the gpi score can be calculated as shown in eq 22 22 gpi j 1 n α j y j y ij where y median of the scaled values of individual metrics yij scaled value jth metric for model i αi 1 for all metrics except for the r2 1 2 7 overall work flow in scheme 1 the inter model ensembles were developed locally using data at each station only the case of station 48620 sitiawan is used herein as an example for explanation purposes the ann svr and anfis models were trained at station 48620 sitiawan using its local data by considering all the 63 possible input combinations then six best input combinations consisting of one to six meteorological parameters were selected through bayesian screening and would be used for subsequent investigation the three based models were aggregated by with the bma as well as the nne to create two local inter model ensembles bma e and nne e the bma e and nne e were used to estimate eto in exogenous stations and tested for their performance in other words from the perspective of the other stations the bma e and nne e trained in station 48620 sitiawan were foreign models trained with exogenous data that can be used directly and did not require any of them to provide any historical data examples similar steps were done for the data at other stations meanwhile in scheme 2 another universal inter model ensemble was created using pooled data from all the stations this inter model ensemble was solely based on nne as it was impossible to tell the weightage of the base models all the modeling works were performed using the matlab r2016a platform the overall workflow of this work is illustrated in detail by fig 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 screening of best input combinations the ann svr and anfis models were trained and tested locally at all the stations investigated using different input combinations the accuracy and goodness of fit indicators for the ann svr and anfis models at all of the stations are plotted in heat maps as shown in fig 5 fig 6 and fig 7 respectively the exact values of the performance evaluation metrics can be found in the excel spreadsheet provided as the supplementary data the values of the metrics are represented by color scale in fig 5 fig 6 and fig 7 the closer the color is to clarity the better is the model performance hence one can easily distinguish the performances of the ann svr and anfis models at the stations using different input combinations at a single glance by comparing the three base models it can be seen that the ann model excelled in reducing the mae and rmse thus producing daily eto estimation with higher accuracy on the other hand the anfis model had better generalizability where the lower mbe was achieved the range of mbe incurred by the anfis model was between 0 001 mm day and 0 001 mm day which was lower than that of the ann between 0 01 mm day and 0 01 mm day as well as svr 0 1 mm day and 0 1 mm day models the svr model however produced the poorest performance nevertheless at this stage it is clear that models had their own strengths and weaknesses the ann model outperformed the svr and anfis models in terms of accuracy mae and rmse whereas the anfis had the best performance in terms of mbe at most of the stations the svr model performed less satisfactory than the ann and anfis models probably due to the rigidity of the svr architecture as compared to the other two base models that causes it to fail in handling highly non linear and fluctuating data michele et al 2019 by combining them to form an inter model ensemble it is expected that the models would complement each other in a positive manner by performing the bayesian screening the best input combinations from one to six input meteorological parameters were determined for each station the screening was done by going through the results presented in fig 5 fig 6 and fig 7 considering the performance of the ann svr and anfis models when different combinations were used as input in fact those input combinations that produced dark bands tiles in fig 5 fig 6 and fig 7 could be eliminated easily the results are summarized in fig 8 at all the stations it was decided to use the same group input combinations for one three five and six meteorological parameters b1 b3 b5 and b6 respectively however for the four meteorological parameters case the two stations that were covered with thick vegetation namely station 48623 lubok merbau and station 48629 it was preferred to have rh removed from the b5 group which was different from other stations that had tmin removed from b5 nevertheless both alternatives still came to the same combination for three input meteorological parameters this means that the priorities of rh and tmin were different for the two parties similarly for the two input parameters category only station 48632 cameron highlands which is located at a significantly higher altitude was chosen to have u removed instead of tmax from b3 the best input combinations at each station would be treated as permanent local properties that is to say during the development of the inter model ensembles the best input combinations would be used at the same time when a local model at one station was used to estimate the eto at another station it would require that the input meteorological parameters be based on the local best input combinations from fig 8 it can be seen that the rs was being regarded as the most important input parameter at all of the meteorological stations this was in agreement with many previous studies in region with similar climatic pattern ndiaye et al 2017 odongo et al 2019 on the other hand the tmean which had lower fluctuation and much of its characteristics covered in tmax and tmin was the least powerful driving factor for the eto estimation in the peninsular malaysia 3 2 development of inter model ensemble the inter model ensembles were developed locally at each station via the bma as well as the nne based on the stochastic enabled elm the bayesian weightage of the ann svr and anfis models at different stations were calculated based on the posterior probabilities and are tabulated as shown in table 2 it can be seen that except for station 48620 sitiawan the svr model was given the lowest weightage in the bma e this could be due to the fact that the svr model being the weakest model of all three did not have any outstanding traits in fact when the input meteorological parameters are sufficient at least three most stations would give higher weightage to the ann model in those cases the weightage of the ann model was 1 or very close to 1 which meant that the bma algorithm was switched to the bayesian model selection and considered only the ann in the bma e this was attributed to the unsurmountable superiority of the ann model when the input meteorological parameters were sufficient as shown by the results from the previous section however when the number of input meteorological parameters became lesser only one or two inputs the bayesian weightage awarded to the anfis model increased drastically this indicated that the anfis model had the ability to complement the ann model that had deteriorated accuracy when estimating eto with lesser input meteorological parameters similar findings were reported by kim et al 2016 whereby the bma ensemble would perform better if more models were incorporated into the ensemble on the other hand the nne e which followed a black box operation manner did not disclose any the weightage given to the participating base models chakraborty et al 2021 the inter model ensembles were built in such a way that the authors could only managed to examine the final product of the eto estimation 3 3 local performance of inter model ensembles in order to prove the efficacy and practicability of the developed inter model ensembles for robust usage the inter model ensembles would have to outperform the base models first nevertheless it is impractical to compare the evaluation metrics one by one which may contradict with each other therefore the gpi was used as the universal measurement of the performance of the base models as well as the inter model ensembles as shown in table 3 the accuracy and goodness of fit indicators of the base models and inter model ensembles can be found in the spreadsheet provided as supplementary data as shown in table 3 the inter model ensembles regardless of the bma e or the nne e model had the ability to outperform the based models this is especially obvious at station 48620 sitiawan and at station 48632 cameron highlands where the nne e models achieved the highest gpi score for all input combinations at the respective stations as mentioned earlier the nne e model worked on the basis of black box operation however it is believed that the exceptional performance of the nne e model at the two aforementioned stations could be due to two possible reasons firstly the nne e model had larger room for improvement at station 48620 sitiawan and station 48632 cameron highlands this was due to the fact that the mae as well as the rmse recorded at the two stations relative to the average eto were high as compared to other stations the nne e model was permitted to have a second look at the target value for further adjustment of the model s hyper parameters to enhance its accuracy furthermore the geographical locations of station 48620 sitiawan and station 48632 cameron highlands exhibited geographical extremes in terms of the elevation from the sea level the substantial effect of elevation on model performance had been confirmed in a study by xu et al 2018 for instance the modis models had lower accuracy at stations that were located higher elevations thus these factors offered additional conducive conditions for the nne e model to operate in turn achieving outstanding performance nonetheless the inter model ensemble including the bma e did improve from the benchmark performance of the base models there were some other cases where the ann model and the bma e had the same gpi score this happened when the bma algorithm was switched to the bayesian model selection mode and determined that ann was the best model among the base models in general for all the 30 test cases evenly distributed over five different stations the nne e was regarded as the best model for 21 times 70 while the bma e only had such achievement for two times 6 67 nevertheless the bma e managed to select the ann model as the best model six times 20 and failed to do so for one of the instances 3 33 at this stage the authors actually are able to tell that the nne e is the best inter model ensemble for estimating eto at all of the meteorological stations investigated the bma algorithm was proven to be feasible in improving the precipitate forecast accuracy over the south korea which is another peninsula in east asia jo et al 2012 meanwhile it was reported in another literature that the bma algorithm alone would not improve the estimation if its constituents within the ensemble performed poorly kim and suh 2013 in other words the potential and performance of the bma e model would be limited by the performance of the base models this property of the bma e model was again demonstrated in the results of this study whereby the performance of the bma e model was found to be unable to surpass that of the base models by a significant margin on the other hand the success of the nne e models to outperform the other base models and inter model ensembles was attributed to the way the development of the nne e model followed when the ann svr and anfis models were combined using the nne approach the algorithm actually had the opportunity to look at the target value for the second time chia et al 2021a this had allowed the internal structure of the woa elm meta learner to tune its internal parameter so that the accuracy and generalizability could be maximized the results of this study had a high level of agreement with the findings reported elsewhere for instance jang and oliveto 2021 used the ann as a meta learner to combine several regional climate models for the precipitate projections in the south korea it was found that the inclusion of suitable models into the ensemble would enhance the projection accuracy similar findings were also reported when such framework was used for streamflow prediction lee and ahn 2021 overall the utilization of a meta learner in nne modeling had shown promising efficiency in the improvement of estimation and prediction 3 4 testing with exogenous and pooled data the best models and input combinations at each of the meteorological stations investigated were tested at other stations at the same time the authors created a pool which consist of the entire data points from all of the stations except for the testing station the inter model ensembles or base models involved in the spatial robustness assessment are compiled in table 4 the results of the eto estimation at different stations using exogenous models were compared using the heat maps fig 9 to fig 14 show the comparison between the eto estimation using exogenous models inter model ensembles or base models and that of the local model with b6 b5 b4a b4b b3 b2a b2b and b1 respectively the actual value of the performance evaluation metrics can be retrieved from the supplementary data fig 9 to fig 14 can be analysed row by row as well as column by column if the heat maps are read diagonally the readers will be able to see the performance of the trained models when they were used locally when analysed row by row it can be seen that the models trained at station 48647 subang had the darkest tone for b6 to b4a b4b by referring to table 3 and table 4 it can be seen that the bma e were the best model for station 48647 subang for the input combinations mentioned in fact all the bma e at station 48647 subang selected ann as the best model of the station this observation can be used to infer that the ann itself is not a spatially robust model to be used exogenously for the eto estimation at other stations the hyperparameters of the ann models were highly region specific as in the case of empirical models which hampered its ability to be applied externally ferreira et al 2019 furthermore the models trained at station 48649 muadzam shah had the poorest performance for the input combinations b3 and b2a b2b fig 12 and fig 13 coincidently the selected models for these two input combinations were also built using the bma it is worth mentioning that for combination b3 the bma e developed also consisted of only the ann model which was similar to those of station 48647 subang that had the worst performance earlier on however for the combination b2a b2b the bma e at station 48649 muadzam shah was developed from the ann and anfis models due to this reason it is observable from fig 13 that the performance of the model trained at station 48649 muadzam shah did not lag behind other exogenous models by a lot except for the higher mbe values as for the input combination b1 model trained at station 48623 lubok merbau had the worst performance this result meets the expectation as the best model selected for this combination was the base ann models for the said station when fig 9 to fig 14 are analysed in a column by column manner the readers can determine which stations had the eto that can be easily interpreted from the heat maps the column of station 48632 cameron highlands consistently had the darkest tone it means that exogenous models were unable to estimate the eto at station 48632 cameron highlands accurately as a decision maker station 46832 cameron highlands should be selected as one of the stations to collect data if possible instead of using exogenous model from other stations on the contrary station 48649 muadzam shah had the eto that can be estimated very accurately by the other exogenous stations hence this station can be exempted for the data collection process from this analysis it can be deduced that the ann or bma e based on ann model is not suitable for exogenous application the results clearly showed that in order to have high spatial robustness the nne e have to be developed from the ann svr and anfis models through the black box operation the nne e is tuned such that it has better accuracy as well as generalizability overall the application of exogenous models to estimate eto is a feasible solution to solve the data hungry nature of machine learning models this can be justified by the low maximum mae and rmse incurred by the models 0 4602 mm day and 0 5579 mm day respectively when b2a b2b was used as well as the high r2 achieved generally above 0 9 despite the fact that the nne e model can be applied for wider spatial application it is undeniable that the performance of exogenous model could not surpass the performance of the local model which is reasonable similar findings were reported by yan et al 2021 however the closer the exogenous models get to the local model the better they are from fig 9 to fig 14 there is no station at which a model can be produced which perform consistently well at all the stations the best exogenous models based on the gpi scoring system using different input combinations are summarized in table 5 for input combinations with more meteorological parameters the best exogenous models are normally the nne e this is because the bma e would prefer the base ann model at this stage and hence the inter model ensemble cannot be formed to improvise the eto estimation however as the number of meteorological parameters decreased to three or two the bma e which had more than one base model constituents would begin to perform better one important phenomenon that has to be mentioned is that the performance ranking of the inter model ensembles were independent of the geographical characteristics of the stations the ensemble approaches were able to consider the difference in the geographical characteristics through repeated training nonetheless it can be witnessed that the best exogenous models were not consistently from one of the stations and it can be difficult to select which station to set up the data collection infrastructure lu et al 2018 reported that exogenous models were only recommended had the stations being less than 100 km apart in other words models trained using local data exhibited relatively weak spatial robustness in this study the weakness of the models when being applied externally had been greatly reduced as a result of hybridization however in the case of extreme difference in the weather conditions such as at station 48632 cameron highlands the exogenous models still could not estimate the eto accurately therefore the pooled data can be used as a stabilizer to maintain the performance of model trained using the exogenous data from the results it is desirable to put all the available data in a data pool and use the pooled data for exogenous model development scheme 2 instead of solely depending on either one local station scheme 1 fig 9 to fig 14 reveal that the exogenous models trained using pooled data exhibited smaller fluctuations in their performance as compared to the models trained locally and at each of the stations the results of this study were in agreement with other researches carried out at different regions it was found previously that the use of data from the majority stations to forecast eto at the minority stations had comparable performance with the local test case ferreira and da cunha 2020 although longer time lags were needed to convey a larger amount of information the reason behind the superiority of the models trained with global data pool was that it was made up of dataset with greater variation in other words it considers more distinctive cases which can be inclusive of any other undiscovered regions despite the fact that models trained with the global data pool were still unable to estimate with the best accuracy the daily eto at station 48632 cameron highlands the data of this station was not included in the data pool their performance were considered consistent under the different scenarios it was believed the performance of the models trained with global data pool can be further improved with the inclusion of more data from different meteorological stations in fact an apple to apple comparison can be made between the models developed in this study with empirical models investigated in the work by chia et al 2020a in that particular investigation the hs makkink and romanenko equations were used to estimate the eto of station 48620 sitiawan the minimum mae rmse and mbe reported were 0 444 mm day 0 543 mm day and 0 0207 and were much higher than those reported in this study even if b1 only rs was used as the input parameter was used as the input combination for woa elm e model 0 1142 mm day 0 1454 mm day and 0 0000 respectively this represents improvements in mae rmse and mbe of 74 3 73 2 and 100 respectively it is worth to mention that the hs makkink and romanenko equations used in the cited study had been well calibrated yet unable achieve the accuracy of the exogenous models in this study this means that the developed woa elm e model had better performance and generalizability than the empirical models it can be well hypothesized that similar findings could be achieved in other stations 4 conclusion the eto estimation based on the machine learning models often runs into the bottleneck of limited data supply the data hungry nature of the machine learning models can be expressed qualitatively and quantitatively this research work presents a novel approach to solve the aforementioned problem inter model ensembles based on the bma and the nne using stochastic enabled elm were trained using local data it was found that local applications of such inter model ensembles could improvise the accuracy of the eto estimation the inter model ensembles were then tested in other stations to assess their spatial robustness using the best input combinations by assuming local data were missing at the test stations it was found that the nne e models had sufficiently good spatial robustness where the estimations of eto in other stations were of high accuracies on the other hand the bma e could only perform well when it was constituted of more than one base models however the performances of the bma e and nne e trained using the data of only one station were volatile the utilization of the global data pool was able to solve this problem by training the inter model ensembles using data from more than one stations it was found that the performances of the inter model ensembles were independent of the geographical characteristics it is believed that this difference was considered by the black box operation of the machine learning models through repeated training the outcome of this work shows that it is possible to develop a universal model for the estimation of eto across the peninsular malaysia without the need for historical data to develop a local model a robust machine learning model based on the nne trained using a global data pool that had its geographical robustness proven can be the solution to resolve the data hungry nature of the classical machine learning models this can be a huge contribution to aid the national level decision making when the water resources management is highly dependent on the projected et and eto however the resolution and granularity of this study still can be improved if data from other stations are made available inevitably the performance of the nne e models still needs to be verified at other regions therefore the authors of this article sincerely invite researchers to collaborate through the sharing of local data from their origins as this will be very useful to confirm the spatial robustness of the inter model ensemble

9757,soil moisture content smc prediction can contribute to diverse geo science engineering applications such as plantation crops production and several irrigation activities although there have been several methodologies introduced for the sms estimation methods are still associated with challenges and limitations e g time consuming high cost and the need for large data sets in the current research the motivation was inspired to develop new data intelligence models that are capable to estimate smc accurately and reliably several hybridized adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system nf models were developed the feasibility of four meta heuristic algorithms including the gray wolf optimization gwo bee algorithm ba firefly algorithm fa and imperialistic competitive algorithm ica were used to improve the predictability performance of the nf model the performances of the hybrid models were tested at two different climate characteristics i e humid and arid and four different soil depths 5 10 20 and 50 cm the dataset used in this study were consisted of ten years with daily scale practical inputs predictors for the prediction matrix were identified using the mutual information method mi and correlation coefficient which included maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation and soil temperature k fold technique and various indices were used to evaluate hybrid models despite the promising results of all developed models the nf fa is superior to the others in both climates the average results of all depths in humid climate using correlation coefficient r mean absolute percentage error mape and scattering index si were 0 924 6 089 and 0 074 respectively while in the arid climate nf fa model attained 0 903 14 439 and 0 176 in r mape and si respectively the evaluation of different depths and climates showed that nf fa yielded the best accuracy within humid climates and depths of 20 and 10 cm had the lowest estimation error in humid and arid climates this study introduced the fa algorithm as an efficient tool in nf development to estimate smc by readily available inputs without knowing soil physical parameters graphical abstract ga1 keywords adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system meta heuristic algorithms mutual information soil moisture content 1 introduction 1 1 research background soil moisture content smc is considered as a significant component in the hydrological cycle affects the soil s physical and chemical processes and plays an important role in the environment hydrological patterns and climate change badía et al 2017 kumar et al 2018 smc is an influential factor in developing the sustainable agricultural management practices tian et al 2017 this is because by determining the exact status of soil moisture in the fields more informative decision can be taken for better management of irrigation systems and other geo science applications further having sufficient knowledge on smc at critical crop growth stages is essential to improve crop yield save water and overall cost savings greaves and wang 2017 holzman et al 2018 kang et al 2017 despite advances in technology smc measurement and estimation techniques face limitations zhu et al 2013 these methods include on site measurement remote sensing and physical and mathematical models peng et al 2017 smc on site measurements are time consuming and not cost effective in terms of installation calibration and maintenance issues on the other hand satellites and remote sensing for smc estimation seem suitable for increasing spatial coverage however satellites can provide accurate estimates of smc if the area is far from the ocean and lake and the smc is considered a few centimeters above the ground 1 5 cm mahfouf 2010 yang et al 2017 other factors that increase uncertainty of satellite results include dew soil roughness radiant fog and vegetation water content mahfouf 2010 on the other hand physical models suffer from the multiplicity of variables required which may not be suitable for application at the local scales prasad et al 2018a i e the waterdyn model uses meteorological variables including precipitation radiation minimum and maximum temperatures as well as various climatic maps of albedo soil characteristics and seasonality of vegetation greenness to estimate smc raupach et al 2009 2012 mathematical models are common methodologies for estimating smc especially through linear regression models nawar et al 2014 xu et al 2016 however linear regression models need modification because the relationship between effective parameters and soil characteristic features rarely obeys a linear relationship hence the motivation to explore new emerging technologies that can be sufficiently adapted for smc estimation is the motive recently directed matei et al 2017 also the variation in the smc and the different climatic features emphasize the establishment of more generalized technology capable of mimicking the actual soil characteristics cai et al 2019 1 2 artificial intelligent models literature review artificial intelligent ai is one of the recommended tools in the category of computer aid models that can be used in practice by saving both time and cost riahi et al 2021 despite advances in smc measurement procedures the constraints of achieving accurate results are a significant challenge ai techniques have been utilized successfully in soil and water parameters simulations i e soil erosion yavari et al 2018 soil moisture prasad et al 2018b irrigation systems maroufpoor et al 2019c seyedzadeh et al 2020 actual evapotranspiration and crop yield babaee et al 2021 elbeltagi et al 2020 jing et al 2019 kisi 2016 muhammad et al 2021 and water quality and quantity parameters jamei et al 2020 maroufpoor 2020b maroufpoor et al 2017 most of these studies have evaluated stand alone ai methods that face inherent constraints in generalization as a preliminary concern of their applicability as a matter of fact ai models are based on internal optimization parameters tuning bayatvarkeshi et al 2021 yaseen 2021 those parameters are the main influential elements on the learning processes of machine learning models to address this constraint researchers have proposed the use of optimization based on meta heuristic algorithms for solving this problem and several domains on hydrology and climatology have been evidenced their capacity maroufpoor et al 2019a naganna et al 2019 tao et al 2018 tikhamarine et al 2019 2020a another primary concern for implementing machine learning models is the inability to manage inputs parameters for the prediction matrix afan et al 2020 karandish and šimůnek 2016 this can be explained by the association of the non stationarity and non linearity features for the current study soil moisture content and meteorological variables are naturally non stationary that cause non linearities non normality and asymmetric cycles wu et al 2011 hence to identify patterns and non stationary features it is necessary to use data processing techniques to improve model training 1 3 research motivation and objectives based on the reported literature review studies this research was intended to propose new emerging technology of data intelligent model for smc the current investigation does not aim to replicate only the evaluation results of predictability performance of ai models it extends a superior approach without previous concerns in estimating smc at low cost including time labor and money the objectives of the present study are to address the limitations mentioned above hence the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system nf model was selected as a popular ai model in time series estimation kisi et al 2021 malik et al 2019 maroufpoor et al 2019b that combines fuzzy logic with an artificial neural network for the purpose of initiating more robust machine learning model four meta heuristic algorithms including the gray wolf optimization gwo bee algorithm ba firefly algorithm fa and imperialistic competitive algorithm ica were integrated with nf the ability of hybrid models against each other and stand alone models was then assessed therefore it is necessary to compare the algorithms according to the target parameter in the problems the k fold technique was employed to identify various input patterns and non stationary features to ensure the ability of the proposed approaches two wet and dry climate zones north carolina and nevada county in the usa as well as four different depths 5 10 20 and 50 cm were selected on a daily scale the minimum number of inputs was used for the proposed techniques so that these techniques have the potential for practical application at the local scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system nf the concept of fuzzy inference was first introduced in 1965 zadeh 1965 a fuzzy inference system fis is a base rule system based on observational data nf is a combination of fuzzy systems and artificial neural networks that can deal with uncertainty and noise the fuzzy part determines the relationship between the input and output of the model in the fuzzy part the most important role is played by membership functions the parameters of which are regulated by neural network training algorithms there are five layers in the nf structure the first layer performs the fuzzy process of inputs and determines the extent to which each input belongs to different fuzzy intervals kisi and yaseen 2019 the second layer shows the weight of each rule which is obtained by multiplying each node s input values sharafati et al 2020 the third layer normalizes the weight of the rules relative to each other in the fourth layer the output of each rule is calculated and in the final layer the output of the fuzzy system is determined by summing the outputs of the fourth layer factors influencing the nf structure include the type of input and output membership functions mf the method of optimizing mf parameters and the number of iterations the fuzzy inference style used in this study is sugeno back propagation and least squares methods were selected to optimize mf parameters input and output membership functions were considered triangular and constant with trial and error more details about the nf model are available in jang 1993 in this study to increase the nf capability four optimization algorithms including gwo fa ba and ica were used to optimize the parameters of the nf structure the flowchart of which is shown in fig 1 2 2 meta heuristic algorithms 2 2 1 firefly algorithm fa the firefly algorithm fa was proposed by yang 2010 the bioluminescence connection between fireflies inspires the main idea of this algorithm fa is in the category of swarm intelligence algorithms that the cooperation and competition of simple and low intelligence members create a higher level of intelligence yang and he 2013 the fa algorithm is based on the following rules 1 all fireflies are bisexual and regardless of gender one firefly absorbs all other fireflies 2 the degree of attractiveness of a firefly is proportional to its brightness brightness may also decrease with increasing distance from other fireflies however if there is the no brighter firefly then the movement will be random 3 the value of the cost function determines the brightness or light intensity of a firefly fa is a population based evolutionary algorithm inspired by the behavior of fireflies in search of food and their population intelligence in nature fireflies move randomly and each ﬁreﬂy finds a better prey and emits more light to attract other members the greater the distance between the two fireflies the lower their absorption percentage in other words distance is inversely related to speed and absorption the two essential parts of fa include changes in light intensity and moving toward a lighter firefly if n fireflies are selected in the search space the cost function brightness of each firefly is as follows yang 2010 1 i i f x i 0 i n where i i is the brightness of each particle each firefly and x i is the position of the ith particle it is also the absorption function given in eq 2 2 β r β 0 e γ r 2 where β 0 is the absorption rate per zero distance r 0 and γ is the absorption coefficient the movement of particle i with position xi towards particle j with more light and position xj is as follows 3 x i t 1 x i t β r x j x i where xi t 1 is the position of the particle i at time t 1 fa performance is entirely dependent on initial population size iteration and absorption coefficient the higher the light absorption coefficient the greater the convergence of the particles in this study the number of iteration the initial population of fireflies and the absorption coefficient were in the ranges of 400 850 35 50 and 1 5 3 5 respectively which were determined by trial and error based on the lowest error 2 2 2 imperialist competitive algorithm ica the ica algorithm was introduced in 2007 as a new approach to modeling based on socio political relationships atashpaz gargari and lucas 2007 in the ica the phenomenon of colonialism is recognized as an integral part of human historical evolution like other evolutionary algorithms the ica starts with random primary populations each of which is called a country some of these countries will be empires and the rest will be colonized the strongest countries will be the imperialist for the initial division of the colonies among the imperialists each imperialist is assigned several colonies commensurate with their power the power of an empire depends on the two constituent parts of the empire the imperialist state and its colonies mathematically this relation is represented as the sum of the power of the imperialist country plus a percentage of the average power of its colonies with the initial formation of empires imperialist competition begins between them in this competition the imperialist who has less power than the other imperialists loses one of his colonies in this process the weakest colony of the weakest empire randomly joins another empire if an imperialist loses all its colonies it becomes a colony talatahari et al 2012 therefore the survival of an empire depends on its power to absorb the colonies of competitor empires during the imperialist competition the power of the larger empires will gradually increase and the weaker empires will collapse over time from the beginning of the algorithm the colonies move continuously and convergence occurs as the colonies move toward the imperialist some colonies may achieve a better position than the imperialist based on the objective function in this situation the position of the imperialist and the colony are switched and the algorithm continues with the new imperialist country the algorithm stops when a single empire is created with colonies very close to the imperialist country of course other stop conditions such as a certain number of iterations may cause the algorithm to stop in this study based on trial and error the number of countries empires and iterations were determined in the ranges of 100 300 5 10 and 1000 1500 respectively the steps of the ica algorithm are shown in fig 2 2 2 3 bee algorithm ba ba was first developed based on the life and behavior of bees karaboga and basturk 2007 each bee colony consists of three groups of bees each of which has specific responsibilities scout bees are the first group whose task is to discover food sources these bees are randomly scattered around the hive in different distances and directions and search for food after returning to the hive the pioneer bees share their information with other hive bees in a waggle dance after sharing information the second group of bees called the employed bee exploits the food source discovered onlooker bees make up the third group of bees in a hive these bees wait for other bees inside the hive and after exchanging information in a spin dance select a food source that is more valuable than other sources to be exploited in the bee algorithm each food source is a possible solution to the optimization issue also the amount of nectar in food sources indicates the quality of the solution the number of food sources i 1 2 3 n in this algorithm is a fraction of the number of scout bees evaluation of nectar information from food sources is done by the onlooker bees based on the following equation karaboga and basturk 2007 4 p i f i t i i 1 n f i t i 0 i n where pi is the probability of choosing the food source of i fiti the degree of competence and quality of the solution of i n is the number of food sources if the amount of nectar from the proposed source is more significant than the previous source stored in the bee s memory the new position is held and the previous position is forgotten otherwise the previous position is maintained if a solution does not improve after a certain number of iterations in the ba algorithm it is considered an abandoned food source effective parameters in ba include the number of cycles number of scout bees and ratio of feed source to scout bees in the present study these parameters were determined by trial and error based on model improvement in the range of 1000 1500 number of cycles 35 70 number of bees and 0 5 2 ratio of food source to number of bees the algorithm s convergence increased with these parameters and achieving the optimal solution was associated with a minor error 2 2 4 gray wolf optimizer gwo the gwo algorithm is an optimization approach inspired by wolves nature and social behavior when hunting prey mirjalili et al 2014 gwo is population based and has a simple configuration structure that can be easily generalized to large scale problems the hierarchy in gray wolves lives is stringent and includes four types of wolves alpha α beta β delta δ and omega ω the social life of gray wolves is in packs of 5 12 wolves each with its individual tasks the leader is chosen from the alpha wolves and the beta wolves are known as their deputy therefore beta wolves are prone to alpha replacement alpha wolves despite being leaders do not have the most power but they have the highest level of management delta wolves are known as retired old wolves as well as sentries the lowest right to interfere in the pack belongs to omega wolves they even eat after all and do not participate in the decision making process the main steps for hunting gray wolves are tracking and approaching pushing and encircling and attacking respectively in gwo the optimization process is performed by three solutions alpha beta and delta the rest of the solutions are considered omega in other words alpha beta and delta estimate the hunting position and other wolves randomly update their position in the area around the prey determining the initial population and the number of iterations are the main parameters in this algorithm that were selected by trial and error in the intervals of 30 50 and 1000 respectively more details of the algorithm structure can be surveyed through the literature review maroufpoor et al 2020a tikhamarine et al 2020b 2 3 data pre processing 2 3 1 data description and study area in this study data from the us climate reference network uscrn were used uscrn was established by the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa two stations including asheville a station and mercury b station in north carolina and nevada having different climatic contexts were selected to evaluate the models fig 3 station a s latitude longitude and altitude are 35 42 82 56 and 641 m respectively also for station b latitude 36 62 longitude 116 02 and altitude are 1001 m according to the international energy conservation code iecc ellis 2014 the states of north carolina and nevada have humid 5b and arid 3a climatic conditions fig 3b the noaa research team described the method of measuring soil moisture content at different depths bell et al 2013 daily data covering a ten years period 2020 2011 were selected to assess the developed methodology typically when ai models are applied the feeding patterns are divided into two training and testing or three training validation and testing parts e g held out method this process increases the bias in estimation further by adopting held out methods the model can t learn all the successive patterns in this study the k fold cross validation technique was used to cover all successive time patterns in the model s training therefore the data were divided into ten folds 10 years and each year was evaluated at least once in the test section the use of five folds or more is recommended to reduce the estimated bias rodriguez et al 2009 also increases the number of folds reduces the variance magnitudes and the risk of over fitting shao 1993 the available data included maximum and minimum air temperature tmax tmin c maximum and minimum relative humidity rhmax rhmin precipitation p mm solar radiation sr mj m 2 soil moisture smc m3 m 3 and soil temperature st c at four depths 5 10 20 and 50 cm the statistical characteristics of the data are presented in table 1 there is a significant difference between the statistical indices of the two stations soil moisture precipitation and relative humidity in station a have higher mean values than station b however other parameters have a higher mean in station b the highest coefficient of variation in both stations was related to the precipitation parameter based on the standard deviation of the data the highest deviation from the mean values at station a and b was the minimum and maximum relative humidity parameters respectively the results of statistical properties confirm the different climates of the two stations 2 3 2 sensitivity analysis and input selection strategy the first step in this section was to calculate the pearson correlation coefficient at stations a and b fig 4 as can be seen from the figure p has the lowest correlation with soil moisture at both locations while the soil temperature for each depth showed the highest inverse correlation solar radiation and maximum and minimum temperatures also showed slight correlations the low correlation values are due to the nonlinear relationship of soil moisture with other variables the second step was to perform sensitivity analysis with the mutual information method mi mi is derived from the concept of entropy which is a measure of uncertainty and randomness cover and thomas 1991 the mi between two variables x and y was calculated based on the following equation cover and thomas 1991 5 mi y x g y g x g y x where mi y x is mutual information between y and x g y is the entropy of y g x is the entropy of x and g y x is joint entropy which are defined as 6 g y y y p y log p y 7 g x x x p x log p x 8 g y x y y x x p y x log p y x where p y and p x are the marginal probabilities of y and x and p y x is the joint probability the results of mi for both stations are presented in fig 5 almost the st at each depth showed the most mutual information followed by tmax tmin and sr as expected p is associated with high uncertainty and low mi finally it can be concluded that the correlation coefficient and mutual information refer to the soil temperature variables for each depth solar radiation and maximum and minimum temperature these variables were also recommended by prasad et al 2018a to estimate soil moisture and therefore were selected as practical inputs here as well 2 4 performance assessment indicators a comprehensive assessment is needed to understand the models ability to estimate here models at each station were compared based on pearson correlation coefficient r willmott s index wi mean absolute percentage error mape and uncertainty with 95 confidence level u95 ehteram et al 2021 yaseen 2021 r is a non dimensional index that quantifies the relationship between estimated and observed values but it is not reliable for evaluation because the model with low estimation accuracy can have a high correlation the advantage of wi is to identify differences in mean and variance between estimated and observed values the scatter index si was used to compare the performance of the models between the two stations si is a scale independent indicator that evaluates based on relative error the ideal values for r and wi are one and zero for u95 mape and si the equations of the indicators are as follows 9 r i 1 n o i o e i e i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n e i e 2 10 w i 1 i 1 n o i e i 2 i 1 n e i o i o i o i 2 11 m a p e 1 n i 1 n o i p i o i 100 12 u 95 1 96 s d 2 1 n i 1 n o i e i 2 2 13 s i 1 n i 1 n o i e i 2 o where o i e i o and e are ith smc values of the observed and estimated average values of observed and estimated respectively also sd and n represent the standard deviation of estimation error and number of records 3 application results and analysis 3 1 humid climate station a the statistical indicators and the architecture of the models at all studied depths have been presented in table 2 for both the studied locations the structure and parameters set in this table for each model were described in the materials and methods section for depth of 5 cm the nf fa5 on account of r 0 943 wi 0 975 and mape 9 429 was superior to other hybrid models followed by nf ica5 r 0 938 nf gwo5 r 0 937 nf ba5 r 0 905 and nf r 0 901 respectively comparing the mape values exhibited that the nf fa5 and nf ba5 models by reducing 28 and 4 5 against nf had the best and weakest performance in estimating smc at depth of 5 cm respectively besides fig 6 a demonstrates the scatter plots of all models for smc estimation at 5 cm in the humid climate station a it can be seen that the predicted smc values obtained by the nf fa5 have better agreement with the observational data sets whereas the nf ica5 and nf gwo5 are stood in the second and third ranks respectively fig 7 depicts the probability distribution function of error values based on maximum minimum q25 median and q75 indices for all predictive models in four considered depths of soil at humid climate station a according to fig 7 a nf fa5 due to having a minimum interquartile range iqr q3 q1 of 0 031 yielded the most promising results compared to the other models the statistical indices for depth of 10 cm reported in table 2 showed that the nf fa10 owing to highest r 0 946 and wi 0 973 and lowest diagnostic error mape 6 687 provided the best performance accuracy for estimation of smc computationally it might be stated that nf fa10 nf gwo10 and nf ica10 by 30 26 6 and 18 5 improvement of mape in the nf10 model are identified as the best predictors respectively moreover fig 6 b showed that the data points obtained from the nf fa10 model are concentrated around the identity line and have a more logical fit and consistency than other hybrid models however the nf gwo10 and nf ica10 models also had slightly similar accuracy to the nf fa10 method and yielded reliable precision to estimate smc at 10 cm of soil furthermore fig 7 b illustrated that nf fa10 iqr 0 023 nf gwo10 iqr 0 026 and nf ica10 iqr 0 029 efficiently improved the accuracy of modeling smc at 10 cm of soil by 34 26 and 17 compared to the stand alone nf10 model the predictive capabilities assessment of the models presented to predict the smc at the 20 cm of soil exhibits the superiority of the nf fa20 model regarding r 0 966 and mape 3 785 compared to nf gwo20 r 0 962 nf ica20 r 0 957 and nf20 r 0 919 on one hand the scatter plots of fig 6 c confirmed more agreement between the estimated and observational smc data points using nf fa20 however the recorded error estimation of the results generated by the respective approaches clearly proved that the nf fa20 with minimum values of iqr 0 0153 and error band 0 1273 led to the most precise outcomes among all provided models evaluation of the statistical metrics and graphical tools belong to the ai models for predicting the smc values at the 50 cm of soil demonstrated more efficiency of nf fa50 with respect to higher r 0 870 and lower iqr error estimation 0 870 than the other hybrid nf models however the efficiency of all the models at this depth 50 cm is significantly less than other depths of modeling according to distributed pattern owing to predicted data points see figs 6 d and 7 d to compare the performance of the proposed models and examine their predictability potential the uncertainty u95 values for each model at the four depths are shown in fig 8 it is clear crystal that the nf fa model regarding the lowest u95 for various depths 0 0728 for 5 cm 0 0553 for 10 cm 0 0364 for 20 cm and 0 0542 for 50 cm was identified as the most efficient models followed by nf gwo nf ica nf ba and stand alone nf models nf gwo model is in the second rank in terms of accuracy this model has also been previously evaluated in estimating soil moisture and had promising results maroufpoor et al 2019a also the best accurate results for predicting smc of soil were obtained in the depth of 20 cm u95 0 0364 among all examined situations 3 2 arid climate station b sophisticated metrics and graphical validation tools conducted the ability assessment of the provided ai model in station b with arid climate according to table 2 the results belong to the depth of 5 cm proved that the nf fa5 model by the optimal statistical criteria r 0 934 wi 0 984 and mape 18 93 outperformed the nf ica5 r 0 930 and mape 19 844 nf wgo5 r 0 9325 and mape 22 444 nf ba5 r 0 909 and mape 27 112 and nf r 0 909 and mape 27 112 respectively however for this situation the predictive performance of nf fa5 and nf ica5 was closed to each other fig 9 demonstrated the performance comparison between estimated and observational smc values for all considering soil depths in the arid climate scenario station b regarding fig 9 a the superiority of nf fa5 is evident based on the perfect distribution pattern around the 1 1 line compared to other hybrid models as the nf ba5 and nf were farther away than the observational dataset for a better assessment of the efficiency of provided models the estimated error distribution in form of box plots is shown in fig 10 per fig 10 a the quartile error metric proved the acceptable precision of the nf fa5 and nf ica5 on account of minimum iqr of 0 00684 and 0 0093 smc at the 5 cm of depth the robustness of the models at a depth of 10 cm shows that the nf fa10 can show better performance than other methods due to the highest accuracy based on r 0 92 and mape 11 173 while the nf ica10 r 0 916 and nf wgo10 r 0 15 were as good as the nf fa10 in terms of accuracy fig 9 b confirmed that the three aforementioned models are more accurate than the nf ba10 and nf10 models regarding the diagnostic metric i e q25 q75 min max and median nf fa10 nf gwo10 and nf ica10 decreased the error of the nf10 model by 18 6 12 3 and 8 7 values respectively fig 9 b finally the robustness of the hybrid models in comparison stand alone nf for modeling the smc of soil at 50 cm as the previously concluded outcome from the diverse depths clearly confirmed the superiority of nf fa50 strategy owing to the best r 0 826 wi 0 946 and mape 14 099 against nf gwo50 r 0 718 nf ica50 r 0 717 nf ba50 r 0 643 and nf50 r 0 552 although the obtained results in this situation were not as well as the 5 cm 10 cm and 20 cm depths of soil fig 9 d depicted the estimated smc values compared to the observational data sets where the agreement of estimated outcomes with the line of 45 is not perfect and ideal besides in accordance with fig 10 d the nf fa50 and nf ica50 on the basis of q25 0 0043 and q75 0 00437 and q25 0 0045 and q75 0 0050 outperformed the other models for a general assessment of the ai approaches at the various depths in station b fig 11 demonstrated the uncertainty values in form of a bar plot it is clear crystal that the lowest values of u95 have occurred at the depth of 20 cm and the best predictive performance belongs to the nf fa model which was able to improve the accuracy based on u95 of the stand alone nf model with 22 2 18 3 30 and 40 8 for 5 cm 10 cm 20 cm 50 cm depths of the soil respectively the stand alone nf model is known as one of the efficient models in estimating soil water capacity parameters shiri et al 2017 which was developed in this research with meta heuristic algorithms 3 3 performance comparison of the models the main purpose of this section is to compare the performance of the models presented in the humid and arid climates in estimating the amount of smc fig 12 exhibited the radar plots of the si index for two explored climates in four depths of soil confidently it can be concluded that the si values green line belong to the humid climate are lower than those of the arid climate red line which implied that all models for the humid climate are more promising than the arid one furthermore nf fa due to minimum values of si in all the depths and all studied climates was identified as the best paradigm for the estimation of smc in addition the best outcomes for humid scenario station a are related to 20 cm depth of soil in term of si nf fa 0 0483 whereas for the arid scenario station b belongs to 10 cm depth of soil with si nf fa 0 01389 generally through prior discussions can be concluded that the nf gwo nf ica and nf ba stood in the next best ranks as the efficient predictor alternative for modeling the smc in both inspected climates it is noteworthy that the least accuracy in both scenarios station a and station b was related to the results obtained at the 50 cm of depth and smc modeling at this depth was not very satisfactory even for hybrid ai approaches eventually fig 13 shows the trend plot of developed models where the nf fa had the best performance in each climate at the 20 cm of soil in station a and at the 10 cm of soil in station b respectively the zones that have the highest oscillations were magnified to better examine the model s ability to capture the non linearity of smc time series in the below of each trend plot the upper panel of fig 13 between 160 and 1800 days showed that nf fa at station a has the superior performance in estimating smc followed by nf ica and nf gwo respectively besides the lower panel of fig 13 similarly exhibited the better predictive performance of nf fa at station b than the other models moreover the nf gwo and nf ica stood in the next ranks whereas the stand alone nf model was the disappointing accuracy in both climates and all the depths of soil 4 discussion and possible future research the applied predictive models have shown the significant hybridized ml models potential in solving the smc problem the integration of the optimization algorithms has substantially improved the predictability performance of the nf model also the applied predictive models behaved differently for the selected climate regions as the climate characteristic remarkably influenced the data stochasticity also it is worth that smc for each depth attained varied estimation accuracy that clearly explains the complexity of the smc as various geo science factors are affecting the different smc depths however the predictive models especially nf fa revealed superior estimation performance in this study nf performance was improved by meta heuristic algorithms maroufpoor et al 2019a also improved nf performance with the gwo algorithm to estimate soil moisture and compared the results with artiﬁcial neural network ann and support vector regression svr models the nf gwo model performed better than the other two models this result was also proved in this study because nf gwo was one of the top models moosavi et al 2016 also studied the hybrid model of nf particle swarm optimization pso and svr pso to estimate soil moisture which svr pso was superior to nf pso previous research shows that it is not appropriate to choose a general model and algorithm for estimating soil moisture content because the results will be different for each region and site in this regard chaudhary et al 2021 assessed 12 machine learning models to estimate soil moisture and confirmed the superiority of three models nf random forest rf and subtractive clustering sbc based on the reported research results it is worth to mention the validity of the data span based on the estimation attained by the developed hybrid ml models it is clearly can be notice that the data span was sufficient enough to build the learning process of the network of the intelligent model the next step of the current research can be devoted on the feasibility to developed intelligent expert system that can be beneficial more in the practical aspects future research can be devoted on developing and designing up to date smc data sampling based on advanced federated learning fl technology the functionality of the fl can be tested for more practical smc detection and monitoring the expected system is fundamentally constructed based on distributed network architecture and smart internet of thing iot sensors system edge servers and centralized could for fl aggregation fig 14 the first phase consisted of several sensors to collect the smc data and transmits to the second phase where the edge server gathers all the information to be supplied to the predictive model the third phase comprised the fl process that is communicated the modeling results with centralized cloud the fl centralized cloud initiate the update for the global model prediction the advantage of this model is to have more informative intelligence model that can be practically contribute to the decision making of the related environmental engineering 5 conclusion this study was a step in the development and advancement of smc estimation techniques for this purpose four meta heuristic algorithms including gwo ba fa and ica were integrated with the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system nf model the sensitivity analysis of the inputs was performed by mutual information method mi and correlation matrix finally the maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation and soil temperature were selected as practical inputs in estimating smc two humid and arid climates and four different depths including 5 10 20 and 50 cm were evaluated to ensure the application of the proposed models the results showed that the fa algorithm is an efficient tool in developing nf in both climates depths of 20 and 10 cm showed the lowest estimation error values in humid and arid stations respectively by comparing the performance of the models in the two climates it was found that the estimation of smc in humid climates is associated with a lower relative error index si the nf gwo and nf ica models also had promising results after the nf fa despite extensive research in soil moisture estimation the hybrid models of the present study except nf gwo have not yet been evaluated in soil moisture estimation having promising performance in two different climates was another strength of the proposed models to ensure the applicability of the proposed models and their development in different climates and depths it is necessary to evaluate these models in other conditions and regions however this process requires resetting the model parameters given the cost and time required for direct methods of measuring soil moisture the development of artificial intelligence methods can be pursued with more enthusiasm in the future the forecast horizon of the present study was limited to daily while for agricultural planning and irrigation applications real time forecasts such as hourly scale are required another limitation is the consideration of other types of artificial intelligent models other models need to be evaluated as hybrids to estimate soil moisture in different climates also compare the ability of hybrid models against reported emerging approaches e g deep learning based long short term memory lstm model each of these limitations can be investigated independently in another study and this will be a future direction for researchers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9757,soil moisture content smc prediction can contribute to diverse geo science engineering applications such as plantation crops production and several irrigation activities although there have been several methodologies introduced for the sms estimation methods are still associated with challenges and limitations e g time consuming high cost and the need for large data sets in the current research the motivation was inspired to develop new data intelligence models that are capable to estimate smc accurately and reliably several hybridized adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system nf models were developed the feasibility of four meta heuristic algorithms including the gray wolf optimization gwo bee algorithm ba firefly algorithm fa and imperialistic competitive algorithm ica were used to improve the predictability performance of the nf model the performances of the hybrid models were tested at two different climate characteristics i e humid and arid and four different soil depths 5 10 20 and 50 cm the dataset used in this study were consisted of ten years with daily scale practical inputs predictors for the prediction matrix were identified using the mutual information method mi and correlation coefficient which included maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation and soil temperature k fold technique and various indices were used to evaluate hybrid models despite the promising results of all developed models the nf fa is superior to the others in both climates the average results of all depths in humid climate using correlation coefficient r mean absolute percentage error mape and scattering index si were 0 924 6 089 and 0 074 respectively while in the arid climate nf fa model attained 0 903 14 439 and 0 176 in r mape and si respectively the evaluation of different depths and climates showed that nf fa yielded the best accuracy within humid climates and depths of 20 and 10 cm had the lowest estimation error in humid and arid climates this study introduced the fa algorithm as an efficient tool in nf development to estimate smc by readily available inputs without knowing soil physical parameters graphical abstract ga1 keywords adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system meta heuristic algorithms mutual information soil moisture content 1 introduction 1 1 research background soil moisture content smc is considered as a significant component in the hydrological cycle affects the soil s physical and chemical processes and plays an important role in the environment hydrological patterns and climate change badía et al 2017 kumar et al 2018 smc is an influential factor in developing the sustainable agricultural management practices tian et al 2017 this is because by determining the exact status of soil moisture in the fields more informative decision can be taken for better management of irrigation systems and other geo science applications further having sufficient knowledge on smc at critical crop growth stages is essential to improve crop yield save water and overall cost savings greaves and wang 2017 holzman et al 2018 kang et al 2017 despite advances in technology smc measurement and estimation techniques face limitations zhu et al 2013 these methods include on site measurement remote sensing and physical and mathematical models peng et al 2017 smc on site measurements are time consuming and not cost effective in terms of installation calibration and maintenance issues on the other hand satellites and remote sensing for smc estimation seem suitable for increasing spatial coverage however satellites can provide accurate estimates of smc if the area is far from the ocean and lake and the smc is considered a few centimeters above the ground 1 5 cm mahfouf 2010 yang et al 2017 other factors that increase uncertainty of satellite results include dew soil roughness radiant fog and vegetation water content mahfouf 2010 on the other hand physical models suffer from the multiplicity of variables required which may not be suitable for application at the local scales prasad et al 2018a i e the waterdyn model uses meteorological variables including precipitation radiation minimum and maximum temperatures as well as various climatic maps of albedo soil characteristics and seasonality of vegetation greenness to estimate smc raupach et al 2009 2012 mathematical models are common methodologies for estimating smc especially through linear regression models nawar et al 2014 xu et al 2016 however linear regression models need modification because the relationship between effective parameters and soil characteristic features rarely obeys a linear relationship hence the motivation to explore new emerging technologies that can be sufficiently adapted for smc estimation is the motive recently directed matei et al 2017 also the variation in the smc and the different climatic features emphasize the establishment of more generalized technology capable of mimicking the actual soil characteristics cai et al 2019 1 2 artificial intelligent models literature review artificial intelligent ai is one of the recommended tools in the category of computer aid models that can be used in practice by saving both time and cost riahi et al 2021 despite advances in smc measurement procedures the constraints of achieving accurate results are a significant challenge ai techniques have been utilized successfully in soil and water parameters simulations i e soil erosion yavari et al 2018 soil moisture prasad et al 2018b irrigation systems maroufpoor et al 2019c seyedzadeh et al 2020 actual evapotranspiration and crop yield babaee et al 2021 elbeltagi et al 2020 jing et al 2019 kisi 2016 muhammad et al 2021 and water quality and quantity parameters jamei et al 2020 maroufpoor 2020b maroufpoor et al 2017 most of these studies have evaluated stand alone ai methods that face inherent constraints in generalization as a preliminary concern of their applicability as a matter of fact ai models are based on internal optimization parameters tuning bayatvarkeshi et al 2021 yaseen 2021 those parameters are the main influential elements on the learning processes of machine learning models to address this constraint researchers have proposed the use of optimization based on meta heuristic algorithms for solving this problem and several domains on hydrology and climatology have been evidenced their capacity maroufpoor et al 2019a naganna et al 2019 tao et al 2018 tikhamarine et al 2019 2020a another primary concern for implementing machine learning models is the inability to manage inputs parameters for the prediction matrix afan et al 2020 karandish and šimůnek 2016 this can be explained by the association of the non stationarity and non linearity features for the current study soil moisture content and meteorological variables are naturally non stationary that cause non linearities non normality and asymmetric cycles wu et al 2011 hence to identify patterns and non stationary features it is necessary to use data processing techniques to improve model training 1 3 research motivation and objectives based on the reported literature review studies this research was intended to propose new emerging technology of data intelligent model for smc the current investigation does not aim to replicate only the evaluation results of predictability performance of ai models it extends a superior approach without previous concerns in estimating smc at low cost including time labor and money the objectives of the present study are to address the limitations mentioned above hence the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system nf model was selected as a popular ai model in time series estimation kisi et al 2021 malik et al 2019 maroufpoor et al 2019b that combines fuzzy logic with an artificial neural network for the purpose of initiating more robust machine learning model four meta heuristic algorithms including the gray wolf optimization gwo bee algorithm ba firefly algorithm fa and imperialistic competitive algorithm ica were integrated with nf the ability of hybrid models against each other and stand alone models was then assessed therefore it is necessary to compare the algorithms according to the target parameter in the problems the k fold technique was employed to identify various input patterns and non stationary features to ensure the ability of the proposed approaches two wet and dry climate zones north carolina and nevada county in the usa as well as four different depths 5 10 20 and 50 cm were selected on a daily scale the minimum number of inputs was used for the proposed techniques so that these techniques have the potential for practical application at the local scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system nf the concept of fuzzy inference was first introduced in 1965 zadeh 1965 a fuzzy inference system fis is a base rule system based on observational data nf is a combination of fuzzy systems and artificial neural networks that can deal with uncertainty and noise the fuzzy part determines the relationship between the input and output of the model in the fuzzy part the most important role is played by membership functions the parameters of which are regulated by neural network training algorithms there are five layers in the nf structure the first layer performs the fuzzy process of inputs and determines the extent to which each input belongs to different fuzzy intervals kisi and yaseen 2019 the second layer shows the weight of each rule which is obtained by multiplying each node s input values sharafati et al 2020 the third layer normalizes the weight of the rules relative to each other in the fourth layer the output of each rule is calculated and in the final layer the output of the fuzzy system is determined by summing the outputs of the fourth layer factors influencing the nf structure include the type of input and output membership functions mf the method of optimizing mf parameters and the number of iterations the fuzzy inference style used in this study is sugeno back propagation and least squares methods were selected to optimize mf parameters input and output membership functions were considered triangular and constant with trial and error more details about the nf model are available in jang 1993 in this study to increase the nf capability four optimization algorithms including gwo fa ba and ica were used to optimize the parameters of the nf structure the flowchart of which is shown in fig 1 2 2 meta heuristic algorithms 2 2 1 firefly algorithm fa the firefly algorithm fa was proposed by yang 2010 the bioluminescence connection between fireflies inspires the main idea of this algorithm fa is in the category of swarm intelligence algorithms that the cooperation and competition of simple and low intelligence members create a higher level of intelligence yang and he 2013 the fa algorithm is based on the following rules 1 all fireflies are bisexual and regardless of gender one firefly absorbs all other fireflies 2 the degree of attractiveness of a firefly is proportional to its brightness brightness may also decrease with increasing distance from other fireflies however if there is the no brighter firefly then the movement will be random 3 the value of the cost function determines the brightness or light intensity of a firefly fa is a population based evolutionary algorithm inspired by the behavior of fireflies in search of food and their population intelligence in nature fireflies move randomly and each ﬁreﬂy finds a better prey and emits more light to attract other members the greater the distance between the two fireflies the lower their absorption percentage in other words distance is inversely related to speed and absorption the two essential parts of fa include changes in light intensity and moving toward a lighter firefly if n fireflies are selected in the search space the cost function brightness of each firefly is as follows yang 2010 1 i i f x i 0 i n where i i is the brightness of each particle each firefly and x i is the position of the ith particle it is also the absorption function given in eq 2 2 β r β 0 e γ r 2 where β 0 is the absorption rate per zero distance r 0 and γ is the absorption coefficient the movement of particle i with position xi towards particle j with more light and position xj is as follows 3 x i t 1 x i t β r x j x i where xi t 1 is the position of the particle i at time t 1 fa performance is entirely dependent on initial population size iteration and absorption coefficient the higher the light absorption coefficient the greater the convergence of the particles in this study the number of iteration the initial population of fireflies and the absorption coefficient were in the ranges of 400 850 35 50 and 1 5 3 5 respectively which were determined by trial and error based on the lowest error 2 2 2 imperialist competitive algorithm ica the ica algorithm was introduced in 2007 as a new approach to modeling based on socio political relationships atashpaz gargari and lucas 2007 in the ica the phenomenon of colonialism is recognized as an integral part of human historical evolution like other evolutionary algorithms the ica starts with random primary populations each of which is called a country some of these countries will be empires and the rest will be colonized the strongest countries will be the imperialist for the initial division of the colonies among the imperialists each imperialist is assigned several colonies commensurate with their power the power of an empire depends on the two constituent parts of the empire the imperialist state and its colonies mathematically this relation is represented as the sum of the power of the imperialist country plus a percentage of the average power of its colonies with the initial formation of empires imperialist competition begins between them in this competition the imperialist who has less power than the other imperialists loses one of his colonies in this process the weakest colony of the weakest empire randomly joins another empire if an imperialist loses all its colonies it becomes a colony talatahari et al 2012 therefore the survival of an empire depends on its power to absorb the colonies of competitor empires during the imperialist competition the power of the larger empires will gradually increase and the weaker empires will collapse over time from the beginning of the algorithm the colonies move continuously and convergence occurs as the colonies move toward the imperialist some colonies may achieve a better position than the imperialist based on the objective function in this situation the position of the imperialist and the colony are switched and the algorithm continues with the new imperialist country the algorithm stops when a single empire is created with colonies very close to the imperialist country of course other stop conditions such as a certain number of iterations may cause the algorithm to stop in this study based on trial and error the number of countries empires and iterations were determined in the ranges of 100 300 5 10 and 1000 1500 respectively the steps of the ica algorithm are shown in fig 2 2 2 3 bee algorithm ba ba was first developed based on the life and behavior of bees karaboga and basturk 2007 each bee colony consists of three groups of bees each of which has specific responsibilities scout bees are the first group whose task is to discover food sources these bees are randomly scattered around the hive in different distances and directions and search for food after returning to the hive the pioneer bees share their information with other hive bees in a waggle dance after sharing information the second group of bees called the employed bee exploits the food source discovered onlooker bees make up the third group of bees in a hive these bees wait for other bees inside the hive and after exchanging information in a spin dance select a food source that is more valuable than other sources to be exploited in the bee algorithm each food source is a possible solution to the optimization issue also the amount of nectar in food sources indicates the quality of the solution the number of food sources i 1 2 3 n in this algorithm is a fraction of the number of scout bees evaluation of nectar information from food sources is done by the onlooker bees based on the following equation karaboga and basturk 2007 4 p i f i t i i 1 n f i t i 0 i n where pi is the probability of choosing the food source of i fiti the degree of competence and quality of the solution of i n is the number of food sources if the amount of nectar from the proposed source is more significant than the previous source stored in the bee s memory the new position is held and the previous position is forgotten otherwise the previous position is maintained if a solution does not improve after a certain number of iterations in the ba algorithm it is considered an abandoned food source effective parameters in ba include the number of cycles number of scout bees and ratio of feed source to scout bees in the present study these parameters were determined by trial and error based on model improvement in the range of 1000 1500 number of cycles 35 70 number of bees and 0 5 2 ratio of food source to number of bees the algorithm s convergence increased with these parameters and achieving the optimal solution was associated with a minor error 2 2 4 gray wolf optimizer gwo the gwo algorithm is an optimization approach inspired by wolves nature and social behavior when hunting prey mirjalili et al 2014 gwo is population based and has a simple configuration structure that can be easily generalized to large scale problems the hierarchy in gray wolves lives is stringent and includes four types of wolves alpha α beta β delta δ and omega ω the social life of gray wolves is in packs of 5 12 wolves each with its individual tasks the leader is chosen from the alpha wolves and the beta wolves are known as their deputy therefore beta wolves are prone to alpha replacement alpha wolves despite being leaders do not have the most power but they have the highest level of management delta wolves are known as retired old wolves as well as sentries the lowest right to interfere in the pack belongs to omega wolves they even eat after all and do not participate in the decision making process the main steps for hunting gray wolves are tracking and approaching pushing and encircling and attacking respectively in gwo the optimization process is performed by three solutions alpha beta and delta the rest of the solutions are considered omega in other words alpha beta and delta estimate the hunting position and other wolves randomly update their position in the area around the prey determining the initial population and the number of iterations are the main parameters in this algorithm that were selected by trial and error in the intervals of 30 50 and 1000 respectively more details of the algorithm structure can be surveyed through the literature review maroufpoor et al 2020a tikhamarine et al 2020b 2 3 data pre processing 2 3 1 data description and study area in this study data from the us climate reference network uscrn were used uscrn was established by the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa two stations including asheville a station and mercury b station in north carolina and nevada having different climatic contexts were selected to evaluate the models fig 3 station a s latitude longitude and altitude are 35 42 82 56 and 641 m respectively also for station b latitude 36 62 longitude 116 02 and altitude are 1001 m according to the international energy conservation code iecc ellis 2014 the states of north carolina and nevada have humid 5b and arid 3a climatic conditions fig 3b the noaa research team described the method of measuring soil moisture content at different depths bell et al 2013 daily data covering a ten years period 2020 2011 were selected to assess the developed methodology typically when ai models are applied the feeding patterns are divided into two training and testing or three training validation and testing parts e g held out method this process increases the bias in estimation further by adopting held out methods the model can t learn all the successive patterns in this study the k fold cross validation technique was used to cover all successive time patterns in the model s training therefore the data were divided into ten folds 10 years and each year was evaluated at least once in the test section the use of five folds or more is recommended to reduce the estimated bias rodriguez et al 2009 also increases the number of folds reduces the variance magnitudes and the risk of over fitting shao 1993 the available data included maximum and minimum air temperature tmax tmin c maximum and minimum relative humidity rhmax rhmin precipitation p mm solar radiation sr mj m 2 soil moisture smc m3 m 3 and soil temperature st c at four depths 5 10 20 and 50 cm the statistical characteristics of the data are presented in table 1 there is a significant difference between the statistical indices of the two stations soil moisture precipitation and relative humidity in station a have higher mean values than station b however other parameters have a higher mean in station b the highest coefficient of variation in both stations was related to the precipitation parameter based on the standard deviation of the data the highest deviation from the mean values at station a and b was the minimum and maximum relative humidity parameters respectively the results of statistical properties confirm the different climates of the two stations 2 3 2 sensitivity analysis and input selection strategy the first step in this section was to calculate the pearson correlation coefficient at stations a and b fig 4 as can be seen from the figure p has the lowest correlation with soil moisture at both locations while the soil temperature for each depth showed the highest inverse correlation solar radiation and maximum and minimum temperatures also showed slight correlations the low correlation values are due to the nonlinear relationship of soil moisture with other variables the second step was to perform sensitivity analysis with the mutual information method mi mi is derived from the concept of entropy which is a measure of uncertainty and randomness cover and thomas 1991 the mi between two variables x and y was calculated based on the following equation cover and thomas 1991 5 mi y x g y g x g y x where mi y x is mutual information between y and x g y is the entropy of y g x is the entropy of x and g y x is joint entropy which are defined as 6 g y y y p y log p y 7 g x x x p x log p x 8 g y x y y x x p y x log p y x where p y and p x are the marginal probabilities of y and x and p y x is the joint probability the results of mi for both stations are presented in fig 5 almost the st at each depth showed the most mutual information followed by tmax tmin and sr as expected p is associated with high uncertainty and low mi finally it can be concluded that the correlation coefficient and mutual information refer to the soil temperature variables for each depth solar radiation and maximum and minimum temperature these variables were also recommended by prasad et al 2018a to estimate soil moisture and therefore were selected as practical inputs here as well 2 4 performance assessment indicators a comprehensive assessment is needed to understand the models ability to estimate here models at each station were compared based on pearson correlation coefficient r willmott s index wi mean absolute percentage error mape and uncertainty with 95 confidence level u95 ehteram et al 2021 yaseen 2021 r is a non dimensional index that quantifies the relationship between estimated and observed values but it is not reliable for evaluation because the model with low estimation accuracy can have a high correlation the advantage of wi is to identify differences in mean and variance between estimated and observed values the scatter index si was used to compare the performance of the models between the two stations si is a scale independent indicator that evaluates based on relative error the ideal values for r and wi are one and zero for u95 mape and si the equations of the indicators are as follows 9 r i 1 n o i o e i e i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n e i e 2 10 w i 1 i 1 n o i e i 2 i 1 n e i o i o i o i 2 11 m a p e 1 n i 1 n o i p i o i 100 12 u 95 1 96 s d 2 1 n i 1 n o i e i 2 2 13 s i 1 n i 1 n o i e i 2 o where o i e i o and e are ith smc values of the observed and estimated average values of observed and estimated respectively also sd and n represent the standard deviation of estimation error and number of records 3 application results and analysis 3 1 humid climate station a the statistical indicators and the architecture of the models at all studied depths have been presented in table 2 for both the studied locations the structure and parameters set in this table for each model were described in the materials and methods section for depth of 5 cm the nf fa5 on account of r 0 943 wi 0 975 and mape 9 429 was superior to other hybrid models followed by nf ica5 r 0 938 nf gwo5 r 0 937 nf ba5 r 0 905 and nf r 0 901 respectively comparing the mape values exhibited that the nf fa5 and nf ba5 models by reducing 28 and 4 5 against nf had the best and weakest performance in estimating smc at depth of 5 cm respectively besides fig 6 a demonstrates the scatter plots of all models for smc estimation at 5 cm in the humid climate station a it can be seen that the predicted smc values obtained by the nf fa5 have better agreement with the observational data sets whereas the nf ica5 and nf gwo5 are stood in the second and third ranks respectively fig 7 depicts the probability distribution function of error values based on maximum minimum q25 median and q75 indices for all predictive models in four considered depths of soil at humid climate station a according to fig 7 a nf fa5 due to having a minimum interquartile range iqr q3 q1 of 0 031 yielded the most promising results compared to the other models the statistical indices for depth of 10 cm reported in table 2 showed that the nf fa10 owing to highest r 0 946 and wi 0 973 and lowest diagnostic error mape 6 687 provided the best performance accuracy for estimation of smc computationally it might be stated that nf fa10 nf gwo10 and nf ica10 by 30 26 6 and 18 5 improvement of mape in the nf10 model are identified as the best predictors respectively moreover fig 6 b showed that the data points obtained from the nf fa10 model are concentrated around the identity line and have a more logical fit and consistency than other hybrid models however the nf gwo10 and nf ica10 models also had slightly similar accuracy to the nf fa10 method and yielded reliable precision to estimate smc at 10 cm of soil furthermore fig 7 b illustrated that nf fa10 iqr 0 023 nf gwo10 iqr 0 026 and nf ica10 iqr 0 029 efficiently improved the accuracy of modeling smc at 10 cm of soil by 34 26 and 17 compared to the stand alone nf10 model the predictive capabilities assessment of the models presented to predict the smc at the 20 cm of soil exhibits the superiority of the nf fa20 model regarding r 0 966 and mape 3 785 compared to nf gwo20 r 0 962 nf ica20 r 0 957 and nf20 r 0 919 on one hand the scatter plots of fig 6 c confirmed more agreement between the estimated and observational smc data points using nf fa20 however the recorded error estimation of the results generated by the respective approaches clearly proved that the nf fa20 with minimum values of iqr 0 0153 and error band 0 1273 led to the most precise outcomes among all provided models evaluation of the statistical metrics and graphical tools belong to the ai models for predicting the smc values at the 50 cm of soil demonstrated more efficiency of nf fa50 with respect to higher r 0 870 and lower iqr error estimation 0 870 than the other hybrid nf models however the efficiency of all the models at this depth 50 cm is significantly less than other depths of modeling according to distributed pattern owing to predicted data points see figs 6 d and 7 d to compare the performance of the proposed models and examine their predictability potential the uncertainty u95 values for each model at the four depths are shown in fig 8 it is clear crystal that the nf fa model regarding the lowest u95 for various depths 0 0728 for 5 cm 0 0553 for 10 cm 0 0364 for 20 cm and 0 0542 for 50 cm was identified as the most efficient models followed by nf gwo nf ica nf ba and stand alone nf models nf gwo model is in the second rank in terms of accuracy this model has also been previously evaluated in estimating soil moisture and had promising results maroufpoor et al 2019a also the best accurate results for predicting smc of soil were obtained in the depth of 20 cm u95 0 0364 among all examined situations 3 2 arid climate station b sophisticated metrics and graphical validation tools conducted the ability assessment of the provided ai model in station b with arid climate according to table 2 the results belong to the depth of 5 cm proved that the nf fa5 model by the optimal statistical criteria r 0 934 wi 0 984 and mape 18 93 outperformed the nf ica5 r 0 930 and mape 19 844 nf wgo5 r 0 9325 and mape 22 444 nf ba5 r 0 909 and mape 27 112 and nf r 0 909 and mape 27 112 respectively however for this situation the predictive performance of nf fa5 and nf ica5 was closed to each other fig 9 demonstrated the performance comparison between estimated and observational smc values for all considering soil depths in the arid climate scenario station b regarding fig 9 a the superiority of nf fa5 is evident based on the perfect distribution pattern around the 1 1 line compared to other hybrid models as the nf ba5 and nf were farther away than the observational dataset for a better assessment of the efficiency of provided models the estimated error distribution in form of box plots is shown in fig 10 per fig 10 a the quartile error metric proved the acceptable precision of the nf fa5 and nf ica5 on account of minimum iqr of 0 00684 and 0 0093 smc at the 5 cm of depth the robustness of the models at a depth of 10 cm shows that the nf fa10 can show better performance than other methods due to the highest accuracy based on r 0 92 and mape 11 173 while the nf ica10 r 0 916 and nf wgo10 r 0 15 were as good as the nf fa10 in terms of accuracy fig 9 b confirmed that the three aforementioned models are more accurate than the nf ba10 and nf10 models regarding the diagnostic metric i e q25 q75 min max and median nf fa10 nf gwo10 and nf ica10 decreased the error of the nf10 model by 18 6 12 3 and 8 7 values respectively fig 9 b finally the robustness of the hybrid models in comparison stand alone nf for modeling the smc of soil at 50 cm as the previously concluded outcome from the diverse depths clearly confirmed the superiority of nf fa50 strategy owing to the best r 0 826 wi 0 946 and mape 14 099 against nf gwo50 r 0 718 nf ica50 r 0 717 nf ba50 r 0 643 and nf50 r 0 552 although the obtained results in this situation were not as well as the 5 cm 10 cm and 20 cm depths of soil fig 9 d depicted the estimated smc values compared to the observational data sets where the agreement of estimated outcomes with the line of 45 is not perfect and ideal besides in accordance with fig 10 d the nf fa50 and nf ica50 on the basis of q25 0 0043 and q75 0 00437 and q25 0 0045 and q75 0 0050 outperformed the other models for a general assessment of the ai approaches at the various depths in station b fig 11 demonstrated the uncertainty values in form of a bar plot it is clear crystal that the lowest values of u95 have occurred at the depth of 20 cm and the best predictive performance belongs to the nf fa model which was able to improve the accuracy based on u95 of the stand alone nf model with 22 2 18 3 30 and 40 8 for 5 cm 10 cm 20 cm 50 cm depths of the soil respectively the stand alone nf model is known as one of the efficient models in estimating soil water capacity parameters shiri et al 2017 which was developed in this research with meta heuristic algorithms 3 3 performance comparison of the models the main purpose of this section is to compare the performance of the models presented in the humid and arid climates in estimating the amount of smc fig 12 exhibited the radar plots of the si index for two explored climates in four depths of soil confidently it can be concluded that the si values green line belong to the humid climate are lower than those of the arid climate red line which implied that all models for the humid climate are more promising than the arid one furthermore nf fa due to minimum values of si in all the depths and all studied climates was identified as the best paradigm for the estimation of smc in addition the best outcomes for humid scenario station a are related to 20 cm depth of soil in term of si nf fa 0 0483 whereas for the arid scenario station b belongs to 10 cm depth of soil with si nf fa 0 01389 generally through prior discussions can be concluded that the nf gwo nf ica and nf ba stood in the next best ranks as the efficient predictor alternative for modeling the smc in both inspected climates it is noteworthy that the least accuracy in both scenarios station a and station b was related to the results obtained at the 50 cm of depth and smc modeling at this depth was not very satisfactory even for hybrid ai approaches eventually fig 13 shows the trend plot of developed models where the nf fa had the best performance in each climate at the 20 cm of soil in station a and at the 10 cm of soil in station b respectively the zones that have the highest oscillations were magnified to better examine the model s ability to capture the non linearity of smc time series in the below of each trend plot the upper panel of fig 13 between 160 and 1800 days showed that nf fa at station a has the superior performance in estimating smc followed by nf ica and nf gwo respectively besides the lower panel of fig 13 similarly exhibited the better predictive performance of nf fa at station b than the other models moreover the nf gwo and nf ica stood in the next ranks whereas the stand alone nf model was the disappointing accuracy in both climates and all the depths of soil 4 discussion and possible future research the applied predictive models have shown the significant hybridized ml models potential in solving the smc problem the integration of the optimization algorithms has substantially improved the predictability performance of the nf model also the applied predictive models behaved differently for the selected climate regions as the climate characteristic remarkably influenced the data stochasticity also it is worth that smc for each depth attained varied estimation accuracy that clearly explains the complexity of the smc as various geo science factors are affecting the different smc depths however the predictive models especially nf fa revealed superior estimation performance in this study nf performance was improved by meta heuristic algorithms maroufpoor et al 2019a also improved nf performance with the gwo algorithm to estimate soil moisture and compared the results with artiﬁcial neural network ann and support vector regression svr models the nf gwo model performed better than the other two models this result was also proved in this study because nf gwo was one of the top models moosavi et al 2016 also studied the hybrid model of nf particle swarm optimization pso and svr pso to estimate soil moisture which svr pso was superior to nf pso previous research shows that it is not appropriate to choose a general model and algorithm for estimating soil moisture content because the results will be different for each region and site in this regard chaudhary et al 2021 assessed 12 machine learning models to estimate soil moisture and confirmed the superiority of three models nf random forest rf and subtractive clustering sbc based on the reported research results it is worth to mention the validity of the data span based on the estimation attained by the developed hybrid ml models it is clearly can be notice that the data span was sufficient enough to build the learning process of the network of the intelligent model the next step of the current research can be devoted on the feasibility to developed intelligent expert system that can be beneficial more in the practical aspects future research can be devoted on developing and designing up to date smc data sampling based on advanced federated learning fl technology the functionality of the fl can be tested for more practical smc detection and monitoring the expected system is fundamentally constructed based on distributed network architecture and smart internet of thing iot sensors system edge servers and centralized could for fl aggregation fig 14 the first phase consisted of several sensors to collect the smc data and transmits to the second phase where the edge server gathers all the information to be supplied to the predictive model the third phase comprised the fl process that is communicated the modeling results with centralized cloud the fl centralized cloud initiate the update for the global model prediction the advantage of this model is to have more informative intelligence model that can be practically contribute to the decision making of the related environmental engineering 5 conclusion this study was a step in the development and advancement of smc estimation techniques for this purpose four meta heuristic algorithms including gwo ba fa and ica were integrated with the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system nf model the sensitivity analysis of the inputs was performed by mutual information method mi and correlation matrix finally the maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation and soil temperature were selected as practical inputs in estimating smc two humid and arid climates and four different depths including 5 10 20 and 50 cm were evaluated to ensure the application of the proposed models the results showed that the fa algorithm is an efficient tool in developing nf in both climates depths of 20 and 10 cm showed the lowest estimation error values in humid and arid stations respectively by comparing the performance of the models in the two climates it was found that the estimation of smc in humid climates is associated with a lower relative error index si the nf gwo and nf ica models also had promising results after the nf fa despite extensive research in soil moisture estimation the hybrid models of the present study except nf gwo have not yet been evaluated in soil moisture estimation having promising performance in two different climates was another strength of the proposed models to ensure the applicability of the proposed models and their development in different climates and depths it is necessary to evaluate these models in other conditions and regions however this process requires resetting the model parameters given the cost and time required for direct methods of measuring soil moisture the development of artificial intelligence methods can be pursued with more enthusiasm in the future the forecast horizon of the present study was limited to daily while for agricultural planning and irrigation applications real time forecasts such as hourly scale are required another limitation is the consideration of other types of artificial intelligent models other models need to be evaluated as hybrids to estimate soil moisture in different climates also compare the ability of hybrid models against reported emerging approaches e g deep learning based long short term memory lstm model each of these limitations can be investigated independently in another study and this will be a future direction for researchers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9758,a field experiment was conducted in 2017 and 2018 to investigate the responses of fine root growth and morphology plasticity to drip irrigation and nitrogen fertigation dif in a young triploid p tomentosa plantation in the north china plain we monitored four dif treatments i20f0 i20fh i45f0 i45fh which were the combinations of two irrigation thresholds 20 kpa and 45 kpa denoted as i20 and i45 and two n fertigation amounts 0 denoted as f0 220 and 260 kg n ha 1 year 1 in 2017 and 2018 denoted as fh some soil properties and aboveground growth parameters were also monitored i20 significantly improved fine root biomass density frbd by 156 92 and induced a significant reduction of specific root length srl by 28 79 in 0 30 cm soil layers than i45 and fh significantly decreased fine root length density 62 88 surface area 54 01 and srl 39 01 in 30 80 cm soil layers than f0 in 2017 fine root traits differed little among dif treatments in 0 30 cm soil layers in 2018 but i20 significantly improved frbd by 259 98 than i45 and fh significantly improved fine root averaged diameter by 67 14 in 30 80 cm soil layers than f0 these suggested that fine root had a conservative foraging strategy in water and nitrogen rich conditions all the trait plasticity might be due to the changeable soil properties i e soil water content organic matter nitrate and ammonium nitrogen and total phosphorus based on the little difference of fine root mass among dif treatments in two years we hold the view that fine root distribution pattern and some growth and morphological traits adapted to water nitrogen heterogeneity more easily than the mass plasticity in young aged p tomentosa plantations yet enhancing our understanding of fine root foraging strategy in response to dif practices and how it affects tree growth requires more attention to some physiological and biochemical processes and the growth dynamics of the root systems key words fine root morphology vertical distribution soil property drip irrigation fertigation poplar 1 introduction fine roots play a crucial role in forest carbon nutrient and water cycles it is a major reservoir of carbon and the production accounts for up to 75 of the net primary production in mature forests gill and jackson 2000 norby and jackson 2000 finér et al 2011 as the most active part of the root system fine roots are responsible for water and nutrient acquisition gordon and jackson 2000 wang and guo 2008 wang et al 2017 they have evolved a range of belowground strategies for resource acquisition such as modifying biomass allocation growth and morphology plasticity and physiological and biotic root traits bardgett et al 2014 under the background of global warming and n deposition previous studies have illustrated the general enhancement of fine root production in n limited temperate forests and the growth trait in some water deficient conditions nadelhoffer 2000 majdi and andersson 2005 zou et al 2019 however how fine roots respond to water nitrogen changeable conditions in artificial forests especially in the young aged stand remains poorly understood fine root has high growth and morphology trait plasticity for resource acquisition eissenstat 2000 bardgett et al 2014 kou et al 2015 functional equilibrium hypothesis and resource economics theory were well recognized for root foraging strategy trees either use an extensive strategy to invest resources for root growth or an intensive strategy to sustain growth by root morphological adaptions i e higher specific root length and root surface area under stress conditions eissenstat and yanai 1997 ostonen et al 2007a several opposing views still existed that might attribute to the specific species and genotypes the characteristics of the study site tree growth stage and the diverse forest management scarce studies focused on root foraging strategy in the artificial poplar forests therefore it is necessary to find out the specific resource foraging strategy under drip irrigation and nitrogen fertigation dif treatments in the young aged poplar plantations to improve the cultivation techniques of triploid populus tomentosa in the future fine roots absorb water and nutrients for photosynthesis and leaves provide them with hydrocarbon products in return wright et al 2004 the knowledge of fine root biomass at the individual tree level and its relationships with leaves and stem growth aboveground is still scarce zhou et al 2018 previous studies have demonstrated the economic trade offs between leaf and root in some chemical structural and physiological properties weemstra et al 2016 the organ biomass allocation patterns of p tomentosa plantations were also testified by the allometric growth equations or the dirichlet regression model to some extent poorter and sack 2012 wang et al 2015 he et al 2020 however the specific leaf root relationships with the stand growth in young aged p tomentosa plantations remain rudimentary poplar is one of the fast growing commercial species widely planted in the north china plain perry et al 2001 dickmann 2006 he et al 2020 innovations in irrigation and fertigation techniques usually focus on optimizing timing wetting patterns and irrigation fertigation intensity to increase resource use efficiency dai 2019 dif was an effective practice applied in artificial forest cultivation to improve resource utilization efficiency nowadays li et al 2003 yan et al 2016 he et al 2020 previous studies have investigated some fine root dynamics and morphology traits of poplars under drip irrigated systems zhang et al 2013 yan et al 2019 zou et al 2019 however rare studies focus on the effects of both water and nitrogen supply on fine root traits under dif practices much less about their interactions furthermore it is of great importance to figure out the mechanisms of fine root adaption and foraging strategies under dif treatments in such a typical stand to guide the long term cultivation of poplars the objective of this study was to figure out fine root growth and morphological plasticity in response to dif treatments in young aged p tomentosa plantations in the north china plain the relationship between tree growth and the resource acquisition organs i e leaf root was also explored to achieve these goals we monitored fine root growth and morphological traits i e fine root biomass density frbd fine root length density frld fine root surface area frsa specific root length srl fine root averaged diameter frad and fine root tissue density frtd beneath the dripper and measured the soil properties of the corresponding soil layers besides total fine root biomass leaf biomass and the tree basal area in different dif treatments were also monitored in 2 and 3 year old stand 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design this study was conducted in a state owned forest farm near qingping town gaotang county shandong province 36 48 46 n 116 05 24 e northern china this area is a typical yellow river alluvial plain and features a warm temperate monsoon climate the basic information is as follows elevation 30 m annual average temperature 13 2 c average annual rainfall 544 7 mm mainly in july and august average frost free period about 204 days free water surface evaporation 1880 mm he et al 2021 the soil is a sandy loam with a ph of 8 42 and the total nitrogen n mineral n available phosphorus p available potassium k and organic matter om were 0 23 g kg 1 2 62 mg kg 1 4 92 mg kg 1 71 33 mg kg 1 and 3 34 g kg 1 in 0 80 cm soil layers detailed information of soil physical and chemical properties has been presented in he et al 2021 the experimental plantation was planted from 2 year old stem cuttings of a triploid p tomentosa clone clone s86 p tomentosa p bolleana p alba p glandulosa spaced at 2 m 3 m intervals in april 2016 the average height and diameter at breast height dbh of the seedlings were 3 30 m and 2 68 cm respectively the base fertilizer was an organic inorganic compound fertilizer which contained more than 15 organic matter and the proportion of total n phosphorus pentoxide and potassium oxide were 14 12 and 5 respectively we applied 70 g base fertilizer per tree during afforestation a surface drip irrigation system was installed in the experimental field in october 2016 drip irrigation and nitrogen fertigation dif experiment was initiated in april 2017 as a randomized block experimental design consisting of 5 replicate blocks encompassing total 65 plots briefly each block contained 13 plots including 1 untreated control non irrigation and non fertigation and 12 dif treatments combinations of 3 irrigation thresholds and 4 n fertigation amounts different irrigation thresholds were designed based on our previous study of the quantitative relationship between poplar growth and soil water availability in the growing season xi et al 2016 2017 and the soil properties of our experimental site consequently irrigation was initiated when the average soil matric potential at 20 cm soil depth under the dripper reached 20 kpa 79 of field capacity and 73 of soil water availability 33 kpa 67 of field capacity and 57 of soil water availability and 45 kpa 60 of field capacity and 48 of soil water availability denoted as i20 i33 and i45 respectively the irrigation amount of i20 i33 and i45 were 3474 151 and 167 m3 ha 1 in 2017 and were 4557 1146 and 0 m3 ha 1 in 2018 the irrigation times of i20 i33 and i45 were 29 1 and 1 in 2017 and were 25 5 and 0 in 2018 details seen in he et al 2020 according to the growth pattern and n absorption characteristics of p tomentosa wang 2015 n fertigation was applied at 0 and 0 80 and 120 150 and 190 220 and 260 kg n ha 1 year 1 in 2017 and 2018 denoted as f0 fl fm and fh respectively n fertigation was applied with a constant urea nitrate solution 233 5 g n l 1 through the drip irrigation system 6 times each year more details about the experimental design were described in he et al 2018 2020 2 2 sampling root traits measurement and growth assessment the sequential coring method was used to sample root for root abundance and morphology in early september in 2017 and 2018 four and three averaged size trees per treatment were selected from i20f0 i20fh i45fh and control plots in four and three blocks in 2017 and 2018 respectively the soil core was taken at 30 cm distance to the trunk and directly underneath the dripper eight and fifteen soil samples were extracted in 0 80 cm and 0 150 cm soil layers with 10 cm depth per sampling core in 2017 and 2018 respectively using the steel soil auger of 5 5 cm internal diameter a total of 308 soil cores were collected the soil cores were placed into plastic bags and then washed gently by running water through sieve nets to get them clean live roots were distinguished from dead roots according to the difference in root shape elasticity and color xi et al 2013 wang et al 2019 fine roots diameter 2 mm were distinguished from coarse roots diameter 2 mm by vernier caliper all live fine roots in 0 80 cm soil layers were transported to the laboratory stored at 20 c and then processed for morphological trait analysis fine root samples in 80 150 cm soil layers in 2018 were directly oven dried for the biomass data the fine root samples in 0 80 cm soil layers were arranged on a transparent plate and scanned using an epson perfection v850 pro scanner at a resolution of 400 dpi roots were then oven dried at 65 c for 48 h and weighted to estimate dry mass scanned images were analyzed for root length root surface area root projected area and root volume using the winrhizo image analysis software regent instruments inc quebec canada fine root biomass density frbd g m 3 fine root length density frld m m 3 and fine root surface area frsa m2 m 3 were calculated as root mass root length and root surface area per soil core volume respectively specific root length srl m g 1 was calculated as root length per unit root dry mass fine root averaged diameter frad mm and fine root tissue density frtd g m 3 was the ratio of total projected area to the total root length and root dry mass to its volume respectively besides total fine root biomass and leaf biomass were obtained from the destructive biomass samplings in the late growing season in i20fh and control treatments in 2017 and in i20f0 i20fh i45fh and control treatments in 2018 details seen in he et al 2020 we also measured dbh of the sampled trees to calculate the stand basal area ba and then calculated fine root biomass per ba as proxies for the relative allocation of absorptive roots ostonen et al 2017 2 3 soil properties soil samples collected from the soil cores by 20 cm intervals in 0 80 cm soil depths in early september in 2017 and 2018 were used to determine soil properties including total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp soil organic matter om nitrate nitrogen no3 n ammonium nitrogen nh4 n soil water content swc and ph we collected fresh soil samples through the 2 mm sieve and then separated them into two subsamples one fresh subsample nearly 60 g was used for no3 n nh4 n and swc analysis approximately 30 g fresh soil was dried in an oven at 105 c to a constant weight to determine swc another one was air dried for om ph tn and tp analysis the fresh subsamples for no3 n and nh4 n measurements were immediately brought back to the laboratory and stored in the refrigerator at 20 c until further analysis extraction of no3 n and nh4 n was conducted with 1 m kcl extracting solution at a liquid soil ratio of 5 1 and processed using standard methods no3 n and nh4 n concentrations mg l 1 were measured by continuous flow injection colorimetry seal analytical aa3 seal analytical gmbh norderstedt germany tn was determined by digestion with concentrated sulphuric perchloric acid and measured using continuous flow injection colorimetry seal analytical aa3 seal analytical gmbh norderstedt germany tp was measured by molybdenum antimony colorimetry om was measured by potassium dichromate volumetric method and soil ph was measured using a standard ph meter mettler toledo switzerland with a soil water ratio of 1 2 5 all measurement methods followed lu 2000 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analysis was conducted using r software r core team 2015 analysis of variance anova was performed for fine root growth and morphological traits with dif treatments irrigation threshold n fertigation amount and soil depths as factors before anovas the data were checked for normality and homogeneity of variances and log transformed to correct deviations from these assumptions when needed tukey s hsd test was used to test differences among treatment means and different soil layers for significance at α 0 05 the relationship between fine root to leaf biomass ratio and basal area was performed by simple regressions pearson s correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the relationships between soil properties and fine root trait variables redundancy analysis rda was conducted to determine the relative importance of soil properties contributing to fine root trait variation we analyzed 4 treatments in 2017 and 2018 i e i20f0 i20fh i45fh and control according to the records of water meter and our previous study on the evaporation of p tomentosa stand xi et al 2017 he et al 2020 the irrigation amount of i45f0 treatment was only 16 7 mm in 2017 which was much less than soil evaporation in non irrigation and non fertigation treatment control besides there was no water supply by dif practice in i45f0 treatment in 2018 so we take control as i45f0 treatment to do data analysis during these two years 3 results 3 1 fine root vertical distribution abundance and morphology fine root abundance frbd frld and morphological trait i e frsa were significantly changed by soil depths in 2017 and 2018 table 1 figs 2 4 the significant interaction between irrigation threshold and soil depth in 2017 indicated the fine root traits throughout the soil profile differed between different irrigation treatments across different treatment the proportion of fine root biomass in 0 30 cm soil layers ranged from 44 1 to 79 2 in 2017 fig 1 a besides i20 associated treatments significantly increased fine root biomass and decreased srl in 0 30 cm surface soil in 2017 table 2 n fertigation amount had a significant effect on some root abundance and morphology traits i e frld frsa srl in 30 80 cm soil layer in 2017 frld frsa and srl of fh treatments decreased by 62 88 54 01 and 39 01 compared with non fertigation treatments respectively fine root distribution pattern changed to some extent in 2018 fig 1 the cumulative frbd in 0 30 cm soil layer was up to 81 26 in i45f0 nearly 28 36 higher than other treatments irrigation threshold and n fertigation amount had little effect on fine root in surface soil in 2018 frbd in i20 treatments was 3 6 fold than that of i45 treatments in 30 80 cm soil layer table 2 fh significantly increased frad in 30 80 cm soil layer there was also a significant interactive effect of irrigation threshold and n fertigation amount on srl in deeper soil 3 2 fine root growth and morphological traits in different soil layers dif treatments had effects on fine root traits mostly in 0 60 cm soil layers in 2017 figs 2 7 frbd frld and frsa were significantly higher in i20f0 treatment than that of i45fh treatment in 0 10 cm soil layer frld and frsa in i45f0 treatment were 4 5 5 fold that of i20fh treatment in 30 40 cm soil layer srl was 72 7 higher in i45f0 treatment than that of high fertigation treatments i e i45fh i20fh in 0 20 cm soil layer in contrast with the relative lower 26 5 frtd in the same soil layer but there was no significant change in root diameter srl in i45f0 was 71 4 higher than that of i45fh in 0 10 cm soil layer and 131 6 higher than that of i20fh in 10 20 cm soil layer respectively there was less effect of dif treatment on fine root traits in different soil layers in 2018 except for the highest frbd in i20fh treatment in 30 40 cm soil layer and the higher frad in i45fh treatment in 50 60 cm soil layer figs 2 6 3 3 fine root growth in response to drip irrigation and nitrogen fertigation the total fine root biomass to leaf biomass ratio significantly decreased with the increment of basal area power function among dif treatments fig 8 it indicated that less fine root was needed to maintain the unit amount of foliage with the aboveground growth there was no significant difference in total fine root biomass among different treatments in the same year 2017 or 2018 as well as the total fine root biomass per basal area table 3 the pearson s correlation coefficients between fine root traits and soil properties indicated that om no3 n and nh4 n were all significantly positively correlated with frbd frld and frsa tp and no3 n were also significantly correlated with frad and frtd there was a significant positive correlation between srl and no3 n table 4 the pearson s correlation was also confirmed by the rda results which demonstrated that om no3 n nh4 n and tp were the best explanatory variables fig 9 they accounted for very significant proportions of the variation in the fine root trait syndromes under different dif regimes the soil properties explained 90 06 of the total variation with axes 1 and 2 explaining 59 17 and 30 89 of the total variation respectively fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 fine root trait plasticity in response to dif practices drip irrigation and nitrogen fertigation dif significantly affected the water and nitrogen distribution patterns in 2017 and 2018 he et al 2018 2021 therefore fine root showed some growth and morphological plasticity under dif treatments during two years differential responses to dif treatments illustrated that fine root had the extensive increased fine root growth and intensive morphological adaptations foraging strategy ostonen et al 2007b 2011 helmisaari et al 2009 it indicated some root parameters had intimate relations with water and nitrogen acquisition such as fine root length biomass surface area and specific root length table 1 root systems are known to show high plasticity in response to genetic variability and environmental conditions based on the phylogenetic conservatism comas et al 2002 kong et al 2014 root diameter and tissue density are less plastic than root length and surface area majdi 2001 leuschner and hertel 2003 ostonen et al 2007a 2007b but frad was still influenced by soil depth and fertigation in our 2 and 3 year old stand table 1 all these showed the high plasticity of fine root growth and morphological traits in young aged p tomentosa stand under dif practices on sandy loam soil plant root patterns could be influenced by irrigation frequency and fertilizer amount sharma et al 2018 hou et al 2019 ma et al 2020 which was consistent with our results to some extent table 2 figs 1 7 the wetting zone was the key area for water and nitrogen supplement under drip irrigation systems li et al 2005 2018 xi et al 2016 especially in the dry growing season he et al 2021 so it might be the reason for frbd increment in shallow soil layers in high irrigation level in the 2 year old stand table 2 zou et al 2019 demonstrated that drip irrigation had less effect on fine root biomass in the 2 year old p tomentosa stand clone b301 but the rooting depth significantly changed to the shallow soil layers in sufficient water conditions the different responses of fine root to soil moisture might be attributed to the intraspecific differences and the variability of weather conditions in different years in contrast with the higher frbd in the high irrigation associated treatments srl significantly decreased in 0 30 cm soil layer in 2017 which was similar to the result by ostonen et al 2007b according to the optimality theory the lower srl indicated a good investment of fine root biomass with less absorptive morphological traits in the resource rich conditions eissenstat and yanai 1997 fertigation had less effect on fine root traits in 0 30 cm soil layers during 2 years though the mineral nitrogen content in surface soil layers was significantly improved by dif treatments he et al 2021 previous studies showed that fertigation also had less effect on the growth of young aged p tomentosa plantations he et al 2020 2021 nevertheless fine root properties were influenced by fertigation in the deeper soil layers to some extent based on our knowledge of water and nitrogen distribution patterns in previous studies fertigation can still improve mineral nitrogen content in 30 80 cm soil layers especially in high fertigation treatments after irrigation and precipitation he et al 2018 2021 frld frsa and srl significantly decreased in 2017 and frad significantly increased in 2018 in fertigation treatments in deeper soil layers table 2 which was also consistent with the resource economics hypothesis that fine roots adopted the relative conservative strategy in nutrient rich soil kong et al 2019 the anovas for the effects of drip irrigation threshold nitrogen fertigation amount soil depth and their interactions on fine root traits were performed in 2017 and 2018 separately table 1 due to the data collection in consecutive two years and the differences of fine root traits among the two years could be easily observed in figs 1 7 the variable weather conditions i e heavy precipitation changed stand growth pattern in 2018 he et al 2021 as well as influenced fine root distribution pattern and growth traits tables 1 2 fig 1 more fine roots concentrated in the shallow soil layers in i45f0 treatment in 2018 and irrigation still had a significant effect on frbd in 30 40 cm soil layer the limitation of soil moisture on sandy loam soil can be alleviated by precipitation and the water stress treatments might adopt an extensive foraging strategy for water acquisition in our young aged stand eissenstat and yanai 1997 ostonen et al 2017 plenty of studies investigated the effect of climate changes on fine root morphology anatomy and carbon allocation verburg et al 2013 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 they found the fine root growth of woody plant was mostly stimulated by precipitation and nitrogen deposition in the semi arid ecosystem because of the limitation of soil moisture and nitrogen availability fertigation still affected some morphological traits in 30 80 cm soil layers in 2018 i e bigger frad and lower srl representing the conservative foraging strategy the heavy precipitation could make a deeper movement of mineral nitrogen under dif treatment in our study site he et al 2021 which could explain the conservative foraging strategy in nutrient rich conditions 4 2 growth and morphological trait syndromes and their correlations with soil properties during two years although dif treatment affected some fine root growth and morphological traits in the specific soil layers figs 2 7 there was no significant difference in the total fine root biomass among different treatments table 3 it illustrated a special root strategy for 2 and 3 year old p tomentosa plantations that is the response of fine root morphological traits to the resource heterogeneity in different soil layers maybe more important than the root mass plasticity weemstra et al 2017 investigated fine root trait plasticity and found that trees showed more changes in fine root mass than in fine root morphology to acquire resources on poor soils and the root shoot ratio increased on the sandy soil conversely our study showed that fine root had more trait plasticity but less mass plasticity in different dif treatments although dif treatments had little effect on fine root mass among two years high irrigation amount or high fertigation amount treatment still altered biomass allocation patterns to some extent he et al 2020 based on the root biomass data in he et al 2020 we inferred that the young aged poplars might invest more carbon to coarse root for the anchorage and transport function to enhance root lifespan and retain resources first and then produce more fine root for resource acquisition in our study site bardgett et al 2014 reich 2014 weemstra et al 2016 considering the relationship between above and belowground organs there was no significant difference in fine root biomass per basal area among different dif treatments during two years though it was higher in 2017 table 3 fig 8 it interpreted the young aged trees might need more fine roots to sustain a certain amount of aboveground growth helmisaari et al 2002 found the 15 year old saplings had a higher fine root proportion than the mature stage of scots pine leuschner et al 2004 and lei et al 2012 also held the view that fine root adaptation strategies might be more pronounced and significant for young trees as large trees had the greater ability to control the internal nutrient and carbohydrate mobilization om no3 n and nh4 n are significantly positively related to frbd and frld table 4 fig 9 which indicated soil carbon and mineral nitrogen tightly linked to fine root growth traits mineral nitrogen is more easily absorbed by plants than other nitrogen forms mishra et al 2005 nannipieri and eldor 2009 that might be the reason for the little effect of tn on fine root traits among two years which was inconsistent with the result of yan et al 2019 as the main carbon source of soil nutrition om plays a key role in the soil nitrogen turnover to influence the soil mineral content wu et al 2019 besides it could directly influence soil microbial activity and soil structures poirier et al 2018 lehtonen et al 2016 found the c n ratio of the organic layer or upper 0 20 cm peat layer could explain the main variation in fine root biomass of boreal forests plenty of studies focused on the effect of different nitrogen forms on fine root development plasticity and nitrogen absorption efficiency min et al 1999 testified different nitrogen forms could affect nitrogen absorption patterns in three different species domenicano et al 2011 found the nitrate treated hybrid poplars had higher fine root proportions and srl which was consistent with our study that no3 n significantly positively correlated with srl dong et al 2009 and chang et al 2018 also found the preference of no3 n for p tomentosa seedlings olsthoorn et al 1991 illustrated that douglas fir had a preferential ammonium uptake in tall containers of sand while tran et al 2015 found the root plasticity of rice didn t change by different forms of soil n in our study both no3 n and nh4 n had significant positive effects on fine root growth traits of young p tomentosa plantations it indicated that young aged p tomentosa clone s86 might not have the preference for different nitrogen forms on sandy loam soil furthermore p was also involved in many important metabolic processes xia et al 2020 fast growing tree species usually have better p acquisition traits such as higher srl root length root density surface area and the symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi burleigh et al 2002 comas et al 2002 péret et al 2011 although p had little effect on fine root growth traits in our study there was a significant positive correlation between tp and frtd and a significant negative correlation with frad table 4 fig 9 swc was also the key factor affecting fine root traits especially for the plants grown in the water limited area wilcox et al 2004 montagnoli et al 2012 fu et al 2016 zou et al 2019 but it showed a weak correlation between swc and fine root traits in our study which might be due to the relatively uniform soil moisture status among different dif treatments in 0 80 cm soil layers in early september data not shown fine root traits could be influenced by soil moisture during the whole growing season dif practices affected soil moisture tn no3 n and nh4 n directly he et al 2018 2021 and further influenced tp and om previous studies illustrated the addition of nitrogen fertilizers had marked effects on the absorption of phosphorus by plants including the biological effects and chemical effects grunes 1959 laboski and lamb 2003 shen et al 2011 yan et al 2016 besides numerous studies suggested that n fertilizer could influence om by root exudates soil microbial activity soil nitrogen content and so on fontaine and barot 2005 potthoff et al 2005 kaspari et al 2008 treseder 2008 considering our previous studies on soil moisture and nutrient availability in the drip irrigation systems xi et al 2017 he et al 2021 dif was an effective way to regulate soil moisture and nutrients and further affect the growth and morphological traits of fine roots 5 conclusions the responses of fine root growth and morphology plasticity to drip irrigation and nitrogen fertigation dif practices of triploid p tomentosa plantations in the north china plain varied along with soil profile and stand age in general fine root showed a conservative foraging strategy in well watered and nitrogen fertigation treatments during two years the fine root characteristics such as frbd frld frsa and srl are sensitive and crucial for resource acquisition in soil moisture and nutrient variable conditions all the trait plasticity might be attributed to the changeable soil properties such as soil water content organic matter nitrate and ammonium nitrogen and total phosphorus besides the fine root mass showed little difference among dif treatments it indicated that fine root growth and morphological traits responded to the resource heterogeneity for better resource acquisition rather than the mass plasticity in young aged p tomentosa stand further studies on its underlying drivers e g fine root growth dynamics and turnover are still needed to be monitored for a better understanding of the special root foraging strategy in the north china plain declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

9758,a field experiment was conducted in 2017 and 2018 to investigate the responses of fine root growth and morphology plasticity to drip irrigation and nitrogen fertigation dif in a young triploid p tomentosa plantation in the north china plain we monitored four dif treatments i20f0 i20fh i45f0 i45fh which were the combinations of two irrigation thresholds 20 kpa and 45 kpa denoted as i20 and i45 and two n fertigation amounts 0 denoted as f0 220 and 260 kg n ha 1 year 1 in 2017 and 2018 denoted as fh some soil properties and aboveground growth parameters were also monitored i20 significantly improved fine root biomass density frbd by 156 92 and induced a significant reduction of specific root length srl by 28 79 in 0 30 cm soil layers than i45 and fh significantly decreased fine root length density 62 88 surface area 54 01 and srl 39 01 in 30 80 cm soil layers than f0 in 2017 fine root traits differed little among dif treatments in 0 30 cm soil layers in 2018 but i20 significantly improved frbd by 259 98 than i45 and fh significantly improved fine root averaged diameter by 67 14 in 30 80 cm soil layers than f0 these suggested that fine root had a conservative foraging strategy in water and nitrogen rich conditions all the trait plasticity might be due to the changeable soil properties i e soil water content organic matter nitrate and ammonium nitrogen and total phosphorus based on the little difference of fine root mass among dif treatments in two years we hold the view that fine root distribution pattern and some growth and morphological traits adapted to water nitrogen heterogeneity more easily than the mass plasticity in young aged p tomentosa plantations yet enhancing our understanding of fine root foraging strategy in response to dif practices and how it affects tree growth requires more attention to some physiological and biochemical processes and the growth dynamics of the root systems key words fine root morphology vertical distribution soil property drip irrigation fertigation poplar 1 introduction fine roots play a crucial role in forest carbon nutrient and water cycles it is a major reservoir of carbon and the production accounts for up to 75 of the net primary production in mature forests gill and jackson 2000 norby and jackson 2000 finér et al 2011 as the most active part of the root system fine roots are responsible for water and nutrient acquisition gordon and jackson 2000 wang and guo 2008 wang et al 2017 they have evolved a range of belowground strategies for resource acquisition such as modifying biomass allocation growth and morphology plasticity and physiological and biotic root traits bardgett et al 2014 under the background of global warming and n deposition previous studies have illustrated the general enhancement of fine root production in n limited temperate forests and the growth trait in some water deficient conditions nadelhoffer 2000 majdi and andersson 2005 zou et al 2019 however how fine roots respond to water nitrogen changeable conditions in artificial forests especially in the young aged stand remains poorly understood fine root has high growth and morphology trait plasticity for resource acquisition eissenstat 2000 bardgett et al 2014 kou et al 2015 functional equilibrium hypothesis and resource economics theory were well recognized for root foraging strategy trees either use an extensive strategy to invest resources for root growth or an intensive strategy to sustain growth by root morphological adaptions i e higher specific root length and root surface area under stress conditions eissenstat and yanai 1997 ostonen et al 2007a several opposing views still existed that might attribute to the specific species and genotypes the characteristics of the study site tree growth stage and the diverse forest management scarce studies focused on root foraging strategy in the artificial poplar forests therefore it is necessary to find out the specific resource foraging strategy under drip irrigation and nitrogen fertigation dif treatments in the young aged poplar plantations to improve the cultivation techniques of triploid populus tomentosa in the future fine roots absorb water and nutrients for photosynthesis and leaves provide them with hydrocarbon products in return wright et al 2004 the knowledge of fine root biomass at the individual tree level and its relationships with leaves and stem growth aboveground is still scarce zhou et al 2018 previous studies have demonstrated the economic trade offs between leaf and root in some chemical structural and physiological properties weemstra et al 2016 the organ biomass allocation patterns of p tomentosa plantations were also testified by the allometric growth equations or the dirichlet regression model to some extent poorter and sack 2012 wang et al 2015 he et al 2020 however the specific leaf root relationships with the stand growth in young aged p tomentosa plantations remain rudimentary poplar is one of the fast growing commercial species widely planted in the north china plain perry et al 2001 dickmann 2006 he et al 2020 innovations in irrigation and fertigation techniques usually focus on optimizing timing wetting patterns and irrigation fertigation intensity to increase resource use efficiency dai 2019 dif was an effective practice applied in artificial forest cultivation to improve resource utilization efficiency nowadays li et al 2003 yan et al 2016 he et al 2020 previous studies have investigated some fine root dynamics and morphology traits of poplars under drip irrigated systems zhang et al 2013 yan et al 2019 zou et al 2019 however rare studies focus on the effects of both water and nitrogen supply on fine root traits under dif practices much less about their interactions furthermore it is of great importance to figure out the mechanisms of fine root adaption and foraging strategies under dif treatments in such a typical stand to guide the long term cultivation of poplars the objective of this study was to figure out fine root growth and morphological plasticity in response to dif treatments in young aged p tomentosa plantations in the north china plain the relationship between tree growth and the resource acquisition organs i e leaf root was also explored to achieve these goals we monitored fine root growth and morphological traits i e fine root biomass density frbd fine root length density frld fine root surface area frsa specific root length srl fine root averaged diameter frad and fine root tissue density frtd beneath the dripper and measured the soil properties of the corresponding soil layers besides total fine root biomass leaf biomass and the tree basal area in different dif treatments were also monitored in 2 and 3 year old stand 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design this study was conducted in a state owned forest farm near qingping town gaotang county shandong province 36 48 46 n 116 05 24 e northern china this area is a typical yellow river alluvial plain and features a warm temperate monsoon climate the basic information is as follows elevation 30 m annual average temperature 13 2 c average annual rainfall 544 7 mm mainly in july and august average frost free period about 204 days free water surface evaporation 1880 mm he et al 2021 the soil is a sandy loam with a ph of 8 42 and the total nitrogen n mineral n available phosphorus p available potassium k and organic matter om were 0 23 g kg 1 2 62 mg kg 1 4 92 mg kg 1 71 33 mg kg 1 and 3 34 g kg 1 in 0 80 cm soil layers detailed information of soil physical and chemical properties has been presented in he et al 2021 the experimental plantation was planted from 2 year old stem cuttings of a triploid p tomentosa clone clone s86 p tomentosa p bolleana p alba p glandulosa spaced at 2 m 3 m intervals in april 2016 the average height and diameter at breast height dbh of the seedlings were 3 30 m and 2 68 cm respectively the base fertilizer was an organic inorganic compound fertilizer which contained more than 15 organic matter and the proportion of total n phosphorus pentoxide and potassium oxide were 14 12 and 5 respectively we applied 70 g base fertilizer per tree during afforestation a surface drip irrigation system was installed in the experimental field in october 2016 drip irrigation and nitrogen fertigation dif experiment was initiated in april 2017 as a randomized block experimental design consisting of 5 replicate blocks encompassing total 65 plots briefly each block contained 13 plots including 1 untreated control non irrigation and non fertigation and 12 dif treatments combinations of 3 irrigation thresholds and 4 n fertigation amounts different irrigation thresholds were designed based on our previous study of the quantitative relationship between poplar growth and soil water availability in the growing season xi et al 2016 2017 and the soil properties of our experimental site consequently irrigation was initiated when the average soil matric potential at 20 cm soil depth under the dripper reached 20 kpa 79 of field capacity and 73 of soil water availability 33 kpa 67 of field capacity and 57 of soil water availability and 45 kpa 60 of field capacity and 48 of soil water availability denoted as i20 i33 and i45 respectively the irrigation amount of i20 i33 and i45 were 3474 151 and 167 m3 ha 1 in 2017 and were 4557 1146 and 0 m3 ha 1 in 2018 the irrigation times of i20 i33 and i45 were 29 1 and 1 in 2017 and were 25 5 and 0 in 2018 details seen in he et al 2020 according to the growth pattern and n absorption characteristics of p tomentosa wang 2015 n fertigation was applied at 0 and 0 80 and 120 150 and 190 220 and 260 kg n ha 1 year 1 in 2017 and 2018 denoted as f0 fl fm and fh respectively n fertigation was applied with a constant urea nitrate solution 233 5 g n l 1 through the drip irrigation system 6 times each year more details about the experimental design were described in he et al 2018 2020 2 2 sampling root traits measurement and growth assessment the sequential coring method was used to sample root for root abundance and morphology in early september in 2017 and 2018 four and three averaged size trees per treatment were selected from i20f0 i20fh i45fh and control plots in four and three blocks in 2017 and 2018 respectively the soil core was taken at 30 cm distance to the trunk and directly underneath the dripper eight and fifteen soil samples were extracted in 0 80 cm and 0 150 cm soil layers with 10 cm depth per sampling core in 2017 and 2018 respectively using the steel soil auger of 5 5 cm internal diameter a total of 308 soil cores were collected the soil cores were placed into plastic bags and then washed gently by running water through sieve nets to get them clean live roots were distinguished from dead roots according to the difference in root shape elasticity and color xi et al 2013 wang et al 2019 fine roots diameter 2 mm were distinguished from coarse roots diameter 2 mm by vernier caliper all live fine roots in 0 80 cm soil layers were transported to the laboratory stored at 20 c and then processed for morphological trait analysis fine root samples in 80 150 cm soil layers in 2018 were directly oven dried for the biomass data the fine root samples in 0 80 cm soil layers were arranged on a transparent plate and scanned using an epson perfection v850 pro scanner at a resolution of 400 dpi roots were then oven dried at 65 c for 48 h and weighted to estimate dry mass scanned images were analyzed for root length root surface area root projected area and root volume using the winrhizo image analysis software regent instruments inc quebec canada fine root biomass density frbd g m 3 fine root length density frld m m 3 and fine root surface area frsa m2 m 3 were calculated as root mass root length and root surface area per soil core volume respectively specific root length srl m g 1 was calculated as root length per unit root dry mass fine root averaged diameter frad mm and fine root tissue density frtd g m 3 was the ratio of total projected area to the total root length and root dry mass to its volume respectively besides total fine root biomass and leaf biomass were obtained from the destructive biomass samplings in the late growing season in i20fh and control treatments in 2017 and in i20f0 i20fh i45fh and control treatments in 2018 details seen in he et al 2020 we also measured dbh of the sampled trees to calculate the stand basal area ba and then calculated fine root biomass per ba as proxies for the relative allocation of absorptive roots ostonen et al 2017 2 3 soil properties soil samples collected from the soil cores by 20 cm intervals in 0 80 cm soil depths in early september in 2017 and 2018 were used to determine soil properties including total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp soil organic matter om nitrate nitrogen no3 n ammonium nitrogen nh4 n soil water content swc and ph we collected fresh soil samples through the 2 mm sieve and then separated them into two subsamples one fresh subsample nearly 60 g was used for no3 n nh4 n and swc analysis approximately 30 g fresh soil was dried in an oven at 105 c to a constant weight to determine swc another one was air dried for om ph tn and tp analysis the fresh subsamples for no3 n and nh4 n measurements were immediately brought back to the laboratory and stored in the refrigerator at 20 c until further analysis extraction of no3 n and nh4 n was conducted with 1 m kcl extracting solution at a liquid soil ratio of 5 1 and processed using standard methods no3 n and nh4 n concentrations mg l 1 were measured by continuous flow injection colorimetry seal analytical aa3 seal analytical gmbh norderstedt germany tn was determined by digestion with concentrated sulphuric perchloric acid and measured using continuous flow injection colorimetry seal analytical aa3 seal analytical gmbh norderstedt germany tp was measured by molybdenum antimony colorimetry om was measured by potassium dichromate volumetric method and soil ph was measured using a standard ph meter mettler toledo switzerland with a soil water ratio of 1 2 5 all measurement methods followed lu 2000 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analysis was conducted using r software r core team 2015 analysis of variance anova was performed for fine root growth and morphological traits with dif treatments irrigation threshold n fertigation amount and soil depths as factors before anovas the data were checked for normality and homogeneity of variances and log transformed to correct deviations from these assumptions when needed tukey s hsd test was used to test differences among treatment means and different soil layers for significance at α 0 05 the relationship between fine root to leaf biomass ratio and basal area was performed by simple regressions pearson s correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the relationships between soil properties and fine root trait variables redundancy analysis rda was conducted to determine the relative importance of soil properties contributing to fine root trait variation we analyzed 4 treatments in 2017 and 2018 i e i20f0 i20fh i45fh and control according to the records of water meter and our previous study on the evaporation of p tomentosa stand xi et al 2017 he et al 2020 the irrigation amount of i45f0 treatment was only 16 7 mm in 2017 which was much less than soil evaporation in non irrigation and non fertigation treatment control besides there was no water supply by dif practice in i45f0 treatment in 2018 so we take control as i45f0 treatment to do data analysis during these two years 3 results 3 1 fine root vertical distribution abundance and morphology fine root abundance frbd frld and morphological trait i e frsa were significantly changed by soil depths in 2017 and 2018 table 1 figs 2 4 the significant interaction between irrigation threshold and soil depth in 2017 indicated the fine root traits throughout the soil profile differed between different irrigation treatments across different treatment the proportion of fine root biomass in 0 30 cm soil layers ranged from 44 1 to 79 2 in 2017 fig 1 a besides i20 associated treatments significantly increased fine root biomass and decreased srl in 0 30 cm surface soil in 2017 table 2 n fertigation amount had a significant effect on some root abundance and morphology traits i e frld frsa srl in 30 80 cm soil layer in 2017 frld frsa and srl of fh treatments decreased by 62 88 54 01 and 39 01 compared with non fertigation treatments respectively fine root distribution pattern changed to some extent in 2018 fig 1 the cumulative frbd in 0 30 cm soil layer was up to 81 26 in i45f0 nearly 28 36 higher than other treatments irrigation threshold and n fertigation amount had little effect on fine root in surface soil in 2018 frbd in i20 treatments was 3 6 fold than that of i45 treatments in 30 80 cm soil layer table 2 fh significantly increased frad in 30 80 cm soil layer there was also a significant interactive effect of irrigation threshold and n fertigation amount on srl in deeper soil 3 2 fine root growth and morphological traits in different soil layers dif treatments had effects on fine root traits mostly in 0 60 cm soil layers in 2017 figs 2 7 frbd frld and frsa were significantly higher in i20f0 treatment than that of i45fh treatment in 0 10 cm soil layer frld and frsa in i45f0 treatment were 4 5 5 fold that of i20fh treatment in 30 40 cm soil layer srl was 72 7 higher in i45f0 treatment than that of high fertigation treatments i e i45fh i20fh in 0 20 cm soil layer in contrast with the relative lower 26 5 frtd in the same soil layer but there was no significant change in root diameter srl in i45f0 was 71 4 higher than that of i45fh in 0 10 cm soil layer and 131 6 higher than that of i20fh in 10 20 cm soil layer respectively there was less effect of dif treatment on fine root traits in different soil layers in 2018 except for the highest frbd in i20fh treatment in 30 40 cm soil layer and the higher frad in i45fh treatment in 50 60 cm soil layer figs 2 6 3 3 fine root growth in response to drip irrigation and nitrogen fertigation the total fine root biomass to leaf biomass ratio significantly decreased with the increment of basal area power function among dif treatments fig 8 it indicated that less fine root was needed to maintain the unit amount of foliage with the aboveground growth there was no significant difference in total fine root biomass among different treatments in the same year 2017 or 2018 as well as the total fine root biomass per basal area table 3 the pearson s correlation coefficients between fine root traits and soil properties indicated that om no3 n and nh4 n were all significantly positively correlated with frbd frld and frsa tp and no3 n were also significantly correlated with frad and frtd there was a significant positive correlation between srl and no3 n table 4 the pearson s correlation was also confirmed by the rda results which demonstrated that om no3 n nh4 n and tp were the best explanatory variables fig 9 they accounted for very significant proportions of the variation in the fine root trait syndromes under different dif regimes the soil properties explained 90 06 of the total variation with axes 1 and 2 explaining 59 17 and 30 89 of the total variation respectively fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 fine root trait plasticity in response to dif practices drip irrigation and nitrogen fertigation dif significantly affected the water and nitrogen distribution patterns in 2017 and 2018 he et al 2018 2021 therefore fine root showed some growth and morphological plasticity under dif treatments during two years differential responses to dif treatments illustrated that fine root had the extensive increased fine root growth and intensive morphological adaptations foraging strategy ostonen et al 2007b 2011 helmisaari et al 2009 it indicated some root parameters had intimate relations with water and nitrogen acquisition such as fine root length biomass surface area and specific root length table 1 root systems are known to show high plasticity in response to genetic variability and environmental conditions based on the phylogenetic conservatism comas et al 2002 kong et al 2014 root diameter and tissue density are less plastic than root length and surface area majdi 2001 leuschner and hertel 2003 ostonen et al 2007a 2007b but frad was still influenced by soil depth and fertigation in our 2 and 3 year old stand table 1 all these showed the high plasticity of fine root growth and morphological traits in young aged p tomentosa stand under dif practices on sandy loam soil plant root patterns could be influenced by irrigation frequency and fertilizer amount sharma et al 2018 hou et al 2019 ma et al 2020 which was consistent with our results to some extent table 2 figs 1 7 the wetting zone was the key area for water and nitrogen supplement under drip irrigation systems li et al 2005 2018 xi et al 2016 especially in the dry growing season he et al 2021 so it might be the reason for frbd increment in shallow soil layers in high irrigation level in the 2 year old stand table 2 zou et al 2019 demonstrated that drip irrigation had less effect on fine root biomass in the 2 year old p tomentosa stand clone b301 but the rooting depth significantly changed to the shallow soil layers in sufficient water conditions the different responses of fine root to soil moisture might be attributed to the intraspecific differences and the variability of weather conditions in different years in contrast with the higher frbd in the high irrigation associated treatments srl significantly decreased in 0 30 cm soil layer in 2017 which was similar to the result by ostonen et al 2007b according to the optimality theory the lower srl indicated a good investment of fine root biomass with less absorptive morphological traits in the resource rich conditions eissenstat and yanai 1997 fertigation had less effect on fine root traits in 0 30 cm soil layers during 2 years though the mineral nitrogen content in surface soil layers was significantly improved by dif treatments he et al 2021 previous studies showed that fertigation also had less effect on the growth of young aged p tomentosa plantations he et al 2020 2021 nevertheless fine root properties were influenced by fertigation in the deeper soil layers to some extent based on our knowledge of water and nitrogen distribution patterns in previous studies fertigation can still improve mineral nitrogen content in 30 80 cm soil layers especially in high fertigation treatments after irrigation and precipitation he et al 2018 2021 frld frsa and srl significantly decreased in 2017 and frad significantly increased in 2018 in fertigation treatments in deeper soil layers table 2 which was also consistent with the resource economics hypothesis that fine roots adopted the relative conservative strategy in nutrient rich soil kong et al 2019 the anovas for the effects of drip irrigation threshold nitrogen fertigation amount soil depth and their interactions on fine root traits were performed in 2017 and 2018 separately table 1 due to the data collection in consecutive two years and the differences of fine root traits among the two years could be easily observed in figs 1 7 the variable weather conditions i e heavy precipitation changed stand growth pattern in 2018 he et al 2021 as well as influenced fine root distribution pattern and growth traits tables 1 2 fig 1 more fine roots concentrated in the shallow soil layers in i45f0 treatment in 2018 and irrigation still had a significant effect on frbd in 30 40 cm soil layer the limitation of soil moisture on sandy loam soil can be alleviated by precipitation and the water stress treatments might adopt an extensive foraging strategy for water acquisition in our young aged stand eissenstat and yanai 1997 ostonen et al 2017 plenty of studies investigated the effect of climate changes on fine root morphology anatomy and carbon allocation verburg et al 2013 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 they found the fine root growth of woody plant was mostly stimulated by precipitation and nitrogen deposition in the semi arid ecosystem because of the limitation of soil moisture and nitrogen availability fertigation still affected some morphological traits in 30 80 cm soil layers in 2018 i e bigger frad and lower srl representing the conservative foraging strategy the heavy precipitation could make a deeper movement of mineral nitrogen under dif treatment in our study site he et al 2021 which could explain the conservative foraging strategy in nutrient rich conditions 4 2 growth and morphological trait syndromes and their correlations with soil properties during two years although dif treatment affected some fine root growth and morphological traits in the specific soil layers figs 2 7 there was no significant difference in the total fine root biomass among different treatments table 3 it illustrated a special root strategy for 2 and 3 year old p tomentosa plantations that is the response of fine root morphological traits to the resource heterogeneity in different soil layers maybe more important than the root mass plasticity weemstra et al 2017 investigated fine root trait plasticity and found that trees showed more changes in fine root mass than in fine root morphology to acquire resources on poor soils and the root shoot ratio increased on the sandy soil conversely our study showed that fine root had more trait plasticity but less mass plasticity in different dif treatments although dif treatments had little effect on fine root mass among two years high irrigation amount or high fertigation amount treatment still altered biomass allocation patterns to some extent he et al 2020 based on the root biomass data in he et al 2020 we inferred that the young aged poplars might invest more carbon to coarse root for the anchorage and transport function to enhance root lifespan and retain resources first and then produce more fine root for resource acquisition in our study site bardgett et al 2014 reich 2014 weemstra et al 2016 considering the relationship between above and belowground organs there was no significant difference in fine root biomass per basal area among different dif treatments during two years though it was higher in 2017 table 3 fig 8 it interpreted the young aged trees might need more fine roots to sustain a certain amount of aboveground growth helmisaari et al 2002 found the 15 year old saplings had a higher fine root proportion than the mature stage of scots pine leuschner et al 2004 and lei et al 2012 also held the view that fine root adaptation strategies might be more pronounced and significant for young trees as large trees had the greater ability to control the internal nutrient and carbohydrate mobilization om no3 n and nh4 n are significantly positively related to frbd and frld table 4 fig 9 which indicated soil carbon and mineral nitrogen tightly linked to fine root growth traits mineral nitrogen is more easily absorbed by plants than other nitrogen forms mishra et al 2005 nannipieri and eldor 2009 that might be the reason for the little effect of tn on fine root traits among two years which was inconsistent with the result of yan et al 2019 as the main carbon source of soil nutrition om plays a key role in the soil nitrogen turnover to influence the soil mineral content wu et al 2019 besides it could directly influence soil microbial activity and soil structures poirier et al 2018 lehtonen et al 2016 found the c n ratio of the organic layer or upper 0 20 cm peat layer could explain the main variation in fine root biomass of boreal forests plenty of studies focused on the effect of different nitrogen forms on fine root development plasticity and nitrogen absorption efficiency min et al 1999 testified different nitrogen forms could affect nitrogen absorption patterns in three different species domenicano et al 2011 found the nitrate treated hybrid poplars had higher fine root proportions and srl which was consistent with our study that no3 n significantly positively correlated with srl dong et al 2009 and chang et al 2018 also found the preference of no3 n for p tomentosa seedlings olsthoorn et al 1991 illustrated that douglas fir had a preferential ammonium uptake in tall containers of sand while tran et al 2015 found the root plasticity of rice didn t change by different forms of soil n in our study both no3 n and nh4 n had significant positive effects on fine root growth traits of young p tomentosa plantations it indicated that young aged p tomentosa clone s86 might not have the preference for different nitrogen forms on sandy loam soil furthermore p was also involved in many important metabolic processes xia et al 2020 fast growing tree species usually have better p acquisition traits such as higher srl root length root density surface area and the symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi burleigh et al 2002 comas et al 2002 péret et al 2011 although p had little effect on fine root growth traits in our study there was a significant positive correlation between tp and frtd and a significant negative correlation with frad table 4 fig 9 swc was also the key factor affecting fine root traits especially for the plants grown in the water limited area wilcox et al 2004 montagnoli et al 2012 fu et al 2016 zou et al 2019 but it showed a weak correlation between swc and fine root traits in our study which might be due to the relatively uniform soil moisture status among different dif treatments in 0 80 cm soil layers in early september data not shown fine root traits could be influenced by soil moisture during the whole growing season dif practices affected soil moisture tn no3 n and nh4 n directly he et al 2018 2021 and further influenced tp and om previous studies

shen et al 2011 yan et al 2016 besides numerous studies suggested that n fertilizer could influence om by root exudates soil microbial activity soil nitrogen content and so on fontaine and barot 2005 potthoff et al 2005 kaspari et al 2008 treseder 2008 considering our previous studies on soil moisture and nutrient availability in the drip irrigation systems xi et al 2017 he et al 2021 dif was an effective way to regulate soil moisture and nutrients and further affect the growth and morphological traits of fine roots 5 conclusions the responses of fine root growth and morphology plasticity to drip irrigation and nitrogen fertigation dif practices of triploid p tomentosa plantations in the north china plain varied along with soil profile and stand age in general fine root showed a conservative foraging strategy in well watered and nitrogen fertigation treatments during two years the fine root characteristics such as frbd frld frsa and srl are sensitive and crucial for resource acquisition in soil moisture and nutrient variable conditions all the trait plasticity might be attributed to the changeable soil properties such as soil water content organic matter nitrate and ammonium nitrogen and total phosphorus besides the fine root mass showed little difference among dif treatments it indicated that fine root growth and morphological traits responded to the resource heterogeneity for better resource acquisition rather than the mass plasticity in young aged p tomentosa stand further studies on its underlying drivers e g fine root growth dynamics and turnover are still needed to be monitored for a better understanding of the special root foraging strategy in the north china plain declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

9759,ridge furrow ratio can affect the grain yield gy and water productivity wp of rainfed winter wheat under the ridge furrow plastic mulching rfm system however the combined effects of urea type and ridge furrow ratio on gy and wp remain unclear two urea types conventional urea cu and controlled release urea cru and four planting patterns rainfed flat planting f and the rfm system with three ridge furrow ratios 20 cm 40 cm r2f4 40 cm 40 cm r4f4 and 60 cm 40 cm r6f4 were tested during three winter wheat growing seasons from october 2018 to june 2021 the results showed that r2f4 r4f4 and r6f4 increased gy by 51 6 109 5 and 115 2 and increased wp by 38 0 77 1 and 80 3 compared with f respectively with the maximum gy and wp under r4f4 compared with cu cru produced higher gy and wp with mean values of 3460 6 kg ha 1 and 15 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 under cu and 3937 9 kg ha 1 and 16 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 under cru respectively the rfm system decreased the plot to plot variation of gy by 18 9 compared with f but there was no significant difference between cu and cru the rfm system enhanced soil water use rate and crop evapotranspiration thereby promoting dry matter accumulation ultimately and this trend was more obvious at higher ridge furrow ratios compared with cu cru had higher crop evapotranspiration and dry matter but there were no differences in soil water use rate and growing season length between the two urea types in conclusion a ridge furrow ratio of 40 cm 40 cm combined with cru was recommended for improving gy and wp of rainfed winter wheat on the loess plateau of china key words winter wheat ridge furrow ratio urea type grain yield water productivity 1 introduction the loess plateau in the northwest of china is a typical dryland area with mean annual rainfall of 450 mm li et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 zheng et al 2018a 2019 wheat the most important staple crop worldwide is widely cultivated in this area unfortunately approximately 60 of precipitation occurs during the fallow season of winter wheat sun et al 2018 wang et al 2015 yang et al 2021 which does not match the water demand of winter wheat during the growing season therefore wheat yield under the traditional flat planting f in this region is low and highly variable due to the influence of precipitation amount and its seasonal distribution hu et al 2014 luo et al 2021 owing to the lack of irrigation and labor to topdress nitrogen n fertilizer farmers prefer to apply all n fertilizer at once before sowing winter wheat this practice results in an n supply shortage at the later growth stages of winter wheat and lowers the soil water availability and ultimately reduces water productivity wp and grain yield gy of winter wheat liu et al 2014 xue et al 2019 therefore making full use of the limited precipitation by tillage and fertilization strategies is fundamental for improving rainfed wheat yield compared with f the ridge furrow plastic mulching rfm system has gradually become one of the main agronomic measures in rainfed farming systems of northwest china due to its higher precipitation use efficiency gan et al 2013 mo et al 2017 zheng et al 2018b one of the main attributes of this system is that it can significantly improve the rhizosphere soil water condition by guiding precipitation into furrows and suppressing water evaporation from the ridged soil zhou et al 2009 li et al 2012 many studies have shown that the rfm system can promote crop growth and significantly increase gy by increasing crop root growth and dry matter accumulation liu et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 the rfm system has been well demonstrated in a number of crops including maize wheat and potato etc fan et al 2021 hu et al 2014 li et al 2019 mo et al 2017 zheng et al 2021 in addition to increasing crop yields reducing yield variability is another major objective of this technology parr et al 1990 studies have showed that compared with f the rfm system decreased variation of maize gy by 40 09 indicating that maize production was less variable under the rfm system wang et al 2020 nitrogen n is the key factor for improving crop yields during the late growth period therefore ensuring the crop n supply at the later growth stages is essential for high gy mueller and vyn 2016 controlled release urea cru is designed to enhance crop yields by better synchronizing the n supply with plant demand thereby improving n availability significantly compared with conventional urea cu liu et al 2016b yang et al 2017 additionally applying cru can increase root growth depth and root activity thereby enhancing soil water uptake fageria and carvalho 2014 the application of cru generally results in higher gy compared with cu liu et al 2016b li et al 2020 guo et al 2021 although the opposite conclusion has also been observed yu et al 2010 kaur et al 2017 soil moisture and temperature are the most pivotal environmental factors that affect the n availability of cru gao et al 2015 guo et al 2016 how to make full use of cru with reasonable tillage measures needs to be further studied numerous studies have found that the ridge furrow ratio significantly affects soil hydrothermal status and crop productivity gan et al 2013 previous researches mainly focused on the effects of ridge furrow ratio and its unit size on the soil hydrothermal status crop growth and yield formation mo et al 2017 liu et al 2020 luo et al 2021 little is known about the combined effects of ridge furrow ratio and urea type ut on gy and wp of rainfed winter wheat in the rfm system on the loess plateau of china in theory the responses of the two uts to n availability should vary under various ridge furrow ratios therefore the following questions are proposed will the application of cru further increase the gy and wp potential are there combined effects of ridge furrow ratio and ut on gy and wp therefore determining the optimal ridge furrow ratio and appropriate ut may increase wp and gy synchronously which is the production goal in rainfed agriculture the objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate the responses of soil water storage change sws evapotranspiration et and wp to ut and planting pattern p during three winter wheat growing seasons 2 to clarify the mechanism responsible for high gy from the perspective of dry matter accumulation and remobilization and 3 to determine the optimal ridge furrow ratio and ut for increasing gy and wp synchronously 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the field experiment was conducted during the 2018 2019 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 winter wheat growing seasons at shanxi agricultural university in taigu shanxi province china latitude 37 25 n longitude 112 36 e 785 m elevation the site experiences a semi humid climate with a mean annual precipitation of 420 mm the experimental soil was a calcareous cinnamon soil alfisol in u s taxonomy with organic matter content of 22 01 g kg 1 effective phosphorus content of 18 43 mg kg 1 rapidly available potassium content of 236 9 mg kg 1 and alkali solution nitrogen content of 53 8 mg kg 1 the gravimetric moisture content of field water holding capacity and permanent wilting point of the root zone soil were 0 235 m3 m 3 and 0 073 m3 m 3 respectively the monthly rainfall and average air temperature from october 2018 to june 2021 are shown in fig 1 the drought index di was used to assess the variation and status of annual fallow period and growing season rainfall which was calculated using the following equation xie et al 2020 1 di rf rm σ where rf is the annual fallow period and growing season rainfall rm is the mean of annual fallow period and growing season rainfall and σ is the standard deviation of annual fallow period and growing season rainfall di was used to classify years as wet di 0 35 normal 0 35 di 0 35 and dry di 0 35 the annual fallow period and growing season rainfall drought index di and soil water condition are given in table 1 2 2 experimental design the experiment was conducted in a split plot design with three replicates over the three growing seasons two urea types conventional urea cu and controlled release urea cru were chosen as the main plot and four planting patterns rainfed flat planting f and the rfm system with three ridge furrow ratios 20 cm 40 cm r2f4 40 cm 40 cm r4f4 and 60 cm 40 cm r6f4 as sub plot as shown in fig 2 to prevent horizontal water movement a 1 0 m wide guard row was set up between two experimental plots mulching was applied to cover the 15 cm high ridges using 0 008 mm thick transparent polyethylene plastic film the plastic sheets were removed and recycled after harvest the winter wheat variety zhongmai 175 was seeded in drills at a rate of 150 kg ha 1 with a row spacing of 20 cm in all treatments all experimental plots were 36 m2 in area and received 180 kg n ha 1 150 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 120 kg k2o ha 1 all fertilizers were applied in bands as a single dose before planting a polymer coating of sulfur coated urea 24 n released over three months was used as the cru made by the national engineering research center for slow controlled release fertilizers of shandong agriculture university shandong china the experimental plots were kept free of weeds insects and disease using chemicals based on local practices no irrigation was applied throughout the growing seasons 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil water content at sowing seedling regreening flowering grain filling and maturity stages soil samples were collected at 20 cm intervals in the 0 140 cm soil profile using a hand augur for the rfm treatments the samples were collected from the middle of the ridges and furrows and the side of the furrows for the flat planting treatments soil cores were sampled next to the row and in between the two rows gravimetric soil water content was obtained by the oven drying method at 105 soil water storage sws mm and evapotranspiration et mm were calculated as described by wang et al 2018 2 sws h swc ρ 3 et r δsws where h mm is the soil depth swc kg kg 1 is gravimetric soil water content ρ g cm 3 is the soil bulk density r mm is total rainfall during the winter wheat growing season sws mm is the change in soil water storage before planting and after harvest the soil water use rate sp and rainfall use rate pp were calculated based on the ratio of δsws and r relative to et respectively zhong and shang 2014 4 sp 100 δsws et 5 pp 100 r et where et mm is the crop evapotranspiration during the winter wheat growing season 2 3 2 dry matter in each plot above ground plant samples were randomly collected from a 0 5 m2 area at the flowering and maturity stages to estimate dry matter and its components the sampled plants were separated by organs and then dried in an oven at 105 c for 0 5 h and at 75 c until they reached a constant weight different parameters related to dry matter were calculated according to chen et al 2014 6 dry matter remobilization kg ha 1 dry matter at flowering dry matter at maturity excluding grains 7 dry matter remobilization efficiency 100 dry matter remobilization dry matter at flowering 2 3 3 grain yield and water productivity at maturity wheat plants in the central four rows of each plot including the combined area of the ridges and furrows were sampled to calculate grain yield the plot to plot coefficient of variation cv of grain yield for each treatment was calculated using the following equation singh et al 1990 8 cv s gy where s kg ha 1 is the standard deviation and gy kg ha 1 is the average grain yield the water productivity wp kg mm 1 ha 1 was calculated using the following equation qiang et al 2019 9 wp gy et 2 4 statistical analysis the analysis of variance anova was performed using the spss statistical product and service solutions software with urea type planting pattern and year as the main effects including one two and three way interactions the means of the treatments were tested using the least significant difference lsd test at the p 0 05 significance level figures were produced using the origin 8 0 software 3 results 3 1 dynamics of soil water storage the dynamic changes of sws 0 140 cm under the four planting patterns and two uts during the three growing seasons are displayed in fig 3 the sws showed a decreasing trend over time the sws at sowing was about 290 190 and 265 mm during the three growing seasons respectively the f showed higher sws than the rfm systems during the most wheat growing season and the trend was more obvious during the reproductive period the ut also affected sws and the application of cru promoted the decreasing trend of sws than cu 3 2 sws and et both sws and et during the growing seasons were significantly affected by ut p and year y table 2 cru had higher sws and et compared with cu p 0 05 and et was 5 higher under cru across the three seasons in general the rfm system had higher sws and et compared with f with increases in et by 10 2 18 5 and 20 3 under r2f4 r4f4 and r6f4 compared with f across the three seasons respectively the et was higher during 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 compared with that during 2018 2019 the effects of ut p on sws and et were not significant p 0 05 indicating that the effects of p on sws and et were similar independent of cru or cu 3 3 dry matter accumulation and remobilization grain dry matter accumulation depended on the dry matter remobilization from vegetative organs and post flowering dry matter accumulation chen et al 2014 these two indicators were affected by ut p y and p y interaction table 3 compared with cu cru produced greater post flowering dry matter accumulation and lower dry matter remobilization efficiency increasing the ridge furrow ratio increased the post flowering dry matter accumulation and reduced dry matter remobilization efficiency applying cru combined with r4f4 was conducive to higher dry matter at maturity and lower dry matter remobilization efficiency the dry matter at maturity was highest during 2020 2021 9125 9 kg ha 1 followed by 2019 2020 5578 7 kg ha 1 and 2018 2019 5175 4 kg ha 1 the ut p effect on dry matter remobilization efficiency was significant p 0 05 suggesting that the positive effect of ut on dry matter remobilization efficiency varied among the planting patterns however there was no significant effect of ut y on dry matter at maturity and dry matter remobilization efficiency p 0 05 indicating that the effects of ut on the two indicators were similar independent of planting year 3 4 gy and wp the ut p and y all affected gy fig 4 the gy was highest during 2020 2021 5699 6 kg ha 1 followed by 2019 2020 3084 1 kg ha 1 and 2018 2019 2314 1 kg ha 1 averaged across the planting year and ut gy increased with the increasing ridge furrow ratio the maximum gy was achieved under r4f4 which was not significantly different from that under r6f4 p 0 05 gy was 11 8 higher under cru than cu across the three seasons fig 4d in addition the rfm system had a significantly lower coefficient of variation cv in gy than the f treatment p 0 05 similar to gy the ut p and y all affected wp table 2 increasing ridge furrow ratio increased wp with the maximum under r4f4 the wp was 38 0 77 1 and 80 3 higher under r2f4 r4f4 and r6f4 compared with that under f across the three seasons respectively wp was 8 4 higher under cru than cu across the three seasons the wp was highest during 2020 2021 followed by 2019 2020 and 2018 2019 with values of 24 3 13 2 and 10 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively p 0 05 the effects of ut p and ut y on wp were both significant p 0 05 suggesting that the effect of ut on wp varied significantly with planting pattern and year 3 5 soil water use rate and rainfall use rate the ut p and y all affected sp and pp fig 5 because pp and sp were negatively related only pp was used as an example in this study the value of pp was highest during 2019 2020 followed by 2018 2019 and 2020 2021 with values of 72 8 55 9 and 43 7 respectively p 0 05 averaged across ut and y increasing ridge furrow ratio lowered pp and pp was higher under r4f4 and r6f4 relative to that under r2f4 and f however there was no significant p 0 05 difference in pp between the two uts fig 5d 3 6 crop phenology the vegetative period v and reproductive period r were affected by ut and p table 4 the v and the whole growing season w were not affected by ut during the three seasons p 0 05 the effects of p on v r and w periods were all significant p 0 05 there was a general trend for the prolonged duration of r and w but shortened the duration of v with the increase in ridge furrow ratio the ut p interaction had no significant p 0 05 effect on any indicator indicating that the effects of p on these indicators were similar independent of cru or cu 4 discussion 4 1 effects of planting pattern and urea type on crop water consumption the rfm system can collect rainfall and increase infiltration and reduce evaporation and ultimately improve soil water availability li et al 2019 luo et al 2021 consistent with previous studies the rfm system maintained lower sws levels from regreening to maturity stages compared with f fig 3 this was mainly attributed to that the rfm system promoted wheat growth and thus increased soil water consumption jia et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the rfm system especially under higher ridge furrow ratios resulted in a significantly higher et than f this finding was consistent with previous reports li et al 2019 the sws was higher under cu than cru during the reproductive period than the vegetative period because cru can significantly improve n availability particularly at the later growth stages yang et al 2017 li et al 2020 it can increase root activity and promote post flowering dry matter accumulation and soil water consumption table 3 thereby inducing higher swc and e zhang et al 2018 li et al 2019 a rainfed crop s et is determined by rainfall and δswc qiang et al 2019 why can higher yield be achieved in the rfm system we further analyzed both the rate of soil water use and of rainfall use in et the rainfall use rate was higher under r4f4 and r6f4 compared with that under r2f4 and f fig 5 with an opposite trend for soil water use rate therefore sp contributed greatly to et in the rfm system compared with the f system this finding could be attributed to the rfm system especially under higher ridge furrow ratios which easily aggravated the soil water consumption swc compared with f zhang et al 2018 li et al 2019 this finding was supported by the significant positive correlation between gy and sp table 5 therefore increased soil water consumption is vital for winter wheat production in rainfed agriculture 4 2 effects of planting pattern and urea type on crop phenology and dry matter accumulation the rfm system is an effective strategy for accelerating crop growth and development due to improved soil thermal conditions gan et al 2013 ren et al 2009 li et al 2019 consistent with previous studies the rfm system shortened the wheat vegetative period by 3 4 3 5 and 3 days compared with f during the three successive seasons respectively that s because the warming effect of mulching mainly occurred during the early growth period of wheat fang et al 2021 in our study ut affected the reproductive period during the 2018 2019 and 2020 2021 seasons table 4 mainly because applying cru improved n availability during the whole growing season and delayed the leaf senescence of crops li et al 2020 no difference between the two uts was found during the reproductive period during 2019 2020 this may be because lower sws before planting and sparse rainfall during the reproductive period 20 6 mm did not favor dissolution and release of cru and the difference in n availability between cu and cru thus disappeared li et al 2013 shao et al 2013 the rfm system can promote crop dry matter accumulation over f mo et al 2017 liu et al 2020 and increasing ridge width can increase dry matter to a limited extent liu et al 2020 the dry matter accumulation in our study was consistent with previous studies the dry matter remobilization efficiency was lower under r4f4 and r6f4 compared with that under r2f4 and f this may be because the rfm system with wide ridges increased water availability which was beneficial for post flowering dry matter accumulation table 3 thereby significantly decreasing dry matter remobilization efficiency in addition to planting pattern ut also affected dry matter accumulation and resulted in higher dry matter accumulation at maturity and lower dry matter remobilization efficiency under cru compared with cu similar results have been previously reported liu et al 2016a yang et al 2017 4 3 effects of planting pattern and urea type on grain yield and water productivity the yield increasing rate of rfm relative to f was 148 0 87 1 and 77 7 during 2018 2019 dry year 2019 2020 wet year and 2020 2021 dry year respectively the result during 2020 2021 was not consistent with previous studies liu and siddique 2015 li et al 2019 liu et al 2020 which found that the yield increasing effect of rfm relative to flat planting was most evident in dry years this contrast can be due to that we did not consider that the effect of the stored soil water about 280 mm before planting in 2020 2021 which may be important for winter wheat production sun et al 2018 yang et al 2021 reducing gy variability is another major objective of developing the rfm system parr et al 1990 zhang et al 2018 in our study the rfm system decreased the plot to plot variation of gy by 18 9 compared with f fig 4d indicating that wheat production was less variable in the rfm system it was mainly attributed to that the rfm system particularly the one with greater ridge width improved water availability and thus reduced the adverse effect of rainfall year type on yield there was a significant negative correlation between gy and growing season rainfall table 5 while previous study showed a significant positive correlation between these two indicators ren et al 2009 zhang et al 2018 the contrast was due to that the 2019 2020 winter wheat growing season had higher rainfall but lower yield dual water drought at the mid late stages can explain the phenomenon for one thing the rainfall in october during 2019 2020 was significant higher than that during the rest two seasons fig 1a for another the soil water storage at sowing during 2019 2020 was lower than that during the rest two seasons fig 3b therefore the high gy of rainfed wheat not only depended on rainfall amount and its distribution during the growing period but also on sws before sowing higher gy was achieved when apply cru in our study due to the higher n availability which was consistent with previous studies liu et al 2016b li et al 2020 improving wp is fundamental to sustainable rainfed crop production mo et al 2017 yang et al 2021 many studies have shown that the rfm planting system can efficiently use rainfall thereby improving the soil water availability and increasing gy and wp ultimately compared with f li et al 2017 jia et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 similar to previous conclusions the rfm system showed higher wp than f in our study studies have shown that the improvement of wp in the rfm system was mainly due to the increasing gy and decreasing et varga et al 2013 li et al 2016 chen et al 2019 unlike previous conclusions the improved wp in our study was achieved by enhancing gy and et synchronously which implied that the yield increasing effect of ridge width was much higher than that of the water consumed in our study cru had greater wp than cu this result was similar to that of liu et al 2016b the effect of ut p y on wp was not significant suggesting that the effect of ut on wp was similar across planting patterns and planting years 4 4 determining optimum ridge furrow ratio and urea type for maximum grain yield determining the optimum ridge furrow ratio is essential for maximizing gy gan et al 2013 luo et al 2021 based on the experimental data in our study fig 4a b c the optimal ridge width for maximum gy were 40 cm under both cru and cu the higher gy under r4f4 was mainly attributed to that it well coordinated the contradiction between rainwater harvesting efficiency and planting area luo et al 2021 the application of cru achieved higher gy compared with cu fig 4d which is mainly because applying cru increased the nitrogen supply at the later growth stage of wheat and enhanced the root water uptake li et al 2016 2020 debaeke and aboudrare 2004 the ridge furrow ratio of 40 cm 40 cm combined with cru achieved maximum gy however more ridge widths should be explored to determine the optimal ridge for the two urea types based on maximum yield 5 conclusions increasing the ridge furrow ratio enhanced sws and et promoted dry matter accumulation and prolonged winter wheat growing season the application of cru resulted in higher sws et and dry matter compared with cu but there was no significant difference during the growing season compared with the f treatment the rfm system exhibited higher gy and wp due to the improved soil water condition with maximum mean values of 4584 8 kg ha 1 and 19 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 under r4f4 respectively moreover applying cru resulted in superior gy and wp compared with cu therefore the findings suggest that a ridge furrow ratio of 40 cm 40 cm combined with cru can improve winter wheat gy

mean values of 3460 6 kg ha 1 and 15 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 under cu and 3937 9 kg ha 1 and 16 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 under cru respectively the rfm system decreased the plot to plot variation of gy by 18 9 compared with f but there was no significant difference between cu and cru the rfm system enhanced soil water use rate and crop evapotranspiration thereby promoting dry matter accumulation ultimately and this trend was more obvious at higher ridge furrow ratios compared with cu cru had higher crop evapotranspiration and dry matter but there were no differences in soil water use rate and growing season

flat planting f in this region is low and highly variable due to the influence of precipitation amount and its seasonal distribution hu et al 2014 luo et al 2021 owing to the lack of irrigation and labor to topdress nitrogen n fertilizer farmers prefer to apply all n fertilizer at once before sowing winter wheat this practice results in an n supply shortage at the later growth stages of winter wheat and lowers the soil water availability and ultimately reduces water productivity wp and grain yield gy of winter wheat liu et al 2014 xue et al 2019 therefore making full use of the limited precipitation by tillage and fertilization strategies is fundamental for improving rainfed wheat yield compared with f the ridge furrow plastic mulching rfm system has gradually become one of the main agronomic measures in rainfed farming systems of northwest china due to its higher precipitation use efficiency gan et al 2013 mo et al 2017 zheng et al 2018b one of the main attributes of this system is that it can significantly improve the rhizosphere soil water condition by guiding precipitation into furrows and suppressing water evaporation from the ridged soil zhou et al 2009 li et al 2012 many studies have shown that the rfm system can promote crop growth and significantly increase gy by increasing crop root growth and dry matter accumulation liu et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 the rfm system has been well demonstrated in a number of crops including maize wheat and potato etc fan et al 2021 hu et al 2014 li et al 2019 mo et al 2017 zheng et al 2021 in addition to increasing crop yields reducing yield variability is another major objective of this technology parr et al 1990 studies have showed that compared with f the rfm system decreased variation of maize gy by 40 09 indicating that maize production was less variable under the rfm system wang et al 2020 nitrogen n is the key factor for improving crop yields during the late growth period therefore ensuring the crop n supply at the later growth stages is essential for high gy mueller and vyn 2016 controlled release urea cru is designed to enhance crop yields by better synchronizing the n supply with plant demand thereby improving n availability significantly compared with conventional urea cu liu et al 2016b yang et al 2017 additionally applying cru can increase root growth depth and root activity thereby enhancing soil water uptake fageria and carvalho 2014 the application of cru generally results in higher gy compared with cu liu et al 2016b li et al 2020 guo et al 2021 although the opposite conclusion has also been observed yu et al 2010 kaur et al 2017 soil moisture and temperature are the most pivotal environmental factors that affect the n availability of cru gao et al 2015 guo et al 2016 how to make full use of cru with reasonable tillage measures needs to be further studied numerous studies have found that the ridge furrow ratio significantly affects soil hydrothermal status and crop productivity gan et al 2013 previous researches mainly focused on the effects of ridge furrow ratio and its unit size on the soil hydrothermal status crop growth and yield formation mo et al 2017 liu et al 2020 luo et al 2021 little is known about the combined effects of ridge furrow ratio and urea type ut on gy and wp of rainfed winter wheat in the rfm system on the loess plateau of china in theory the responses of the two uts to n availability should vary under various ridge furrow ratios therefore the following questions are proposed will the application of cru further increase the gy and wp potential are there combined effects of ridge furrow ratio and ut on gy and wp therefore determining the optimal ridge furrow ratio and appropriate ut may increase wp and gy synchronously which is the production goal in rainfed agriculture the objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate the responses of soil water storage change sws evapotranspiration et and wp to ut and planting pattern p during three winter wheat growing seasons 2 to clarify the mechanism responsible for high gy from the perspective of dry matter accumulation and remobilization and 3 to determine the optimal ridge furrow ratio and ut for increasing gy and wp synchronously 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the field experiment was conducted during the 2018 2019 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 winter wheat growing seasons at shanxi agricultural university in taigu shanxi province china latitude 37 25 n longitude 112 36 e 785 m elevation the site experiences a semi humid climate with a mean annual precipitation of 420 mm the experimental soil was a calcareous cinnamon soil alfisol in u s taxonomy with organic matter content of 22 01 g kg 1 effective phosphorus content of 18 43 mg kg 1 rapidly available potassium content of 236 9 mg kg 1 and alkali solution nitrogen content of 53 8 mg kg 1 the gravimetric moisture content of field water holding capacity and permanent wilting point of the root zone soil were 0 235 m3 m 3 and 0 073 m3 m 3 respectively the monthly rainfall and average air temperature from october 2018 to june 2021 are shown in fig 1 the drought index di was used to assess the variation and status of annual fallow period and growing season rainfall which was calculated using the following equation xie et al 2020 1 di rf rm σ where rf is the annual fallow period and growing season rainfall rm is the mean of annual fallow period and growing season rainfall and σ is the standard deviation of annual fallow period and growing season rainfall di was used to classify years as wet di 0 35 normal 0 35 di 0 35 and dry di 0 35 the annual fallow period and growing season rainfall drought index di and soil water condition are given in table 1 2 2 experimental design the experiment was conducted in a split plot design with three replicates over the three growing seasons two urea types conventional urea cu and controlled release urea cru were chosen as the main plot and four planting patterns rainfed flat planting f and the rfm system with three ridge furrow ratios 20 cm 40 cm r2f4 40 cm 40 cm r4f4 and 60 cm 40 cm r6f4 as sub plot as shown in fig 2 to prevent horizontal water movement a 1 0 m wide guard row was set up between two experimental plots mulching was applied to cover the 15 cm high ridges using 0 008 mm thick transparent polyethylene plastic film the plastic sheets were removed and recycled after harvest the winter wheat variety zhongmai 175 was seeded in drills at a rate of 150 kg ha 1 with a row spacing of 20 cm in all treatments all experimental plots were 36 m2 in area and received 180 kg n ha 1 150 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 120 kg k2o ha 1 all fertilizers were applied in bands as a single dose before planting a polymer coating of sulfur coated urea 24 n released over three months was used as the cru made by the national engineering research center for slow controlled release fertilizers of shandong agriculture university shandong china the experimental plots were kept free of weeds insects and disease using chemicals based on local practices no irrigation was applied throughout the growing seasons 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil water content at sowing seedling regreening flowering grain filling and maturity stages soil samples were collected at 20 cm intervals in the 0 140 cm soil profile using a hand augur for the rfm treatments the samples were collected from the middle of the ridges and furrows and the side of the furrows for the flat planting treatments soil cores were sampled next to the row and in between the two rows gravimetric soil water content was obtained by the oven drying method at 105 soil water storage sws mm and evapotranspiration et mm were calculated as described by wang et al 2018 2 sws h swc ρ 3 et r δsws where h mm is the soil depth swc kg kg 1 is gravimetric soil water content ρ g cm 3 is the soil bulk density r mm is total rainfall during the winter wheat growing season sws mm is the change in soil water storage before planting and after harvest the soil water use rate sp and rainfall use rate pp were calculated based on the ratio of δsws and r relative to et respectively zhong and shang 2014 4 sp 100 δsws et 5 pp 100 r et where et mm is the crop evapotranspiration during the winter wheat growing season 2 3 2 dry matter in each plot above ground plant samples were randomly collected from a 0 5 m2 area at the flowering and maturity stages to estimate dry matter and its components the sampled plants were separated by organs and then dried in an oven at 105 c for 0 5 h and at 75 c until they reached a constant weight different parameters related to dry matter were calculated according to chen et al 2014 6 dry matter remobilization kg ha 1 dry matter at flowering dry matter at maturity excluding grains 7 dry matter remobilization efficiency 100 dry matter remobilization dry matter at flowering 2 3 3 grain yield and water productivity at maturity wheat plants in the central four rows of each plot including the combined area of the ridges and furrows were sampled to calculate grain yield the plot to plot coefficient of variation cv of grain yield for each treatment was calculated using the following equation singh et al 1990 8 cv s gy where s kg ha 1 is the standard deviation and gy kg ha 1 is the average grain yield the water productivity wp kg mm 1 ha 1 was calculated using the following equation qiang et al 2019 9 wp gy et 2 4 statistical analysis the analysis of variance anova was performed using the spss statistical product and service solutions software with urea type planting pattern and year as the main effects including one two and three way interactions the means of the treatments were tested using the least significant difference lsd test at the p 0 05 significance level figures were produced using the origin 8 0 software 3 results 3 1 dynamics of soil water storage the dynamic changes of sws 0 140 cm under the four planting patterns and two uts during the three growing seasons are displayed in fig 3 the sws showed a decreasing trend over time the sws at sowing was about 290 190 and 265 mm during the three growing seasons respectively the f showed higher sws than the rfm systems during the most wheat growing season and the trend was more obvious during the reproductive period the ut also affected sws and the application of cru promoted the decreasing trend of sws than cu 3 2 sws and et both sws and et during the growing seasons were significantly affected by ut p and year y table 2 cru had higher sws and et compared with cu p 0 05 and et was 5 higher under cru across the three seasons in general the rfm system had higher sws and et compared with f with increases in et by 10 2 18 5 and 20 3 under r2f4 r4f4 and r6f4 compared with f across the three seasons respectively the et was higher during 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 compared with that during 2018 2019 the effects of ut p on sws and et were not significant p 0 05 indicating that the effects of p on sws and et were similar independent of cru or cu 3 3 dry matter accumulation and remobilization grain dry matter accumulation depended on the dry matter remobilization from vegetative organs and post flowering dry matter accumulation chen et al 2014 these two indicators were affected by ut p y and p y interaction table 3 compared with cu cru produced greater post flowering dry matter accumulation and lower dry matter remobilization efficiency increasing the ridge furrow ratio increased the post flowering dry matter accumulation and reduced dry matter remobilization efficiency applying cru combined with r4f4 was conducive to higher dry matter at maturity and lower dry matter remobilization efficiency the dry matter at maturity was highest during 2020 2021 9125 9 kg ha 1 followed by 2019 2020 5578 7 kg ha 1 and 2018 2019 5175 4 kg ha 1 the ut p effect on dry matter remobilization efficiency was significant p 0 05 suggesting that the positive effect of ut on dry matter remobilization efficiency varied among the planting patterns however there was no significant effect of ut y on dry matter at maturity and dry matter remobilization efficiency p 0 05 indicating that the effects of ut on the two indicators were similar independent of planting year 3 4 gy and wp the ut p and y all affected gy fig 4 the gy was highest during 2020 2021 5699 6 kg ha 1 followed by 2019 2020 3084 1 kg ha 1 and 2018 2019 2314 1 kg ha 1 averaged across the planting year and ut gy increased with the increasing ridge furrow ratio the maximum gy was achieved under r4f4 which was not significantly different from that under r6f4 p 0 05 gy was 11 8 higher under cru than cu across the three seasons fig 4d in addition the rfm system had a significantly lower coefficient of variation cv in gy than the f treatment p 0 05 similar to gy the ut p and y all affected wp table 2 increasing ridge furrow ratio increased wp with the maximum under r4f4 the wp was 38 0 77 1 and 80 3 higher under r2f4 r4f4 and r6f4 compared with that under f across the three seasons respectively wp was 8 4 higher under cru than cu across the three seasons the wp was highest during 2020 2021 followed by 2019 2020 and 2018 2019 with values of 24 3 13 2 and 10 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively p 0 05 the effects of ut p and ut y on wp were both significant p 0 05 suggesting that the effect of ut on wp varied significantly with planting pattern and year 3 5 soil water use rate and rainfall use rate the ut p and y all affected sp and pp fig 5 because pp and sp were negatively related only pp was used as an example in this study the value of pp was highest during 2019 2020 followed by 2018 2019 and 2020 2021 with values of 72 8 55 9 and 43 7 respectively p 0 05 averaged across ut and y increasing ridge furrow ratio lowered pp and pp was higher under r4f4 and r6f4 relative to that under r2f4 and f however there was no significant p 0 05 difference in pp between the two uts fig 5d 3 6 crop phenology the vegetative period v and reproductive period r were affected by ut and p table 4 the v and the whole growing season w were not affected by ut during the three seasons p 0 05 the effects of p on v r and w periods were all significant p 0 05 there was a general trend for the prolonged duration of r and w but shortened the duration of v with the increase in ridge furrow ratio the ut p interaction had no significant p 0 05 effect on any indicator indicating that the effects of p on these indicators were similar independent of cru or cu 4 discussion 4 1 effects of planting pattern and urea type on crop water consumption the rfm system can collect rainfall and increase infiltration and reduce evaporation and ultimately improve soil water availability li et al 2019 luo et al 2021 consistent with previous studies the rfm system maintained lower sws levels from regreening to maturity stages compared with f fig 3 this was mainly attributed to that the rfm system promoted wheat growth and thus increased soil water consumption jia et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the rfm system especially under higher ridge furrow ratios resulted in a significantly higher et than f this finding was consistent with previous reports li et al 2019 the sws was higher under cu than cru during the reproductive period than the vegetative period because cru can significantly improve n availability particularly at the later growth stages yang et al 2017 li et al 2020 it can increase root activity and promote post flowering dry matter accumulation and soil water consumption table 3 thereby inducing higher swc and e zhang et al 2018 li et al 2019 a rainfed crop s et is determined by rainfall and δswc qiang et al 2019 why can higher yield be achieved in the rfm system we further analyzed both the rate of soil water use and of rainfall use in et the rainfall use rate was higher under r4f4 and r6f4 compared with that under r2f4 and f fig 5 with an opposite trend for soil water use rate therefore sp contributed greatly to et in the rfm system compared with the f system this finding could be attributed to the rfm system especially under higher ridge furrow ratios which easily aggravated the soil water consumption swc compared with f zhang et al 2018 li et al 2019 this finding was supported by the significant positive correlation between gy and sp table 5 therefore increased soil water consumption is vital for winter wheat production in rainfed agriculture 4 2 effects of planting pattern and urea type on crop phenology and dry matter accumulation the rfm system is an effective strategy for accelerating crop growth and development due to improved soil thermal conditions gan et al 2013 ren et al 2009 li et al 2019 consistent with previous studies the rfm system shortened the wheat vegetative period by 3 4 3 5 and 3 days compared with f during the three successive seasons respectively that s because the warming effect of mulching mainly occurred during the early growth period of wheat fang et al 2021 in our study ut affected the reproductive period during the 2018 2019 and 2020 2021 seasons table 4 mainly because applying cru improved n availability during the whole growing season and delayed the leaf senescence of crops li et al 2020 no difference between the two uts was found during the reproductive period during 2019 2020 this may be because lower sws before planting and sparse rainfall during the reproductive period 20 6 mm did not favor dissolution and release of cru and the difference in n availability between cu and cru thus disappeared li et al 2013 shao et al 2013 the rfm system can promote crop dry matter accumulation over f mo et al 2017 liu et al 2020 and increasing ridge width can increase dry matter to a limited extent liu et al 2020 the dry matter accumulation in our study was consistent with previous studies the dry matter remobilization efficiency was lower under r4f4 and r6f4 compared with that under r2f4 and f this may be because the rfm system with wide ridges increased water availability which was beneficial for post flowering dry matter accumulation table 3 thereby significantly decreasing dry matter remobilization efficiency in addition to planting pattern ut also affected dry matter accumulation and resulted in higher dry matter accumulation at maturity and lower dry matter remobilization efficiency under cru compared with cu similar results have been previously reported liu et al 2016a yang et al 2017 4 3 effects of planting pattern and urea type on grain yield and water productivity the yield increasing rate of rfm relative to f was 148 0 87 1 and 77 7 during 2018 2019 dry year 2019 2020 wet year and 2020 2021 dry year respectively the result during 2020 2021 was not consistent with previous studies liu and siddique 2015 li et al 2019 liu et al 2020 which found that the yield increasing effect of rfm relative to flat planting was most evident in dry years this contrast can be due to that we did not consider that the effect of the stored soil water about 280 mm before planting in 2020 2021 which may be important for winter wheat production sun et al 2018 yang et al 2021 reducing gy variability is another major objective of developing the rfm system parr et al 1990 zhang et al 2018 in our study the rfm system decreased the plot to plot variation of gy by 18 9 compared with f fig 4d indicating that wheat production was less variable in the rfm system it was mainly attributed to that the rfm system particularly the one with greater ridge width improved water availability and thus reduced the adverse effect of rainfall year type on yield there was a significant negative correlation between gy and growing season rainfall table 5 while previous study showed a significant positive correlation between these two indicators ren et al 2009 zhang et al 2018 the contrast was due to that the 2019 2020 winter wheat growing season had higher rainfall but lower yield dual water drought at the mid late stages can explain the phenomenon for one thing the rainfall in october during 2019 2020 was significant higher than that during the rest two seasons fig 1a for another the soil water storage at sowing during 2019 2020 was lower than that during the rest two seasons fig 3b therefore the high gy of rainfed wheat not only depended on rainfall amount and its distribution during the growing period but also on sws before sowing higher gy was achieved when apply cru in our study due to the higher n availability which was consistent with previous studies liu et al 2016b li et al 2020 improving wp is fundamental to sustainable rainfed crop production mo et al 2017 yang et al 2021 many studies have shown that the rfm planting system can efficiently use rainfall thereby improving the soil water availability and increasing gy and wp ultimately compared with f li et al 2017 jia et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 similar to previous conclusions the rfm system showed higher wp than f in our study studies have shown that the improvement of wp in the rfm system was mainly due to the increasing gy and decreasing et varga et al 2013 li et al 2016 chen et al 2019 unlike previous conclusions the improved wp in our study was achieved by enhancing gy and et synchronously which implied that the yield increasing effect of ridge width was much higher than that of the water consumed in our study cru had greater wp than cu this result was similar to that of liu et al 2016b the effect of ut p y on wp was not significant suggesting that the effect of ut on wp was similar across planting patterns and planting years 4 4 determining optimum ridge furrow ratio and urea type for maximum grain yield determining the optimum ridge furrow ratio is essential for maximizing gy gan et al 2013 luo et al 2021 based on the experimental data in our study fig 4a b c the optimal ridge width for maximum gy were 40 cm under both cru and cu the higher gy under r4f4 was mainly attributed to that it well coordinated the contradiction between rainwater harvesting efficiency and planting area luo et al 2021 the application of cru achieved higher gy compared with cu fig 4d which is mainly because applying cru increased the nitrogen supply at the later growth stage of wheat and enhanced the root water uptake li et al 2016 2020 debaeke and aboudrare 2004 the ridge furrow ratio of 40 cm 40 cm combined with cru achieved maximum gy however more ridge widths should be explored to determine the optimal ridge for the two urea types based on maximum yield 5 conclusions increasing the ridge furrow ratio enhanced sws and et promoted dry matter accumulation and prolonged winter wheat growing season the application of cru resulted in higher sws et and dry matter compared with cu but there was no significant difference during the growing season compared with the f treatment the rfm system exhibited higher gy and wp due to the improved soil water condition with maximum mean values of 4584 8 kg ha 1 and 19 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 under r4f4 respectively moreover applying cru resulted in superior gy and wp compared with cu therefore the findings suggest that a ridge furrow ratio of 40 cm 40 cm combined with cru can improve winter wheat gy and wp the results will help researchers and policy makers to develop strategies for optimizing wheat production and water productivity on the loess plateau of china declaration of competing interest
