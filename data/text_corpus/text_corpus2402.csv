12010,this study focussed on the efficacy of two treatments commercial hardwood biochar and delonix regia pods biomass an agricultural waste as amendment to tropical soils contaminated with lead copper and cadmium ions the use of diffusive gradient in thin films technique dgt and measurement of soil solution concentration as means to assess the available concentration of the metals lead copper and cadmium ions during and after the remediation treatment was carried out furthermore soil dynamics predicted from values of the labile partition coefficient kd response time to depletion tc and rates of exchange or desorption k 1 of metal ions between soil solid phase and soil solution were also obtained using the dgt induced fluxes in soils difs model the heavy metal labile pool size in the soil and their kinetics of resupply in the biochar and delonix regia amended soils were determined the experimental results showed that the biochar treated soils have the highest distribution coefficient kd values in all the soils and for all metals considered the depletion time tc and desorption rate constant k 1 values also revealed that the biochar treated soils would be depleted faster than the delonix regia treated soils thus results from this work has shown that dynamics of metals in soils should be considered after treatment of contaminated soils graphical abstract image 1 keywords heavy metals contaminated soils dgt delonix regia biochar 1 introduction soil is the major reservoir harbouring heavy metal ions released into the environment by human activities wuana and okieimen 2011 once released the total concentration of heavy metals persist in soils for long because they are non biodegradable by micro organisms adriano et al 2004 though their bioavailability and chemical forms may change the use of aqua regia digestion method for determining the total concentration of heavy metals in polluted soils as an index to determine the risk of the soils does not really reflect the toxicity of the soil turull et al 2019 because the fraction available to plants and other soil dwelling organisms are the soluble and exchangeable fractions single and sequential extraction procedures are used to quantify the exchangeable fraction of metals in soils and to assess the interaction of metals with different solid phase components in soils respectively sahuquillo et al 2003 the direct soil solution measurement is another approach for assessing the available metal concentration in soil these measurements methods do not account for the soil replenishing ability after extraction of metal information available on mobility and dynamics of heavy metals are limited and efforts made on establishing correlations between metal fractions in soils and plant uptake have been without great success alvarez et al 2006 in accounting for the dynamics involved diffusive gradients in thin films dgt technique was proposed by davison and zhang 1994 the dgt technique has been used to successfully assess the fluxes of metals in sediments zhang and davison 1995 and it has also been used to assess the kinetics of resupply and the bioavailability of metals to plants hooda and zhang 2008 zhang et al 2002 the dgt technique allowed for in situ metal determination without disrupting the physical chemical equilibrium of the system zhang et al 1998 it was reported by gu et al 2017 that a better index was obtained from dgt measurements for assessing the bioavailability and accumulation of cadmium in earthworms and that dgt can be used as a powerful tool for assessing bioavailability of metals in soils taking into account metal concentration in soil solution and the solid phase and at the same time providing useful information on the kinetics of release from the solid phase to solution muhammad et al 2012 engaged the use of two chemical indicators nano3 extraction and dgt measurements on two indicator plant species common dandelion and narrow leaf plantain result obtained from the dgt measured r values and difs modelling revealed that even though a high toxicity level is observed but once there is decreased kinetics of metal resupply soils were able to keep metal concentrations cd and zn below toxic levels during the phytoextraction process furthermore study by d angelo and starnes 2016 on the desorption kinetics of ciprofloxacin in municipal biosolids as determined by diffusive transport and sorption desorption model simulations using dfis revealed that the hazard risks associated with land application of biosolids will depend strongly on concentrations of labile ciprofloxacin effective diffusion coefficients and sorption desorption exchange kinetics of the biosolids song et al 2018 used the dgt measurements and sequential procedures to assess the environmental risks from a polluted site and quantified the labile pools of copper iron manganese and nickel in soils obtained from a site committed to industrial sludge treatment guan et al 2017 employed dgt technique to assess the desorption of an organic contaminant bisphenols from soil and reported based on the labile partition coefficient kd that most of the bisphenols in the soil could participate in the labile exchange that is be released to the solution sequential extraction and dgt methods were employed by peng et al 2017 to measure selenium se concentrations in soils obtained results revealed that dgt measured se concentrations were several folds higher for selenate than selenite amended soils implying that the bioavailability of selenate to plants is more than that of selenite the work by zhang et al 2004 on the kinetics of zn release in soils showed the ability of dgt to allow for comparative measurements between the zncl2 fields amended and zncl2 contaminated soil and further re established that dgt can be used as a surrogate for the metal that is bioavailable for uptake in the soils biochar are regarded as any carbon rich solid which have been formed because of incomplete combustion of biomass beesley et al 2011 they are known to have a large surface area possess active organic functional groups and micro porous structure and are therefore capable of strong attraction for heavy metals inyang et al 2016 yuan et al 2011 some studies have shown that biochar has a high capacity for pollutants and can be used to stabilize heavy metals in contaminated soils beesley et al 2011 ippolito et al 2012 delonix regia commonly known as flame tree or royal poinnciana is a flowering plant species belonging to the fabaceae family it is used as a shade tree of no other importance than its aesthetic use and it is generally considered as an agricultural waste it has been used in the modified and unmodified form as adsorbent for heavy metals and organic pollutants in soils and solutions babalola et al 2019 babalola et al 2020 babalola and zhang 2020 louis et al 2018 divers investigations had been done on the assessment of metal availability in soils using various techniques such as single and sequential extraction total digestion soil solution concentration and others but few work had been done on remediated soils to investigate its ability to resupply adsorbed metal and on the dynamics kinetics of resupply involved in view of this the aim of this work is to assess the availability of metals in heavy metal contaminated soils after remediation was done by the application of biochar and delonix regia pods powder the assessment was based on soil solution concentration css and dgt measurements cdgt furthermore investigation was carried out on the dynamics of metals in the remediated soils as predicted from values of the labile partition coefficient kd response time to depletion tc and rates of exchange or desorption k 1 of metal ions between soil solid phase and soil solution as obtained using the dgt induced fluxes in soils difs model 2 experimental 2 1 soil properties and amendment the properties of the soil samples obtained at a depth of 0 20 cm from cities in the south western part of nigeria ife ilesha and ijero ekiti is shown in table 1 the results on soil properties showed that the soil samples were extremely poor in organic matter after air drying and sieving through a 2 mm mesh 1 5 kg each of the samples was contaminated with minimum allowable limits pb cu and cd in agricultural soils i e 100 mg pb kg 100 mg cu kg and 5 mg cd kg and incubated for seven days before it was divided into approximately three equal parts one part was homogenously mixed with 2 w w of biochar the second part was mixed with 2 delonix regia pods and the third part without amendment was designated as control all study on samples control and treatments were carried out in triplicates 2 2 deployment of dgt devices nitric acid 10 was used to wash all the experimental apparatuses and the dgt plastic moulds overnight and they were subsequently rinsed with ultra pure water before use chelex binding gels diffusive gels and the dgt devices were prepared and the dgt experimental set up were carried out as described by houben et al 2013 and zhang and davison 1999 certain amount 100g of soil contaminated or controls and treated prepared following the procedures in babalola and zhang 2020 were weighed and mixed with ultra pure mq water to 80 of its maximum water holding capacity the well mixed soil was allowed to equilibrate and divided into three clean pots the acid washed dgt devices with 0 8 mm diffusive and 0 4 mm resin gels layers were deployed after smearing its surface with some of the soil slurry and the set up was covered to prevent water loss the devices were deployed on day 5 21 and day 42 noting the average temperature at the expiration of the 24 h deployment each device was retrieved and the surface rinsed by spraying a jet of water to remove soil particles on opening the binding gels were removed and transferred into clean 1 5 ml centrifuge tubes and 1 ml of 1m hno3 pipetted for eluting the metals from the binding gels elution was done for a minimum of 24 h before the samples were diluted and analysed with the icp ms 2 3 soil solution immediately after retrieving the devices the concentration of metals in the soil solution were determined by transferring the soil from which devices were retrieved into 50 ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min a 1 ml aliquot was taken from these further centrifuged diluted with 0 1m hno3 and analysed with icp ms zhang et al 2006 2 4 calculation 2 4 1 time integrated concentrations cdgt the dgt measurement gives the time integrated concentrations c dgt of pollutants over the deployment period mass of metal bind by the resin gel m can be calculated from equation 1 by using the concentration ce obtained from analysing the elution sample with icp ms 1 m c e v a c i d v g e l f e where f e is an elution factor of 0 8 that compensates for the fraction of metals that cannot be released from the chelating resin zhang and davison 1995 v acid represent the volume of 1m hno3 used for eluting metal from the resin gel v gel stands for gel volume thus c dgt can be calculated from equation 2 once the mass m obtained in equation 1 is known 2 c d g t m δ g d a t where δg is the diffusive layer thickness diffusive gel and filter paper t is the time for deployment d is the diffusion coefficient and a represent exposed area of the soil to soil solution davison and zhang 1994 2 4 2 index of resupply r index of resupply r is defined as the ratio of the dgt measured time integrated concentration cdgt to the independently measured soil solution concentration csoln it is represented in equation 3 and it s an indication of the ability of the soil solid phase to resupply the analyte to soil solution its value varies between 0 and 1 r value close to 1 indicate very rapid resupply of the analyte from the soil particles to the soil solution which means fast depletion harper et al 2000 3 r c d g t c s o l n the r value can be used as a measure of the depletion of soil solution concentration at the dgt medium interface ernstberger et al 2002 zhang et al 2006 2 4 3 the distribution coefficient kd the distribution coefficient kd estimated in equation 4 is the ratio of the concentration of the labile analyte associated with the solid phase to the concentration in soil solution lehto et al 2008 it can be explained to represent the labile pool size which is the adsorbed species that can be available for dgt measurement di bonito et al 2008 harper et al 2000 4 k d c s o l i d p h a s e c s o i l s o l u t i o n where csolid phase is the concentration of each metal obtained by extraction with 0 01m cacl2 and csoil solution is the concentration of metal in the soil solution obtained by centrifugation high kd value imply that the analyte had been retained by the solid phase through adsorption whereas low value means the opposite that is high amount of the analyte is occurring in the soil solution 2 4 4 response time tc and desorption rate constant k 1 equation 5 showed a relationship between the response time and the dissociation rate constant from the equation the response time tc can be expressed as the inverse of the dissociation rate constant shown in equation 5 harper et al 2000 5 t c 1 k 1 k 1 engaging the difs model enabled us to quantify the relationship between r kd and tc provided the input parameters of soil porosity ɸ particle size pc and diffusion coefficients of the metal ions in the soil ds are known these parameters are shown in equations 6 8 below harper et al 1998 6 p c m v 7 ϕ d p p c d p 8 d s d o 1 ln φ 2 the total mass of the soil particles is represented by m v stands for the porewater volume in a particular or given volume of total soil dp represent the soil density while do is the diffusion coefficient of the metal ions in water the dissociation rate constant k 1 is thus estimated using equation 9 harper et al 2000 9 k 1 1 1 k d p c t c 3 results and discussion 3 1 metal concentration available in soil solutions css the result of the available concentration of metal present in the soil solution shown in table 2 revealed that all the control soil samples have the highest soil solution concentration of pb cu and cd ions a reduction in the css of all studied metals was observed in the treated soils from table 2 the concentration of metal ions in the soil solution an indicator of their availability of the soils treated with biochar were lower than the concentration obtained in all the delonix regia treated soil the nature and modification that each of the treatment had been subjected to which consequently affect its ability to adsorb metal ions might be the major factor responsible for the noticed difference biochar has been shown to behave as an efficient sorbent for various contaminants either organic or inorganic due to its large surface area and special structure tang et al 2013 a similar reduction in bioavailability of several heavy metals cu zn ni cd and pb on application of biochar was reported by méndez et al 2012 and karami et al 2011 the css of the metal ions in ilesha soil both treated and untreated was the lowest and from table 1 this soil has the highest cec which is a parameter that is very important in determining the ability of soil particles to adsorb metal ions ife soils recorded the highest values of css because it has the lowest cec out of all the soil samples used in this work since it is generally accepted that metals get to plants roots from the soil solution from our result it thus implied that the metal ions that can be supplied to dgt devices plants after treating these contaminated soils with either biochar or delonix regia material are reduced mclaughlin 2001 3 2 dgt measured labile concentration cdgt the dgt technique removes metal continuously to a chelex resin gel which acts as a sink after it has diffused through the diffusive gel of a well defined thickness davison and zhang 1994 the dgt technique thus mimics the removal of metal ions that occur at the root soil interface thereby inducing metal supply from solid phase to solution davison et al 2000 researches had been carried out by zhang et al 2001 song et al 2004 zhang et al 2004 nowack et al 2004 nolan et al 2004 and zhao et al 2006 to substantiate the good relationship that exist between metal concentrations in plants and metal accumulated by the dgt devices thus cdgt which is the concentration of metal measured by dgt technique is a good indicator of the metal concentration that could be accumulated by various plant parts the results in table 3 obtained for the cdgt over the deployment period showed that metal ions cdgt were highest in all control soils while biochar treated soils had lowest concentration lead cdgt in biochar treated soils were extremely low with values between 0 0004 and 0 0041 mg l while delonix regia treated soils have intermediate values of 0 0014 0 1778 mg l these values are in between the values for the control and the biochar treated soils considering the three metal ions studied here it was discovered that pb cdgt was the lowest this might be dependent on the characteristics of individual metal ions the difference is probably due to its large electronegativity of 2 3 compared with other metals having 1 9 and 1 7 for copper and cadmium respectively it means that the recorded cdgt for each metal would be the amount that would be accumulated to plants after treatment with any of the treatment materials used in this work presented in table 4 is the statistical analysis obtained for the paired mean test at 95 confidence interval level for the results in tables 2 and 3 the result showed that there is no significant correlation between the tested pairs this could be because after treatment of contaminated soils with both biochar and delonix regia it is expected that there should be difference in the concentrations of each metal in the soil solution and that adsorbed by the dgt devices in the treated and control soils 3 3 the index of resupply r value the equation for the index of resupply from the solid phase is shown in equation 3 the closer the values obtained are to unity is an indication of a rapid resupply of metal from the solid phase to the solution that is values close to unity 1 is the sustained case a case where there is continous resupply from the solid phase is able to maintain cdgt close to the soil solution concentration mundus et al 2012 r 0 8 means rapid and sustained supply from the solid phase r 0 1 imply that resupply is low and that there is limited mobilization of metals from the solid phase after depletion of the soil solution that is virtually no resupply from solid phase and 0 1 r 0 8 is an intermediate case conesa et al 2010 if we compare the values of metal concentrations in tables 2 and 3 for soil solution and cdgt respectively we clearly see that there is distinct reduction in cdgt soils thus the values of r obtained in all soil samples were less than 1 higher concentration of cdgt measurements could occur if an extra reduction of metal ions has taken place during the dgt deployment davison et al 2007 from the result in table 5 the control samples of ilesha soils were able to resupply each of the metals studied moderately back to soil solution as the r value ranged from 0 42 to 0 63 while the control samples for the other two soils ife and ijero had r values between 0 10 and 0 34 which indicate poor resupply copper had the highest index of resupply between 0 69 and 0 81 in the biochar treated soils followed by delonix regia 0 21 and 0 54 and the control soil samples have the lowest resupply between 0 18 and 0 40 the values are indication that the buffering capacity of biochar treated soils for copper is high and thus copper in the solid phase could be resupplied to soil solution easily in biochar treated soils than in those treated with delonix regia the result showed that the index of cadmium resupply in delonix regia treated soils is close to what was obtained in the control soil samples as r values for the resupply of cadmium in delonix regia treated soils and control were between 0 12 and 0 52 and 0 10 and 0 42 respectively for biochar treated soils the values were below detection limit bdl this is an indication that the biochar treated soils were not able to resupply bound cd into soil solution whereas the resupply was poor in the control and delonix regia treated soils the resupply index of pb in biochar treated soils were between 0 11 and 0 45 lower than what is obtained in the delonix regia treated soils where r were in the rage of 0 13 0 63 in the study by zhang et al 2006 on the kinetics of zinc and cadmium release in two sets of fourteen freshly contaminated soils it was found that values of r for some soils sensibly ranged from 0 07 cd and 0 11 zn indicating poor buffering from solid phase resupply of the concentration in soil solution to 0 95 cd and 0 92 zn indicating good buffering conesa et al 2010 reported r values between 0 001 and 0 056 for cu pb and cd in mine tailings when dgt devices were deployed to assess the influence of ph on concentration of metal uptake by the devices 3 4 labile pool size kd value the distribution coefficient kd is expressed in equation 4 high kd values imply that the metal species has been retained by the solid phase through adsorption but when kd is low it means high amount of the metal species are partitioning into soil solution the experimental result showed that biochar treated soils have the highest kd values in all the soils and for all metals considered the values were cu was at least 2400 times more cd was at least 200 times more pb was at least 700 times more than the kd in delonix regia treated samples the result is an indication that a large proportion of the metals in the biochar treated soils are in soil solid phase labile and can be redistributed to soil solution in this work the labile pool size of metals pb cu and cd that can be resupplied to soil solution from the soil solid phase follows this order biochar treated soils delonix regia treated soils the distribution coefficient of lead showed the highest values in the soil samples this was followed by that of copper while cadmium had the lowest kd values 3 5 response time to depletion tc comparing the r values obtained from the deployment of dgt devices over different periods of time with the modelled r values obtained from difs it is possible to have an estimation of a parameter referred to as the soil response time to depletion tc for the particular metal ion or any soil content under consideration tc is defined as the time required for the disequilibria of either labile metals or any particular soil constituent initiated or induced by dgt to revert to 63 of the equilibrium value honeyman and santschi 1988 in table 6 where the result for the response time for the system is shown it is seen that the ilesha and ife soil samples that were treated with biochar have low tc values for copper and cadmium desorption the result could be an indication that soils possessing moderate to high cation exchange capacity showed low tc values with biochar treatment the resupply of bound metal ions to the solid phase in biochar treated soil is faster than the rate at which the resupply occurred in delonix regia treated soil samples each metal ions in the biochar treated soil had very large coefficient of distribution but at the same time a very fast response time to depletion of bound metal ions into the liquid phase also occurred ijero soil registered the longest response time irrespective of the treatment applied while ilesha and ife soils had the shorter response times the observed trend of tc in this work where shortest tc was recorded in soil with more clay content was also reported by zhang et al 2006 where shorter response times were observed in clay soils for the realize of zn and cd the tc for cu in the control soils was very long at the beginning day 5 but gradually became shorter as aging progressed in the treated soils tc for copper in the biochar treated soils were lower faster response time than in the delonix regia treated soils that is it will take longer time for cu ions adsorbed to the soil solid phase to be released or resupplied into soil solution in delonix regia treated soils but the tc could not be obtained for cd in all biochar treated soil because the input data were below the detection limit of the machine icpms used for analysis cd tc in delonix regia treated soils were in the range of 1400s 3600s in ijero soil 52 84s and 470 3s in ilesha soil which were in most cases longer than the response time values obtained in the control samples lead tc in ilesha and ife soils treated with biochar recorded long response time tc values in some cases these values were higher than the tc recorded in their control soils lead tc were extremely low in some delonix regia treated soils while its values were also higher than the recorded tc in some control soils although the type of metal considered affected the response time but the shortest responses were recorded in ijero and ife soils the response observed could be as a result of poor soil organic matter low ph and low cec in these soils because all these are factors that contribute to the response time to depletion of metal ions or any soil constituent in the soil 3 6 the desorption rate constant k 1 values of the desorption or resupply rate constant k 1 are obtained by inputting the values of tc pc and kd into equation 7 the values of k 1 obtained for both pre and post remediation are shown in table 7 lowest desorption rate constants were generally produced from soils with highest values of tc that is soil with the longest response time to depletion the result showed that soils treated with biochar had lower values of k 1 compared to their control soils the only exception i e with high k 1 value in respect to their controls were found in biochar treated soil of ijero soil for desorption of cu and for desorption of cadmium in ilesha soil while for delonix regia treated soil cd desorption rate constant in ilesha and ife soils and pb desorption in ijero soil were higher than the obtained values for their respective control samples the implication of the result is that the soils with higher k 1 is fast in the release of bounded metal ions to it while those with lower k 1 signified that metal ions are strongly attached to the solid phase of the soil more retained and thus a slower desorption occur considering copper ions desorption in the treated soils all the k 1 values were higher in the biochar treated soils except in ife soil than recorded in the delonix regia treated soils for cadmium ion it was discovered that delonix regia treated ife soil recorded the highest value of k 1 while ilesha biochar treated soil had the highest value of k 1 the desorption rate constant of lead in biochar treated soils were lower than in delonix regia treated soils this is an indication that the desorption of lead from biochar treated soils is slower than in the soils treated with delonix regia implying that biochar treatment could be more effective in the treatment of lead than the use of delonix regia in most soils delonix regia treated soils had lower values than biochar treated soils for the desorption of cu and cd while biochar treated soils had lower values for pb desorption 4 conclusion this work is focussed on the assessment of the application of biochar and delonix regia as treatments on soils contaminated with lead copper and cadmium ions using soil solution concentration dgt measurement and engaging the use of difs models to obtain soil kinetic parameters the dgt technique is an established procedure used successfully to assess the kinetics of resupply and the bioavailability of metals to plants and by engaging the difs model it has been possible to assess the fluxes of metals in soils and sediments without disrupting the physical chemical equilibrium of the system apart from the inherent advantages above associated with its usage its ease of handling and deployment in soils is another added advantage derived from it these make it very appropriate for use in this research work the result obtained showed that there is reduction in the soil solution concentration and dgt measured concentrations of these metal ions after the application of each treatments and thus there is a reduction in the potential risk that their presence can cause the order for kd obtained in this study showed that biochar treated soil had higher values than delonix regia treated soils while the control soil samples had the lowest values for the response time tc result revealed that the resupply of available metal into the soil solution is fastest in the biochar treated soils with the order being control samples delonix regia treated soils biochar treated soils this trend is the general observation for desorption rate constant and this further confirmed that the control soils resupply its available metal to soil solution at much slower rate than the treated soils of which the resupply in biochar treated soils were faster than in delonix regia treated soils furthermore from the values of k 1 obtained the study showed that biochar treatment is effective for lead removal while both treatments are effective for copper but none is effective for the removal of cadmium from this work we conclude that the kinetic parameters of remediated soils be looked at critically to ascertain the response time of resupply of adsorbed metal ions further studies are needed to determine the effects of temperature ph soil organic content ionic strength and other physic chemical parameters on the exchange kinetics of metals in different soil

exchange or desorption k 1 of metal ions between soil solid phase and soil solution as obtained using the dgt induced fluxes in soils difs model 2 experimental 2 1 soil properties and amendment the properties of the soil samples obtained at a depth of 0 20 cm from cities in the south western part of nigeria ife ilesha and ijero ekiti is shown in table 1 the results on soil properties showed that the soil samples were extremely poor in organic matter after air drying and sieving through a 2 mm mesh 1 5 kg each of the samples was contaminated with minimum allowable limits pb cu and cd in agricultural soils i e 100 mg pb kg 100 mg cu kg and 5 mg cd kg and incubated for seven days before it was divided into approximately three equal parts one part was homogenously mixed with 2 w w of biochar the second part was mixed with 2 delonix regia pods and the third part without amendment was designated as control all study on samples control and treatments were carried out in triplicates 2 2 deployment of dgt devices nitric acid 10 was used to wash all the experimental apparatuses and the dgt plastic moulds overnight and they were subsequently rinsed with ultra pure water before use chelex binding gels diffusive gels and the dgt devices were prepared and the dgt experimental set up were carried out as described by houben et al 2013 and zhang and davison 1999 certain amount 100g of soil contaminated or controls and treated prepared following the procedures in babalola and zhang 2020 were weighed and mixed with ultra pure mq water to 80 of its maximum water holding capacity the well mixed soil was allowed to equilibrate and divided into three clean pots the acid washed dgt devices with 0 8 mm diffusive and 0 4 mm resin gels layers were deployed after smearing its surface with some of the soil slurry and the set up was covered to prevent water loss the devices were deployed on day 5 21 and day 42 noting the average temperature at the expiration of the 24 h deployment each device was retrieved and the surface rinsed by spraying a jet of water to remove soil particles on opening the binding gels were removed and transferred into clean 1 5 ml centrifuge tubes and 1 ml of 1m hno3 pipetted for eluting the metals from the binding gels elution was done for a minimum of 24 h before the samples were diluted and analysed with the icp ms 2 3 soil solution immediately after retrieving the devices the concentration of metals in the soil solution were determined by transferring the soil from which devices were retrieved into 50 ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min a 1 ml aliquot was taken from these further centrifuged diluted with 0 1m hno3 and analysed with icp ms zhang et al 2006 2 4 calculation 2 4 1 time integrated concentrations cdgt the dgt measurement gives the time integrated concentrations c dgt of pollutants over the deployment period mass of metal bind by the resin gel m can be calculated from equation 1 by using the concentration ce obtained from analysing the elution sample with icp ms 1 m c e v a c i d v g e l f e where f e is an elution factor of 0 8 that compensates for the fraction of metals that cannot be released from the chelating resin zhang and davison 1995 v acid represent the volume of 1m hno3 used for eluting metal from the resin gel v gel stands for gel volume thus c dgt can be calculated from equation 2 once the mass m obtained in equation 1 is known 2 c d g t m δ g d a t where δg is the diffusive layer thickness diffusive gel and filter paper t is the time for deployment d is the diffusion coefficient and a represent exposed area of the soil to soil solution davison and zhang 1994 2 4 2 index of resupply r index of resupply r is defined as the ratio of the dgt measured time integrated concentration cdgt to the independently measured soil solution concentration csoln it is represented in equation 3 and it s an indication of the ability of the soil solid phase to resupply the analyte to soil solution its value varies between 0 and 1 r value close to 1 indicate very rapid resupply of the analyte from the soil particles to the soil solution which means fast depletion harper et al 2000 3 r c d g t c s o l n the r value can be used as a measure of the depletion of soil solution concentration at the dgt medium interface ernstberger et al 2002 zhang et al 2006 2 4 3 the distribution coefficient kd the distribution coefficient kd estimated in equation 4 is the ratio of the concentration of the labile analyte associated with the solid phase to the concentration in soil solution lehto et al 2008 it can be explained to represent the labile pool size which is the adsorbed species that can be available for dgt measurement di bonito et al 2008 harper et al 2000 4 k d c s o l i d p h a s e c s o i l s o l u t i o n where csolid phase is the concentration of each metal obtained by extraction with 0 01m cacl2 and csoil solution is the concentration of metal in the soil solution obtained by centrifugation high kd value imply that the analyte had been retained by the solid phase through adsorption whereas low value means the opposite that is high amount of the analyte is occurring in the soil solution 2 4 4 response time tc and desorption rate constant k 1 equation 5 showed a relationship between the response time and the dissociation rate constant from the equation the response time tc can be expressed as the inverse of the dissociation rate constant shown in equation 5 harper et al 2000 5 t c 1 k 1 k 1 engaging the difs model enabled us to quantify the relationship between r kd and tc provided the input parameters of soil porosity ɸ particle size pc and diffusion coefficients of the metal ions in the soil ds are known these parameters are shown in equations 6 8 below harper et al 1998 6 p c m v 7 ϕ d p p c d p 8 d s d o 1 ln φ 2 the total mass of the soil particles is represented by m v stands for the porewater volume in a particular or given volume of total soil dp represent the soil density while do is the diffusion coefficient of the metal ions in water the dissociation rate constant k 1 is thus estimated using equation 9 harper et al 2000 9 k 1 1 1 k d p c t c 3 results and discussion 3 1 metal concentration available in soil solutions css the result of the available concentration of metal present in the soil solution shown in table 2 revealed that all the control soil samples have the highest soil solution concentration of pb cu and cd ions a reduction in the css of all studied metals was observed in the treated soils from table 2 the concentration of metal ions in the soil solution an indicator of their availability of the soils treated with biochar were lower than the concentration obtained in all the delonix regia treated soil the nature and modification that each of the treatment had been subjected to which consequently affect its ability to adsorb metal ions might be the major factor responsible for the noticed difference biochar has been shown to behave as an efficient sorbent for various contaminants either organic or inorganic due to its large surface area and special structure tang et al 2013 a similar reduction in bioavailability of several heavy metals cu zn ni cd and pb on application of biochar was reported by méndez et al 2012 and karami et al 2011 the css of the metal ions in ilesha soil both treated and untreated was the lowest and from table 1 this soil has the highest cec which is a parameter that is very important in determining the ability of soil particles to adsorb metal ions ife soils recorded the highest values of css because it has the lowest cec out of all the soil samples used in this work since it is generally accepted that metals get to plants roots from the soil solution from our result it thus implied that the metal ions that can be supplied to dgt devices plants after treating these contaminated soils with either biochar or delonix regia material are reduced mclaughlin 2001 3 2 dgt measured labile concentration cdgt the dgt technique removes metal continuously to a chelex resin gel which acts as a sink after it has diffused through the diffusive gel of a well defined thickness davison and zhang 1994 the dgt technique thus mimics the removal of metal ions that occur at the root soil interface thereby inducing metal supply from solid phase to solution davison et al 2000 researches had been carried out by zhang et al 2001 song et al 2004 zhang et al 2004 nowack et al 2004 nolan et al 2004 and zhao et al 2006 to substantiate the good relationship that exist between metal concentrations in plants and metal accumulated by the dgt devices thus cdgt which is the concentration of metal measured by dgt technique is a good indicator of the metal concentration that could be accumulated by various plant parts the results in table 3 obtained for the cdgt over the deployment period showed that metal ions cdgt were highest in all control soils while biochar treated soils had lowest concentration lead cdgt in biochar treated soils were extremely low with values between 0 0004 and 0 0041 mg l while delonix regia treated soils have intermediate values of 0 0014 0 1778 mg l these values are in between the values for the control and the biochar treated soils considering the three metal ions studied here it was discovered that pb cdgt was the lowest this might be dependent on the characteristics of individual metal ions the difference is probably due to its large electronegativity of 2 3 compared with other metals having 1 9 and 1 7 for copper and cadmium respectively it means that the recorded cdgt for each metal would be the amount that would be accumulated to plants after treatment with any of the treatment materials used in this work presented in table 4 is the statistical analysis obtained for the paired mean test at 95 confidence interval level for the results in tables 2 and 3 the result showed that there is no significant correlation between the tested pairs this could be because after treatment of contaminated soils with both biochar and delonix regia it is expected that there should be difference in the concentrations of each metal in the soil solution and that adsorbed by the dgt devices in the treated and control soils 3 3 the index of resupply r value the equation for the index of resupply from the solid phase is shown in equation 3 the closer the values obtained are to unity is an indication of a rapid resupply of metal from the solid phase to the solution that is values close to unity 1 is the sustained case a case where there is continous resupply from the solid phase is able to maintain cdgt close to the soil solution concentration mundus et al 2012 r 0 8 means rapid and sustained supply from the solid phase r 0 1 imply that resupply is low and that there is limited mobilization of metals from the solid phase after depletion of the soil solution that is virtually no resupply from solid phase and 0 1 r 0 8 is an intermediate case conesa et al 2010 if we compare the values of metal concentrations in tables 2 and 3 for soil solution and cdgt respectively we clearly see that there is distinct reduction in cdgt soils thus the values of r obtained in all soil samples were less than 1 higher concentration of cdgt measurements could occur if an extra reduction of metal ions has taken place during the dgt deployment davison et al 2007 from the result in table 5 the control samples of ilesha soils were able to resupply each of the metals studied moderately back to soil solution as the r value ranged from 0 42 to 0 63 while the control samples for the other two soils ife and ijero had r values between 0 10 and 0 34 which indicate poor resupply copper had the highest index of resupply between 0 69 and 0 81 in the biochar treated soils followed by delonix regia 0 21 and 0 54 and the control soil samples have the lowest resupply between 0 18 and 0 40 the values are indication that the buffering capacity of biochar treated soils for copper is high and thus copper in the solid phase could be resupplied to soil solution easily in biochar treated soils than in those treated with delonix regia the result showed that the index of cadmium resupply in delonix regia treated soils is close to what was obtained in the control soil samples as r values for the resupply of cadmium in delonix regia treated soils and control were between 0 12 and 0 52 and 0 10 and 0 42 respectively for biochar treated soils the values were below detection limit bdl this is an indication that the biochar treated soils were not able to resupply bound cd into soil solution whereas the resupply was poor in the control and delonix regia treated soils the resupply index of pb in biochar treated soils were between 0 11 and 0 45 lower than what is obtained in the delonix regia treated soils where r were in the rage of 0 13 0 63 in the study by zhang et al 2006 on the kinetics of zinc and cadmium release in two sets of fourteen freshly contaminated soils it was found that values of r for some soils sensibly ranged from 0 07 cd and 0 11 zn indicating poor buffering from solid phase resupply of the concentration in soil solution to 0 95 cd and 0 92 zn indicating good buffering conesa et al 2010 reported r values between 0 001 and 0 056 for cu pb and cd in mine tailings when dgt devices were deployed to assess the influence of ph on concentration of metal uptake by the devices 3 4 labile pool size kd value the distribution coefficient kd is expressed in equation 4 high kd values imply that the metal species has been retained by the solid phase through adsorption but when kd is low it means high amount of the metal species are partitioning into soil solution the experimental result showed that biochar treated soils have the highest kd values in all the soils and for all metals considered the values were cu was at least 2400 times more cd was at least 200 times more pb was at least 700 times more than the kd in delonix regia treated samples the result is an indication that a large proportion of the metals in the biochar treated soils are in soil solid phase labile and can be redistributed to soil solution in this work the labile pool size of metals pb cu and cd that can be resupplied to soil solution from the soil solid phase follows this order biochar treated soils delonix regia treated soils the distribution coefficient of lead showed the highest values in the soil samples this was followed by that of copper while cadmium had the lowest kd values 3 5 response time to depletion tc comparing the r values obtained from the deployment of dgt devices over different periods of time with the modelled r values obtained from difs it is possible to have an estimation of a parameter referred to as the soil response time to depletion tc for the particular metal ion or any soil content under consideration tc is defined as the time required for the disequilibria of either labile metals or any particular soil constituent initiated or induced by dgt to revert to 63 of the equilibrium value honeyman and santschi 1988 in table 6 where the result for the response time for the system is shown it is seen that the ilesha and ife soil samples that were treated with biochar have low tc values for copper and cadmium desorption the result could be an indication that soils possessing moderate to high cation exchange capacity showed low tc values with biochar treatment the resupply of bound metal ions to the solid phase in biochar treated soil is faster than the rate at which the resupply occurred in delonix regia treated soil samples each metal ions in the biochar treated soil had very large coefficient of distribution but at the same time a very fast response time to depletion of bound metal ions into the liquid phase also occurred ijero soil registered the longest response time irrespective of the treatment applied while ilesha and ife soils had the shorter response times the observed trend of tc in this work where shortest tc was recorded in soil with more clay content was also reported by zhang et al 2006 where shorter response times were observed in clay soils for the realize of zn and cd the tc for cu in the control soils was very long at the beginning day 5 but gradually became shorter as aging progressed in the treated soils tc for copper in the biochar treated soils were lower faster response time than in the delonix regia treated soils that is it will take longer time for cu ions adsorbed to the soil solid phase to be released or resupplied into soil solution in delonix regia treated soils but the tc could not be obtained for cd in all biochar treated soil because the input data were below the detection limit of the machine icpms used for analysis cd tc in delonix regia treated soils were in the range of 1400s 3600s in ijero soil 52 84s and 470 3s in ilesha soil which were in most cases longer than the response time values obtained in the control samples lead tc in ilesha and ife soils treated with biochar recorded long response time tc values in some cases these values were higher than the tc recorded in their control soils lead tc were extremely low in some delonix regia treated soils while its values were also higher than the recorded tc in some control soils although the type of metal considered affected the response time but the shortest responses were recorded in ijero and ife soils the response observed could be as a result of poor soil organic matter low ph and low cec in these soils because all these are factors that contribute to the response time to depletion of metal ions or any soil constituent in the soil 3 6 the desorption rate constant k 1 values of the desorption or resupply rate constant k 1 are obtained by inputting the values of tc pc and kd into equation 7 the values of k 1 obtained for both pre and post remediation are shown in table 7 lowest desorption rate constants were generally produced from soils with highest values of tc that is soil with the longest response time to depletion the result showed that soils treated with biochar had lower values of k 1 compared to their control soils the only exception i e with high k 1 value in respect to their controls were found in biochar treated soil of ijero soil for desorption of cu and for desorption of cadmium in ilesha soil while for delonix regia treated soil cd desorption rate constant in ilesha and ife soils and pb desorption in ijero soil were higher than the obtained values for their respective control samples the implication of the result is that the soils with higher k 1 is fast in the release of bounded metal ions to it while those with lower k 1 signified that metal ions are strongly attached to the solid phase of the soil more retained and thus a slower desorption occur considering copper ions desorption in the treated soils all the k 1 values were higher in the biochar treated soils except in ife soil than recorded in the delonix regia treated soils for cadmium ion it was discovered that delonix regia treated ife soil recorded the highest value of k 1 while ilesha biochar treated soil had the highest value of k 1 the desorption rate constant of lead in biochar treated soils were lower than in delonix regia treated soils this is an indication that the desorption of lead from biochar treated soils is slower than in the soils treated with delonix regia implying that biochar treatment could be more effective in the treatment of lead than the use of delonix regia in most soils delonix regia treated soils had lower values than biochar treated soils for the desorption of cu and cd while biochar treated soils had lower values for pb desorption 4 conclusion this work is focussed on the assessment of the application of biochar and delonix regia as treatments on soils contaminated with lead copper and cadmium ions using soil solution concentration dgt measurement and engaging the use of difs models to obtain soil kinetic parameters the dgt technique is an established procedure used successfully to assess the kinetics of resupply and the bioavailability of metals to plants and by engaging the difs model it has been possible to assess the fluxes of metals in soils and sediments without disrupting the physical chemical equilibrium of the system apart from the inherent advantages above associated with its usage its ease of handling and deployment in soils is another added advantage derived from it these make it very appropriate for use in this research work the result obtained showed that there is reduction in the soil solution concentration and dgt measured concentrations of these metal ions after the application of each treatments and thus there is a reduction in the potential risk that their presence can cause the order for kd obtained in this study showed that biochar treated soil had higher values than delonix regia treated soils while the control soil samples had the lowest values for the response time tc result revealed that the resupply of available metal into the soil solution is fastest in the biochar treated soils with the order being control samples delonix regia treated soils biochar treated soils this trend is the general observation for desorption rate constant and this further confirmed that the control soils resupply its available metal to soil solution at much slower rate than the treated soils of which the resupply in biochar treated soils were faster than in delonix regia treated soils furthermore from the values of k 1 obtained the study showed that biochar treatment is effective for lead removal while both treatments are effective for copper but none is effective for the removal of cadmium from this work we conclude that the kinetic parameters of remediated soils be looked at critically to ascertain the response time of resupply of adsorbed metal ions further studies are needed to determine the effects of temperature ph soil organic content ionic strength and other physic chemical parameters on the exchange kinetics of metals in different soil

12011,this paper examines geothermal heat from groundwater in akaiwa city and the northeastern part of okayama city where precipitation is the second least in japan isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen and chemical compositions of 53 groundwater samples and 6 river water samples were analyzed to investigate the origin and flow modes to examine changes in water quality water samples were taken in okayama city in july 2015 and 2016 and in akaiwa city in july 2016 and february 2017 the groundwater samples consist of a mixture of asahi river and yoshii river water as well as local precipitation the chemical composition is ca2 hco3 the amount of precipitation contributing to the groundwater samples increases with an increase in distance from both rivers to inspect groundwater quality for geothermal heat pump systems the calcite and goethite precipitations are examined as scales the results demonstrate that shallow groundwater can be exploited for heat using an open type ground source heat pump system gshp however in the context of scaling iron materials such as goethite a closed type gshp is recommended graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater heat usage isotope geochemistry chemical composition 1 introduction geothermal heat pump are used for air conditioning in homes factories and agricultural greenhouses the ground source heat pump systems gshp utilizes the temperature difference between the underground soil groundwater temperature and the outside air ministry of the environment 2015 groundwater temperature remains roughly constant at a depth of 10 m and the groundwater layer is 1 c 2 c higher than the average terrestrial temperature e g yamamoto 1992 sekiya 2003 there are two types of gshp closed type and open type fig 1 in the closed type a heat exchange facility is installed by drilling a well and underground heat is recovered by passing heat containing fluid through a u shaped pipe the open heat pump type pumps groundwater directly from the ground closed type gshp is widely used over the world especially in regions where groundwater resources are not abundant and where water quality problems exist e g wang et al 2012 on the other hand in areas where groundwater flow is abundant open gshp is used to pump groundwater exchange heat and return it to the ground or drain it into canals and rivers our group has been studying the applicability of the open gshp for groundwater in toyama and fukui prefectures where there is a lot of precipitation and abundant groundwater iwatake et al 2013 yamada and ueda 2018 okakita et al 2019 in the toyama prefecture of japan where groundwater resources are abundant an open type gshp is used for heating and cooling of offices kushida et al 2012 the open type gshp has the advantage of higher geothermal recovery efficiency and lower initial cost than the closed type gshp e g wang et al 2012 as a new investment only heat pump equipment main body and related piping work can be done if there are offices and homes which have existing groundwater wells this study focused on okayama and akaiwa cities which have the second least precipitation in japan most residents in these cities use kerosene and electricity for house heating since the gigantic tohoku earthquake of march 11 2011 that resulted in the loss of the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station saving electric power has become an urgent necessity in japan and alternative energy resources are being sought air temperature in both akaiwa city and okayama city which are located in the southeastern region of okayama prefecture fig 2 a is roughly 30 c in summer and 0 c in winter fig 2b the annual average temperature is roughly 14 c japan meteorological agency 2020 therefore this paper estimates the temperature of groundwater in these areas to be about 17 c since vegetables and fruits are cultivated in both cities practical application of geothermal heat is desirable for agricultural purposes however the mode of flow water quality and the origin of groundwater in both cities are currently unknown to utilize an open type gshp it is necessary to maintain a stable groundwater supply stable water level and water temperature and optimal water quality depending on water quality precipitates called scales such as calcium carbonate calcite caco3 iron hydroxide ferrihydrite feooh and goethite fe oh 3 adhere to heat exchangers and piping which in turn reduces heat efficiency therefore when using an open type gshp it is important to accurately identify groundwater quality and flow studies examining groundwater flow and quality have been conducted in japan and overseas for the purpose of utilizing groundwater heat e g huttrer 1997 diao et al 2004 lee and hahn 2006 fujii et al 2007 russo et al

2014 garcía gil et al 2016 the purpose of this study is to investigate the applicability of a gshp for the heat utilization of groundwater in akaiwa city and the northeastern region of okayama city isotopic composition of hydrogen δd and oxygen δ18o in groundwater river water and precipitation as well as the major and minor chemical components were analyzed to investigate the groundwater flow pattern and water quality on the geochemical characteristics groundwater studies for heat use are generally limited to areas with low precipitation such as okayama and akaiwa there are many groundwater wells in these cities to use for the agriculture in this study the distribution of groundwater wells was investigated with the cooperation of both city offices in okayama city the groundwater was sampled in july 2015 and 2016 summer in akaiwa city groundwater was sampled in july 2016 summer and february 2017 winter to study seasonal changes in water quality in okayama city and akaiwa city precipitation was collected every month for one year from july 2016 the δd and δ18o values and water quality were examined to identify changes in water temperature and the origin of groundwater in akaiwa city groundwater flow was investigated by continuously observing groundwater level water temperature and electric conductivity ec in four wells from november 2017 to january 2020

isotope analyzers picarro l2120i and l2130i at the research institute for global environmental studies the results obtained are shown as deviation values for v smow with analytical errors of 1 for δd values and 0 15 for δ18o values 4 results and discussion the chemical and isotopic analyses of groundwater and river water are shown in tables 2 and 3 as well as in fig 5 through 12 the isotopic composition of precipitation and the groundwater trace analysis results are shown in tables 4 and 5 respectively the sample number in the table indicates the number of groundwater wells in this chapter in order to discuss the characteristics of groundwater in the study area water temperature and changes in ec values and water levels at four observation wells are discussed first next hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of groundwater and precipitation were investigated to discuss the origin of groundwater the characteristics of groundwater in the study area were discussed using the results of isotope and major chemical composition measurements and the principal component analysis next scale precipitation was examined when using gshp was examined and finally the region suitable for the open gshp and the region to use the closed gshp were selected in the study area 4 1 groundwater temperature fig 5a and b shows the results of water temperature and ec measurements for july 2016 respectively the groundwater temperature ranges from 15 4 c to 22 5 c throughout the area table 2 and is higher than the average temperature of 13 9 c japan meteorological agency 2020 in wake town adjacent to the east side of the study area on the other hand the temperature of river water ranges between 23 4 c and 28 1 c in the summer table 2e from fig 5a it is evident that the groundwater temperature is high in the downstream area of the asahi river and in the vicinity of the rivers in the upstream areas of the suna river and the yoshii river water temperature of river waters are shown by triangles and is increasing and reaching a constant value of roughly 16 c as the distance from the river increases the groundwater temperatures at the sampling points ok05 5a 26 5 c and 5b 25 5 c are adjacent wells and ok21 22 6 c in the downstream area of the asahi river ok09 28 1 c are higher than the temperatures at other sampling sites suggesting that river water permeates the groundwater at this points ground water samples from ok5a and ok5b were collected at water purification plant along asahi river where river water infiltrates over a short period of time at this location in contrast sampling sites ok06 ok7a and ok7c are also water purification plants along asahi river and the water temperatures are 17 2 c 19 6 c and 18 0 c respectively not so high as ok5a and ok5b these groundwaters are assumed to be a relatively slow inflow of river water fig 5c compares the water temperatures of groundwater in akaiwa city in summer and winter the broken line shows that the water temperatures are the same for both seasons from fig 5c it is evident that the water temperatures of the yoshii river and the suna river which flow through akaiwa city differ by roughly 20 c between winter and summer for groundwater however temperature differences are minimal and almost the same for the three areas ak01 ak02 and ak06 the former two are groundwaters near the suna river and the other is groundwater along the yoshii river fig 4a the groundwater temperature of sampling points ak02 and ak06 is continuously monitored by a ctd sensor figs 6 and 7 respectively the groundwater temperature of ak02 fluctuates slightly from 14 0 c to 16 5 c throughout the year and that of ak06 from 19 0 c to 20 5 c the maximum water temperature is around november for ak02 fig 6 and january for ak06 fig 7 which is about four months and six months later than the air temperature change respectively this indicates that these groundwaters are strongly affected by river water and the residence time is estimated to be 4 6 months 4 2 electric conductivity ec groundwater ec values range widely from 8 6 to 63 1 ms m whereas the river water ec values range from 7 2 to 13 6 ms m table 2 fig 5b shows the ec values of groundwater in july 2016 river water values are shown by triangles in the southern region of okayama city where the water temperature is high the ec value is low which supports the large infiltration of river water in this region the ec value of groundwater increases with an increase in distance from the asahi river fig 5b during the infiltration of river water the increase in ec can be attributed to the leaching of chemical components by reacting with rocks in the stratum fig 3d compares the ec values for groundwater in akaiwa city between july 2016 and february 2017 showing that the two values are similar among these the samples from ak08 and ak14 have higher ec values compared with other sample sites the ec values of groundwaters at sampling points ak08 and ak14 is continuously observed with water temperature and water level by a ctd sensor figs 8 and 9 respectively the ec values of these two groundwater samples fluctuate slightly over a year but remain high the groundwater at sampling point ak08 is in a 3 m deep well with a water level of 1 5 m table 1b which strongly reflects air temperature fluctuations however the ec values were almost constant 4 3 continuous observation of water temperature water level and ec of groundwater at four sites figs 6 9 show the results of continuously monitoring the water temperature ec values and water level by ctd sensors at four locations fig 4a the sampling site ak02 is located along the suna river north of the study area the well is 8 2 m deep and the water level is 1 m above the ground the ctd sensor was placed at 7 2 m table 1b the temperature of the groundwater at this location changed from 14 c to 17 c over the course of a year with the highest value recorded in december and the lowest in may fig 6a according to meteorological observation data in wake town the air temperature was the highest in july and the lowest in february therefore the groundwater at sampling point ak02 reflects the air temperature change after a delay of roughly 5 months and the change in water temperature was as small as 3 c compared with the change in air temperature fig 6c moreover from fig 5c it is evident that there are no differences in water temperature for ak02 between winter and summer this suggests that the water temperature was consistent during the sampling period in addition at ak02 the ec value of groundwater was synchronized with the water temperature variation which was only 1 ms m fig 6a although the water level did not change much throughout the year it increased by roughly 10 cm fig 6b immediately after heavy rain fig 2b on july 6 2018 because of the heavy rain the suna river collapsed and houses were flooded in the southern part of akaiwa city and the eastern part of okayama city okayama prefecture 2019b the sampling point ak06 is a well near the old river along the yoshii river in the past the water temperature at the shallow well has been recorded as roughly 17 c at a depth of 7 m after drilling more recently the water depth increased to 20 5 m and the water temperature increased to 20 c higher than other groundwater sites groundwater temperatures fluctuated slightly between 19 c and 20 5 c over 1 year they are high in january and low in june fig 7a as mentioned above after the heavy rain in july 2018 the water temperature increased sharply roughly by 1 c moreover the ec value also increased sharply from 30 to 38 ms m during this period the water level increased by roughly 20 cm fig 7b after which the water temperature remained constant except during november when it started to increase reaching a maximum in january fig 7a at this point diurnal variation in water temperature can be observed in comparison with other areas moreover the water temperature itself increased regularly from 19 6 c to roughly 19 8 c in the morning and at midnight fig 7c corresponding to the temperature change the ec value increased regularly from 26 to 28 ms m at midnight fig 7c the water level varied from day to day in particular it varied by several centimeters over a period of roughly 4 days fig 7c fig 7d shows the water level of the yoshii river at the tsuse observatory in the south of the study area ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism 2020 from which it is evident that the water level increased regularly by roughly 10 cm at night which affected the water temperature ec value and water level of the groundwater at ak06 the sampling point ak08 is a well located in the southernmost part of akaiwa city which is almost halfway between asahi river and suna river water temperature fluctuated significantly from 12 c in february to 20 c in september roughly 2 months after the recorded air temperature change fig 8a however the groundwater level did not change throughout the year fig 8b of the four groundwater locations the shallow well with a depth of 3 m saw the largest changes in water temperature table 1b suggesting that the well is susceptible to temperature changes the ec value was roughly 1 ms m higher in winter however sufficient observation data are not available because of equipment failure during this measurement period the sampling point ak14 is a well located along the suna river in the southern part of akaiwa city the maximum depth of this well is 30 m the ctd sensor was located 15 m deeper than the water level table 1b indeed the water level and ec value at ak14 were almost constant problems occurred during the measurement period moreover the water temperature was also constant except around march when it decreased regularly by roughly 0 3 c for sampling in july 2016 when the water level was shallow groundwater was pumped from the well the water temperature was 15 4 c and the ec value was 35 ms m table 2c this ec value is characteristically higher than those of other areas fig 5b in general for ak14 the ctd sensor recorded an ec value of 48 ms m which is higher than the value obtained in july thereby reflecting deeper groundwater 4 4 δd and δ18o of groundwater and river water groundwater δd and δ18o values range from 55 to 26 and 8 5 to 5 8 respectively table 3 the river water values from asahi river and yoshii river range from 55 to 50 for δd and 8 7 to 7 9 for δ18o and lower than groundwaters in contrast δd and δ18o values of suna river are 48 4 and 7 4 higher than those of asahi river and yoshii river table 3e the asahi river and yoshii river flow south from the chugoku mountains to the seto inland sea and suna river originates in the hills of the northern region of the city fig 4 the observed isotope differences between suna river and other two rivers are due to an altitude effect e g dansgaard 1964 waseda and nakai 1983 clark and fritz 1997 rong et al 2012 groundwater samples collected in okayama city during the summer of 2015 table 3a only analyzed for δ18o and 2016 table 3b have similar δ18o values fig 10a shows the relationship δd vs δ18o of the water samples in summer of 2016 in okayama city and akaiwa city shows the composition between two meteoric water lines δd 8δ18o 10 and δd 8δ18o 20 craig 1961 there is no clear difference in δd vs δ18o values between both cities a half of the water samples are higher in δd vs δ18o values than those of river waters and annual weight averaged values of precipitation observed at stations 1 and 2 in this study november 2016 october 2017 table 4 and at station 3 in 2011 2018 by fujiike 2017 broken circle in fig 9a fig 10b shows δd and δ18o values of groundwaters in summer and winter in akaiwa city it is characterized that both δd and δ18o values of groundwaters are higher than those of annual weight averaged values of precipitation and plotted between two meteoric water lines also d excess values of river waters in winter are higher than those in summer figs 10c and d shows the distribution of δd and δ18o values for groundwater sampled in july 2016 respectively the δd and δ18o values of the asahi river and yoshii river range from 55 to 50 and from 8 7 to 7 9 respectively whereas those of the suna river are as high as 49 and 7 4 river water values are shown by triangles in fig 10c and d according to fig 10b and c the δd and δ18o values for some groundwater samples taken along the asahi river are below 53 and 8 7 respectively indicating that river water infiltration took place which is consistent with the results predicted from water temperature and ec values the δd and δ18o values of groundwater in the central part of the study area ranged from 50 to 47 and from 8 0 to 7 2 respectively and many groundwater samples along the suna river and part of the yoshii river showed high isotopic compositions these groundwater samples have higher δd and δ18o values than those from the suna river and yoshii river waters 4 5 δd and δ18o of precipitation in this study the monthly isotopic composition of precipitation was observed at two stations fig 4a from november 2017 to october 2018 table 4 and fig 11 since groundwater is often a mixture of river water and precipitation the δd and δ18o values of precipitation was obtained to discuss the origin of groundwater the δd and δ18o values which range from 104 to 14 and 14 6 to 4 2 respectively have greater variations than groundwater and are plotted between the two meteoric water lines d excess values 10 and 20 fig 11a the δd and δ18o values of precipitation are the lowest in march and the monthly changes in said values are similar at the two stations fig 11b through 11e precipitation began to increase around june peaking in october fig 11e the d excess value was roughly 25 from november to february winter and roughly 10 in other seasons fig 11d ichiyanagi and tanoue 2016 reported that spatial distributions of δd δ18o slope and annual mean d excess of the local meteoric water line in precipitations at 56 sites across japan are 7 6 8 6 and 8 21 respectively similar findings have been reported elsewhere e g petit et al 1991 delmotte et al 2000 peng et al 2004 wassenaar et al 2011 windhorst et al 2013 katsuyama et al 2015 okakita et al 2018 the amount of annual precipitation was 1082 mm at station 1 in okayama city and 1355 mm at station 2 in akaiwa city table 4 which is similar to the annual precipitation from the meteorological data of wake town from 2015 to 2019 934 1484 mm mean 1290 mm japan meteorological agency 2020 from the observed δd and δ18o values and the precipitation amount the annual weighted averages for station 1 and station 2 are 61 and 70 for δd values and 9 3 and 10 5 for δ18o values respectively table 4 fig 11a according to fujiike 2017 the annual weighted average δd and δ18o values of precipitation at the observation point in mitsu town st 3 in fig 4a for 2011 2018 fluctuate dramatically 69 to 51 and 10 0 to 7 6 respectively broken circle in fig 10a and b the weighted mean values observed in this study over 1 year starting from november 2016 are approximal to the lower range of the values reported by fujiike 2017 if groundwater originates from precipitation and has a residence time of 1 year then its δd and δ18o values will be the annual mean of regional precipitation in this study because the δd and δ18o values of groundwater are higher than the annual weighted average of precipitation it is assumed that groundwater has a residence time of 1 year because three rivers were in the study area river water infiltration should be large moreover it is highly likely that the groundwater consists of precipitation and river water the δd and δ18o values of groundwater in three alluvial fans in the toyama prefecture show the composition between the annual weighted average of precipitation and river water it has been reported that with an increase in distance from the river the precipitation contribution increases iwatake et al 2013 okakita et al 2019 in this study area the annual weighted average values of precipitation as well as the δd and δ18o values of river water in summer are lower than those of groundwater moreover in winter those of river water are similar to those of groundwater this suggests that groundwater is a mixture of river water and seasonal precipitation 4 6 chemical composition of the groundwater the chemical composition of the groundwater and river water is shown in table 3 fig 12a and b shows stiff 1951 and piper diagrams piper 1944 of the composition of groundwater in summer and both in summer and winter respectively to investigate the characteristics of groundwater quality in the study area no significant differences can be seen in groundwater composition between winter and summer the groundwater samples mainly consist of ca2 hco3 type water with some exceptions with compositions similar to the river water from the asahi river and yoshii river the concentrations of dissolved components mainly ca2 and hco3 increase with an increase in distance from the rivers groundwater has been reported to react with rocks in the strata where the concentration of dissolved constituents increases during ground infiltration for instance it changes to ca2 hco3 type water in response to limestone e g iwatake et al 2013 in addition an increase in dissolved components can be observed from the northern region to the southern region of the study area therefore it is assumed that the residence time of groundwater in areas far from the asahi river and the yoshii river is longer than the residence time of groundwater in the vicinity of the rivers in the southern region mg2 and so4 2 components increased fig 12a one of the reasons for the increase in mg2 and so4 2 components is the fact that this area is reclaimed land fig 2 moreover it is likely that sulfate and mg salts are fully dissolved in this region the concentration of sio2 in groundwater is one of tools available for determining the residence time of groundwater e g marçais et al 2018 fig 12c shows the concentration of sio2 in groundwater in summer indicating that the concentration of sio2 is 13 3 50 1 mg l higher than that in river water 10 6 19 4 mg l table 3 iwatake et al 2013 reported that sio2 concentration of groundwaters in sho river alluvium fan toyama are 10 2 59 8 mg l and higher than those of river waters 8 9 mg l which are similar to the results in the study area the concentration of sio2 in groundwater along the asahi river is 20 mg l however it increases with an increase in distance from rivers in addition there are areas around the suna river where the sio2 concentration is high fig 12c it is concluded that groundwater residence times are relatively long in areas away from rivers which are in consistent with the results by water temperature and stable isotope compositions of groundwaters 4 7 principal component analysis of water samples principal component analysis pca laaksoharju et al 1999 was conducted to investigate the origin of groundwater and rock water reactions multivariate analysis software gel science pirouette le ver 3 11 was used for the analysis fig 13 shows the calculated results based on all nine items of na k ca2 mg2 cl hco3 so4 2 and sio2 concentrations and δ18o as target components analytical values were used for the groundwater and river water samples the precipitation composition was calculated on the basis of the observed data by fujiike 2017 at station 3 in the component matrix of the factor loadings of the first and second principal components obtained by the pca the factor loadings of k hco3 sio2 and δ18o are positive and those of na ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 are negative indicating the influence of seawater components in polder land formations in the study area precipitation shows the lowest values of 1st and 2nd principal components river water shows slightly higher values and groundwater has even higher values suggesting that leaching of dissolved components especially hco3 and sio2 is progressing due to reaction with rocks fig 13 groundwater at the sampling points ok18 ok02 ok03a and ok03b in the southern part of the study area have larger negative values for the 2nd principal components compared with other samples for these groundwater samples the concentrations of dissolved ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 are high this means that source of the mg2 and so4 2 come from marine origin 4 8 origin of groundwater the groundwater in the study area is characterized by low concentrations of dissolved components which increase with an increase in distance from the asahi river and yoshii river in addition the continuous observations of groundwater temperature and ec values in the four sites suggest that the groundwater temperature changes several months after the air temperature changes in the northern area of akaiwa city the groundwater δd and δ18o values showed a composition along the meteoric water line δd 8δ18o 10 and are higher or the same than those of river water they are considerably higher than the 2017 weighted average values for precipitation on the basis of the data the groundwater is a mixture of river water and precipitation though the infiltration of river water from the asahi river is large in okayama city the sampling points ok05a ok05b ok06 ok07a and ok07b were collected from wells of a water purification plant for water supply and are assumed to be the subsurface water of asahi river at these sites the δd and δ18o values of groundwater are similar but slightly higher to those of river water from the asahi river table 3a therefore the groundwater from the water treatment plant is assumed to consist mainly of river water mixed with water from precipitation this result is consistent with the mixing of precipitation in the groundwater near the sho river alluvial fan in the toyama prefecture iwatake et al 2013 in areas far from these rivers the groundwater δd and δ18o values are higher than those of the weighted average of precipitation even when taking into account past data therefore it is unlikely that precipitation remains for 1 year in addition considering the fact that the groundwater temperature changes several months after the air temperature changes it is estimated that in areas far from rivers precipitation infiltrates underground and gushes out several months later the δd and δ18o values of precipitation fluctuate widely from month to month the months with values higher than the weighted average of precipitation consist of november through to may excluding march fig 11a from the δd and δ18o values considering that the monthly precipitation increases from november to april it is estimated that precipitation entered the groundwater during the period the sampling site ak28 is the only hot spring sampled in this study with a water temperature of 32 c although it was only sampled in winter the hot spring water is characterized by a high hco3 content with very high δd and δ18o values 26 and 5 8 respectively table 3d and fig 10b hot spring water with a δd value of 20 has been reported in japan as geopressured brine however its δ18o value ranges from 0 to 8 and has a salt concentration similar to or higher than that of seawater e g ueda et al 2010 although the ec value of ak28 is 46 3 ms m which is higher than that of groundwater it is unlikely that it consists of geopressured brine since its low dissolved content to date the cause of these unusually high δd and δ18o values is unknown 4 9 examination of scale precipitation when an open type gshp is used groundwater is pumped and heat is exchanged on the ground accordingly caco3 calcite feooh ferrihydrite and fe oh 3 goethite scales may precipitate in the heat exchangers and pipes to examine the possibility of scale precipitation the saturation index s i of scale components was calculated using phreeqc software parkhurst and appelo 1999 the saturation index is shown as follows 1 s i l o g q k where q is the activity product ca2 co3 2 for calcite and k is the equilibrium constant when the s i exceeds 0 the dissolved groundwater components are saturated or supersaturated those dissolved components cannot dissolve in groundwater and deposited as precipitates in heat exchangers and groundwater pipes the results are shown in fig 14 from which it can be predicted that precipitation will not occur for caco3 because it is always unsaturated s i 0 fig 14a feooh is supersaturated in some groundwater fig 14b whereas fe oh 3 is always supersaturated fig 14c that increases with an increase in the ph level this indicates that it is highly likely that fe oh 3 will precipitate when groundwater is used fig 14d shows the concentrations of iron in groundwater which varies across the range of 1 4260 μg l it is assumed that the increase in iron concentration in the groundwater can be attributed to the difference in the redox potential of groundwater indeed an increase in iron concentration can be observed as the groundwater approaches the reduced state fig 14e in groundwater iron exists as fe2 and fe3 ions in the reduced state fe2 becomes the main chemical species and the fe concentration increases because the solubility increases here the relationship between the geology and iron concentration in groundwater is unknown but geological data do exist for ak18 in akaiwa city data from chubu geological laboratory inc here a corroded soil layer can be observed 7 m underground in other areas gravel and silt layers dominate and corrosive soil layers cannot be found suggesting that corrosive soil may have reduced groundwater in light of this information it is evident that iron scale may precipitate when groundwater with a high iron concentration is used for open type gshp one office kawada kogyo co ltd in nanto city toyama prefecture has been using an open type gshp for several years with groundwater with supersaturated iron scale the formation of iron scale has been confirmed in filters which are regularly cleaned kushida et al 2015 therefore although the iron scale precipitates an open type gshp can be used in areas where iron concentration is low 4 10 examination of heat utilization using groundwater in the study area from the δd and δ18o values and chemical composition of groundwater river water and precipitation the appropriate context of an open type gshp can be identified fig 15 for gshp the heat recovery rate increases when the temperature difference between the groundwater and air increases therefore an open type gshp is appropriate for the majority of areas in akaiwa city and in okayama city for areas far from the asahi river indeed significant differences cannot be observed in groundwater quality across the sampling sites although the dissolved components increase as the distance from the river increases the increase in concentration does not significantly effect on the use of open type gshp however in groundwater with high iron concentrations large amounts of iron scale will precipitate in heat exchangers in these circumstances a closed type gshp should be used 5 conclusions in this paper geothermal heat pump utilization was examined for akaiwa city and the northeastern region of okayama city the δd and δ18o values and the chemical composition of 53 groundwater samples and 6 river water samples were analyzed to investigate origin and flow mode for the origin of groundwater the analysis of the δd and δ18o values and chemical composition indicated that the groundwater around the asahi river is dominated by the river water moreover the water around the suna river is dominated by precipitation for the asahi river area the application of a gshp is difficult especially in the southern region because the temperature difference between air and groundwater is small alternatively in akaiwa city the water temperature is essentially constant throughout the year fluctuating several months after the air temperature changes therefore the temperature difference between the air and water is large and accordingly a gshp can be applied efficiently an open type gshp will require periodic cleaning specifically the filters as trace precipitation of iron scale is expected overall the results suggest that in akaiwa city and the northern region of okayama city an open type gshp can be utilized however for groundwater with high iron concentrations a closed type gshp should be used declaration of competing interest the

12011,this paper examines geothermal heat from groundwater in akaiwa city and the northeastern part of okayama city where precipitation is the second least in japan isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen and chemical compositions of 53 groundwater samples and 6 river water samples were analyzed to investigate the origin and flow modes to examine changes in water quality water samples were taken in okayama city in july 2015 and 2016 and in akaiwa city in july 2016 and february 2017 the groundwater samples consist of a mixture of asahi river and yoshii river water as well as local precipitation the chemical composition is ca2 hco3 the amount of precipitation contributing to the groundwater samples increases with an increase in distance from both rivers to inspect groundwater quality for geothermal heat pump systems the calcite and goethite precipitations are examined as scales the results demonstrate that shallow groundwater can be exploited for heat using an open type ground source heat pump system gshp however in the context of scaling iron materials such as goethite a closed type gshp is recommended graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater heat usage isotope geochemistry chemical composition 1 introduction geothermal heat pump are used for air conditioning in homes factories and agricultural greenhouses the ground source heat pump systems gshp utilizes the temperature difference between the underground soil groundwater temperature and the outside air ministry of the environment 2015 groundwater temperature remains roughly constant at a depth of 10 m and the groundwater layer is 1 c 2 c higher than the average terrestrial temperature e g yamamoto 1992 sekiya 2003 there are two types of gshp closed type and open type fig 1 in the closed type a heat exchange facility is installed by drilling a well and underground heat is recovered by passing heat containing fluid through a u shaped pipe the open heat pump type pumps groundwater directly from the ground closed type gshp is widely used over the world especially in regions where groundwater resources are not abundant and where water quality problems exist e g wang et al 2012 on the other hand in areas where groundwater flow is abundant open gshp is used to pump groundwater exchange heat and return it to the ground or drain it into canals and rivers our group has been studying the applicability of the open gshp for groundwater in toyama and fukui prefectures where there is a lot of precipitation and abundant groundwater iwatake et al 2013 yamada and ueda 2018 okakita et al 2019 in the toyama prefecture of japan where groundwater resources are abundant an open type gshp is used for heating and cooling of offices kushida et al 2012 the open type gshp has the advantage of higher geothermal recovery efficiency and lower initial cost than the closed type gshp e g wang et al 2012 as a new investment only heat pump equipment main body and related piping work can be done if there are offices and homes which have existing groundwater wells this study focused on okayama and akaiwa cities which have the second least precipitation in japan most residents in these cities use kerosene and electricity for house heating since the gigantic tohoku earthquake of march 11 2011 that resulted in the loss of the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station saving electric power has become an urgent necessity in japan and alternative energy resources are being sought air temperature in both akaiwa city and okayama city which are located in the southeastern region of okayama prefecture fig 2 a is roughly 30 c in summer and 0 c in winter fig 2b the annual average temperature is roughly 14 c japan meteorological agency 2020 therefore this paper estimates the temperature of groundwater in these areas to be about 17 c since vegetables and fruits are cultivated in both cities practical application of geothermal heat is desirable for agricultural purposes however the mode of flow water quality and the origin of groundwater in both cities are currently unknown to utilize an open type gshp it is necessary to maintain a stable groundwater supply stable water level and water temperature and optimal water quality depending on water quality precipitates called scales such as calcium carbonate calcite caco3 iron hydroxide ferrihydrite feooh and goethite fe oh 3 adhere to heat exchangers and piping which in turn reduces heat efficiency therefore when using an open type gshp it is important to accurately identify groundwater quality and flow studies examining groundwater flow and quality have been conducted in japan and overseas for the purpose of utilizing groundwater heat e g huttrer 1997 diao et al 2004 lee and hahn 2006 fujii et al 2007 russo et al 2011 iwatake et al 2013 yamada and ueda 2018 in addition scholars have also examined the influence of heat and water quality changes when used groundwater is returned to its origin saito and komatsu 2014 garcía gil et al 2016 the purpose of this study is to investigate the applicability of a gshp for the heat utilization of groundwater in akaiwa city and the northeastern region of okayama city isotopic composition of hydrogen δd and oxygen δ18o in groundwater river water and precipitation as well as the major and minor chemical components were analyzed to investigate the groundwater flow pattern and water quality on the geochemical characteristics groundwater studies for heat use are generally limited to areas with low precipitation such as okayama and akaiwa there are many groundwater wells in these cities to use for the agriculture in this study the distribution of groundwater wells was investigated with the cooperation of both city offices in okayama city the groundwater was sampled in july 2015 and 2016 summer in akaiwa city groundwater was sampled in july 2016 summer and february 2017 winter to study seasonal changes in water quality in okayama city and akaiwa city precipitation was collected every month for one year from july 2016 the δd and δ18o values and water quality were examined to identify changes in water temperature and the origin of groundwater in akaiwa city groundwater flow was investigated by continuously observing groundwater level water temperature and electric conductivity ec in four wells from november 2017 to january 2020 2 outline of study area okayama and akaiwa cities are located along the seto inland sea in the southeastern region of okayama prefecture fig 2a their areas are 790 and 209 km2 with a population of 719 000 and 43 000 people respectively okayama prefecture 2019a okayama city measures 35 km from east to west and 47 7 km from north to south the southern area of okayama city is reclaimed land akaiwa city measures approximately 15 km from east to west and approximately 30 km from north to south with an annual precipitation of 1105 mm okayama prefecture has the 2nd lowest precipitation in japan okayama prefecture 2019a the northern part of okayama city forms part of the kibi plateau which is characterized by gentle hills as well as the asahi river and the yoshii river watershed areas of 1800 and 2060 km2 respectively both of which originate in the backbone of the chugoku mountains and flow into the seto inland sea the seto inland sea is located in the central urban area of the southern part of the okayama plain it is formed by the transport and sedimentation of the aforementioned two rivers the southern part of the okayama plain has been reclaimed land ever since the edo period it is mainly used for agricultural purposes specifically for grain production akaiwa city is located between the yoshii river and the asahi river on the east and west sides respectively in the center of the city the suna river which originates in the hills of the northern region of the city flows southward the basin which is long narrow and extends from north to south is separated from the asahi river and yoshii river by a watershed the area of the basin is 149 km2 much of the city is dominated by hills and forest its groundwater is primarily used for agriculture a geological map of the survey area is shown in fig 3 aist 2015 in the mountainous and hilly areas that run from the northern half of okayama city to the northern part of akaiwa city which is the southern part of the kibi plateau permian sandstone and mudstone layers gabbro rocks and basaltic volcanic rocks are distributed extending from the west southwest to the north northeast to the south granite rocks of the late cretaceous period are widely exposed in the central part of okayama city as well as in the suna river area of akaiwa city moreover alternate layers of sandstone and mudstone of the late triassic period are compactly distributed around the asahi river in the central part of okayama city late cretaceous dacite rhyolitic pyroclastic rocks which are contrasted with takada rhyolitic rocks widely distributed in the chugoku region can be found in several locations around the study area approximal to the southern margin of the granitoids and pyroclastic rocks the products of late cretaceous acid magmatism as well as additional sandstone and mudstone adducts from the middle to late permian period are continuously distributed in an east west direction the surface geology of the okayama plain excluding the reclaimed land in the southernmost part of okayama city extends south consisting mainly of holocene river and coastal plain deposits aist 2015 in the groundwater survey in okayama prefecture a survey was conducted at 31 points to examine the quality of groundwater according to article 15 of the water pollution control act okayama prefecture 2019a for akaiwa city detailed analyses of the main chemical constituents of groundwater have not been carried out to date 3 sampling and analytical methods data concerning the groundwater and river water locations are presented in table 1 and fig 4 a twenty one groundwater and three river water samples were collected in the southeastern region of okayama city on july 14 16 2015 the same groundwater except for sampling points ok04 ok12 and ok14 was sampled 1 year later in july 19 with new sampling points ok21 and ok22 to examine annual changes in water quality and composition tables 2 a and 2b in akaiwa city the summer samples were collected on july 18 20 2016 and the same winter samples on february 22 24 2017 except for sampling points ak10 ak13a ak13b ak18 ak24 and ak26 with new sampling points ak26 ak27a ak27b ak30 ak31 and ak32 tables 2 c and 2d to ensure consistency we attempted to collect groundwater samples from the same well however there were times when we could not collect groundwater samples from the same well due to the convenience of the well keeper one hot spring water sample ak28 was collected in february 2017 the latitude longitude and elevation of the sampling sites were confirmed by gps the surface elevation of the groundwater ranged between 3 and 296 m with the exception of some samples the elevation increased toward the north fig 4b water samples were collected in 250 and 100 ml plastic bottles for dissolved chemical components and stable isotope ratio after washing three times with sample water because the groundwater and river water samples were colorless and transparent filtration and acid treatment were not carried out in the field to analyze the iron and sio2 concentration of groundwater 50 ml of water filtered through a 0 2 μm membrane filter and given a ph level of 2 or less by adding 1 ml of 6 n hcl was sampled in the field measurement water temperature was measured using a digital waterproof thermometer yi chun electrics co ltd and the ph level was measured using a portable ph meter dkk toa hm 31p the electric conductivity ec was measured with a portable conductivity meter dkk toa cm 31p and the oxygen reduction potential orp was measured with an orp meter dkk toa rm 12p precipitation was collected every month for 1 year starting from november 2016 at two locations st 1 and st 2 in akaiwa city and okayama city fig 4a precipitation was sampled using the same method used in the study of okakita et al 2019 using a 30 cm diameter teflon funnel and stored in a 20 l tank a ping pong ball was placed in the center of the funnel to prevent evaporation isotope changes due to precipitation evaporation in the tank was confirmed to be within the acceptable range of analytical error okakita et al 2019 over the course of the study there was essentially no snowfall even during winter so precipitation was also collected using the aforementioned equipment in akaiwa city conductivity temperature and depth ctd sensors daiki rika kogyo co ltd dik 603c ctd recorder were installed at four wells groundwater level water temperature and ec were observed every 30 s from october 2017 to february 2020 to examine groundwater flow table 1b the major anion components cl no3 and so4 2 were measured using ion chromatography metrohm 761 compact ic cation na k ca2 and mg2 analysis was conducted using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer alkalinity was measured using the ph 4 8 acid titration method the sio2 concentration was measured by the molybdenum yellow colorimetric method using an absorption photometer shimazu uv vis spectrophotometer the charge balance of the obtained main chemical components was within 5 and the analytical error of the measured value was roughly 5 the δd and δ18o values of the water samples were analyzed using water isotope analyzers picarro l2120i and l2130i at the research institute for global environmental studies the results obtained are shown as deviation values for v smow with analytical errors of 1 for δd values and 0 15 for δ18o values 4 results and discussion the chemical and isotopic analyses of groundwater and river water are shown in tables 2 and 3 as well as in fig 5 through 12 the isotopic composition of precipitation and the groundwater trace analysis results are shown in tables 4 and 5 respectively the sample number in the table indicates the number of groundwater wells in this chapter in order to discuss the characteristics of groundwater in the study area water temperature and changes in ec values and water levels at four observation wells are discussed first next hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of groundwater and precipitation were investigated to discuss the origin of groundwater the characteristics of groundwater in the study area were discussed using the results of isotope and major chemical composition measurements and the principal component analysis next scale precipitation was examined when using gshp was examined and finally the region suitable for the open gshp and the region to use the closed gshp were selected in the study area 4 1 groundwater temperature fig 5a and b shows the results of water temperature and ec measurements for july 2016 respectively the groundwater temperature ranges from 15 4 c to 22 5 c throughout the area table 2 and is higher than the average temperature of 13 9 c japan meteorological agency 2020 in wake town adjacent to the east side of the study area on the other hand the temperature of river water ranges between 23 4 c and 28 1 c in the summer table 2e from fig 5a it is evident that the groundwater temperature is high in the downstream area of the asahi river and in the vicinity of the rivers in the upstream areas of the suna river and the yoshii river water temperature of river waters are shown by triangles and is increasing and reaching a constant value of roughly 16 c as the distance from the river increases the groundwater temperatures at the sampling points ok05 5a 26 5 c and 5b 25 5 c are adjacent wells and ok21 22 6 c in the downstream area of the asahi river ok09 28 1 c are higher than the temperatures at other sampling sites suggesting that river water permeates the groundwater at this points ground water samples from ok5a and ok5b were collected at water purification plant along asahi river where river water infiltrates over a short period of time at this location in contrast sampling sites ok06 ok7a and ok7c are also water purification plants along asahi river and the water temperatures are 17 2 c 19 6 c and 18 0 c respectively not so high as ok5a and ok5b these groundwaters are assumed to be a relatively slow inflow of river water fig 5c compares the water temperatures of groundwater in akaiwa city in summer and winter the broken line shows that the water temperatures are the same for both seasons from fig 5c it is evident that the water temperatures of the yoshii river and the suna river which flow through akaiwa city differ by roughly 20 c between winter and summer for groundwater however temperature differences are minimal and almost the same for the three areas ak01 ak02 and ak06 the former two are groundwaters near the suna river and the other is groundwater along the yoshii river fig 4a the groundwater temperature of sampling points ak02 and ak06 is continuously monitored by a ctd sensor figs 6 and 7 respectively the groundwater temperature of ak02 fluctuates slightly from 14 0 c to 16 5 c throughout the year and that of ak06 from 19 0 c to 20 5 c the maximum water temperature is around november for ak02 fig 6 and january for ak06 fig 7 which is about four months and six months later than the air temperature change respectively this indicates that these groundwaters are strongly affected by river water and the residence time is estimated to be 4 6 months 4 2 electric conductivity ec groundwater ec values range widely from 8 6 to 63 1 ms m whereas the river water ec values range from 7 2 to 13 6 ms m table 2 fig 5b shows the ec values of groundwater in july 2016 river water values are shown by triangles in the southern region of okayama city where the water temperature is high the ec value is low which supports the large infiltration of river water in this region the ec value of groundwater increases with an increase in distance from the asahi river fig 5b during the infiltration of river water the increase in ec can be attributed to the leaching of chemical components by reacting with rocks in the stratum fig 3d compares the ec values for groundwater in akaiwa city between july 2016 and february 2017 showing that the two values are similar among these the samples from ak08 and ak14 have higher ec values compared with other sample sites the ec values of groundwaters at sampling points ak08 and ak14 is continuously observed with water temperature and water level by a ctd sensor figs 8 and 9 respectively the ec values of these two groundwater samples fluctuate slightly over a year but remain high the groundwater at sampling point ak08 is in a 3 m deep well with a water level of 1 5 m table 1b which strongly reflects air temperature fluctuations however the ec values were almost constant 4 3 continuous observation of water temperature water level and ec of groundwater at four sites figs 6 9 show the results of continuously monitoring the water temperature ec values and water level by ctd sensors at four locations fig 4a the sampling site ak02 is located along the suna river north of the study area the well is 8 2 m deep and the water level is 1 m above the ground the ctd sensor was placed at 7 2 m table 1b the temperature of the groundwater at this location changed from 14 c to 17 c over the course of a year with the highest value recorded in december and the lowest in may fig 6a according to meteorological observation data in wake town the air temperature was the highest in july and the lowest in february therefore the groundwater at sampling point ak02 reflects the air temperature change after a delay of roughly 5 months and the change in water temperature was as small as 3 c compared with the change in air temperature fig 6c moreover from fig 5c it is evident that there are no differences in water temperature for ak02 between winter and summer this suggests that the water temperature was consistent during the sampling period in addition at ak02 the ec value of groundwater was synchronized with the water temperature variation which was only 1 ms m fig 6a although the water level did not change much throughout the year it increased by roughly 10 cm fig 6b immediately after heavy rain fig 2b on july 6 2018 because of the heavy rain the suna river collapsed and houses were flooded in the southern part of akaiwa city and the eastern part of okayama city okayama prefecture 2019b the sampling point ak06 is a well near the old river along the yoshii river in the past the water temperature at the shallow well has been recorded as roughly 17 c at a depth of 7 m after drilling more recently the water depth increased to 20 5 m and the water temperature increased to 20 c higher than other groundwater sites groundwater temperatures fluctuated slightly between 19 c and 20 5 c over 1 year they are high in january and low in june fig 7a as mentioned above after the heavy rain in july 2018 the water temperature increased sharply roughly by 1 c moreover the ec value also increased sharply from 30 to 38 ms m during this period the water level increased by roughly 20 cm fig 7b after which the water temperature remained constant except during november when it started to increase reaching a maximum in january fig 7a at this point diurnal variation in water temperature can be observed in comparison with other areas moreover the water temperature itself increased regularly from 19 6 c to roughly 19 8 c in the morning and at midnight fig 7c corresponding to the temperature change the ec value increased regularly from 26 to 28 ms m at midnight fig 7c the water level varied from day to day in particular it varied by several centimeters over a period of roughly 4 days fig 7c fig 7d shows the water level of the yoshii river at the tsuse observatory in the south of the study area ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism 2020 from which it is evident that the water level increased regularly by roughly 10 cm at night which affected the water temperature ec value and water level of the groundwater at ak06 the sampling point ak08 is a well located in the southernmost part of akaiwa city which is almost halfway between asahi river and suna river water temperature fluctuated significantly from 12 c in february to 20 c in september roughly 2 months after the recorded air temperature change fig 8a however the groundwater level did not change throughout the year fig 8b of the four groundwater locations the shallow well with a depth of 3 m saw the largest changes in water temperature table 1b suggesting that the well is susceptible to temperature changes the ec value was roughly 1 ms m higher in winter however sufficient observation data are not available because of equipment failure during this measurement period the sampling point ak14 is a well located along the suna river in the southern part of akaiwa city the maximum depth of this well is 30 m the ctd sensor was located 15 m deeper than the water level table 1b indeed the water level and ec value at ak14 were almost constant problems occurred during the measurement period moreover the water temperature was also constant except around march when it decreased regularly by roughly 0 3 c for sampling in july 2016 when the water level was shallow groundwater was pumped from the well the water temperature was 15 4 c and the ec value was 35 ms m table 2c this ec value is characteristically higher than those of other areas fig 5b in general for ak14 the ctd sensor recorded an ec value of 48 ms m which is higher than the value obtained in july thereby reflecting deeper groundwater 4 4 δd and δ18o of groundwater and river water groundwater δd and δ18o values range from 55 to 26 and 8 5 to 5 8 respectively table 3 the river water values from asahi river and yoshii river range from 55 to 50 for δd and 8 7 to 7 9 for δ18o and lower than groundwaters in contrast δd and δ18o values of suna river are 48 4 and 7 4 higher than those of asahi river and yoshii river table 3e the asahi river and yoshii river flow south from the chugoku mountains to the seto inland sea and suna river originates in the hills of the northern region of the city fig 4 the observed isotope differences between suna river and other two rivers are due to an altitude effect e g dansgaard 1964 waseda and nakai 1983 clark and fritz 1997 rong et al 2012 groundwater samples collected in okayama city during the summer of 2015 table 3a only analyzed for δ18o and 2016 table 3b have similar δ18o values fig 10a shows the relationship δd vs δ18o of the water samples in summer of 2016 in okayama city and akaiwa city shows the composition between two meteoric water lines δd 8δ18o 10 and δd 8δ18o 20 craig 1961 there is no clear difference in δd vs δ18o values between both cities a half of the water samples are higher in δd vs δ18o values than those of river waters and annual weight averaged values of precipitation observed at stations 1 and 2 in this study november 2016 october 2017 table 4 and at station 3 in 2011 2018 by fujiike 2017 broken circle in fig 9a fig 10b shows δd and δ18o values of groundwaters in summer and winter in akaiwa city it is characterized that both δd and δ18o values of groundwaters are higher than those of annual weight averaged values of precipitation and plotted between two meteoric water lines also d excess values of river waters in winter are higher than those in summer figs 10c and d shows the distribution of δd and δ18o values for groundwater sampled in july 2016 respectively the δd and δ18o values of the asahi river and yoshii river range from 55 to 50 and from 8 7 to 7 9 respectively whereas those of the suna river are as high as 49 and 7 4 river water values are shown by triangles in fig 10c and d according to fig 10b and c the δd and δ18o values for some groundwater samples taken along the asahi river are below 53 and 8 7 respectively indicating that river water infiltration took place which is consistent with the results predicted from water temperature and ec values the δd and δ18o values of groundwater in the central part of the study area ranged from 50 to 47 and from 8 0 to 7 2 respectively and many groundwater samples along the suna river and part of the yoshii river showed high isotopic compositions these groundwater samples have higher δd and δ18o values than those from the suna river and yoshii river waters 4 5 δd and δ18o of precipitation in this study the monthly isotopic composition of precipitation was observed at two stations fig 4a from november 2017 to october 2018 table 4 and fig 11 since groundwater is often a mixture of river water and precipitation the δd and δ18o values of precipitation was obtained to discuss the origin of groundwater the δd and δ18o values which range from 104 to 14 and 14 6 to 4 2 respectively have greater variations than groundwater and are plotted between the two meteoric water lines d excess values 10 and 20 fig 11a the δd and δ18o values of precipitation are the lowest in march and the monthly changes in said values are similar at the two stations fig 11b through 11e precipitation began to increase around june peaking in october fig 11e the d excess value was roughly 25 from november to february winter and roughly 10 in other seasons fig 11d ichiyanagi and tanoue 2016 reported that spatial distributions of δd δ18o slope and annual mean d excess of the local meteoric water line in precipitations at 56 sites across japan are 7 6 8 6 and 8 21 respectively similar findings have been reported elsewhere e g petit et al 1991 delmotte et al 2000 peng et al 2004 wassenaar et al 2011 windhorst et al 2013 katsuyama et al 2015 okakita et al 2018 the amount of annual precipitation was 1082 mm at station 1 in okayama city and 1355 mm at station 2 in akaiwa city table 4 which is similar to the annual precipitation from the meteorological data of wake town from 2015 to 2019 934 1484 mm mean 1290 mm japan meteorological agency 2020 from the observed δd and δ18o values and the precipitation amount the annual weighted averages for station 1 and station 2 are 61 and 70 for δd values and 9 3 and 10 5 for δ18o values respectively table 4 fig 11a according to fujiike 2017 the annual weighted average δd and δ18o values of precipitation at the observation point in mitsu town st 3 in fig 4a for 2011 2018 fluctuate dramatically 69 to 51 and 10 0 to 7 6 respectively broken circle in fig 10a and b the weighted mean values observed in this study over 1 year starting from november 2016 are approximal to the lower range of the values reported by fujiike 2017 if groundwater originates from precipitation and has a residence time of 1 year then its δd and δ18o values will be the annual mean of regional precipitation in this study because the δd and δ18o values of groundwater are higher than the annual weighted average of precipitation it is assumed that groundwater has a residence time of 1 year because three rivers were in the study area river water infiltration should be large moreover it is highly likely that the groundwater consists of precipitation and river water the δd and δ18o values of groundwater in three alluvial fans in the toyama prefecture show the composition between the annual weighted average of precipitation and river water it has been reported that with an increase in distance from the river the precipitation contribution increases iwatake et al 2013 okakita et al 2019 in this study area the annual weighted average values of precipitation as well as the δd and δ18o values of river water in summer are lower than those of groundwater moreover in winter those of river water are similar to those of groundwater this suggests that groundwater is a mixture of river water and seasonal precipitation 4 6 chemical composition of the groundwater the chemical composition of the groundwater and river water is shown in table 3 fig 12a and b shows stiff 1951 and piper diagrams piper 1944 of the composition of groundwater in summer and both in summer and winter respectively to investigate the characteristics of groundwater quality in the study area no significant differences can be seen in groundwater composition between winter and summer the groundwater samples mainly consist of ca2 hco3 type water with some exceptions with compositions similar to the river water from the asahi river and yoshii river the concentrations of dissolved components mainly ca2 and hco3 increase with an increase in distance from the rivers groundwater has been reported to react with rocks in the strata where the concentration of dissolved constituents increases during ground infiltration for instance it changes to ca2 hco3 type water in response to limestone e g iwatake et al 2013 in addition an increase in dissolved components can be observed from the northern region to the southern region of the study area therefore it is assumed that the residence time of groundwater in areas far from the asahi river and the yoshii river is longer than the residence time of groundwater in the vicinity of the rivers in the southern region mg2 and so4 2 components increased fig 12a one of the reasons for the increase in mg2 and so4 2 components is the fact that this area is reclaimed land fig 2 moreover it is likely that sulfate and mg salts are fully dissolved in this region the concentration of sio2 in groundwater is one of tools available for determining the residence time of groundwater e g marçais et al 2018 fig 12c shows the concentration of sio2 in groundwater in summer indicating that the concentration of sio2 is 13 3 50 1 mg l higher than that in river water 10 6 19 4 mg l table 3 iwatake et al 2013 reported that sio2 concentration of groundwaters in sho river alluvium fan toyama are 10 2 59 8 mg l and higher than those of river waters 8 9 mg l which are similar to the results in the study area the concentration of sio2 in groundwater along the asahi river is 20 mg l however it increases with an increase in distance from rivers in addition there are areas around the suna river where the sio2 concentration is high fig 12c it is concluded that groundwater residence times are relatively long in areas away from rivers which are in consistent with the results by water temperature and stable isotope compositions of groundwaters 4 7 principal component analysis of water samples principal component analysis pca laaksoharju et al 1999 was conducted to investigate the origin of groundwater and rock water reactions multivariate analysis software gel science pirouette le ver 3 11 was used for the analysis fig 13 shows the calculated results based on all nine items of na k ca2 mg2 cl hco3 so4 2 and sio2 concentrations and δ18o as target components analytical values were used for the groundwater and river water samples the precipitation composition was calculated on the basis of the observed data by fujiike 2017 at station 3 in the component matrix of the factor loadings of the first and second principal components obtained by the pca the factor loadings of k hco3 sio2 and δ18o are positive and those of na ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 are negative indicating the influence of seawater components in polder land formations in the study area precipitation shows the lowest values of 1st and 2nd principal components river water shows slightly higher values and groundwater has even higher values suggesting that leaching of dissolved components especially hco3 and sio2 is progressing due to reaction with rocks fig 13 groundwater at the sampling points ok18 ok02 ok03a and ok03b in the southern part of the study area have larger negative values for the 2nd principal components compared with other samples for these groundwater samples the concentrations of dissolved ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 are high this means that source of the mg2 and so4 2 come from marine origin 4 8 origin of groundwater the groundwater in the study area is characterized by low concentrations of dissolved components which increase with an increase in distance from the asahi river and yoshii river in addition the continuous observations of groundwater temperature and ec values in the four sites suggest that the groundwater temperature changes several months after the air temperature changes in the northern area of akaiwa city the groundwater δd and δ18o values showed a composition along the meteoric water line δd 8δ18o 10 and are higher or the same than those of river water they are considerably higher than the 2017 weighted average values for precipitation on the basis of the data the groundwater is a mixture of river water and precipitation though the infiltration of river water from the asahi river is large in okayama city the sampling points ok05a ok05b ok06 ok07a and ok07b were collected from wells of a water purification plant for water supply and are assumed to be the subsurface water of asahi river at these sites the δd and δ18o values of groundwater are similar but slightly higher to those of river water from the asahi river table 3a therefore the groundwater from the water treatment plant is assumed to consist mainly of river water mixed with water from precipitation this result is consistent with the mixing of precipitation in the groundwater near the sho river alluvial fan in the toyama prefecture iwatake et al 2013 in areas far from these rivers the groundwater δd and δ18o values are higher than those of the weighted average of precipitation even when taking into account past data therefore it is unlikely that precipitation remains for 1 year in addition considering the fact that the groundwater temperature changes several months after the air temperature changes it is estimated that in areas far from rivers precipitation infiltrates underground and gushes out several months later the δd and δ18o values of precipitation fluctuate widely from month to month the months with values higher than the weighted average of precipitation consist of november through to may excluding march fig 11a from the δd and δ18o values considering that the monthly precipitation increases from november to april it is estimated that precipitation entered the groundwater during the period the sampling site ak28 is the only hot spring sampled in this study with a water temperature of 32 c although it was only sampled in winter the hot spring water is characterized by a high hco3 content with very high δd and δ18o values 26 and 5 8 respectively table 3d and fig 10b hot spring water with a δd value of 20 has been reported in japan as geopressured brine however its δ18o value ranges from 0 to 8 and has a salt concentration similar to or higher than that of seawater e g ueda et al 2010 although the ec value of ak28 is 46 3 ms m which is higher than that of groundwater it is unlikely that it consists of geopressured brine since its low dissolved content to date the cause of these unusually high δd and δ18o values is unknown 4 9 examination of scale precipitation when an open type gshp is used groundwater is pumped and heat is exchanged on the ground accordingly caco3 calcite feooh ferrihydrite and fe oh 3 goethite scales may precipitate in the heat exchangers and pipes to examine the possibility of scale precipitation the saturation index s i of scale components was calculated using phreeqc software parkhurst and appelo 1999 the saturation index is shown as follows 1 s i l o g q k where q is the activity product ca2 co3 2 for calcite and k is the equilibrium constant when the s i exceeds 0 the dissolved groundwater components are saturated or supersaturated those dissolved components cannot dissolve in groundwater and deposited as precipitates in heat exchangers and groundwater pipes the results are shown in fig 14 from which it can be predicted that precipitation will not occur for caco3 because it is always unsaturated s i 0 fig 14a feooh is supersaturated in some groundwater fig 14b whereas fe oh 3 is always supersaturated fig 14c that increases with an increase in the ph level this indicates that it is highly likely that fe oh 3 will precipitate when groundwater is used fig 14d shows the concentrations of iron in groundwater which varies across the range of 1 4260 μg l it is assumed that the increase in iron concentration in the groundwater can be attributed to the difference in the redox potential of groundwater indeed an increase in iron concentration can be observed as the groundwater approaches the reduced state fig 14e in groundwater iron exists as fe2 and fe3 ions in the reduced state fe2 becomes the main chemical species and the fe concentration increases because the solubility increases here the relationship between the geology and iron concentration in groundwater is unknown but geological data do exist for ak18 in akaiwa city data from chubu geological laboratory inc here a corroded soil layer can be observed 7 m underground in other areas gravel and silt layers dominate and corrosive soil layers cannot be found suggesting that corrosive soil may have reduced groundwater in light of this information it is evident that iron scale may precipitate when groundwater with a high iron concentration is used for open type gshp one office kawada kogyo co ltd in nanto city toyama prefecture has been using an open type gshp for several years with groundwater with supersaturated iron scale the formation of iron scale has been confirmed in filters which are regularly cleaned kushida et al 2015 therefore although the iron scale precipitates an open type gshp can be used in areas where iron concentration is low 4 10 examination of heat utilization using groundwater in the study area from the δd and δ18o values and chemical composition of groundwater river water and precipitation the appropriate context of an open type gshp can be identified fig 15 for gshp the heat recovery rate increases when the temperature difference between the groundwater and air increases therefore an open type gshp is appropriate for the majority of areas in akaiwa city and in okayama city for areas far from the asahi river indeed significant differences cannot be observed in groundwater quality across the sampling sites although the dissolved components increase as the distance from the river increases the increase in concentration does not significantly effect on the use of open type gshp however in groundwater with high iron concentrations large amounts of iron scale will precipitate in heat exchangers in these circumstances a closed type gshp should be used 5 conclusions in this paper geothermal heat pump utilization was examined for akaiwa city and the northeastern region of okayama city the δd and δ18o values and the chemical composition of 53 groundwater samples and 6 river water samples were analyzed to investigate origin and flow mode for the origin of groundwater the analysis of the δd and δ18o values and chemical composition indicated that the groundwater around the asahi river is dominated by the river water moreover the water around the suna river is dominated by precipitation for the asahi river area the application of a gshp is difficult especially in the southern region because the temperature difference between air and groundwater is small alternatively in akaiwa city the water temperature is essentially constant throughout the year fluctuating several months after the air temperature changes therefore the temperature difference between the air and water is large and accordingly a gshp can be applied efficiently an open type gshp will require periodic cleaning specifically the filters as trace precipitation of iron scale is expected overall the results suggest that in akaiwa city and the northern region of okayama city an open type gshp can be utilized however for groundwater with high iron concentrations a closed type gshp should be used declaration of competing interest the

12012,proper planning for better management of water resources especially groundwater is of particular importance due to water deficits and reductions in aquifer drawdown depth the qazvin plain has been exposed to variations of water levels in the aquifer drawdown during recent years the present study aims to evaluate the dependency among the variations of aquifer drawdown groundwater levels and different effective factors using data mining association rules and the apriori algorithm information on changes in aquifer drawdown depth and the affecting factors 2004 2018 were considered to extract the association rules the results of association rules were evaluated by confidence support and lift indices based on the results increasing the volume of the discharged water from agricultural wells with more than 0 8 million cubic meters had the highest correlation with the aquifer drawdown with more than 1 m in addition the extracted rules demonstrated that the aquifer drawdown was less than 0 3 m when the volume of water delivered to the irrigation network and discharged from agricultural wells was more than 0 5 and less than 0 2 million cubic meters respectively further the air temperature and water demand of plants had a direct relationship with the volume of the aquifer drawdown in most extracted rules while the precipitation volume and percentage of air humidity had reverse relations with the aquifer drawdown finally due to the unfavorable conditions of the qazvin plain further use of irrigation networks and suitable cropping patterns is strongly recommended regarding improving aquifer conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords apriori algorithm aquifer management data mining irrigation areas qazvin plain 1 introduction agricultural development and population growth followed by the increasing need for water resources have created instability in traditional water resource management the main part of the imbalance of water resources results from natural factors while the other part is related to improper human made decisions and activities which affect water resource management leading to different problems in exploiting groundwater resources groundwater is a main resource for fresh water worldwide especially in arid and semi arid regions in general it is clean and accessible for consumers and more than 2 billion people rely on groundwater for supplying drinking water mackay et al 2015 according to konikow and kendy 2005 the deficit in the volume of global groundwater resources is annually computed nearly 750 800 billion cubic meters during the recent years water resources have suffered from poor management due to the free consumption or paying extremely low costs for water leading to water wastage regardless of high costs for constructing dams water reservoirs and water pumping systems hardisty and ozdemiroglu 2004 in addition managers in the field of groundwater resources encounter complex relationships and highly varied characteristics of large volumes of data which are difficult to analyze and manage by empirical and statistical methods more precisely it is virtually impossible in various basins following an increase in data production in various aspects of science the human feels the necessity for powerful instruments and techniques regarding processing these data more than ever although computers have been useful in different activities and have managed the existing data in these systems it is necessary to analyze a large amount of data han et al 2011 the results of mirhashemi et al 2020 demonstrated that the classification and regression tree data mining algorithm can be used in planning and managing the qazvin plain aquifer the findings of the algorithm and association rules can be utilized as the primary step in developing monthly seasonal and annual models for forecasting events including droughts and other meteorological variables such as air humidity evaporation and the like nourani and molajou 2017 data mining refers to the exploration and analysis of a great volume of data for discovering meaningful patterns and rules the data mining process is occasionally called knowledge discovery as well han et al 2011 further the discovery of dependency rules in the database is considered as one of the most important parts of data mining since these rules guarantee the necessity of the occurrence of some attributes items in case of the occurrence of some other items the apriori algorithm is the best known algorithm for extracting the dependency rule barbara et al 2001 considering the importance of data mining in the present study the data mining method was employed to analyze and manage the aquifer condition according to tan et al 2006 data mining is a process which automatically discovers valuable information among the existing data in great databases descriptive explorers of data mining are responsible for recognizing data attributes in databases this type of explorers produces new and valuable information about the existing data kantardzic 2011 furthermore the exploring association rules aim to find the relations between the elements of a system accordingly finding dependencies correlations the existing cause and effect structures among the members the objects of information banks exchanges and transactions and other data stores are involved in this category tan et al 2006 harms and deogun 2004 used data mining for drought management and found the relations between implicit climatic events through exploring consecutive association rules with time lag constraints on a global scale and local drought conditions the analysis of association rules is utilized to identify hidden relations and patterns among several variables although it is employed extremely limitedly in environmental studies tadesse et al 2004 the apriori algorithm which was first proposed and analyzed by agrawal et al in 1993 is one of the famous data mining techniques the association rule learning procedure can be widely applied to both single probe and multi sensor data and improves the quality evaluation of other time series data yu et al 2018 additionally association rules are suitable for studying extreme events and cover highly uncertain phenomena compared to other methods such as regression and correlation analysis in addition these rules can produce measures which uncover the cause effect relationships between several combinations of variables at various spatial and temporal scales changpetch and lin 2013 accordingly yang 2017 reported that the improved apriori algorithm is an effective algorithm for managing water resources monitoring water quality and supervising water quality improvement in another study marjan moazamnia et al 2019 formulated a strategy to combine artificial intelligence models using the bayesian model averaging in order to evaluate a distressed aquifer with sparse data availability sadeghfam et al 2019 studied groundwater remediation through pump treat inject technology using optimum control by artificial intelligence ocai and concluded that the ocai integrated three modules to control contaminants reduce runtime and meet water quality constraints and discharge capacity at the wells which is considered as the novelty of this study further nadiri et al 2019 focused on modelling groundwater level variations by learning from multiple models using a fuzzy logic and found that using committee machines is superior compared to the other two options furthermore simple averaging weighted averaging and committee machine models produce defensible modelling results for developing management scenarios accordingly the present study used the apriori algorithm to determine and extract association rules between the relations of the variations of the aquifer drawdown in the qazvin plain and effective factors 2 case study and data qazvin province with an area of 15821 square kilometers is located between the latitude and longitude of 48 53 min to 36 and 50 min in the northwest corner and 50 35 min to 35 and 18 min in the southeastern corner of central iran additionally the qazvin irrigation network with the area of 57 000 ha is placed in the north west of iran qazvin plain the network inflow is mainly provided through taleghan dam and integrated wells distributed over the network area in addition the irrigation systems of a furrow border and sprinkler are commonly employed across the network ghahroodi et al 2015 the situation of qazvin plain among the plains of iran is shown in fig 1 the collected data in this study included monthly information about qazvin plain during 2004 2018 given that the aquifer drawdown depth of qazvin plain mainly occurs during four months i e june july august and september so that the effect of different factors was analyzed on the variations of the aquifer drawdown during these months in the present study seven effective factors in the variations of the aquifer drawdown in qazvin plain were utilized including three human and four natural factors the data related to the volume of water delivered to the irrigation network the volume of water discharged from agricultural wells and the volume of agricultural water demand were received from a regional water company of qazvin further meteorological data including air temperature humidity percentage wind speed and sunshine hours for calculating potential transpiration evaporation were obtained from qazvin meteorological organization eventually data on horticultural and agricultural water requirements for computing agricultural water demand were received from the qazvin agricultural organization the human factors encompassed the volume of water discharged from agricultural wells million cubic meters the volume of water delivered to the irrigation network million cubic meters and the volume of agricultural water demand million cubic meters furthermore natural factors were selected as the volume of precipitations million cubic meters air temperature c air humidity and potential evapotranspiration eto mm day the details of which are presented in table 1 the transmissivity factor is considered as the rate of flow under a unit hydraulic gradient through a unit width of the aquifer of given saturated thickness and the transmissivity of an aquifer is related to its hydraulic conductivity as follows t kb where t and b denote transmissivity l2 t and aquifer thickness l respectively the transmissivity coefficient of about 73 of the total area of qazvin plain is estimated to be more than 500 square meters per day l2 t additionally the hydraulic conductivity of the qazvin plain is estimated between 0 05 and 15 m per day and the layer thickness of the qazvin aquifer is 20 150 m 3 method to determine the volume of agricultural water demand the surface area was primarily obtained for various farming and gardening crops cultivated in qazvin plain in different years and then the amount of needed monthly water for any crop was multiplied by its cultivated surface area the data from 20 rain gauge stations were used to calculate precipitation volume and data from 1840 agricultural wells located in qazvin plain were applied to calculate the volume of water discharged from agricultural wells further monthly data collected from 163 observation wells were utilized to determine the variations of the aquifer drawdown fig 2 displays the situation of observation wells and rain gauge stations in qazvin plain furthermore the diagram of the variations of the aquifer drawdown during 15 years is shown in fig 3 3 1 the association rules finding association rules was one of the aims of the present study agrawal et al 1993 introduced association data mining and the extraction of association rules from a dataset made of possible rules the association rules indicate mutual relations and dependencies among a large group of data items thus finding such rules may be noticeable and be employed in different fields agrawal et al 1993 3 2 the apriori model this apriori model was first presented by agrawal in 1993 the model may be called as the prediction algorithm and is assumed as one of the most important findings for extracting dependency rules zhao and bhowmick 2003 additionally the apriori algorithm suggests five different techniques to select the rules and uses a high level and complex indexing program to efficiently process the great dataset in addition it generally acts faster than generalized rule induction for solving the biggest problems since there is no arbitrary limitation of the number of the remaining rules and it can produce the rules despite more than 32 primary conditions all input and output data should be necessarily classified in this algorithm since it is optimized for this type of data cheung et al 1996 3 3 introducing three basic terms related to association rules confidence it determines the accuracy of a rule on the other hand it is the ratio of the number of events including a and b to the number of events including a this term is a conditional probability for a to include b as well this term was first introduced by agrawal et al 1993 support it is the probability of antecedent and consequent inclusion in a rule in other words it indicates the ratio of the simultaneous events of a and b to the total existing events in the set which is obtained by dividing the number of events including a and b into the total number of events more precisely this term denotes the probability of the simultaneous presence of a and b in rule a b this term was presented by agrawal et al 1993 as well lift it is a criterion for evaluating the correlation value between two datasets so that the two sets are negatively correlated if the lift value is smaller than one otherwise both sets are positively correlated further the two sets are independent with no correlation if the value is equal to one it should be noted that this term which was introduced by brin et al 1997 is used to test the goodness of the rule the three above mentioned terms are utilized to evaluate the produced rules in the above mentioned relations n denotes the number of qualified records and n expresses the total number of the records the apriori algorithm which is one of the developed algorithms for discovering association rules or dependency was employed in the present study furthermore the datasets of human factors were selected including the volume of water discharged from agricultural wells million cubic meters the volume of water delivered to the irrigation network million cubic meters the volume of irrigation water requirement million cubic meters and natural factors such as precipitations million cubic meters air temperature c air humidity and eto mm day as the antecedent set additionally the data related to the variations of the aquifer drawdown m were introduced as the consequent data to the model the goal was to extract the association rules between the two previous sets the effective factors in the fluctuations of the depth of the aquifer and consequent values the variations of the aquifer drawdown using the apriori algorithm given that the necessary data should be separated from the analysis of association rules resulting from the apriori algorithm all of the applied data were converted to classify forms the results of each value of effective factors in the variations of the aquifer drawdown were categorized into low middle and large groups within four months i e june july august and september for easier analysis in addition the borders of data classification were selected so that any class could have sufficient numbers of data considering the data in table 1 the values of the mean and standard deviation for the variations of the aquifer drawdown and their effective factors do not highly differ during the four studied months thus all data related to these months were classified into low middle and large ranges table 2 and 3 4 results the apriori algorithm was used to generate association rules between the dependence of the depth changes of the aquifer drawdown and its influencing factors the numbering of the rules in tables 4 7 is such that the confidence percentage value is ordered as high to low therefore the first rule has the highest percentage of confidence while the last one has the lowest percentage the first rule of table 4 is described as an example for a better understanding of the extracted rules by the apriori algorithm tables 4 7 as shown the highest confidence level belongs to rule 1 and is equal to 98 based on the first rule the aquifer drawdown could vary from 0 3 to 1 m in 98 of cases where the water volume of the network and the volume of agricultural water demand were low the air humidity was at the middle level and the eto and air temperature were large the results further demonstrate that support coefficient for this rule is 10 5 namely the sum of antecedent values occurs simultaneously with the consequent value in rule 1 in 10 5 of the total effective factors in the variations of the aquifer drawdown the value of the lift term which represents the effectiveness of this rule in finding results compared to random choices is greater than one indicating the positive correlation between the two sets i e antecedent and consequent values along with the favorable effect of this rule 4 1 the extraction of association rules in june based on the data in table 4 among the human factors the volume of water discharged from agricultural wells has a direct relationship with the volume of the aquifer drawdown regarding the natural factors air temperature is directly related to the volume of the aquifer drawdown in most cases however the volume of the aquifer drawdown decreases only in the seventh rule due to the increment in air temperature which is probably related to the low volume of water discharged from agricultural wells the results indicate that the volume of precipitation is inversely related to the volume of changes in the aquifer drawdown rules 2 4 and 9 in rules 2 and 7 where the volume of the delivered water was high and the volume of water discharged from agricultural wells was low the changes in the depth of the aquifer drawdown were low these two rules are relatively strong due to the high value of relevant evaluation indices as presented in table 5 aquifer drawdown changes are more remarkable in june in most rules the air humidity percentage and precipitation values are low indicating an inverse relationship between these two factors and the volume of the aquifer drawdown the eighth rule is the only rule which represents a low aquifer drawdown which is probably due to the high precipitation volume and low air temperature further the amount of the depth of the aquifer drawdown has increased in rules where the volume of agricultural water demand by plants is high furthermore no significant drawdown is observed in aquifer depth in rules 3 to 6 where the water demand by plants is low indicating the importance of crop cultivation based on the appropriate cropping pattern under critical aquifer conditions these four rules have a highly better lift and support percentage compared to the others which makes them strong in the table table 6 highlights the direct and indirect relationship between the volumes of discharged from agricultural wells and the amount of the aquifer drawdown changes the amount of aquifer drawdown depth decreased or increased as the amount of water discharged from agricultural wells demonstrated a decrease or increase respectively on the other hand the amount of the depth of the aquifer drawdown increased by increasing air temperature decreasing air humidity percentage and decreasing precipitation volume in rule 5 although the volume of precipitation represented an increase the aquifer drawdown level increased with 80 confidence 10 support and 2 5 lift due to the high volume of water discharged from agricultural wells and high air temperature based on the obtained data table 6 the volume of changes in the aquifer drawdown reduced at the time when the volume of water delivered to the irrigation network was high while the volume of water discharged from agricultural wells was low additionally the amount of precipitation and the percentage of air humidity increased compared to other months whereas the air temperature demonstrated a decrease table 7 in rules 2 and 5 tables 4 and 6 the volume of changes in the aquifer drawdown reduced when the volume of water delivered to the irrigation network was high while the volume of water discharged from the agricultural wells was low thus these two rules are valid given the relatively high values of their evaluation indices which highlights the need for greater use of irrigation networks regarding reducing the aquifer drawdown based on the data in fig 4 the highest confidence was obtained from rule 1 in august 1 regarding the diagrams no large difference is found in terms of the confidence percentage of four months since their confidence decreased by increasing the number of rules allowing the diagrams to become descending the results further indicated that the lowest confidence 0 70 belongs to rule 9 in august as illustrated in fig 5 the highest support value 0 14 in the third rule occurs in august no high difference is observed among support percentage values in other cases except for the support percentage of the third rule in june which relatively differs from the rest on the other hand the lowest values 0 09 of the support are related to rule 5 in september and rule 6 in august as shown in fig 6 the highest lift value 4 5 of the two sets i e antecedent and consequent values belongs to rule 4 in june unlike the diagrams of figs 4 and 5 those of fig 6 include more dispersions however the lowest lift value 1 is related to rule 9 in september representing the independence of the relationship between the two antecedent and consequent sets figs 7 9 illustrate the number of simultaneous occurrences between changes in the aquifer drawdown and various contributing factors during the four studied months over 15 years 2004 2018 as depicted the vertical axis of the diagram in fig 7 denotes the number of the simultaneous occurrences of variations in the aquifer drawdown within the range of low aquifer drawdown the variations of the aquifer drawdown 0 0 3 m furthermore the vertical axis of the diagram in fig 8 displays the number of the simultaneous occurrences of variations in the aquifer drawdown within the range of middle aquifer drawdown the aquifer drawdown 0 3 1 m additionally the vertical axis of the diagram in fig 9 demonstrates the number of the simultaneous occurrences of variations in the aquifer drawdown within the range of large aquifer drawdown the aquifer drawdown 1 m accordingly with respect to figs 7 9 the largest number of the simultaneous occurrences of variations in the aquifer drawdown is 3133 4180 and 1778 in all three categories of low middle and large respectively demonstrating that the number of middle aquifer drawdown the aquifer drawdown 0 3 1 m had the largest number of occurrence modes among the three ranges of the aquifer drawdown contrarily the lowest number of the simultaneous occurrences of variations in the aquifer drawdown is 157 188 and 103 implying that the number of large aquifer drawdown the aquifer drawdown 1 m had the least number of occurrence modes among the three ranges of the aquifer drawdown respectively figs 7 9 depict the range of the variations in the horizontal axes for seven effective factors in the variations of the aquifer drawdown within low middle and large categories table 2 as shown the higher value of the bar diagram of the effective factor leads to the greater relationship of simultaneous occurrence between the number of the modes of the variations in the aquifer drawdown and the related effective factor among the effective factors in the variations of the aquifer drawdown the volume of water discharged from agricultural wells has the largest effect so that the largest number of the variations of the aquifer drawdown 2796 belongs to the relationship between the amount of large agricultural wells greater than 0 8 million cubic meters and the number of middle aquifer drawdown the aquifer drawdown 0 3 1 m conversely the lowest relationship between the number of the variations in the aquifer drawdown and the related effective factor is relevant to the relationship between medium eto eto 4 6 mm day and the number of large aquifer drawdown the aquifer drawdown 1 m which is 103 5 discussion based on the results most changes in the aquifer drawdown are related to the volume of water discharged from agricultural wells most likely agricultural wells are used for the traditional irrigation system and cause high aquifer drawdowns due to the high water consumption and low efficiency in traditional irrigation in addition the large number of agricultural wells in qazvin plain can have different negative effects on the aquifer drawdown status on the other hand most changes associated with low aquifer drawdown changes are due to the large volume of water delivered to the irrigation network considering that the high volume of water delivered to the irrigation network is provided through taleghan dam the greater use of irrigation networks can help reduce the use of agricultural wells in qazvin plain therefore applying irrigation networks can reduce the negative impacts of the unsuitable use of agricultural wells on changes in the aquifer drawdown in addition to better management of applied water in agriculture and better water conservation therefore it is recommended that using irrigation networks help better manage water resources further the volume of agricultural water demand by plants is considered as one of the factors which is directly related to the aquifer drawdown emphasizing paying attention to the proper cultivation pattern the tree algorithm and association rules are considered as data mining algorithms the examination of each extracted rule by evaluation criteria is regarded as one of the advantages of the apriori algorithm over the tree algorithm on the other hand failure to implement the apriori algorithm with continuous data is one of the disadvantages of the apriori algorithm and the applied data need a categorization 6 conclusion in general the results revealed that increasing the volume of water discharged from agricultural wells with more than 0 8 million cubic meters has the highest correlation with the aquifer drawdown with more than 1 m based on the results the air temperature and water demand of plants had a direct relationship with the volume of the aquifer drawdown in most of the extracted rules on the other hand the precipitation volume and percentage of air humidity had a reverse relationship with the aquifer drawdown based on the results of the present study a fundamental and appropriate approach to the water discharge from agricultural wells should be adopted due to the negative effects of excessive water discharge from agricultural wells on aquifer drawdown changes furthermore using a suitable cultivation pattern with less water consumption is recommended due to the critical condition of the aquifer in the qazvin plain eventually the apriori algorithm can extract association rules among the variations of the aquifer drawdown and different human and natural effective factors

coefficient of about 73 of the total area of qazvin plain is estimated to be more than 500 square meters per day l2 t additionally the hydraulic conductivity of the qazvin plain is estimated between 0 05 and 15 m per day and the layer thickness of the qazvin aquifer is 20 150 m 3 method to determine the volume of agricultural water demand the surface area was primarily obtained for various farming and gardening crops cultivated in qazvin plain in different years and then the amount of needed monthly water for any crop was multiplied by its cultivated surface area the data from 20 rain gauge stations were used to calculate precipitation volume and data from 1840 agricultural wells located in qazvin plain were applied to calculate the volume of water discharged from agricultural wells further monthly data collected from 163 observation wells were utilized to determine the variations of the aquifer drawdown fig 2 displays the situation of observation wells and rain gauge stations in qazvin plain furthermore the diagram of the variations of the aquifer drawdown during 15 years is shown in fig 3 3 1 the association rules finding association rules was one of the aims of the present study agrawal et al 1993 introduced association data mining and the extraction of association rules from a dataset made of possible rules the association rules indicate mutual relations and dependencies among a large group of data items thus finding such rules may be noticeable and be employed in different fields agrawal et al 1993 3 2 the apriori model this apriori model was first presented by agrawal in 1993 the model may be called as the prediction algorithm and is assumed as one of the most important findings for extracting dependency rules zhao and bhowmick 2003 additionally the apriori algorithm suggests five different techniques to select the rules and uses a high level and complex indexing program to efficiently process the great dataset in addition it generally acts faster than generalized rule induction for solving the biggest problems since there is no arbitrary limitation of the number of the remaining rules and it can produce the rules despite more than 32 primary conditions all input and output data should be necessarily classified in this algorithm since it is optimized for this type of data cheung et al 1996 3 3 introducing three basic terms related to association rules confidence it determines the accuracy of a rule on the other hand it is the ratio of the number of events including a and b to the number of events including a this term is a conditional probability for a to include b as well this term was first introduced by agrawal et al 1993 support it is the probability of antecedent and consequent inclusion in a rule in other words it indicates the ratio of the simultaneous events of a and b to the total existing events in the set which is obtained by dividing the number of events including a and b into the total number of events more precisely this term denotes the probability of the simultaneous presence of a and b in rule a b this term was presented by agrawal et al 1993 as well lift it is a criterion for evaluating the correlation value between two datasets so that the two sets are negatively correlated if the lift value is smaller than one otherwise both sets are positively correlated further the two sets are independent with no correlation if the value is equal to one it should be noted that this term which was introduced by brin et al 1997 is used to test the goodness of the rule the three above mentioned terms are utilized to evaluate the produced rules in the above mentioned relations n denotes the number of qualified records and n expresses the total number of the records the apriori algorithm which is one of the developed algorithms for discovering association rules or dependency was employed in the present study furthermore the datasets of human factors were selected including the volume of water discharged from agricultural wells million cubic meters the volume of water delivered to the irrigation network million cubic meters the volume of irrigation water requirement million cubic meters and natural factors such as precipitations million cubic meters air temperature c air humidity and eto mm day as the antecedent set additionally the data related to the variations of the aquifer drawdown m were introduced as the consequent data to the model the goal was to extract the association rules between the two previous sets the effective factors in the fluctuations of the depth of the aquifer and consequent values the variations of the aquifer drawdown using the apriori algorithm given that the necessary data should be separated from the analysis of association rules resulting from the apriori algorithm all of the applied data were converted to classify forms the results of each value of effective factors in the variations of the aquifer drawdown were categorized into low middle and large groups within four months i e june july august and september for easier analysis in addition the borders of data classification were selected so that any class could have sufficient numbers of data considering the data in table 1 the values of the mean and standard deviation for the variations of the aquifer drawdown and their effective factors do not highly differ during the four studied months thus all data related to these months were classified into low middle and large ranges table 2 and 3 4 results the apriori algorithm was used to generate association rules between the dependence of the depth changes of the aquifer drawdown and its influencing factors the numbering of the rules in tables 4 7 is such that the confidence percentage value is ordered as high to low therefore the first rule has the highest percentage of confidence while the last one has the lowest percentage the first rule of table 4 is described as an example for a better understanding of the extracted rules by the apriori algorithm tables 4 7 as shown the highest confidence level belongs to rule 1 and is equal to 98 based on the first rule the aquifer drawdown could vary from 0 3 to 1 m in 98 of cases where the water volume of the network and the volume of agricultural water demand were low the air humidity was at the middle level and the eto and air temperature were large the results further demonstrate that support coefficient for this rule is 10 5 namely the sum of antecedent values occurs simultaneously with the consequent value in rule 1 in 10 5 of the total effective factors in the variations of the aquifer drawdown the value of the lift term which represents the effectiveness of this rule in finding results compared to random choices is greater than one indicating the positive correlation between the two sets i e antecedent and consequent values along with the favorable effect of this rule 4 1 the extraction of association rules in june based on the data in table 4 among the human factors the volume of water discharged from agricultural wells has a direct relationship with the volume of the aquifer drawdown regarding the natural factors air temperature is directly related to the volume of the aquifer drawdown in most cases however the volume of the aquifer drawdown decreases only in the seventh rule due to the increment in air temperature which is probably related to the low volume of water discharged from agricultural wells the results indicate that the volume of precipitation is inversely related to the volume of changes in the aquifer drawdown rules 2 4 and 9 in rules 2 and 7 where the volume of the delivered water was high and the volume of water discharged from agricultural wells was low the changes in the depth of the aquifer drawdown were low these two rules are relatively strong due to the high value of relevant evaluation indices as presented in table 5 aquifer drawdown changes are more remarkable in june in most rules the air humidity percentage and precipitation values are low indicating an inverse relationship between these two factors and the volume of the aquifer drawdown the eighth rule is the only rule which represents a low aquifer drawdown which is probably due to the high precipitation volume and low air temperature further the amount of the depth of the aquifer drawdown has increased in rules where the volume of agricultural water demand by plants is high furthermore no significant drawdown is observed in aquifer depth in rules 3 to 6 where the water demand by plants is low indicating the importance of crop cultivation based on the appropriate cropping pattern under critical aquifer conditions these four rules have a highly better lift and support percentage compared to the others which makes them strong in the table table 6 highlights the direct and indirect relationship between the volumes of discharged from agricultural wells and the amount of the aquifer drawdown changes the amount of aquifer drawdown depth decreased or increased as the amount of water discharged from agricultural wells demonstrated a decrease or increase respectively on the other hand the amount of the depth of the aquifer drawdown increased by increasing air temperature decreasing air humidity percentage and decreasing precipitation volume in rule 5 although the volume of precipitation represented an increase the aquifer drawdown level increased with 80 confidence 10 support and 2 5 lift due to the high volume of water discharged from agricultural wells and high air temperature based on the obtained data table 6 the volume of changes in the aquifer drawdown reduced at the time when the volume of water delivered to the irrigation network was high while the volume of water discharged from agricultural wells was low additionally the amount of precipitation and the percentage of air humidity increased compared to other months whereas the air temperature demonstrated a decrease table 7 in rules 2 and 5 tables 4 and 6 the volume of changes in the aquifer drawdown reduced when the volume of water delivered to the irrigation network was high while the volume of water discharged from the agricultural wells was low thus these two rules are valid given the relatively high values of their evaluation indices which highlights the need for greater use of irrigation networks regarding reducing the aquifer drawdown based on the data in fig 4 the highest confidence was obtained from rule 1 in august 1 regarding the diagrams no large difference is found in terms of the confidence percentage of four months since their confidence decreased by increasing the number of rules allowing the diagrams to become descending the results further indicated that the lowest confidence 0 70 belongs to rule 9 in august as illustrated in fig 5 the highest support value 0 14 in the third rule occurs in august no high difference is observed among support percentage values in other cases except for the support percentage of the third rule in june which relatively differs from the rest on the other hand the lowest values 0 09 of the support are related to rule 5 in september and rule 6 in august as shown in fig 6 the highest lift value 4 5 of the two sets i e antecedent and consequent values belongs to rule 4 in june unlike the diagrams of figs 4 and 5 those of fig 6 include more dispersions however the lowest lift value 1 is related to rule 9 in september representing the independence of the relationship between the two antecedent and consequent sets figs 7 9 illustrate the number of simultaneous occurrences between changes in the aquifer drawdown and various contributing factors during the four studied months over 15 years 2004 2018 as depicted the vertical axis of the diagram in fig 7 denotes the number of the simultaneous occurrences of variations in the aquifer drawdown within the range of low aquifer drawdown the variations of the aquifer drawdown 0 0 3 m furthermore the vertical axis of the diagram in fig 8 displays the number of the simultaneous occurrences of variations in the aquifer drawdown within the range of middle aquifer drawdown the aquifer drawdown 0 3 1 m additionally the vertical axis of the diagram in fig 9 demonstrates the number of the simultaneous occurrences of variations in the aquifer drawdown within the range of large aquifer drawdown the aquifer drawdown 1 m accordingly with respect to figs 7 9 the largest number of the simultaneous occurrences of variations in the aquifer drawdown is 3133 4180 and 1778 in all three categories of low middle and large respectively demonstrating that the number of middle aquifer drawdown the aquifer drawdown 0 3 1 m had the largest number of occurrence modes among the three ranges of the aquifer drawdown contrarily the lowest number of the simultaneous occurrences of variations in the aquifer drawdown is 157 188 and 103 implying that the number of large aquifer drawdown the aquifer drawdown 1 m had the least number of occurrence modes among the three ranges of the aquifer drawdown respectively figs 7 9 depict the range of the variations in the horizontal axes for seven effective factors in the variations of the aquifer drawdown within low middle and large categories table 2 as shown the higher value of the bar diagram of the effective factor leads to the greater relationship of simultaneous occurrence between the number of the modes of the variations in the aquifer drawdown and the related effective factor among the effective factors in the variations of the aquifer drawdown the volume of water discharged from agricultural wells has the largest effect so that the largest number of the variations of the aquifer drawdown 2796 belongs to the relationship between the amount of large agricultural wells greater than 0 8 million cubic meters and the number of middle aquifer drawdown the aquifer drawdown 0 3 1 m conversely the lowest relationship between the number of the variations in the aquifer drawdown and the related effective factor is relevant to the relationship between medium eto eto 4 6 mm day and the number of large aquifer drawdown the aquifer drawdown 1 m which is 103 5 discussion based on the results most changes in the aquifer drawdown are related to the volume of water discharged from agricultural wells most likely agricultural wells are used for the traditional irrigation system and cause high aquifer drawdowns due to the high water consumption and low efficiency in traditional irrigation in addition the large number of agricultural wells in qazvin plain can have different negative effects on the aquifer drawdown status on the other hand most changes associated with low aquifer drawdown changes are due to the large volume of water delivered to the irrigation network considering that the high volume of water delivered to the irrigation network is provided through taleghan dam the greater use of irrigation networks can help reduce the use of agricultural wells in qazvin plain therefore applying irrigation networks can reduce the negative impacts of the unsuitable use of agricultural wells on changes in the aquifer drawdown in addition to better management of applied water in agriculture and better water conservation therefore it is recommended that using irrigation networks help better manage water resources further the volume of agricultural water demand by plants is considered as one of the factors which is directly related to the aquifer drawdown emphasizing paying attention to the proper cultivation pattern the tree algorithm and association rules are considered as data mining algorithms the examination of each extracted rule by evaluation criteria is regarded as one of the advantages of the apriori algorithm over the tree algorithm on the other hand failure to implement the apriori algorithm with continuous data is one of the disadvantages of the apriori algorithm and the applied data need a categorization 6 conclusion in general the results revealed that increasing the volume of water discharged from agricultural wells with more than 0 8 million cubic meters has the highest correlation with the aquifer drawdown with more than 1 m based on the results the air temperature and water demand of plants had a direct relationship with the volume of the aquifer drawdown in most of the extracted rules on the other hand the precipitation volume and percentage of air humidity had a reverse relationship with the aquifer drawdown based on the results of the present study a fundamental and appropriate approach to the water discharge from agricultural wells should be adopted due to the negative effects of excessive water discharge from agricultural wells on aquifer drawdown changes furthermore using a suitable cultivation pattern with less water consumption is recommended due to the critical condition of the aquifer in the qazvin plain eventually the apriori algorithm can extract association rules among the variations of the aquifer drawdown and different human and natural effective factors

12013,application of groundwater for domestic and agricultural uses has increased in sub sahara africa however geology and anthropogenic activities can impact groundwater quality but information on quality evaluation and suitability classification of groundwater based on water quality index wqi is limited thus this study evaluated the spatial variability of groundwater quality and its suitability for potable and irrigation purposes in a precambrian complex of southwest nigeria water samples were collected from 40 wells across the study area and analyzed for physicochemical properties suitability for domestic and irrigation uses were determined maps showing spatial variations of ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solid tds total hardness th cations ca2 mg2 na and k anions so4 2 cl no3 n po3 p b f and hco3 and irrigation water quality index iwqi and drinking water quality index dwqi were produced using arcgis the average values of ph ec tds and th were 6 6 0 3 ds m 1 152 4 mg l 1 and 208 7 mg l 1 respectively the concentrations of ca2 mg2 k and na were 28 7 32 8 2 49 and 7 13 mg l 1 respectively whereas so4 2 cl no3 n po3 p b f and hco3 concentrations were 20 4 0 32 0 46 0 04 0 39 0 42 and 230 7 mg l 1 respectively the quality indices for irrigation iwqi and drinking dwqi were 0 22 and 0 75 respectively the iwqi significantly correlated with mg2 th so4 2 ph and tds p 0 05 r 0 34 0 66 whilst dwqi significantly correlated with tds so4 2 cl no3 n po3 p ca2 mg2 ph th and f p 0 05 r 0 38 0 93 the suitability classification of the groundwater quality in the area shows that 100 and 78 of the water are safe for irrigation and domestic purposes respectively however regular quality monitoring of the groundwater is recommended in order to avert likely deterioration indicated by some quality parameters graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater water quality index irrigation water drinking water kriging 1 introduction in many urban and sub urban centers in africa and asia groundwater has become the main source of water supply for both domestic and agricultural purposes lapworth et al 2017 kawo and karuppannan 2018 and this may be due to reduction in availability and quality of surface water resources beyene et al 2019 globally groundwater provides potable water for about 1 5 billion people dfid 2001 and accounts for about 43 of total irrigation water use siebert et al 2010 groundwater is considered more suitable for irrigation when compared to surface water siebert et al 2010 however the quality of groundwater is influenced by both natural and anthropogenic activities moyo 2013 nair et al 2015 li et al 2017 wu et al 2017 adabanija et al 2020 when water flows through the rocks and sediments it picks naturally occurring pollutants such as dissolved metals and salts moyo 2013 urbanization and industrialization due to complexity in lifestyle as well as agricultural intensification due to population increase have also caused serious degradation to groundwater quality lucas et al 2005 nyakatawa et al 2006 carpenter 2008 kazi et al 2009 abegunrin and sangodoyin 2016 li 2016 li et al 2017 for example nyakatawa et al 2006 reported that excess fertilizer applied to agricultural fields will either be exported to surface waterbodies or infiltrate into the soil and later join groundwater previous groundwater quality research reports varying degrees of quality status by evaluating each of the physical chemical and biological data in assessing water quality discreetly adabanija et al 2015 2020 rahman et al 2017 bhunia et al 2018 kawo and karuppannan 2018 beyene et al 2019 gharbi et al 2019 yusuf and abiye 2019 most of the assessments are cumbersome and sometimes the conclusions could not be easily understood for example in suitability evaluation of groundwater quality for drinking and irrigation purposes in ethiopia by beyene et al 2019 the comparison of individual measured parameters was only made with the world health organization who standards and plotted wilcox 1955 and united state salinity laboratory diagrams this method could be misleading because a water may be found suitable in terms of one parameter and not in terms of another parameter meanwhile they beyene et al 2019 concluded that 68 8 of the water is good for irrigation but high concentration of f and na make the water unsuitable for drinking and irrigation purpose however a recent approach that bridge this gap is the application of an overall water quality index wqi the wqi is a tool developed to summarize the complex multiple water quality parameters into a single score abegunrin et al 2016a the score is ranked into classes such as excellent good or unsuitable to express suitability of the water for specific purposes howladar et al 2017 baba et al 2020 various mathematical and statistical methods have been employed to derive wqi this often involves parameter selection transformation weighing and aggregation srebotnjak et al 2012 rahman and bodrud doza 2018 the wqi has been demonstrated as a formidable tool for interpretation monitoring predicting and comparing the overall water quality status in a consistent manner abegunrin et al 2016a kawo and karuppannan 2018 sankar et al 2018 harbi et al 2019 however the water quality evaluation in ogbomoso a metropolitan in southwestern nigeria has been a subject of many studies but such studies have been based on individual parameters with limited study on the overall wqi adabanija et al 2015 abegunrin et al 2016a adabanija et al 2020 in the same vein previous studies rarely include spatial variability of groundwater quality in the assessment of groundwater in this region kumar 2006 stated that a complete assessment and sustainable management of groundwater require reliable information on its variability with spatial data this often requires the ability to georeferenced and analyzed data using spatial statistical methods as elucidated by geographic information system gis software it is evident from many studies that spatial techniques are useful for comprehensive evaluation and characterization of groundwater quality and to check its degradation for sustainable management kawo and karuppannan 2018 gharbi et al 2019 baba et al 2020 the technique could also guide in delineation of a region to specific management zones rather than handling individual well in this context the objectives of the study were to evaluate the spatial variability of groundwater quality and its suitability for irrigation and domestic uses in a precambrian complex of ogbomoso in southwest nigeria and to produce spatial variation maps of physicochemical properties of groundwater irrigation water quality index iwqi and drinking water quality index dwqi 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area the study was conducted in ogbomoso 8 00 n 8 15 n 4 10 e 4 20 e southwest nigeria the area is characterized with mean annual rainfall of 1200 mm a mean annual maximum and minimum temperatures of 33 and 28 c respectively abegunrin et al 2016b the prevailing climatic condition is tropical with alternating wet season lasting from april to october and the dry season from november to march the location is concealed within the southwestern nigeria precambrian basement complex known for its low porosity 1 and negligible permeability in its unaltered form afolabi et al 2013 oladunjoye et al 2015 thus the occurrence of groundwater in the study area is localized and concentrated within the weathered layer and the fractured underlying rock unit oladunjoye et al 2015 gneisses are the dominant rock type with migmatite gneiss dominating the northern and the southwestern parts while the remaining part was dominated by quartzite the area has high amphibolite facies minerals plagioclase potash feldspar quartz biotite and muscovite the terrain is suspected to be faulted at the southern and northeastern part of the town predominantly groundwater in ogbomoso flows southward and westward adabanija et al 2015 2 2 groundwater sampling the groundwater samples were collected in july 2018 from forty 40 wells spread across the study area fig 1 the 40 wells were randomly selected from lot of available wells across the study area the samples were collected two replicates in 200 ml sampling bottles that have been previously washed with nitric acid 1 1 hno3 h2o solution and thereafter rinsed with distilled water to disinfect the bottles at each site samples were collected after about 10 12 min pumping the collected samples were filtered using 0 45 μm whatman filter paper grade 2 the filtrates were divided into two one part for cations analyses and the other for anions the samples for cations analyses were acidified with 2 ml hno3 to a ph 2 after collection all sample bottles were sealed marked and placed in ice pack container and thereafter transferred to the laboratory for further analyses in the laboratory the samples were kept in the refrigerator at 4 c and all analyses were done within 48 h a global positioning system gps garmin etrex 10 was employed in determining the geographical positions of the sampled wells

calcium magnesium carbonate and bicarbonate concentration respectively the concentration of ions is expressed in meq l 1 for sar kr pi and mar others are in mg l 1 2 5 water quality index wqi the combined impact of the water quality parameters on irrigation was assessed by the wqi the formula is described in eq 6 baba et al 2020 four parameters with assigned weight 1 5 based on their importance for water quality assessment were used in calculating the wqi sundararajan and sabarathinam 2014 howladar et al 2017 baba et al 2020 a weighting factor of 3 5 3 2 and 1 5 was assigned for ec sar hco3 and mg ca ratio respectively 7a wqi 1 n i 1 n ω i q i s i qi is the measured water quality parameter at sampling location i si is the maximum permissible limit of that water quality parameter ωi is the weighing factor and n represents the sum of the number of quality parameters multiplied by their weight the classification of the suitability of water based on wqi is presented in table 1 the nearer the wqi value gets closer to 1 the nearer the water ions value to the benchmark value baba et al 2020 2 6 data analysis 2 6 1 descriptive statistics the dataset were subjected to descriptive statistics to determine the maximum minimum mean standard deviation skewness and kurtosis the coefficient of variation was calculated from the mean and standard deviation pearson correlation analysis was performed between the groundwater quality indices and physico chemical variables the statistics were performed in spss ibm version 20 2 6 2 geospatial analysis the sampling

prepared the thematic maps of groundwater quality parameters the steps include data transformation semivariogram modelling interpolation and cross validation log transformation was applied to the dataset to normalize the data distribution and suppress outliers varouchakis et al 2012 the spatial dependence of the data was assessed with a semivariogram the spatial structure of the semivariogram

groundwater is summarized in table 2 the total dissolved solid tds and electrical conductivity ec of the studied water showed high variability 0 77 and 0 80 respectively an indication of the presence of a varying degree of dissolved salts the ph varied from 5 85 to 6 96 with a mean value of 6 64 the skewness value of 1 49 indicated that the ph of most of the water samples is lower than the mean

a maximum concentration of 4 80 mg l 1 low levels of sodium concentration in the studied water is desirable and common to groundwater potassium has a minimum concentration of 5 50 mg l 1 with low variability sulfate and chloride concentration have the maximum values of 37 50 and 0 80 mg l 1 respectively and moderately varied in the area phosphate phosphorus po4 p and nitrate nitrogen no3 n are essential plant nutrients but are found in low concentration in the studied water maximum value of 0 06 and 0 8 mg l 1 respectively boron concentration in the groundwater has a maximum value of 0 62

all the sampled wells having sar far from the fao benchmark value of 10 meq l 1 the magnesium calcium ratio varied from 1 25 to 2 42 mg l 1 with 90 of the groundwater samples good for irrigation whereas only 10 were excellent the kelly ratio kr an indicator of excess sodium in irrigation water has a maximum value of 0 06 meq l 1 similarly the proportion of sodium with that of total cations soluble sodium percentage ssp has a maximum value of 5 25 mg l 1 compared to the maximum permissible limit of 50 mg l 1 the classification also revealed all the sampling wells are safe for irrigation the interactions between ca2 mg 2 na hco3 and co3 2 in the studied water as reflected by residual sodium carbonates rsc the rsc varied widely nevertheless over 90 of the sampled wells are suitable for irrigation while about 5 and 3 are doubtful or not suitable respectively the permeability index pi indicates that the samples are well dispersed around the mean the classification showed that all the sampled groundwater were good for irrigation the oveerall irrigation water quality index iwqi had values less than one 1 in all case indicating their suitability for irrigation purposes similarly the overall drinking water quality index dwqi ranged between 0 10 and 0 34 mean 0 21 table 3 3 2 correlation analysis as typical of natural waters ec and tds had the highest correlation matrices 0 99 both parameters correlate strongly with hco3 however hco3 only correlated significantly with ec and tds and moderately with na and k which only have a strong correlation with each other table 4 this suggests that hco3 greatly influence the salt concentration of the studied water and hco3 na and k have a similar source all other ions showed strong positive correlation with one another apart from ec that was considered for its computation it is interesting to note that the iwqi showed significant correlation with the water quality variables mg2 th p 0 01 r 0 66 and 0 47 and so4 2 ph tds p 0 05

kriging process table 6 3 4 geospatial maps of the water quality parameters and indices the parameters highly consider for water quality ec and tds fig 3 a and b have a similar but wide spatial variation across the mapped water this is in congruence with their cv 0 8 and 0 77 respectively the spatial variation decreases transversely from the center and increase southwardly in the south central region there exist a spot having both tds and ec in the doubtful range tds 450 mg l 1 and ec 0 75 ds m the spatial variation of ph fig 3c in the studied water is dominantly slight to moderate acidic the southeast edge of the mapped area could have ph value less than desirable ph for irrigation water 6 5 to 8 5 the spatial map of magnesium fig 4 a seems proximate the sampling points have values closer to the neighboring points most of the mapped area has moderate concentration the highest concentration was found on a small spot around well 28 and 23 at the south central region similarly calcium showed the least concentration in the extreme north and the maximum concentration in the south central fig 4b the spatial distribution of sodium and potassium fig 4c and d in the mapped groundwater appears to be distinct and of geogenic sources as observed in the correlation analysis the alkali s concentration decreases southward in the direction of groundwater flow with the least value at the south edges bicarbonate spatial distribution varied widely in the mapped water fig 5 a the southwest edges have the lowest concentration while the extreme north and the south central take the lead the sulfate concentration in the mapped area has a similar spatial variation with chlorine and boron fig 5b c and 5d the three ions have their least concentration in the extreme north and south edges the spatial variation of nitrate nitrogen concentration fig 5e indicates that the west and extreme north area of the mapped area has lower concentration the highest concentration was found in the south central fluoride spatial distribution has the least concentration in southwest and south east with moderate concentration in the south central and northern region a comparison of the spatial maps of the water quality parameters shows that tds mg2 no3 n ec and hco3 exhibited high degree of heterogeneity parameters ph ca2 na k and b showed moderate heterogeneity while cl and so4 2 are more or less homogenous in the area the spatial variation in kr decreases southwardly as seen in sodium fig 6 a the northern region had the highest value this region also had the highest sodium concentration and the lowest calcium concentration as observed in the spatial map ssp showed a similar spatial variation with kr fig 6b the spatial variation of sar took the form of sodium fig 6c the extreme north and a small spot in the south central having the highest values the south edges have the low values the spatial distribution of the mg ca ratio fig 6d in the mapped water indicates that the concentration decreases southwestwardly the geospatial variation of rsc in the sampled groundwater is presented in fig 6e the results showed that the wells fall within the spots of highest rsc value but still less than the maximum permissible limit though there was no discernible trend in the distribution the spatial distribution of the state of equilibria between mg2 and ca2 fig 6f magnesium absorption ratio mar shows a similar variation with mg ca ratio the spatial variation of pi indicates that more than three quarter of the mapped area has pi between 45 and 50 most of the remaining portion has value less than 63 also with no clear cut trend in the distribution in the area the spatial maps also high heterogeneity of rsc mah kr and pi and moderate heterogeneity of mg ca ssp and sar the iwqi spatial variation fig 7 a indicates that the edges of the mapped area have better suitable water as compared to the central regions 4 discussion 4 1 groundwater physicochemical parameters and irrigation 4 1 1 the ph the groundwater is slightly acidic nevertheless some plant species tomato carrot cucumber can tolerate acidic waters whereas others such as celery bean and cabbage are sensitive and they could be lost on any further ph decrease it indicates that certain group of vegetables may not strive if irrigated with this water the low ph value in the southeast which is less than desirable ph for irrigation water can be detrimental to the growth of plants this is because of lock of soil nutrients blocking the uptake by plants boyd 2008 luo et al 2015 furthermore at ph lesser than 6 the microbial conversion of ammonium to nitrate nitrification has low potential luo et al 2015 4 1 2 boron availability according to dyer 2020 boron is an essential micronutrient that occurs naturally in the soil usually in low concentrations that offer no risk to plants however small quantities of boron are necessary for plant growth otherwise signs of boron toxicity yellowing or browning of the foliage result when plants are exposed to higher concentrations especially in irrigation water in this study the concentration of boron in the groundwater samples is tolerable for most plants maja and marija 2007 the most likely source of boron in the groundwater studied is from rocks and soils containing borates and borosilicates other sources like seawater encroachment sewage effluents and fertilizers seems non applicable in the studied area maja and marija 2007 therefore growing boron sensitive vegetables such as lettuce cabbage and corn with these waters is not a problem 4 1 3 cations and anions the abundance of ca2 and mg2 cause reactions with hco3 and co3 and precipitate them as calcite and magnesite bicarbonate hco3 enrichment and abundance in some of the studied water is associated with bedrock dissolution olasehinde et al 2015 bischoff et al 1994 stated the gypsum dissolution drives the precipitation of calcite thus consuming carbonate ions released by dolomite the piper plot also describes the relative abundance of common ions in the studied water with the trilinear plot nagaraju et al 2014 singh et al 2018 the sample suggests the same origin as they trace along a line as classified by olasehinde et al 2015 the hydro chemical facies of the studied water is magnesium calcium bicarbonate and this facies is typical of shallow freshwater the facies and the predominance of hco3 suggests intense chemical weathering processes are taking place in the aquifer which results in the release of ca2 mg2 na k and hco3 into the groundwater adabanija et al 2015 dedzo et al 2017 both na and k tend to have their source from weathered feldspar and clay mineral found in considerable amount in the studied water aquifer adabanija et al 2015 basavarajappa and manjunatha 2015 the abundance of potassium and its exceedance of the upper limit for irrigation is a function of its rapid reaction with water as compared to sodium that occurs in moderate concentration in the studied water both ions are needed in moderate form but elevated concentration of k in the studied water have negative impacts on infiltration water availability and plant growth restricting its use oster et al 2016 a major concern of high potassium concentrations in irrigation water is its deleterious effects on soil hydraulic properties which could have negative impacts on infiltration water availability and plant growth oster et al 2016 the k enrichment results in the formation of a dense network of clay microaggregates and fill up the pore space chen et al 1983 limiting soil hydraulic conductivity according to quirk and schofield 1955 the major mechanisms involved in the decrease of soil hydraulic conductivity due to k are swelling dispersion and clay migration for clay dispersion the detachment of clay from sand particles and their reorganization are the main processes responsible for the reduction in hydraulic conductivity in sodic soils chen and banin 1975 clay migration is two fold first in situ clay particles reorganization following aggregate destruction and pore size decrease results in short range migration while the downward movement of clay particles which form impeded layer constitute the long range migration chen et al 1983 the studied water have comparatively more of mg2 than ca2 however this does not prove deleterious as mg2 in the sampled water behaves as at equal or lower concentration tanvir rahman et al 2017 hence mg2 in the studied water has no negative effect on soil physical properties dontsova and norton 2002 mg2 bonding energy is less than that of ca2 any excess mg2 in irrigation water will allow more na absorption which results in soil dispersion patel and dhiman 2017 salifu et al 2017 irrigating with such water could have adverse effect on crop yields and tends to make soil alkaline hussain et al 2002 nagaraju et al 2014 the anions so4 2 and cl showed moderate concentration and proximate distribution in the studied water posing no threat or hazard effect to plant or soil their significant correlation with magnesium and calcium suggests a geogenic source chloride is a widely distributed element in all types of rocks and sulfate could have originated from highly soluble sulfate bearing minerals mgso4 7h2o epsomite baso4 varite and caso4 2h2o gypsum boyd 2008 the pearson s correlation coefficient was deployed to understand the geochemical process in the groundwater studied wu et al 2017 the significant correlations between the water quality indices and physicochemical properties indicates that the pairs of ions have a similar source in the studied water the correlation analysis testifies to the heterogeneity of the aquifer from which the groundwater is abstracted as suggested by the correlation matrices and the hydro chemical facies water rock interaction chemical weathering is one of the dominant factor controlling water chemistry in the study area a common source of the dominant ions mg2 ca2 and hco3 is carbonate minerals keesari et al 2016 moderate magnesium and calcium content as observed in the studied water influence its suitability for irrigation their relative high proportion to sodium increases soil permeability and water infiltration rate ogunfowokan et al 2013 4 2 geospatial variability according to jabro et al 2010 and paz ferreiro et al 2010 low c0 as observed in ec and tds is an indication of smoother spatial continuity and dependency between adjacent sampling points the spatial variability in models with weak spatial dependency is greatly influenced by stochastic rather than structural factors pointing to variation at microscale smaller than the sampling distances sankar et al 2018 such variation is typical of a natural phenomenon they often vary spatially over a range of scales johnston et al 2001 the variation further attests to the suggestion by the piper diagram of the occurrence of intense chemical weathering in the studied water furthermore the moderate spatial dependence shows that the sampling distance of this study ensured a moderate characterization of the spatial variation of the parameters on the other hand the strong spatial dependence observed for ec and tds could be due to the influence of soil formation characteristics warrick 1998 the spatial maps showed that ionic concentration in the studied groundwater followed predominantly southward and westward flows the wide variation could be limited to the effect of the heterogeneous property of the aquifer or and the existence of point source contamination in the mapped area as earlier stated by adabanija et al 2015 the spatial variation of bicarbonate showed the enrichment and existence of geogenic source of bicarbonate in the studied groundwater as also reported by olasehinde et al 2015 4 3 suitability classification 4 3 1 suitability classification of irrigation water indices the sodium concentration in the studied groundwater was not in excess to combine with carbonate or chloride to form alkali or saline soils that could hinder plant growth hence the alkali hazardous effects of sodium on water quality for irrigation usage in terms of kr ssp and sar were found to be favorable table 7 if the exchangeable sodium percentage ssp of the water is enhanced it could result in an increase in sodium hazard and related problems nagaraju et al 2014 however the indices sar kr and ssp assessing the deteriorating effect of na in the mapped water suggest that the water is suitable for irrigation apparently ca2 exists in sufficient concentration to counter the dispersing effect of na in the studied water tanvir rahman et al 2017 the groundwater studied have moderate rsc values table 7 only one out of the forty samples was unsuitable two were marginal and the rest suitable in quality conversely water with high rsc has high ph and land irrigated by such water becomes infertile owing to the deposition of sodium carbonate keesari et al 2016 according to doneen 1964 classification all the sampled water is delineated class ii 25 pi 75 table 7 this is not an excellent rating but considered good for irrigation calling for some cautions with respect to soil permeability bhat et al 2018 4 3 2 suitability classification of the groundwater for drinking purpose the five major parameters of high concern for water quality for drinking purposes are discussed below 4 3 2 1 total dissolved solid and electrical conductivity the tds revealed the level of minerals that were present in water in dissolved form according to who 2017 the tds comprises inorganic salts and organic matter in small quantities which are in dissolved forms in the water the importance of ec and tds lies in their effect on the corrosivity of water sample and their effect on the solubility of slightly soluble compounds such as caco3 however the concentration in water vary considerably as a result of differences in the geological regions arising from varying solubility of minerals adhikary and dash 2012 although the maximum and mean values of the tds was below the maximum recommended value 1000 mg l 1 who 2017 therefore the wide range of tds observed is a function of the varying degree of solubility of minerals present in the area similarly both the average and maximum values of ec were far below the permissible level of 1400 μs m for drinking water who 2017 indicating the suitability 4 3 2 2 chloride chlorides occur in all natural waters in widely varying concentrations which increases with increasing mineral content sawyer and mccarthy 1978 according to who 2017 chloride in drinking water comes from natural sources sewage and industrial effluents urban runoff containing de icing salt and saline intrusion natural waters contain chloride ion but at low concentrations usually below 100 mg l 1 otherwise the water becomes brackish or saline fetter 1999 an increase in chlorine concentration beyond 100 mg l 1 in water give rise to a detectable taste while chloride concentrations in excess of 250 mg l 1 already have a salty taste who 2017 in this study both the maximum and average values of the chloride ion concentration were far below the permissible level of 250 mg l 1 for drinking water who 2017 indicating all the sampled wells have normal taste 4 3 2 3 nitrate nitrates are the end product of aerobic stabilization of organic nitrogen and a product of conversion of nitrogenous material and as such occur in polluted water belkhiri and mouni 2014 in this study no3 n poses no threat for drinking purposes as both the maximum and mean values were far below the maximum permissible limit of 50 mg l 1 who 2017 although potential elevated nitrate concentrations could occur due to decaying plant or animal material use agricultural fertilizers domestic sewage areas of high density animal confinement improper operation and maintenance of septic systems existing within the studied area however it could be that the lack of permeability associated with basement complex rocks seems to be preventing the downward leaching of nitrogen by surface water singh and sekhon 1979 olasehinde et al 2015 singh et al 2018 the filtering capacity of the soil also comes into play according to keesstra et al 2012 the groundwater is an essential source of water for drinking and irrigation and is highly connected to the surface waters it is important to explore into how the groundwater recharge and therefore its quality is affected by the soil through which it flows in this context the behavior and transport of pollutants strongly depends on the filtering function of soil for instance applied nutrients or pesticides can be retained by the soil organic and inorganic compounds originating from agricultural municipal or industrial by products can be filtered buffered and immobilized by clay minerals and the organic matter and degraded by soil biota however the efficiency of the soil as a buffer and filter for pollutants is strongly determined by the adsorption and degradation rate in the filter and the residence time which depend on the transport processes of the soil and concentration of the pollutants 4 3 2 4 total hardness total hardness of water is a function of the concentration of substances such as the ca2 and mg2 the hardness in water is caused mostly by dissolved ca and by mg to a lesser extent and thus it is has been expressed as the equivalent quantity of caco3 who 2017 sawyer and mccarthy 1978 stated that water hardness reflects the nature of the geological formations with which it has been in contact it has been reported that the public acceptability of the degree of hardness may vary considerably from one region to another depending on prevailing local conditions the taste of water with hardness in excess of 500 mg l 1 is considered tolerable in some clime but according to who 2017 guidelines the hardness level in water should not be above 600 mg l 1 in this study the groundwater water sampled have comparatively more of mg2 than ca2 therefore there is less concern for hardness in water due to ca2 although some area had mg2 slightly above the maximum permissible limit 55 mg l 1 by who 2017 this was not a problem as the maximum and average values of the total hardness are below the maximum permissible limit with moderate variability in the area 4 4 overall water quality index the water quality index wqi is the sum of normalized values of individual groundwater parameters the irrigation water quality index iwqi values obtained were within the fao maximum contamination limit andreas 2007 the central region is highly inhabited fig 1 its higher index seems to be a response to population density high water demand and proliferation of wells also some wells located in the south central region needs to be frequently monitored this region has the highest index value 0 3 0 46 and concentration on other spatial maps in general the water studied is suitable for irrigation purposes most areas have an index below 0 3 similarly the overall drinking water quality index dwqi revealed good 22 5 and excellent 77 5 conditions indicating special monitoring is required to upgrade those well in good conditions with a view to forestalling deterioration table 7 however wqi reflects the composite influence of different quality parameters and does not override the presence of constituents that may pose threat to the effective use of groundwater in the study area for irrigation and potable uses as highlighted above according to rawat and singh 2018 wqi has the potential for decision making and management in flag contaminate of concern predicts potentially harmful conditions guides prioritization management efforts and funds assess overall impacts of water quality interventions communicate impacts of management and policy decisions monitor water resource and health the wqi output values of the groundwater observed for both irrigation and drinking purposes suggest the water quality status ranging from good to excellent with minimal degree of pollution 5 conclusions the physicochemical parameters of the groundwater showed low to moderate variability all the physicochemical parameters are within the benchmark value prescribed by fao andreas 2007 and who 2017 quality guidelines except ph and k for irrigation water and mg2 for drinking water in few locations piper s trilinear diagram and correlation analysis indicated that geogenic source has unrivaled influence in the groundwater chemistry the geospatial analysis revealed weak to strong spatial dependent as well as heterogeneity of the water quality parameters both the irrigation and drinking water quality indices showed significant correlation with the physicochemical parameters except hco3 na and k the suitability classification of the studied water for irrigation as assessed by sar kr ssp pi rsc mg ca and mar showed varying degrees of suitability for use rsc specifically has locations with doubtful and unsuitable classifications while both mg ca and pi did not show excellent conditions hence periodic assessment of the water quality is required to prevent hazards related to long term use of the water on the soil and irrigation facilities the overall iwqi and dwqi indicate that the groundwater within the study area are found to be safe for irrigation and drinking purposes however caution must be taken as regards the deficiencies observed with some important indices that makes up the whole furthermore the effect of rainfall dilution on water quality has been identified therefore the susceptible of the studied water to seasonal variation need to be assessed declaration of

12013,application of groundwater for domestic and agricultural uses has increased in sub sahara africa however geology and anthropogenic activities can impact groundwater quality but information on quality evaluation and suitability classification of groundwater based on water quality index wqi is limited thus this study evaluated the spatial variability of groundwater quality and its suitability for potable and irrigation purposes in a precambrian complex of southwest nigeria water samples were collected from 40 wells across the study area and analyzed for physicochemical properties suitability for domestic and irrigation uses were determined maps showing spatial variations of ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solid tds total hardness th cations ca2 mg2 na and k anions so4 2 cl no3 n po3 p b f and hco3 and irrigation water quality index iwqi and drinking water quality index dwqi were produced using arcgis the average values of ph ec tds and th were 6 6 0 3 ds m 1 152 4 mg l 1 and 208 7 mg l 1 respectively the concentrations of ca2 mg2 k and na were 28 7 32 8 2 49 and 7 13 mg l 1 respectively whereas so4 2 cl no3 n po3 p b f and hco3 concentrations were 20 4 0 32 0 46 0 04 0 39 0 42 and 230 7 mg l 1 respectively the quality indices for irrigation iwqi and drinking dwqi were 0 22 and 0 75 respectively the iwqi significantly correlated with mg2 th so4 2 ph and tds p 0 05 r 0 34 0 66 whilst dwqi significantly correlated with tds so4 2 cl no3 n po3 p ca2 mg2 ph th and f p 0 05 r 0 38 0 93 the suitability classification of the groundwater quality in the area shows that 100 and 78 of the water are safe for irrigation and domestic purposes respectively however regular quality monitoring of the groundwater is recommended in order to avert likely deterioration indicated by some quality parameters graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater water quality index irrigation water drinking water kriging 1 introduction in many urban and sub urban centers in africa and asia groundwater has become the main source of water supply for both domestic and agricultural purposes lapworth et al 2017 kawo and karuppannan 2018 and this may be due to reduction in availability and quality of surface water resources beyene et al 2019 globally groundwater provides potable water for about 1 5 billion people dfid 2001 and accounts for about 43 of total irrigation water use siebert et al 2010 groundwater is considered more suitable for irrigation when compared to surface water siebert et al 2010 however the quality of groundwater is influenced by both natural and anthropogenic activities moyo 2013 nair et al 2015 li et al 2017 wu et al 2017 adabanija et al 2020 when water flows through the rocks and sediments it picks naturally occurring pollutants such as dissolved metals and salts moyo 2013 urbanization and industrialization due to complexity in lifestyle as well as agricultural intensification due to population increase have also caused serious degradation to groundwater quality lucas et al 2005 nyakatawa et al 2006 carpenter 2008 kazi et al 2009 abegunrin and sangodoyin 2016 li 2016 li et al 2017 for example nyakatawa et al 2006 reported that excess fertilizer applied to agricultural fields will either be exported to surface waterbodies or infiltrate into the soil and later join groundwater previous groundwater quality research reports varying degrees of quality status by evaluating each of the physical chemical and biological data in assessing water quality discreetly adabanija et al 2015 2020 rahman et al 2017 bhunia et al 2018 kawo and karuppannan 2018 beyene et al 2019 gharbi et al 2019 yusuf and abiye 2019 most of the assessments are cumbersome and sometimes the conclusions could not be easily understood for example in suitability evaluation of groundwater quality for drinking and irrigation purposes in ethiopia by beyene et al 2019 the comparison of individual measured parameters was only made with the world health organization who standards and plotted wilcox 1955 and united state salinity laboratory diagrams this method could be misleading because a water may be found suitable in terms of one parameter and not in terms of another parameter meanwhile they beyene et al 2019 concluded that 68 8 of the water is good for irrigation but high concentration of f and na make the water unsuitable for drinking and irrigation purpose however a recent approach that bridge this gap is the application of an overall water quality index wqi the wqi is a tool developed to summarize the complex multiple water quality parameters into a single score abegunrin et al 2016a the score is ranked into classes such as excellent good or unsuitable to express suitability of the water for specific purposes howladar et al 2017 baba et al 2020 various mathematical and statistical methods have been employed to derive wqi this often involves parameter selection transformation weighing and aggregation srebotnjak et al 2012 rahman and bodrud doza 2018 the wqi has been demonstrated as a formidable tool for interpretation monitoring predicting and comparing the overall water quality status in a consistent manner abegunrin et al 2016a kawo and karuppannan 2018 sankar et al 2018 harbi et al 2019 however the water quality evaluation in ogbomoso a metropolitan in southwestern nigeria has been a subject of many studies but such studies have been based on individual parameters with limited study on the overall wqi adabanija et al 2015 abegunrin et al 2016a adabanija et al 2020 in the same vein previous studies rarely include spatial variability of groundwater quality in the assessment of groundwater in this region kumar 2006 stated that a complete assessment and sustainable management of groundwater require reliable information on its variability with spatial data this often requires the ability to georeferenced and analyzed data using spatial statistical methods as elucidated by geographic information system gis software it is evident from many studies that spatial techniques are useful for comprehensive evaluation and characterization of groundwater quality and to check its degradation for sustainable management kawo and karuppannan 2018 gharbi et al 2019 baba et al 2020 the technique could also guide in delineation of a region to specific management zones rather than handling individual well in this context the objectives of the study were to evaluate the spatial variability of groundwater quality and its suitability for irrigation and domestic uses in a precambrian complex of ogbomoso in southwest nigeria and to produce spatial variation maps of physicochemical properties of groundwater irrigation water quality index iwqi and drinking water quality index dwqi 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area the study was conducted in ogbomoso 8 00 n 8 15 n 4 10 e 4 20 e southwest nigeria the area is characterized with mean annual rainfall of 1200 mm a mean annual maximum and minimum temperatures of 33 and 28 c respectively abegunrin et al 2016b the prevailing climatic condition is tropical with alternating wet season lasting from april to october and the dry season from november to march the location is concealed within the southwestern nigeria precambrian basement complex known for its low porosity 1 and negligible permeability in its unaltered form afolabi et al 2013 oladunjoye et al 2015 thus the occurrence of groundwater in the study area is localized and concentrated within the weathered layer and the fractured underlying rock unit oladunjoye et al 2015 gneisses are the dominant rock type with migmatite gneiss dominating the northern and the southwestern parts while the remaining part was dominated by quartzite the area has high amphibolite facies minerals plagioclase potash feldspar quartz biotite and muscovite the terrain is suspected to be faulted at the southern and northeastern part of the town predominantly groundwater in ogbomoso flows southward and westward adabanija et al 2015 2 2 groundwater sampling the groundwater samples were collected in july 2018 from forty 40 wells spread across the study area fig 1 the 40 wells were randomly selected from lot of available wells across the study area the samples were collected two replicates in 200 ml sampling bottles that have been previously washed with nitric acid 1 1 hno3 h2o solution and thereafter rinsed with distilled water to disinfect the bottles at each site samples were collected after about 10 12 min pumping the collected samples were filtered using 0 45 μm whatman filter paper grade 2 the filtrates were divided into two one part for cations analyses and the other for anions the samples for cations analyses were acidified with 2 ml hno3 to a ph 2 after collection all sample bottles were sealed marked and placed in ice pack container and thereafter transferred to the laboratory for further analyses in the laboratory the samples were kept in the refrigerator at 4 c and all analyses were done within 48 h a global positioning system gps garmin etrex 10 was employed in determining the geographical positions of the sampled wells 2 3 physical and chemical analysis and calculations the groundwater samples were analyzed for ph total dissolved solid tds and electrical conductivity ec ca2 mg2 k na so4 2 cl no3 n po3 p b f alkalinity hco3 and co3 2 and total hardness th sodium adsorption ratio sar kelly ratio kr soluble sodium percentage ssp residual sodium carbonate rsc permeability index pi and magnesium adsorption ratio mar were calculated using empirical formulae the ph total dissolved solid tds and electrical conductivity ec were measured in situ ph was measured with ph meter phs 3c while tds and ec with a multi parameter analyzer dzs 706 colorimetric methods were used to analyzed ca2 mg2 k na so4 2 cl no3 n po3 p b and f using pallintest photometer 7100 apha 2005 alkalinity hco3 and co3 2 and total

richards 1954 eq 3 residual sodium carbonate rsc was expressed as 4 rsc co 3 2 hco 3 ca 2 mg 2 permeability index pi was calculated as described by doneen 1964 eq 5 5 pi na hco 3 ca 2 mg 2 na 100 magnesium adsorption ratio mar sometimes referred to as magnesium hazard mh was calculated according to eq 6 tanvir rahman et al 2017 as 6 mar mg 2 ca 2 mg 2 where na ca2 mg2 co3 hco3 is sodium calcium magnesium carbonate and bicarbonate concentration respectively the concentration of ions is expressed in meq l 1 for sar kr pi and mar others are in mg l 1 2 5 water quality index wqi the combined impact of the water quality parameters on irrigation was assessed by the wqi the formula is described in eq 6 baba et al 2020 four parameters with assigned weight 1 5 based on their importance for water quality assessment were used in calculating the wqi sundararajan and sabarathinam 2014 howladar et al 2017 baba et al 2020 a weighting factor of 3 5 3 2 and 1 5 was assigned for ec sar hco3 and mg ca ratio respectively 7a wqi 1 n i 1 n ω i q i s i qi is the measured water quality parameter at sampling location i si is the maximum permissible limit of that water quality parameter ωi is the weighing factor and n represents the sum of the number of quality parameters multiplied by their weight the classification of the suitability of water based on wqi is presented in table 1 the nearer the wqi value gets closer to 1 the nearer the water ions value to the benchmark value baba et al 2020 2 6 data analysis 2 6 1 descriptive statistics the dataset were subjected to descriptive statistics to determine the maximum minimum mean standard deviation skewness and kurtosis the coefficient of variation was calculated from the mean and standard deviation pearson correlation analysis was performed between the groundwater quality indices and physico chemical variables the statistics were performed in spss ibm version 20 2 6 2 geospatial analysis the sampling points were georeferenced in google earth the coordinates and concentration value were imported to arcgis as a spreadsheet esri arcmap 10 3 1 and its geostatistical analyst extension was use to prepared the thematic maps of groundwater quality parameters the steps include data transformation semivariogram modelling interpolation and cross validation log transformation was applied to the dataset to normalize the data distribution and suppress outliers varouchakis et al 2012 the spatial dependence of the data was assessed with a semivariogram the spatial structure of the semivariogram was characterized based on the nugget sill ratio less than 25 indicates strong spatial dependency ssd and more than 75 indicates weak spatial dependency wsd otherwise the spatial dependency is moderate cambardella et al 1994 ordinary kriging ok was used as the spatial interpolation method cross validation was used to assess the accuracy of the models using prediction error statistics mean error me mean standardized error mse average standard error ase root mean square error rmse and root mean standard square error rmsse the experimental semivariogram values were calculated from the measured data using the measure of moment approach adhikary and dash 2012 7b γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z x i h z x i 2 γ h represents the semivariogram n h is the number of observation pairs for xi and xi h and z xi is the variable at location xi 3 results 3 1 descriptive statistics of physicochemical parameters and water quality indices the descriptive statistics of the physicochemical properties of the groundwater is summarized in table 2 the total dissolved solid tds and electrical conductivity ec of the studied water showed high variability 0 77 and 0 80 respectively an indication of the presence of a varying degree of dissolved salts the ph varied from 5 85 to 6 96 with a mean value of 6 64 the skewness value of 1 49 indicated that the ph of most of the water samples is lower than the mean

essential plant nutrients but are found in low concentration in the studied water maximum value of 0 06 and 0 8 mg l 1 respectively boron concentration in the groundwater has a maximum value of 0 62

all the sampled wells having sar far from the fao benchmark value of 10 meq l 1 the magnesium calcium ratio varied from 1 25 to 2 42 mg l 1 with 90 of the groundwater samples good for irrigation whereas only 10 were excellent the kelly ratio kr an indicator of excess sodium in irrigation water has a maximum value of 0 06 meq l 1 similarly the proportion of sodium with that of total cations soluble sodium percentage ssp has a maximum value of 5 25 mg l 1 compared to the maximum permissible limit of 50 mg l 1 the classification also revealed all the sampling wells are safe for irrigation the interactions between ca2 mg 2 na hco3 and co3 2 in the studied water as reflected by residual sodium carbonates rsc the rsc varied widely nevertheless over 90 of the sampled wells are suitable for irrigation while about 5 and 3 are doubtful or not suitable respectively the permeability index pi indicates that the samples are well dispersed around the mean the classification showed that all the sampled groundwater were good for irrigation the oveerall irrigation water quality index iwqi had values less than one 1 in all case indicating their suitability for irrigation purposes similarly the overall drinking water quality index dwqi ranged between 0 10 and 0 34 mean 0 21 table 3 3 2 correlation analysis as typical of natural waters ec and tds had the highest correlation matrices 0 99 both parameters correlate strongly with hco3 however hco3 only correlated significantly with ec and tds and moderately with na and k which only have a strong correlation with each other table 4 this suggests that hco3 greatly influence the salt concentration of the studied water and hco3 na and k have a similar source all other ions showed strong positive correlation with one another apart from ec that was considered for its computation it is interesting to note that the iwqi showed significant correlation with the water quality variables mg2 th p 0 01 r 0 66 and 0 47 and so4 2 ph tds p 0 05 r 0 34 0 37 and 0 35 respectively and dwqi showed significant correlation with so4 2 cl no3 n ca2 mg2 ph th and f p 0 01 r 0 50 0 76 0 50 0 49 0 66 0 52 0 66 and 0 93 respectively and with tds p 0 05 r 0 38 table 4 3 3 piper plot and spatial structure of groundwater quality parameters the piper plot is presented in fig 2 alkaline earth metals ca2 and mg2 dominated the alkalis na and k while the weak acids bicarbonates exceeded the strong acids so4 2 and cl the water chemistry is outweighed by alkali and weak acids table 5 shows the characteristics of the spatial structures of the water quality variables the best fit semivariogram models classification indices and overall quality index in this study the semivariogram models circular spherical tetra spherical penta spherical exponential gaussian rational quadratic hole effect k bessel j bessel stable were tested for each parameter ec and tds showed strong spatial dependency mg2 na no3 hco3 and ph showed moderate spatial dependency while ca2 so4 2 cl b and k had a weak spatial dependency k has the highest spatial correlation distance the range mg2 has the minimum followed by na and cl stable model was fitted for ca2 and na hole effect mg2 so4 2 k and no3 gaussian hco3 ec tds and b exponential cl and ph all models have me close to 0 lowest and closest ase and rmse and rmsse close to 1 indicating a good fit by the kriging process table 6 3 4 geospatial maps of the water quality parameters and indices the parameters highly consider for water quality ec and tds fig 3 a and b have a similar but wide spatial variation across the mapped water this is in congruence with their cv 0 8 and 0 77 respectively the spatial variation decreases transversely from the center and increase southwardly in the south central region there exist a spot having both tds and ec in the doubtful range tds 450 mg l 1 and ec 0 75 ds m the spatial variation of ph fig 3c in the studied water is dominantly slight to moderate acidic the southeast edge of the mapped area could have ph value less than desirable ph for irrigation water 6 5 to 8 5 the spatial map of magnesium fig 4 a seems proximate the sampling points have values closer to the neighboring points most of the mapped area has moderate concentration the highest concentration was found on a small spot around well 28 and 23 at the south central region similarly calcium showed the least concentration in the extreme north and the maximum concentration in the south central fig 4b the spatial distribution of sodium and potassium fig 4c and d in the mapped groundwater appears to be distinct and of geogenic sources as observed in the correlation analysis the alkali s concentration decreases southward in the direction of groundwater flow with the least value at the south edges bicarbonate spatial distribution varied widely in the mapped water fig 5 a the southwest edges have the lowest concentration while the extreme north and the south central take the lead the sulfate concentration in the mapped area has a similar spatial variation with chlorine and boron fig 5b c and 5d the three ions have their least concentration in the extreme north and south edges the spatial variation of nitrate nitrogen concentration fig 5e indicates that the west and extreme north area of the mapped area has lower concentration the highest concentration was found in the south central fluoride spatial distribution has the least concentration in southwest and south east with moderate concentration in the south central and northern region a comparison of the spatial maps of the water quality parameters shows that tds mg2 no3 n ec and hco3 exhibited high degree of heterogeneity parameters ph ca2 na k and b showed moderate heterogeneity while cl and so4 2 are more or less homogenous in the area the spatial variation in kr decreases southwardly as seen in sodium fig 6 a the northern region had the highest value this region also had the highest sodium concentration and the lowest calcium concentration as observed in the spatial map ssp showed a similar spatial variation with kr fig 6b the spatial variation of sar took the form of sodium fig 6c the extreme north and a small spot in the south central having the highest values the south edges have the low values the spatial distribution of the mg ca ratio fig 6d in the mapped water indicates that the concentration decreases southwestwardly the geospatial variation of rsc in the sampled groundwater is presented in fig 6e the results showed that the wells fall within the spots of highest rsc value but still less than the maximum permissible limit though there was no discernible trend in the distribution the spatial distribution of the state of equilibria between mg2 and ca2 fig 6f magnesium absorption ratio mar shows a similar variation with mg ca ratio the spatial variation of pi indicates that more than three quarter of the mapped area has pi between 45 and 50 most of the remaining portion has value less than 63 also with no clear cut trend in the distribution in the area the spatial maps also high heterogeneity of rsc mah kr and pi and moderate heterogeneity of mg ca ssp and sar the iwqi spatial variation fig 7 a indicates that the edges of the mapped area have better suitable water as compared to the central regions 4 discussion 4 1 groundwater physicochemical parameters and irrigation 4 1 1 the ph the groundwater is slightly acidic nevertheless some plant species tomato carrot cucumber can tolerate acidic waters whereas others such as celery bean and cabbage are sensitive and they could be lost on any further ph decrease it indicates that certain group of vegetables may not strive if irrigated with this water the low ph value in the southeast which is less than desirable ph for irrigation water can be detrimental to the growth of plants this is because of lock of soil nutrients blocking the uptake by plants boyd 2008 luo et al 2015 furthermore at ph lesser than 6 the microbial conversion of ammonium to nitrate nitrification has low potential luo et al 2015 4 1 2 boron availability according to dyer 2020 boron is an essential micronutrient that occurs naturally in the soil usually in low concentrations that offer no risk to plants however small quantities of boron are necessary for plant growth otherwise signs of boron toxicity yellowing or browning of the foliage result when plants are exposed to higher concentrations especially in irrigation water in this study the concentration of boron in the groundwater samples is tolerable for most plants maja and marija 2007 the most likely source of boron in the groundwater studied is from rocks and soils containing borates and borosilicates other sources like seawater encroachment sewage effluents and fertilizers seems non applicable in the studied area maja and marija 2007 therefore growing boron sensitive vegetables such as lettuce cabbage and corn with these waters is not a problem 4 1 3 cations and anions the abundance of ca2 and mg2 cause reactions with hco3 and co3 and precipitate them as calcite and magnesite bicarbonate hco3 enrichment and abundance in some of the studied water is associated with bedrock dissolution olasehinde et al 2015 bischoff et al 1994 stated the gypsum dissolution drives the precipitation of calcite thus consuming carbonate ions released by dolomite the piper plot also describes the relative abundance of common ions in the studied water with the trilinear plot nagaraju et al 2014 singh et al 2018 the sample suggests the same origin as they trace along a line as classified by olasehinde et al 2015 the hydro chemical facies of the studied water is magnesium calcium bicarbonate and this facies is typical of shallow freshwater the facies and the predominance of hco3 suggests intense chemical weathering processes are taking place in the aquifer which results in the release of ca2 mg2 na k and hco3 into the groundwater adabanija et al 2015 dedzo et al 2017 both na and k tend to have their source from weathered feldspar and clay mineral found in considerable amount in the studied water aquifer adabanija et al 2015 basavarajappa and manjunatha 2015 the abundance of potassium and its exceedance of the upper limit for irrigation is a function of its rapid reaction with water as compared to sodium that occurs in moderate concentration in the studied water both ions are needed in moderate form but elevated concentration of k in the studied water have negative impacts on infiltration water availability and plant growth restricting its use oster et al 2016 a major concern of high potassium concentrations in irrigation water is its deleterious effects on soil hydraulic properties which could have negative impacts on infiltration water availability and plant growth oster et al 2016 the k enrichment results in the formation of a dense network of clay microaggregates and fill up the pore space chen et al 1983 limiting soil hydraulic conductivity according to quirk and schofield 1955 the major mechanisms involved in the decrease of soil hydraulic conductivity due to k are swelling dispersion and clay migration for clay dispersion the detachment of clay from sand particles and their reorganization are the main processes responsible for the reduction in hydraulic conductivity in sodic soils chen and banin 1975 clay migration is two fold first in situ clay particles reorganization following aggregate destruction and pore size decrease results in short range migration while the downward movement of clay particles which form impeded layer constitute the long range migration chen et al 1983 the studied water have comparatively more of mg2 than ca2 however this does not prove deleterious as mg2 in the sampled water behaves as at equal or lower concentration tanvir rahman et al 2017 hence mg2 in the studied water has no negative effect on soil physical properties dontsova and norton 2002 mg2 bonding energy is less than that of ca2 any excess mg2 in irrigation water will allow more na absorption which results in soil dispersion patel and dhiman 2017 salifu et al 2017 irrigating with such water could have adverse effect on crop yields and tends to make soil alkaline hussain et al 2002 nagaraju et al 2014 the anions so4 2 and cl showed moderate concentration and proximate distribution in the studied water posing no threat or hazard effect to plant or soil their significant correlation with magnesium and calcium suggests a geogenic source chloride is a widely distributed element in all types of rocks and sulfate could have originated from highly soluble sulfate bearing minerals mgso4 7h2o epsomite baso4 varite and caso4 2h2o gypsum boyd 2008 the pearson s correlation coefficient was deployed to understand the geochemical process in the groundwater studied wu et al 2017 the significant correlations between the water quality indices and physicochemical properties indicates that the pairs of ions have a similar source in the studied water the correlation analysis testifies to the heterogeneity of the aquifer from which the groundwater is abstracted as suggested by the correlation matrices and the hydro chemical facies water rock interaction chemical weathering is one of the dominant factor controlling water chemistry in the study area a common source of the dominant ions mg2 ca2 and hco3 is carbonate minerals keesari et al 2016 moderate magnesium and calcium content as observed in the studied water influence its suitability for irrigation their relative high proportion to sodium increases soil permeability and water infiltration rate ogunfowokan et al 2013 4 2 geospatial variability according to jabro et al 2010 and paz ferreiro et al 2010 low c0 as observed in ec and tds is an indication of smoother spatial continuity and dependency between adjacent sampling points the spatial variability in models with weak spatial dependency is greatly influenced by stochastic rather than structural factors pointing to variation at microscale smaller than the sampling distances sankar et al 2018 such variation is typical of a natural phenomenon they often vary spatially over a range of scales johnston et al 2001 the variation further attests to the suggestion by the piper diagram of the occurrence of intense chemical weathering in the studied water furthermore the moderate spatial dependence shows that the sampling distance of this study ensured a moderate characterization of the spatial variation of the parameters on the other hand the strong spatial dependence observed for ec and tds could be due to the influence of soil formation characteristics warrick 1998 the spatial maps showed that ionic concentration in the studied groundwater followed predominantly southward and westward flows the wide variation could be limited to the effect of the heterogeneous property of the aquifer or and the existence of point source contamination in the mapped area as earlier stated by adabanija et al 2015 the spatial variation of bicarbonate showed the enrichment and existence of geogenic source of bicarbonate in the studied groundwater as also reported by olasehinde et al 2015 4 3 suitability classification 4 3 1 suitability classification of irrigation water indices the sodium concentration in the studied groundwater was not in excess to combine with carbonate or chloride to form alkali or saline soils that could hinder plant growth hence the alkali hazardous effects of sodium on water quality for irrigation usage in terms of kr ssp and sar were found to be favorable table 7 if the exchangeable sodium percentage ssp of the water is enhanced it could result in an increase in sodium hazard and related problems nagaraju et al 2014 however the indices sar kr and ssp assessing the deteriorating effect of na in the mapped water suggest that the water is suitable for irrigation apparently ca2 exists in sufficient concentration to counter the dispersing effect of na in the studied water tanvir rahman et al 2017 the groundwater studied have moderate rsc values table 7 only one out of the forty samples was unsuitable two were marginal and the rest suitable in quality conversely water with high rsc has high ph and land irrigated by such water becomes infertile owing to the deposition of sodium carbonate keesari et al 2016 according to doneen 1964 classification all the sampled water is delineated class ii 25 pi 75 table 7 this is not an excellent rating but considered good for irrigation calling for some cautions with respect to soil permeability bhat et al 2018 4 3 2 suitability classification of the groundwater for drinking purpose the five major parameters of high concern for water quality for drinking purposes are discussed below 4 3 2 1 total dissolved solid and electrical conductivity the tds revealed the level of minerals that were present in water in dissolved form according to who 2017 the tds comprises inorganic salts and organic matter in small quantities which are in dissolved forms in the water the importance of ec and tds lies in their effect on the corrosivity of water sample and their effect on the solubility of slightly soluble compounds such as caco3 however the concentration in water vary considerably as a result of differences in the geological regions arising from varying solubility of minerals adhikary and dash 2012 although the maximum and mean values of the tds was below the maximum recommended value 1000 mg l 1 who 2017 therefore the wide range of tds observed is a function of the varying degree of solubility of minerals present in the area similarly both the average and maximum values of ec were far below the permissible level of 1400 μs m for drinking water who 2017 indicating the suitability 4 3 2 2 chloride chlorides occur in all natural waters in widely varying concentrations which increases with increasing mineral content sawyer and mccarthy 1978 according to who 2017 chloride in drinking water comes from natural sources sewage and industrial effluents urban runoff containing de icing salt and saline intrusion natural waters contain chloride ion but at low concentrations usually below 100 mg l 1 otherwise the water becomes brackish or saline fetter 1999 an increase in chlorine concentration beyond 100 mg l 1 in water give rise to a detectable taste while chloride concentrations in excess of 250 mg l 1 already have a salty taste who 2017 in this study both the maximum and average values of the chloride ion concentration were far below the permissible level of 250 mg l 1 for drinking water who 2017 indicating all the sampled wells have normal taste 4 3 2 3 nitrate nitrates are the end product of aerobic stabilization of organic nitrogen and a product of conversion of nitrogenous material and as such occur in polluted water belkhiri and mouni 2014 in this study no3 n poses no threat for drinking purposes as both the maximum and mean values were far below the maximum permissible limit of 50 mg l 1 who 2017 although potential elevated nitrate concentrations could occur due to decaying plant or animal material use agricultural fertilizers domestic sewage areas of high density animal confinement improper operation and maintenance of septic systems existing within the studied area however it could be that the lack of permeability associated with basement complex rocks seems to be preventing the downward leaching of nitrogen by surface water singh and sekhon 1979 olasehinde et al 2015 singh et al 2018 the filtering capacity of the soil also comes into play according to keesstra et al 2012 the groundwater is an essential source of water for drinking and irrigation and is highly connected to the surface waters it is important to explore into how the groundwater recharge and therefore its quality is affected by the soil through which it flows in this context the behavior and transport of pollutants strongly depends on the filtering function of soil for instance applied nutrients or pesticides can be retained by the soil organic and inorganic compounds originating from agricultural municipal or industrial by products can be filtered buffered and immobilized by clay minerals and the organic matter and degraded by soil biota however the efficiency of the soil as a buffer and filter for pollutants is strongly determined by the adsorption and degradation rate in the filter and the residence time which depend on the transport processes of the soil and concentration of the pollutants 4 3 2 4 total hardness total hardness of water is a function of the concentration of substances such as the ca2 and mg2 the hardness in water is caused mostly by dissolved ca and by mg to a lesser extent and thus it is has been expressed as the equivalent quantity of caco3 who 2017 sawyer and mccarthy 1978 stated that water hardness reflects the nature of the geological formations with which it has been in contact it has been reported that the public acceptability of the degree of hardness may vary considerably from one region to another depending on prevailing local conditions the taste of water with hardness in excess of 500 mg l 1 is considered tolerable in some clime but according to who 2017 guidelines the hardness level in water should not be above 600 mg l 1 in this study the groundwater water sampled have comparatively more of mg2 than ca2 therefore there is less concern for hardness in water due to ca2 although some area had mg2 slightly above the maximum permissible limit 55 mg l 1 by who 2017 this was not a problem as the maximum and average values of the total hardness are below the maximum permissible limit with moderate variability in the area 4 4 overall water quality index the water quality index wqi is the sum of normalized values of individual groundwater parameters the irrigation water quality index iwqi values obtained were within the fao maximum contamination limit andreas 2007 the central region is highly inhabited fig 1 its higher index seems to be a response to population density high water demand and proliferation of wells also some wells located in the south central region needs to be frequently monitored this region has the highest index value 0 3 0 46 and concentration on other spatial maps in general the water studied is suitable for irrigation purposes most areas have an index below 0 3 similarly the overall drinking water quality index dwqi revealed good 22 5 and excellent 77 5 conditions indicating special monitoring is required to upgrade those well in good conditions with a view to forestalling deterioration table 7 however wqi reflects the composite influence of different quality parameters and does not override the presence of constituents that may pose threat to the effective use of groundwater in the study area for irrigation and potable uses as highlighted above according to rawat and singh 2018 wqi has the potential for decision making and management in flag contaminate of concern predicts potentially harmful conditions guides prioritization management efforts and funds assess overall impacts of water quality interventions communicate impacts of management and policy decisions monitor water resource and health the wqi output values of the groundwater observed for both irrigation and drinking purposes suggest the water quality status ranging from good to excellent with minimal degree of pollution 5 conclusions the physicochemical parameters of the groundwater showed low to moderate variability all the physicochemical parameters are within the benchmark value prescribed by fao andreas 2007 and who 2017 quality guidelines except ph and k for irrigation water and mg2 for drinking water in few locations piper s trilinear diagram and correlation analysis indicated that geogenic source has unrivaled influence in the groundwater chemistry the geospatial analysis revealed weak to strong spatial dependent as well as heterogeneity of the water quality parameters both the irrigation and drinking water quality indices showed significant correlation with the physicochemical parameters except hco3 na and k the suitability classification of the studied water for irrigation as assessed by sar kr ssp pi rsc mg ca and mar showed varying degrees of suitability for use rsc specifically has locations with doubtful and unsuitable classifications while both mg ca and pi did not show excellent conditions hence periodic assessment of the water quality is required to prevent hazards related to long term use of the water on the soil and irrigation facilities the overall iwqi and dwqi indicate that the groundwater within the study area are found to be safe for irrigation and drinking purposes however caution must be taken as regards the deficiencies observed with some important indices that makes up the whole furthermore the effect of rainfall dilution on water quality has been identified therefore the susceptible of the studied water to seasonal variation need to be assessed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

12014,groundwater gw is a vital source of water supply for drinking irrigation and industry in most parts of india in punjab the adoption of the rice wheat cropping system has led to a manifold increase in the irrigation water demand and about 73 of it is met from gw consequently the gw level in the state is declining rapidly due to its overuse and misuse to conserve irrigation water the government has recently taken some initiatives including enacting the preservation of sub soil water act 2009 which prohibits early transplanting of rice for reducing unproductive evaporation and thereby the irrigation demand this paper attempts to assess the impact of such measures on the gw depletion between the year 2000 and 2019 during this period the average gw depletion in punjab is about 8 91 m with the highest depletion of about 20 38 m in barnala district the depth to the water table maps indicate that the area of the state having depth to water table more than 10 m has increased from about 30 in 2000 to more than 75 in 2019 the water table elevation maps show the development of gw depression cones in areas with excessive over exploitation and thereby a likely reversal in the direction of gw flow the time is fast approaching when the state shall have to undertake comprehensive water budgeting and appropriate policy initiatives to address the concerns of the depleting gw trend graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater level flow direction depletion recent initiatives water footprint 1 introduction the combined effect of climate change erratic monsoon and the growing population of india is contributing to an increasing dependence of the population on gw siebert et al 2010 consequently the groundwater resources are depleting at analarming rate throughout the country ground water year book and 2 2014 bonsor et al 2017 krishan et al kumar macdonald et al gopalet al macdonald et al 2016 amongst the indian states punjab which is an agriculture based economy is pumping the highest volume of gw indus basin aquifer which is rated asthe second most overexploited aquifer in the world lies beneath the state richey et al 2015 national aeronautics and space administration s nasa s gravity recoveryand climate eperiment grace observations have shown that the indus basinaquifer which underlies punjab haryana rajasthan and delhi states of the country is depleting at a rate of 109 km3 year rodell et al 2009 declining gw level in punjab is threatening environmental sustainability by diminishing wetlands reducing base flow to rivers degrading water quality and reducing soil moisture and thus is drying the forest ecology custodio 2002 farmers continue to grow water intensive crops such as paddy and sugarcane due to favourable policy regime of free energy and open ended purchase of these crops at an assured price these consume a large amount of water forirrigation and mainly paddy is the main contributor to the over exploitation of groundwater and the consequent decline in the gw table in the state various strategies to manage the supply and demand of gw can contribute to combat the looming crisis of water scarcity in the region knowledge about the prevailing gw situation in the state and factors affecting its augmentation and efficient use are critical for the future of its agriculture the gw levels usually have a direct bearing on its use to meet the evapotranspiration need of crops particularly in the alluvial formations the present study therefore attempts to quantify the impact of recent initiatives to conserve water on gw depletion in the state to ensure its management for sustainable development 2 study area the punjab state is located between the north latitudes 29 32 and 32 28 and east longitudes 73 50 and 77 00 it occupies a geographical area of 50 362 km2 jammu and kashmir lies in its north and himachal pradesh in the north east the state of haryana lies in the south and rajasthan in southwest the study area shares the boundary with pakistan in the west and with rajasthan and haryana in the south it also constitutes a part of the sutlej sub basin punjab despite being an agricultural economy is a prosperous state of the country based on climate rainfall elevation and soil type the state canbe divided into three distinct physiographic zones and their salient features aresummarized in table 1 the contour lines demarcated based on dem obtained by downloading srtm satellite data neumann et al 2012 have been superimposed on the map showing different zones which indicate that the general slope is from east towest fig 1 2 1 climate the climate of the study area can be described as sub tropical steppe semiarid and hot the state experiences four seasons in the year viz the summer season from april to june the monsoon season from july to mid september and post monsoon season from mid september to november the winter seasonfrom december to march during the cold weather the climate of the state isoccasionally affected by the western disturbances which bring rainfall of the light intensity the state has a well defined rainy period from july to september there is about 90 rainfall during this period due to south west monsoon long dry spells are often experienced necessitating additional irrigation for obtaining high yields dynamic ground water reso 2017 2 2 hydrogeology punjab is a vast plain comprising of alluvial deposits transported by the perennial rivers the sutlej the beas and the ravi quaternary deposits comprise of an alternate sequence of arid and fluvial phases the exposed quaternary sediments can be broadly classified as older alluvium of middle to upper pleistocene age overlain by aeolian deposits of holocene age the provenance of older alluvium deposited by rivers originating from the himalayas and aeolian deposits in the south west part of the area have been laid down by wind action from thar desert of rajasthan dynamic ground water reso 2017 2 3 aquifers according to cgwb lithological data the aquifers consist of extensive granular zones having fine to medium sand with clay intercalations the aquifer composed of very fine to medium sand with silt occurs at a depth below 195m hydraulic conductivity of water bearing formations varies from 5 to 10 m dayin the northern zone to 10 90 m day in the central zone and 4 25 m day in the south western zone of the state the specific yield of aquifers in the state variesfrom 0 08 and 0 17 krishan et al kumar the slope of the water table is towards the west andsouth west which follows land surface slope the hydraulic gradient is steep 3 3 5 0 m km in the northeastern part and reduces to 0 33 m km in the central part in the south west region groundwater elevation contours are widely spaced indicating a slow movement of groundwater the gw flow takes place regularly due to the natural hydraulic gradient yet the upstream aquifer may also have an impact due to the pumping activity taking place downstream ground water year book and 2 2014 2 4 cropping pattern due to various technological advances in crop husbandry and their quick adoption by the progressive farming community punjab agriculture has achieved an incredible enhancement in the productivity and production of crops in the past five decades the area under different crops during different years is given in table 2 which indicates that the rice wheat cropping system has been adopted by the farmers on a large scale statistical abstract of p 2000 statistical abstract of p 2019 the drastic shift in area to rice from other kharif crop has happened as an implication of the policy which favoured and encouraged paddy cultivation due to the food security needs of the country paddy occupies 30 lakh ha area in the summer season out of 41 lakh haunder cultivation in the state and put together the rice wheat cropping system occupies about 85 of the cropped area of the state 2 5 water use in agriculture about 99 of the cultivated area in the state is irrigated and the increase in area under the rice has contributed tremendously to the increase in the irrigation water requirement the number of tubewells which was 0 19 million in 1970 has also increased to 1 47 million in 2019 the total water requirement of the existing cropping pattern has been estimated as 61 675 billion cubic meters bcm against a water availability of only 41 32 bcm i e 17 54 bcm of surface and 23 78 bcm of replenishable gw resource gupta and marwaha the indiscriminate use of gw has led to a situation of declining water table in the state and the stage of gw development has reached 168 most of the development blocksare categorized as over exploited ecological and natural resource issues of rice wheat intensification which are now piling up make it highly precarious to continue the current system stakeholders in the past may not have perceived such issues to be acute enough to warrant a significant change entailing risk as well as extra inputs investments 2 6 recent initiatives for water conservation the state government is seized of the problem of the declining water table but is not in favor of legal regulation of gw use due to the apprehension that such a step will cause hardship to farmers however it has taken the following initiatives during the last decade to tackle over exploitation of groundwater i precision land leveling flood irrigation is the most common method used for irrigating the rice and wheat crops in punjab which leads to a significant loss of water 10 25 due to uneven application of water in uneven fields precision land leveling using laser land levelers contributes to better crop stand due to uniform application of irrigation water and thereby to alower labour requirement and improvement in productivity of crops theuse of laser land levelers was introduced in 2005 and technology was demonstrated on a large scale in 2006 and promoted through providing these machines to farmers co op societies and entrepreneurs on subsidy its adoption contributed to a saving of up to 13 in wheat and up to14 in rice jat et al 2009 more than one million ha has been covered under thistechnology to date ii change in crop calendar the punjab preservation of subsoil water actwas implemented in the state through an ordinance in 2008 and enacted as an act in 2009 which prohibits farmers from sowing nursery of paddy before 10th may and transplanting it before 10th june in a year the primary objective of enacting the act is to save gw by enforcing a change in crop calendar in paddy sowing season from hot and dry periods of may to reduce unproductive evaporation and synchronize it with the onset of monsoon as the evaporation rate during may june is the highest the successful implementation of this act and the consequent change in the crop calendar was estimated to check the fall in the water table by about 30 cm in the first year singh 2009 the crop calendar was further modified by shifting the date of transplanting to 15th june by notification in 2014 20th june in 2018 and 13th june in 2019 iii crop diversification a program for crop diversification away from the rice was launched in the state as a sub scheme under rashtriya krishi vikas yojna with a plan to shift about one million ha under the rice to alternate but less water consuming crops limited progress has been achieved to increase the area under the rice to alternate crops due to better comparative returns from rice on account of low production and marketing risk assured procurement at minimum support price however the area under fruits and vegetables is increasing iv other remedial measures the department of soil and water conservation punjab also laid a renewed emphasis on the implementation of water saving programs progress under major water conservation schemes from 2000 to 2019 is given in table 3 the state government is providing 50 subsidy to individual farmers and 90 for community projects for laying of underground pipeline system to improve on farm water conveyance efficiency in the canal and tubewell commands the average

irrigation facilities to 658 ha area of 14 villages 3 data and methodology the propagation of precision land leveling in 2007 and implementation of punjab preservation of sub soil water act in 2009 through an ordinance in 2008 were two major initiatives for the conservation of irrigation water a period from 2000 to 2019 divided into two intervals i e first from 2000 07 and second from 2010 19 has been selected to assess the effect of these measures on the gw behaviour 3 1 depletion of water table the temporal pre monsoon water level data of observation wells monitored by the department of agriculture and farmers welfare punjab was collected for the period from 2000 to 2019 the data from various points were first consolidated to compute the average depth to the water level for each block and from the block average the district average was calculated district wise water level behaviour for periods 2000 2007 and 2010 2019 was thus analyzed the average water level depletion m in every district was multiplied with their respective ground area m2 and specific yield taken as 12 to estimate the volume of groundwater depleted in the study period and the volume of depletion in each district was worked out the summary of results for the period from 2000 to 2007 and 2010 2019 is given in table 4 the negative sign in the difference field indicates the fall in water level and a positive sign indicates the water level rise however in the volume field the positive sign means the depletion and negative means augmentation of groundwater 3 2 area under different depths to the

data of the year 2000 2007 2010 and 2019 for the premonsoon season was mapped as depicted in fig 2 the area under different depths to gw level was worked out and is given in table 5 3 3 direction of gw flow the flow of gw in the aquifers can be demarcated based on depth to the water level the water level contour maps have been prepared and flow direction has been interpreted from those genet 2017 the identification of recharge and discharge zones of the study area in different seasons can be done based on the water level and flow directions the water level and flow direction maps for the years 2000 and 2019 are given in fig 3 in 2000 fig 3 the gw flow was towards barnala and sangrur districts in the south and jalandhar and sbs nagar districts in the north in 2019 fig 3 the flow was towards moga barnala sangrur patiala and sbs nagar districts in the south and jalandhar and hoshiarpur districts in the north since no major difference in the gw table was observed in the districts like pathankot gurdaspur fazilka and muktsar so these districts are the recharge zones and other districts are the discharge zones in the state punjab 3 4 an assessment of change in the water footprint of rice water footprint assessment for the production of rice in punjab has been worked out as per methodology laid out in the water footprint assessmentmanual hoekstra et al 2011 green water footprint which describes the amount of water used from precipitation green water resources and blue water footprint which stands for the surface and groundwater use for irrigation have been worked out the fao56 pm model allen et al 1998 has been adopted to estimate the reference evapotranspiration eto using cropwat 8 0 software the data regarding the area of rice transplanted on different dates in different years in punjab were collected from the department of agriculture and farmers welfare the weather parameters for ludhiana 30 55 n 75 54 e which has been used to work out the water footprint of rice were collected from punjab agricultural university ludhiana for this study the soil type has been taken as sandy loam as this class dominates central punjab the main rice growing area in the state the average water footprint for rice production is given in table 6 4 results and discussion 4 1 reduction in water use in rice production the implementation of the preservation of sub soil water act 2009 which enforced a change in crop calender i e a shift in paddy growing season from hot and dry months to synchronize it better with the monsoon season had a positive impact on demand for irrigation water for rice the date of transplanting which was initially notified as 10th june in 2008 was shifted to 15th june in 2014 20th june in 2018 and 13th june in 2019 the reduction in the blue water footprint for rice production from 1833 l kg during 2000 07 to 1508 l kgduring 2010 19 table 6 indicates that the use of surface and groundwater for irrigation has come down by 325 l kg or 1305 m3 ha the precision land levelling change in crop calender and other water conservation measures have thus contributed to moderate the rate of depletion of gw in the state 4 2 depletion of water table from the observed pre monsoon water level data of 2000 07 it is observed that there is a considerable fall in the gw level in all districts of punjab except the mukatsar district the highest difference in the gw level was found in the sangrur district where the gw level has depleted up to 9 96 m during 2000 07 and district barnala is a close second with a fall of 8 38 m during this period however the fall in sangrur and barnala districts during 2010 19 was 10 04 and 12 00 m respectively yet due to a continuous increase in the areaunder rice and number of the tubewells for gw pumping the volume of gw depleted during 2000 07 to 2010 19 increased from 22 36 km3 annum to 27 43 km3 annum table 4 from 2000 to 2019 an average fall of about 8 91 m in the gw level has been observed in the whole of punjab the highest depletion of 20 38 m has been recorded in the barnala district during this period the gw depletion continues to be a cause of serious concern as the area of the state having depth to water table more than 10 m has increased from about 30 in 2000 to more than 75 in 2019 table 5 further in more than one fourth area of the state the gw table at present is more than 25 m deep these results support the findings of the earlier studies on this subject dynamic ground water reso 2017 singh 2009 singha singhb baweja et al 2017 the recent initiatives have contributed to arrest the rate of decline of water level despite the increase in the area under paddy as well as the increase in the number of tubewells table 7 4 3 reversal of direction of gw flow the slope of the land surface is towards west and south west and the water table generally follows this slope in 2000 fig 3 the gw flow was towards barnala and sangrur districts in the south and jalandhar and sbs nagar districts in the north subsequently in 2019 the flow was towards moga barnala sangrur patiala and sbs nagar districts in the south and jalandhar and hoshiarpur districts in the north these maps prepared to identify the recharge and discharge zones in the state indicate the development of gw depression cones in areas with high over exploitation thereby creating a local slope to the water table the resulting hydraulic gradient is increasing overtime and has started reversing the flow direction of groundwater such reversals will lead to the flow of saline gw from south western regions to the central region and thus may render the gw in sangrur and moga districts unfit for irrigation 5 conclusion since prehistoric times gw has been a vital resource for irrigation that people have relied on gw accounts for irrigation of 73 percent of the irrigated area under agriculture in the state and the rice cultivation has thrived here in the past due to an easy access to groundwater and the free supply of electricity the recent initiatives by the state for the conservation of water have contributed to reduce the consumptive use of irrigation water for rice by 325 l kg of rice production i e from 1833 l kg during 2000 2007 to 1508 l kg of other water conservation measures have thus been helpful to check the rate of decline of water level despite the increase in area under of paddy as well as an increase in the number of tubewells the consequent spatial and temporal changes in groundwater behaviour bring out that rapid gw depletion poses a grave threat to its availability and recent initiatives are not sufficient for making gw use for agriculture sustainable the over exploitation is not only increasing the groundwater scarcity but is also contributing to the development of depression cones in the central zone which may turn it increasingly unfit for irrigation due to the reversal of direction of flow from a south west zone which is underlain with brackish gw the prediction of increased but highly variable rainfall events and increased surface temperatures by climate models is likely to aggravate the existing precarious gw situation further to ameliorate the current depleting gw scenario there is a dire need to reform the policy of free power to agriculture to make water an economic good it is also essential to augment groundwater supplies through rainwater harvesting and artificial recharge to reduce water use inirrigated agriculture remedial measures such as soil mulching which reduces unproductive evaporation promotion of micro irrigation which maximizes the water use efficiency deficit irrigation which improves water productivity conservation tillage which improves water holding capacity and other soil properties cultivation of drought resistant crop varieties and crop diversification which augment resilience to shortage of irrigation water should form an integral part of the policy to check the depletion of

12014,groundwater gw is a vital source of water supply for drinking irrigation and industry in most parts of india in punjab the adoption of the rice wheat cropping system has led to a manifold increase in the irrigation water demand and about 73 of it is met from gw consequently the gw level in the state is declining rapidly due to its overuse and misuse to conserve irrigation water the government has recently taken some initiatives including enacting the preservation of sub soil water act 2009 which prohibits early transplanting of rice for reducing unproductive evaporation and thereby the irrigation demand this paper attempts to assess the impact of such measures on the gw depletion between the year 2000 and 2019 during this period the average gw depletion in punjab is about 8 91 m with the highest depletion of about 20 38 m in barnala district the depth to the water table maps indicate that the area of the state having depth to water table more than 10 m has increased from about 30 in 2000 to more than 75 in 2019 the water table elevation maps show the development of gw depression cones in areas with excessive over exploitation and thereby a likely reversal in the direction of gw flow the time is fast approaching when the state shall have to undertake comprehensive water budgeting and appropriate policy initiatives to address the concerns of the depleting gw trend graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater level flow direction depletion recent initiatives water footprint 1 introduction the combined effect of climate change erratic monsoon and the growing population of india is contributing to an increasing dependence of the population on gw siebert et al 2010 consequently the groundwater resources are depleting at analarming rate throughout the country ground water year book and 2 2014 bonsor et al 2017 krishan et al kumar macdonald et al gopalet al macdonald et al 2016 amongst the indian states punjab which is an agriculture based economy is pumping the highest volume of gw indus basin aquifer which is rated asthe second most overexploited aquifer in the world lies beneath the state richey et al 2015 national aeronautics and space administration s nasa s gravity recoveryand climate eperiment grace observations have shown that the indus basinaquifer which underlies punjab haryana rajasthan and delhi states of the country is depleting at a rate of 109 km3 year rodell et al 2009 declining gw level in punjab is threatening environmental sustainability by diminishing wetlands reducing base flow to rivers degrading water quality and reducing soil moisture and thus is drying the forest ecology custodio 2002 farmers continue to grow water intensive crops such as paddy and sugarcane due to favourable policy regime of free energy and open ended purchase of these crops at an assured price these consume a large amount of water forirrigation and mainly paddy is the main contributor to the over exploitation of groundwater and the consequent decline in the gw table in the state various strategies to manage the supply and demand of gw can contribute to combat the looming crisis of water scarcity in the region knowledge about the prevailing gw situation in the state and factors affecting its augmentation and efficient use are critical for the future of its agriculture the gw levels usually have a direct bearing on its use to meet the evapotranspiration need of crops particularly in the alluvial formations the present study therefore attempts to quantify the impact of recent initiatives to conserve water on gw depletion in the state to ensure its management for sustainable development 2 study area the punjab state is located between the north latitudes 29 32 and 32 28 and east longitudes 73 50 and 77 00 it occupies a geographical area of 50 362 km2 jammu and kashmir lies in its north and himachal pradesh in the north east the state of haryana lies in the south and rajasthan in southwest the study area shares the boundary with pakistan in the west and with rajasthan and haryana in the south it also constitutes a part of the sutlej sub basin punjab despite being an agricultural economy is a prosperous state of the country based on climate rainfall elevation and soil type the state canbe divided into three distinct physiographic zones and their salient features aresummarized in table 1 the contour lines demarcated based on dem obtained by downloading srtm satellite data neumann et al 2012 have been superimposed on the map showing different zones which indicate that the general slope is from east towest fig 1 2 1 climate the climate of the study area can be described as sub tropical steppe semiarid and hot the state experiences four seasons in the year viz the summer season from april to june the monsoon season from july to mid september and post monsoon season from mid september to november the winter seasonfrom december to march during the cold weather the climate of the state isoccasionally affected by the western disturbances which bring rainfall of the light intensity the state has a well defined rainy period from july to september there is about 90 rainfall during this period due to south west monsoon long dry spells are often experienced necessitating additional irrigation for obtaining high yields dynamic ground water reso 2017 2 2 hydrogeology punjab is a vast plain comprising of alluvial deposits transported by the perennial rivers the sutlej the beas and the ravi quaternary deposits comprise of an alternate sequence of arid and fluvial phases the exposed quaternary sediments can be broadly classified as older alluvium of middle to upper pleistocene age overlain by aeolian deposits of holocene age the provenance of older alluvium deposited by rivers originating from the himalayas and aeolian deposits in the south west part of the area have been laid down by wind action from thar desert of rajasthan dynamic ground water reso 2017 2 3 aquifers according to cgwb lithological data the aquifers consist of extensive granular zones having fine to medium sand with clay intercalations the aquifer composed of very fine to medium sand with silt occurs at a depth below 195m hydraulic conductivity of water bearing formations varies from 5 to 10 m dayin the northern zone to 10 90 m day in the central zone and 4 25 m day in the south western zone of the state the specific yield of aquifers in the state variesfrom 0 08 and 0 17 krishan et al kumar the slope of the water table is towards the west andsouth west which follows land surface slope the hydraulic gradient is steep 3 3 5 0 m km in the northeastern part and reduces to 0 33 m km in the central part in the south west region groundwater elevation contours are widely spaced indicating a slow movement of groundwater the gw flow takes place regularly due to the natural hydraulic gradient yet the upstream aquifer may also have an impact due to the pumping activity taking place downstream ground water year book and 2 2014 2 4 cropping pattern due to various technological advances in crop husbandry and their quick adoption by the progressive farming community punjab agriculture has achieved an incredible enhancement in the productivity and production of crops in the past five decades the area under different crops during different years is given in table 2 which indicates that the rice wheat cropping system has been adopted by the farmers on a large scale statistical abstract of p 2000 statistical abstract of p 2019 the drastic shift in area to rice from other kharif crop has happened as an implication of the policy which favoured and encouraged paddy cultivation due to the food security needs of the country paddy occupies 30 lakh ha area in the summer season out of 41 lakh haunder cultivation in the state and put together the rice wheat cropping system occupies about 85 of the cropped area of the state 2 5 water use in agriculture about 99 of the cultivated area in the state is irrigated and the increase in area under the rice has contributed tremendously to the increase in the irrigation water requirement the number of tubewells which was 0 19 million in 1970 has also increased to 1 47 million in 2019 the total water requirement of the existing cropping pattern has been estimated as 61 675 billion cubic meters bcm against a water availability of only 41 32 bcm i e 17 54 bcm of surface and 23 78 bcm of replenishable gw resource gupta and marwaha the indiscriminate use of gw has led to a situation of declining water table in the state and the stage of gw development has reached 168 most of the development blocksare categorized as over exploited ecological and natural resource issues of rice wheat intensification which are now piling up make it highly precarious to continue the current system stakeholders in the past may not have perceived such issues to be acute enough to warrant a significant change entailing risk as well as extra inputs investments 2 6 recent initiatives for water conservation the state government is seized of the problem of the declining water table but is not in favor of legal regulation of gw use due to the apprehension that such a step will cause hardship to farmers however it has taken the following initiatives during the last decade to tackle over exploitation of groundwater i precision land leveling flood irrigation is the most common method used for irrigating the rice and wheat crops in punjab which leads to a significant loss of water 10 25 due to uneven application of water in uneven fields precision land leveling using laser land levelers contributes to better crop stand due to uniform application of irrigation water and thereby to alower labour requirement and improvement in productivity of crops theuse of laser land levelers was introduced in 2005 and technology was demonstrated on a large scale in 2006 and promoted through providing these machines to farmers co op societies and entrepreneurs on subsidy its adoption contributed to a saving of up to 13 in wheat and up to14 in rice jat et al 2009 more than one million ha has been covered under thistechnology to date ii change in crop calendar the punjab preservation of subsoil water actwas implemented in the state through an ordinance in 2008 and enacted as an act in 2009 which prohibits farmers from sowing nursery of paddy before 10th may and transplanting it before 10th june in a year the primary objective of enacting the act is to save gw by enforcing a change in crop calendar in paddy sowing season from hot and dry periods of may to reduce unproductive evaporation and synchronize it with the onset of monsoon as the evaporation rate during may june is the highest the successful implementation of this act and the consequent change in the crop calendar was estimated to check the fall in the water table by about 30 cm in the first year singh 2009 the crop calendar was further modified by shifting the date of transplanting to 15th june by notification in 2014 20th june in 2018 and 13th june in 2019 iii crop diversification a program for crop diversification away from the rice was launched in the state as a sub scheme under rashtriya krishi vikas yojna with a plan to shift about one million ha under the rice to alternate but less water consuming crops limited progress has been achieved to increase the area under the rice to alternate crops due to better comparative returns from rice on account of low production and marketing risk assured procurement at minimum support price however the area under fruits and vegetables is increasing iv other remedial measures the department of soil and water conservation punjab also laid a renewed emphasis on the implementation of water saving programs progress under major water conservation schemes from 2000 to 2019 is given in table 3 the state government is providing 50 subsidy to individual farmers and 90 for community projects for laying of underground pipeline system to improve on farm water conveyance efficiency in the canal and tubewell commands the average length of the underground pipeline laid annually during 2008 19 is about 4250 km against an average of about 17 km per annum during 2000 2008 micro irrigation is being propagated particularly for vegetables and orchards in a mission mode by providing subsidy 80 of capital cost the farmers adopting drip and sprinkler irrigation systems are being provided electric connections for their tubewells on priority an area of more than 28 000 ha has been covered under micro irrigation during 2008 19 423 rainwater harvesting cum recharging structures have been constructed in the kandiarea during this period a new scheme for recycling the treated sullage water for irrigation has been launched and an underground pipeline system has been installed on each of 37 sewage treatment plants for supplying and distribution of the treated water for irrigation to more than 5250 ha astand alone solar powered lift cum micro irrigation project has been executed in the hoshiarpur district to provide irrigation facilities to 658 ha area of 14 villages 3 data and methodology the propagation of precision land leveling in 2007 and implementation of punjab preservation of sub soil water act in 2009
