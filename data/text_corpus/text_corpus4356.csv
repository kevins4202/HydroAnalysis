21780,the net buoyancy driving force of underwater gliders decreases gradually when the gliders dive or climb in the seawater which increases the energy consumption and reduces the gliding range the neutrally buoyant hull is an effective measure to reduce this buoyancy loss of underwater gliders in this paper a multiple intersecting spheres mis pressure hull is designed to provide neutral buoyancy a mechanical model of the hull is established with the thin shell theory based on which the optimization is carried out by combining the penalty function method pfm and multiple population genetic algorithm mpga thickness of the spherical shell reinforcing rib width of the reinforcing rib and intersection angle of the spherical shell are optimized for minimizing the buoyancy factor which is defined as the ratio of pressure hull mass to the undeformed displacement additionally the mechanical model is verified by the finite element analysis and the pressure test the results show that the mis pressure hull can increase the buoyancy compensation by 69 69 and increase battery capacity of the glider by 12 89 as compared with conventional cylindrical hull this will improve the navigation range and duration of petrel l glider more obviously when its hotel load is lower keywords auv multiple intersecting sphere neutrally buoyant hull optimization design underwater glider 1 introduction underwater gliders are one of the most promising autonomous underwater vehicles auv for long term ocean observations which have attracted much attention and been studied extensively griffiths et al 2007 since firstly conceptualized by stommel 1989 underwater gliders have been developed worldwide some underwater gliders such as the slocum webb et al 2001 the seaglider eriksen et al 2001 and the spray sherman et al 2001 have already been adopted in the ocean phenomena observation for their efficient long distance and long duration ability most underwater gliders need to operate for long duration and distance and therefore the method of saving energy and the efficient designs are necessary driven by the net buoyancy the underwater glider can dive and climb in the seawater by attaining positive and negative buoyancy eriksen et al 2001 during which its volume compressibility defined as the unit volume variation caused by the unit pressure variation is regarded as a constant the buoyancy change of the glider is mainly dependent on the physical parameters and the hull deformation yang et al 2017 due to compressibility and volumetric thermal expansion of the glider the changes of pressure density and temperature with depth cause variations in the glider s buoyancy however salinity and other factors have less influence osse and eriksen 2007 frajka williams et al 2011 for a glider with conventional hull when it ascends higher in the seawater column and the pressure relaxes it becomes less buoyant because the hull is less compressible than seawater in particular the buoyancy further changes when the glider goes through the thermocline in which the seawater density decreases faster especially at low attitudes jenkins et al 2003 this phenomenon can be found in fig 1 yang et al 2019 which shows the buoyancy loss of the conventional cylindrical hull of the chinese petrel glider consequently in order to maintain the net buoyancy necessary to return to the sea surface or reach the target depth the buoyancy engine has to consume extra energy to create an additional increment of oil volume however a hull slightly more compressible than seawater gives the minimum pump energy expenditure as it somewhat compensates for the higher density below the thermocline jenkins et al 2003 graver and grady 2005 therefore the neutrally buoyant hull the compressibility of which matches that of the seawater is effective to reduce the energy consumption of the buoyancy engine for underwater gliders davis et al 2002 jenkins et al 2003 the problem of neutrally buoyant technology has received considerable attention for several decades and resulted in numerous studies the early research of which mainly focused on the floats the neutrally buoyant float used to measure subsurface ocean currents was developed simultaneously and independently in the mid 1950s by bowden 1954 in the usa and by swallow 1955 in the uk which has been a vital tool in the exploration of the global ocean circulation and provides a central element of the in situ ocean observation system through the argo project gould 2005 introduced the development of neutrally buoyant floats from their origins in the mid 1950s to 2004 rossby et al 1985 firstly attempted to make floats more lagrangian by modifying their compressibility using a spring back piston however in the aspect of the neutrally buoyant hull simple cylindrical hulls with a large enough compressibility will fail at the design pressure and one solution is to use ring stiffened cylindrical hulls which have reinforcing ribs placed periodically along the hull to prevent buckling thus the mis hull involving a series of spheres reinforced at the intersections by ribs is gradually applied as a neutrally buoyant hull on the floats and underwater gliders d asaro 2003 introduced a deep lagrangian float hull including a series of ribs connected by cylindrical arched bays designed by a combination of numerical modeling and destructive testing the compressibility of which matches that of the seawater to the depth of 2000 m the similar improvements have been realized by a 6061t6 hull of similar design applied on the seaglider eriksen et al 2001 griffiths et al 2007 which is widely applied in the marine observation some works have been developed in designing the pressure hull reinforced by ribs garland 1968 studied the design and fabrication of deep quest and deep submergence rescue vehicle leon 1971 experimental studied an experimental investigation of intersecting titanium spheres hall et al 1991 designed a composite spherical hull reinforced by titanium alloy rings to reduce the mass of the hull liang et al 2004 investigated the optimization of a mis deep submerged pressure hull gou and cui 2009 studied the problem of structural optimization for multiple intersecting spherical pressure hulls based on kriging model tang et al 2018 applied the bi directional evolutionary structural optimization beso method to the optimization of a ring stiffened cylindrical hull for a neutrally buoyant underwater glider zhang et al 2017 analyzed the numerical and experimental results of buckling of bi segment spherical shells with reinforcing rib of different size du et al 2015 established a whole welding steel toroidal model with ring stiffened ribs and studied by nonlinear fe method wang and guo 2016 presented a semi analytical method to analysis the vibration response of submerged stiffened combined shells xie et al 2015 presented an analytic approach to analyze free and forced vibration of submerged ring stiffened conical shell with arbitrary boundary conditions at low frequencies foryś 2015 introduced an optimization of a simply supported cylindrical shell stiffened by inner ribs under external pressure although some researches about designing and optimizing the mis pressure hull have been reported the mechanical model of mis pressure hull in previous works is simplified meanwhile very few works about deducing exact deformation and stresses of the mis pressure hull have been reported because of the lack of theoretical formulas which need to be considered in the optimization of the neutrally buoyant pressure hull for underwater gliders moreover there are few reports analyzing the effect of the neutrally buoyant pressure hull applied on the underwater gliders in this paper an efficient method is developed to optimize the mis neutrally buoyant hull for underwater gliders the main contributions of this paper are in two aspects 1 an analytical model of mis pressure hull subject to external pressure is established by thin shell theory which is then employed in an optimization framework to reduce the buoyancy factor 2 the effect of the mis neutrally buoyant hull on the gliding range of the underwater gliders is analyzed quantitatively in comparison with the conventional cylindrical hull accordingly this study presents an optimization design of the mis neutrally buoyant hull the optimization established based on the theory of the thin shell including the membrane theory and moment theory aims to minimize the buoyancy factor design variables in the optimization model include the thickness of the spherical shell the thickness of the reinforcing rib the width of the reinforcing rib and the angle of the intersection of the spherical shells some constraints are considered in this paper including the compressibility constraint of the pressure hull the stress constraints the stability constraints and the side constraints of the design variables an optimization procedure is implemented to solve this nonlinear constrained optimization problem the finite element analysis and the pressure test are implemented to verify the validity of the optimization result finally the application of the neutrally buoyant pressure hull on the underwater glider is analyzed quantitatively 2 mechanical modeling 2 1 mis configuration the mis pressure hull involves a series of spherical shells reinforced at their intersections by reinforcing ribs as shown in fig 2 a the shell thickness of the spherical shells t the shell middle surface radius r the shell intersection angle ϕ 0 the reinforcing rib width b and the reinforcing rib height h are defined in fig 2 b the reinforcing ribs can prevent buckling of the hull and the spherical shells transfer the pressure forces acting on the hull to the ribs while maintaining a nearly constant stress within the material which makes the mis pressure hull strong compressible and very light d asaro 2003 in addition the structure of the reinforcing ribs allow a larger access path between spherical shells which increases the space utilization of the entire mis pressure hull liang et al 2004 2 2 mechanical modeling a mis pressure hull is subjected to hydraulic pressure on the spherical shells and the two end closure bulkheads when analyzing this type of structure in the engineering field the membrane theory is firstly applied to solve membrane forces to get an approximate solution and then the marginal moments are analyzed by the moment theory finally a complete solution is obtained by combining them together under some boundary conditions timoshenko and woinowsky krieger 1959 2 2 1 the spherical shell the forces applied on the spherical shell are illustrated by fig 3 which includes the axial internal force q the radial internal force h the moment m and the external hydrostatic pressure p the axial internal force q can be expressed by eq 1 1 q p π r t 2 2 2 π r sin ϕ 0 2 2 1 1 analysis with the membrane theory the membrane theory is widely applied in analyzing the elastic thin shells which plays an important role in the shell theory when the membrane theory is adopted the marginal shear forces and the marginal moments are ignored because of their edge effect therefore the free body diagram can be given as shown in fig 4 the equilibrium equations physical equations and geometric equations of rotational symmetric spherical shell in the spherical coordinate frame timoshenko and woinowsky krieger 1959 are shown in the following eqs 2 4 2 n ϕ ϕ n ϕ θ θ n θ cos ϕ p 1 r 0 n ϕ θ ϕ n θ θ n ϕ θ cos ϕ p 2 r 0 n ϕ r n θ r p 3 0 where n ϕ n θ and n ϕθ are the membrane forces per unit length in the main normal section ϕ and θ are the latitudinal and

of the spherical shell according to the stress state in fig 3 the final solution of the equilibrium equations is 6 n ϕ q sin ϕ 0 h cos ϕ 0 sin 2 ϕ p r sin 2 ϕ sin 2 ϕ 0 2 sin 2 ϕ n θ q sin ϕ 0 h cos ϕ

utilizing the boundary condition u s1 π 2 0 finally u s1 and w s1 can be solved the expression of which are complex 2 2 1 2 analysis with the moment theory in fact the situation that the thin shells merely bear membrane stress is impossible because of the shearing forces and the moments imposed on the edge of the shells hence the moment theory analysis of the thin shell is necessary the free body diagram in the moment theory analysis is shown in fig 5 using the moment theory timoshenko and woinowsky krieger 1959 analyzed the rotational symmetry spherical shell without opening in which only the first solution of the hypergeometric equation 10 was involved however the second solution is utilized in the analysis of the spherical shell with axisymmetric opening 10 d 2 q ϕ d ϕ 2 cot ϕ d q ϕ d ϕ

and the solution can be solved 11 q ϕ 1 r a 1 z 1 a 2 z 2 here a 1 and a 2 are the constants which can be solved by the boundary condition of the opening and the expressions of z 1 and z 2 are shown in eq 12 and eq 13 12 z 1 sin ϕ cos ϕ 5 cos 3 ϕ 3 95 4 ρ 2 cos 5 ϕ 5 3895 260 ρ 4 cos 7 ϕ 7 13 z 2 sin ϕ ρ 2 cos 3 ϕ 3 2 ρ 2 cos 5 ϕ 5 1079 ρ 2 4 ρ 6 cos 7 ϕ 2520 10063 ρ 2 68 ρ 6 cos 9 ϕ 22680 where ρ is defined in eq 14 14 ρ 2 3 r 2 1 μ 2 t 2 μ 2 4 the internal forces n ϕ and n θ can be calculated as shown by eq 15 15 n ϕ q ϕ cot ϕ n θ d q ϕ d ϕ the angle of rotation v s on the edge of the spherical shell is shown by eq 16 16 v s μ a 1 2 a 2 ρ 2 e t r z 1 μ a 2 2 a 1 ρ 2 e t r z 2 the moments m sϕ and m sθ can be calculated by eq 17 17 m sϕ e t 3 12 1 μ 2 1 r d v s d ϕ μ cot ϕ r v s m s

reinforcing rib the axial force q is ignored because of its negligible impact on the short cylinder shell therefore the forces applied on the cylinder shell are illustrated by fig 6 including the radial internal force h the moment of force m and the external hydrostatic pressure p 2 2 2 1 analysis with the membrane theory the reinforcing rib can be regarded as a thick walled cylinder shell and the deflection of the reinforcing rib at the intersection of the shell is 21 w c 1 2 h r sin ϕ 0 e b 1 c 2 1 c 2 μ where c is the ratio of the inner diameter to the external diameter 22 c r sin ϕ 0 h r sin ϕ 0 2 2 2 2 analysis with the moment theory when analyzing the symmetric cylindrical shell with bending theory the radial displacement can be expressed as follows with hyperbolic functions 23 w c 2 c 3 sin 3 1 μ 2 r sin ϕ 0 h 2 1 4 x s h 3 1 μ 2 r sin ϕ 0 h 2 1 4 x c 4 cos 3 1 μ 2 r sin ϕ 0 h 2 1 4 x c h 3 1 μ 2 4 r sin ϕ 0 h 2 1 4 x where c 3 and c 4 are the integration constants the moment m c and shearing q c can be calculated by eq 23 as shown in eq 24 24 m c e h 3 12 1 μ 2 d 2 w c 2 d x 2 q c e h 3 12 1 μ 2 d 3 w c 2 d x 3 and the constants c 1 and c 2 can be calculated by the boundary conditions shown in eq 25 25 m c x b 2 m q c x b 2 0 furthermore the intersection angle on the edge of the rib is 26 v 2 d δ r 2 d x x b 2 2 2 3 compatibility of deformation to keep compatibility of deformation the deflection and deformation of the spherical shell are accordingly equal to those of the reinforcing rib therefore the moment m and internal force h can be solved by eq 27 27 w s 1 w s 2 sin ϕ 0 u s 1 u s 2 cos ϕ 0 w c 1 w c 2 x b 2 v s v c 2 3 some parameters of the hull some parameters of the hull referred to in the following optimization are shown as follows 2 3 1 buoyancy factor the buoyancy factor is selected as the objective function in the conventional hull structure design defined as the radio of the hull weight to displaced water volume the hull mass m hull of the mis neutrally buoyant hull is shown in eq 28 28 m hull 2 n r cos ϕ 0 π r t 2 2 r t 2 2 ρ m π n 2 h r sin ϕ 0 h 2 b ρ m where n is the segment number of the spherical shell and ρ m is the density of the shell material and the hull volume v 0 under normal atmospheric pressure is expressed by eq 29 29 v 0 n ρ w ϕ 0 ϕ π r t 2 sin ϕ 3 d ϕ π r t 2 sin ϕ 0 2 b here ρ w is the density of the water therefore the buoyancy factor f can be calculated by eqs 28 and 29 30 f m hull ρ w v 0 2 3 2 space utilization in this study the inner space utilization rate is considered in the optimization of the pressure hull defined as the ratio of the inner useable volume to the total volume of the hull the space utilization r s is shown by eq 31 31 r s n π r sin ϕ 0 2 b 2 r cos ϕ 0 v 0 2 3 3 compressibility the deformation of the hull under the hydrostatic pressure p can be divided into three portions the circumferential volume change of the spherical shells v p1 the circumferential volume change of the reinforcing ribs v p2 and the axial volume change of the spherical shells v p3 which are expressed by eq 32 eq 33 and eq 34 32 v p 1 n ϕ 0 ϕ π r t 2 sin ϕ w s sin ϕ 0 u s cos ϕ 0 3 d ϕ 33 v p 2 2 n 0 b 2 π r t 2 sin ϕ 0 w c 1 w c 2 2 34 v p 3 n π r t 2 2 1 sin ϕ 0 2 2 w s cos ϕ 0 u s sin ϕ 0 thus the total volume change of the mis hull v p can be calculated as shown in eq 35 35 v p v p 1 v p 2 v p 3 the coefficient of volume compressibility k can be calculated by its definition shown as follows 36 k v p v 0 v p p when considering the net buoyancy loss the influence of the temperature on the hull volume is ignored which is insignificant compared to the pressure influence therefore the net buoyancy loss in the diving phase can be expressed as follows 37 δ b ρ sw h g v 0 1 k p δ p δ ρ s w ρ s w δ p k here δb is the net buoyancy loss of the pressure hull ρ sw is the seawater density changing with the depth δp is the pressure difference and δρ sw is the density difference to minimize δb the compressibility of the hull k should be close to the expression δρ sw ρ sw δp which is nonlinear as illustrated by fig 7 it can be seen from fig 7 that the compressibility of the seawater varies approximately linearly with depth below the depth of 300 m as the glider volume variation is linear it is possible that the glider hull can compensate for the buoyancy loss after 300 m tang et al 2018 fig 7 a shows the seawater density in south china sea and fig 7 b is the compressibility of seawater calculated by seawater density in this paper the compressibility k is 0 59 10 9 1 pa by calculating the average value from the depth of 300 m to the depth of 1000 m shown by the imaginary line in fig 7 b 2 3 4 stress if the distance between the ribs is small enough the hull fails when the stress in the arches exceeds the strength of the material rather than by buckling this is desirable because material failure unlike buckling is easy to model and predict d asaro 2003 therefore in order to avoid material failure the stresses need to be analyzed in particular 2 3 4 1 stresses of the spherical shell based on the mechanical analytical model of the hull the latitudinal tangential stress on the external surface of the spherical shell σ ϕ1 the latitudinal tangential stress on the internal surface of the spherical shell σ ϕ2 the longitudinal tangential stress on the external surface of the spherical shell σ θ1 and the longitudinal tangential stress on internal surface of the spherical shell σ θ2 are deduced by eq 6 and eq 17 38 σ ϕ 1 n ϕ t 6 m sϕ t 2 39 σ ϕ 2 n ϕ t 6 m sϕ t 2 40 σ θ 1 n θ t 6 m s θ t 2 41 σ θ 2 n θ t 6 m s θ t 2 2 3 4 2 stress of the reinforcing rib the stress on the reinforcing rib at its inner radius is 42 σ r 2 2 h b p 1 c 2 2 3 5 stability the instability of the hull is herein considered to prevent the buckling failure the failure forms of the mis pressure hull including the local instability and the general instability are decided by its structural size the schematic diagrams of which are shown in fig 8 when the stiffness of the reinforcing ribs is larger than that of the spherical shells the local instability occurs with the increase of the uniform external pressure in which the spherical shells transform into a half wave between the neighbouring rigid ribs contrariwise the general instability occurs in which the entire mis pressure hull transforms into a half wave and only the edges of the hull keep rigid as presented by nash nash 1995 the empirical expression for hydrostatic buckling pressure p crl of mis pressure hull is 43 p crl 1 0 175 70 0 ϕ 0 20 0 1 0 7 r 400 t 0 3 e t 2 r 2 as for the general instability of the mis pressure hull there is not yet an accurate expression however there exists the standard formulation of the general instability of the stiffened cylindrical hull the construction of which is similar to that of the mis pressure hull thus the general instability of mis pressure hull is obtained by modifying the general instability of a stiffened cylindrical shell similarly liang et al 2004 adopted this approximation method when optimizing the mis pressure hull therefore the effective general instability of the mis pressure is considered herein based on the general instability of the stiffened cylindrical shell developed by kendrick and modified by bryant comstock 1967 accordingly the expression for the critical general buckling pressure of mis pressure hull with multiple intersecting spheres p cr is 44 p cr e t r e m 4 n m 2 m 2 2 1 n m 2 m 2 2 n m 2 1 e i r e 2 l s where r e r 2 1 sin ϕ 0 l s 2 r cos ϕ 0 m π r e l l n l s i h b t 2 h 2 2 1 h b l s t b h 3 12 l s t 3 12 i is the inertia moment of the frame l is the total length

surface radius of the shell r the material properties of the shell and the max operational pressure p in this paper the aluminium alloy of 7075t6 is used in the design of the hull because of its low density high strength and low modulus of elasticity the material properties and other pre assigned design parameters are described as follows 1 radius of the sphere shell middle surface r 125 mm 2

6 3 optimization formulation the optimizer is designed to achieve the minimum buoyancy factor the optimal design is mathematically modeled as follows 3 1 design variables in this paper as described in fig 1 b the thickness of the spherical shell t the angle of the shell intersection ϕ 0 the width of the reinforcing ribs b and the height of the reinforcing ribs h are taken as the design variables in the optimization design 3 2 objective function in this paper the research focuses on the influence of the pressure hull design on the gliding range of the glider which shows in two aspects 1 the pressure hull with smaller buoyancy factor can provide more buoyancy to accommodate batteries 2 the compressibility of the pressure hull which matches that of the seawater can reduce the buoyancy loss of the glider the former is ensured by the objective function and the latter is ensured by the deformation constraint therefore the displacement of pressure hull is basically a constant and the mass is optimized to be minimum in this paper however for the situation of certain payload additional volume would be more desirable thus the objective of the optimization design is to minimize the buoyancy factor the objective function f is 45 f f 3 3 constraint conditions to ensure the reliability of the structure some constraint conditions must be satisfied as described below 3 3 1 strength constraints the intersection of the spherical shell and the reinforcing rib is the most dangerous region because of stress concentration hence according to the third strength theory the strength constraints can be expressed as follows 46 g 1 0 85 σ s σ ϕ 1 ϕ π 2 0 47 g 2 0 85 σ s σ ϕ 2 ϕ π 2 0 48 g 3 1 15 σ s σ θ 1 ϕ ϕ 0 0 49 g 4 1 15 σ s σ θ 2 ϕ ϕ 0 0 50 g 5 0 6 σ s σ r 0 3 3 2 stability constraints in order to avoid buckling in the spherical shell the shell lobar buckling constraints can be expressed as follows 51 g 6 p crl 1 5 p 0 52 g 7 p cr 1 5 p 0 3 3 3 space utilization constraint because of the existence of reinforcing ribs the space utilization of the mis pressure hull is lower than that of the conventional cylindrical shell therefore the space utilization constraint is necessary for the optimization of the mis pressure hull 53 g 8 r s 0 7 0 3 3 4 deformation constraint in order to make the pressure hull neutrally buoyant the compressibility of the mis pressure hull needs to satisfy the following equality constraint 54 h 1 k 0 59 10 9 0 3 3 5 side constraints in addition each design variable needs to have a feasible region in which the optimum value can be obtained the value ranges of the design variables need to be large enough to ensure the validity of the optimization results the maximum value of the thickness of the spherical shell is decided empirically while the intersection angle of the shell is influenced by the space utilization constraint in addition the maximum values of the height and the width of the reinforcing rib are decided by the geometric construction of the mis pressure hull thus the value ranges of the design variables are large enough and the optimization results are within the side constraints the side constraint of the thickness of the spherical shell is 55 0 1 t 6 the side constraint of the intersection angle of the shell is 56 60 o ϕ 0 75 o the side constraint of the height of the reinforcing rib is 57 0 h r sin ϕ 0 the side constraint of the width of the reinforcing rib is 58 0 b 2 r cos ϕ 0 3 4 solution algorithm in this paper the optimal design problem of mis pressure hull is a nonlinear constrained optimization problem concerning the equality constraint and the inequality constraints thus in order to make it convenient to solve this problem the pfm algorithm is employed to transform the constrained optimization into an unconstrained one therefore the fitness values of the points violating the constraints in the population of each iteration are obviously larger than those of the points satisfying the constraints because of the penalty function thus these points are discarded in each iteration and there are no better minima being discarded due to constraint violation the expression of the transformed mixed penalty function is 59 φ x r k f x r v 1 q h v 2 x g 1 m x 0 f x s u 1 m g u 2 x r v 1 q h v 2 x e l s e where ϕ x r k is the augmented objective function f x is the objective function x is the vector of design variables g u x is the inequality constraint h v x is the equality constraint r r 1 1014 and s s 1 are the penalty factor of equality constraints and inequality constraints respectively m is the number of the inequality constraints and q is the number of the equality constraints however owing to the complexity of solving the mechanical model in section 2 2 it is difficult to directly obtain the explicit analytical expression of the moment m and internal force h expressed by the design variables some optimization algorithms based on the explicit analytical expression such as newton method and gradient method can t solve this problem thus the standard genetic algorithm sga whitley 1994 reeves and rowe 2005 without the limitation of the function derivative has strong robustness and powerful ability of global search which is efficient to solve the optimization problem in this paper however when the sga is adopted to solve the optimization different results are obtained in each optimization and the problems of local optimization and premature constringency appear to avoid these problems the mpga method alshraideh et al 2011 applying collaborative optimization of multiple populations with different control parameters is adopted to solve the optimization now an integrated mathematic model of the optimization design has been established and the mpga toolbox is used to seek the optimal solution in the matlab software the program chart is shown in fig 9 and the steps of the optimization are as follows 1 input the mechanical model of the mis pressure hull established in section 2 and establish the augmented objective function eq 59 as the fitness function by combining the objective function and the constraints using the pfm algorithm 2 generate the initial populations in which the individual number is 40 and the population number is 10 3 calculate the fitness values and set nn 1 4 if the fitness values meets the requirement that the optimal fitness value is uniform in continuous 30 iterations or n t t 50 output the optimization result if not update the populations by the mpga algorithm and return to step 3 until the requirement in step 4 is met 4 optimization result in the mpga algorithm the control parameters of each population including the crossover operator and mutation operator are set to be different in order to ensure the global search capability and local search capability the values of which are selected randomly from the ranges of 0 7 0 9 and 0 001 0 05 respectively as shown in fig 10 fig 11 shows the optimization results and the ruleless trend of the design variables fig 12 shows the optimal fitness value of each generation from which the convergence process of the optimization can be seen table 1 shows the optimization result of the fitness value and design variables 5 finite element analysis and pressure test 5 1 finite element analysis to validate the correctness of the optimization the finite element analysis shown in fig 13 is performed in the ansys workbench software based on the optimization result in which the displacements and stresses are contrasted with the analytical solution fig 14 shows the longitudinal displacement comparison and lateral displacement comparison of the spherical shell from which it can be seen that the longitudinal displacement at the intersection of the spherical shell is larger than that in the middle of the spherical shell and that the lateral displacement of the spherical shell varies substantially linearly with the angle moreover it can be seen that the trends of the displacements in the analytical solution are substantially same as those in the numerical solution the errors in table 2 are negligible and thus the compressibility of the mis pressure hull in the optimization is ensured fig 15 show the stress comparison of the pressure hull and it can be seen that the stress variation trend in the numerical solution is substantially consistent with that in the analytical solution however the difference values of the stresses in the intersection of the spherical shells ϕ 75 are a little larger than those in the middle of the spherical shells ϕ 90 5 2 pressure test in order to further verify the optimization result the model of the optimized pressure hull is manufactured the pressure test of which is performed the strain test and deformation test shown in fig 16 are designed to measure the stresses and deformation of the mis pressure hull to verify the optimization in the strain test the strain gages are pasted in the surface of the mis pressure hull to verify the stresses of the optimization moreover to verify the compressibility of the mis pressure hull a check valve and a bladder are adopted in the test and the mis pressure hull is filled with water which can flows into the bladder when the external pressure changes table 3 shows the stress comparison of the mis pressure hull from which it can be seen that σ ϕ1 ϕ 90 and σ ϕ2 ϕ 90 in the analytical solution and pressure test are substantially consistent as shown in fig 2 b the mis pressure hull is regarded as the combination of the spherical shells and cylindrical shells in the mechanical model however there exists some construction difference in the intersection of them such as the transition fillets which may have certain influence on the stresses and displacements of this region thus the difference values of the stresses in the intersection of the spherical shells ϕ 75 in the analytical solution are a little larger than those in the strain test moreover the volume variety measured in the deformation test is 135 ml which is 93 75 of the optimization result thus the compressibility of the mis pressure hull in the optimization is ensured 6 effectiveness comparison in this section the effectiveness analysis of the mis pressure hull is carried out in comparison with the conventional cylindrical shell unlike the mis pressure hull the design of the cylindrical shell is restricted to the stability which is expressed in eq 60 60 p crc 2 59 e t c d c 2 5 l c d c where p crc t c d c and l c are the stability thickness diameter and length of the cylindrical shell respectively the values of the length l c and the external diameter d c of the cylindrical shell are same as those of the mis pressure hull thus the displacements of them are basically identical in addition the thickness of the cylindrical shell t c is a design variable which can be obtained by solving eq 60 thus all parameters of the cylindrical shell are decided in the comparison the comparative parameters of the mis pressure hull and the cylindrical shell are shown in table 4 compared with the conventional cylindrical hull the buoyancy factor of the mis pressure hull reduces by 12 89 making it possible to provide surplus 12 89 of the net buoyancy to carry extra batteries moreover the volume change of mis pressure hull is larger than that of the cylindrical hull which increases the buoyancy compensation by 69 69 yang et al 2019 introduced the petrel l glider and established an optimization to increase the gliding range the pressure hull of which is the conventional cylindrical shape the optimization is derived based on the kinematic model of the glider motion in vertical plane and the energy consumption model which is solved by the inner penalty function method in the optimization the objective function is the ratio of the gliding range to the energy consumption in one gliding cycle which expresses the gliding range of the glider per energy consumption unit the motion parameters including the ballast masses and gliding angles are selected as the optimized variables by replacing the deformation of the pressure hull of petrel l with eq 61 the effect of the neutrally buoyant hull on the gliding range of petrel l glider can be analyzed 61 δ v z z k ρ s w g z v 0 where v z is the volume change of the neutrally buoyant pressure hull ρ sw is the density of the seawater g is the acceleration of gravity z is the depth of seawater and v 0 is volume of the pressure hull at the atmospheric pressure fig 17 a shows the objective function of the optimization from which it can be seen that the application of the mis pressure hull can increase the gliding range of the glider per energy consumption when the hotel load is lower than 2 w in addition fig 17 b shows the increase rate of the gliding range compared with that of the conventional cylindrical shell with consideration of the extra batteries carried by the mis pressure hull from fig 17 b we can see that the enhancing effect is more obvious when the hotel load is lower 7 discussion and conclusion in this paper we established a mechanical model of the mis neutrally buoyant pressure hull using the thin shell theory including the membrane theory and moment theory then an optimization was built based on the mechanical model solved by the pfm algorithm and the mpga algorithm the optimization result of which was validated by the finite element analysis and the pressure test finally the effectiveness analysis of the mis pressure hull was made and the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the establishment of the mechanical model by using the thin shell theory is an effective way to design the mis pressure hull which is feasible as the neutrally buoyant pressure hull for underwater glider 2 the method by combining the pfm algorithm and the mpga algorithm is efficient to solve the optimization including the implicit expressions and ensure the global optimum 3 compared with the conventional cylindrical hull the optimized mis pressure hull in this paper can provide excess 12 89 of the net buoyancy and 69 69 of the buoyancy compensation as verified in this paper 4 the application of the neutrally buoyant hull is effective to increase the gliding range for petrel l glider and the enhancing effect is more obvious when the hotel load is lower future work will focus on the numerical optimization and the fillets can be considered in the optimization credit authorship contribution statement ming yang conceptualization

21780,the net buoyancy driving force of underwater gliders decreases gradually when the gliders dive or climb in the seawater which increases the energy consumption and reduces the gliding range the neutrally buoyant hull is an effective measure to reduce this buoyancy loss of underwater gliders in this paper a multiple intersecting spheres mis pressure hull is designed to provide neutral buoyancy a mechanical model of the hull is established with the thin shell theory based on which the optimization is carried out by combining the penalty function method pfm and multiple population genetic algorithm mpga thickness of the spherical shell reinforcing rib width of the reinforcing rib and intersection angle of the spherical shell are optimized for minimizing the buoyancy factor which is defined as the ratio of pressure hull mass to the undeformed displacement additionally the mechanical model is verified by the finite element analysis and the pressure test the results show that the mis pressure hull can increase the buoyancy compensation by 69 69 and increase battery capacity of the glider by 12 89 as compared with conventional cylindrical hull this will improve the navigation range and duration of petrel l glider more obviously when its hotel load is lower keywords auv multiple intersecting sphere neutrally buoyant hull optimization design underwater glider 1 introduction underwater gliders are one of the most promising autonomous underwater vehicles auv for long term ocean observations which have attracted much attention and been studied extensively griffiths et al 2007 since firstly conceptualized by stommel 1989 underwater gliders have been developed worldwide some underwater gliders such as the slocum webb et al 2001 the seaglider eriksen et al 2001 and the spray sherman et al 2001 have already been adopted in the ocean phenomena observation for their efficient long distance and long duration ability most underwater gliders need to operate for long duration and distance and therefore the method of saving energy and the efficient designs are necessary driven by the net buoyancy the underwater glider can dive and climb in the seawater by attaining positive and negative buoyancy eriksen et al 2001 during which its volume compressibility defined as the unit volume variation caused by the unit pressure variation is regarded as a constant the buoyancy change of the glider is mainly dependent on the physical parameters and the hull deformation yang et al 2017 due to compressibility and volumetric thermal expansion of the glider the changes of pressure density and temperature with depth cause variations in the glider s buoyancy however salinity and other factors have less influence osse and eriksen 2007 frajka williams et al 2011 for a glider with conventional hull when it ascends higher in the seawater column and the pressure relaxes it becomes less buoyant because the hull is less compressible than seawater in particular the buoyancy further changes when the glider goes through the thermocline in which the seawater density decreases faster especially at low attitudes jenkins et al 2003 this phenomenon can be found in fig 1 yang et al 2019 which shows the buoyancy loss of the conventional cylindrical hull of the chinese petrel glider consequently in order to maintain the net buoyancy necessary to return to the sea surface or reach the target depth the buoyancy engine has to consume extra energy to create an additional increment of oil volume however a hull slightly more compressible than seawater gives the minimum pump energy expenditure as it somewhat compensates for the higher density below the thermocline jenkins et al 2003 graver and grady 2005 therefore the neutrally buoyant hull the compressibility of which matches that of the seawater is effective to reduce the energy consumption of the buoyancy engine for underwater gliders davis et al 2002 jenkins et al 2003 the problem of neutrally buoyant technology has received considerable attention for several decades and resulted in numerous studies the early research of which mainly focused on the floats the neutrally buoyant float used to measure subsurface ocean currents was developed simultaneously and independently in the mid 1950s by bowden 1954 in the usa and by swallow 1955 in the uk which has been a vital tool in the exploration of the global ocean circulation and provides a central element of the in situ ocean observation system through the argo project gould 2005 introduced the development of neutrally buoyant floats from their origins in the mid 1950s to 2004 rossby et al 1985 firstly attempted to make floats more lagrangian by modifying their compressibility using a spring back piston however in the aspect of the neutrally buoyant hull simple cylindrical hulls with a large enough compressibility will fail at the design pressure and one solution is to use ring stiffened cylindrical hulls which have reinforcing ribs placed periodically along the hull to prevent buckling thus the mis hull involving a series of spheres reinforced at the intersections by ribs is gradually applied as a neutrally buoyant hull on the floats and underwater gliders d asaro 2003 introduced a deep lagrangian float hull including a series of ribs connected by cylindrical arched bays designed by a combination of numerical modeling and destructive testing the compressibility of which matches that of the seawater to the depth of 2000 m the similar improvements have been realized by a 6061t6 hull of similar design applied on the seaglider eriksen et al 2001 griffiths et al 2007 which is widely applied in the marine observation some works have been developed in designing the pressure hull reinforced by ribs garland 1968 studied the design and fabrication of deep quest and deep submergence rescue vehicle leon 1971 experimental studied an experimental investigation of intersecting titanium spheres hall et al 1991 designed a composite spherical hull reinforced by titanium alloy rings to reduce the mass of the hull liang et al 2004 investigated the optimization of a mis deep submerged pressure hull gou and cui 2009 studied the problem of structural optimization for multiple intersecting spherical pressure hulls based on kriging model tang et al 2018 applied the bi directional evolutionary structural optimization beso method to the optimization of a ring stiffened cylindrical hull for a neutrally buoyant underwater glider zhang et al 2017 analyzed the numerical and experimental results of buckling of bi segment spherical shells with reinforcing rib of different size du et al 2015 established a whole welding steel toroidal model with ring stiffened ribs and studied by nonlinear fe method wang and guo 2016 presented a semi analytical method to analysis the vibration response of submerged stiffened combined shells xie et al 2015 presented an analytic approach to analyze free and forced vibration of submerged ring stiffened conical shell with arbitrary boundary conditions at low frequencies foryś 2015 introduced an optimization of a simply supported cylindrical shell stiffened by inner ribs under external pressure although some researches about designing and optimizing the mis pressure hull have been reported the mechanical model of mis pressure hull in previous works is simplified meanwhile very few works about deducing exact deformation and stresses of the mis pressure hull have been reported because of the lack of theoretical formulas which need to be considered in the optimization of the neutrally buoyant pressure hull for underwater gliders moreover there are few reports analyzing the effect of the neutrally buoyant pressure hull applied on the underwater gliders in this paper an efficient method is developed to optimize the mis neutrally buoyant hull for underwater gliders the main contributions of this paper are in two aspects 1 an analytical model of mis pressure hull subject to external pressure is established by thin shell theory which is then employed in an optimization framework to reduce the buoyancy factor 2 the effect of the mis neutrally buoyant hull on the gliding range of the underwater gliders is analyzed quantitatively in comparison with the conventional cylindrical hull accordingly this study presents an optimization design of the mis neutrally buoyant hull the optimization established based on the theory of the thin shell including the membrane theory and moment theory aims to minimize the buoyancy factor design variables in the optimization model include the thickness of the spherical shell the thickness of the reinforcing rib the width of the reinforcing rib and the angle of the intersection of the spherical shells some constraints are considered in this paper including the compressibility constraint of the pressure hull the stress constraints the stability constraints and the side constraints of the design variables an optimization procedure is implemented to solve this nonlinear constrained optimization problem the finite element analysis and the pressure test are implemented to verify the validity of the optimization result finally the application of the neutrally buoyant pressure hull on the underwater glider is analyzed quantitatively 2 mechanical modeling 2 1 mis configuration the mis pressure hull involves a series of spherical shells reinforced at their intersections by reinforcing ribs as shown in fig 2 a the shell thickness of the spherical shells t the shell middle surface radius r the shell intersection angle ϕ 0 the reinforcing rib width b and the reinforcing rib height h are defined in fig 2 b the reinforcing ribs can prevent buckling of the hull and the spherical shells transfer the pressure forces acting on the hull to the ribs while maintaining a nearly constant stress within the material which makes the mis pressure hull strong compressible and very light d asaro 2003 in addition the structure of the reinforcing ribs allow a larger access path between spherical shells which increases the space utilization of the entire mis pressure hull liang et al 2004 2 2 mechanical modeling a mis pressure hull is subjected to hydraulic pressure on the spherical shells and the two end closure bulkheads when analyzing this type of structure in the engineering field the membrane theory is firstly applied to solve membrane forces to get an approximate solution and then the marginal moments are analyzed by the moment theory finally a complete solution is obtained by combining them together under some boundary conditions timoshenko and woinowsky krieger 1959 2 2 1 the spherical shell the forces applied on the spherical shell are illustrated by fig 3 which includes the axial internal force q the radial internal force h the moment m and the external hydrostatic pressure p the axial internal force q can be expressed by eq 1 1 q p π r t 2 2 2 π r sin ϕ 0 2 2 1 1 analysis with the membrane theory the membrane theory is widely applied in analyzing the elastic thin shells which plays an important role in the shell theory when the membrane theory is adopted the marginal shear forces and the marginal moments are ignored because of their edge effect therefore the free body diagram can be given as shown in fig 4 the equilibrium equations physical equations and geometric equations of rotational symmetric spherical shell in the spherical coordinate frame timoshenko and woinowsky krieger 1959 are shown in the following eqs 2 4 2 n ϕ ϕ n

utilizing the boundary condition u s1 π 2 0 finally u s1 and w s1 can be solved the expression of which are complex 2 2 1 2 analysis with the moment theory in fact the situation that the thin shells merely bear membrane stress is impossible because of the shearing forces and the moments imposed on the edge of the shells hence the moment theory analysis of the thin shell is necessary the free body diagram in the moment theory analysis is shown in fig 5 using the moment theory timoshenko and woinowsky krieger 1959 analyzed the rotational symmetry spherical shell without opening in which only the first solution of the hypergeometric equation 10 was involved however the second solution is utilized in the analysis of the spherical shell with axisymmetric opening 10 d 2 q ϕ d ϕ 2 cot ϕ d q ϕ d ϕ

ρ is defined in eq 14 14 ρ 2 3 r 2 1 μ 2 t 2 μ 2 4 the internal forces n ϕ and n θ can be calculated as shown by eq 15 15 n ϕ q ϕ cot ϕ n θ d q ϕ d ϕ the angle of rotation v s on the edge of the spherical shell is shown by eq 16 16 v s μ a 1 2 a 2 ρ 2 e t r z 1 μ a 2 2 a 1 ρ 2 e t r z 2 the moments m sϕ and m sθ can be calculated by eq 17 17 m sϕ e t 3 12 1 μ 2 1 r d v s d ϕ μ cot ϕ r v s m s

reinforcing rib the axial force q is ignored because of its negligible impact on the short cylinder shell therefore the forces applied on the cylinder shell are illustrated by fig 6 including the radial internal force h the moment of force m and the external hydrostatic pressure p 2 2 2 1 analysis with the membrane theory the reinforcing rib can be regarded as a thick walled cylinder shell and the deflection of the reinforcing rib at the intersection of the shell is 21 w c 1 2 h r sin ϕ 0 e b 1 c 2 1 c 2 μ where c is the ratio of the inner diameter to the external diameter 22 c r sin ϕ 0 h r sin ϕ 0 2 2 2 2 analysis with the moment theory when analyzing the symmetric cylindrical shell with bending theory the radial displacement can be expressed as follows with hyperbolic functions 23 w c 2 c 3 sin 3 1 μ 2 r sin ϕ 0 h 2 1 4 x s h 3 1 μ 2 r sin ϕ 0 h 2 1 4 x c 4 cos 3 1 μ 2 r sin ϕ 0 h 2 1 4 x c h 3 1 μ 2 4 r sin ϕ 0 h 2 1 4 x where c 3 and c 4 are the integration constants the moment m c and shearing q c can be calculated by eq 23 as shown in eq 24 24 m c e h 3 12 1 μ 2 d 2 w c 2 d x 2 q c e h 3 12 1 μ 2 d 3 w c 2 d x 3 and the constants c 1 and c 2 can be calculated by the boundary conditions shown in eq 25 25 m c x b 2 m q c x b 2 0 furthermore the intersection angle on the edge of the rib is 26 v 2 d δ r 2 d x x b 2 2 2 3 compatibility of deformation to keep compatibility of deformation the deflection and deformation of the spherical shell are accordingly equal to those of the reinforcing rib therefore the moment m and internal force h can be solved by eq 27 27 w s 1 w s 2 sin ϕ 0 u s 1 u s 2 cos ϕ 0 w c 1 w c 2 x b 2 v s v c 2 3 some parameters of the hull some parameters of the hull referred to in the following optimization are shown as follows 2 3 1 buoyancy factor the buoyancy factor is selected as the objective function in the conventional hull structure design defined as the radio of the hull weight to displaced water volume the hull mass m hull of the mis neutrally buoyant hull is shown in eq 28 28 m hull 2 n r cos ϕ 0 π r t 2 2 r t 2 2 ρ m π n 2 h r sin ϕ 0 h 2 b ρ m where n is the segment number of the spherical shell and ρ m is the density of the shell material and the hull volume v 0 under normal atmospheric pressure is expressed by eq 29 29 v 0 n ρ w ϕ 0 ϕ π r t 2 sin ϕ 3 d ϕ π r t 2 sin ϕ 0 2 b here ρ w is the density of the water therefore the buoyancy factor f can be calculated by eqs 28 and 29 30 f m hull ρ w v 0 2 3 2 space utilization in this study the inner space utilization rate is considered in the optimization of the pressure hull defined as the ratio of the inner useable volume to the total volume of the hull the space utilization r s is shown by eq 31 31 r s n π r sin ϕ 0 2 b 2 r cos ϕ 0 v 0 2 3 3 compressibility the deformation of the hull under the hydrostatic pressure p can be divided into three portions the circumferential volume change of the spherical shells v p1 the circumferential volume change of the reinforcing ribs v p2 and the axial volume change of the spherical shells v p3 which are expressed by eq 32 eq 33 and eq 34 32 v p 1 n ϕ 0 ϕ π r t 2 sin ϕ w s sin ϕ 0 u s cos ϕ 0

35 v p v p 1 v p 2 v p 3 the coefficient of volume compressibility k can be calculated by its definition shown as follows 36 k v p v 0 v p p when considering the net buoyancy loss the influence of the temperature on the hull volume is ignored which is insignificant compared to the pressure influence therefore the net buoyancy loss in the diving phase can be expressed as follows 37 δ b ρ sw h g v 0 1 k p δ p δ ρ s w ρ s w δ p k here δb is the net buoyancy loss of the pressure hull ρ sw is the seawater density changing with the depth δp is the pressure difference and δρ sw is the density difference to minimize δb the compressibility of the hull k should be close to the expression δρ sw ρ sw δp which is nonlinear as illustrated by fig 7 it can be seen from fig 7 that the compressibility of the seawater varies approximately linearly with depth below the depth of 300 m as the glider volume variation is linear it is possible that the glider hull can compensate for the buoyancy loss after 300 m tang et al 2018 fig 7 a shows the seawater density in south china sea and fig 7 b is the compressibility of seawater calculated by seawater density in this paper the compressibility k is 0 59 10 9 1 pa by calculating the average value from the depth of 300 m to the depth of 1000 m shown by the imaginary line in fig 7 b 2 3 4 stress if the distance between the ribs is small enough the hull fails when the stress in the arches exceeds the strength of the material rather than by buckling this is desirable because material failure unlike buckling is easy to model and predict d asaro 2003 therefore in order to avoid material failure the stresses need to be analyzed in particular 2 3 4 1 stresses of the spherical shell based on the mechanical analytical model of the hull the latitudinal tangential stress on the external surface of the spherical shell σ ϕ1 the latitudinal tangential stress on the internal surface of the spherical shell σ ϕ2 the longitudinal tangential stress on the external surface of the spherical shell σ θ1 and the longitudinal tangential stress on internal surface of the spherical shell σ θ2 are deduced by eq 6 and eq 17 38 σ ϕ 1 n ϕ

b p 1 c 2 2 3 5 stability the instability of the hull is herein considered to prevent the buckling failure the failure forms of the mis pressure hull including the local instability and the general instability are decided by its structural size the schematic diagrams of which are shown in fig 8 when the stiffness of the reinforcing ribs is larger than that of the spherical shells the local instability occurs with the increase of the uniform external pressure in which the spherical shells transform into a half wave between the neighbouring rigid ribs contrariwise the general instability occurs in which the entire mis pressure hull transforms into a half wave and only the edges of the hull keep rigid as presented by nash nash 1995 the empirical expression for hydrostatic buckling pressure p crl of mis pressure hull is 43 p crl 1 0 175 70 0 ϕ 0 20 0 1 0 7 r 400 t 0 3 e t 2 r 2 as for the general instability of the mis pressure hull there is not yet an accurate expression however there exists the standard formulation of the general instability of the stiffened cylindrical hull the construction of which is similar to that of the mis pressure hull thus the general instability of mis pressure hull is obtained by modifying the general instability of a stiffened cylindrical shell similarly liang et al 2004 adopted this approximation method when optimizing the mis pressure hull therefore the effective general instability of the mis pressure is considered herein based on the general instability of the stiffened cylindrical shell developed by kendrick and modified by bryant comstock 1967 accordingly the expression for the critical general buckling pressure of mis pressure hull with multiple intersecting spheres p cr is 44 p cr e t r e m 4 n m 2 m 2 2 1

fig 1 b the thickness of the spherical shell t the angle of the shell intersection ϕ 0 the width of the reinforcing ribs b and the height of the reinforcing ribs h are taken as the design variables in the optimization design 3 2 objective function in this paper the research focuses on the influence of the pressure hull design on the gliding range of the glider which shows in two aspects 1 the pressure hull with smaller buoyancy factor can provide more buoyancy to accommodate batteries 2 the compressibility of the pressure hull which matches that of the seawater can reduce the buoyancy loss of the glider the former is ensured by the objective function and the latter is ensured by the deformation constraint therefore the displacement of pressure hull is basically a constant and the mass is optimized to be minimum in this paper however for the situation of certain payload additional volume would be more desirable thus the objective of the optimization design is to minimize the buoyancy factor the objective function f is 45 f f 3 3 constraint conditions to ensure the reliability of the structure some constraint conditions must be satisfied as described below 3 3 1 strength constraints the intersection of the spherical shell and the reinforcing rib is the most dangerous region because of stress concentration hence according to the third strength theory the strength constraints can be expressed as follows 46 g 1 0 85 σ s σ ϕ 1 ϕ π 2 0 47 g 2 0 85 σ s σ ϕ 2 ϕ π 2 0 48 g 3 1 15 σ s σ θ 1 ϕ ϕ 0 0 49 g 4 1 15 σ s σ θ 2 ϕ ϕ 0 0 50 g 5 0 6 σ s σ r 0 3 3 2 stability constraints in order to avoid buckling in the spherical shell the shell lobar buckling constraints can be expressed as follows 51 g 6 p crl 1 5 p 0 52 g 7 p cr 1 5 p 0 3 3 3 space utilization constraint because of the existence of reinforcing ribs the space utilization of the mis pressure hull is lower than that of the conventional cylindrical shell therefore the space utilization constraint is necessary for the optimization of the mis pressure hull 53 g 8 r s 0 7 0 3 3 4 deformation constraint in order to make the pressure hull neutrally buoyant the compressibility of the mis pressure hull needs to satisfy the following equality constraint 54 h 1 k 0 59 10 9 0 3 3 5 side constraints in addition each design variable needs to have a feasible region in which the optimum value can be obtained the value ranges of the design variables need to be large enough to ensure the validity of the optimization results the maximum value of the thickness of the spherical shell is decided empirically while the intersection angle of the shell is influenced by the space utilization constraint in addition the maximum values of the height and the width of the reinforcing rib are decided by the geometric construction of the mis pressure hull thus the value ranges of the design variables are large enough and the optimization results are within the side constraints the side constraint of the thickness of the spherical shell is 55 0 1 t 6 the side constraint of the intersection angle of the shell is 56 60 o ϕ 0 75 o the side constraint of the height of the reinforcing rib is 57 0 h r sin ϕ 0 the side constraint of the width of the reinforcing rib is 58 0 b 2 r cos ϕ 0 3 4 solution algorithm in this paper the optimal design problem of mis pressure hull is a nonlinear constrained optimization problem concerning the equality constraint and the inequality constraints thus in order to make it convenient to solve this problem the pfm algorithm is employed to transform the constrained optimization into an unconstrained one therefore the fitness values of the points violating the constraints in the population of each iteration are obviously larger than those of the points satisfying the constraints because of the penalty function thus these points are discarded in each iteration and there are no better minima being discarded due to constraint violation the expression of the transformed mixed penalty function is 59 φ x r k f x r v 1 q h v 2 x g 1 m x 0 f x s u 1 m g u 2 x r v 1 q h v 2 x e l s e where ϕ x r k is the augmented objective function f x is the objective function x is the vector of design variables g u x is the inequality constraint h v x is the equality constraint r r 1 1014 and s s 1 are the penalty factor of equality constraints and inequality constraints respectively m is the number of the inequality constraints and q is the number of the equality constraints however owing to the complexity of solving the mechanical model in section 2 2 it is difficult to directly obtain the explicit analytical expression of the moment m and internal force h expressed by the design variables some optimization algorithms based on the explicit analytical expression such as newton method and gradient method can t solve this problem thus the standard genetic algorithm sga whitley 1994 reeves and rowe 2005 without the limitation of the function derivative has strong robustness and powerful ability of global search which is efficient to solve the optimization problem in this paper however when the sga is adopted to solve the optimization different results are obtained in each optimization and the problems of local optimization and premature constringency appear to avoid these problems the mpga method alshraideh et al 2011 applying collaborative optimization of multiple populations with different control parameters is adopted to solve the optimization now an integrated mathematic model of the optimization design has been established and the mpga toolbox is used to seek the optimal solution in the matlab software the program chart is shown in fig 9 and the steps of the optimization are as follows 1 input the mechanical model of the mis pressure hull established in section 2 and establish the augmented objective function eq 59 as the fitness function by combining the objective function and the constraints using the pfm algorithm 2 generate the initial populations in which the individual number is 40 and the population number is 10 3 calculate the fitness values and set nn 1 4 if the fitness values meets the requirement that the optimal fitness value is uniform in continuous 30 iterations or n t t 50 output the optimization result if not update the populations by the mpga algorithm and return to step 3 until the requirement in step 4 is met 4 optimization result in the mpga algorithm the control parameters of each population including the crossover operator and mutation operator are set to be different in order to ensure the global search capability and local search capability the values of which are selected randomly from the ranges of 0 7 0 9 and 0 001 0 05 respectively as shown in fig 10 fig 11 shows the optimization results and the ruleless trend of the design variables fig 12 shows the optimal fitness value of each generation from which the convergence process of the optimization can be seen table 1 shows the optimization result of the fitness value and design variables 5 finite element analysis and pressure test 5 1 finite element analysis to validate the correctness of the optimization the finite element analysis shown in fig 13 is performed in the ansys workbench software based on the optimization result in which the displacements and stresses are contrasted with the analytical solution fig 14 shows the longitudinal displacement comparison and lateral displacement comparison of the spherical shell from which it can be seen that the longitudinal displacement at the intersection of the spherical shell is larger than that in the middle of the spherical shell and that the lateral displacement of the spherical shell varies substantially linearly with the angle moreover it can be seen that the trends of the displacements in the analytical solution are substantially same as those in the numerical solution the errors in table 2 are negligible and thus the compressibility of the mis pressure hull in the optimization is ensured fig 15 show the stress comparison of the pressure hull and it can be seen that the stress variation trend in the numerical solution is substantially consistent with that in the analytical solution however the difference values of the stresses in the intersection of the spherical shells ϕ 75 are a little larger than those in the middle of the spherical shells ϕ 90 5 2 pressure test in order to further verify the optimization result the model of the optimized pressure hull is manufactured the pressure test of which is performed the strain test and deformation test shown in fig 16 are designed to measure the stresses and deformation of the mis pressure hull to verify the optimization in the strain test the strain gages are pasted in the surface of the mis pressure hull to verify the stresses of the optimization moreover to verify the compressibility of the mis pressure hull a check valve and a bladder are adopted in the test and the mis pressure hull is filled with water which can flows into the bladder when the external pressure changes table 3 shows the stress comparison of the mis pressure hull from which it can be seen that σ ϕ1 ϕ 90 and σ ϕ2 ϕ 90 in the analytical solution and pressure test are substantially consistent as shown in fig 2 b the mis pressure hull is regarded as the combination of the spherical shells and cylindrical shells in the mechanical model however there exists some construction difference in the intersection of them such as the transition fillets which may have certain influence on the stresses and displacements of this region thus the difference values of the stresses in the intersection of the spherical shells ϕ 75 in the analytical solution are a little larger than those in the strain test moreover the volume variety measured in the deformation test is 135 ml which is 93 75 of the optimization result thus the compressibility of the mis pressure hull in the optimization is ensured 6 effectiveness comparison in this section the effectiveness analysis of the mis pressure hull is carried out in comparison with the conventional cylindrical shell unlike the mis pressure hull the design of the cylindrical shell is restricted to the stability which is expressed in eq 60 60 p crc 2 59 e t c d c 2 5 l c d c where p crc t c d c and l c are the stability thickness diameter and length of the cylindrical shell respectively the values of the length l c and the external diameter d c of the cylindrical shell are same as those of the mis pressure hull thus the displacements of them are basically identical in addition the thickness of the cylindrical shell t c is a design variable which can be obtained by solving eq 60 thus all parameters of the cylindrical shell are decided in the comparison the comparative parameters of the mis pressure hull and the cylindrical shell are shown in table 4 compared with the conventional cylindrical hull the buoyancy factor of the mis pressure hull reduces by 12 89 making it possible to provide surplus 12 89 of the net buoyancy to carry extra batteries moreover the volume change of mis pressure hull is larger than that of the cylindrical hull which increases the buoyancy compensation by 69 69 yang et al 2019 introduced the petrel l glider and established an optimization to increase the gliding range the pressure hull of which is the conventional cylindrical shape the optimization is derived based on the kinematic model of the glider motion in vertical plane and the energy consumption model which is solved by the inner penalty function method in the optimization the objective function is the ratio of the gliding range to the energy consumption in one gliding cycle which expresses the gliding range of the glider per energy consumption unit the motion parameters including the ballast masses and gliding angles are selected as the optimized variables by replacing the deformation of the pressure hull of petrel l with eq 61 the effect of the neutrally buoyant hull on the gliding range of petrel l glider can be analyzed 61 δ v z z k ρ s w g z v 0 where v z is the volume change of the neutrally buoyant pressure hull ρ sw is the density of the seawater g is the acceleration of gravity z is the depth of seawater and v 0 is volume of the pressure hull at the atmospheric pressure fig 17 a shows the objective function of the optimization from which it can be seen that the application of the mis pressure hull can increase the gliding range of the glider per energy consumption when the hotel load is lower than 2 w in addition fig 17 b shows the increase rate of the gliding range compared with that of the conventional cylindrical shell with consideration of the extra batteries carried by the mis pressure hull from fig 17 b we can see that the enhancing effect is more obvious when the hotel load is lower 7 discussion and conclusion in this paper we established a mechanical model of the mis neutrally buoyant pressure hull using the thin shell theory including the membrane theory and moment theory then an optimization was built based on the mechanical model solved by the pfm algorithm and the mpga algorithm the optimization result of which was validated by the finite element analysis and the pressure test finally the effectiveness analysis of the mis pressure hull was made and the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the establishment of the mechanical model by using the thin shell theory is an effective way to design the mis pressure hull which is feasible as the neutrally buoyant pressure hull for underwater glider 2 the method by combining the pfm algorithm and the mpga algorithm is efficient to solve the optimization including the implicit expressions and ensure the global optimum 3 compared with the conventional cylindrical hull the optimized mis pressure hull in this paper can provide excess 12 89 of the net buoyancy and 69 69 of the buoyancy compensation as verified in this paper 4 the application of the neutrally buoyant hull is effective to increase the gliding range for petrel l glider and the enhancing effect is more obvious when the hotel load is lower future work will focus on the numerical optimization and the fillets can be considered in the optimization credit authorship contribution statement ming yang conceptualization

21781,in this paper cross flow vibrations of two identical elastically mounted circular cylinders in tandem arrangement have been investigated in a wind channel at reynolds number re 4000 42000 the spacing ratios s d are from 1 2 to 8 0 the vibration amplitude oscillation frequency f o and vortex shedding frequency f s are investigated based on the vibration characteristics three regimes can be

introduction vortex induced vibration viv of an isolated circular cylinder free to vibrate in the cross flow cf direction has been made great achievements in the past decades a number of significant phenomena and conclusions have been revealed by previous investigators one can refer to the reviews by bearman 1984 parkinson 1989 blevins 1990 sarpkaya 2004 and williamson and govardhan 2004 however there are many multiple cylindrical structures applied in practical engineering such as risers offshore platforms tubes of heat exchangers bridge cables high voltage transmission lines etc as the most basic and simplest configuration of multiple cylindrical structures the studies on a two cylinder system are of fundamental and practical significance early experiments mainly focusing on the fluid flow of structures have been performed many on two stationary cylinders zdravkovich 1987 1988 classified the flow pattern of two staggered arrangement cylinders into three regimes no interference regime where the downstream cylinder is far apart from the upstream one there is no effect on each other just like a single cylinder proximity interference is the region where the downstream cylinder is close enough to suffer interference from the flow deflected by the upstream cylinder but is not immersed in its wake finally when the downstream cylinder is immersed in the wake of the upstream cylinder partially or completely it is called the wake interference igarashi 1981 carried out experimental investigations on the characteristics of the flow around two tandem stationary cylinders he presented a detailed classification of the flow structure depended on spacing ratios s d from 1 03d to 5d and re from 8 7 103 to 5 2 104 zhou and yiu 2006 performed a series of similar experiments the flow structure can be generally classified into three regimes depended on s d and re i extended body regime in this regime the two cylinders are sufficiently close that the shear layers generated from upstream cylinder overshoot downstream cylinder just like a single body ii reattached regime where the separated shear layers can reattach on the downstream cylinder iii co shedding regime the distance between the cylinders is sufficiently far apart that the separated shear layers from the upstream cylinder roll up and vortex streets can be formed in the gap and behind the rear cylinder some related reviews on this topic can be found in zdravkovich 1988 sumner 2010 zhou and alam 2016 flow induced vibration fiv of one fixed one free tandem arrangement cylinders has been studied by a large number of investigators and some excellent findings have been achieved in this regime the upstream cylinder is fixed and the rear one can freely vibrate in the cf direction bokaian and geoola 1984a investigated the fiv of two rigid cylinders arranged in tandem by performing water channel experiments mass ratio m 8 4 damping ratio ζ 0 013 it was found that depending on s d m and ζ the downstream cylinder exhibited four dynamic regimes galloping only vortex resonance vr only separated vr and galloping and combined vr and galloping brika and laneville 1999 carried out experiment to investigate the vibration response of a flexible cylinder in the wake of a stationary one using wind tunnel under the conditions of re 5000 27000 s d 6 5 24 5 m 821 ζ 0 00008 the spacing ratio s d presented a significant influence on the dynamic response of the rear flexible cylinder with the increasing of s d the vibration amplitude decreased and it could be inferred that the response would resemble that of an isolated cylinder when s d was larger than a critical value hover and triantafyllou 2001 performed an experiment with an elastically mounted downstream cylinder towed behind an identical fixed one for 4 75 diameters in water in their experiment re 30000 m 3 0 and ζ 0 04 the vibration amplitude increased monotonically as a function of reduced velocity u r and reached the maximum amplitude a max d 1 9 at u r 17 assi et al 2010 investigated the mechanism of wake induced vibrations wiv of two cylinders in a tandem arrangement m 2 6 and ζ 0 007 they suggested that wiv could be attributed to the unsteady vortex structure interactions between the downstream cylinder and the vortex shedding from the upstream body a combined viv and wiv can be observed in the experiment at s d 6 0 while with the increasing of s d the vibration response tending to a single cylinder qin et al 2017 experimental investigated the fiv of a elastically mounted cylinder with larger diameter d placed behind a fixed one with a smaller diameter d where the d d 0 2 1 0 and s d 1 0 5 5 they noted that the large scale vibration is more likely to occur at smaller d d as s d increases the fiv characteristics become more complicated when the two cylinders can both vibrate freely kim et al 2009 carried out a series of experiments to investigate the free vibration response of two rigid cylinders in cf using wind tunnel the system had a mass damping ratio m ζ of 0 65 and s d was from 1 1 to 4 2 companied with reduced velocity u r 1 5 26 depending on s d and vibration characteristics different amplitude response regimes can be observed the vibration was absent at 1 1 s d 1 2 and 3 0 s d 3 7 both cylinders suffered violent galloping response at 1 2 s d 1 6 for u r 6 at 1 6 s d 3 0 the convergent vibration could be observed around u r 6 7 at s d 3 7 each cylinder resembled a single cylinder since the spacing ratio s d is far enough however the vortex shedding frequency was not examined in their experiment huear huarte and bearman 2011 performed experiments on the dynamic responses of two flexible cylinders in tandem arrangement using water tunnel m ζ 0 043 s d 2 0 4 0 the upstream cylinder presented larger vibration than the downstream cylinder at s d 2 0 2 5 for u r 4 9 while for large spacing ratio s d 3 0 4 0 the downstream cylinder exhibited non classical viv with violent vibration at high u r huear huarte and gharib 2011 further studied the responses at s d 4 0 8 0 far wake interference it can be demonstrated that the upstream cylinder displayed a typical viv behavior similar to a single cylinder while the rear one presented wiv with large amplitude even though the u r beyond the classical lock in region when the s d was large enough huang and herfjord 2013 investigated the fiv of two elastically mounted rigid cylinders in staggered and tandem arrangement they found that the motion trajectories of the downstream cylinder were depended on whether the two cylinders were in tandem or staggered arrangement they also discussed the influence of the local reduced velocity for downstream cylinder on the its own vibration response the local reduced velocity was not measured but estimated by a wake velocity model by using a towing tank armin et al 2018 performed experiments on the responses of two tandem elastically mounted cylinders with reynolds numbers ranging from 8 7 103 to 5 2 104 the cylinders can vibrate in both in line il and cross flow cf direction and the spacing ratios s d were set from 3 5d to 20d they found that for all spacing ratios the upstream cylinder undergone viv response which was similar to the single cylinder however the downstream cylinder was significantly influenced by the front one and the s d another important phenomenon was that the two cylinders vibrated at different frequencies which was contrary to the previous conclusions on the fixed one qin et al 2018 carried out a series of experiments to study the cf vibration of two tandem cylinders with six different natural frequencies 0 6 0 8 1 0 1 2 1 4 1 6 two spacing ratios s d 1 5 2 0 were chosen to analysis base on the natural frequency ratios and reduced velocity three regimes can be distinguished no lock in vortex excitation galloping regimes xu et al 2019 presented experimental results of two elastically mounted tandem cylinders in cf direction by using a water tunnel with m ζ 0 027 at re 28600 11400 four spacing ratios s d 1 57 2 57 3 57 4 57 were chosen in their experiment results indicated that the vibration amplitude frequency response and total fluid force coefficient of upstream cylinder were similar to those of an isolated cylinder at higher spacing ratio s d 2 57 3 57 4 57 for u r 12 while at s d 1 57 it presented galloping response with a divergent amplitude vibration the downstream cylinder experienced viv like response with wider lock in region for all the spacing ratios tested in their experiment except experimental investigations on the fiv of two elastically mounted tandem cylinders there exist a number of numerical simulations focusing on this topic as well most of them carried out at low re such as mittal and kumar 2001 papaioannou et al 2008 prasanth and mittal 2009 borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 wang et al 2017 papaioannou et al 2008 studied the effect of s d on the vibration response of two tandem cylinders in two degrees of freedom at re 160 for m ζ 0 127 three spacing ratios s d 2 5 3 5 and 5 were selected it can be observed that the viv region of the upstream cylinder was sensitive to s d and it became wider at smaller s d attributing to the shielding effect the response curves of the rear were shifted toward higher values of u r than those of upstream cylinder for all examined s d borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 focused on the fiv of two tandem cylinders with one and two degrees of freedom in the near wake interference region s d 1 5 at re 200 two vibration situations could be illustrated at low u r the vibration amplitude of the upstream cylinder was greater than that of the rear one while once u r increased to a critical value the downstream cylinder would undergo violent vibration with larger amplitude than that of the front one wang et al 2017 investigated the viv of two tandem flexible cylinders using a two way fluid structure interaction fsi method the simulations were performed for re 500 at three spacing ratios s d 2 5 3 5 5 0 with m 10 and ζ 0 it was observed that the upstream cylinder presented a typical viv response for all s d examined the downstream cylinder was also similar to the typical viv at small spacing ratios while when the spacing was large enough that the shear layers from the upstream cylinder can roll up in the gap it experienced wiv with a large amplitude at high u r lin et al 2020 numerically investigated the fiv of two tandem elastically mounted cylinders at subcritical reynolds numbers with s d 4 0 they found that the variation of the vortex shedding frequency of the upstream cylinder had a weak influence on the amplitude and dominant frequency of the rear one and the fiv characteristics of the downstream cylinder presented a significant dependence on the reynolds number fiv of two elastically mounted tandem arrangement cylinders is influenced by a number of parameters such as spacing ratio s d mass damping ratio m ζ reynolds number re and initial test conditions used in the experiment therefore despite performing a number of experimental and numerical studies in the past on this field some issues are still needed to be conducted to have a better understanding for example what are the responses including vibration amplitude oscillation frequency and vortex shedding frequency with a mass damping ratio m ζ 0 2 in air which is usually larger than that in water how do the initial test conditions from rest and increasing velocity used in the experiment affect the vibration response and whether there existing a hysteresis phenomenon what is the underlying mechanism of hysteresis phenomenon and why it only occurs at some small s d how does the initial state of the neighbouring cylinder fixed or elastically mounted affect the amplitude response of the other one here this paper aims to address the above issues the spacing ratio s d varied from 1 2 to 8 0 from proximal to far wake two initial test conditions from rest and increasing velocity are used in the experiment i from rest regime the cylinder is released from rest at any given u r with human intervention ii increasing velocity regime the cylinder starts to vibrate at a steady state amplitude produced by the previous and continuously increasing u r without outside interference the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the experimental set up is described experimental methodology validation and preliminary results for a single cylinder are given in section 3 section 4 presents the results and discussions for the two identical elastically mounted cylinders the conclusion of the work is shown in section 5 2 experimental details the experiments were carried out in a low speed wind tunnel with a test section of 0 6 m in width 0 6 m in height and 2 0 m in length the turbulent strength scale is less than 0 2 further details of the wind tunnel were introduced by gu et al 2012 sui et al 2016 and liang et al 2018 two hollow cylinders are horizontally mounted in tandem arrangement fig 1 a in the test section with outer diameter d 50 mm and inner diameter d 48 mm the length of each cylinder is 540 mm with aspect ratio of 10 8 and blockage of 7 5 approximately the cylinders are made of plexiglass to keep low mass and excellent smoothness each cylinder was supported by four spiral springs made of stainless steel respectively at each side eight spiral springs used in total and can only vibrate in the cf direction fig 1 b the free stream velocity was in the range of 1 2 m s 12 5 m s in the current test with the corresponding reynolds number 4000 42000 and u r 2 4 25 0 the mass ratios m of the upstream and downstream cylinders are both 268 9 in order to measure the damping ratios ζ and natural frequency f n a series of free decay experiments were conducted in still air that is the cylinder is excited to oscillate freely by giving an initial displacement the free decay duration curve is presented in fig 2 a the value of damping ratios ζ is estimated to be 0 00075 and as a result the combined mass damping ratio m ζ can be yielded 0 20 the value of natural frequency f n is 10 05 hz which can be determined by fast fourier transform fft on the basis of free decay experimental displacement data fig 2 b the displacement responses y of the upstream and downstream cylinders were measured utilizing a laser sensor il 300 keyence after the vibrations stabilizes the oscillation frequencies of the cylinders can be obtained via fft based on the measured displacement data the streamwise fluctuating velocities u were measured through a hot wire probe named hw dantec 55p11 which was placed behind the downstream cylinder as shown in fig 1 b the horizontal and vertical distances between the hot wire probe and downstream cylinder remain unchanged 4d in horizontal and 1d in vertical though s d varying the sampling rate is set to be 1024hz and the majority sampling duration used for calculation is 20 s when the cylinder achieves the stable vibration for few special cases which fail to achieve a steady state beating phenomenon shown in fig 7 d longer time will be used 3 experimental methodology validation and preliminary results to verify the experimental methodology and ensure the characteristics of the upstream and downstream cylinders being identical separated tests for the two cylinders were preliminarily performed the non dimensional amplitude responses a d of present experimental results versus reduced velocity u r together with the past outstanding researches for comparison are shown in fig 3 and fig 3 b plots the vortex shedding frequencies f s for the separated upstream and downstream cylinders at present study particularly the amplitude a is calculated by multiplying the root mean square r m s value of displacement signal y by 2 when the vibration is stable as shown in fig 3 a and b the vibration amplitude responses and vortex shedding frequency ratios are nearly the same implying both cylinders are strictly identical to each other two typical branches initial and lower branches can be observed the viv region lock in region occurs at around u r 4 6 8 7 associated with f s f n 1 and the maximum value of vibration amplitude occurs at around u r 6 0 once beyond the range the vibration is weak and f s f n almost follows st 0 19 line which is very close to 0 2 when the cylinder is stationary these characteristics are in good agreement to the previous results in wind tunnel with large m ζ such as feng 1968 sui et al 2016 and liang et al 2018 while an upper branch with very large amplitude is presented in the experiments by armin et al 2018 and huang and herfjord 2013 for small m ζ in water tunnel and the lock in regions are also wider this can be mainly attributed to the influence of mass damping ratio m ζ the non dimensional maximum amplitudes a max d are displayed in fig 4 as a function of m ζ including several experimental data carried out by previous investigators such as zhou et al 2011 and assi et al 2013 etc the blue line represents a curve fitting to the results of a large number of previous researches compiled originally by griffin 1980 and updated after by skop et al 1997 as can be seen from the graph the current result can fit the curve well therefore the present method is well validated by an experiment of classical single cylinder for high m ζ in wind tunnel 4 results and discussion the cf vibration characteristics of two elastically mounted cylinders in tandem arrangement are systematically investigated primarily under the initial condition of increasing velocity depending on spacing ratio s d and reduced velocity u r the results are presented including non dimensional vibration amplitude a d oscillation frequency f o and vortex shedding frequency f s and then the influence of initial test conditions from rest and increasing velocity on the vibration responses of the two cylinders and the influence of initial states fixed or elastically mounted of the neighbouring cylinder on the other one are studied and discussed respectively 4 1 vibration characteristics depending on s d fig 5 illustrates the non dimensional amplitudes of the upstream a u n and downstream cylinders a d n versus u r depending on s d comparing to that of the single cylinder in fig 3 the vibration amplitude responses are more complicated it is evident that the amplitudes are really sensitive to s d and u r based on the vibration characteristics of the two cylinders three regimes can be classified 4 1 1 vibration characteristics in regimeⅰ s d 1 5 in this regime the upstream cylinder experiences galloping vibration while a d n undergoes fluctuating with multiple peaks as a function of u r and a u n is roughly greater than a d n during the whole range of examined u r at s d 1 2 see fig 5 a both of them start to vibrate at around u r 3 7 earlier than that of the single cylinder and maintain nearly the same trend until at u r 5 1 after that a u n still increases rapidly as the u r gets larger and achieves a peak of about 1 4 at u r 18 5 generally speaking a u n is rising with the increasing of u r indicating the occurrence of galloping vibration even though along with a slight fluctuation whereas a d n achieves the first hump with a local peak at u r 6 4 which is very closed to the point of the maximum amplitude takes place for the single cylinder and then continues to increase rapidly and undergoes a roughly stable plateau the second hump with the amplitude larger than 0 9 in the region of 10 5 u r 15 9 afterwards a d n decreases abruptly and then gradually increases again after u r 18 6 exhibiting the third hump at s d 1 09 1 75 the galloping vibration were also observed by bokaian and geoola 1984b for the upstream cylinder with a fixed downstream cylinder the value of m ζ was 0 093 which is smaller than present study at s d 1 5 see fig 5 b a u n increases apparently till to a local peak and then decreases after that it remains convergent galloping vibration the behavior of upstream cylinder is similar to that in xu et al 2019 at s d 1 57 and borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 at s d 1 5 the a d n is still fluctuating along with three humps but it is clearly that the difference between a u n and a d n becomes smaller as observed by kim et al 2009 at s d 1 2 1 6 the upstream cylinder suffered a divergent galloping vibration while the amplitude of downstream cylinder was also unstable note that the maximum u r presented in their investigation was 12 at s d 1 3 which is smaller than the present research as armin et al 2018 reported the phase between the vibration responses of the two cylinders played a significant role on the amplitude responses because the vortices shedding from the upstream cylinder arrived to the rear one at random positions may amplify or minify the a d n fig 6 shows the phase angle ϕ between the two vibration cylinders as a function of reduced velocity u r at s d 1 2 and 1 5 it is evident that at s d 1 2 ϕ varies unsteadily along with two discontinuities at u r 6 4 and 10 5 which are just at the points of the occurrence of the local peaks for the first and second humps of the downstream cylinder for u r 10 5 the variation trend of ϕ is qualitatively similar to that of a d n the identical characteristic can also be observed for s d 1 5 which is not repeated here for brevity in order to have a better understanding of the above phenomenon and also observe the process of the vibrations more clearly fig 7 illustrates the instantaneous motions of the two cylinders including time history of cf displacements and their corresponding oscillation frequencies four representative reduced velocity u r 5 5 7 4 12 3 19 5 are chosen to present at s d 1 2 the left column fig 7 a d g and j displays the time history at each u r and the middle column fig 7 b e h and k displays a selected 2 s of the time history when the vibration is stable the oscillation frequencies of the corresponding signal are shown in the right column fig 7 c f i and l in each figure the upper curve presents the results of upstream cylinder and the lower signifies the downstream cylinder at u r 5 5 during the early moments the downstream cylinder achieves a large amplitude primarily and at the same time the amplitude of the upstream cylinder accelerating increases but after a certain time the oscillation amplitude of the rear one decreases and finally both cylinders almost reach the stable vibration simultaneously see in fig 7 a for u r 7 4 see in fig 7 d it is evident that the two cylinders present periodically unstable motions simultaneously beating phenomenon implying the interference between them is strong when u r increases to 12 3 see in fig 7 g the cylinders can eventually achieve stable vibrations after the early tens of seconds unsteady motions if further increasing u r to 19 5 see in fig 7 j both cylinders are directly able to obtain the steady state from rest without any unstable vibration during the early moments in general at very small u r the final instantaneous motions of the two cylinders are steady while within a certain region of u r they will suffer periodically unstable oscillations at last after that the final situations can change from periodically unstable to stable again it should be noted that the instantaneous motions of larger spacing ratios s d 2 0 are similar to that of u r 12 3 or 19 5 at s d 1 2 and will not be shown here for brevity as shown in fig 7 c f i and l the values of the oscillation frequencies maintain unchanged with f o 10 hz very close to the natural frequency at u r 5 5 12 3 and 19 5 if the cylinders experience a final stable vibration while for u r 7 4 when the cylinders suffer beating phenomenon periodically unstable oscillations there indeed exists a very low frequency with a very small magnitude not easy to discover in order to have a better visual presentation fig 8 consisting of local amplification frequency are presented to illustrate the frequency responses at representative reduced velocity u r 5 5 stable vibration and u r 7 4 beating vibration as can be observed from fig 8 at u r 7 4 it is evident that the responses of upstream and downstream cylinders consist of two frequency components one very low frequency about 0 02 with very small magnitude and one high frequency close to the natural frequency with very high magnitude while just one distinct peak can be found at u r 5 5 when both cylinders experience stable vibrations the beating phenomenon is very interesting and it is necessary to further discuss this phenomenon similar vibrations have been frequently observed for cylinders with two degrees of freedom cf and il direction in those of mittal and kumar 2001 huang and sworn 2011 armin et al 2018 etc it can also be observed by some investigators when the cylinder can only vibrate in cf direction in those of borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 and khalak and williamson 1999 borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 focused on the fiv of two tandem cylinders in cf direction at s d 1 5 with re 200 the beating phenomenon can be observed at u r 4 while at other u r the vibration can achieve a stable state but they did not explain this phenomenon in khalak and williamson 1999 they found that the phase angle ϕ slips periodically through 360 as a function of time when the beating phenomenon occurred quasi periodic as defined in their paper while it remained close to an approximately constant value without the slips through 360 when the vibration is approximately periodically stable periodic as defined in their paper the phase angles ϕ of the displacement responses of the two cylinders versus time are calculated by using the hilbert transform as shown in fig 9 it is evident that the phase angle ϕ as in the definition of khalak and williamson 1999 changes periodically through 360 which is associated with beating phenomenon but for the stable vibrations the phase angles remain close to an approximately constant value without the slips through 360 therefore the beating phenomenon can be attributed to the unstable phase angle jump between the two cylinders the shedding frequency ratios f s f n for downstream cylinder at s d 1 2 and 1 5 are depicted in fig 10 a and b respectively in the f s f n curve a change from blue to red stands for dominant peaks of normalized power spectral density psd the brighter means the higher power density as can be seen in fig 10 a s d 1 2 the value of f s f n is smaller than 1 0 and almost follows st 0 25 line for u r 3 7 before the onset of vibration this is similar to but larger than the stationary cylinder about 0 2 the result is consistent with the experimental results of igarashi 1981 and xu et al 2004 in the region of 3 7 u r 6 9 f s f n jumps to and maintains 1 0 where the amplitude response of the downstream cylinder experiences a hump and achieves a local peak implying the occurrence of viv for u r 6 9 the vortex shedding frequency f s can be locked to multiple harmonics of natural frequency f n the multiple harmonics usually indicate a violent vibration with complicated vortex shedding mode for example 2s 2p mode which have been observed by qin et al 2017 or t s mode by chen et al 2018 when galloping vibration takes place on the other hand the dominant value of f s f n changes with the increasing of u r implying the transition of vortex shedding mode may come up for example all of the first second and third harmonics occur predominantly in the region of 11 1 u r 14 4 suggesting a kind of vortex shedding mode while the third harmonic frequency presents predominantly at u r 20 2 may imply the dominant status of another vortex shedding mode similarly at s d 1 5 fig 10 b the shedding frequency ratio f s f n also changes distinctly with u r specifically speaking the f s is predominantly locked to the first harmonic of f n for 3 7 u r 10 5 the first and second harmonic for 10 5 u r 17 2 the first and third harmonic for 17 2 u r 19 4 and the third harmonic for u r 19 4 to present the variation of psd more clearly three representative reduced velocity u r 4 2 10 5 21 3 at s d 1 2 are chosen the transform of power intensity for different u r can be displayed in fig 11 in fig 11 a u r 4 2 only a first harmonic can be observed suggesting a 2s mode while at u r 21 3 the third harmonic frequency presents predominantly indicating a complicated vortex mode therefore this is in consistent with that presented in fig 10 4 1 2 vibration characteristics in regimeⅱ 1 5 s d 3 0 regime ⅱ is characterized by two separated vibration regions for both upstream and downstream cylinders as shown in fig 5 c in the first region at small u r a u n is greater than a d n while in the second region u r exceed a certain value a u n is smaller than a d n at s d 2 0 a u n suffers a viv response with a broader range of 4 6 u r 12 3 than that of the single cylinder 4 6 u r 8 7 and then remains zero until u r 14 1 for u r 14 1 it starts to vibrate again and maintains nearly a stable state with the maximum a u n 0 28 viv also occurs for the downstream cylinder at 4 6 u r 12 3 and a d n sharply increases to a very large amplitude oscillation with the maximum a d n 1 03 after the same onset of vibration of upstream cylinder it can be observed in fig 5 d s d 3 0 the viv regions of upstream and downstream cylinders narrow down to 4 6 u r 9 6 and almost consistent with the single cylinder at u r 11 4 the upstream cylinder presents a very weak vibration though a d n still rises while the rear one gradually increases and experiences a violent vibration we also called wake induced galloping wig vibration the wig is first pointed out by bokaian et al 1984a which has been introduced at the beginning it is different from the galloping vibration of the upstream cylinder at s d 1 2 and 1 5 though both present a violent vibration that is because the incoming flow past the upstream cylinder is uniform while the downstream cylinder will be affected by the wake of the front one rather than the uniform incoming flow therefore the wig can be attributed to the unsteady vortex structure interactions between the downstream cylinder and the vortex shedding from the upstream one whereas the galloping vibration for the upstream cylinder can be ascribed to the existence of a fixed downstream cylinder which will be discussed later it is worth noting that wig is also called other terminologies in the published literature such as interference galloping ruscheweyh et al 1992 wake galloping brika et al 1999 wake induced vibration wiv assi et al 2010 or just galloping qin et al 2017 fig 12 a and b depict f s f n as a function of u r for downstream cylinder at s d 2 0 and 3 0 respectively similarly two separated regions can also be identified from fig 12 a and b in the first region the vortex shedding frequency f s is locked to the first harmonic of f n whereas in the second region it is locked to multiple harmonics of f n between the two regions it follows a linear branch like a stationary cylinder implying the absence of vibration at s d 2 0 fig 12 a for u r 4 6 and 12 3 u r 14 1 f s f n with st 0 15 and 0 18 can be detected respectively because of the weak or no vibration viv appears over a broader range of 4 6 u r 12 3 with f s f n the violent vibration occurs for u r 14 1 with f s f n 2f n and 3f n the characteristic of vortex shedding frequency at s d 3 0 fig 12 b is similar to that of s d 2 0 except a narrow lock in region 4 6 u r 9 6 and a slight broader linear branch 9 6 u r 12 4 this can be attributed to that the downstream cylinder sharply increases to a very large amplitude oscillation at s d 2 0 nevertheless for s d 3 0 it gradually increases and the upstream cylinder presents weak vibration in the region of 9 6 u r 12 4 see in fig 5 c and d 4 1 3 vibration characteristics in regime ⅲ 3 0 s d 8 0 in regime ⅲ the upstream cylinder presents a typical viv with a limited resonance range just like a single cylinder which implies the downstream cylinder has no more influence on the front one while the downstream cylinder displays two regions including a viv and a wig region the two regions can be separated or combined as can be observed from fig 5 e f and g a d n in the wig region gradually decreases since the diminishing influence of upstream cylinder for example it decreases from 1 13d s d 4 0 to 0 45d s d 8 0 in fact it can be inferred that the downstream cylinder will be identical to a single cylinder beyond a critical large spacing ratio s d as well it is worthwhile mentioned that the a d n exhibits two peaks in the viv region see in fig 5 e for 4 2 u r 9 7 this can be ascribed to the influence of the vibrating state of upstream cylinder strong or weak which will be systematically discussed in section 4 4 fig 13 a b and c plot the vortex shedding frequency ratios f s f n for downstream cylinder at s d 4 0 6 0 and 8 0 respectively at s d 4 0 fig 13 a the value of f s f n equals 1 0 for 4 6 u r 9 7 indicating the occurrence of viv for u r 12 1 the wig of downstream cylinder takes place along with f s locked to multiple harmonics of f n it follows a linear branch between the two regions of u r this is consistent with the amplitude response a separated viv and wig shown in fig 5 e however as shown in fig 13 b s d 6 0 two distinct branches can be detected in the first branch the low branch the vortex shedding frequency f s remains equal to the natural frequency f n associating with a whole lock in region from 5 1 to the maximum u r in this experiment therefore in fig 5 f the viv region is combined with the wig region instead of separating at s d 4 0 and 8 0 while the other branch the high branch is distinctly following st 0 18 line which may correspond to the vortex shedding frequency from upstream cylinder or downstream cylinder or both as pointed out by assi et al 2010 note that for u r 12 3 the first branch has higher energy than the second branch implying the wake from the upstream cylinder is weak at s d 8 0 fig 13 c two branches can also be evidently observed comparing with the graph at s d 6 0 the first branch f s f n 1 is broken at 11 4 u r 15 9 for the absence of vibration leading to a separated viv and wig in amplitude response see in fig 5 g the vortex shedding frequencies for upstream cylinder at s d 4 0 6 0 and 8 0 are shown in fig 14 it is clear that the non dimensional frequencies f s f n of the upstream cylinder at s d 4 0 6 0 8 0 have the similar characteristic to the single elastically mounted cylinder there exists a lock in region with f s f n 1 and beyond the region they almost follow st 0 18 0 19 line this also can be revealed in fig 5 e f and g that the upstream cylinder presents a typical viv with a limited resonance range 4 1 4 the discussion of reliability and reproducibility of the results the occurrence of error is inevitable for an experimental study therefore it is necessary to discuss the reliability and reproducibility of the results fig 15 presents the test results a d of two times named test 1 and test 2 along with error bars for each test the representative spacing ratios s d 1 2 3 0 and 8 0 are chosen for brevity the bars represent the standard deviations achieved by the test data for each reduced velocity u r larger bars mean that the greater deviation of a d from cycle to cycle it can be observed from fig 15 that the standard deviations are relatively small especially when the vibration is very weak and the maximum value of the standard deviations occur at u r 7 4 for s d 1 2 when the cylinder suffer beating phenomenon see in fig 7 d this indicates that the vibrations are fairly regular and stable besides the occurrence of beating vibration the test results of two times are roughly the same except for only a few u r therefore present results have a good reliability and reproducibility and the value of a d can represent the actual vibrations of the cylinders 4 2 the response of oscillation frequency fig 16 shows the variation of dominant oscillation frequency ratios f o f n depending on s d and u r consisting of the results from xu et al 2019 for the upstream and downstream cylinders performed in the water tunnel for the present investigations using wind tunnel experiment unlike the characteristics of vortex shedding frequencies f s locked to the multiple harmonics of natural frequency f n it is evident that the dominant data collapse over f o f n 1 line independent of s d and u r this indicates the dominant oscillation frequencies can only be locked to the natural frequency f n in the whole time once the cylinders begin to vibrate under the experimental conditions in this paper more insights into the response of dominant oscillation frequency can be obtained by visiting fig 17 as shown in fig 17 the representative spacing ratios s d 1 2 and 1 5 are chosen to show the variation of psd of f o f n as a function of reduced velocity u r results show that the psd value of f o f n maintains one in the whole examined region which is in consistent with that presented in fig 16 while for the experimental results of xu et al 2019 the dominant oscillation frequencies f o for all four spacing ratios s d 1 57 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 stay above the natural frequency and roughly lower than the st 0 2 line the difference response can be ascribed to the mass ratio m as investigated by govardhan et al 2000 for the single cylinder the f o f n follows st 0 17 line with m 0 52 but f o will be locked to f n when m 10 3 suggesting that the mass ratio m plays a significant influence on the response of oscillation frequency the m in present study is 268 9 m 341 9g m a 1 27g and that in xu et al 2019 is 1 34 m 7286g m a 5245g where the m a is the value of added mass in still fluid it is evident that the actual mass of the cylinder is about three hundred times bigger than the added mass m a at present study in air however they are relatively close in xu et al 2019 in water the large m are evidently less affected by m a therefore the f o will roughly not change during the vibration with f o f n 1 in wind tunnel experiment however for small m in water the added mass m a may have a pronounced impact on the f o as a result the response of oscillation frequency f o in water will be changed and it is not always equal to f n 4 3 influence of different test initial conditions from rest and increasing velocity two test initial conditions from rest and increasing velocity are performed in the experiment for the two cylinders the procedure of from rest can be illustrated as following for each test the speed of incoming flow is started from 0 and at this time the cylinder is in the state of rest afterwards accelerate the speed up to the targeted value maintain the speed until the cylinder achieve a stable periodic vibration and then stop the wind tunnel motor when finish the test it can be obtained different reduced velocity by running the test at different velocities while the increasing velocity is to make the cylinders start to vibrate at the steady state amplitude produced by the previous u r and then continuously increasing to a new targeted u r without outside interference in order to have a better understanding of the procedure of different initial conditions a sample of time histories of from rest and increasing velocity at the same objective u r 14 1 at s d 4 0 are shown in fig 18 as can be seen from fig 18 the amplitude of cylinder is from 0 to a final stable periodic vibration for the case of from rest while for increasing velocity the cylinder starts to vibrate with an initial steady state amplitude produced by the previous u r 12 3 and then increases to a final stable periodic vibration how do the from rest and increasing velocity affect the vibration response the work in this section aims to address the above issue according to the s d that the three classified regimes at the compare of vibration responses for from rest and increasing velocity are shown in figs 19 21 respectively as observed from the graphs two vibration features can be identified at s d 1 2 3 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 the vibration trends of from rest are nearly the same to the case of increasing velocity for the both cylinders there exist no hysteresis phenomenon while at s d 1 5 and 2 0 two obviously different vibration trends and a hysteresis phenomenon for from rest and increasing velocity can be observed as a function of u r for the upstream cylinders at s d 1 5 fig 19 c both of them start to vibrate at u r 3 7 and a u n nearly follow the same trend until at u r 6 4 which approaches the point of the maximum amplitude for single cylinder after this u r 6 4 for the case of increasing velocity a u n continues to increase rapidly and undergoes a hump with a local peak of 0 91 at u r 8 7 and then gradually increases again after u r 10 5 maintaining a large convergent amplitude oscillation with maximum a u n 0 80 however for the case of from rest the absence of vibration takes place in the region of 6 4 u r 7 3 and then a u n sharply increases to 0 67 at u r 8 2 which is smaller than that of increasing velocity a u n 0 88 for u r 9 6 the a u n of from rest converges to that of increasing velocity again in fig 19 d s d 1 5 within the region of 6 4 u r 9 6 the downstream cylinders also suffer a hysteresis phenomenon which is characterized with two apparent branches under the two initial test conditions whereas beyond the region a d n of from rest keeps the same to that of increasing velocity the hysteresis phenomenon presented above can be attributed to the gap flow pointed out by zdravkovich 1974 1988 which is triggered by an initial displacement when two cylinders are proximal therefore for instance the upstream and downstream cylinders can not be excited to vibrate for the condition of from rest due to the stationary state at 6 4 u r 7 3 while the increasing velocity signifies an initial displacement together with a strong gap flow which will produce a large lift force to excite vibration this is good agreement with the investigations from zdravkovich 1974 and hu et al 2019 fig 20 a and b show the effect of different initial test conditions on the amplitude response of the two cylinders at s d 2 0 the regions of the occurrence of hysteresis phenomenon for upstream and downstream cylinders become smaller implying the diminished effect of gap flow between the two cylinders if further increase s d 3 0 there will be no more hysteretic in the vibration amplitude response since the spacing ratio is large enough and the gap flow disappears gradually see in fig 21 it is interesting that there also exists no hysteresis phenomenon at s d 1 2 see in fig 19 a and b though the spacing ratio is smaller than 1 5 and 2 0 the underlying mechanism will be explained and discussed in section 4 4 to illustrate the characteristics of vibration amplitude response further the non dimensional vortex shedding frequency f s f n for from rest at s d 1 5 the occurrence of hysteresis phenomenon and 3 0 no hysteresis phenomenon are chosen to present for brevity fig 22 depicts f s f n for the case of from rest as a function of u r at s d 1 5 similar to the different amplitude vibration patterns shown in fig 19 c and d the curves of f s f n for the two initial test conditions exhibit distinctively various trends in the region of 6 4 u r 7 3 as well when the hysteresis phenomenon happens in comparison with the result of increasing velocity see in fig 10 b the value of f s f n for from rest follows a linear branch like a stationary cylinder consistent with the absence of vibration at 6 4 u r 7 3 at s d 3 0 by comparing figs 12 b and fig 23 the graph of f s f n for increasing velocity is same to that of from rest indicating the vortex shedding modes have no difference between them therefore there exist no hysteresis phenomenon and the vibration amplitude responses are nearly identical in summary different vibration amplitude responses can be observed at s d 1 5 and 2 0 for the two initial test conditions from rest and increasing velocity used in the current experiment which is indicative of a hysteresis phenomenon that is at some given u r or re the vibrations of cylinders are depended on whether they are vibrating or stationary on the other hand with the increasing of s d 3 0 the difference of vibration trend can be negligible which can be attributed to the gradually decreasing influence of gap flow as a result the occurrence of hysteresis is depended on the initial conditions and spacing ratio s d 4 4 influence of initial state fixed or elastically mounted of the neighbouring cylinder the initial states fixed or elastically mounted of the neighbouring cylinder may be exerted different influence on the vibration amplitude response of the other one the experiment is carried out by keeping one of the cylinders fixed or elastically mounted while the other cylinder can vibrate freely just as kim et al 2009 stated investigating this issue is very significant from an engineering point of view hence three spacing ratios s d 1 2 3 0 and 8 0 representing in regimes ⅰ ⅱ ⅲ are selected to examine the impact of initial states of one cylinder on the other one respectively the results are presented in fig 24 the left column of the figure fig 24 a c and e compares the vibration amplitude response of upstream cylinder when the downstream cylinder is fixed black quadrate symbol or elastically mounted red quadrate symbol similarly the right fig 24 b d and f is the vibration data of the downstream cylinder when the upstream cylinder under different initial states the black circular symbol represents fixed and the red circular symbol is elastically mounted as obviously shown in fig 24 a and b s d 1 2 in regime ⅰ the response characteristic of upstream cylinder is qualitatively same when the downstream cylinder from fixed to elastically mounted other than a variation in amplitude this suggests that the upstream cylinder undergoes galloping vibration just because the existence of a proximal downstream cylinder and nothing to do with the state of the downstream cylinder therefore the hysteresis phenomenon is absence at s d 1 2 in fig 19 a and b the galloping vibration was also observed by bokaian et al 1984b for the upstream cylinder with a fixed downstream cylinder by using a water tunnel and they emphasized that the essential factor for the occurrence of galloping was that the rear cylinder is well inside the near wake of the front one while unlike the fluctuating of a d n as the upstream cylinder is in the state of elastically mounted the downstream cylinder increases sharply at u r 4 2 and achieves two stable platforms with the maximum a d n 0 89 the first platform and 1 29 the second platform respectively when the upstream cylinder is fixed from the above observation it can be implied that regardless of fixed or not the interference influence of the downstream cylinder on the upstream is very weak while the initial states of the upstream cylinder play a significant effect on the downstream cylinder vibration response in regime ⅱ s d 3 0 as the downstream cylinder is fixed the response of the upstream cylinder is similar to that of a single cylinder with a limited resonance region whereas a u n still increases slowly for u r 11 4 when the downstream cylinder is not fixed the observation from fig 24 c suggests that the downstream cylinder still has a small impact on the upstream cylinder so it is able to excite the motion of the upstream cylinder once the downstream can vibrate freely on the other hand when the upstream cylinder is fixed fig 24 d the response of a d n is similar to the vibrating upstream cylinder except a variation in the region of the existence of viv indicating that the interference of the upstream cylinder on the downstream is very small in this regime at s d 8 0 in regime ⅲ the variations of a u n can be negligible under the two initial states of downstream cylinder fig 24 e implying the rear cylinder has no more influence on the upstream cylinder based on fig 24 f as the upstream cylinder is fixed it can be found that the downstream cylinder present two humps with two peaks in the viv region 4 6 u r 12 3 but outside the region the a d n differs very slightly from the vibrating upstream cylinder the same phenomenon two humps can be also observed at s d 4 0 6 0 in regime ⅲ fig 5 e and f this can be attributed to the sudden change of vortex shedding frequency f s when the upstream cylinder from stationary to vibration for the case of stationary upstream cylinder the f s ust d depends on the incoming velocity u where st is the strouhal number with the value of 0 2 on the other hand once the upstream cylinder is able to vibrate in the lock in region the f s will be locked to the natural frequency of the upstream cylinder along with 2s or 2p mode according to the value of reduced velocity u r and do not vary with the incoming velocity u therefore that is why the inflection point between the two humps occurs at the onset or end of vibration of upstream cylinder from what has been discussed above it is worthwhile mentioned that the effect of the initial states of the neighbouring cylinder on the other cylinder is different from one regime to another for regimes ⅰ ii and iii with the increasing of spacing ratio s d 5 conclusions the cross flow vibrations of two identical elastically mounted cylinders in tandem arrangement are experimentally investigated using a low turbulence wind tunnel the parameters contain spacing ratio s d 1 2 8 0 reduced velocity u r 2 4 25 0 and reynolds number re 4000 42000 results are presented in the form of amplitude response oscillation frequency f o and vortex shedding frequency f s the research covers four aspects i e a preliminary test for the single cylinder the particularly studied on the vibration characteristics of the two cylinders depend on s d and u r for increasing velocity the influence of initial test conditions from rest and increasing velocity on the vibration responses of the two cylinders the influence of initial states fixed or elastically mounted of the neighbouring cylinder on the other one based on the presented results and discussions several conclusions can be summarized as following depended on the characteristics of vibration three regimes can be classified in regime ⅰ s d 1 5 the upstream cylinder experiences galloping vibration while the amplitude of downstream cylinder a d n undergoes fluctuating with multiple peaks versus u r and the amplitude of upstream cylinder a u n is roughly greater than a d n in regime ⅱ 1 5 s d 3 0 it is characterized by two separated vibration regions for both upstream and downstream cylinders in the first region a u n is greater than a d n while in the second region a u n is smaller than a d n in regime ⅲ 3 0 s d 8 0 the upstream cylinder presents a typical viv just like a single cylinder while the downstream cylinder displays two regions including a viv and a wig region the two regions can be separated or combined for the influence of from rest and increasing velocity an obvious hysteresis phenomenon of vibration responses can be observed at s d 1 5 and 2 0 while at s d 3 0 the hysteresis phenomenon can be negligible the effect of the initial states of the neighbouring cylinder on the other cylinder is different from one regime to another for instance in regimes ⅰ the initial states of the upstream cylinder play a pronounced effect on the downstream cylinder while the influence of the downstream cylinder exerts on the upstream is very weak in regime ⅱ the initial states of the downstream cylinder have small influence on the front one and the upstream cylinder show weak effect on the rear one as well the f s is also influenced by s d and u r in regimes ⅰ f s can be locked to multiple harmonics of natural frequency f n during the galloping vibration and the dominant value of f s f n changes with the increasing of u r in regimes ii two separated regions can be identified consistent with the amplitude responses in the first region f s is locked to the first harmonic of f n whereas in the second region it is locked to multiple harmonics of f n in regimes iii two distinct branches can be detected in the first branch f s remains equal to f n while the other branch is distinctly following st 0 18 line unlike the characteristics of f s the features of f o are obviously different between low mass ratio and high mass ratio the dominant f o can only be locked to the f n in the whole time once the cylinders begin to vibrate for high mass ratio while it will stay above the f n and roughly lower than st 0 2 line for low mass ratio credit authorship contribution

21781,in this paper cross flow vibrations of two identical elastically mounted circular cylinders in tandem arrangement have been investigated in a wind channel at reynolds number re 4000 42000 the spacing ratios s d are from 1 2 to 8 0 the vibration amplitude oscillation frequency f o and vortex shedding frequency f s are investigated based on the vibration characteristics three regimes can be

introduction vortex induced vibration viv of an isolated circular cylinder free to vibrate in the cross flow cf direction has been made great achievements in the past decades a number of significant phenomena and conclusions have been revealed by previous investigators one can refer to the reviews by bearman 1984 parkinson 1989 blevins 1990 sarpkaya 2004 and williamson and govardhan 2004 however there are many multiple cylindrical structures applied in practical engineering such as risers offshore platforms tubes of heat exchangers bridge cables high voltage transmission lines etc as the most basic and simplest configuration of multiple cylindrical structures the studies on a two cylinder system are of fundamental and practical significance early experiments mainly focusing on the fluid flow of structures have been performed many on two stationary cylinders zdravkovich 1987 1988 classified the flow pattern of two staggered arrangement cylinders into three regimes no interference regime where the downstream cylinder is far apart from the upstream one there is no effect on each other just like a single cylinder proximity interference is the region where the downstream cylinder is close enough to suffer interference from the flow deflected by the upstream cylinder but is not immersed in its wake finally when the downstream cylinder is immersed in the wake of the upstream cylinder partially or completely it is called the wake interference igarashi 1981 carried out experimental investigations on the characteristics of the flow around two tandem stationary cylinders he presented a detailed classification of the flow structure depended on spacing ratios s d from 1 03d to 5d and re from 8 7 103 to 5 2 104 zhou and yiu 2006 performed a series of similar experiments the flow structure can be generally classified into three regimes depended on s d and re i extended body regime in this regime the two cylinders are sufficiently close that the shear layers generated from upstream cylinder overshoot downstream cylinder just like a single body ii reattached regime where the separated shear layers can reattach on the downstream cylinder iii co shedding regime the distance between the cylinders is sufficiently far apart that the separated shear layers from the upstream cylinder roll up and vortex streets can be formed in the gap and behind the rear cylinder some related reviews on this topic can be found in zdravkovich 1988 sumner 2010 zhou and alam 2016 flow induced vibration fiv of one fixed one free tandem arrangement cylinders has been studied by a large number of investigators and some excellent findings have been achieved in this regime the upstream cylinder is fixed and the rear one can freely vibrate in the cf direction bokaian and geoola 1984a investigated the fiv of two rigid cylinders arranged in tandem by performing water channel experiments mass ratio m 8 4 damping ratio ζ 0 013 it was found that depending on s d m and ζ the downstream cylinder exhibited four dynamic regimes galloping only vortex resonance vr only separated vr and galloping and combined vr and galloping brika and laneville 1999 carried out experiment to investigate the vibration response of a flexible cylinder in the wake of a stationary one using wind tunnel under the conditions of re 5000 27000 s d 6 5 24 5 m 821 ζ 0 00008 the spacing ratio s d presented a significant influence on the dynamic response of the rear flexible cylinder with the increasing of s d the vibration amplitude decreased and it could be inferred that the response would resemble that of an isolated cylinder when s d was larger than a critical value hover and triantafyllou 2001 performed an experiment with an elastically mounted downstream cylinder towed behind an identical fixed one for 4 75 diameters in water in their experiment re 30000 m 3 0 and ζ 0 04 the vibration amplitude increased monotonically as a function of reduced velocity u r and reached the maximum amplitude a max d 1 9 at u r 17 assi et al 2010 investigated the mechanism of wake induced vibrations wiv of two cylinders in a tandem arrangement m 2 6 and ζ 0 007 they suggested that wiv could be attributed to the unsteady vortex structure interactions between the downstream cylinder and the vortex shedding from the upstream body a combined viv and wiv can be observed in the experiment at s d 6 0 while with the increasing of s d the vibration response tending to a single cylinder qin et al 2017 experimental investigated the fiv of a elastically mounted cylinder with larger diameter d placed behind a fixed one with a smaller diameter d where the d d 0 2 1 0 and s d 1 0 5 5 they noted that the large scale vibration is more likely to occur at smaller d d as s d increases the fiv characteristics become more complicated when the two cylinders can both vibrate freely kim et al 2009 carried out a series of experiments to investigate the free vibration response of two rigid cylinders in cf using wind tunnel the system had a mass damping ratio m ζ of 0 65 and s d was from 1 1 to 4 2 companied with reduced velocity u r 1 5 26 depending on s d and vibration characteristics different amplitude response regimes can be observed the vibration was absent at 1 1 s d 1 2 and 3 0 s d 3 7 both cylinders suffered violent galloping response at 1 2 s d 1 6 for u r 6 at 1 6 s d 3 0 the convergent vibration could be observed around u r 6 7 at s d 3 7 each cylinder resembled a single cylinder since the spacing ratio s d is far enough however the vortex shedding frequency was not examined in their experiment huear huarte and bearman 2011 performed experiments on the dynamic responses of two flexible cylinders in tandem arrangement using water tunnel m ζ 0 043 s d 2 0 4 0 the upstream cylinder presented larger vibration than the downstream cylinder at s d 2 0 2 5 for u r 4 9 while for large spacing ratio s d 3 0 4 0 the downstream cylinder exhibited non classical viv with violent vibration at high u r huear huarte and gharib 2011 further studied the responses at s d 4 0 8 0 far wake interference it can be demonstrated that the upstream cylinder displayed a typical viv behavior similar to a single cylinder while the rear one presented wiv with large amplitude even though the u r beyond the classical lock in region when the s d was large enough huang and herfjord 2013 investigated the fiv of two elastically mounted rigid cylinders in staggered and tandem arrangement they found that the motion trajectories of the downstream cylinder were depended on whether the two cylinders were in tandem or staggered arrangement they also discussed the influence of the local reduced velocity for downstream cylinder on the its own vibration response the local reduced velocity was not measured but estimated by a wake velocity model by using a towing tank armin et al 2018 performed experiments on the responses of two tandem elastically mounted cylinders with reynolds numbers ranging from 8 7 103 to 5 2 104 the cylinders can vibrate in both in line il and cross flow cf direction and the spacing ratios s d were set from 3 5d to 20d they found that for all spacing ratios the upstream cylinder undergone viv response which was similar to the single cylinder however the downstream cylinder was significantly influenced by the front one and the s d another important phenomenon was that the two cylinders vibrated at different frequencies which was contrary to the previous conclusions on the fixed one qin et al 2018 carried out a series of experiments to study the cf vibration of two tandem cylinders with six different natural frequencies 0 6 0 8 1 0 1 2 1 4 1 6 two spacing ratios s d 1 5 2 0 were chosen to analysis base on the natural frequency ratios and reduced velocity three regimes can be distinguished no lock in vortex excitation galloping regimes xu et al 2019 presented experimental results of two elastically mounted tandem cylinders in cf direction by using a water tunnel with m ζ 0 027 at re 28600 11400 four spacing ratios s d 1 57 2 57 3 57 4 57 were chosen in their experiment results indicated that the vibration amplitude frequency response and total fluid force coefficient of upstream cylinder were similar to those of an isolated cylinder at higher spacing ratio s d 2 57 3 57 4 57 for u r 12 while at s d 1 57 it presented galloping response with a divergent amplitude vibration the downstream cylinder experienced viv like response with wider lock in region for all the spacing ratios tested in their experiment except experimental investigations on the fiv of two elastically mounted tandem cylinders there exist a number of numerical simulations focusing on this topic as well most of them carried out at low re such as mittal and kumar 2001 papaioannou et al 2008 prasanth and mittal 2009 borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 wang et al 2017 papaioannou et al 2008 studied the effect of s d on the vibration response of two tandem cylinders in two degrees of freedom at re 160 for m ζ 0 127 three spacing ratios s d 2 5 3 5 and 5 were selected it can be observed that the viv region of the upstream cylinder was sensitive to s d and it became wider at smaller s d attributing to the shielding effect the response curves of the rear were shifted toward higher values of u r than those of upstream cylinder for all examined s d borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 focused on the fiv of two tandem cylinders with one and two degrees of freedom in the near wake interference region s d 1 5 at re 200 two vibration situations could be illustrated at low u r the vibration amplitude of the upstream cylinder was greater than that of the rear one while once u r increased to a critical value the downstream cylinder would undergo violent vibration with larger amplitude than that of the front one wang et al 2017 investigated the viv of two tandem flexible cylinders using a two way fluid structure interaction fsi method the simulations were performed for re 500 at three spacing ratios s d 2 5 3 5 5 0 with m 10 and ζ 0 it was observed that the upstream cylinder presented a typical viv response for all s d examined the downstream cylinder was also similar to the typical viv at small spacing ratios while when the spacing was large enough that the shear layers from the upstream cylinder can roll up in the gap it experienced wiv with a large amplitude at high u r lin et al 2020 numerically investigated the fiv of two tandem elastically mounted cylinders at subcritical reynolds numbers with s d 4 0 they found that the variation of the vortex shedding frequency of the upstream cylinder had a weak influence on the amplitude and dominant frequency of the rear one and the fiv characteristics of the downstream cylinder presented a significant dependence on the reynolds number fiv of two elastically mounted tandem arrangement cylinders is influenced by a number of parameters such as spacing ratio s d mass damping ratio m ζ reynolds number re and initial test conditions used in the experiment therefore despite performing a number of experimental and numerical studies in the past on this field some issues are still needed to be conducted to have a better understanding for example what are the responses including vibration amplitude oscillation frequency and vortex shedding frequency with a mass damping ratio m ζ 0 2 in air which is usually larger than that in water how do the initial test conditions from rest and increasing velocity used in the experiment affect the vibration response and whether there existing a hysteresis phenomenon what is the underlying mechanism of hysteresis phenomenon and why it only occurs at some small s d how does the initial state of the neighbouring cylinder fixed or elastically mounted affect the amplitude response of the other one here this paper aims to address the above issues the spacing ratio s d varied from 1 2 to 8 0 from proximal to far wake two initial test conditions from rest and increasing velocity are used in the experiment i from rest regime the cylinder is released from rest at any given u r with human intervention ii increasing velocity regime the cylinder starts to vibrate at a steady state amplitude produced by the previous and continuously increasing u r without outside interference the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the experimental set up is described experimental methodology validation and preliminary results for a single cylinder are given in section 3 section 4 presents the results and discussions for the two identical elastically mounted cylinders the conclusion of the work is shown in section 5 2 experimental details the experiments were carried out in a low speed wind tunnel with a test section of 0 6 m in width 0 6 m in height and 2 0 m in length the turbulent strength scale is less than 0 2 further details of the wind tunnel were introduced by gu et al 2012 sui et al 2016 and liang et al 2018 two hollow cylinders are horizontally mounted in tandem arrangement fig 1 a in the test section with outer diameter d 50 mm and inner diameter d 48 mm the length of each cylinder is 540 mm with aspect ratio of 10 8 and blockage of 7 5 approximately the cylinders are made of plexiglass to keep low mass and excellent smoothness each cylinder was supported by four spiral springs made of stainless steel respectively at each side eight spiral springs used in total and can only vibrate in the cf direction fig 1 b the free stream velocity was in the range of 1 2 m s 12 5 m s in the current test with the corresponding reynolds number 4000 42000 and u r 2 4 25 0 the mass ratios m of the upstream and downstream cylinders are both 268 9 in order to measure the damping ratios ζ and natural frequency f n a series of free decay experiments were conducted in still air that is the cylinder is excited to oscillate freely by giving an initial displacement the free decay duration curve is presented in fig 2 a the value of damping ratios ζ is estimated to be 0 00075 and as a result the combined mass damping ratio m ζ can be yielded 0 20 the value of natural frequency f n is 10 05 hz which can be determined by fast fourier transform fft on the basis of free decay experimental displacement data fig 2 b the displacement responses y of the upstream and downstream cylinders were measured utilizing a laser sensor il 300 keyence after the vibrations stabilizes the oscillation frequencies of the cylinders can be obtained via fft based on the measured displacement data the streamwise fluctuating velocities u were measured through a hot wire probe named hw dantec 55p11 which was placed behind the downstream cylinder as shown in fig 1 b the horizontal and vertical distances between the hot wire probe and downstream cylinder remain unchanged 4d in horizontal and 1d in vertical though s d varying the sampling rate is set to be 1024hz and the majority sampling duration used for calculation is 20 s when the cylinder achieves the stable vibration for few special cases which fail to achieve a steady state beating phenomenon shown in fig 7 d longer time will be used 3 experimental methodology validation and preliminary results to verify the experimental methodology and ensure the characteristics of the upstream and downstream cylinders being identical separated tests for the two cylinders were preliminarily performed the non dimensional amplitude responses a d of present experimental results versus reduced velocity u r together with the past outstanding researches for comparison are shown in fig 3 and fig 3 b plots the vortex shedding frequencies f s for the separated upstream and downstream cylinders at present study particularly the amplitude a is calculated by multiplying the root mean square r m s value of displacement signal y by 2 when the vibration is stable as shown in fig 3 a and b the vibration amplitude responses and vortex shedding frequency ratios are nearly the same implying both cylinders are strictly identical to each other two typical branches initial and lower branches can be observed the viv region lock in region occurs at around u r 4 6 8 7 associated with f s f n 1 and the maximum value of vibration amplitude occurs at around u r 6 0 once beyond the range the vibration is weak and f s f n almost follows st 0 19 line which is very close to 0 2 when the cylinder is stationary these characteristics are in good agreement to the previous results in wind tunnel with large m ζ such as feng 1968 sui et al 2016 and liang et al 2018 while an upper branch with very large amplitude is presented in the experiments by armin et al 2018 and huang and herfjord 2013 for small m ζ in water tunnel and the lock in regions are also wider this can be mainly attributed to the influence of mass damping ratio m ζ the non dimensional maximum amplitudes a max d are displayed in fig 4 as a function of m ζ including several experimental data carried out by previous investigators such as zhou et al 2011 and assi et al 2013 etc the blue line represents a curve fitting to the results of a large number of previous researches compiled originally by griffin 1980 and updated after by skop et al 1997 as can be seen from the graph the current result can fit the curve well therefore the present method is well validated by an experiment of classical single cylinder for high m ζ in wind tunnel 4 results and discussion the cf vibration characteristics of two elastically mounted cylinders in tandem arrangement are systematically investigated primarily under the initial condition of increasing velocity depending on spacing ratio s d and reduced velocity u r the results are presented including non dimensional vibration amplitude a d oscillation frequency f o and vortex shedding frequency f s and then the influence of initial test conditions from rest and increasing velocity on the vibration responses of the two cylinders and the influence of initial states fixed or elastically mounted of the neighbouring cylinder on the other one are studied and discussed respectively 4 1 vibration characteristics depending on s d fig 5 illustrates the non dimensional amplitudes of the upstream a u n and downstream cylinders a d n versus u r depending on s d comparing to that of the single cylinder in fig 3 the vibration amplitude responses are more complicated it is evident that the amplitudes are really sensitive to s d and u r based on the vibration characteristics of the two cylinders three regimes can be classified 4 1 1 vibration characteristics in regimeⅰ s d 1 5 in this regime the upstream cylinder experiences galloping vibration while a d n undergoes fluctuating with multiple peaks as a function of u r and a u n is roughly greater than a d n during the whole range of examined u r at s d 1 2 see fig 5 a both of them start to vibrate at around u r 3 7 earlier than that of the single cylinder and maintain nearly the same trend until at u r 5 1 after that a u n still increases rapidly as the u r gets larger and achieves a peak of about 1 4 at u r 18 5 generally speaking a u n is rising with the increasing of u r indicating the occurrence of galloping vibration even though along with a slight fluctuation whereas a d n achieves the first hump with a local peak at u r 6 4 which is very closed to the point of the maximum amplitude takes place for the single cylinder and then continues to increase rapidly and undergoes a roughly stable plateau the second hump with the amplitude larger than 0 9 in the region of 10 5 u r 15 9 afterwards a d n decreases abruptly and then gradually increases again after u r 18 6 exhibiting the third hump at s d 1 09 1 75 the galloping vibration were also observed by bokaian and geoola 1984b for the upstream cylinder with a fixed downstream cylinder the value of m ζ was 0 093 which is smaller than present study at s d 1 5 see fig 5 b a u n increases apparently till to a local peak and then decreases after that it remains convergent galloping vibration the behavior of upstream cylinder is similar to that in xu et al 2019 at s d 1 57 and borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 at s d 1 5 the a d n is still fluctuating along with three humps but it is clearly that the difference between a u n and a d n becomes smaller as observed by kim et al 2009 at s d 1 2 1 6 the upstream cylinder suffered a divergent galloping vibration while the amplitude of downstream cylinder was also unstable note that the maximum u r presented in their investigation was 12 at s d 1 3 which is smaller than the present research as armin et al 2018 reported the phase between the vibration responses of the two cylinders played a significant role on the amplitude responses because the vortices shedding from the upstream cylinder arrived to the rear one at random positions may amplify or minify the a d n fig 6 shows the phase angle ϕ between the two vibration cylinders as a function of reduced velocity u r at s d 1 2 and 1 5 it is evident that at s d 1 2 ϕ varies unsteadily along with two discontinuities at u r 6 4 and 10 5 which are just at the points of the occurrence of the local peaks for the first and second humps of the downstream cylinder for u r 10 5 the variation trend of ϕ is qualitatively similar to that of a d n the identical characteristic can also be observed for s d 1 5 which is not repeated here for brevity in order to have a better understanding of the above phenomenon and also observe the process of the vibrations more clearly fig 7 illustrates the instantaneous motions of the two cylinders including time history of cf displacements and their corresponding oscillation frequencies four representative reduced velocity u r 5 5 7 4 12 3 19 5 are chosen to present at s d 1 2 the left column fig 7 a d g and j displays the time history at each u r and the middle column fig 7 b e h and k displays a selected 2 s of the time history when the vibration is stable the oscillation frequencies of the corresponding signal are shown in the right column fig 7 c f i and l in each figure the upper curve presents the results of upstream cylinder and the lower signifies the downstream cylinder at u r 5 5 during the early moments the downstream cylinder achieves a large amplitude primarily and at the same time the amplitude of the upstream cylinder accelerating increases but after a certain time the oscillation amplitude of the rear one decreases and finally both cylinders almost reach the stable vibration simultaneously see in fig 7 a for u r 7 4 see in fig 7 d it is evident that the two cylinders present periodically unstable motions simultaneously beating phenomenon implying the interference between them is strong when u r increases to 12 3 see in fig 7 g the cylinders can eventually achieve stable vibrations after the early tens of seconds unsteady motions if further increasing u r to 19 5 see in fig 7 j both cylinders are directly able to obtain the steady state from rest without any unstable vibration during the early moments in general at very small u r the final instantaneous motions of the two cylinders are steady while within a certain region of u r they will suffer periodically unstable oscillations at last after that the final situations can change from periodically unstable to stable again it should be noted that the instantaneous motions of larger spacing ratios s d 2 0 are similar to that of u r 12 3 or 19 5 at s d 1 2 and will not be shown here for brevity as shown in fig 7 c f i and l the values of the oscillation frequencies maintain unchanged with f o 10 hz very close to the natural frequency at u r 5 5 12 3 and 19 5 if the cylinders experience a final stable vibration while for u r 7 4 when the cylinders suffer beating phenomenon periodically unstable oscillations there indeed exists a very low frequency with a very small magnitude not easy to discover in order to have a better visual presentation fig 8 consisting of local amplification frequency are presented to illustrate the frequency responses at representative reduced velocity u r 5 5 stable vibration and u r 7 4 beating vibration as can be observed from fig 8 at u r 7 4 it is evident that the responses of upstream and downstream cylinders consist of two frequency components one very low frequency about 0 02 with very small magnitude and one high frequency close to the natural frequency with very high magnitude while just one distinct peak can be found at u r 5 5 when both cylinders experience stable vibrations the beating phenomenon is very interesting and it is necessary to further discuss this phenomenon similar vibrations have been frequently observed for cylinders with two degrees of freedom cf and il direction in those of mittal and kumar 2001 huang and sworn 2011 armin et al 2018 etc it can also be observed by some investigators when the cylinder can only vibrate in cf direction in those of borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 and khalak and williamson 1999 borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 focused on the fiv of two tandem cylinders in cf direction at s d 1 5 with re 200 the beating phenomenon can be observed at u r 4 while at other u r the vibration can achieve a stable state but they did not explain this phenomenon in khalak and williamson 1999 they found that the phase angle ϕ slips periodically through 360 as a function of time when the beating phenomenon occurred quasi periodic as defined in their paper while it remained close to an approximately constant value without the slips through 360 when the vibration is approximately periodically stable periodic as defined in their paper the phase angles ϕ of the displacement responses of the two cylinders versus time are calculated by using the hilbert transform as shown in fig 9 it is evident that the phase angle ϕ as in the definition of khalak and williamson 1999 changes periodically through 360 which is associated with beating phenomenon but for the stable vibrations the phase angles remain close to an approximately constant value without the slips through 360 therefore the beating phenomenon can be attributed to the unstable phase angle jump between the two cylinders the shedding frequency ratios f s f n for downstream cylinder at s d 1 2 and 1 5 are depicted in fig 10 a and b respectively in the f s f n curve a change from blue to red stands for dominant peaks of normalized power spectral density psd the brighter means the higher power density as can be seen in fig 10 a s d 1 2 the value of f s f n is smaller than 1 0 and almost follows st 0 25 line for u r 3 7 before the onset of vibration this is similar to but larger than the stationary cylinder about 0 2 the result is consistent with the experimental results of igarashi 1981 and xu et al 2004 in the region of 3 7 u r 6 9 f s f n jumps to and maintains 1 0 where the amplitude response of the downstream cylinder experiences a hump and achieves a local peak implying the occurrence of viv for u r 6 9 the vortex shedding frequency f s can be locked to multiple harmonics of natural frequency f n the multiple harmonics usually indicate a violent vibration with complicated vortex shedding mode for example 2s 2p mode which have been observed by qin et al 2017 or t s mode by chen et al 2018 when galloping vibration takes place on the other hand the dominant value of f s f n changes with the increasing of u r implying the transition of vortex shedding mode may come up for example all of the first second and third harmonics occur predominantly in the region of 11 1 u r 14 4 suggesting a kind of vortex shedding mode while the third harmonic frequency presents predominantly at u r 20 2 may imply the dominant status of another vortex shedding mode similarly at s d 1 5 fig 10 b the shedding frequency ratio f s f n also changes distinctly with u r specifically speaking the f s is predominantly locked to the first harmonic of f n for 3 7 u r 10 5 the first and second harmonic for 10 5 u r 17 2 the first and third harmonic for 17 2 u r 19 4 and the third harmonic for u r 19 4 to present the variation of psd more clearly three representative reduced velocity u r 4 2 10 5 21 3 at s d 1 2 are chosen the transform of power intensity for different u r can be displayed in fig 11 in fig 11 a u r 4 2 only a first harmonic can be observed suggesting a 2s mode while at u r 21 3 the third harmonic frequency presents predominantly indicating a complicated vortex mode therefore this is in consistent with that presented in fig 10 4 1 2 vibration characteristics in regimeⅱ 1 5 s d 3 0 regime ⅱ is characterized by two separated vibration regions for both upstream and downstream cylinders as shown in fig 5 c in the first region at small u r a u n is greater than a d n while in the second region u r exceed a certain value a u n is smaller than a d n at s d 2 0 a u n suffers a viv response with a broader range of 4 6 u r 12 3 than that of the single cylinder 4 6 u r 8 7 and then remains zero until u r 14 1 for u r 14 1 it starts to vibrate again and maintains nearly a stable state with the maximum a u n 0 28 viv also occurs for the downstream cylinder at 4 6 u r 12 3 and a d n sharply increases to a very large amplitude oscillation with the maximum a d n 1 03 after the same onset of vibration of upstream cylinder it can be observed in fig 5 d s d 3 0 the viv regions of upstream and downstream cylinders narrow down to 4 6 u r 9 6 and almost consistent with the single cylinder at u r 11 4 the upstream cylinder presents a very weak vibration though a d n still rises while the rear one gradually increases and experiences a violent vibration we also called wake induced galloping wig vibration the wig is first pointed out by bokaian et al 1984a which has been introduced at the beginning it is different from the galloping vibration of the upstream cylinder at s d 1 2 and 1 5 though both present a violent vibration that is because the incoming flow past the upstream cylinder is uniform while the downstream cylinder will be affected by the wake of the front one rather than the uniform incoming flow therefore the wig can be attributed to the unsteady vortex structure interactions between the downstream cylinder and the vortex shedding from the upstream one whereas the galloping vibration for the upstream cylinder can be ascribed to the existence of a fixed downstream cylinder which will be discussed later it is worth noting that wig is also called other terminologies in the published literature such as interference galloping ruscheweyh et al 1992 wake galloping brika et al 1999 wake induced vibration wiv assi et al 2010 or just galloping qin et al 2017 fig 12 a and b depict f s f n as a function of u r for downstream cylinder at s d 2 0 and 3 0 respectively similarly two separated regions can also be identified from fig 12 a and b in the first region the vortex shedding frequency f s is locked to the first harmonic of f n whereas in the second region it is locked to multiple harmonics of f n between the two regions it follows a linear branch like a stationary cylinder implying the absence of vibration at s d 2 0 fig 12 a for u r 4 6 and 12 3 u r 14 1 f s f n with st 0 15 and 0 18 can be detected respectively because of the weak or no vibration viv appears over a broader range of 4 6 u r 12 3 with f s f n the violent vibration occurs for u r 14 1 with f s f n 2f n and 3f n the characteristic of vortex shedding frequency at s d 3 0 fig 12 b is similar to that of s d 2 0 except a narrow lock in region 4 6 u r 9 6 and a slight broader linear branch 9 6 u r 12 4 this can be attributed to that the downstream cylinder sharply increases to a very large amplitude oscillation at s d 2 0 nevertheless for s d 3 0 it gradually increases and the upstream cylinder presents weak vibration in the region of 9 6 u r 12 4 see in fig 5 c and d 4 1 3 vibration characteristics in regime ⅲ 3 0 s d 8 0 in regime ⅲ the upstream cylinder presents a typical viv with a limited resonance range just like a single cylinder which implies the downstream cylinder has no more influence on the front one while the downstream cylinder displays two regions including a viv and a wig region the two regions can be separated or combined as can be observed from fig 5 e f and g a d n in the wig region gradually decreases since the diminishing influence of upstream cylinder for example it decreases from 1 13d s d 4 0 to 0 45d s d 8 0 in fact it can be inferred that the downstream cylinder will be identical to a single cylinder beyond a critical large spacing ratio s d as well it is worthwhile mentioned that the a d n exhibits two peaks in the viv region see in fig 5 e for 4 2 u r 9 7 this can be ascribed to the influence of the vibrating state of upstream cylinder strong or weak which will be systematically discussed in section 4 4 fig 13 a b and c plot the vortex shedding frequency ratios f s f n for downstream cylinder at s d 4 0 6 0 and 8 0 respectively at s d 4 0 fig 13 a the value of f s f n equals 1 0 for 4 6 u r 9 7 indicating the occurrence of viv for u r 12 1 the wig of downstream cylinder takes place along with f s locked to multiple harmonics of f n it follows a linear branch between the two regions of u r this is consistent with the amplitude response a separated viv and wig shown in fig 5 e however as shown in fig 13 b s d 6 0 two distinct branches can be detected in the first branch the low branch the vortex shedding frequency f s remains equal to the natural frequency f n associating with a whole lock in region from 5 1 to the maximum u r in this experiment therefore in fig 5 f the viv region is combined with the wig region instead of separating at s d 4 0 and 8 0 while the other branch the high branch is distinctly following st 0 18 line which may correspond to the vortex shedding frequency from upstream cylinder or downstream cylinder or both as pointed out by assi et al 2010 note that for u r 12 3 the first branch has higher energy than the second branch implying the wake from the upstream cylinder is weak at s d 8 0 fig 13 c two branches can also be evidently observed comparing with the graph at s d 6 0 the first branch f s f n 1 is broken at 11 4 u r 15 9 for the absence of vibration leading to a separated viv and wig in amplitude response see in fig 5 g the vortex shedding frequencies for upstream cylinder at s d 4 0 6 0 and 8 0 are shown in fig 14 it is clear that the non dimensional frequencies f s f n of the upstream cylinder at s d 4 0 6 0 8 0 have the similar characteristic to the single elastically mounted cylinder there exists a lock in region with f s f n 1 and beyond the region they almost follow st 0 18 0 19 line this also can be revealed in fig 5 e f and g that the upstream cylinder presents a typical viv with a limited resonance range 4 1 4 the discussion of reliability and reproducibility of the results the occurrence of error is inevitable for an experimental study therefore it is necessary to discuss the reliability and reproducibility of the results fig 15 presents the test results a d of two times named test 1 and test 2 along with error bars for each test the representative spacing ratios s d 1 2 3 0 and 8 0 are chosen for brevity the bars represent the standard deviations achieved by the test data for each reduced velocity u r larger bars mean that the greater deviation of a d from cycle to cycle it can be observed from fig 15 that the standard deviations are relatively small especially when the vibration is very weak and the maximum value of the standard deviations occur at u r 7 4 for s d 1 2 when the cylinder suffer beating phenomenon see in fig 7 d this indicates that the vibrations are fairly regular and stable besides the occurrence of beating vibration the test results of two times are roughly the same except for only a few u r therefore present results have a good reliability and reproducibility and the value of a d can represent the actual vibrations of the cylinders 4 2 the response of oscillation frequency fig 16 shows the variation of dominant oscillation frequency ratios f o f n depending on s d and u r consisting of the results from xu et al 2019 for the upstream and downstream cylinders performed in the water tunnel for the present investigations using wind tunnel experiment unlike the characteristics of vortex shedding frequencies f s locked to the multiple harmonics of natural frequency f n it is evident that the dominant data collapse over f o f n 1 line independent of s d and u r this indicates the dominant oscillation frequencies can only be locked to the natural frequency f n in the whole time once the cylinders begin to vibrate under the experimental conditions in this paper more insights into the response of dominant oscillation frequency can be obtained by visiting fig 17 as shown in fig 17 the representative spacing ratios s d 1 2 and 1 5 are chosen to show the variation of psd of f o f n as a function of reduced velocity u r results show that the psd value of f o f n maintains one in the whole examined region which is in consistent with that presented in fig 16 while for the experimental results of xu et al 2019 the dominant oscillation frequencies f o for all four spacing ratios s d 1 57 2 57 3 57 and 4 57 stay above the natural frequency and roughly lower than the st 0 2 line the difference response can be ascribed to the mass ratio m as investigated by govardhan et al 2000 for the single cylinder the f o f n follows st 0 17 line with m 0 52 but f o will be locked to f n when m 10 3 suggesting that the mass ratio m plays a significant influence on the response of oscillation frequency the m in present study is 268 9 m 341 9g m a 1 27g and that in xu et al 2019 is 1 34 m 7286g m a 5245g where the m a is the value of added mass in still fluid it is evident that the actual mass of the cylinder is about three hundred times bigger than the added mass m a at present study in air however they are relatively close in xu et al 2019 in water the large m are evidently less affected by m a therefore the f o will roughly not change during the vibration with f o f n 1 in wind tunnel experiment however for small m in water the added mass m a may have a pronounced impact on the f o as a result the response of oscillation frequency f o in water will be changed and it is not always equal to f n 4 3 influence of different test initial conditions from rest and increasing velocity two test initial conditions from rest and increasing velocity are performed in the experiment for the two cylinders the procedure of from rest can be illustrated as following for each test the speed of incoming flow is started from 0 and at this time the cylinder is in the state of rest afterwards accelerate the speed up to the targeted value maintain the speed until the cylinder achieve a stable periodic vibration and then stop the wind tunnel motor when finish the test it can be obtained different reduced velocity by running the test at different velocities while the increasing velocity is to make the cylinders start to vibrate at the steady state amplitude produced by the previous u r and then continuously increasing to a new targeted u r without outside interference in order to have a better understanding of the procedure of different initial conditions a sample of time histories of from rest and increasing velocity at the same objective u r 14 1 at s d 4 0 are shown in fig 18 as can be seen from fig 18 the amplitude of cylinder is from 0 to a final stable periodic vibration for the case of from rest while for increasing velocity the cylinder starts to vibrate with an initial steady state amplitude produced by the previous u r 12 3 and then increases to a final stable periodic vibration how do the from rest and increasing velocity affect the vibration response the work in this section aims to address the above issue according to the s d that the three classified regimes at the compare of vibration responses for from rest and increasing velocity are shown in figs 19 21 respectively as observed from the graphs two vibration features can be identified at s d 1 2 3 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 the vibration trends of from rest are nearly the same to the case of increasing velocity for the both cylinders there exist no hysteresis phenomenon while at s d 1 5 and 2 0 two obviously different vibration trends and a hysteresis phenomenon for from rest and increasing velocity can be observed as a function of u r for the upstream cylinders at s d 1 5 fig 19 c both of them start to vibrate at u r 3 7 and a u n nearly follow the same trend until at u r 6 4 which approaches the point of the maximum amplitude for single cylinder after this u r 6 4 for the case of increasing velocity a u n continues to increase rapidly and undergoes a hump with a local peak of 0 91 at u r 8 7 and then gradually increases again after u r 10 5 maintaining a large convergent amplitude oscillation with maximum a u n 0 80 however for the case of from rest the absence of vibration takes place in the region of 6 4 u r 7 3 and then a u n sharply increases to 0 67 at u r 8 2 which is smaller than that of increasing velocity a u n 0 88 for u r 9 6 the a u n of from rest converges to that of increasing velocity again in fig 19 d s d 1 5 within the region of 6 4 u r 9 6 the downstream cylinders also suffer a hysteresis phenomenon which is characterized with two apparent branches under the two initial test conditions whereas beyond the region a d n of from rest keeps the same to that of increasing velocity the hysteresis phenomenon presented above can be attributed to the gap flow pointed out by zdravkovich 1974 1988 which is triggered by an initial displacement when two cylinders are proximal therefore for instance the upstream and downstream cylinders can not be excited to vibrate for the condition of from rest due to the stationary state at 6 4 u r 7 3 while the increasing velocity signifies an initial displacement together with a strong gap flow which will produce a large lift force to excite vibration this is good agreement with the investigations from zdravkovich 1974 and hu et al 2019 fig 20 a and b show the effect of different initial test conditions on the amplitude response of the two cylinders at s d 2 0 the regions of the occurrence of hysteresis phenomenon for upstream and downstream cylinders become smaller implying the diminished effect of gap flow between the two cylinders if further increase s d 3 0 there will be no more hysteretic in the vibration amplitude response since the spacing ratio is large enough and the gap flow disappears gradually see in fig 21 it is interesting that there also exists no hysteresis phenomenon at s d 1 2 see in fig 19 a and b though the spacing ratio is smaller than 1 5 and 2 0 the underlying mechanism will be explained and discussed in section 4 4 to illustrate the characteristics of vibration amplitude response further the non dimensional vortex shedding frequency f s f n for from rest at s d 1 5 the occurrence of hysteresis phenomenon and 3 0 no hysteresis phenomenon are chosen to present for brevity fig 22 depicts f s f n for the case of from rest as a function of u r at s d 1 5 similar to the different amplitude vibration patterns shown in fig 19 c and d the curves of f s f n for the two initial test conditions exhibit distinctively various trends in the region of 6 4 u r 7 3 as well when the hysteresis phenomenon happens in comparison with the result of increasing velocity see in fig 10 b the value of f s f n for from rest follows a linear branch like a stationary cylinder consistent with the absence of vibration at 6 4 u r 7 3 at s d 3 0 by comparing figs 12 b and fig 23 the graph of f s f n for increasing velocity is same to that of from rest indicating the vortex shedding modes have no difference between them therefore there exist no hysteresis phenomenon and the vibration amplitude responses are nearly identical in summary different vibration amplitude responses can be observed at s d 1 5 and 2 0 for the two initial test conditions from rest and increasing velocity used in the current experiment which is indicative of a hysteresis phenomenon that is at some given u r or re the vibrations of cylinders are depended on whether they are vibrating or stationary on the other hand with the increasing of s d 3 0 the difference of vibration trend can be negligible which can be attributed to the gradually decreasing influence of gap flow as a result the occurrence of hysteresis is depended on the initial conditions and spacing ratio s d 4 4 influence of initial state fixed or elastically mounted of the neighbouring cylinder the initial states fixed or elastically mounted of the neighbouring cylinder may be exerted different influence on the vibration amplitude response of the other one the experiment is carried out by keeping one of the cylinders fixed or elastically mounted while the other cylinder can vibrate freely just as kim et al 2009 stated investigating this issue is very significant from an engineering point of view hence three spacing ratios s d 1 2 3 0 and 8 0 representing in regimes ⅰ ⅱ ⅲ are selected to examine the impact of initial states of one cylinder on the other one respectively the results are presented in fig 24 the left column of the figure fig 24 a c and e compares the vibration amplitude response of upstream cylinder when the downstream cylinder is fixed black quadrate symbol or elastically mounted red quadrate symbol similarly the right fig 24 b d and f is the vibration data of the downstream cylinder when the upstream cylinder under different initial states the black circular symbol represents fixed and the red circular symbol is elastically mounted as obviously shown in fig 24 a and b s d 1 2 in regime ⅰ the response characteristic of upstream cylinder is qualitatively same when the downstream cylinder from fixed to elastically mounted other than a variation in amplitude this suggests that the upstream cylinder undergoes galloping vibration just because the existence of a proximal downstream cylinder and nothing to do with the state of the downstream cylinder therefore the hysteresis phenomenon is absence at s d 1 2 in fig 19 a and b the galloping vibration was also observed by bokaian et al 1984b for the upstream cylinder with a fixed downstream cylinder by using a water tunnel and they emphasized that the essential factor for the occurrence of galloping was that the rear cylinder is well inside the near wake of the front one while unlike the fluctuating of a d n as the upstream cylinder is in the state of elastically mounted the downstream cylinder increases sharply at u r 4 2 and achieves two stable platforms with the maximum a d n 0 89 the first platform and 1 29 the second platform respectively when the upstream cylinder is fixed from the above observation it can be implied that regardless of fixed or not the interference influence of the downstream cylinder on the upstream is very weak while the initial states of the upstream cylinder play a significant effect on the downstream cylinder vibration response in regime ⅱ s d 3 0 as the downstream cylinder is fixed the response of the upstream cylinder is similar to that of a single cylinder with a limited resonance region whereas a u n still increases slowly for u r 11 4 when the downstream cylinder is not fixed the observation from fig 24 c suggests that the downstream cylinder still has a small impact on the upstream cylinder so it is able to excite the motion of the upstream cylinder once the downstream can vibrate freely on the other hand when the upstream cylinder is fixed fig 24 d the response of a d n is similar to the vibrating upstream cylinder except a variation in the region of the existence of viv indicating that the interference of the upstream cylinder on the downstream is very small in this regime at s d 8 0 in regime ⅲ the variations of a u n can be negligible under the two initial states of downstream cylinder fig 24 e implying the rear cylinder has no more influence on the upstream cylinder based on fig 24 f as the upstream cylinder is fixed it can be found that the downstream cylinder present two humps with two peaks in the viv region 4 6 u r 12 3 but outside the region the a d n differs very slightly from the vibrating upstream cylinder the same phenomenon two humps can be also observed at s d 4 0 6 0 in regime ⅲ fig 5 e and f this can be attributed to the sudden change of vortex shedding frequency f s when the upstream cylinder from stationary to vibration for the case of stationary upstream cylinder the f s ust d depends on the incoming velocity u where st is the strouhal number with the value of 0 2 on the other hand once the upstream cylinder is able to vibrate in the lock in region the f s will be locked to the natural frequency of the upstream cylinder along with 2s or 2p mode according to the value of reduced velocity u r and do not vary with the incoming velocity u therefore that is why the inflection point between the two humps occurs at the onset or end of vibration of upstream cylinder from what has been discussed above it is worthwhile mentioned that the effect of the initial states of the neighbouring cylinder on the other cylinder is different from one regime to another for regimes ⅰ ii and iii with the increasing of spacing ratio s d 5 conclusions the cross flow vibrations of two identical elastically mounted cylinders in tandem arrangement are experimentally investigated using a low turbulence wind tunnel the parameters contain spacing ratio s d 1 2 8 0 reduced velocity u r 2 4 25 0 and reynolds number re 4000 42000 results are presented in the form of amplitude response oscillation frequency f o and vortex shedding frequency f s the research covers four aspects i e a preliminary test for the single cylinder the particularly studied on the vibration characteristics of the two cylinders depend on s d and u r for increasing velocity the influence of initial test conditions from rest and increasing velocity on the vibration responses of the two cylinders the influence of initial states fixed or elastically mounted of the neighbouring cylinder on the other one based on the presented results and discussions several conclusions can be summarized as following depended on the characteristics of vibration three regimes can be classified in regime ⅰ s d 1 5 the upstream cylinder experiences galloping vibration while the amplitude of downstream cylinder a d n undergoes fluctuating with multiple peaks versus u r and the amplitude of upstream cylinder a u n is roughly greater than a d n in regime ⅱ 1 5 s d 3 0 it is characterized by two separated vibration regions for both upstream and downstream cylinders in the first region a u n is greater than a d n while in the second region a u n is smaller than a d n in regime ⅲ 3 0 s d 8 0 the upstream cylinder presents a typical viv just like a single cylinder while the downstream cylinder displays two regions including a viv and a wig region the two regions can be separated or combined for the influence of from rest and increasing velocity an obvious hysteresis phenomenon of vibration responses can be observed at s d 1 5 and 2 0 while at s d 3 0 the hysteresis phenomenon can be negligible the effect of the initial states of the neighbouring cylinder on the other cylinder is different from one regime to another for instance in regimes ⅰ the initial states of the upstream cylinder play a pronounced effect on the downstream cylinder while the influence of the downstream cylinder exerts on the upstream is very weak in regime ⅱ the initial states of the downstream cylinder have small influence on the front one and the upstream cylinder show weak effect on the rear one as well the f s is also influenced by s d and u r in regimes ⅰ f s can be locked to multiple harmonics of natural frequency f n during the galloping vibration and the dominant value of f s f n changes with the increasing of u r in regimes ii two separated regions can be identified consistent with the amplitude responses in the first region f s is locked to the first harmonic of f n whereas in the second region it is locked to multiple harmonics of f n in regimes iii two distinct branches can be detected in the first branch f s remains equal to f n while the other branch is distinctly following st 0 18 line unlike the characteristics of f s the features of f o are obviously different between low mass ratio and high mass ratio the dominant f o can only be locked to the f n in the whole time once the cylinders begin to vibrate for high mass ratio while it will stay above the f n and roughly lower than st 0 2 line for low mass ratio credit authorship contribution

21782,amongst the floating systems catering to the offshore wind energy barge floater is the simplest structure but its limitation of application is constrained by its large motion mitigating these motions can help in efficient and economical production of energy the present work focuses on the experiments conducted on a 1 50 scaled model of a barge without and with static offshore wind turbine owt with active gyrostabilizer off and on condition for regular and irregular waves for three different rpms the roll responses were recorded for a range of regular wave heights from 2 cm to 5 5 cm and time periods varying from 0 8 to 1 3 s and irregular waves with significant wave height from 3 cm to 5 cm with peak period ranging from 0 8 to 1 25 s for barge the maximum motion reduction observed was 60 and for barge fitted with static owt the maximum reduction observed was 55 at higher rpm in regular waves in case of irregular waves significant response heights were compared for

energy because of its many advantages over other renewable energy resources offshore wind energy has been the focus of some regions worldwide and is being harvested due to its advantages jacket monopole and gravity based structures are used as a substructure to support the wind turbine superstructures these structures are limited to the shallow depth of 20 m 50 m due to material and installation cost the floating substructures like spar tension leg platform tlp semisubmersibles and barge are more suitable in deeper waters barge supported owt is the simplest and has a large box shaped barge floating structure to support owt with catenary moorings connected to the seabed barge structure achieves stability through buoyancy and large water plane area jonkman 2013 substation dealing with storage and distribution of electrical energy is integral part of the barge which requires a separate deck it is also possible to have a separate barge as an isolated floating substation stobbe and ole 2019 along with the floater supporting owt though barges have a minimum complexity of design fabrication transit and fitting are prone to wave induced angular motions compared to other types of floating substructures these oscillatory motions of the barge are to be limited for effective operations of the owt which calls for using suitable motion control devices many of the motion stabilization in ships aims at controlling roll motions and can be achieved through passive and active types of stabilizers bilge keels anti roll tanks movement of solid weights are few examples under passive type active controls include active roll tanks active fin stabilizers rudder roll stabilization and gyrostabilizers by using gyrostabilizers in ships the roll damping are achieved through gyroscopic counteracting moment that is created by the precession of heavy flywheel that rotates at higher angular velocity bhattacharyya 1978 with regard to control of motions on offshore wind turbine supported by barge structures different techniques are being explored control techniques used in the wind turbine structures include blade pitch controller hybrid mass damper and active vane controllers and these are mounted on the nacelle and rotor blades however these mountings tend to affect the aerodynamic performance of the turbine to avoid this drawback stabilization devices on substructures such as active and passive tuned mass damper tmd liquid column damper lcd and ball vibration absorber bva etc can be used on the floater to mitigate the motions among the traditional ship roll stabilizers gyrostabilizer has potential advantage in stabilizing the motions in a short time interval besides excluding the complexity of fluid structure interaction as it is mounted inside the vessel by using gyrostabilizers ships roll reduction up to 60 has been achieved for a 41 000 ton displacement italian luxury liner gillmer and johnson 1982 82 for navy patrol vessel using halcyon s twin gyrostabilizer perez and steinmann 2009 and 70 roll reduction in yachts using anti rolling gyro arg by mitsubishi takeuchi et al 2011 in recent years the gyrostabilizer development has been increased in the yacht industries for roll damping with veemgyro steinmann 2019 as well as seakeeper seakeeper 2019 achieving roll motion reduction to the extent of 95 hence this gyrostabilizer can be explored to control the barge angular motions and make it suitable for offshore floating substation and to support owt this paper presents on the details of the experimental studies carried out on a 1 50 scaled model of iti barge to mitigate the angular motions of barge type floating substations and barge fitted with a scaled model of offshore static owt structure with active gyrostabilizer subjected to the range of regular and irregular wave excitations 1 1 literature review as far as stabilization techniques concerned jonkman 2013 studied the influence of control on the angular motion

skerrett 1915 tea 1932 roitenberg 1960 presented the theory of gyrostabilizer and its engineering application on naval ships and monorails state of the art research on gyrostabilizer for ocean applications was discussed by townsend et al 2007 who introduced a gyroscopic method of active ride control on marine vehicles perez and steinmann 2009 presented the modeling of gyrostabilizer with

rolling gyro arg 375t used in superyachts by mitsubishi heavy industries ltd perez and blanke 2012 discussed the roll damping of the ship by various stabilization devices including gyrostabilizer townsend and shenoi 2012 discussed a gyroscopic wave energy recovery system generating power and motion stabilization of the marine vessels they also investigated the nonlinear dynamics of a single gimbal gyroscopic energy harvester excited by a harmonic moment about two axes simultaneously townsend and shenoi 2013 besides examining the passive derivative based reaction wheel and unrestricted gimbal control strategies for a marine gyrostabilizer system townsend and shenoi 2014 from the literature review theories on experimental modeling of potential applications of the gyroscope on actual systems to control motions are limited the performance of active gyrostabilizer to control the motion of a barge and barge with floating offshore wind turbine fixed has not been experimentally studied widely and forms the motivation of this work and investigation 2 gyroscope and motion control gyrostabilizer gyro is a device that is also used to control the motions of the vessel where it is attached the most common parts of gyrostabilizer are the flywheel gimbal frame motor and stand fig 1 shows the schematic picture of single axis gyrostabilizer here the flywheel is just a spinning mass rotated by means of a motor around its axis and remains parallel to it and oppose any change in its orientation by external forces by installing a flywheel on gimbals that allow the mass to navigate freely in the three directions of space its spinning axis will remain oriented in the same direction even if the gimbal frame changes direction precession and nutation which are closely related are a few of the physical phenomena associated with a gyroscope when a constant external moment respectively a constant angular speed is applied to the mass its rotation axis undergoes a precession motion at a constant angular speed respectively with a constant output moment in a direction that is normal to the direction of the applied external moment in fig 1 z axis is the spinning axis and when an external moment is applied about y axis the gimbal frame with flywheel will precess about the x axis gyrostabilizer works based on the principle of the law of conservation of angular momentum and large moment can be generated when the flywheel is constrained in rotational motion once the gyro is attached to the vessel the stabilizing moment against the roll motion is generated by the following process the waves induce a rolling moment which causes the vessel to roll angular motion about y axis precession motion about the x axis is created due to roll motion of floater combining with the spinning flywheel combination of precession motion and spinning flywheel create the stabilizing moment this is shown schematically in fig 2 and forms the fundamentals of gyro dynamics based on the flywheel spin axis gyrostabilizers are classified as horizontal axis gyrostabilizer hag and vertical axis gyrostabilizer vag also based on control of precession motion they are classified as passive and active gyrostabilizers fig 2 a and b shows the schematic of vag and hag respectively the vag and hag differ in the axis spinning of the flywheel and the precession in vag flywheel spins about z axis and precess about the x axis see fig 2 a and in hag flywheel spins about x axis with precession about z axis see fig 2 b when the body is displaced a counteracting moment is generated resulting in motion reduction the hag has many disadvantages compared to the vag the horizontal spinning axis does not allow the use of natural precession precession of gimbal without any actuator mechanism for external torque due to slewing ring type bearings that are mostly used for tilting rotating large mass with spinning object in the horizontal plane the usage of such bearing does not allow natural precission due to the excessive resistance of the slewing ring type bearings and requires that the precession motion to be driven to overcome this resistance fig 2 c shows the schematic of active gyrostabilizer by using active adaptive precession control systems the gyros efficiency is increased for a wide range of conditions without needing to tune by an operator steinmann 2014 therefore active gyrostabilizer is opted for motion stabilization of barge and barge with static offshore floating wind turbine 2 1 uncoupled and coupled equation of motion for gyro and barge fig 3 shows the coordinates of the active gyro and barge coupled system let oxyz be the coordinate system of the gimbal and oxyz is the coordinate system of the barge in the equilibrium position the principal axes oxyz of the gimbal with flywheel coincide with the axes oxyz of the platform during operation of gyro the precession angle α of the gimbal relative to the ox axis is called the output angle and ψ is the spin angle 2 1 1 uncoupled eom of gyro the equation of motion of single axis active gyrostabilizer about the output angle is given by townsend and shenoi 2014 1 i g s α b g s α c g s α l φ c o s α where i g s is the moment of inertia of the orbiting flywheel along the precession axis b g s is the damping coefficient due to friction in unsteady movement of bearing inner ring from side to side

wave generated roll exciting moment in more refined model these coefficients are actually frequency dependent 2 1 3 coupled system barge with gyrostabilizer the equation of motion of a single axis gyro stabilized floating barge for the roll motion can be expressed as 3 i r φ b r φ c r φ m φ m g s where m g s n l α c o s α is the reactional moment n is the number of the flywheel n 1 for this experimental study and the equation of motion of active gyrostabilizer with precession controlled moment τ p about the precession axis of gimbal along with the flywheel is given by 4 i g s α b g s α c g s α l φ c o s α τ p eqs 3 and 4 are valid for roll angle up to 1 rad perez and steinmann 2009 3 scaled model particulars 3 1 scaling scheme to evaluate the behavior of the prototype structure and to reproduce its response of the offshore structure that will be exhibited at the operational offshore site a scaled model test should be conducted using appropriate scaling laws for wave structure interaction problem in ocean engineering the most important non dimensionless numbers that govern the scaling laws are froude fr reynolds re keulegan carpernter kc and strouhal st among this re scaling is used for fluid flow problems where viscous force is an important criterion kc model is used for drag dominated problem st relates to vortex shedding and the fr for the inertia dominated environment oscillatory motions of the iti barge are dominant due to the excitation created by the gravity waves on the inertia of the barge hence froude law is used to scale down the barge prototype for angular motion studies with gyrostabilizer in a wave flume the ratio of inertia force to the gravitational force is the froude number and is given by chakrabarti 2005 5 f r i n e r t i a f o r c e s g r a v i t y f o r c e s v 2 g d where v is the velocity of the system g is the gravity and d is the characteristic length of the system the prototype to scaled model relation with scale factor is given by 6 n p λ n m where n is the parameter to be scaled p is the prototype m is the model and λ is the scale factor the chosen scale of the model was constrained by the wave flume dimensions and water depth the testing wave flume supports 1 50 or less model scale of iti barge model and the larger scale will lead to an increase in overall gyrostabilizer system cost with design and fabrication difficulties hence a 1 50 scaled model of iti energy barge and barge with static owt as offshore floating wind turbine was chosen for the study 3 2 design and fabrication of scale model 3 2 1 floater the salient details of the complete model are given in tables 1 and 2 table 1 shows the geometric properties of the prototype and the scaled model hydrostatic properties of experimental models are

stainless steel and aluminium the gyrostabilizer was designed based on the barge geometric specification limitation such as height length and breadth the flywheel was fabricated using stainless steel with the 11 cm outer diameter and 4 cm thickness the vacuum chamber model of flywheel arrangement in industrial use for energy harvesting is avoided due to the space restriction of occupancy and to reduce the model complication the flywheel was grooved to make hollow with an inner diameter of 7 2 cm from the bottom to 3 3 cm on the top and remaining 0 7 cm was kept to hold the motor that rotates the flywheel flywheel inner edge at the bottom was filleted to make the wiring process easy for the flywheel motor fig 6 shows the details and schematic design of flywheel and gimbal frame the dismantable gimbal channel frame for creating the precession motion along with flywheel to develop stabilizing moment in the gyrostabilizer was fabricated using high strength aluminium al7075 t6 with dimension 180 80 10 mm a motor hub of radius 45 mm and height 20 mm was fixed on the centre of the lower frame to hold the stator part of the brushless dc bldc motor the flywheel was attached to the rotor part of the bldc motor with m3 align screw having less friction between the motor shaft and flywheel both the sides of the gimbal frame had a hollow circular shaft extension 14 mm dia and 2 mm thick with 25 mm length on one side and 40 mm long on the other side servo actuator was attached to the shorter circular shaft extension and the other longer extension was used for housing the wiring for the motor the whole gimbal frame along with flywheel was attached to a vertical stand made of aluminium al7075 t6 through ntn shielded deep groove ball bearing 6803zzcm 5k the bearing arrangement on the stand transfers the gyroscopic moment from the gimbal and counteracts the exciting moment on the floater the whole arrangement of the gimbal with vertical stand is fitted in the plywood of dimension 400 400 150 mm with aluminium l angle and clearance is kept in such a way that gimbal can precess freely without any contact disturbance gyrostabilizer platform was fitted in the centre of the barge such that the gimbal axis is perpendicular to beam sea condition continuous rotational servo motor savox sc 1256tg was connected to the short extension shaft of gimbal frame to actuate the gimbal arrangement with a flywheel for an active precession motion of gyrostabilizer based on the angular disturbance of the platform the shaft rotates about precession axis with 90 clockwise and anticlockwise based on the controller signal the geometric and physical details of the gyrostabilizer are given in table 3 and the schematic diagram of gyrostabilizer along with the fabricated model

microcontroller connected to the personal computer that can be accessed through mission planner graphical user interface gui open source software bldc motor and servo actuator were controlled by pulse width modulation pwm signal through a microcontroller fig 8 shows the operating scheme layout of gyrostabilizer fitted inside the barge for motion reduction operating scheme of gyrostabilizer is as follows 1 the microcontroller is powered through usb via pc and it is accessed through the mission planner gui 2 the power supply is given to the esc to power up the flywheel bldc motor and servo actuator by dc power supply 3 the flywheel is toggled to attain a targeted rpm angular velocity by manually adjusting the joystick of the transmitter which intern send the command to the microcontroller board which will transmit the pwm signal to the motor through the esc 4 once the targeted rpm is attained the model is subjected to waves in the wave flume and the corresponding angular motion of the platform is measured by the mems gyro sensor 5 based on the measured signal from the sensor the microcontroller board will send the pwm signal to the servo actuator to actuate the gimbal frame forth and back about the precession axis for precession motion 6 reaction moment called stabilizing moment is created due to the precession motion of the gimbal frame and the moment is transferred to the platform to counteract the exciting moment created by the waves the sequence of scheme 4 6 is repeated to achieve motion reduction 4 experiments on scaled models different

instrumentation calibration and control a resistant type wave probe which was connected to the wavemeter was used to measure the wave elevation wave probe was calibrated manually by immersing a known length inside a water column to measure the output in volts from a series of these values the calibration constant was obtained as 16 1 cm per volt two axis inclinometer psital fraba was used to measure the platform roll response due to unidirectional excited waves it was calibrated manually by giving a known amount of inclination and the output in volts was measured from a series of these values the calibration constant was found to be 40 per volt with an accuracy of 0 1 the angular velocity of the bldc motor which rotates gyrostabilizer flywheel was also calibrated a known input dc voltage was given and the resulting revolution per minute rpm was measured using tachometer and the flywheel speed calibration test results are shown in fig 11 from the figure the calibration constant is obtained as 380 rpm v state and state derivative feedback proportional derivative pd controller was used for actuating gimbal frame precession motion to establish gyroscopic moment to counteract the roll motion of the floating model the pd controller is given by perez and steinmann 2009 7 τ p p α q α where α is the precession angle α is the precession rate p 4 is the state feedback gain and q 0 2 is the state derivative feedback gain adopted for all the test cases with gyrostabilizer on condition these constants were obtained by trial and error method the servo motor restricted the maximum precision angle of gimbal to 57 3 i e 1 rad perez and steinmann 2009 5 free oscillation tests free oscillation test was conducted in the wave flume for roll degree of freedom of scaled down model of iti energy barge and iti energy barge fitted with scaled owt floating rigid barge with and without the turbine along with gyrostabilizer in off condition was given as initial angular displacement and then released the resulting decay time series was recorded and from the time series the damped natural frequency ω d 2 π f d period t d 2 π ω d and damping ratio ζ were estimated the damping ratio was obtained by the logarithmic decrement method averaging over successive cycles the non dimensional damping coefficient and circular frequency is given by chakrabarti 2005 8 ζ 1 2 π ln φ a i φ a i 1 φ a i 2 φ a i 3 ω n ω d 1 ζ 2 where φ a i φ a i 1 etc represent roll amplitude separated over a period of t d free oscillation time series for the above mentioned conditions are shown in fig 12 and the parameters obtained from the plots are given in table 4 6 forced oscillation tests experiments on a floating barge with and without static owt with gyrostabilizer on and off conditions were tested in the wave flume elaborate experiments were carried for different cases as shown in fig 9 regular and irregular waves were generated for 35 s for barge alone and 30 s for barge fitted with static owt the data measuring system consists of wave probe with a wave meter to measure the generated wave data inclinometer to measure the angular oscillatory motions of the model data recording system consists of hbm spider8 with 8 channels was connected to the personal computer pc equipped with catman data acquisition daq software the wave and dynamic response of the model were recorded for barge and barge fitted with owt with a sampling rate of 150 hz 6 1 regular wave environment for barge alone and barge fitted with static owt responses were measured under regular waves at zero degrees heading for a range of wave heights and wave periods the test matrix for the regular wave experiments is shown in table 5 the models have been subjected to the wave periods of which are above below and near the natural period of the model for each wave height waves were generated and resulting roll motions were recorded the roll motion is represented by non dimensional transfer function as response amplitude divided by wave steepness as recommended by the ittc and is termed as roll response amplitude operator rrao denoted by 9 r r a o φ ˆ φ a k ζ a where φ a is the roll amplitude and k ζ a is the wave steepness of the corresponding regular harmonic wave the steady state response time series were used to obtain the rao s motions of the barge alone and barge fitted with a static owt case were recorded for gyro on and off conditions the gyrostabilizer switched on condition study was tested with base flywheel angular velocity of 4560 rpm 12v for which noticeable roll motion damping was observed the gyroscopic moment which damps the angular motion of the barge is given by 10 τ g y r o l ω p l i g s ω s p i n where ω p is the precession rate of the gyro in order to increase the gyroscopic moment rate further either one has to increase the angular momentum of the flywheel or the precession rate of the gimbal increase in precession rate is restricted by the servo actuator limitation and the only option is to increase the angular momentum here the effect of the increase in angular momentum on roll motion damping was studied for three different velocities by varying the dc voltage viz 12v 4560 rpm 13v 4940 rpm and 14v 5320 rpm responses with gyro off were compared with the responses of gyrostabilizer on condition for these three rpm cases to investigate the potential of blockage effects few cases of experiments of the wave flume were repeated in a wave basin of 30 m 30 m 3 m the time series showed a reasonable match and it is concluded that the blockage effects are marginal 6 2 irregular wave environment iti energy barge was designed and developed by the department of naval architecture and marine engineering at the universities of glasgow and strathclyde for north sea conditions represented by jonswap spectrum vijfhuizen 2008 besides some of the indian coast the sea state can be modeled by jonswap spectrum hence jonswap spectrum has been selected to

were recorded for the gyro off and on condition for barge with gyro on condition experiments were carried for three different rpms of the flywheel 4560 rpm 4940 rpm and 5320 rpm also for a barge with static owt with gyro on condition experiments were carried for three different rpms of the flywheel 4940 rpm 5320 rpm and 5700 rpm irregular wave response with gyro off were compared with the responses with gyro on for barge alone and barge with static owt 6 3 uncertainty analysis the accuracy of the experiments can be evaluated by quantifying the uncertainty in the measured values under two types namely type a and type b uncertainty as recommended by international organization for standardization guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurements iso 1995 iso gim 1995 the type a uncertainties also called the random uncertainties which characterizes the randomness of the experimental process are estimated using statistical methods applied to the results of repeated observations components in type a s q uncertainties are defined by the evaluated standard deviation among the repeated tests kim and hermansky 2014 type b uncertainty u x or systematic errors is constant for the duration of an experiment with a slow change in true value caused by the environmental influences characteristics of the experimental setup sensor and its calibration the data acquisition system used for the measurement processing and analysis type b uncertainty like type a may be assumed to be equal to the standard deviation generally it can be assumed that the type b uncertainty is normally distributed around some mean ittc 2011 for the present work the scope of the experiment is to estimate the roll rao of the barge which are the function of roll angle φ and wave slope k ζ a in which k is the wave number and ζ a is the wave amplitude in regular and irregular waves the uncertainty analysis has been done only for experiment with regular wave conditions to estimate type a uncertainty s q for barge and barge with static owt repeatability in the test was done for 3 times for selected wave height and wave period to calculate the standard deviation among the key parameters such as measured roll angle and wave amplitude the calculated standard deviation in roll angle and wave amplitude was 5 34 and 1 74 for barge and 7 98 and 2 4 for barge with static owt in regular wave conditions the source of type b uncertainties included here is sensors calibrations and data acquisition system errors the combined standard uncertainty u c y of observed experimental values as a function of one or more variables can be calculated using taylor series method tsm for propagating the uncertainties of the variables into the determined result coleman and steele 2009 as follows 13 φ ˆ f φ ζ a k and the combined standard uncertainty u c φ ˆ for roll rao by substituting the appropriate values for sensitive coefficients and the uncertainties in the tsm

uncertainties in the rrao have been plotted as error bars in the rrao graph in section 7 1 and 7 3 7 results and discussion 7 1 response of barge subjected to regular wave excitation a sample time histories comparison of roll motion response of barge for unidirectional beam sea regular wave height of 4 5 cm with gyrostabilizer off and on condition flywheel at 5320 rpm for the time periods of 0 9 s 0 95 s and 1 0 s is shown in fig 13 from the time series comparisons it can be observed that significant motion reduction occurs for a barge with gyro on condition the maximum reduction is observed near the resonant period 0 95 s of the model it can also be observed that there is a significant change in phase between the two responses i e barge responses with gyro off and on condition the phase shift of 90 was observed in response at the near resonant period of the model the stabilized time series length of 8 s for wave periods t 0 8 s and 10 s for t 1 05 s with ten cycles were used to obtain the average responses from the time series of wave and responses for beam sea condition the rrao was obtained for gyro off and on conditions for three rpm cases 4560 rpm 4940 rpm and 5320 rpm comparison of rrao of the barge for the range of tested wave heights shown in table 5 with gyro off and gyro on condition is shown in fig 14 from these figures it can be seen that the peak response is around 0 95 s for gyrostabilizer off condition which is close to the natural period 0 98 s of the model for the range of wave heights tested the peak of the rrao with gyro off condition occurred at 0 95 s near natural period and the value varied from 1 73 to 1 29 the variation of rrao with wave height is due to possible nonlinear interaction at the resonant region for periods other than the near natural period the rrao almost remains constant for different wave heights the uncertainties in the experimental measurements are shown in the form of error bar in fig 14 amongst all wave heights base rpm of 4560 12v of the flywheel during gyro on condition gives the significant reduction of roll response for period 0 95 s near natural period the motion response of the model was further tested for 4940 rpm and 5320 rpm of the flywheel and the results are shown in fig 14 for gyro on condition the rrao almost remains invariant for different wave heights also it can be observed that the increased rpm results in a higher reduction of motion the percentage of reduction in rrao for barge were estimated and the maximum and minimum reduction percentage of roll response was observed at 0 95 s and 0 8 s overall it can be seen that maximum reduction occurs at higher rpm and in most cases the maximum reduction occurs near natural period the maximum reduction observed from the experiment is almost 60 h 3 cm t 0 95 s 7 2 response of barge subjected to irregular wave excitation the sample response time series for gyro off and on condition for 4 5 cm significant wave height t p 0 9 s 1 0 s 1 1 s for 5320 rpm case is shown in fig 13 the effect of gyrostabilizer in roll reduction is significant in the region of maximum responses from the time series it is observed that there is a significant reduction in the irregular wave roll response of the barge model the response spectrums with gyrostabilizer on and off conditions for three different rpms are shown in fig 15 for different peak periods and for a constant significant wave height of 5 cm from these figures significant motion reduction is observed and the motion reduction is highest in the case where the peak frequency of the spectrum is close to the natural frequency of the barge the response spectral quantities calculated using eq 12 for various significant wave heights and peak periods see table 6 are shown in table 7 from the table it is inferred that the significant roll heights twice the roll amplitude are higher for all the h s cases at the t p value of 0 9 s and 1 0 s which is nearer to the natural period 0 98 s of the model and the motion damping is high for all the h s values with t p as 0 9 s and 1 0 s the percentage of reduction in irregular wave roll responses of barge were analyzed a noticeable motion reduction was observed with gyrostabilizer on condition and the highest reduction percentage for most of the test cases was observed for 4940 rpm the maximum reduction in the irregular wave roll response of barge observed from the experiment is almost 50 h s 4 5 cm t p 1 1 s 7 3 response of barge with static owt subjected to regular wave excitation a sample time series comparison of roll motion response of the barge with static owt for unidirectional beam sea regular wave height of 3 5 cm with gyrostabilizer off and on condition flywheel at 5320 rpm for the time periods of 1 1 s 1 2 s and for the near natural period of 1 15 s is shown in fig 16 from the time series it is observed that the roll response of barge fitted with static owt is higher when compared to the roll response of the barge only during gyro off condition the presence of the long hollow cylinder representing the turbine leads to the lower metacentric height gmt and thereby less restoring moment than barge alone condition is the primary reason for the increased response response comparisons were made between gyro off and on condition and it can be observed that a noticeable reduction in the magnitude of roll response occurs for gyro on condition the maximum reduction is observed near the damped resonant period 1 15 s of the model it can also be observed that there is a significant shift in phase between the two responses i e barge fitted with the static owt response with gyro off and on condition the phase shift of 90 was observed in the response between gyro on and off for the wave periods of 1 1 s 1 15 s the stabilized time series length of 7 s for wave period t 1 0 s and 9 2 s for t 1 3 s with seven cycles were used to obtain the average responses from the time series of wave and responses for beam sea condition the rrao was obtained for gyro off and on conditions with three rpm cases 4560 rpm 4940 rpm and 5320 rpm comparison of rrao of barge fitted with static owt with gyro off and gyro on condition is shown in fig 17 from these figures it can be seen that the peak response is around 1 15 s for gyrostabilizer off condition which is close to the damped natural period 1 152 s of the model for the range of wave heights tested the peak of the rrao with gyro off condition occurred at 1 15 s near natural period and the value varied from 2 95 to 2 36 the variation of roll rao with wave heights are due to the possible nonlinear interactions at the resonant region for periods other than near damped natural period the rrao almost remains constant for different wave heights amongst all wave heights significant reduction of roll motion was observed for period 1 1 s 1 15 s 1 2 s around damped natural period for the flywheel rpm of 4560 the response of the model was further tested for 4940 rpm and 5320 rpm of the flywheel and the results are shown in fig 17 along with uncertainty in the measurements in the form of error bar for gyro on condition the rrao almost remains invariant for different wave heights also it can be observed that the increased rpm results in a higher reduction of roll response the percentage of reduction in rrao for barge with static owt were evaluated and the maximum and minimum response percentage reduction was observed at 1 15 s and 1 0 s overall it can be seen that maximum reduction occurs at higher rpm and in most cases the maximum reduction occurs near the damped natural period of the model the maximum reduction in response observed from the experiment is almost 55 h 2 cm 3 cm t 1 15 s 7 4 response of barge with static owt subjected to irregular wave excitation the sample irregular wave roll response time series for gyro off and on condition for 5 cm significant wave height t p 1 1 s 1 15 s 1 2 s for 5700 rpm case is shown in fig 16 from these figures it is observed that there is a significant reduction in the energy of irregular wave response of the barge fitted static owt for gyro on condition the response spectrums with gyrostabilizer on and off conditions for three different rpms are shown in fig 18 for different peak periods and for a constant significant wave height of 5 cm from these figures significant motion reduction is observed and the motion reduction is highest in the case where the peak frequency of the spectrum is close to the natural frequency the response spectral quantities for various significant wave heights and peak periods see table 6 are shown in table 8 from the table it is inferred that the significant roll heights twice the roll amplitude are higher for all the h s cases at the t p value of 1 1 s and 1 15 s which is nearer to the natural period 1 1 s of the model and the motion damping is high for the all the h s values with t p as 1 05 s 1 1 s and 1 15 s near natural periods the percentage of reduction in irregular wave roll response for the different wave excitation cases were estimated based on the area under spectrum a noticeable motion reduction was observed in which higher rpm 5700 rpm has the highest reduction percentage for most of the test cases and for all rpm case damping was better around the natural period of the model and significantly less for t p value away from the natural period the maximum percentage of reduction in the irregular wave roll response observed from the experiment is almost 54 h s 3 cm t p 1 1 s for irregular waves the increase in rpm of the flywheel during gyro on condition did not result in an increment in motion reduction of the models this clearly indicates that gyrostabilizer with an optimum rpm and properly tuned gimbal precession variable gain instead of constant gain for control scheme will result in a higher response reduction in irregular waves 7 5 full scale requirements scaling of variables using froude s law is carried out to determine the equivalent full scale system the scale factor λ adopted here is 50 the scale factor for mass λ3 diameter is λ and frequency is λ 0 5 based on these the prototype flywheel mass is 216 2 tons diameter is 5 5 m spin rate is 806 rpm and precession frequency is same as roll prototype frequency ranging from 0 1346 hz to 0 1768 hz for barge 0 11 hz 0 14 hz for barge mounted wind turbine the flywheel weight adopted is 4 of displacement ofbarge alone in practice it is challengeable and difficult to design a system with such huge rotational mass and levels of torque required to nutate tilting the gimbal frame the gyroscopic flywheels so one can also use gyrostabilizer with two or more flywheel or placing combination of multiple gyrostabilizer in same line with same torque specifications rather than a single one the roll amplitude of the iti barge has to be limited to φ 5 for normal operation to extract power from the wind turbine jonkman 2007 the scaling parameter for roll angle is 1 i e same for the prototype and model the response of scaled model has roll amplitude of φ ζ 10 for highest wave heights tested using gyrostabilizer the roll amplitude has been reduced to more than 50 this suggests that the proposed percentage of stabilization is sufficient at prototype level so that the wind turbine can be operated even at higher wave heights hence based on the results of the present investigations it is possible to use the gyrostabilizer as a stabilizing tool for barge mounted wind turbines in prototype structures 8 conclusion a gyrostabilizer was successfully designed and fabricated and extensive experiments were conducted to test its performance in motion stabilization of a barge with and without static owt experiments were performed on a barge representing a floating substation and barge with static owt representing a floating wind turbine for regular and irregular waves based on the experimental studies following conclusions are drawn 8 1 barge barge with gyrostabilizer on condition showed a significant reduction in roll motions under regular waves for all wave periods and reduction is higher near the natural period of the model the maximum roll motion reduction achieved is 60 for h 3 cm t 0 95 s in the range of rpms tested higher rpm resulted in higher motion reduction due to higher stabilizing moment barge with gyrostabilizer on condition showed a significant reduction in roll motions under irregular waves for all peak periods and reduction is higher near the natural frequency of the model the maximum roll reduction achieved is 50 for h s 4 5 cm t p 1 1 s amongst three rpm tested 4940 rpm yielded the highest reduction percentage for most of the test cases 8 2 barge with static owt barge with static owt for gyrostabilizer on condition showed a significant reduction in roll motions under regular waves for all wave periods and reduction is higher near the damped natural period of the model the maximum roll response reduction achieved is 55 for h 3 cm t 1 15 s in the range of rpms tested higher rpm resulted in higher motion reduction due to higher stabilizing moment barge with gyrostabilizer on showed a significant reduction in roll motions under irregular waves for all peak periods and reduction is higher near the natural frequency of the model the maximum reduction achieved is 54 for h s 3 cm t p 1 1 s amongst three rpms tested 5700 rpm yielded the highest reduction percentage for most of the test cases from these model studies it can be concluded that gyrostabilizer can be effectively used in controlling the motions of the floater and therefore can be considered for offshore wind energy applications the percentage reduction in motion showed by the experiments can be achieved in the prototype by proper design of gyroscopic stabilizer this work is limited in exploring the performance of the gyrostabilizer in mitigating the responses and since displacement measurements at the tip and gyroscopic effects study are also needed in developing and recommending the potential operational envelop and these will be the focus of

energy because of its many advantages over other renewable energy resources offshore wind energy has been the focus of some regions worldwide and is being harvested due to its advantages jacket monopole and gravity based structures are used as a substructure to support the wind turbine superstructures these structures are limited to the shallow depth of 20 m 50 m due to material and installation cost the floating substructures like spar tension leg platform tlp semisubmersibles and barge are more suitable in deeper waters barge supported owt is the simplest and has a large box

dealing with storage and distribution of electrical energy is integral part of the barge which requires a separate deck it is also possible to have a separate barge as an isolated floating substation stobbe and ole 2019 along with the floater supporting owt though barges have a minimum complexity of design fabrication transit and fitting are prone to wave induced angular motions compared to other types of floating substructures these oscillatory motions of the barge are to be limited for effective operations of the owt which calls for using suitable motion control devices many of the motion stabilization in ships aims at controlling roll motions and can be achieved through passive and active types of stabilizers bilge keels anti roll tanks movement of solid weights are few examples under passive type active controls include active roll tanks active fin stabilizers rudder roll stabilization and gyrostabilizers by using gyrostabilizers in ships the roll damping are achieved through gyroscopic counteracting moment that is created by the precession of heavy flywheel that rotates at higher angular velocity bhattacharyya 1978 with regard to control of motions on offshore wind turbine supported by barge structures different techniques are being explored control techniques used in the wind turbine structures include blade pitch controller hybrid mass damper and active vane controllers and these are mounted on the nacelle and rotor blades however these mountings tend to affect the aerodynamic performance of the turbine to avoid this drawback stabilization devices on substructures such as active and passive tuned mass damper tmd liquid column damper lcd and ball vibration absorber bva etc can be used on the floater to mitigate the motions among the traditional ship roll stabilizers gyrostabilizer has potential advantage in stabilizing the motions in a short time interval besides excluding the complexity of fluid structure interaction as it is mounted inside the vessel by using gyrostabilizers ships roll reduction up to 60 has been achieved for a 41 000 ton displacement italian luxury liner gillmer and johnson 1982 82 for navy patrol vessel using halcyon

increased in the yacht industries for roll damping with veemgyro steinmann 2019 as well as seakeeper seakeeper 2019 achieving roll motion reduction to the extent of 95 hence this gyrostabilizer can be explored to control the barge angular motions and make it suitable for offshore floating substation and to support owt this paper presents on the details of the experimental studies carried out on a 1 50 scaled model of iti barge to mitigate the angular motions of barge type floating substations and barge fitted with a scaled model of offshore static owt structure with active gyrostabilizer subjected to the range of regular and irregular wave excitations 1 1 literature review as far as stabilization techniques concerned jonkman 2013 studied the influence of control on the angular motion

skerrett 1915 tea 1932 roitenberg 1960 presented the theory of gyrostabilizer and its engineering application on naval ships and monorails state of the art research on gyrostabilizer for ocean applications was discussed by townsend et al 2007 who introduced a gyroscopic method of active ride control on marine vehicles perez and steinmann 2009 presented the modeling of gyrostabilizer with

townsend and shenoi 2012 discussed a gyroscopic wave energy recovery system generating power and motion stabilization of the marine vessels they also investigated the nonlinear dynamics of a single gimbal gyroscopic energy harvester excited by a harmonic moment about two axes simultaneously townsend and shenoi 2013 besides examining the passive derivative based reaction wheel and unrestricted gimbal control strategies for a marine gyrostabilizer system townsend and shenoi 2014 from the literature review theories on experimental modeling of potential applications of the gyroscope on actual systems to control motions are limited the performance of active gyrostabilizer to control the motion of a barge and barge with floating offshore wind turbine fixed has not been experimentally studied widely and forms the motivation of this work and investigation 2 gyroscope and motion control gyrostabilizer gyro is a device that is also used to control the motions of the vessel where it is attached the most common parts of gyrostabilizer are the flywheel gimbal frame motor and stand fig 1 shows the schematic picture of single axis gyrostabilizer here the flywheel is just a spinning mass rotated by means of a motor around its axis and remains parallel to it and oppose any change in its orientation by external forces by installing a flywheel on gimbals that allow the mass to navigate freely in the three directions of space its spinning axis will remain oriented in the same direction even if the gimbal frame changes direction precession and nutation which are closely related are a few of the physical phenomena associated with a gyroscope when a constant external moment respectively a constant angular speed is applied to the mass its rotation axis undergoes a precession motion at a constant angular speed respectively with a constant output moment in a direction that is normal to the direction of the applied external moment in fig 1 z axis is the spinning axis and when an external moment is applied about y axis the gimbal frame with flywheel will precess about the x axis gyrostabilizer works based on the principle of the law of conservation of angular momentum and large moment can be generated when the flywheel is constrained in rotational motion once the gyro is attached to the vessel the stabilizing moment against the roll motion is generated by the following process the waves induce a rolling moment which causes the vessel to roll angular motion about y axis precession motion about the x axis is created due to roll motion of floater combining with the spinning flywheel combination of precession motion and spinning flywheel create the stabilizing moment this is shown schematically in fig 2 and forms the fundamentals of gyro dynamics based on the flywheel spin axis gyrostabilizers are classified as horizontal axis gyrostabilizer hag and vertical axis gyrostabilizer vag also based on control of precession motion they are classified as passive and active gyrostabilizers fig 2 a and b shows the schematic of vag and hag respectively the vag and hag differ in the axis spinning of the flywheel and the precession in vag flywheel spins about z axis and precess about the x axis see fig 2 a and in hag flywheel spins about x axis with precession about z axis see fig 2 b when the body is displaced a counteracting moment is generated resulting in motion reduction the hag has many disadvantages compared to the vag the horizontal spinning axis does not allow the use of natural precession precession of gimbal without any actuator mechanism for external torque due to slewing ring type bearings that are mostly used for tilting rotating large mass with spinning object in the horizontal plane the usage of such bearing does not allow natural precission due to the excessive resistance of the slewing ring type bearings and requires that the precession motion to be driven to overcome this resistance fig 2 c shows the schematic of active gyrostabilizer by using active adaptive precession control systems the gyros efficiency is increased for a wide range of conditions without needing to tune by an operator steinmann 2014 therefore active gyrostabilizer is opted for motion stabilization of barge and barge with static offshore floating wind turbine 2 1 uncoupled and coupled equation of motion for gyro and barge fig 3 shows the coordinates of the active gyro and barge coupled system let oxyz be the coordinate system of the gimbal and oxyz is the coordinate system of the barge in the equilibrium position the principal axes oxyz of the gimbal with flywheel coincide with the axes oxyz of the platform during operation of gyro the precession angle α of the gimbal relative to the ox axis is called the output angle and ψ is the spin angle 2 1 1 uncoupled eom of gyro the equation of motion of single axis active gyrostabilizer about the output angle is given by townsend and shenoi 2014 1 i g s α b g s α c g s α l φ c o s α

wave generated roll exciting moment in more refined model these coefficients are actually frequency dependent 2 1 3 coupled system barge with gyrostabilizer the equation of motion of a single axis gyro stabilized floating barge for the roll motion can be expressed as 3 i r φ b r φ c r φ m φ m g s where m g s n l α c o s α is the reactional moment n is the number of the flywheel n 1 for this experimental study and the equation of motion of active gyrostabilizer with precession controlled moment τ p about the precession axis of gimbal along with the flywheel is given by 4 i g s α b g s α c g s α l φ c o s α τ p eqs 3 and 4 are valid for roll angle up to 1 rad perez and steinmann 2009 3 scaled model particulars 3 1 scaling scheme to evaluate the behavior of the prototype structure and to reproduce its response of the offshore structure that will be exhibited at the operational offshore site a scaled model test should be conducted using appropriate scaling laws for wave structure interaction problem in ocean engineering the most important non dimensionless numbers that govern the scaling laws are froude fr reynolds re keulegan carpernter kc and strouhal st among this re scaling is used for fluid flow problems where viscous force is an important criterion kc model is used for drag dominated problem st relates to vortex shedding and the fr for the inertia dominated environment oscillatory motions of the iti barge are dominant due to the excitation created by the gravity waves on the inertia of the barge hence froude law is used to scale down the barge prototype for angular motion studies with gyrostabilizer in a wave flume the ratio of inertia force to the gravitational force is the froude number and is given by chakrabarti 2005 5 f r i n e r t i a f o r c e s g r a v i t y f o r c e s v 2 g d where v is the velocity of the system g is the gravity and d is the characteristic length of the system the prototype to scaled model relation with scale factor is given by 6 n p λ n m where n is the parameter to be scaled p is the prototype m is the model and λ is the scale factor the chosen scale of the model was constrained by the wave flume dimensions and water depth the testing wave flume supports 1 50 or less model scale of iti barge model and the larger scale will lead to an increase in overall gyrostabilizer system cost with design and fabrication difficulties hence a 1 50 scaled model of iti energy barge and barge with static owt as offshore floating wind turbine was chosen for the study 3 2 design and fabrication of scale model 3 2 1 floater the salient details of the complete model are given in tables 1 and 2 table 1 shows the geometric properties of the prototype and the scaled model hydrostatic properties of experimental models are

hollow cylinder a 1 50 scaled down model of vestas v90 3 mw wind turbine was represented as a hollow circular acrylic tube the inner diameter of the tube is 50 mm and thickness of 5 mm and a connector rod was used to hold the tube in position on the barge fig 4 shows schematic diagram with details of fabricated model of barge and barge model with static owt used for experimental investigations fig 5 a shows the actual fabricated barge model and fig 5 b shows the actual fabricated barge model with static owt in the wave flume 3 2 2 gyrostabilizer gyrostabilizer model was fabricated using stainless steel and aluminium the gyrostabilizer was designed based on the barge geometric specification limitation such as height length and breadth the flywheel was fabricated using stainless steel with the 11 cm outer diameter and 4 cm thickness the vacuum chamber model of flywheel arrangement in industrial use for energy harvesting is avoided due to the space restriction of occupancy and to reduce the model complication the flywheel was grooved to make hollow with an inner diameter of 7 2 cm from the bottom to 3 3 cm on the top and remaining 0 7 cm was kept to hold the motor that rotates the flywheel flywheel inner edge at the bottom was filleted to make the wiring process easy for the flywheel motor fig 6 shows the details and schematic design of flywheel and gimbal frame the dismantable gimbal channel frame for creating the precession motion along with flywheel to develop stabilizing moment in the gyrostabilizer was fabricated using high strength aluminium al7075 t6 with dimension 180 80 10 mm a motor hub of radius 45 mm and height 20 mm was fixed on the centre of the lower frame to hold the stator part of the brushless dc bldc motor the flywheel was attached to the rotor part of the bldc motor with m3 align screw having less friction between the motor shaft and flywheel both the sides of the gimbal frame had a hollow circular shaft extension 14 mm dia and 2 mm thick with 25 mm length on one side and 40 mm long on the other side servo actuator was attached to the shorter circular shaft extension and the other longer extension was used for housing the wiring for the motor the whole gimbal frame along with flywheel was attached to a vertical stand made of aluminium al7075 t6 through ntn shielded deep groove ball bearing 6803zzcm 5k the bearing arrangement on the stand transfers the gyroscopic moment from the gimbal and counteracts the exciting moment on the floater the whole arrangement of the gimbal with vertical stand is fitted in the plywood of dimension 400 400 150 mm with aluminium l angle and clearance is kept in such a way that gimbal can precess freely without any contact disturbance gyrostabilizer platform was fitted in the centre of the barge such that the gimbal axis is perpendicular to beam sea condition continuous rotational servo motor savox sc 1256tg was connected to the short extension shaft of gimbal frame to actuate the gimbal arrangement with a flywheel for an active precession motion of gyrostabilizer based on the angular disturbance of the platform the shaft rotates about precession axis with 90 clockwise and anticlockwise based on the controller signal the geometric and physical details of the gyrostabilizer are given in table 3 and the schematic diagram of gyrostabilizer along with the fabricated model is shown in fig 7 apart from bldc motor and servo actuator gyrostabilizer consists of electronic speed controller esc for controlling the rpm of the flywheel motor a transmitter receiver system and a microcontroller connected to the personal computer that can be accessed through mission planner graphical user interface gui open source software bldc motor and servo actuator were controlled by pulse width modulation pwm signal through a microcontroller fig 8 shows the operating scheme layout of gyrostabilizer fitted inside the barge for motion reduction operating scheme of gyrostabilizer is as follows 1 the microcontroller is powered through usb via pc and it is accessed through the mission planner gui 2 the power supply is given to the esc to power up the flywheel bldc motor and servo actuator by dc power supply 3 the flywheel is toggled to attain a targeted rpm angular velocity by manually adjusting the joystick of the transmitter which intern send the command to the microcontroller board which will transmit the pwm signal to the motor through the esc 4 once the targeted rpm is attained the model is subjected to waves in the wave flume and the corresponding angular motion of the platform is measured by the mems gyro sensor 5 based on the measured signal from the sensor the microcontroller board will send the pwm signal to the servo actuator to actuate the gimbal frame forth and back about the precession axis for precession motion 6 reaction moment called stabilizing moment is created due to the precession motion of the gimbal frame and the moment is transferred to the platform to counteract the exciting moment created by the waves the sequence of scheme 4 6 is repeated to achieve motion reduction 4 experiments on scaled models different

three different rpms of the flywheel the entire test cases of experimental studies carried out is shown as a flow chart in fig 9 4 1 wave flume and model setup various experiments on the barge and barge model with static owt were conducted in the wave flume at department of ocean engineering iit madras chennai india the flume is 2 m wide 30 m long and 1 5 m deep with 1m constant water depth the flume is equipped with piston type wavemaker with a hydraulic actuator in one end capable of producing regular and irregular waves of pre designated spectral parameters rubble mound wave shelter of 1 5 m long to reduce wave reflection and allow wave absorption at the other end the flume layout is shown in fig 10 the barge model was placed centrally at 8 4 m from the wave paddle a catenary mooring

microcontroller board was connected to the pc by universal serial bus usb cable the schematic diagram of the experimental setup in wave flume is shown in fig 10 for barge and barge with static owt 4 2 instrumentation calibration and control a resistant type wave probe which was connected to the wavemeter was used to measure the wave elevation wave probe was calibrated manually by immersing a known length inside a water column to measure the output in volts from a series of these values the calibration constant was obtained as 16 1 cm per volt two axis inclinometer psital fraba was used to measure the platform roll response due to unidirectional excited waves it was calibrated manually by giving a known amount of inclination and the output in volts was measured from a series of these values the calibration constant was found to be 40 per volt with an accuracy of 0 1 the angular velocity of the bldc motor which rotates gyrostabilizer flywheel was also calibrated a known input dc voltage was given and the resulting revolution per minute rpm was measured using tachometer and the flywheel speed calibration test results are shown in fig 11 from the figure the calibration constant is obtained as 380 rpm v state and state derivative feedback proportional derivative pd controller was used for actuating gimbal frame precession motion to establish gyroscopic moment to counteract the roll motion of the floating model the pd controller is given by perez and steinmann 2009 7 τ p p α q α where α is the precession angle α is the precession rate p 4 is the state feedback gain and q 0 2 is the state derivative feedback gain adopted for all the test cases with gyrostabilizer on condition these constants were obtained by trial and error method the servo motor restricted the maximum precision angle of gimbal to 57 3 i e 1 rad perez and steinmann 2009 5 free oscillation tests free oscillation test was conducted in the wave flume for roll degree of freedom of scaled down model of iti energy barge and iti energy barge fitted with scaled owt floating rigid barge with and without the turbine along with gyrostabilizer in off condition was given as initial angular displacement and then released the resulting decay time series was recorded and from the time series the damped natural frequency ω d 2 π f d period t d 2 π ω d and damping ratio ζ were estimated the damping ratio was obtained by the logarithmic decrement method averaging over successive cycles the non dimensional damping coefficient and circular frequency is given by chakrabarti 2005 8 ζ 1 2 π ln φ a i φ a i 1 φ a i 2 φ a i 3 ω n ω d 1 ζ 2 where φ a i φ a i 1 etc represent roll amplitude separated over a period of t d free oscillation time series for the above mentioned conditions are shown in fig 12 and the parameters obtained from the plots are given in table 4 6 forced oscillation tests experiments on a floating barge with and without static owt with gyrostabilizer on and off conditions were tested in the wave flume elaborate experiments were carried for different cases as shown in fig 9 regular and irregular waves were generated for 35 s for barge alone and 30 s for barge fitted with static owt the data measuring system consists of wave probe with a wave meter to measure the generated wave data inclinometer to measure the angular oscillatory motions of the model data recording system consists of hbm spider8 with 8 channels was connected to the personal computer pc equipped with catman data acquisition daq software the wave and dynamic response of the model were recorded for barge and barge fitted with owt with a sampling rate of 150 hz 6 1 regular wave environment for barge alone and barge fitted with static owt responses were measured under regular waves at zero degrees heading for a range of wave heights and wave periods the test matrix for the regular wave experiments is shown in table 5 the models have been subjected to the wave periods of which are above below and near the natural period of the model for each wave height waves were generated and resulting roll motions were recorded the roll motion is represented by non dimensional transfer function as response amplitude divided by wave steepness as recommended by the ittc and is termed as roll response amplitude operator rrao denoted by 9 r r a o φ ˆ φ a k ζ a where φ a is the roll amplitude and k ζ a is the wave steepness of the corresponding regular harmonic wave the steady state response time series were used to obtain the rao s motions of the barge alone and barge fitted with a static owt case were recorded for gyro on and off conditions the gyrostabilizer switched on condition study was tested with base flywheel angular velocity of 4560 rpm 12v for which noticeable roll motion damping was observed the gyroscopic moment which damps the angular motion of the barge is given by 10 τ g y r o l ω p l i g s ω s p i n where ω p is the precession rate of the gyro in order to increase the gyroscopic moment rate further either one has to increase the angular momentum of the flywheel or the precession rate of the gimbal increase in precession rate is restricted by the servo actuator limitation and the only option is to increase the angular momentum here the effect of the increase in angular momentum on roll motion damping was studied for three different velocities by varying the dc voltage viz 12v 4560 rpm 13v 4940 rpm and 14v 5320 rpm responses with gyro off were compared with the responses of gyrostabilizer on condition for these three rpm cases to investigate the potential of blockage effects few cases of experiments of the wave flume were repeated in a wave basin of 30 m 30 m 3 m the time series showed a reasonable match and it is concluded that the blockage effects are marginal 6 2 irregular wave environment iti energy barge was designed and developed by the department of naval architecture and marine engineering at the universities of glasgow and strathclyde for north sea conditions represented by jonswap spectrum vijfhuizen 2008 besides some of the indian coast the sea state can be modeled by jonswap spectrum hence jonswap spectrum has been selected to

the significant motion response height is given by bhattacharyya 1978 12 m 0 0 s φ f d f h φ 1 3 4 m 0 where s φ f is the power spectral density the responses of barge and barge fitted with static owt were recorded for the gyro off and on condition for barge with gyro on condition experiments were carried for three different rpms of the flywheel 4560 rpm 4940 rpm and 5320 rpm also for a barge with static owt with gyro on condition experiments were carried for three different rpms of the flywheel 4940 rpm 5320 rpm and 5700 rpm irregular wave response with gyro off were compared with the responses with gyro on for barge alone and barge with static owt 6 3 uncertainty analysis the accuracy of the experiments can be evaluated by quantifying the uncertainty in the measured values under two types namely type a and type b uncertainty as recommended by international organization for standardization guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurements iso 1995 iso gim 1995 the type a uncertainties also called the random uncertainties which characterizes the randomness of the experimental process are estimated using statistical methods applied to the results of repeated observations components in type a s q uncertainties are defined by the evaluated standard deviation among the repeated tests kim and hermansky 2014 type b uncertainty u x or systematic errors is constant for the duration of an experiment with a slow change in true value caused by the environmental influences characteristics of the experimental setup sensor and its calibration the data acquisition system used for the measurement processing and analysis type b uncertainty like type a may be assumed to be equal to the standard deviation generally it can be assumed that the type b uncertainty is normally distributed around some mean ittc 2011 for the present work the scope of the experiment is to estimate the roll rao of the barge which are the function of roll angle φ and wave slope k ζ a in which k is the wave number and ζ a is the wave amplitude in regular and irregular waves the uncertainty analysis has been done only for experiment with regular wave conditions to estimate type a uncertainty s q for barge and barge with static owt repeatability in the test was done for 3 times for selected wave height and wave period to calculate the standard deviation among the key parameters such as measured roll angle and wave amplitude the calculated standard deviation in roll angle and wave amplitude was 5 34 and 1 74 for barge and 7 98 and 2 4 for barge with static owt in regular wave conditions the source of type b uncertainties included here is sensors calibrations and data acquisition system errors the combined standard uncertainty u c y of observed experimental values as a function of one or more variables can be calculated using taylor series method tsm for propagating the uncertainties of the variables into the determined result coleman and steele 2009 as follows 13 φ ˆ f φ ζ a k and the combined standard uncertainty u c φ ˆ for roll rao by substituting the appropriate values for sensitive coefficients and the uncertainties in the tsm

the measurements using the term expanded uncertainty u the expanded uncertainty at a given percent level of confidence can be determined using a confidence factor such that ittc 2011 15 u k ˆ u c φ ˆ

iitc recommended a set of k ˆ values for the normally distributed uncertainties assuming the higher confidence interval of 95 woodward et al 2016 for which k ˆ 1 96 the estimated expanded uncertainties in the rrao have been plotted as error bars in the rrao graph in section 7 1 and 7 3 7 results and discussion 7 1 response of barge subjected to regular wave excitation a sample time histories comparison of roll motion response of barge for unidirectional beam sea regular wave height of 4 5 cm with gyrostabilizer off and on condition flywheel at 5320 rpm for the time periods of 0 9 s 0 95 s and 1 0 s is shown in fig 13 from the time series comparisons it can be observed that significant motion reduction occurs for a barge with gyro on condition the maximum reduction is observed near the resonant period 0 95 s of the model it can also be observed that there is a significant change in phase between the two responses i e barge responses with gyro off and on condition the phase shift of 90 was observed in response at the near resonant period of the model the stabilized time series length of 8 s for wave periods t 0 8 s and 10 s for t 1 05 s with ten cycles were used to obtain the average responses from the time series of wave and responses for beam sea condition the rrao was obtained for gyro off and on conditions for three rpm cases 4560 rpm 4940 rpm and 5320 rpm comparison of rrao of the barge for the range of tested wave heights shown in table 5 with gyro off and gyro on condition is shown in fig 14 from these figures it can be seen that the peak response is around 0 95 s for gyrostabilizer off condition which is close to the natural period 0 98 s of the model for the range of wave heights tested the peak of the rrao with gyro off condition occurred at 0 95 s near natural period and the value varied from 1 73 to 1 29 the variation of rrao with wave height is due to possible nonlinear interaction at the resonant region for periods other than the near natural period the rrao almost remains constant for different wave heights the uncertainties in the experimental measurements are shown in the form of error bar in fig 14 amongst all wave heights base rpm of 4560 12v of the flywheel during gyro on condition gives the significant reduction of roll response for period 0 95 s near natural period the motion response of the model was further tested for 4940 rpm and 5320 rpm of the flywheel and the results are shown in fig 14 for gyro on condition the rrao almost remains invariant for different wave heights also it can be observed that the increased rpm results in a higher reduction of motion the percentage of reduction in rrao for barge were estimated and the maximum and minimum reduction percentage of roll response was observed at 0 95 s and 0 8 s overall it can be seen that maximum reduction occurs at higher rpm and in most cases the maximum reduction occurs near natural period the maximum reduction observed from the experiment is almost 60 h 3 cm t 0 95 s 7 2 response of barge subjected to irregular wave excitation the sample response time series for gyro off and on condition for 4 5 cm significant wave height t p 0 9 s 1 0 s 1 1 s for 5320 rpm case is shown in fig 13 the effect of gyrostabilizer in roll reduction is significant in the region of maximum responses from the time series it is observed that there is a significant reduction in the irregular wave roll response of the barge model the response spectrums with gyrostabilizer on and off conditions for three different rpms are shown in fig 15 for different peak periods and for a constant significant wave height of 5 cm from these figures significant motion reduction is observed and the motion reduction is highest in the case where the peak frequency of the spectrum is close to the natural frequency of the barge the response spectral quantities calculated using eq 12 for various significant wave heights and peak periods see table 6 are shown in table 7 from the table it is inferred that the significant roll heights twice the roll amplitude are higher for all the h s cases at the t p value of 0 9 s and 1 0 s which is nearer to the natural period 0 98 s of the model and the motion damping is high for all the h s values with t p as 0 9 s and 1 0 s the percentage of reduction in irregular wave roll responses of barge were analyzed a noticeable motion reduction was observed with gyrostabilizer on condition and the highest reduction percentage for most of the test cases was observed for 4940 rpm the maximum reduction in the irregular wave roll response of barge observed from the experiment is almost 50 h s 4 5 cm t p 1 1 s 7 3 response of barge with static owt subjected to regular wave excitation a sample time series comparison of roll motion response of the barge with static owt for unidirectional beam sea regular wave height of 3 5 cm with gyrostabilizer off and on condition flywheel at 5320 rpm for the time periods of 1 1 s 1 2 s and for the near natural period of 1 15 s is shown in fig 16 from the time series it is observed that the roll response of barge fitted with static owt is higher when compared to the roll response of the barge only during gyro off condition the presence of the long hollow cylinder representing the turbine leads to the lower metacentric height gmt and thereby less restoring moment than barge alone condition is the primary reason for the increased response response comparisons were made between gyro off and on condition and it can be observed that a noticeable reduction in the magnitude of roll response occurs for gyro on condition the maximum reduction is observed near the damped resonant period 1 15 s of the model it can also be observed that there is a significant shift in phase between the two responses i e barge fitted with the static owt response with gyro off and on condition the phase shift of 90 was observed in the response between gyro on and off for the wave periods of 1 1 s 1 15 s the stabilized time series length of 7 s for wave period t 1 0 s and 9 2 s for t 1 3 s with seven cycles were used to obtain the average responses from the time series of wave and responses for beam sea condition the rrao was obtained for gyro off and on conditions with three rpm cases 4560 rpm 4940 rpm and 5320 rpm comparison of rrao of barge fitted with static owt with gyro off and gyro on condition is shown in fig 17 from these figures it can be seen that the peak response is around 1 15 s for gyrostabilizer off condition which is close to the damped natural period 1 152 s of the model for the range of wave heights tested the peak of the rrao with gyro off condition occurred at 1 15 s near natural period and the value varied from 2 95 to 2 36 the variation of roll rao with wave heights are due to the possible nonlinear interactions at the resonant region for periods other than near damped natural period the rrao almost remains constant for different wave heights amongst all wave heights significant reduction of roll motion was observed for period 1 1 s 1 15 s 1 2 s around damped natural period for the flywheel rpm of 4560 the response of the model was further tested for 4940 rpm and 5320 rpm of the flywheel and the results are shown in fig 17 along with uncertainty in the measurements in the form of error bar for gyro on condition the rrao almost remains invariant for different wave heights also it can be observed that the increased rpm results in a higher reduction of roll response the percentage of reduction in rrao for barge with static owt were evaluated and the maximum and minimum response percentage reduction was observed at 1 15 s and 1 0 s overall it can be seen that maximum reduction occurs at higher rpm and in most cases the maximum reduction occurs near the damped natural period of the model the maximum reduction in response observed from the experiment is almost 55 h 2 cm 3 cm t 1 15 s 7 4 response of barge with static owt subjected to irregular wave excitation the sample irregular wave roll response time series for gyro off and on condition for 5 cm significant wave height t p 1 1 s 1 15 s 1 2 s for 5700 rpm case is shown in fig 16 from these figures it is observed that there is a significant reduction in the energy of irregular wave response of the barge fitted static owt for gyro on condition the response spectrums with gyrostabilizer on and off conditions for three different rpms are shown in fig 18 for different peak periods and for a constant significant wave height of 5 cm from these figures significant motion reduction is observed and the motion reduction is highest in the case where the peak frequency of the spectrum is close to the natural frequency the response spectral quantities for various significant wave heights and peak periods see table 6 are shown in table 8 from the table it is inferred that the significant roll heights twice the roll amplitude are higher for all the h s cases at the t p value of 1 1 s and 1 15 s which is nearer to the natural period 1 1 s of the model and the motion damping is high for the all the h s values with t p as 1 05 s 1 1 s and 1 15 s near natural periods the percentage of reduction in irregular wave roll response for the different wave excitation cases were estimated based on the area under spectrum a noticeable motion reduction was observed in which higher rpm 5700 rpm has the highest reduction percentage for most of the test cases and for all rpm case damping was better around the natural period of the model and significantly less for t p value away from the natural period the maximum percentage of reduction in the irregular wave roll response observed from the experiment is almost 54 h s 3 cm t p 1 1 s for irregular waves the increase in rpm of the flywheel during gyro on condition did not result in an increment in motion reduction of the models this clearly indicates that gyrostabilizer with an optimum rpm and properly tuned gimbal precession variable gain instead of constant gain for control scheme will result in a higher response reduction in irregular waves 7 5 full scale requirements scaling of variables using froude s law is carried out to determine the equivalent full scale system the scale factor λ adopted here is 50 the scale factor for mass λ3 diameter is λ and frequency is λ 0 5 based on these the prototype flywheel mass is 216 2 tons diameter is 5 5 m spin rate is 806 rpm and precession frequency is same as roll prototype frequency ranging from 0 1346 hz to 0 1768 hz for barge 0 11 hz 0 14 hz for barge mounted wind turbine the flywheel weight adopted is 4 of displacement ofbarge alone in practice it is challengeable and difficult to design a system with such huge rotational mass and levels of torque required to nutate tilting the gimbal frame the gyroscopic flywheels so one can also use gyrostabilizer with two or more flywheel or placing combination of multiple gyrostabilizer in same line with same torque specifications rather than a single one the roll amplitude of the iti barge has to be limited to φ 5 for normal operation to extract power from the wind turbine jonkman 2007 the scaling parameter for roll angle is 1 i e same for the prototype and model the response of scaled model has roll amplitude of φ ζ 10 for highest wave heights tested using gyrostabilizer the roll amplitude has been reduced to more than 50 this suggests that the proposed percentage of stabilization is sufficient at prototype level so that the wind turbine can be operated even at higher wave heights hence based on the results of the present investigations it is possible to use the gyrostabilizer as a stabilizing tool for barge mounted wind turbines in prototype structures 8 conclusion a gyrostabilizer was successfully designed and fabricated and extensive experiments were conducted to test its performance in motion stabilization of a barge with and without static owt experiments were performed on a barge representing a floating substation and barge with static owt representing a floating wind turbine for regular and irregular waves based on the experimental studies following conclusions are drawn 8 1 barge barge with gyrostabilizer on condition showed a significant reduction in roll motions under regular waves for all wave periods and reduction is higher near the natural period of the model the maximum roll motion reduction achieved is 60 for h 3 cm t 0 95 s in the range of rpms tested higher rpm resulted in higher motion reduction due to higher stabilizing moment barge with gyrostabilizer on condition showed a significant reduction in roll motions under irregular waves for all peak periods and reduction is higher near the natural frequency of the model the maximum roll reduction achieved is 50 for h s 4 5 cm t p 1 1 s amongst three rpm tested 4940 rpm yielded the highest reduction percentage for most of the test cases 8 2 barge with static owt barge with static owt for gyrostabilizer on condition showed a significant reduction in roll motions under regular waves for all wave periods and reduction is higher near the damped natural period of the model the maximum roll response reduction achieved is 55 for h 3 cm t 1 15 s in the range of rpms tested higher rpm resulted in higher motion reduction due to higher stabilizing moment barge with gyrostabilizer on showed a significant reduction in roll motions under irregular waves for all peak periods and reduction is higher near the natural frequency of the model the maximum reduction achieved is 54 for h s 3 cm t p 1 1 s amongst three rpms tested 5700 rpm yielded the highest reduction percentage for most of the test cases from these model studies it can be concluded that gyrostabilizer can be effectively used in controlling the motions of the floater and therefore can be considered for offshore wind energy applications the percentage reduction in motion showed by the experiments can be achieved in the prototype by proper design of gyroscopic stabilizer this work is limited in exploring the performance of the gyrostabilizer in mitigating the responses and since displacement measurements at the tip and gyroscopic effects study are also needed in developing and recommending the potential operational envelop and these will be the focus of

21783,steel lazy wave risers slwrs are regarded as an alternative option of advanced steel catenary risers scrs and their nonlinear dynamic performance is a great challenge as subjected to vessel offsets and wave current loads especially the mechanical features would be more complicated due to the introduction of the buoyancy module system this paper presents a numerical model based on three dimensional 3d large deformation rod theory the whole space model is divided into four parts touchdown segment decline segment buoyancy segment and hang off segment to accurately simulate the favorable motion performance of the slwr the governing equations are established in terms of a global coordinate system which involves the effects of vessel motion wave current loads riser seabed interaction and internal flow the finite element method combined with an adams moulton scheme is applied to discretize the governing equation and update the time integration the numerical model is verified with the published results and numerical simulations are executed to determine the dynamic behavior of the slwr the comprehensive parametric analysis is then conducted to investigate the influences of motion amplitude motion period length of buoyancy segment wave current load internal flow seabed friction on the slwr s dynamic behavior keywords steel lazy wave riser slwr nonlinear dynamic performance finite element method top motions wave current loads 1 introduction steel lazy wave risers slwrs can be used as an effective deepwater oil and gas exploitation system production as their low cost and good reliability the resultant top loads and fatigue life are also significantly improved in comparison with to free hanging catenary configuration this type of riser has been employed as a viable solution in deepwater and ultra deepwater applications due to elimination of partial tension compared with traditional steel catenary risers scrs as shown in fig 1 a there is a sag bend and an arc bend indicated in fig 1 b at the middle section of the slwr by introducing additional buoyancy modules in addition the sag and arc parts can isolate the riser motions from vessel motions which avoid the amplification of dynamic response induced by vessel motions this means that the dynamic responses of a slwr can be independently analyzed due to the decoupling between the riser top and the touchdown point extensive researches have been performed using nonlinear numerical theory on the dynamic analysis of scrs for example walton and polachek 1960 as one of the earliest researchers applied the lumped mass model to investigate the dynamic responses of a two dimensional 2 d vertical tube but in their model the bending and torsional rigidity were ignored along the same lines buckham 2003 low and langley 2006 zhu and yoo 2014 2015 and fan et al 2018 conducted a series of parametric studies on the three dimensional 3 d scrs another common approach is finite difference method based on the principle of equilibrium for the microelements jason et al 2000 sophia 2007 chatjineorgiou 2008 the finite difference method can provide solutions in a reasonable time on standard computers but does not simulate accurately the boundary conditions which may cause some numerical instability on this regard finite element method fem is adopted to take with complex flexible pipe profile and boundary conditions cook 1974 bathe 1996 garrett 2005 kim et al 2010 kim et al 2013 ji et al 2016 and qiao and ou 2013 applied fem together with minimum energy principle to formulate dynamic equation of motion for mooring riser system however in their beam models the transformation process of the physical parameters from local to global system requires long computation time and large computer cpu recently a special fem absolute coordinate based elastic rod theory has also been widely used ran 2000 berzeri and shabana 2000 tahar and kim 2008 yang et al 2012 to simulate the dynamic performance of mooring or riser system the corresponding model is formulated directly in a global coordinate system which can reduce significantly the number of effective elements for complex structures thus this paper presents an alternative but more intimate slwr formulation using the absolute coordinate approach the application of the absolute coordinate approach for the solution of the rod equations is also found the previous study by the same authors 2018 the internal flow effect is identified and quantified by adding plug flow term to the effective tension equation meanwhile the structure seabed interaction is also simulated by using nonlinear quadratic spring combined with coulomb friction model all above studies of the dynamic features of slender structures were still based on the traditional scr tests which will not represent slwr events i e the static configuration of the slwr under the environment of currents and waves the effects of internal flow and the seabed interaction on the dynamic responses of the slwr in addition the dynamic responses of the slwr are more complicated than those of the traditional scr because the introduction of the suspended part would lead to large angle deformations of the arch bend and the sage bend only a few studies of slwr have been reported to date base on the natural catenary theory and linear beam theory wang et al 2011 proposed an analytical model to investigate the static behavior of a slwr on plastic seabed along the same lines jang 2013 2014 investigated the nonlinearity of a slwr configuration using infinite beam model later ruan et al 2014 developed a new analytical model of a slwr subjected to current loads and elastic seabed santillan and virgin 2011 presented a parametric study on lazy s and steep s shaped risers by regarding the suspended part as a concentrated lift force applied at the arch bend top they also conducted relevant model tests by using small scale models to validate the numerical solutions wang et al 2014 2015 obtained the numerical solutions of the installation abandonment transfer and recovery process of the slwr using finite difference method based on nonlinear large deflection beam theory wang and duan 2015 further extended the theory to investigate the effect of the internal flow velocity on the mechanical performance of the slwr they found that the internal flow has significant influence on the axial tension while does not contribute much to the configuration bending moment and equivalent stress of the slwr however these mentioned studies are limited to the static analysis of a slwr within 2 d plane and they are not appropriate when the dynamic performance of a slwr is considered based on the natural catenary li and nquyen 2010 investigated preliminarily the dynamic behavior of a slwr in his model each segment was regarded as a simple catenary and thus the effect of the bending stiffness was ignored kim and kim 2015 used commercial analysis techniques to compare the dynamic performance of traditional scrs and slwrs the numerical simulations suggested that the application of the slwr can significantly reduce the stress level and fatigue damage near touch down zone but they did not provide the detail model of dynamic characteristics for the slwr the nonlinear dynamic analysis of the slwr has not been exhaustive studied and it still needs to be better and comprehensively analyzed in addition it could be computationally more efficient and physically realistic to model dynamic problems of the slwr with respect to some uncertainties i e the internal flow and seabed effect the primary objective of this study is to investigate the nonlinear dynamic behavior of a slwr subjected to the vessel offsets and wave current loads the nonlinear model of wave current slwr interaction is based on the 3 d large deformation rod theory proposed by ran 2000 an efficient fem absolute coordinate approach is presented to discrete the motion equation and extensible condition so that nodal variables can be expressed as global position displacements and their derivatives this eliminates all transformation functions which is typically required in commercial fem softwares in order to simulate the entire pipeline accurately the formulas are also generalized to include the effect of internal flow and riser seabed interaction which are of particular importance for the 3 d dynamic performance of the suspended section a classic newton raphson approach is used to solve the static configuration of the slwr whereas an adams moulton iteration scheme is applied to update the dynamic response at each time step calculations are made concerning the mechanical behaviors of the touchdown segment laid on the seabed the decline segment the buoyance segment and the hang off segment suspended in the water this paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly describes the developed numerical model in section 3 the present model is verified against the published numerical results in section 4 the effects of the harmonic motion parameters the incident wave parameters and the geometric parameters on the dynamic tension of the slwr are presented and discussed finally the conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 problem definition when considering the effect of the top motion wave current loads the riser seabed interaction and the internal flow the dynamic nonlinear analysis of the slwr are complicated within 3 d space due to the particularity of introducing buoyancy segment to facilitate this calculation the following assumptions and simplifications are made for the slwr in this work 1 the internal flow is assumed to be an elongated cylinder with infinite flexibility and the cross section has the same velocity at each point 2 the seabed is modeled as an elastic foundation in the vertical direction and the horizontal lateral friction is linearly related to the effective weight of the riser 3 both axial deformation and twisting behavior of the umbilical are neglected here because they have scarce effect in practical applications a typical slwr in the open sea with water depth d is considered as shown in fig 2 a sketch of the entire model is established in the global coordinate system oxyz with the origin o at the end point of the touchdown segment as mentioned above the numerical model consists of four segments the touchdown segment o b the decline segment b d the buoyancy segment d a l and the hang off segment l e h the touchdown segment o b is horizontally laid on the seabed from origin point o to the touchdown point b tdp and is mainly subjected to the riser seabed interaction including both the vertical support and horizontal friction the decline segment b d is suspended in water from the tdp to the decline point dp and its length varies according to the dynamic behavior of the touchdown segment the buoyancy segment d a l is subjected to greater upward buoyancy force than the downward gravity force and thus an arch bend is generated the arch bend point a is the peak of the arch bend and its elevation z arc is defined from the seabed to the arch location the hang off segment l e h presents a u shape with a sag bend the sag bend point e is the lowest point of the sag bend and its elevation z sag is defined from the seabed to the sag location the hand off point h is connected to the floating platform and the top inclined angle θ t is defined as the intersection angle from the horizontal line to the tangent line at the top point h 2 2 suspended segment modelling the suspended segment of a slwr comprises three parts decline segment b d buoyancy segment d a l and hang off segment l e h due to the lifting forces induced by the buoyancy modules the inclined angles in the zone of arch bend and sag bend changes rapidly when the slwr is subjected dynamic loads this would lead to nonlinear stress strain relationship of the riser therefore the catenary theory or small deformation beam theory can only give the total static profile and curvature with small deflection while the nonlinear dynamic displacement with large deformation cannot be accurately analyzed in this paper the elastic rod theory with large deformation is applied to solve the dynamic behavior of the slwr in a 3 d global coordinate system as shown in fig 2 the centerline of the riser in the deformed state can be described by a position curve r s t in which s and t are the arc length function and time respectively both the decline segment s s s s s s d s s is the arc length of the touchdown segment and s d is the arc length of the decline segment and hang off segments s s s d s b s s s s d s b s h s b is the arc length of the buoyancy segment and s h is the arc length of the hang off segment are single layer steel riser but the buoyancy segment s s s d s s s s d s b consists of buoyancy modules the dynamic behavior of the buoyancy segment is very different from that of the decline and hang off segments to conveniently conduct the numerical model the buoyancy modules are approximated as a single riser with equivalent flexural stiffness and equivalent submerged weight according to conservation of linear momentum the motion equation of the rod can be expressed as ran 2000 1 e i j r λ r q j ρ j r 2 1 2 r r 1 λ e a j where the subscript j denotes the different location along the riser ρ j is the density of the riser λ is the lagrange multiplier primes and dots represent spatial derivative and time derivative respectively ei j and ea

is the buoyancy force p o and p i are external and internal fluid pressure respectively a o and a i are outer and inner cross sectional areas respectively f j d is the hydrodynamic force which includes tangential and normal components i e f τ d and f n d and can be obtained from morison s formula 4 f j d c a j r ρ w π d j 2 4 v n c a j v n 1 2 c d j ρ w d j v n r n v n r n c a j r f j d where c aj c aj ρ w πd j 2 4 ρ w is water density c aj is inertial coefficient d j is outsider diameter of the rod v n and v n are fluid velocity and acceleration normal to the rod centerline fluid velocity includes the wave and current components i e v v w v c in which v w and v c denote the wave and current velocity respectively substituting eqs 3 and 4 into eq 1 we can obtain final motion equation 5 ρ j r c a j r n e i j r λ j r w j f j d where λ j t p o a o p i a i j e i j κ 2 w j w j b j where t is the local tension κ r is the local curvature of the line the term in the parentheses in the definition of λ j is called effective tension w j is the effective gravity force and is further obtained by 6 w j ρ j a j ρ i a i j ρ w a o j where a j a oj and a ij are the cross sectional area the outer cross sectional area and the internal cross sectional area respectively ρ i is the density of the internal fluid 2 3 touchdown segment modelling the touchdown segment is mainly subjected to the riser seabed interaction the seabed resistance affects obviously the dynamic performance of the segment near the tdp according to the previous research cheng et al 2018a wang et al 2015 the top tension of the riser lying on the seabed would be magnified and the seabed friction can prevent the touchdown segment from moving away along the surface of the seabed therefore it is necessary to quantify the riser seabed interaction which including the seabed support and friction effect in order to derive a consistent tangent stiffness a nonlinear quadratic spring support is used to simulate the winkler type foundation this means that when the riser has a distance of one half diameter from the nominal seabed the touchdown segment is classified into the decline segment as the riser moves closer to the seabed the support force increases quadratically when the riser is one half diameter off the nominal seabed elevation the support provides no local vertical force for the touchdown segment the horizontal frictional force per unit length can determined by a simple coulomb friction model thus the riser seabed interaction f 3 on the touchdown segment can be expressed as 7 f 3 c r r 3 z s 2 x μ r m v r k z r r 3 z s 0 μ r m c v r k z r r 3 z s 0 where r is the outer radius r 3 is the z component of the position vector z s is the z coordinate of the seabed elevation c w 0 r 2 is the spring constant the subscript m 1 2 denotes the horizontal components μ is the friction coefficient c v is the tolerance for horizontal velocity r k is vertical reaction force per unit length supported by the seabed spring 2 4 internal flow modelling the transported internal fluid is modeled as a plug flow with a constant velocity u p and the force induced by the plug including inertia force the coriolis force and the centrifugal force can be obtained as 8 q s t ρ i a i 2 r t 2 2 u p 2 r s t u p 2 2 r s 2 incorporating the riser seabed interaction and the internal flow force into the rod model the governing equation can be derived 9 ρ j ρ i a i r c a j r n 2 ρ i a i u p r e i j r λ j r w j f j d f 3 the above formulation illustrates that the steady internal flow contributes a new term to the effective tension expression and the magnitude of the tension is independent of the internal flow direction furthermore the stretch condition is modified as 10 1 2 r r 1 λ j p o a o p i a i j ρ i a i u p 2 e a j 2 5 3 d nonlinear finite element method since the governing equation and the stretch condition are strong nonlinear its analytical solution is difficultly obtained in this regard a finite element method fem is used to discretize the entire slender structure into a set of collocation nodes the physical variables are interpolated based on the nodal values and the shape function with the elements cheng et al 2018b i e 11 r s t l 1 4 a l s u l t 12 λ s t k 3 p k s λ k t where a l and p k are respectively cubic and quadratic hermite interpolation

respectively by applying galerkin s method along the element length and assembling the corresponding matrixes in eqs 9 and 10 the nonlinear motion equation can be expressed as 13 m l m m l m a u m c l

by the body motions or wave loads is multiplied by the following modulation function cheng et al 2016 25 r m τ 3 6 τ 2 15 τ 10 t t 1 t t where τ t t t is the ramp period 3 model validation 3 1 static analysis of slwr to validate the present model the developed nonlinear fem was firstly used to investigate the configuration and static behavior of a slwr described by ruan et al 2014 in the numerical simulation the water depth is d 1500 m the current velocity is v 0 2 m s the top inclined angle is θt 87o the key geometric parameters of the slwr are given in table 1 using a simple catenary analytical solution as an iterative algorithm for finite element analysis only 4 iterations with 130 elements i e 40 elements on the touchdown decline segment 50 elements on the buoyancy segment and 40 elements on the hang off segment are used to get the final equilibrium configuration static tension and bending moment as shown in figs 3 5 together with the published analytical solution from ruan et al 2014 it can be seen from the results given by the proposed method and ruan et al 2014 agree well with each other which validates and confirms the capability of the present formulation and numerical method in resolving the static performance of the slwr from these figures it can be observed that the tension and bending moment oscillate between its maximum and minimum values along the riser length due to the installation of middle buoyancy modules which is different from the results of the scr this further indicates that the dynamic behavior of the slwr should be done with rigorous analysis 3 2 dynamic analysis of scr to further validate the present model the developed numerical model is then compared with the dynamic behavior of a realistic hanging riser configuration pinned at both ends in an infinite water depth the parameters of the riser are shown in table 2 the horizontal and vertical distances between the bottom and top end nodes are 100m and 50m respectively in addition the top node is located at 5 m below the water level which can ensure that all elements are below sea level for each of the considered load cases the number of elements on the whole riser is selected with 20 after the convergent test when the top end of the jumper is subjected to harmonic motions the dynamic behavior of the scr is examined fig 6 gives the time history of the top tension for two moving directions of the riser i e x moving direction in plane motion and y moving direction out of plane motion the comparison with the published numerical solution from low and langley 2006 is also presented it can be seen from these figures that there is an excellent agreement for both the amplitude and the phase between the present fem solutions and the lump mass solutions of low and langley 2006 this indicates that the numerical model can correctly capture the main features of the 3 d dynamic response for the flexible riser to sum up the presented numerical model can not only give rapidly the static configuration of a slwr but can also be extended to capture correctly the main dynamic performance of a riser with arbitrary configuration i e slwr which is further discussed in section 4 4 numerical results so far many papers have considered the static performance of the slwr however the static analysis sometimes leads the incorrect frequency distribution of tension and may further bring about non conservative results in certain condition the slwr may be subjected to the top node motion or wave current loads in addition the middle buoyance modules can induce more complex dynamic responses therefore in this section numerical simulations are conducted to investigate the time history of the effective tension of the different slwr segments and the effects of the geometric parameters motion wave amplitude motion period current direction internal flow and seabed friction on the dynamic behavior of the slwr are also investigated the principal details of the slwr are listed in table 3 which is used in the subsequent simulation unless it is specified 4 1 dynamic responses by the top end node with harmonic motion in this section a relatively comprehensive investigation of dynamic responses of the slwr by the top end node in various forced motion is provided the displacement of the top end node is given by ζi aisinωt in all the following solutions the water depth is d 1600 m the touchdown decline segment the buoyancy segment and the hang off segment are divided into 25 14 and 40 elements along the length of the riser the mesh distribution on the riser is shown in fig 7 in which the thicker point denotes the buoyancy segment mesh dependency investigation has been conducted to indicate that further increasing mesh number makers slight difference on the numerical results all the numerical solutions for the present study used time step δt t 50 according to the temporal convergence tests the top end node of the slwr in x direction motionζ1 a1sinωt is firstly considered fig 8 gives the time histories of the tension for three different motion amplitudes at period t 17 s here td ta tl and th denote the tensions occur at different locations i e d decline point a arch point l lift point and h hang off point which indicated in fig 8 as can be intuitively expected the tensions at different locations increase with increasing motion amplitude moreover it reveals more obvious non linearity of the tensions for larger motion amplitude among the four local locations the tension at the hang off point i e th is the maximum value compared with the tension at other locations but the tension at the arch point is the smallest value due to the upward buoyance force of the buoyancy module this result is consistent with the work of the static analysis indicated in fig 4 keeping the vertical motion amplitude perioda1 10 m and motion period t 17 s constant the effect of the buoyancy segment length on the tensions at different locations then is shown in fig 9 the tension at the decline point increases apparently with increasing the buoyancy segment length but the opposite is true for the arch point the lift point and the hang off point this is because that the buoyancy segment is the determining factor for the lazy wave configuration for example the decline segment tends to be steeper and the length of the touchdown segment becomes shorter with increasing the buoyancy segment length which leads to larger the submerged weight of the decline segment and thus the tension at the decline point i e td become larger conversely for the hang off segment the slope of riser decreases with increasing the buoyancy segment length which results into smaller tensions at the hang off segment i e tl and th this increase of the buoyancy segment length magnifies the lifting force on the zone of the arch bend and thus decreasing the tension at the arch point ta furthermore it can be seen from fig 10 a d that the difference between the maximum and minimum tensions is reduced with increasing the buoyancy segment length which means that the shorter buoyancy segment leads to more obvious dynamic performance of the slwr next the dynamic behavior by the top end node undergoing forced y direction motion is studied fig 10 presents the time histories of the tensions for three different motion amplitudes of a2 10 m 12 m and 14 m at period t 17 s it is observed that the nonlinear behavior of the tensions at the lift and hang off points are not obvious but some higher harmonic tensions are generated at the decline point which indicates that when the top end node moves along the out of plane direction i e y direction the dynamic nonlinearity of the slwr increases gradually from the hand off segment to the decline segment in addition with increasing motion amplitude the nonlinearity becomes stronger due to the faster variation of the riser shape compared to the dynamic behavior of the riser with x direction motion as shown in fig 10 the tensions along the length of the riser are smaller and appear to oscillate at double frequency of the riser motion which is consistent with the results of the simple catenary riser reported by low and langley 2006 it is of interest that there are no phase shifts among the tensions at the decline point arch point lift point and hang off point which means that the variations of tensions at all locations with time are identical thus when the tensions of the riser reach their maximum values the 3 d space configuration of the slwr and the corresponding projection on coordinate planes are shown in fig 11 the results reveal that the node displacements of the hang off segment are sensitive to the riser motion and are different with motion amplitude however the effect of the motion amplitude of the top node on the displacement of the buoyancy segment is slight and can be ignored moreover the displacements of the decline and touchdown segments are very small due to both the lift force induced by the buoyancy modules and the friction force induced by the seabed this indicates that the buoyancy modules not only reduce the hang off tension of the riser but also provide favorable motion performance of the decline and touchdown segments it can be also seen from fig 11 b and d that the maximum tension of the riser does not occur at the maximum displacement 10 m of top node along y direction due to the complex flexible features of the riser then we consider the top node of the slwr undergoing z direction motion fig 12 shows the tensions at the decline point the arch point the lift point and the hang off point at t 17 s for three different motion amplitudes comparing with the horizontal motions i e x direction and y direction motions the vertical motion of the top node leads to larger dynamic tension of the riser due to the length variation of the suspended segment in water and the nonlinearity of the dynamic performance is almost same with the increase in the excitation amplitude which is because the wave field is symmetry for the vertical motion of the top node of the slwr the tension appears to oscillate at the same period of the body motion and varies rapidly with the increase in oscillation amplitude further solutions are then carried out for a variety of motion periods with motion amplitude a1 2 3 10 m along the x direction y direction and z direction respectively fig 13 a d presents the variation of the tensions td ta tl and th with wave period it can be seen from the figure that for all direction motions the tensions of the riser are rapidly reduced until they reach their minimum values around t 19 s and remain about the same with increase in the excitation period this is because for a fixed motion amplitude the faster top node more effectively interaction with adjacent fluid field to more obvious dynamic performance of the slwr when the excitation period is larger than 19 s the top end node of slwr moves slowly and the tension of the riser is approximated to be the pre tension values which means that the corresponding mechanic features can be dealt by using the static analysis in addition the vertical motion of the top node can induce larger tensionsin the range of the whole tested periods compared to the horizontal motion 4 2 dynamic responses by the wave current excitation all results of section 4 1 were obtained for the forced motion of the top end node then what will happen if the slwr is subjected to the wave current loads to answer this question a series of numerical simulations have been conducted with different wave current parameters fig 14 gives the time history of the tension at the hang off point for three values of wave amplitude a 3 m 4 5 m and 6 m at wave period t 15 s wave incidence angle θ 00 and current velocity v 0 m s here the dynamic responses of the buoyancy segment the declined segment and the touchdown segment are slight which is because the incident wave velocity decays exponentially along the water depth it can be seen that with increasing of the incident wave amplitude the tension of the top end node increases and its nonlinearity becomes more significant due to the faster motion of the hang off segment in addition the time of the maximum and minimum tension is almost same with different wave amplitudes this indicates that the wave amplitude has a weak influence on the occurring time of the peak or trough value but change the amplitude of the tension keeping the wave parameters constant as with case indicated in figs 14 and 15 illustrates the effect of current incidence directions i e along the positive x direction along the positive y direction and along the negative x direction on the tension of the top end node at current velocity v 0 5 m s it is found that the tension of the riser for the opposing current i e along the negative x direction is apparently smaller than that for the following current i e along the positive x direction this is because that when the current are against the incident waves the relative velocity between the fluid and the riser is reduced to result into the mitigation of the hydrodynamic loads on the slwr according the morison equation and vice versa for the following current on the other hand all current directions almost induce the same tension difference about 2549 n which means that the current direction has a slight effect on variational amplitude of the dynamic behavior of the slwr with time in addition the occurring time of the peak or trough value are identical for different current directions then when the tension indicated in fig 16 arrives at the maximum value the 3 d space configuration of the swlr and the projection on each coordinate plane are shown in fig 16 it can be seen that the collinear waves and currents i e the opposing current and the following current lead to the in plane motion of the slwr while the non collinear waves and currents make a rather obvious portion of the slwr moving away from its in plane place in addition due to the additional middle modules the suspending segment in water can be motivated to have a more complicated deflection compared with the simple free hanging riser subjected the same wave current loads it is interesting from fig 16 c that the suspending height of the middle modules for the opposing current is larger than that for the following current which causes to a larger length of the decline segment for the opposing current therefore the general idea can be obtained that the top tension for the opposing current would be larger than that for the following current due to the increased weight of the declined segment this is in contradiction with the results of fig 15 in particular this can be explained by the structural features of the slwr the weight of the decline segment is absorbed by the middle modules and thus the tension of the top tension for the slwr is mainly dependent on the performance of the hang off segment the lengths of the hang off segment are unchanged for three current directions and more importantly the dynamic responses of the slwr are related to the existence of the wave current thus the following current can lead to a larger riser tension of the top node the internal flow is another key controlling factor of the dynamic behavior of the slwr it depends on the inflow density inflow velocity and internal pressure fig 17 a presents the time histories of the top tension of the swlr with and without internal flow for incident wave amplitude a 5 m wave period t 10 s current velocity v 0 m s the distributions of the corresponding maximum tension and bending moment along the riser also are given in fig 17 b and c respectively as seen from fig 17 a there is an obvious increase for the pre tension of the slwr when considering the inflow density while the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the dynamic tension is almost slightly affected by the internal flow fig 17 b reveals that the tension amplitude of the decline point with internal flow is larger than that without internal flow while the tension amplitude of the arch point is unchanged in addition the length of the touchdown segment is increased by the internal flow with considering the effect of the internal flow the numerical solutions indicate a clear right shift of the whole curve for the distribution of the maximum bending moment along the whole riser the maximum bending moments of the decline point and lift point with internal flow is larger than those without internal flow but it follows a completely opposite trend for the buoyancy segment this is because the bending moment is proportional to both the force arm and the tension for the decline and the hang off segments the tension is found to increases faster than the decreasing speed of the force arm as considering the internal flow and thus the corresponding bending moment may increase however for the buoyancy segment the tension is almost identical but the force arm decreases distinctly due to the increase of the submerged weight of the riser which leads to the reduction of the bending moment to study the effect of the inflow velocity and the top end internal pressure on the dynamic behavior of the slwr fig 18 gives the tension of the top end node for three different combination of internal flow parameters while other parameters are fixed by the given values it can be seen from this figure that the variations of three curves with time are similar i e there are not phase shifts among the tensions with different internal pressure and inflow velocity the difference is that with increasing the internal pressure or internal velocity the tension begins to increase at a smaller pre tension but they appear to vary with the same period finally in order to investigate the effect of the seabed friction on the dynamic behavior of the slwr in wave current excitation the incident angles of the wave and the current are imposed as along x direction and y direction fig 19 presents the tension comparison of the decline point the arch point the lift point and the hang off point with and without considering seabed friction for wave amplitude a 10 m wave period t 10 s inflow velocity u 10 m s top end internal pressure p top 20 mpa inflow density ρ 840 kg m from the clam water surface to the half of the water depth the current velocity is constant v 0 2 m s and then decreases linearly to be zero along the water depth it can be obtained that the maximum tension of the decline segment with considering the friction effect is slightly larger than that without considering friction effect while the tensions of the buoyancy segment and the hang off segment are nearly not affected by the seabed friction overall the tensions of the suspended segment in this case are not very sensitive to the seabed friction in other words the seabed friction does not contribute much to the dynamic response of the suspended segment however the dynamic analysis without considering friction may lead to the incorrect tension distribution along the decline segment and the results non conservative these issues can significantly influence the slwr design and specially concern with the fatigue problem of the decline segment when the tension reaches to maximum values the corresponding 3 d configuration of the slwr and 2 d projection curves on coordinate planes are given in fig 20 from fig 20 a it can be seen that the friction effect suppresses the touchdown decline and the buoyancy segments moving away the in plane while influences slightly the motion of the hang off segment this further is confirmed in fig 20 b and d in addition the length of the touchdown segment with considering friction effect is significantly smaller than that without considering friction effect this causes that the submerged weight of the decline segment with considering friction effect is larger than that without considering effect and thus the tension of the decline segment is increased by the friction effect which is consisted with the results indicated in fig 19 a however the curve shapes in each plane are not affected by the friction effect which leads to identical the tensions of the buoyancy segment and the hang off segment 5 conclusions this study presents a time domain numerical scheme to study the dynamic performance of the slwr subjected to the vessel offsets and wave current loads by using a nonlinear 3d finite element method the numerical model is based on a large deformation rod theory in terms of a global coordinate system which prevents all transformations involving trigonometric functions to accurately considering the additional lift force induced by the middle modules the numerical model is divided into four segments the touchdown segment the decline segment the buoyance segment and the hang off segment the effect of internal flow is incorporated into all segments of the slwr by adding an effective tension term to the governing equation the interaction of the seabed and the touchdown segment is accounted by using a nonlinear quadratic spring support and a simple coulomb friction model the resulting integral equations are solved within an adams moulton method extensive simulations have been undertaken and the following conclusions are obtained when the slwr is undergoing the x direction oscillations of the top end node the nonlinearity of the dynamic tension becomes more important as the motion amplitude increases the tension at the decline point increases rapidly as the buoyance segment increases and vice versa for the buoyance segment and the hang off segment additionally the varying amplitude of the tension is reduced with increasing the length of buoyancy segment the results indicate that the slwr can have a favorable dynamic behavior compared with the simple scr for the top node undergoing oscillation along the y direction the nonlinearity of the tension decreases gradually along touchdown part toward the top end node for the top end undergoing vertical oscillations the tension amplitude is larger in comparison with that of the horizontal motion and its nonlinearity is independent of the node location due to the symmetry of the radiation wave field as the motion period increases the dynamic responses of the slwr are reduced for all motions and then can be equivalent to the static configuration when the slwr is only subjected to wave current loads the results become very different due to the variation of the relative velocity between the structure and the fluid the dynamic features of the hang off segment are more obvious than that of the decline and buoyancy segments and its nonlinearity increases with the increase in the wave amplitude the results show that the tension is enhanced by a following current and reduced by an opposing current the non collinear waves and currents would induce the slwr moving away from its in plane location the internal flow parameters including density velocity and the top pressure have obvious influence on the dynamic behavior of the slwr for example the tension magnitude at the decline segment with internal flow is smaller than that without internal flow but it is opposite to that at the hang off segment the inflow velocity and the top pressure reduce the pre tension of the top end node but have little effect on the time of occurrence of the maximum tension the tension at the decline segment when considering seabed friction of the touchdown segment is larger than that without considering seabed friction and significantly affects the design and fatigue issue of the slwr this occurs because for a fixed wave current load a shorter length of touchdown segment when considering seabed friction increases the submerged weight of the decline segment credit authorship contribution statement yong cheng conceptualization

21783,steel lazy wave risers slwrs are regarded as an alternative option of advanced steel catenary risers scrs and their nonlinear dynamic performance is a great challenge as subjected to vessel offsets and wave current loads especially the mechanical features would be more complicated due to the introduction of the buoyancy module system this paper presents a numerical model based on three dimensional 3d large deformation rod theory the whole space model is divided into four parts touchdown segment decline segment buoyancy segment and hang off segment to accurately simulate the favorable motion performance of the slwr the governing equations are established in terms of a global coordinate system which involves the effects of vessel motion wave current loads riser seabed interaction and internal flow the finite element method combined with an adams moulton scheme is applied to discretize the governing equation and update the time integration the numerical model is verified with the published results and numerical simulations are executed to determine the dynamic behavior of the slwr the comprehensive parametric analysis is then conducted to investigate the influences of motion amplitude motion period length of buoyancy segment wave current load internal flow seabed friction on the slwr s dynamic behavior keywords steel lazy wave riser slwr nonlinear dynamic performance finite element method top motions wave current loads 1 introduction steel lazy wave risers slwrs can be used as an effective deepwater oil and gas exploitation system production as their low cost and good reliability the resultant top loads and fatigue life are also significantly improved in comparison with to free hanging catenary configuration this type of riser has been employed as a viable solution in deepwater and ultra deepwater applications due to elimination of partial tension compared with traditional steel catenary risers scrs as shown in fig 1 a there is a sag bend and an arc bend indicated in fig 1 b at the middle section of the slwr by introducing additional buoyancy modules in addition the sag and arc parts can isolate the riser motions from vessel motions which avoid the amplification of dynamic response induced by vessel motions this means that the dynamic responses of a slwr can be independently analyzed due to the decoupling between the riser top and the touchdown point extensive researches have been performed using nonlinear numerical theory on the dynamic analysis of scrs for example walton and polachek 1960 as one of the earliest researchers applied the lumped mass model to investigate the dynamic responses of a two dimensional 2 d vertical tube but in their model the bending and torsional rigidity were ignored along the same lines buckham 2003 low and langley 2006 zhu and yoo 2014 2015 and fan et al 2018 conducted a series of parametric studies on the three dimensional 3 d scrs another common approach is finite difference method based on the principle of equilibrium for the microelements jason et al 2000 sophia 2007 chatjineorgiou 2008 the finite difference method can provide solutions in a reasonable time on standard computers but does not simulate accurately the boundary conditions which may cause some numerical instability on this regard finite element method fem is adopted to take with complex flexible pipe profile and boundary conditions cook 1974 bathe 1996 garrett 2005 kim et al 2010 kim et al 2013 ji et al 2016 and qiao and ou 2013 applied fem together with minimum energy principle to formulate dynamic equation of motion for mooring riser system however in their beam models the transformation process of the physical parameters from local to global system requires long computation time and large computer cpu recently a special fem absolute coordinate based elastic rod theory has also been widely used ran 2000 berzeri and shabana 2000 tahar and kim 2008 yang et al 2012 to simulate the dynamic performance of mooring or riser system the corresponding model is formulated directly in a global coordinate system which can reduce significantly the number of effective elements for complex structures thus this paper presents an alternative but more intimate slwr formulation using the absolute coordinate approach the application of the absolute coordinate approach for the solution of the rod equations is also found the previous study by the same authors 2018 the internal flow effect is identified and quantified by adding plug flow term to the effective tension equation meanwhile the structure seabed interaction is also simulated by using nonlinear quadratic spring combined with coulomb friction model all above studies of the dynamic features of slender structures were still based on the traditional scr tests which will not represent slwr events i e the static configuration of the slwr under the environment of currents and waves the effects of internal flow and the seabed interaction on the dynamic responses of the slwr in addition the dynamic responses of the slwr are more complicated than those of the traditional scr because the introduction of the suspended part would lead to large angle deformations of the arch bend and the sage bend only a few studies of slwr have been reported to date base on the natural catenary theory and linear beam theory wang et al 2011 proposed an analytical model to investigate the static behavior of a slwr on plastic seabed along the same lines jang 2013 2014 investigated the nonlinearity of a slwr configuration using infinite beam model later ruan et al 2014 developed a new analytical model of a slwr subjected to current loads and elastic seabed santillan and virgin 2011 presented a parametric study on lazy s and steep s shaped risers by regarding the suspended part as a concentrated lift force applied at the arch bend top they also conducted relevant model tests by using small scale models to validate the numerical solutions wang et al 2014 2015 obtained the numerical solutions of the installation abandonment transfer and recovery process of the slwr using finite difference method based on nonlinear large deflection beam theory wang and duan 2015 further extended the theory to investigate the effect of the internal flow velocity on the mechanical performance of the slwr they found that the internal flow has significant influence on the axial tension while does not contribute much to the configuration bending moment and equivalent stress of the slwr however these mentioned studies are limited to the static analysis of a slwr within 2 d plane and they are not appropriate when the dynamic performance of a slwr is considered based on the natural catenary li and nquyen 2010 investigated preliminarily the dynamic behavior of a slwr in his model each segment was regarded as a simple catenary and thus the effect of the bending stiffness was ignored kim and kim 2015 used commercial analysis techniques to compare the dynamic performance of traditional scrs and slwrs the numerical simulations suggested that the application of the slwr can significantly reduce the stress level and fatigue damage near touch down zone but they did not provide the detail model of dynamic characteristics for the slwr the nonlinear dynamic analysis of the slwr has not been exhaustive studied and it still needs to be better and comprehensively analyzed in addition it could be computationally more efficient and physically realistic to model dynamic problems of the slwr with respect to some uncertainties i e the internal flow and seabed effect the primary objective of this study is to investigate the nonlinear dynamic behavior of a slwr subjected to the vessel offsets and wave current loads the nonlinear model of wave current slwr interaction is based on the 3 d large deformation rod theory proposed by ran 2000 an efficient fem absolute coordinate approach is presented to discrete the motion equation and extensible condition so that nodal variables can be expressed as global position displacements and their derivatives this eliminates all transformation functions which is typically required in commercial fem softwares in order to simulate the entire pipeline accurately the formulas are also generalized to include the effect of internal flow and riser seabed interaction which are of particular importance for the 3 d dynamic performance of the suspended section a classic newton raphson approach is used to solve the static configuration of the slwr whereas an adams moulton iteration scheme is applied to update the dynamic response at each time step calculations are made concerning the mechanical behaviors of the touchdown segment laid on the seabed the decline segment the buoyance segment and the hang off segment suspended in the water this paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly describes the developed numerical model in section 3 the present model is verified against the published numerical results in section 4 the effects of the harmonic motion parameters the incident wave parameters and the geometric parameters on the dynamic tension of the slwr are presented and discussed finally the conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 problem definition when considering the effect of the top motion wave current loads the riser seabed interaction and the internal flow the dynamic nonlinear analysis of the slwr are complicated within 3 d space due to the particularity of introducing buoyancy segment to facilitate this calculation the following assumptions and simplifications are made for the slwr in this work 1 the internal flow is assumed to be an elongated cylinder with infinite flexibility and the cross section has the same velocity at each point 2 the seabed is modeled as an elastic foundation in the vertical direction and the horizontal lateral friction is linearly related to the effective weight of the riser 3 both axial deformation and twisting behavior of the umbilical are neglected here because they have scarce effect in practical applications a typical slwr in the open sea with water depth d is considered as shown in fig 2 a sketch of the entire model is established in the global coordinate system oxyz with the origin o at the end point of the touchdown segment as mentioned above the numerical model consists of four segments the touchdown segment o b the decline segment b d the buoyancy segment d a l and the hang off segment l e h the touchdown segment o b is horizontally laid on the seabed from origin point o to the touchdown point b tdp and is mainly subjected to the riser seabed interaction including both the vertical support and horizontal friction the decline segment b d is suspended in water from the tdp to the decline point dp and its length varies according to the dynamic behavior of the touchdown segment the buoyancy segment d a l is subjected to greater upward buoyancy force than the downward gravity force and thus an arch bend is generated the arch bend point a is the peak of the arch bend and its elevation z arc is defined from the seabed to the arch location the hang off segment l e h presents a u shape with a sag bend the sag bend point e is the lowest point of the sag bend and its elevation z sag is defined from the seabed to the sag location the hand off point h is connected to the floating platform and the top inclined angle θ t is defined as the intersection angle from the horizontal line to the tangent line at the top point h 2 2 suspended segment modelling the suspended segment of a slwr comprises three parts decline segment b d buoyancy segment d a l and hang off segment l e h due to the lifting forces induced by the buoyancy modules the inclined angles in the zone of arch bend and sag bend changes rapidly when the slwr is subjected dynamic loads this would lead to nonlinear stress strain relationship of the riser therefore the catenary theory or small deformation beam theory can only give the total static profile and curvature with small deflection while the nonlinear dynamic displacement with large deformation cannot be accurately analyzed in this paper the elastic rod theory with large deformation is applied to solve the dynamic behavior of the slwr in a 3 d global coordinate system as shown in fig 2 the centerline of the riser in the deformed state can be described by a position curve r s t in which s and t are the arc length function and time respectively both the decline segment s s s s s s d s s is the arc length of the touchdown segment and s d is the arc length of the decline segment and hang off segments s s s d s b s s s s d s b s h s b is the arc length of the buoyancy segment and s h is the arc length of the hang off segment are single layer steel riser but the buoyancy segment s s s d s s s s d s b consists of buoyancy modules the dynamic behavior of the buoyancy segment is very different from that of the decline and hang off segments to conveniently conduct the numerical model the buoyancy modules are approximated as a single riser with equivalent flexural stiffness and equivalent submerged weight according to conservation of linear momentum the motion equation of the rod can be expressed as ran 2000 1 e i j r λ r q j ρ j r 2 1 2 r r 1 λ e a j where the subscript

subjected to the riser seabed interaction the seabed resistance affects obviously the dynamic performance of the segment near the tdp according to the previous research cheng et al 2018a wang et al 2015 the top tension of the riser lying on the seabed would be magnified and the seabed friction can prevent the touchdown segment from moving away along the surface of the seabed therefore it is necessary to quantify the riser seabed interaction which including the seabed support and friction effect in order to derive a consistent tangent stiffness a nonlinear quadratic spring support is used to simulate the winkler type foundation this means that when the riser has a distance of one half diameter from the nominal seabed the touchdown segment is classified into the decline segment as the riser moves closer to the seabed the support force increases quadratically when the riser is one half diameter off the nominal seabed elevation the support provides no local vertical force for the touchdown segment the horizontal frictional force per unit length can determined by a simple coulomb friction model thus the riser seabed interaction f 3 on the touchdown segment can be expressed as 7 f 3 c r r 3 z s 2 x μ r m v r k z r r 3 z s 0 μ r m c v r k z r r 3 z s 0 where r is the outer radius r 3 is the z component of the position vector z s is the z coordinate of the seabed elevation c w 0 r 2 is the spring constant the subscript m 1 2 denotes the horizontal components μ is the friction coefficient c v is the tolerance for horizontal velocity r k is vertical reaction force per unit length supported by the seabed spring 2 4 internal flow modelling the transported internal fluid is modeled as a plug flow with a constant velocity u p and the force induced by the plug including inertia force the coriolis force and the centrifugal force can be obtained as 8 q s t ρ i a i 2 r t 2 2 u p 2 r s t u p 2 2 r s 2 incorporating the riser seabed interaction and the internal flow force

gauss elimination method at each time step without any iteration in order to avoid an abrupt beginning and allow a gradual development for the dynamic behavior of the riser the exciting force induced by the body motions or wave loads is multiplied by the following modulation function cheng et al 2016 25 r m τ 3 6 τ 2 15 τ 10 t t 1 t t where τ t t t is the ramp period 3 model validation 3 1 static analysis of slwr to validate the present model the developed nonlinear fem was firstly used to investigate the configuration and static behavior of a slwr described by ruan et al 2014 in the numerical simulation the water depth is d 1500 m the current velocity is v 0 2 m s the top inclined angle is θt 87o the key geometric parameters of the slwr are given in table 1 using a simple catenary analytical solution as an iterative algorithm for finite element analysis only 4 iterations with 130 elements i e 40 elements on the touchdown decline segment 50 elements on the buoyancy segment and 40 elements on the hang off segment are used to get the final equilibrium configuration static tension and bending moment as shown in figs 3 5 together with the published analytical solution from ruan et al 2014 it can be seen from the results given by the proposed method and ruan et al 2014 agree well with each other which validates and confirms the capability of the present formulation and numerical method in resolving the static performance of the slwr from these figures it can be observed that the tension and bending moment oscillate between its maximum and minimum values along the riser length due to the installation of middle buoyancy modules which is different from the results of the scr this further indicates that the dynamic behavior of the slwr should be done with rigorous analysis 3 2 dynamic analysis of scr to further validate the present model the developed numerical model is then compared with the dynamic behavior of a realistic hanging riser configuration pinned at both ends in an infinite water depth the parameters of the riser are shown in table 2 the horizontal and vertical distances between the bottom and top end nodes are 100m and 50m respectively in addition the top node is located at 5 m below the water level which can ensure that all elements are below sea level for each of the considered load cases the number of elements on the whole riser is selected with 20 after the convergent test when the top end of the jumper is subjected to harmonic motions the dynamic behavior of the scr is examined fig 6 gives the time history of the top tension for two moving directions of the riser i e x moving direction in plane motion and y moving direction out of plane motion the comparison with the published numerical solution from low and langley 2006 is also presented it can be seen from these figures that there is an excellent agreement for both the amplitude and the phase between the present fem solutions and the lump mass solutions of low and langley 2006 this indicates that the numerical model can correctly capture the main features of the 3 d dynamic response for the flexible riser to sum up the presented numerical model can not only give rapidly the static configuration of a slwr but can also be extended to capture correctly the main dynamic performance of a riser with arbitrary configuration i e slwr which is further discussed in section 4 4 numerical results so far many papers have considered the static performance of the slwr however the static analysis sometimes leads the incorrect frequency distribution of tension and may further bring about non conservative results in certain condition the slwr may be subjected to the top node motion or wave current loads in addition the middle buoyance modules can induce more complex dynamic responses therefore in this section numerical simulations are conducted to investigate the time history of the effective tension of the different slwr segments and the effects of the geometric parameters motion wave amplitude motion period current direction internal flow and seabed friction on the dynamic behavior of the slwr are also investigated the principal details of the slwr are listed in table 3 which is used in the subsequent simulation unless it is specified 4 1 dynamic responses by the top end node with harmonic motion in this section a relatively comprehensive investigation of dynamic responses of the slwr by the top end node in various forced motion is provided the displacement of the top end node is given by ζi aisinωt in all the following solutions the water depth is d 1600 m the touchdown decline segment the buoyancy segment and the hang off segment are divided into 25 14 and 40 elements along the length of the riser the mesh distribution on the riser is shown in fig 7 in which the thicker point denotes the buoyancy segment mesh dependency investigation has been conducted to indicate that further increasing mesh number makers slight difference on the numerical results all the numerical solutions for the present study used time step δt t 50 according to the temporal convergence tests the top end node of the slwr in x direction motionζ1 a1sinωt is firstly considered fig 8 gives the time histories of the tension for three different motion amplitudes at period t 17 s here td ta tl and th denote the tensions occur at different locations i e d decline point a arch point l lift point and h hang off point which indicated in fig 8 as can be intuitively expected the tensions at different locations increase with increasing motion amplitude moreover it reveals more obvious non linearity of the tensions for larger motion amplitude among the four local locations the tension at the hang off point i e th is the maximum value compared with the tension at other locations but the tension at the arch point is the smallest value due to the upward buoyance force of the buoyancy module this result is consistent with the work of the static analysis indicated in fig 4 keeping the vertical motion amplitude perioda1 10 m and motion period t 17 s constant the effect of the buoyancy segment length on the tensions at different locations then is shown in fig 9 the tension at the decline point increases apparently with increasing the buoyancy segment length but the opposite is true for the arch point the lift point and the hang off point this is because that the buoyancy segment is the determining factor for the lazy wave configuration for example the decline segment tends to be steeper and the length of the touchdown segment becomes shorter with increasing the buoyancy segment length which leads to larger the submerged weight of the decline segment and thus the tension at the decline point i e td become larger conversely for the hang off segment the slope of riser decreases with increasing the buoyancy segment length which results into smaller tensions at the hang off segment i e tl and th this increase of the buoyancy segment length magnifies the lifting force on the zone of the arch bend and thus decreasing the tension at the arch point ta furthermore it can be seen from fig 10 a d that the difference between the maximum and minimum tensions is reduced with increasing the buoyancy segment length which means that the shorter buoyancy segment leads to more obvious dynamic performance of the slwr next the dynamic behavior by the top end node undergoing forced y direction motion is studied fig 10 presents the time histories of the tensions for three different motion amplitudes of a2 10 m 12 m and 14 m at period t 17 s it is observed that the nonlinear behavior of the tensions at the lift and hang off points are not obvious but some higher harmonic tensions are generated at the decline point which indicates that when the top end node moves along the out of plane direction i e y direction the dynamic nonlinearity of the slwr increases gradually from the hand off segment to the decline segment in addition with increasing motion amplitude the nonlinearity becomes stronger due to the faster variation of the riser shape compared to the dynamic behavior of the riser with x direction motion as shown in fig 10 the tensions along the length of the riser are smaller and appear to oscillate at double frequency of the riser motion which is consistent with the results of the simple catenary riser reported by low and langley 2006 it is of interest that there are no phase shifts among the tensions at the decline point arch point lift point and hang off point which means that the variations of tensions at all locations with time are identical thus when the tensions of the riser reach their maximum values the 3 d space configuration of the slwr and the corresponding projection on coordinate planes are shown in fig 11 the results reveal that the node displacements of the hang off segment are sensitive to the riser motion and are different with motion amplitude however the effect of the motion amplitude of the top node on the displacement of the buoyancy segment is slight and can be ignored moreover the displacements of the decline and touchdown segments are very small due to both the lift force induced by the buoyancy modules and the friction force induced by the seabed this indicates that the buoyancy modules not only reduce the hang off tension of the riser but also provide favorable motion performance of the decline and touchdown segments it can be also seen from fig 11 b and d that the maximum tension of the riser does not occur at the maximum displacement 10 m of top node along y direction due to the complex flexible features of the riser then we consider the top node of the slwr undergoing z direction motion fig 12 shows the tensions at the decline point the arch point the lift point and the hang off point at t 17 s for three different motion amplitudes comparing with the horizontal motions i e x direction and y direction motions the vertical motion of the top node leads to larger dynamic tension of the riser due to the length variation of the suspended segment in water and the nonlinearity of the dynamic performance is almost same with the increase in the excitation amplitude which is because the wave field is symmetry for the vertical motion of the top node of the slwr the tension appears to oscillate at the same period of the body motion and varies rapidly with the increase in oscillation amplitude further solutions are then carried out for a variety of motion periods with motion amplitude a1 2 3 10 m along the x direction y direction and z direction respectively fig 13 a d presents the variation of the tensions td ta tl and th with wave period it can be seen from the figure that for all direction motions the tensions of the riser are rapidly reduced until they reach their minimum values around t 19 s and remain about the same with increase in the excitation period this is because for a fixed motion amplitude the faster top node more effectively interaction with adjacent fluid field to more obvious dynamic performance of the slwr when the excitation period is larger than 19 s the top end node of slwr moves slowly and the tension of the riser is approximated to be the pre tension values which means that the corresponding mechanic features can be dealt by using the static analysis in addition the vertical motion of the top node can induce larger tensionsin the range of the whole tested periods compared to the horizontal motion 4 2 dynamic responses by the wave current excitation all results of section 4 1 were obtained for the forced motion of the top end node then what will happen if the slwr is subjected to the wave current loads to answer this question a series of numerical simulations have been conducted with different wave current parameters fig 14 gives the time history of the tension at the hang off point for three values of wave amplitude a 3 m 4 5 m and 6 m at wave period t 15 s wave incidence angle θ 00 and current velocity v 0 m s here the dynamic responses of the buoyancy segment the declined segment and the touchdown segment are slight which is because the incident wave velocity decays exponentially along the water depth it can be seen that with increasing of the incident wave amplitude the tension of the top end node increases and its nonlinearity becomes more significant due to the faster motion of the hang off segment in addition the time of the maximum and minimum tension is almost same with different wave amplitudes this indicates that the wave amplitude has a weak influence on the occurring time of the peak or trough value but change the amplitude of the tension keeping the wave parameters constant as with case indicated in figs 14 and 15 illustrates the effect of current incidence directions i e along the positive x direction along the positive y direction and along the negative x direction on the tension of the top end node at current velocity v 0 5 m s it is found that the tension of the riser for the opposing current i e along the negative x direction is apparently smaller than that for the following current i e along the positive x direction this is because that when the current are against the incident waves the relative velocity between the fluid and the riser is reduced to result into the mitigation of the hydrodynamic loads on the slwr according the morison equation and vice versa for the following current on the other hand all current directions almost induce the same tension difference about 2549 n which means that the current direction has a slight effect on variational amplitude of the dynamic behavior of the slwr with time in addition the occurring time of the peak or trough value are identical for different current directions then when the tension indicated in fig 16 arrives at the maximum value the 3 d space configuration of the swlr and the projection on each coordinate plane are shown in fig 16 it can be seen that the collinear waves and currents i e the opposing current and the following current lead to the in plane motion of the slwr while the non collinear waves and currents make a rather obvious portion of the slwr moving away from its in plane place in addition due to the additional middle modules the suspending segment in water can be motivated to have a more complicated deflection compared with the simple free hanging riser subjected the same wave current loads it is interesting from fig 16 c that the suspending height of the middle modules for the opposing current is larger than that for the following current which causes to a larger length of the decline segment for the opposing current therefore the general idea can be obtained that the top tension for the opposing current would be larger than that for the following current due to the increased weight of the declined segment this is in contradiction with the results of fig 15 in particular this can be explained by the structural features of the slwr the weight of the decline segment is absorbed by the middle modules and thus the tension of the top tension for the slwr is mainly dependent on the performance of the hang off segment the lengths of the hang off segment are unchanged for three current directions and more importantly the dynamic responses of the slwr are related to the existence of the wave current thus the following current can lead to a larger riser tension of the top node the internal flow is another key controlling factor of the dynamic behavior of the slwr it depends on the inflow density inflow velocity and internal pressure fig 17 a presents the time histories of the top tension of the swlr with and without internal flow for incident wave amplitude a 5 m wave period t 10 s current velocity v 0 m s the distributions of the corresponding maximum tension and bending moment along the riser also are given in fig 17 b and c respectively as seen from fig 17 a there is an obvious increase for the pre tension of the slwr when considering the inflow density while the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the dynamic tension is almost slightly affected by the internal flow fig 17 b reveals that the tension amplitude of the decline point with internal flow is larger than that without internal flow while the tension amplitude of the arch point is unchanged in addition the length of the touchdown segment is increased by the internal flow with considering the effect of the internal flow the numerical solutions indicate a clear right shift of the whole curve for the distribution of the maximum bending moment along the whole riser the maximum bending moments of the decline point and lift point with internal flow is larger than those without internal flow but it follows a completely opposite trend for the buoyancy segment this is because the bending moment is proportional to both the force arm and the tension for the decline and the hang off segments the tension is found to increases faster than the decreasing speed of the force arm as considering the internal flow and thus the corresponding bending moment may increase however for the buoyancy segment the tension is almost identical but the force arm decreases distinctly due to the increase of the submerged weight of the riser which leads to the reduction of the bending moment to study the effect of the inflow velocity and the top end internal pressure on the dynamic behavior of the slwr fig 18 gives the tension of the top end node for three different combination of internal flow parameters while other parameters are fixed by the given values it can be seen from this figure that the variations of three curves with time are similar i e there are not phase shifts among the tensions with different internal pressure and inflow velocity the difference is that with increasing the internal pressure or internal velocity the tension begins to increase at a smaller pre tension but they appear to vary with the same period finally in order to investigate the effect of the seabed friction on the dynamic behavior of the slwr in wave current excitation the incident angles of the wave and the current are imposed as along x direction and y direction fig 19 presents the tension comparison of the decline point the arch point the lift point and the hang off point with and without considering seabed friction for wave amplitude a 10 m wave period t 10 s inflow velocity u 10 m s top end internal pressure p top 20 mpa inflow density ρ 840 kg m from the clam water surface to the half of the water depth the current velocity is constant v 0 2 m s and then decreases linearly to be zero along the water depth it can be obtained that the maximum tension of the decline segment with considering the friction effect is slightly larger than that without considering friction effect while the tensions of the buoyancy segment and the hang off segment are nearly not affected by the seabed friction overall the tensions of the suspended segment in this case are not very sensitive to the seabed friction in other words the seabed friction does not contribute much to the dynamic response of the suspended segment however the dynamic analysis without considering friction may lead to the incorrect tension distribution along the decline segment and the results non conservative these issues can significantly influence the slwr design and specially concern with the fatigue problem of the decline segment when the tension reaches to maximum values the corresponding 3 d configuration of the slwr and 2 d projection curves on coordinate planes are given in fig 20 from fig 20 a it can be seen that the friction effect suppresses the touchdown decline and the buoyancy segments moving away the in plane while influences slightly the motion of the hang off segment this further is confirmed in fig 20 b and d in addition the length of the touchdown segment with considering friction effect is significantly smaller than that without considering friction effect this causes that the submerged weight of the decline segment with considering friction effect is larger than that without considering effect and thus the tension of the decline segment is increased by the friction effect which is consisted with the results indicated in fig 19 a however the curve shapes in each plane are not affected by the friction effect which leads to identical the tensions of the buoyancy segment and the hang off segment 5 conclusions this study presents a time domain numerical scheme to study the dynamic performance of the slwr subjected to the vessel offsets and wave current loads by using a nonlinear 3d finite element method the numerical model is based on a large deformation rod theory in terms of a global coordinate system which prevents all transformations involving trigonometric functions to accurately considering the additional lift force induced by the middle modules the numerical model is divided into four segments the touchdown segment the decline segment the buoyance segment and the hang off segment the effect of internal flow is incorporated into all segments of the slwr by adding an effective tension term to the governing equation the interaction of the seabed and the touchdown segment is accounted by using a nonlinear quadratic spring support and a simple coulomb friction model the resulting integral equations are solved within an adams moulton method extensive simulations have been undertaken and the following conclusions are obtained when the slwr is undergoing the x direction oscillations of the top end node the nonlinearity of the dynamic tension becomes more important as the motion amplitude increases the tension at the decline point increases rapidly as the buoyance segment increases and vice versa for the buoyance segment and the hang off segment additionally the varying amplitude of the tension is reduced with increasing the length of buoyancy segment the results indicate that the slwr can have a favorable dynamic behavior compared with the simple scr for the top node undergoing oscillation along the y direction the nonlinearity of the tension decreases gradually along touchdown part toward the top end node for the top end undergoing vertical oscillations the tension amplitude is larger in comparison with that of the horizontal motion and its nonlinearity is independent of the node location due to the symmetry of the radiation wave field as the motion period increases the dynamic responses of the slwr are reduced for all motions and then can be equivalent to the static configuration when the slwr is only subjected to wave current loads the results become very different due to the variation of the relative velocity between the structure and the fluid the dynamic features of the hang off segment are more obvious than that of the decline and buoyancy segments and its nonlinearity increases with the increase in the wave amplitude the results show that the tension is enhanced by a following current and reduced by an opposing current the non collinear waves and currents would induce the slwr moving away from its in plane location the internal flow parameters including density velocity and the top pressure have obvious influence on the dynamic behavior of the slwr for example the tension magnitude at the decline segment with internal flow is smaller than that without internal flow but it is opposite to that at the hang off segment the inflow velocity and the top pressure reduce the pre tension of the top end node but have little effect on the time of occurrence of the maximum tension the tension at the decline segment when considering seabed friction of the touchdown segment is larger than that without considering seabed friction and significantly affects the design and fatigue issue of the slwr this occurs because for a fixed wave current load a shorter length of touchdown segment when considering seabed friction increases the submerged weight of the decline segment credit authorship contribution statement yong cheng conceptualization

21784,this paper proposes a semi empirical model to estimate a ship s speed loss at head sea in the model the formulas to estimate a ship s added resistance due to waves have been further developed to better consider the ship hull forms in addition to other main particulars based on the model experimental tests of 11 ships in regular head waves the new formulas have more flexible forms and can better fit the test results than other similar models in addition this model proposes a significant wave height based correction factor multiplied to the conventional integration to compute wave resistance in irregular waves this factor is supposed to consider the impact of coupled ship motions in high waves on a ship s added resistance due to waves the model is validated by the full scale measurement from two vessels a pctc and a chemical tanker the encountered weather conditions along the sailing routes are extracted from the reanalysis metocean data the results indicate that the proposed model can provide quite accurate predictions of ship speed loss in head sea operations keywords speed loss irregular sea head wave added resistance due to waves full scale measurements 1 introduction the enhancement of several maritime regulations such as the energy efficiency design index eedi and energy efficiency operational indicator eeoi is promoting the development of energy efficiency measures to reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions imo 2014 2009 the eedi and eeoi emphasize the importance of considering a ship s energy performance in her actual sailing environments where involuntary ship speed losses are expected in adverse sea conditions prpić oršić and faltinsen 2012 brandsæter and vanem 2018 lu et al 2015 a reliable method to describe a ship s speed loss at such environments is often required for both ship design and operations to increase a ship s energy efficiency wang et al 2019 dnv gl 2015 for a ship sailing under a certain sea condition at a specific engine power the speed loss δ v is defined as the involuntary reduction between the ship speed in calm sea condition v c a l m and the real speed v r e a l under the sea environment as 1 δ v v c a l m v r e a l where the speed loss is mainly caused by the added resistance due to wave and wind pérez arribas 2007 normally a ship s total resistance that should be overcome by ship propulsion to push a ship forward is divided into calm water resistance added resistance due to wind and waves and other small effects iso 2015 the calm water resistance and added resistance due to wind are relatively easy to be estimated by model tests or some well developed semi empirical formulas holtrop and mennen 1982 but the accurate estimation of the added resistance due to waves is challenging and it is an essential part for a ship s speed loss prediction three energy components transmitted to the surrounding water are commonly related to the added resistance in waves the first component is the diffraction induced resistance when incident wave reflecting on the ship hull dominating for short waves the second component is the drift force from radiated waves produced by the ship motions in the long wave region the third component is connected viscous effect and is always neglected since the viscous damping is minor compared to the hydrodynamic damping of ship motions thus the added resistance due to waves could be simplified as a non viscous phenomenon and make it possible to scale the resistance from model test to full scale estimation strom tejsen et al 1973 in addition some numerical methods are available to estimate the added resistance due to waves except for the computation expensive computational fluid dynamics cfd methods there are several numerical approaches based on slender body theory or 3d panel method ittc 2018 the development of various methods to estimate added resistance due to waves is briefly summarized in fig 1 havelock 1942 first attempted to calculate the added resistance with the integration of the longitudinal pressure forces over the wetted ship hull in 1970 boese 1970 continued havelock s work via using strip theory named as the direct pressure integration method maruo 1957 proposed a proportional relationship of the added resistance to the square of wave amplitude and stated the superposition principle the basis was then extended to the momentum conservation method which is derived from the momentum balance through the control volume around ship hull maruo 1960 1963 the radiated energy method originally developed by gerritsma and beukelman 1972 was further implemented by salvesen 1978 in parallel to these works faltinsen et al 1980 proposed the asymptotic added resistance calculation formula for wall side ship hull in short wave the aforementioned methods are relatively complicated which more or less rely on the conventional potential flow and strip theory to obtain ship motion response the motion is the first order problem of wave amplitudes but a minor motion difference can lead to a significant deviation of the second order resistance in the numerical analysis in the short wave region the potential flow theory has even reached its limit due to the inevitable viscous effect the calculations normally overestimate the added resistance peak in the long wave region and underestimate such resistances in short waves in addition the time requirement for using those methods is typical in minutes to estimate the resistance at a specific sea state ittc 2018 however energy efficient measures to guide a ship s operation often require immediate answers because estimation in tremendous sea states are often needed such as in ship performance monitoring systems ship voyage optimization systems etc therefore it is necessary to develop fast semi empirical methods for calculating the wave added resistance with satisfactory accuracy while the imo has also called for the simplified formula and divided the development into three different states imo 2013 level 1 the regular head wave level 2 the regular incident waves with arbitrary angles level 3 the irregular wave field scenario in 1975 fujii and takahashi 1975 proposed a well recognized formula namely the nmri national maritime research institute of japan formula for diffraction dominated wave added resistance based on the theoretical solutions from ursell and dean 1947 simultaneously a semi empirical method was proposed by jinkine and ferdinande 1974 to calculate added resistance due to waves in the long wave region for fast cargo ships marin continued to extend the method to short wave and proposed the stawave 1 as well as stawave 2 formula with additional measurement data and recommended by the international towing tank conference ittc 2012 grin 2012 besides ittc 2018 merged maruo s theorem by introducing kochin function in the nmri formula though it is still inefficient because of the mandatory sectional offset integration recently further simplification and combination of the above methods liu and papanikolaou 2016a liu et al 2016 proposed a fast approach based on large public available experiment results with a good estimation capability denoted as ntua sdl simpl or ntua method the ntua method has improved the estimation accuracy of the added resistance in the regular head wave compared to the stawave 2 method but it still cannot give good prediction in comparison with the test resistances of the hsva cruise kvlcc2 tanker and dtc containership particularly for the tail area of short waves with λ l p p 0 3 as shown in fig 2 where r a w is the added resistance due to various regular waves furthermore as the increase of today s ship size the short wave region with lower λ l p p value has become more crucial moreover most of the aforementioned formulas have been proposed validated by model test results there is a lack of public evidence to show their capabilities for predicting a ship s resistance in actual sea environments based on full scale measurement data in this study a new semi empirical approach is proposed by combining the nmri method fujii and takahashi 1975 for the added resistance in short waves and the method from jinkine and ferdinande 1974 for the resistance in long waves furthermore some variables and tuning parameters are introduced in these two methods to better describe a ship s response behavior under different wave regions the estimation by the proposed method for wave induced added resistance in the level 1 regular head wave has been compared with the published experimental tests from 11 ships the accuracy of the estimation has been improved with better fitted resistance curve than the ntua and ittc recommended stawave 2 denoted as ittc sta2 methods moreover based on the calculation of added resistance under regular waves for the level 1 a preliminary correction parameter in terms of significant wave height is proposed to add in the conventional integration method to estimate the added resistance under actual sea states irregular waves in the level 3 this parameter is supposed to consider the severe coupled ship motions in harsher sea conditions finally the capability of the proposed method for estimating wave induced added resistance and speed loss in actual head sea operations is validated showing good agreement with full scale measurements from two ships i e one pure car truck carrier pctc and a chemical tanker some measured ship operation related parameters such as the position heading speed draft and the engine power are adopted for the validation the left part of the paper is organized as follows to describe the proposed method in section 2 the detailed theoretical speed loss estimation model is proposed section 3 presents the development of the proposed semi empirical method to estimate added resistance in regular head waves the proposed method is validated using experimental test data in section 4 section 5 validates the proposed methods using full scale measurement data the results are discussed about the prediction capacity of the proposed method and the uncertainties in section 6 2 theoretical estimation procedure for speed loss prediction in order to predict a ship s speed loss when sailing in certain sea environments it is essential to estimate the ship s actual sailing v r e a l speed under the specific sea conditions and imaginary speeds v c a l m under calm water conditions for a given engine power as fig 3 illustrates the workflow to get such speeds at sea is an iterative process where the initial ship speed is one of the key parameters that determine the estimation similar to the velocity prediction program vpp de jong et al 2009 in comparison with estimating a ship s sailing speeds at a specific sea state it is relatively easy to get the calm water speed v c a l m the relationship between v c a l m and engine power is often given by shipyards as a baseline to guide a ship s navigation and voyage planning for a specific engine setting p s e t t i n g the calm water speed v c a l m can be interpolated from the given baseline in the iterative process for calculation of v r e a l the v c a l m is set as the initial value for the estimation of v r e a l for actually encountered sea states at the specific engine power then a small adjustment v a d j u s t m e n t is added to the input v c a l m to form a guess ship speed which is used to estimate the ship s total resistance and consequently the required power p p r e d i c t i o n when the absolute difference between the specific engine power p s e t t i n g and the calculated engine power p p r e d i c t i o n is less than 5 of p s e t t i n g the iterative process stops the final input ship speed is outputted as the v r e a l for that specific engine power under the given sea wind and wave condition finally the speed loss can be simply evaluated by eq 1 as shown in the red box of fig 3 an accurate module to describe a ship s resistance and propulsion system is essential for the entire estimation process in the following basic ship propulsion models used in this study is briefly presented while special focus is put on the formulas for the added resistance due to head waves 2 1 general concept of ship propulsion a ship s resistance and propulsion systems contain two main modules i e total resistance and propulsion efficiencies let r t o t a l denote the total resistance ships suffered when sailing in a seaway the power required to push a ship to overtake her total resistance with a forward speed through water v is called the effective power p e 2 p e r t o t a l v the effective power p e is transmitted from a ship s engine brake power p b through her shaft system with a shaft transmission efficiency η s and propeller in water with the propulsive efficiency η d as follows carlton 2012 3 p e p b η s η d where η s is normally with values around 0 98 to 0 99 in this study η s is assumed to be 1 for the following analysis the total resistance is typically divided into the calm water resistance r c a l m added resistance due to wave r a w and wind r a a 4 r t o t a l r c a l m r a a r a w accurate calculation of these ship resistance is essential to get a reliable ship speed power performance model when sailing in a seaway 2 2 calm water resistance and added resistance due to wind an approximate calm water resistance calculation method was proposed by holtrop and mennen 1982 based on full scale trails and model experiment the method accounts for the ship main dimensions ship type appendage arrangement immersed transom sterns and the total resistance in still water is divided into six different components as 5 r c a l m r f 1 k 1 r a p p r w r b r t r r a where r f is the frictional resistance here estimated by the ittc 1957 frictional correlation curve ittc 2002 and the form factor 1 k 1 the resistance of appendages r a p p wave resistance of bare hull r w additional resistance from immersed transom r t r model ship correlation resistance r a are calculated by empirical formulas the additional pressure resistance r b due to a bulbous bow presence near the water surface needs to be investigated while the wave resistance r w should consider a reduction due to the action of the bulbous bow as empirical formulas the added resistance due to wind r a a is dependent on the area of structure above the waterline as well as the relative wind speed lewis 1988 in this study it is estimated by the formula given by the international organization standardization iso 2015 6 r a a 1 2 ρ a c a a ψ w r a x v v w r 2 where ρ a is the air mass density a x v is the transverse projected area above waterline including superstructures v w r is the relative wind speed ψ w r is the relative wind direction c a a are the wind resistance coefficients for various heading angles obtained from wind tunnel model tests 2 3 added resistance due to waves under a practical sea state the estimation of a ship s added resistance due to waves r a w under actual sea states irregular waves often starts with getting the wave resistance under a series of regular waves with frequency w with wave amplitude ζ a ω i e r a w ω which can be obtained by either experimental tests semi empirical models or even numerical calculations note that the resistance r a w should also be dependent on a ship s wave heading attacking angles this study only investigates the resistance in the head wave operations as in liu and papanikolaou 2016a and the heading angle is therefore neglected for the simplicity of the following descriptions an actual sea state is normally described by a wave spectrum such as the pierson moskowitz wave spectrum pierson and moskowitz 1964 dependent on the significant wave height h s wave peak period t p sometimes an extra peak enhancement factor γ is added to the spectrum to allow for flexible spectrum shapes such as the jonswap spectrum hasselmann et al 1973 in this study the jonswap spectrum is used for the added wave resistance estimations and expressed by 7 s ω h s t p γ 320 h s 2 t p 4 ω 5 exp 1950 t p 4 ω 4 γ exp ω ω p 2 2 σ 2 ω p 2 while the spectral width parameters σ 0 07 for ω ω p σ 0 09 when ω ω p the newly developed semi empirical head wave added resistance formula has been applied in this study which is derived in the following section for a given sea state of wave spectrum s ω h s t p γ the added resistance due to its irregular waves can be estimated by the linear integration of the resistances from its regular wave components of all wave frequencies as shown 8 r a w h s t p γ 2 0 s ω h s t p γ r a w w ζ a ω 2 d ω it should be noted that since the main focus of this study is to investigate and propose various methods formulas for getting the accurate added resistance due to waves and the corresponding ship speed loss to mitigate the effect of possible errors from methods in getting r c a l m and r a a for the case study ship of full scale measurements the results from the towing tank tests and wind tunnel measurements are used to get the corresponding calm water resistance and the wind resistance coefficients for this ship 3 improved semi empirical models for r a w ω in head waves added resistance due to waves is generally regarded as a non viscous phenomenon the added resistance in regular waves again in head waves of frequency ω can be separated into two components i e added resistance due to wave reflection r a w r ω and added resistance due to ship motions r a w m ω strom tejsen et al 1973 9 r a w ω r a w r ω r a w m ω where r a w r and r a w m are assumed to be uncoupled in this paper it is recognized that the wave reflection induced resistance r a w r is mainly caused by short waves large values of ω while the wave motions induced resistance r a w m is mainly caused by long waves small ω therefore the development of models for r a w r focuses on short waves and for r a w m on long waves by inventorying all the recent development of semi empirical formulas for these two added resistance components it is concluded that the model of r a w r based on the nmri formulas fujii and takahashi 1975 has a good capability to describe wave resistance in short waves and for the added resistance due to wave induced motions r a w m the model proposed by jinkine and ferdinande 1974 has a good description of wave resistance for long waves therefore in this study these two models are further developed to improve the accuracy of the semi empirical models for the analysis of added resistance due to waves 3 1 improved models for added resistance due to wave reflection the original nmri semi empirical formula to compute the added resistance due to wave was initially introduced four decades ago by fujii and takahashi 1975 now it is adopted to compute added resistance due to wave reflections for short waves by 10 r a w r n m r i 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 b b f α t 1 α u where the fluid density ρ gravitational acceleration g ship width b bluntness coefficient b f draft coefficient α t and advance coefficient 1 α u the advance coefficient 1 α u was further developed takahashi 1988 kuroda et al 2008 tsujimoto et al 2008 based on the supplementary experiment data as 11 1 α u 1 c u f n where c u max 310 b f 68 10 while c u is correlated to the bluntness coefficient the bluntness coefficient b f is always estimated by integration method considering the shape of the water plane as well as wave direction the value of b f is highly correlated to the block coefficient c b and can be simplified as an approximation expression liu and papanikolaou 2016a 12 b f 2 25 sin 2 e the average entrance angle e is defined by ship width b and length of entrance l e 13 e arctan b 2 l e different from the original nmri formula the length of entrance l e has been modified to be the length between the fore perpendicular and the point where it reaches 99 ship width at the waterline surface in liu et al 2016 in addition instead of using bessel function to estimate the draft coefficient α t as in the nmri model it is modified to α t 1 e 2 k t considering the fact that the exponential decay is observed to be more equivalent to the real physical wave energy dissipation liu et al 2016 valanto and hong 2015 although the original nmri semi empirical models have been continuously further developed to better estimate the added resistance due to wave reflections it has a weak theoretical estimation capacity in the short wave region especially when λ 0 3 l p p more specifically it cannot catch up with the tail increase for the high frequency short wave reflections for example this weakness of the nmri models is presented in fig 4 for the model tests from dtc container kvlcc2 tanker and hsva cruise model presented in e g liu et al 2016 valanto and hong 2015 liu and papanikolaou 2016b guo and steen 2011 sadat hosseini et al 2013 moctar et al 2015 therefore in this paper a wave length correction factor was tuned and added in the original nmri semi empirical model viz 14 r a w r 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 b b f α t 1 α u 0 19 c b λ l p p f n 1 11 where the wave length correction factor is settled by block coefficient c b froude number f n and the ratio between wave length λ and ship length l p p furthermore k e t is proposed to replace k t as the non dimensional frequency in the draft coefficient 15 α t 1 e 2 k e t where k e k 1 ω cos β 2 and ω ω v g the circular frequency of incident regular waves ω wave number of incident regular waves k the new modified formulas have presented more flexible prediction performance in the short wave region as shown in fig 4 where the proposed formula of eq 14 in this study is denoted as cth this flexible formula can help to match the reasonable resistance increase in the extremely short wave regions 3 2 improved models for added resistance due to ship motions in parallel to the research development of added wave resistance by fujii and takahashi 1975 during the 1970s a separate semi empirical model was developed by jinkine and ferdinande 1974 based on the experiment data of a fine hull fast cargo ship this model is found to be a reasonable approximation of added resistance for long waves and often used as a basis for the succeeding development in e g ittc and other research communities to estimate added wave resistance due to ship motions the original model is written as 16 r a w m j f 4 ρ g ζ a 2 b 2 l p p ω b 1 exp b 1 d 1 1 ω d 1 a 1 a 2 where a 1 is the amplitude factor a 2 is the speed correction factor b 1 and d 1 are the slope adjustment factors and ω is the frequency factor the amplitude factor originally proposed by jinkine and ferdinande 1974 has been continually modified the most recent development was proposed by liu and papanikolaou 2016a and further tuned in this study and expressed by 17 a 1 60 3 c b 1 34 1 c b 1 f n while block coefficient c b and froude number f n were used as modification parameters the speed correction factor a 2 in eq 16 has also been extended to the speed span of 0 f n 0 3 compared to the original high speed domain ittc 2012 grin 2012 liu and papanikolaou 2016a in this study through the careful analysis of all collected experimental data it is found that the speed correction factor a 2 is susceptible to the longitudinal radius of gyration k y y and the block coefficient c b in high speed region and it has a little bit steeper slope compared to the ntua formula when f n 0 12 hence the following formula is consequently proposed 18 a 2 0 0072 0 24 f n for f n 0 12 f n 1 05 c b 2 3 exp 2 k y y 0 25 k y y 0 25 f n for f n 0 12 where the ceiling function k y y 0 25 and floor function k y y 0 25 can give discrete scales for f n concerning the correlation between k y y and the typical value 0 25 ittc 2017 the proposed eq 18 can consider the k y y variation for different types of ships the value of k y y is fitted with the peak value of those experiment measurements the improvement for estimating added resistance due to ship motions r a w m is presented as 6 cases in fig 5 for example fig 5 a shows the comparison between the ntua method and the proposed method with two model tests for f n 0 12 while fig 5 b presents two comparison cases for f n 0 12 the frequency factor ω is determined by the frequency of heave and pitch motions which resonance response of these motions is regarded as the leading cause of radiation induced added resistance reaching the peak value in head sea liu and papanikolaou 2016a separated the expression to lower and normal speed whereas it is still not able to match the experimental data well for some cases when k y y do not equal to 0 25 especially for hsva cruise valanto and hong 2015 it is also observed that the resonance frequency moves horizontally from λ l p p 1 to λ l p p 1 as the froude number f n increase the trend is influenced by the longitudinal radius of gyration variation as well consequently the expression is further parameter tuned in this study and the modified formula is given by 19 ω l p p g k y y l p p c 1 0 0 5 0 143 1 09 k y y 0 25 0 08 ω for f n 0 05 l p p g k y y l p p c 1 f n 0 143 1 09 k y y 0 25 0 08 ω for f n 0 05 where the root c 1 0 4567 c b k y y 1 689 and the improved expression results are closer to the resonance position assumed as the highest resistance position in experiment measurements as shown in fig 5 c furthermore in this study the slope adjustment is also calibrated with respect to the longitudinal radius of gyration k y y and the block coefficient c b 20 b 1 19 77 c b k y y 36 39 k y y 0 25 for ω 1 c b 0 75 11 k y y 0 25 for ω 1 c b 0 75 12 5 k y y 0 25 for ω 1 c b 0 75 5 5 k y y 0 25 for ω 1 c b 0 75 21 d 1 14 for ω 1 c b 0 75 566 l p p b 2 66 2 for ω 1 c b 0 75 566 l p p b 2 66 6 elsewhere while c b 0 75 is adopted as the boundary to define the piece wise the final calculated non dimensional curves demonstrate much better slope peak matching to the model tests 3 3 the proposed semi empirical model for r a w in this study a wave length correction is proposed to be added in the nmri semi empirical model fujii and takahashi 1975 whose draft coefficient is also further modified to consider actual wave energy dissipation when sailing in waves this model is used to estimate added resistance in short waves i e due to wave reflections r a w r in eq 9 furthermore the semi empirical model by jinkine and ferdinande 1974 is further developed by improving the speed correction factor a 2 frequency factor ω slope adjustment b 1 and d 1 the latter developed model is used to estimate added resistance in long waves i e due to wave motions r a w m in eq 9 the summation of the two models leads to the total added resistance due to waves as in eq 9 to summary the evolution of present development of the added resistance r a w for head waves the entire semi empirical model proposed in this study denoted as the cth model is listed in box i 4 validation of the proposed model using model tests in regular head waves the proposed semi empirical model in section 3 is compared with the aforementioned ittc sta2 ntua method for the estimation of added resistance in head waves a number of available ship model test measurements were collected to validate the proposal model i e s175 container fujii and takahashi 1975 takahashi 1988 kvlcc2 tanker guo and steen 2011 sadat hosseini et al 2013 dtc container liu and papanikolaou 2016b moctar et al 2012 hsva cruise valanto and hong 2015 s a van der stel alexandersson 2009 a bulk carrier kadomatsu 1988 and series 60 models with five various block coefficient c b strom tejsen et al 1973 all the required parameters of these studied ships required in the semi empirical models are listed in table 1 for the validation of the proposal semi empirical model and comparison with other methods in addition to illustrated figures to plot the estimated resistance r a w against the model test results the mean squared error mse by hastie et al 2009 is used as an estimator to quantitatively compare the accuracy of those models for each ship model test at a given speed f n under a series of regular waves with frequency ω i i 1 2 n the mse can be calculated by 22 mse 1 n i 1 n r a w ω i r a w ω i 2 where r a w ω i represents the measured resistance and r a w ω i represents the estimated resistance such as by eq 9 or the ntua ittc sta2 methods some typical model test cases selected from six different ships are presented in fig 6 which presents the added resistance due to waves r a w estimated by the proposed method the ittc sta2 method and the ntua method in comparison with the model test results the comparison of those methods for all the available test ships listed in table 1 are presented in the appendix from figs a 13 to a 23 as fig 6 c shows the proposed formula has significantly improved added resistance estimation for the hsva cruise either in the short wave field tail increase or the long wave field peak value seizing similarly that has resulted in better performance in the resonance region and peak catching for bulk carrier in fig 6 a and s175 container in fig 6 e the ntua approach can surely catch the peak and the resonance region whereas the prediction capacity in the short wave field cannot perform as well as the proposed formula obviously the ittc sta2 method has underestimated for almost all cases furthermore the mses of the added resistance due to waves r a w for the proposed cth model the ittc sta2 model and the ntua model are computed for all the experimental model tests in order to have an easy comparison all the computed mses are normalized in terms of the values from the proposed cth formulas and the corresponding results are listed in table 2 it should be noted that large values of mse mean bad estimation of that method in comparison with the proposed cth formulas as the table expresses the proposed formulas in section 3 3 have the best prediction performance for almost all the studied instances expect 3 cases the best is the ntua model and 1 case the best is the ittc sta2 model in general the proposed semi empirical formulas have shown superior estimation ability than the other considered approaches for the level 1 wave resistance estimation under regular head sea conditions therefore it was adopted in the proposed speed loss prediction model to estimate added resistance due to waves the capability of the speed loss prediction model will be investigated by full scale measurements in the following analysis 5 model validation by full scale measurements at actual head sea conditions the full scale measurements in this paper were recorded from one pctc and one chemical tanker they were instrumented with several sensors and equipment to collect a large amount of ship energy performance related data up to a gigabyte per day the main particulars of these two ships are shown in table 3 and applied as inputs for the following ship resistance calculation for this study the measurement data types from the two ships are quite similar it includes the shaft power and torque along with the rpm from engine rooms the ship draft from the stern and stem longitude latitude speed over ground speed through water and ship headings etc along with the sailing voyages the measurements were recorded with a frequency of 1 hz i e data collection every second while the raw measurements are statistically evaluated every 15 min and erroneous data is filtered for example several typical routes during the sailing recorded by the full scale measurement campaign are illustrated in fig 7 in addition to the two ships main particulars and performance measurement data their baselines obtained from model tests and sea trials such as speed power relationship in calm water conditions wind resistance coefficients etc are provided by shipowners for this study see fig 8 while the wind resistance coefficients c a a measured through wind tunnel tests were adopted for the case study ships the propulsive efficiency η d is extracted from the ship model self propulsion tests at the designed draft for various ship speeds since only full loading condition is considered in this validation study when full scale measurements are used in this study the η d is interpolated from the self propulsion tests for any measured ship speed it should be noted that the propulsion efficiency η d for a ship s actual sailing in waves should be different from that obtained from the experiment tests even for the same ship speed in this study the difference is included in the added resistance in waves 5 1 metocean data for the prediction of a ship s energy performance in a seaway it is the most essential to get accurate sea environments encountered along the ship s sailing routes for these two case study ships the encountered metocean environments i e the mean wave direction d w a v e mean wave period t z significant wave height h s wind speed u w i n d and v w i n d are extracted from the ecmwf reanalysis dataset era5 hourly with 0 25 0 25 degree spatial resolution copernicus 2019 the information of current velocity u c u r r e n t and v c u r r e n t are obtained from the copernicus marine server with the same geographical resolution and the temporal resolution is 24 h cmems 2019 the extracted metocean environments from the hindcast datasets are assumed to be the actually encountered conditions the two ships loaded condition was pulled out from the huge amount of real measurements based on the draft analysis and the relative wave angle along with wind angle were estimated in order to decrease the uncertainty and enrich the studied dataset the relative wave angle between 0 to 10 is considered as the head sea 5 2 the wave height correction factor for wave resistance in head sea based on the analysis of added resistance in waves from the full scale measurements of those two ships it is found that there is a steeper rise in the added resistance as the significant wave height h s increase compared to the linear superposition calculation by the eq 8 it can be caused by the coupled ship motions in severe sea wave condition and rudder induced resistance controlled by the autopilot besides the propulsion efficiency may also be reduced due to the big motions such as the propeller out of water consequently a wave height correction factor c h s h s 3 5 was preliminary proposed and recommended in the added resistance estimation in the real irregular sea conditions viz 23 r a w h s t p γ 2 0 s ω h s t p γ r a w w ζ a ω 2 d ω h s 3 5 in the following comparison analysis for a chosen engine power with the full scale measurements of sailing speed and wave environments h s t z encountered by a case study ship the added resistance due to waves r a w can be estimated by the inverse procedure in fig 3 first the propulsive efficiency η d corresponding to the ship speed v is interpolated from the ship s self propulsion tests then the total resistance r t o t a l is estimated from the engine power p b ship speed v and η d by eqs 2 3 while r c a l m is interpolated from the ship s speed power curve obtained from model tests the added resistance due to wind r a a is evaluated by the eq 6 the actual added resistance due to wave is calculated as r a w r t o t a l r c a l m r a a then an average value and the standard deviation of r a w for the picked engine power speed and wave condition are computed as the reference to be compared with the proposed method the added resistance due to regular head waves r a w under the same speed are calculated by the proposed method in section 3 3 finally the added resistances under actually irregular sea state r a w are computed by both the conventional method without wave height correction as eq 8 and the proposed method with wave height correction as eq 23 where the peak enhancement factor in the jonswap wave spectrum is chosen to be γ 3 3 and γ 1 pierson moskowitz spectrum to investigate the sensitivity of r a w to the shape of a wave spectrum this calculation process is performed several times for various power speed and wave conditions as shown in fig 9 the measurements with engine power around 8800 kw are used for the resistance verification for the studied pctc it has been sailing in calm sea conditions with a maximum significant wave height of less than 3 5 m four wave conditions with significant wave height approximately 0 9 m 1 7 m 2 7 m and 3 4 m are evaluated both the mean and standard deviation of r a w from the measurements are presented in fig 9 again there is a sharp nonlinear increase of r a w against the encountered significant wave height the proposed semi empirical models using wave spectrum with γ 3 3 and wave height correction factor c h s gives very good results of r a w in comparison with the measurement although it has a little bit underestimation for h s 1 7 m for the case study chemical tanker a long time of full scale measurement data is available in this study harsh encountered sea environments with h s more than 8 m can be found from the measurement data the chemical tanker is operated using a power based navigation strategy i e different power settings are used according to encountered sea conditions the power setting onboard the ship is configured into various so called eco setting levels such as eco 2 setting 6660 kw to 7270 kw for relative calm wave eco 5 setting 4830 kw to 5440 kw for severer sea and eco 6 setting 4220 kw to 4830 kw for harsh sea conditions similar calculations for the pctc are performed for the chemical tanker at the above three engine eco setting levels the corresponding results are presented in fig 10 it is again clearly indicated that the γ 3 3 combined with the wave height correction factor has achieved the best prediction performance for almost all the studied cases from h s less than 1 m to h s larger than 7 m it was also observed that except for the significant wave height and ship speed the peak period has a vital influence on the added resistance in waves for the cases h s 6 6 m and h s 7 1 m with eco 6 setting the wave period is almost two times than the cases h s 4 1 m and h s 5 0 with eco 5 setting leading smaller resistance though they have larger wave height it should be noted that for the extraordinary case of h s 8 2 m in fig 10 bottom plot the added wave resistance r a w estimated by the proposed method differs significantly from the measured values the big difference might be caused by that the propulsion efficiency has been dramatically reduced due to the propeller out of the water surface under such large waves furthermore another reason might be that the proposed wave height correction factor needed to be further increased to account for the extensive motions when sailing in so severe wave environments in general the proposed semi empirical models as eq 23 with r a w estimated by eq 9 gives quite good estimations of added wave resistance r a w in comparison with measurement when a proper wave spectrum is used 5 3 validation of the proposed method for speed loss prediction by full scale measurements in order to check the accuracy of the proposed method for the prediction of a ship s speed loss when sailing in actual irregular head wave conditions a fixed power for the case study ships should be first defined then all the sailing waypoints encountering head waves are selected from the measurement data in this study the engine power of around 8800 kw 60 mcr for the pctc and 4300 kw 52 mcr for the chemical tanker for the following speed loss analysis the next is to divide all the selected waypoints into various groups based on their encountered wave environments for example for the pctc ship five groups of sea states are defined with significant wave heights h s approximately to 0 3 m 0 7 m 1 2 m 2 0 m and 3 1 m for the chemical tanker with long period of measurement data five groups of more scattered sea states are defined with significant wave heights h s approximately to 1 4 m 2 0 m 3 2 m 6 6 m and 7 1 m while the values of h s within the range of 0 05 m are regarded as the same sea states for the pctc and the chemical tanker at the defined engine power settings their speeds under calm water conditions v c a l m are computed to be 16 9 kn and 12 8 kn respectively then for each individual sea state the real sailing speeds v r e a l are estimated using the procedures presented in fig 3 where the added resistance due to waves are estimated by the proposed method furthermore the actual sailing speeds v r e a l under all these sea states are calculated as the mean values of the measured speeds for all those waypoints with the same sea state the comparison of v r e a l between the measured mean values and the estimated by the proposed method is presented in figs 11 and 12 for the pctc and the chemical tanker respectively as illustrated in the two figures the maximum speed loss for the case study pctc at h s 3 1 m is about 2 4 kn i e 14 involuntary speed reduction caused by the sea environments for the chemical tanker due to the highest encountered sea states of h s 7 1 m the maximum speed loss is 4 9 kn i e about 40 in voluntary speed reduction it should be noted that under this very high sea state the chemical tanker s power was already reduced by about 40 in comparison with her normal service conditions if one compares the actual measured speeds and the estimated speeds in general the proposed models show consistently excellent prediction through all considered wave conditions for the case study pctc with a maximum difference of about 0 2 kn the same agreement has also been observed for the chemical tanker in fig 12 while the validation cases start from h s 1 4 m to the harsh sea condition with significant wave height more than 7 m 4 5 h s 5 5 m was skipped because of too little measurements in that range it should be noted that for the pctc in fig 11 there is a consistently slight underestimation of added resistance due to waves leading to higher estimated speeds v r e a l while there is also an almost consistently slight overestimation of added resistance for the chemical tanker it might indicate that a ship type related correction factor should be considered in the proposed model for speed power modeling since the difference is small it will not be further investigated in this study 6 conclusions this study proposed several improvements of current semi empirical models for a ship s speed loss prediction when sailing in head sea conditions it includes improved semi empirical formulas for added resistance due to regular head waves through combining the further developed nmri formulas fujii and takahashi 1975 for short waves due to wave reflections and the improved semi empirical models from jinkine and ferdinande 1974 for long waves due to wave motions the improved semi empirical models have been validated by an abundant of published experimental data in regular waves with sufficiently accurate approximations compared to the other two existed well known approaches furthermore a special contribution in this study is to propose a wave height correction factor in the conventional formula by integrating wave spectrum with the semi empirical added resistance in regular waves to estimate the added resistance due to actual sea states irregular waves described by wave spectrum two case study ships with full scale measurements available are used to verify the proposed models for both the estimation of added resistance and speed loss prediction due to actual sea states the measurements recorded among others ship speed heading position and shaft power etc while the reanalysis sea environmental data are applied to obtain the wave and wind conditions along with the measured sailing voyages for the added resistance due to irregular head waves the proposed models with the wave height correction factor using the jonswap wave spectrum give very good estimations in comparison with measured values for most of the investigated sea states one exceptional case is for the extremely harsh sea state with h s of more than 8 2 m even the extra added wave height factor still seriously underestimates the added resistance because the extreme waves caused motions may affect the estimation of propulsion efficiencies in the analysis for the speed loss prediction under actual sailing sea environments significant speed losses are observed from the two ships measurement data with a maximum 14 speed reduction at h s of 3 meters for the pctc and 40 speed reduction for the chemical tanker at h s of 7 meters in addition to certain voluntary speed reduction the proposed models give excellent results in comparison with the measured results for both ships the good agreement is obtained even for the high waves of h s of more than 7 m in general the proposed semi empirical models

21784,this paper proposes a semi empirical model to estimate a ship s speed loss at head sea in the model the formulas to estimate a ship s added resistance due to waves have been further developed to better consider the ship hull forms in addition to other main particulars based on the model experimental tests of 11 ships in regular head waves the new formulas have more flexible forms and can better fit the test results than other similar models in addition this model proposes a significant wave height based correction factor multiplied to the conventional integration to compute wave resistance in irregular waves this factor is supposed to consider the impact of coupled ship motions in high waves on a ship s added resistance due to waves the model is validated by the full scale measurement from two vessels a pctc and a chemical tanker the encountered weather conditions along the sailing routes are extracted from the reanalysis metocean data the results indicate that the proposed model can provide quite accurate predictions of ship speed loss in head sea operations keywords speed loss irregular sea head wave added resistance due to waves full scale measurements 1 introduction the enhancement of several maritime regulations such as the energy efficiency design index eedi and energy efficiency operational indicator eeoi is promoting the development of energy efficiency measures to reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions imo 2014 2009 the eedi and eeoi emphasize the importance of considering a ship s energy performance in her actual sailing environments where involuntary ship speed losses are expected in adverse sea conditions prpić oršić and faltinsen 2012 brandsæter and vanem 2018 lu et al 2015 a reliable method to describe a ship s speed loss at such environments is often required for both ship design and operations to increase a ship s energy efficiency wang et al 2019 dnv gl 2015 for a ship sailing under a certain sea condition at a specific engine power the speed loss δ v is defined as the involuntary reduction between the ship speed in calm sea condition v c a l m and the real speed v r e a l under the sea environment as 1 δ v v c a l m v r e a l where the speed loss is mainly caused by the added resistance due to wave and wind pérez arribas 2007 normally a ship s total resistance that should be overcome by ship propulsion to push a ship forward is divided into calm water resistance added resistance due to wind and waves and other small effects iso 2015 the calm water resistance and added resistance due to wind are relatively easy to be estimated by model tests or some well developed semi empirical formulas holtrop and mennen 1982 but the accurate estimation of the added resistance due to waves is challenging and it is an essential part for a ship s speed loss prediction three energy components transmitted to the surrounding water are commonly related to the added resistance in waves the first component is the diffraction induced resistance when incident wave reflecting on the ship hull dominating for short waves the second component is the drift force from radiated waves produced by the ship motions in the long wave region the third component is connected viscous effect and is always neglected since the viscous damping is minor compared to the hydrodynamic damping of ship motions thus the added resistance due to waves could be simplified as a non viscous phenomenon and make it possible to scale the resistance from model test to full scale estimation strom tejsen et al 1973 in addition some numerical methods are available to estimate the added resistance due to waves except for the computation expensive computational fluid dynamics cfd methods there are several numerical approaches based on slender body theory or 3d panel method ittc 2018 the development of various methods to estimate added resistance due to waves is briefly summarized in fig 1 havelock 1942 first attempted to calculate the added resistance with the integration of the longitudinal pressure forces over the wetted ship hull in 1970 boese 1970 continued havelock s work via using strip theory named as the direct pressure integration method maruo 1957 proposed a proportional relationship of the added resistance to the square of wave amplitude and stated the superposition principle the basis was then extended to the momentum conservation method which is derived from the momentum balance through the control volume around ship hull maruo 1960 1963 the radiated energy method originally developed by gerritsma and beukelman 1972 was further implemented by salvesen 1978 in parallel to these works faltinsen et al 1980 proposed the asymptotic added resistance calculation formula for wall side ship hull in short wave the aforementioned methods are relatively complicated which more or less rely on the conventional potential flow and strip theory to obtain ship motion response the motion is the first order problem of wave amplitudes but a minor motion difference can lead to a significant deviation of the second order resistance in the numerical analysis in the short wave region the potential flow theory has even reached its limit due to the inevitable viscous effect the calculations normally overestimate the added resistance peak in the long wave region and underestimate such resistances in short waves in addition the time requirement for using those methods is typical in minutes to estimate the resistance at a specific sea state ittc 2018 however energy efficient measures to guide a ship s operation often require immediate answers because estimation in tremendous sea states are often needed such as in ship performance monitoring systems ship voyage optimization systems etc therefore it is necessary to develop fast semi empirical methods for calculating the wave added resistance with satisfactory accuracy while the imo has also called for the simplified formula and divided the development into three different states imo 2013 level 1 the regular head wave level 2 the regular incident waves with arbitrary angles level 3 the irregular wave field scenario in 1975 fujii and takahashi 1975 proposed a well recognized formula namely the nmri national maritime research institute of japan formula for diffraction dominated wave added resistance based on the theoretical solutions from ursell and dean 1947 simultaneously a semi empirical method was proposed by jinkine and ferdinande 1974 to calculate added resistance due to waves in the long wave region for fast cargo ships marin continued to extend the method to short wave and proposed the stawave 1 as well as stawave 2 formula with additional measurement data and recommended by the international towing tank conference ittc 2012 grin 2012 besides ittc 2018 merged maruo s theorem by introducing kochin function in the nmri formula though it is still inefficient because of the mandatory sectional offset integration recently further simplification and combination of the above methods liu and papanikolaou 2016a liu et al 2016 proposed a fast approach based on large public available experiment results with a good estimation capability denoted as ntua sdl simpl or ntua method the ntua method has improved the estimation accuracy of the added resistance in the regular head wave compared to the stawave 2 method but it still cannot give good prediction in comparison with the test resistances of the hsva cruise kvlcc2 tanker and dtc containership particularly for the tail area of short waves with λ l p p 0 3 as shown in fig 2 where r a w is the added resistance due to various regular waves furthermore as the increase of today s ship size the short wave region with lower λ l p p value has become more crucial moreover most of the aforementioned formulas have been proposed validated by model test results there is a lack of public evidence to show their capabilities for predicting a ship s resistance in actual sea environments based on full scale measurement data in this study a new semi empirical approach is proposed by combining the nmri method fujii and takahashi 1975 for the added resistance in short waves and the method from jinkine and ferdinande 1974 for the resistance in long waves furthermore some variables and tuning parameters are introduced in these two methods to better describe a ship s response behavior under different wave regions the estimation by the proposed method for wave induced added resistance in the level 1 regular head wave has been compared with the published experimental tests from 11 ships the accuracy of the estimation has been improved with better fitted resistance curve than the ntua and ittc recommended stawave 2 denoted as ittc sta2 methods moreover based on the calculation of added resistance under regular waves for the level 1 a preliminary correction parameter in terms of significant wave height is proposed to add in the conventional integration method to estimate the added resistance under actual sea states irregular waves in the level 3 this parameter is supposed to consider the severe coupled ship motions in harsher sea conditions finally the capability of the proposed method for estimating wave induced added resistance and speed loss in actual head sea operations is validated showing good agreement with full scale measurements from two ships i e one pure car truck carrier pctc and a chemical tanker some measured ship operation related parameters such as the position heading speed draft and the engine power are adopted for the validation the left part of the paper is organized as follows to describe the proposed method in section 2 the detailed theoretical speed loss estimation model is proposed section 3 presents the development of the proposed semi empirical method to estimate added resistance in regular head waves the proposed method is validated using experimental test data in section 4 section 5 validates the proposed methods using full scale measurement data the results are discussed about the prediction capacity of the proposed method and the uncertainties in section 6 2 theoretical estimation procedure for speed loss prediction in order to predict a ship s speed loss when sailing in certain sea environments it is essential to estimate the ship s actual sailing v r e a l speed under the specific sea conditions and imaginary speeds v c a l m under calm water conditions for a given engine power as fig 3 illustrates the workflow to get such speeds at sea is an iterative process where the initial ship speed is one of the key parameters that determine the estimation similar to the velocity prediction program vpp de jong et al 2009 in comparison with estimating a ship s sailing speeds at a specific sea state it is relatively easy to get the calm water speed v c a l m the relationship between v c a l m and engine power is often given by shipyards as a baseline to guide a ship s navigation and voyage planning for a specific engine setting p s e t t i n g the calm water speed v c a l m can be interpolated from the given baseline in the iterative process for calculation of v r e a l the v c a l m is set as the initial value for the estimation of v r e a l for actually encountered sea states at the specific engine power then a small adjustment v a d j u s t m e n t is added to the input v c a l m to form a guess ship speed which is used to estimate the ship s total resistance and consequently the required power p p r e d i c t i o n when the absolute difference between the specific engine power p s e t t i n g and the calculated engine power p p r e d i c t i o n is less than 5 of p s e t t i n g the iterative process stops the final input ship speed is outputted as the v r e a l for that specific engine power under the given sea wind and wave condition finally the speed loss can be simply evaluated by eq 1 as shown in the red box of fig 3 an accurate module to describe a ship s resistance and propulsion system is essential for the entire estimation process in the following basic ship propulsion models used in this study is briefly presented while special focus is put on the formulas for the added resistance due to head waves 2 1 general concept of ship propulsion a ship s resistance and propulsion systems contain two main modules i e total resistance and propulsion efficiencies let r t o t a l denote the total resistance ships suffered when sailing in a seaway the power required to push a ship to overtake her total resistance with a forward speed through water v is called the effective power p e 2 p e r t o t a l v the effective power p e is transmitted from a ship s engine brake power p b through her shaft system with a shaft transmission efficiency η s and propeller in water with the propulsive efficiency η d as follows carlton 2012 3 p e p b η s η d where η s is normally with values around 0 98 to 0 99 in this study η s is assumed to be 1 for the following analysis the total resistance is typically divided into the calm water resistance r c a l m added resistance due to wave r a w and wind r a a 4 r t o t a l r c a l m r a a r a w accurate calculation of these ship resistance is essential to get a reliable ship speed power performance model when sailing in a seaway 2 2 calm water resistance and added resistance due to wind an approximate calm water resistance calculation method was proposed by holtrop and mennen 1982 based on full scale trails and model experiment the method accounts for the ship main dimensions ship type appendage arrangement immersed transom sterns and the total resistance in still water is divided into six different components as 5 r c a l m r f 1 k 1 r a p p r w r b r t r r a where r f is the frictional resistance here estimated by the ittc 1957 frictional correlation curve ittc 2002 and the form factor 1 k 1 the resistance of appendages r a p p wave resistance of bare hull r w additional resistance from immersed transom r t r model ship correlation resistance r a are calculated by empirical formulas the additional pressure resistance r b due to a bulbous bow presence near the water surface needs to be investigated while the wave resistance r w should consider a reduction due to the action of the bulbous bow as empirical formulas the added resistance due to wind r a a is dependent on the area of structure above the waterline as well as the relative wind speed lewis 1988 in this study it is estimated by the formula given by the international organization standardization iso 2015 6 r a a 1 2 ρ a c a a ψ w r a x v v w r 2 where ρ a is the air mass density a x v is the transverse projected area above waterline including superstructures v w r is the relative wind speed ψ w r is the relative wind direction c a a are the wind resistance coefficients for various heading angles obtained from wind tunnel model tests 2 3 added resistance due to waves under a practical sea state the estimation of a ship s added resistance due to waves r a w under actual sea states irregular waves often starts with getting the wave resistance under a series of regular waves with frequency w with wave amplitude ζ a ω i e r a w ω which can be obtained by either experimental tests semi empirical models or even numerical calculations note that the resistance r a w should also be dependent on a ship s wave heading attacking angles this study only investigates the resistance in the head wave operations as in liu and papanikolaou 2016a and the heading angle is therefore neglected for the simplicity of the following descriptions an actual sea state is normally described by a wave spectrum such as the pierson moskowitz wave spectrum pierson and moskowitz 1964 dependent on the significant wave height h s wave peak period t p sometimes an extra peak enhancement factor γ is added to the spectrum to allow for flexible spectrum shapes such as the jonswap spectrum hasselmann et al 1973 in this study the jonswap spectrum is used for the added wave resistance estimations and expressed by 7 s ω h s t p γ 320 h s 2 t p 4 ω 5 exp 1950 t p 4 ω 4 γ exp ω ω p 2 2 σ 2 ω p 2 while the spectral width parameters σ 0 07 for ω ω p σ 0 09 when ω ω p the newly developed semi empirical head wave added resistance formula has been applied in this study which is derived in the following section for a given sea state of wave spectrum s ω h s t p γ the added resistance due to its irregular waves can be estimated by the linear integration of the resistances from its regular wave components of all wave frequencies as shown 8 r a w h s t p γ 2 0 s ω h s t p γ r a w w ζ a ω 2 d ω it should be noted that since the main focus of this study is to investigate and propose various methods formulas for getting the accurate added resistance due to waves and the corresponding ship speed loss to mitigate the effect of possible errors from methods in getting r c a l m and r a a for the case study ship of full scale measurements the results from the towing tank tests and wind tunnel measurements are used to get the corresponding calm water resistance and the wind resistance coefficients for this ship 3 improved semi empirical models for r a w ω in head waves added resistance due to waves is generally regarded as a non viscous phenomenon the added resistance in regular waves again in head waves of frequency ω can be separated into two components i e added resistance due to wave reflection r a w r ω and added resistance due to ship motions r a w m ω strom tejsen et al 1973 9 r a w ω r a w r ω r a w m ω where r a w r and r a w m are assumed to be uncoupled in this paper it is recognized that the wave reflection induced resistance r a w r is mainly caused by short waves large values of ω while the wave motions induced resistance r a w m is mainly caused by long waves small ω therefore the development of models for r a w r focuses on short waves and for r a w m on long waves by inventorying all the recent development of semi empirical formulas for these two added resistance components it is concluded that the model of r a w r based on the nmri formulas fujii and takahashi 1975 has a good capability to describe wave resistance in short waves and for the added resistance due to wave induced motions r a w m the model proposed by jinkine and ferdinande 1974 has a good description of wave resistance for long waves therefore in this study these two models are further developed to improve the accuracy of the semi empirical models for the analysis of added resistance due to waves 3 1 improved models for added resistance due to wave reflection the original nmri semi empirical formula to compute the added resistance due to wave was initially introduced four decades ago by fujii and takahashi 1975 now it is adopted to compute added resistance due to wave reflections for short waves by 10 r a w r n m r i 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 b b f α t 1 α u where the fluid density ρ gravitational acceleration g ship width b bluntness coefficient b f draft coefficient α t and advance coefficient 1 α u the advance coefficient 1 α u was further developed takahashi 1988 kuroda et al 2008 tsujimoto et al 2008 based on the supplementary experiment data as 11 1 α u 1 c u f n where c u max 310 b f 68 10 while c u is correlated to the bluntness coefficient the bluntness coefficient b f is always estimated by integration method considering the shape of the water plane as well as wave direction the value of b f is highly correlated to the block coefficient c b and can be simplified as an approximation expression liu and papanikolaou 2016a 12 b f 2 25 sin 2 e the average entrance angle e is defined by ship width b and length of entrance l e 13 e arctan b 2 l e different from the original nmri formula the length of entrance l e has been modified to be the length between the fore perpendicular and the point where it reaches 99 ship width at the waterline surface in liu et al 2016 in addition instead of using bessel function to estimate the draft coefficient α t as in the nmri model it is modified to α t 1 e 2 k t considering the fact that the exponential decay is observed to be more equivalent to the real physical wave energy dissipation liu et al 2016 valanto and hong 2015 although the original nmri semi empirical models have been continuously further developed to better estimate the added resistance due to wave reflections it has a weak theoretical estimation capacity in the short wave region especially when λ 0 3 l p p more specifically it cannot catch up with the tail increase for the high frequency short wave reflections for example this weakness of the nmri models is presented in fig 4 for the model tests from dtc container kvlcc2 tanker and hsva cruise model presented in e g liu et al 2016 valanto and hong 2015 liu and papanikolaou 2016b guo and steen 2011 sadat hosseini et al 2013 moctar et al 2015 therefore in this paper a wave length correction factor was tuned and added in the original nmri semi empirical model viz 14 r a w r 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 b b f α t 1 α u 0 19 c b λ l p p f n 1 11 where the wave length correction factor is settled by block coefficient c b froude number f n and the ratio between wave length λ and ship length l p p furthermore k e t is proposed to replace k t as the non dimensional frequency in the draft coefficient 15 α t 1 e 2 k e t where k e k 1 ω cos β 2 and ω ω v g the circular frequency of incident regular waves ω wave number of incident regular waves k the new modified formulas have presented more flexible prediction performance in the short wave region as shown in fig 4 where the proposed formula of eq 14 in this study is denoted as cth this flexible formula can help to match the reasonable resistance increase in the extremely short wave regions 3 2 improved models for added resistance due to ship motions in parallel to the research development of added wave resistance by fujii and takahashi 1975 during the 1970s a separate semi empirical model was developed by jinkine and ferdinande 1974 based on the experiment data of a fine hull fast cargo ship this model is found to be a reasonable approximation of added resistance for long waves and often used as a basis for the succeeding development in e g ittc and other research communities to estimate added wave resistance due to ship motions the original model is written as 16 r a w m j f 4 ρ g ζ a 2 b 2 l p p ω b 1 exp b 1 d 1 1 ω d 1 a 1 a 2 where a 1 is the amplitude factor a 2 is the speed correction factor b 1 and d 1 are the slope adjustment factors and ω is the frequency factor the amplitude factor originally proposed by jinkine and ferdinande 1974 has been continually modified the most recent development was proposed by liu and papanikolaou 2016a and further tuned in this study and expressed by 17 a 1 60 3 c b 1 34 1 c b 1 f n while block coefficient c b and froude number f n were used as modification parameters the speed correction factor a 2 in eq 16 has also been extended to the speed span of 0 f n 0 3 compared to the original high speed domain ittc 2012 grin 2012 liu and papanikolaou 2016a in this study through the careful analysis of all collected experimental data it is found that the speed correction factor a 2 is susceptible to the longitudinal radius of gyration k y y and the block coefficient c b in high speed region and it has a little bit steeper slope compared to the ntua formula when f n 0 12 hence the following formula is consequently proposed 18 a 2 0 0072 0 24 f n for f n 0 12 f n 1 05 c b 2 3 exp 2 k y y 0 25 k y y 0 25 f n for f n 0 12 where the ceiling function k y y 0 25 and floor function k y y 0 25 can give discrete scales for f n concerning the correlation between k y y and the typical value 0 25 ittc 2017 the proposed eq 18 can consider the k y y variation for different types of ships the value of k y y is fitted with the peak value of those experiment measurements the improvement for estimating added resistance due to ship motions r a w m is presented as 6 cases in fig 5 for example fig 5 a shows the comparison between the ntua method and the proposed method with two model tests for f n 0 12 while fig 5 b presents two comparison cases for f n 0 12 the frequency factor ω is determined by the frequency of heave and pitch motions which resonance response of these motions is regarded as the leading cause of radiation induced added resistance reaching the peak value in head sea liu and papanikolaou 2016a separated the expression to lower and normal speed whereas it is still not able to match the experimental data well for some cases when k y y do not equal to 0 25 especially for hsva cruise valanto and hong 2015 it is also observed that the resonance frequency moves horizontally from λ l p p 1 to λ l p p 1 as the froude number f n increase the trend is influenced by the longitudinal radius of gyration variation as well consequently the expression is further parameter tuned in this study and the modified formula is given by 19 ω l p p g k y y l p p c 1 0 0 5 0 143 1 09 k y y 0 25 0 08 ω for f n 0 05 l p p g k y y l p p c 1 f n 0 143 1 09 k y y 0 25 0 08 ω for f n 0 05 where the root c 1 0 4567 c b k y y 1 689 and the improved expression results are closer to the resonance position assumed as the highest resistance position in experiment measurements as shown in fig 5 c furthermore in this study the slope adjustment is also calibrated with respect to the longitudinal radius of gyration k y y and the block coefficient c b 20 b 1 19 77 c b k y y 36 39 k y y 0 25 for ω 1 c b 0 75 11 k y y 0 25 for ω 1 c b 0 75 12 5 k y y 0 25 for ω 1 c b 0 75 5 5 k y y 0 25 for ω 1 c b 0 75 21 d 1 14 for ω 1 c b 0 75 566 l p p b 2 66 2 for ω 1 c b 0 75 566 l p p b 2 66 6 elsewhere while c b 0 75 is adopted as the boundary to define the piece wise the final calculated non dimensional curves demonstrate much better slope peak matching to the model tests 3 3 the proposed semi empirical model for r a w in this study a wave length correction is proposed to be added in the nmri semi empirical model fujii and takahashi 1975 whose draft coefficient is also further modified to consider actual wave energy dissipation when sailing in waves this model is used to estimate added resistance in short waves i e due to wave reflections r a w r in eq 9 furthermore the semi empirical model by jinkine and ferdinande 1974 is further developed by improving the speed correction factor a 2 frequency factor ω slope adjustment b 1 and d 1 the latter developed model is used to estimate added resistance in long waves i e due to wave motions r a w m in eq 9 the summation of the two models leads to the total added resistance due to waves as in eq 9 to summary the evolution of present development of the added resistance r a w for head waves the entire semi empirical model proposed in this study denoted as the cth model is listed in box i 4 validation of the proposed model using model tests in regular head waves the proposed semi empirical model in section 3 is compared with the aforementioned ittc sta2 ntua method for the estimation of added resistance in head waves a number of available ship model test measurements were collected to validate the proposal model i e s175 container fujii and takahashi 1975 takahashi 1988 kvlcc2 tanker guo and steen 2011 sadat hosseini et al 2013 dtc container liu and papanikolaou 2016b moctar et al 2012 hsva cruise valanto and hong 2015 s a van der stel alexandersson 2009 a bulk carrier kadomatsu 1988 and series 60 models with five various block coefficient c b strom tejsen et al 1973 all the required parameters of these studied ships required in the semi empirical models are listed in table 1 for the validation of the proposal semi empirical model and comparison with other methods in addition to illustrated figures to plot the estimated resistance r a w against the model test results the mean squared error mse by hastie et al 2009 is used as an estimator to quantitatively compare the accuracy of those models for each ship model test at a given speed f n under a series of regular waves with frequency ω i i 1 2 n the mse can be calculated by 22 mse 1 n i 1 n r a w ω i r a w ω i 2 where r a w ω i represents the measured resistance and r a w ω i represents the estimated resistance such as by eq 9 or the ntua ittc sta2 methods some typical model test cases selected from six different ships are presented in fig 6 which presents the added resistance due to waves r a w estimated by the proposed method the ittc sta2 method and the ntua method in comparison with the model test results the comparison of those methods for all the available test ships listed in table 1 are presented in the appendix from figs a 13 to a 23 as fig 6 c shows the proposed formula has significantly improved added resistance estimation for the hsva cruise either in the short wave field tail increase or the long wave field peak value seizing similarly that has resulted in better performance in the resonance region and peak catching for bulk carrier in fig 6 a and s175 container in fig 6 e the ntua approach can surely catch the peak and the resonance region whereas the prediction capacity in the short wave field cannot perform as well as the proposed formula obviously the ittc sta2 method has underestimated for almost all cases furthermore the mses of the added resistance due to waves r a w for the proposed cth model the ittc sta2 model and the ntua model are computed for all the experimental model tests in order to have an easy comparison all the computed mses are normalized in terms of the values from the proposed cth formulas and the corresponding results are listed in table 2 it should be noted that large values of mse mean bad estimation of that method in comparison with the proposed cth formulas as the table expresses the proposed formulas in section 3 3 have the best prediction performance for almost all the studied instances expect 3 cases the best is the ntua model and 1 case the best is the ittc sta2 model in general the proposed semi empirical formulas have shown superior estimation ability than the other considered approaches for the level 1 wave resistance estimation under regular head sea conditions therefore it was adopted in the proposed speed loss prediction model to estimate added resistance due to waves the capability of the speed loss prediction model will be investigated by full scale measurements in the following analysis 5 model validation by full scale measurements at actual head sea conditions the full scale measurements in this paper were recorded from one pctc and one chemical tanker they were instrumented with several sensors and equipment to collect a large amount of ship energy performance related data up to a gigabyte per day the main particulars of these two ships are shown in table 3 and applied as inputs for the following ship resistance calculation for this study the measurement data types from the two ships are quite similar it includes the shaft power and torque along with the rpm from engine rooms the ship draft from the stern and stem longitude latitude speed over ground speed through water and ship headings etc along with the sailing voyages the measurements were recorded with a frequency of 1 hz i e data collection every second while the raw measurements are statistically evaluated every 15 min and erroneous data is filtered for example several typical routes during the sailing recorded by the full scale measurement campaign are illustrated in fig 7 in addition to the two ships main particulars and performance measurement data their baselines obtained from model tests and sea trials such as speed power relationship in calm water conditions wind resistance coefficients etc are provided by shipowners for this study see fig 8 while the wind resistance coefficients c a a measured through wind tunnel tests were adopted for the case study ships the propulsive efficiency η d is extracted from the ship model self propulsion tests at the designed draft for various ship speeds since only full loading condition is considered in this validation study when full scale measurements are used in this study the η d is interpolated from the self propulsion tests for any measured ship speed it should be noted that the propulsion efficiency η d for a ship s actual sailing in waves should be different from that obtained from the experiment tests even for the same ship speed in this study the difference is included in the added resistance in waves 5 1 metocean data for the prediction of a ship s energy performance in a seaway it is the most essential to get accurate sea environments encountered along the ship s sailing routes for these two case study ships the encountered metocean environments i e the mean wave direction d w a v e mean wave period t z significant wave height h s wind speed u w i n d and v w i n d are extracted from the ecmwf reanalysis dataset era5 hourly with 0 25 0 25 degree spatial resolution copernicus 2019 the information of current velocity u c u r r e n t and v c u r r e n t are obtained from the copernicus marine server with the same geographical resolution and the temporal resolution is 24 h cmems 2019 the extracted metocean environments from the hindcast datasets are assumed to be the actually encountered conditions the two ships loaded condition was pulled out from the huge amount of real measurements based on the draft analysis and the relative wave angle along with wind angle were estimated in order to decrease the uncertainty and enrich the studied dataset the relative wave angle between 0 to 10 is considered as the head sea 5 2 the wave height correction factor for wave resistance in head sea based on the analysis of added resistance in waves from the full scale measurements of those two ships it is found that there is a steeper rise in the added resistance as the significant wave height h s increase compared to the linear superposition calculation by the eq 8 it can be caused by the coupled ship motions in severe sea wave condition and rudder induced resistance controlled by the autopilot besides the propulsion efficiency may also be reduced due to the big motions such as the propeller out of water consequently a wave height correction factor c h s h s 3 5 was preliminary proposed and recommended in the added resistance estimation in the real irregular sea conditions viz 23 r a w h s t p γ 2 0 s ω h s t p γ r a w w ζ a ω 2 d ω h s 3 5 in the following comparison analysis for a chosen engine power with the full scale measurements of sailing speed and wave environments h s t z encountered by a case study ship the added resistance due to waves r a w can be estimated by the inverse procedure in fig 3 first the propulsive efficiency η d corresponding to the ship speed v is interpolated from the ship s self propulsion tests then the total resistance r t o t a l is estimated from the engine power p b ship speed v and η d by eqs 2 3 while r c a l m is interpolated from the ship s speed power curve obtained from model tests the added resistance due to wind r a a is evaluated by the eq 6 the actual added resistance due to wave is calculated as r a w r t o t a l r c a l m r a a then an average value and the standard deviation of r a w for the picked engine power speed and wave condition are computed as the reference to be compared with the proposed method the added resistance due to regular head waves r a w under the same speed are calculated by the proposed method in section 3 3 finally the added resistances under actually irregular sea state r a w are computed by both the conventional method without wave height correction as eq 8 and the proposed method with wave height correction as eq 23 where the peak enhancement factor in the jonswap wave spectrum is chosen to be γ 3 3 and γ 1 pierson moskowitz spectrum to investigate the sensitivity of r a w to the shape of a wave spectrum this calculation process is performed several times for various power speed and wave conditions as shown in fig 9 the measurements with engine power around 8800 kw are used for the resistance verification for the studied pctc it has been sailing in calm sea conditions with a maximum significant wave height of less than 3 5 m four wave conditions with significant wave height approximately 0 9 m 1 7 m 2 7 m and 3 4 m are evaluated both the mean and standard deviation of r a w from the measurements are presented in fig 9 again there is a sharp nonlinear increase of r a w against the encountered significant wave height the proposed semi empirical models using wave spectrum with γ 3 3 and wave height correction factor c h s gives very good results of r a w in comparison with the measurement although it has a little bit underestimation for h s 1 7 m for the case study chemical tanker a long time of full scale measurement data is available in this study harsh encountered sea environments with h s more than 8 m can be found from the measurement data the chemical tanker is operated using a power based navigation strategy i e different power settings are used according to encountered sea conditions the power setting onboard the ship is configured into various so called eco setting levels such as eco 2 setting 6660 kw to 7270 kw for relative calm wave eco 5 setting 4830 kw to 5440 kw for severer sea and eco 6 setting 4220 kw to 4830 kw for harsh sea conditions similar calculations for the pctc are performed for the chemical tanker at the above three engine eco setting levels the corresponding results are presented in fig 10 it is again clearly indicated that the γ 3 3 combined with the wave height correction factor has achieved the best prediction performance for almost all the studied cases from h s less than 1 m to h s larger than 7 m it was also observed that except for the significant wave height and ship speed the peak period has a vital influence on the added resistance in waves for the cases h s 6 6 m and h s 7 1 m with eco 6 setting the wave period is almost two times than the cases h s 4 1 m and h s 5 0 with eco 5 setting leading smaller resistance though they have larger wave height it should be noted that for the extraordinary case of h s 8 2 m in fig 10 bottom plot the added wave resistance r a w estimated by the proposed method differs significantly from the measured values the big difference might be caused by that the propulsion efficiency has been dramatically reduced due to the propeller out of the water surface under such large waves furthermore another reason might be that the proposed wave height correction factor needed to be further increased to account for the extensive motions when sailing in so severe wave environments in general the proposed semi empirical models as eq 23 with r a w estimated by eq 9 gives quite good estimations of added wave resistance r a w in comparison with measurement when a proper wave spectrum is used 5 3 validation of the proposed method for speed loss prediction by full scale measurements in order to check the accuracy of the proposed method for the prediction of a ship s speed loss when sailing in actual irregular head wave conditions a fixed power for the case study ships should be first defined then all the sailing waypoints encountering head waves are selected from the measurement data in this study the engine power of around 8800 kw 60 mcr for the pctc and 4300 kw 52 mcr for the chemical tanker for the following speed loss analysis the next is to divide all the selected waypoints into various groups based on their encountered wave environments for example for the pctc ship five groups of sea states are defined with significant wave heights h s approximately to 0 3 m 0 7 m 1 2 m 2 0 m and 3 1 m for the chemical tanker with long period of measurement data five groups of more scattered sea states are defined with significant wave heights h s approximately to 1 4 m 2 0 m 3 2 m 6 6 m and 7 1 m while the values of h s within the range of 0 05 m are regarded as the same sea states for the pctc and the chemical tanker at the defined engine power settings their speeds under calm water conditions v c a l m are computed to be 16 9 kn and 12 8 kn respectively then for each individual sea state the real sailing speeds v r e a l are estimated using the procedures presented in fig 3 where the added resistance due to waves are estimated by the proposed method furthermore the actual sailing speeds v r e a l under all these sea states are calculated as the mean values of the measured speeds for all those waypoints with the same sea state the comparison of v r e a l between the measured mean values and the estimated by the proposed method is presented in figs 11 and 12 for the pctc and the chemical tanker respectively as illustrated in the two figures the maximum speed loss for the case study pctc at h s 3 1 m is about 2 4 kn i e 14 involuntary speed reduction caused by the sea environments for the chemical tanker due to the highest encountered sea states of h s 7 1 m the maximum speed loss is 4 9 kn i e about 40 in voluntary speed reduction it should be noted that under this very high sea state the chemical tanker s power was already reduced by about 40 in comparison with her normal service conditions if one compares the actual measured speeds and the estimated speeds in general the proposed models show consistently excellent prediction through all considered wave conditions for the case study pctc with a maximum difference of about 0 2 kn the same agreement has also been observed for the chemical tanker in fig 12 while the validation cases start from h s 1 4 m to the harsh sea condition with significant wave height more than 7 m 4 5 h s 5 5 m was skipped because of too little measurements in that range it should be noted that for the pctc in fig 11 there is a consistently slight underestimation of added resistance due to waves leading to higher estimated speeds v r e a l while there is also an almost consistently slight overestimation of added resistance for the chemical tanker it might indicate that a ship type related correction factor should be considered in the proposed model for speed power modeling since the difference is small it will not be further investigated in this study 6 conclusions this study proposed several improvements of current semi empirical models for a ship s speed loss prediction when sailing in head sea conditions it includes improved semi empirical formulas for added resistance due to regular head waves through combining the further developed nmri formulas fujii and takahashi 1975 for short waves due to wave reflections and the improved semi empirical models from jinkine and ferdinande 1974 for long waves due to wave motions the improved semi empirical models have been validated by an abundant of published experimental data in regular waves with sufficiently accurate approximations compared to the other two existed well known approaches furthermore a special contribution in this study is to propose a wave height correction factor in the conventional formula by integrating wave spectrum with the semi empirical added resistance in regular waves to estimate the added resistance due to actual sea states irregular waves described by wave spectrum two case study ships with full scale measurements available are used to verify the proposed models for both the estimation of added resistance and speed loss prediction due to actual sea states the measurements recorded among others ship speed heading position and shaft power etc while the reanalysis sea environmental data are applied to obtain the wave and wind conditions along with the measured sailing voyages for the added resistance due to irregular head waves the proposed models with the wave height correction factor using the jonswap wave spectrum give very good estimations in comparison with measured values for most of the investigated sea states one exceptional case is for the extremely harsh sea state with h s of more than 8 2 m even the extra added wave height factor still seriously underestimates the added resistance because the extreme waves caused motions may affect the estimation of propulsion efficiencies in the analysis for the speed loss prediction under actual sailing sea environments significant speed losses are observed from the two ships measurement data with a maximum 14 speed reduction at h s of 3 meters for the pctc and 40 speed reduction for the chemical tanker at h s of 7 meters in addition to certain voluntary speed reduction the proposed models give excellent results in comparison with the measured results for both ships the good agreement is obtained even for the high waves of h s of more than 7 m in general the proposed semi empirical models
